[00:00.000 --> 00:21.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:45.000 --> 00:55.000]  Tell-to-Tell with the New World Order, Temple of the Spear.
[00:55.000 --> 01:05.000]  We are live on this Wednesday, September 14th, global, worldwide, pro-human, pro-family, pro-god, transmission.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  Wow, what a broadcast we've got lined up for you today.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  We can put the full show headline up on screen. It tells it all.
[01:21.000 --> 01:29.000]  Global Bomb Show, secret Israeli government report with video of the report from their health ministry head,
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  confirms COVID-vax causing massive side effects in death.
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  No, our top story is not going to be a show trial in Connecticut and all the fraud that's going on up there.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  We'll cover some of that today, and it's incredible, and Robert Barnes joins us.
[01:45.000 --> 01:56.000]  But this, and all the other information coming out, is the proof of the premeditated, global, UN, W-E-F, big pharma-directed mass murder.
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  There's video, there's documents, it's confirmed the Israeli health ministry.
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  Talking about the massive increase in death, confirming the German numbers, 40% increase in death.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  That's four or five times the increase in death in World War II.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  Not just in Israel, but all over the Western world that took these shots, between 18 and 63 working age,
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  and overall 27% increase in all deaths combined.
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  I mean, this is just unbelievable mass genocide, and it's just out there like it's no big deal.
[02:30.000 --> 02:39.000]  You know, I saw a Bill Maher clip when he was on with Aaron Rodgers,
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  and Rodgers said 60,000 people died of Vioxx, and Bill Maher didn't believe it.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  And it turned out in documents I have here that Vioxx, Merck that owns Vioxx,
[02:48.000 --> 02:56.000]  knew that it was killing people when they got it approved, and then Maher doesn't believe it.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  I went and pulled the numbers up.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  Now, that doesn't sound right.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Mainstream news at the time when it came out said 60,000.
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  It was half a million confirmed, and I have the studies, and later mainstream articles.
[03:10.000 --> 03:20.000]  Not 60,000, not 60,000, ladies and gentlemen, but half a million.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  What is that, almost 10 times?
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  And they knew it caused heart attacks, and they did it.
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  Now, on a scale of 1 to 100, Vioxx is a 2.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  In the past, it was 100.
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  It was the worst example of them knowing a drug would kill you.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  Now, it's like a 2 compared to what they've done with the COVID shot being 100.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  It's the new benchmark of the highest level.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  Unbelievable, and I have a whole stack where the CDC first said we made mistakes.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  Now, they go, well, we suppressed the fact that it was killing people.
[03:57.000 --> 03:58.000]  Mainstream news.
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.000]  We knew it was killing people.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  We knew it was hurting people.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  Held the CDC document in October of 2000 before they released the stinking shot.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  Three months before, they predicted heart attacks, myocarditis, infertility, cancer, strokes, everything else.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  Blood clots.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  I mean, that's who these people are.
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  They are maniac crazy people carrying out an environmental death cult killing people.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  Of course, they've got weaponized trials.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  Of course, they're getting rid of due process.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  Of course, they're coming for your guns.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  Of course, they're dissolving the borders.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  Of course, they're devaluing the currency.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  Of course, they're cutting off the pipelines and gas and oil.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  Oh, my God.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  It is just so insane.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  And that's just one stack.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  Every one of these stacks is insane.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  The Russians said, okay, we're probably going to have a nuclear war.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  I mean, it's just insane.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  Direct war with robot armies of drones with the Russians right now.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  And the Russian doctors, when they lose, they use nuclear weapons.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  I mean, we could wake up dead tomorrow.
[05:00.000 --> 05:08.000]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant,
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  and to defend our immune systems.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  Now, over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced,
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  top of the line, as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain broke down
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year.
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle, jam-packed, is back in stock
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  for a limited time at infowarstore.com, 30% off.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  And this limited time left time to go into all the great things it does or what it has inside.

[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  And what's just as amazing is, it funds the info war and keeps us on air.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  We're all under globalist attack.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients that are in this product.
[05:55.000 --> 06:11.000]  Get yours today at 25% off at infowarstore.com, now back in stock.
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.000]  Let me calmly now just go over the news headlines.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  The CDC now admits they covered up vaccine deaths and damage consciously.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  They're covering their tracks as I know it's coming out in court.
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  The Israeli government has released documents and videos that have been leaked that confirmed a real.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  Not criminal investigation of how it was released.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  Confirming mass death and mass illness from the shots similar to what we've seen around the world.
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  And what the insurance actuaries are showing, incredible.
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  Then we've got dozens of clips.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  There's no way to even play all of these.
[07:14.000 --> 07:24.000]  We've got a lot of footage of Hillary Clinton and Democrat Congress people like Representative Ryan, Tim Ryan.
[07:24.000 --> 07:30.000]  Coming out and saying, quote, we need to kill the MAGA extremists, close quote.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  They're fully weaponized.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  Hillary said, conservatives from supporters are al-Qaeda.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  We have the video.
[07:39.000 --> 07:48.000]  I told you in last June, 2021, Biden put out that report saying the main terror threats the American people and conservatives that question lockdowns,
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  forced inoculations, or election fraud, or open borders.
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  I mean, this is just an amazing, amazing time to be alive.
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  We've got that stack in all those videos.
[08:00.000 --> 08:13.000]  Then we've got not 50 people visited by the FBI or swat team by the FBI, but hundreds now.
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  When Steve Bannon was on a few days ago, it was 35.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  Then a few days ago, it was 50 plus.
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  Now it's 100 plus.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  Mike Lindell joins us coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[08:26.000 --> 08:32.000]  He got stopped and surrounded by the FBI and his phone grabbed.
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  They're making their move against the American people.
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  Trump slams weaponized police state after Fed sees Mike Lindell's phone and more.
[08:40.000 --> 08:48.000]  Meanwhile, Biden celebrates Inflation Reduction Act as stock market tanks due to rising inflation.
[08:48.000 --> 08:57.000]  The WEF has announced how they're going to push the new all bug diet, but it's not all bug, they call it all bug, but they're going to mix nano tech into it.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  And the FDA has said as of a year ago, no jurisdiction, put whatever you want in it.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  That is in and of itself from their own website.
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  WEF is just beyond insane.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  The Fed is announcing the biggest rate hike in more than 20 years next week that will crash the housing market.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  And we've got that.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  We've got videos and documents from around the country and here in Texas.
[09:23.000 --> 09:33.000]  2000 meals, Texas style newly discovered police body cam footage implicates top Tarrant County, Texas Democrat officials in ballot harvesting.
[09:33.000 --> 09:41.000]  The BLS inflation index for food highest since 1979.
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  It's all coming up today and let me tell you who's on the broadcast.
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  Roger Stone to break down the midterms, 25 days out in the purge.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  Robert Barnes is doing live 24 hour day coverage of the Connecticut.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  Anti free speech anti second amendment show trial where I've already been found guilty and my lawyer is admonished.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  He'll be sanctioned if he even talks about anything.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  He's just there to be a puppet and just make people think it's an actual trial.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  I've already found guilty by judge. It's just next level and saying that a bunch of insane clips there.
[10:12.000 --> 10:21.000]  The judge is already up there saying she will sanction me once I get there into their web.
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  And again, as I said, Mike Lindell joining us and Pete Santelli fourth hour on this whole purge.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  I'll be hosting some of the fourth hour with him.
[10:29.000 --> 10:38.000]  The globalist and launch their operation they're going full out and trying to compress what they were planning to do from 2020 2030 in their own agenda 2030 battle plan.
[10:38.000 --> 10:48.000]  I kept warning you about people say how do he 20 years ago and 10 years ago specifically exactly and all these viral Alex Jones videos that are everywhere say exactly how it would happen.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  Well, I was quoting them.
[10:50.000 --> 11:05.000]  But they meant to get that what's happening now done in the next six, seven, eight years instead they're having to compress it and just to a couple because populist and nationalist from Canada to Italy to Brazil to you name it are getting elected and their anti-New World Order.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  And they understand the great reset.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  They understand the economic war.
[11:10.000 --> 11:22.000]  And so humanities really has hit that awakening growth curve and it is panicking the establishment in a ultra massive way.
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.000]  So we're going to be laying all this out today and I'm going to hit the huge absolutely mom show.
[11:29.000 --> 11:40.000]  Information next segment on the poison shots with the Israeli government is admitting.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  And it's again it's in Hebrew.
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.000]  So we'll put it up there with the documents and the close captioning in English.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  But that's the next segment.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  That's why they want to software.
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.000]  That's why they want to shut us down because nobody anywhere has got the full spectrum analysis of what the globalist are doing.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  And they know if we continue to grow and continue to fight, they're going to lose.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  That's why their number one mission is to take out Trump and to take out info wars.
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  Trump isn't perfect, but he definitely wants to be president.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  He doesn't like the globalist being in charge.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  They see him as a threat to their power with info wars.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  They know we've got the blueprint of their operation and if people keep listening, which is happening, they're going to lose.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  So two big announcements.
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  I am very honored and very blessed and very thankful to viewers and listeners.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  And Steve Bannon and others that pushed the great reset in the war for the world.
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000]  This book to number one in the U.S. and in the top 10 in the world.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  And of course the New York Times suppressed that.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  It's now backfired and the book is absolutely exploding.
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  Now people say well that'll fix your financial problems.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  At current sales rates within the next four to five months, I'll probably bring in $2 million.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  We need that for the crew, the bandwidth, the salary up links, the legal fees.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  That is not a drop in the bucket, but it's like filling your tank up a third of the way.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  The expenditures we have running our own infrastructure.
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  It's a great thing, but I only get a couple dollars a book when it's sold in stores.
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  If a book sold for 20 something bucks in a store, it's being sold to them by the publisher for 10 bucks.
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  Same thing with Amazon.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  After all the expenses and things, you get a couple bucks. That's great.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  But if you want to support the broadcast and really want to fight hard,
[13:26.000 --> 13:35.000]  the last of the 14,000 signed books we sold was, well, the last ones I'm going to sign today.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  There's like 500 more I've got to get done.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  I've signed over 10,000 books.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  And so they'll all be shipped out by the day or tomorrow while I'm a little behind.
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  Let's just say Friday.
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  So some of you ordered a month ago pre-order.
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  Thanks for waiting.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  Most of you already got it, but this weekend I was just too burnt out.
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.000]  I didn't sign it this weekend.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  Well, I sound like 500, but I was just too exhausted.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  I'm not complaining.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  I just couldn't do it.
[14:01.000 --> 14:10.000]  But it was such a hot fundraiser selling these with a big markup that are signed
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  that we looked at the numbers.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  We would be, again, in the red if it wasn't for the thousands of you
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  that bought the book signed with the big markup.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  Yes, I know it's a book for $99.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  The whole point is it's part of history.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  That way we make $80 something instead of making, you know, we sell it ourselves.
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.000]  We make like $6, $7.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  The sold on Amazon only make like $2.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  But the point is we need this money to operate.
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.000]  So it's a fundraiser.
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  Just like when NPR or PBS who already get taxpayer money, but they need a supplement of extra money,
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.000]  they'll sell a coffee cup for $50, a DVD for $100, a t-shirt for $200, a ball cap for $100.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  And you know there's a giant markup because it's a fundraiser.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  So I had said I can't sign any more of these, but 10,000 more arrived yesterday early.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  We sold out of the signed and unsigned 20,000 of them.
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  So we just pulled it out the shopping cart yesterday when the truck arrived.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  We thought it was arriving like a week.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  The truck arrived.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  So we have 10,000 more of the books.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  So 4,000 will be unsigned.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  6,000 will be signed.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  And this is a godsend that these came in.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  And it's a godsend you bought them at the increased price.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  So please go to infowarstore.com.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  We'll put banners effect under the live show feed.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  We'll put a link to buy the fundraiser book signed by yours truly,
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  a piece of history of the Death Star plans.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  Thank you.

[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  Teddy Roosevelt.
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  Citizen of a Republic, the man in the arena.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence in the world.
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  It will never be made again.
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.000]  And it's not just an amazing historic coin.
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  It funds the information war against the globalist.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  This is something you want to own.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  against the globalist.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.

[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  1776coin.com.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas,
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer,
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.000]  or a millionaire.
[18:07.000 --> 18:10.000]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  You see it every year.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over,
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  because they're part of the system
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  and they don't want the general public understanding this
[18:25.000 --> 18:26.000]  and knowing this.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  So it's a very important situation with inflation
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  that allows you to keep more money.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  great tax advice in the last few years.
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL,
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  or call 833-904-285.
[18:53.000 --> 19:22.000]  833-904-285.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  Top 10.
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  They all had the same ingredients in common
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  that is in this product.
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force,

[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also Exercise.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now

[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  You need to take this product.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  It really works.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[20:05.000 --> 20:31.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  We found the answer.
[20:32.000 --> 20:35.000]  Let me know the future you are looking for.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  I won't get what I'm after.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  I won't get to get what I'm after.
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  It's the day I die.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  Just get born again, brother.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  You will die a second death.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  You'll be born again.
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  People tend to hate me
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  because I never smile
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  as I ran sat at home
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  to want to shake my hand.
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  Focusing on nowhere,
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  investigating miles.
[21:03.000 --> 21:11.000]  I'm a seeker, I'm a really desperate man.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  Thank you for joining us on this live
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  Wednesday, September 14, Transmission.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  Woo!
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  We are in the New World Order now.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  Alright, let's get deadly serious here.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  The globalists have said they want to depopulate us.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  They've said there's too many people.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  There's been infertility sterilization vaccines.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  They've been caught all over the world
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  giving third-world populations polio
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  through the shots and sterilence of tetanus shots.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  It's all on record for anybody that wants to research it.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  It's like it's on record that hydrofluorosalic acid in the water
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  lowers your IQ and gives you bone cancer
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  and stunts your growth and so much more.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  But they just call it conspiracy theory.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  Well, now let's look at this stack of news.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  This is all on infowars.com.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  You can see it yourself.
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  Notice the CDC a month ago said,
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  oh, we made some mistakes.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  We know it's coming out in lawsuits.
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  CDC admits it falsely claimed it was monitoring vaccine safety
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  but still won't release the full data,
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  but now we're admitting that it's killing people.
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  There desperately needs to be some prison time.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  CDC director admits agency gave false information
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  on governing vaccine safety monitoring
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  because they didn't do it,
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  because they'd done secret tests at the CDC
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  and knew it was killing the rats,
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  which is why in the 2000 October report
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  they predicted everything had happened.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  The director admits agency gave false information,
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  lied and said they had tested it
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  because they had and knew it was killing people.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  New science shows vaccine helped Omnicron spread
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.000]  in major peer reviewed study the epic times.
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  And here's the report.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  Immune boosting B-1-0.1529.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  Omnicron depends on previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  Read it for yourself.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  Big study, prestigious study.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  And here is the big smoking gun.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  In a leaked video which the government of Israel
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  is now admitting is real,
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  but they want to arrest who released it,
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  a research team commissioned by the
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  Israeli Ministry of Health warns
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  we have to think, this is a quote,
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  we have to think medical legal.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  How to present our findings to avoid lawsuits.
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.000]  Why?
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  Because of quite a few side effects.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  They said, okay, it exists, report exists,
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  but still get vaccinated.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  They go into the high death numbers,
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  40 plus percent of people 18 to 63 dying.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  That's what the other numbers are showing
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  around the world from insurance companies.
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  Just unbelievable.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  And now an international group of prestigious
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  scientists and doctors have gone public
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  declaration of international medical crisis
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  due to the disease and deaths
[23:43.000 --> 23:48.000]  correlated to the COVID-19 vaccines.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  Need to look this up.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  It's all linked up on infowars.com.
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  MedicalCrisisDeclaration.com.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  And it just goes on from there.
[24:00.000 --> 24:01.000]  Pray.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  Every day we see 50 or 60 of these articles.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  Teen athlete survives mysterious six foot
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  blood clot, but now football's off the table.
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  He did, of course, take the shot.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  And it just gets more crazy.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  Look at this, COVID shot may become
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  annual like the flu shot.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  Says KPI XCBS.
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  Santa Clara County recents COVID vaccine
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  mandate for workers in high risk settings
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  all over the world from Japan to New
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.000]  Zealand.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  They're doing the same thing because it's
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  all globally directed.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  And that leads me now to this
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  important piece of information.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  This is Aaron Rodgers with his
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  surging podcast.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  And I'll just top quarterback around top
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  podcaster to love it.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  And Aaron Rodgers.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  Has Bill Maher on.
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  And he says 60,000 died.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  50 to 60,000 from Vioxx.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  And.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Bill Maher can't believe it.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  But I was like, wait a minute, that was
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  over a decade ago.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  I remember covering it.
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  It was a half million.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  They finally admitted.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  Half million deaths.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  Over two million heart attacks alone.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  So two million heart attacks.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  Half a million deaths.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Rodgers is going off Associated Press
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  Reuters early findings of 50 to 60,000
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  deaths.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  The number they generally use is 56,000.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  I have the articles.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  I'll show them to you.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  Just type in number of Vioxx deaths
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.000]  into a search engine.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  You'll get it.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  I have university studies.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  I have mainstream news later saying
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  half a million.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  So no Aaron Rodgers is wrong.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  Not a bad guy.
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  But he's the guy quoting the old number.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  Maher can't believe it.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  So you've got Maher and it can't believe it,
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  but agrees it's bad.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  Then you've got Rodgers saying 56,000.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  And the real number is 10 times that.
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  Half a million.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  So here is Bill Maher on Aaron Rodgers yesterday.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  So to freak out that Justin Turner or to have,
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  there are colleges.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  These woke colleges that are out of their mind.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  We're talking about the people who are
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  never going to die from this 22 year olds,
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  20 year olds, and they are masking outside
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  at my alma mater, Cornell.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  They have to wear masks outside.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  They get their meals like left at the door.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  They're masking a Berkeley.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  Oh, I'm sure Berkeley, of course.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  And this is all just, this is ideology.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  This is not medicine.
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  This is indoctrination.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  This is, and to me, the frightening thing
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  was never the disease itself.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  The frightening thing was how much you could,
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  you could get people so quickly
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  to change their way of life.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  Stay home.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  Wear a mask.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  You know, don't do it.
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  It was altruistic at first.
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.000]  It's like, ah, yeah.
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  Yeah, of course.
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  Take two weeks to flatten the curve, right?
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  And then just about, well,
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  every conspiracy theory came true.
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  Vaccine mandates, vaccine passports.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  Right.
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  And it turned into, like, away from doing your job
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  to stop the spread to, like, lockdowns.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  And that's my whole problem.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  You know, I grew up in a small town.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  Very little cases up in Chico, California.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  But all the small businesses are f***ing gone.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  I mean, our favorite restaurants in L.A. and New York
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  and across the country, not just in big cities.
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  Look, some crazy percentage will never open again.
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.000]  Why?
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  Absolutely.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  And then what are we doing for them?
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  What are we doing for the small businesses?
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  Well, there were some PPE loans
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  and stuff that people could file for.
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  Well, we did.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  We passed out $6 trillion.
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  And the sad fact about that is that
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  a very big, big, big chunk of it was just flat out stolen.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  Yeah.
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  I mean, we spent more to keep people hiding under the bed
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  than we did for World War II.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  World War II cost $4 trillion.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  And we passed out almost $6 trillion for this.
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  I mean, wow, talk about a country that's gone a little soft.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  Well, that's a pleasant screw-up
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  because I sent the crew the clip of them on Vioxx.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  I don't know how that happened, but that was pretty powerful.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  So we'll have to back Mike Lindell off
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  because this is more important.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  Cancel Mike Lindell.
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  It's fine.
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  We'll come back with the clip.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  Guys, I'm going to send it to you again.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  I sent it to you this morning.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  And I'm just going to do the best job I can here.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  So it's all I can do
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  because it's a big deal.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  They're saying $60,000 and it's half a million.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  I was going to show those documents.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  But wow, I'm not mad.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  It's just like the more important something is,
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  the more it doesn't happen.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  Man.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  Oh, God.
[28:53.000 --> 29:06.000]  This makes me so mad how many people are killing.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules.

[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  What does ultimate mean?
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  That's just our name for the best,
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  the highest grade.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  What this concentrated
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  anchovy oil,
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  pure arctic krill oil
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  and high quality wild caught salmon oil
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  does for your brain,
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  your heart, your cardiovascular system
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  and for your entire body's functions
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  is insane.
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  Regular low grade fish oil
[30:28.000 --> 30:30.000]  in all the studies
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  does outstanding things.
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  This is the highest grade
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  and it's not been pasteurized,
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  it's not been boiled, so it has
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  its original effects intact.
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  should visit infowarstore.com today
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  and get ultimate fish oil

[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  For our regular fans and our big supporters
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  you're gonna love it, you already know how great it is.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  But for folks that have been on the fence,
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.000]  experience ultimate fish oil for yourself,
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  try taking some before bedtime
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  and see what happens with your dreams.
[31:00.000 --> 31:02.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  does fantastic things
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  for your cardiovascular system,
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  for your brain, for every part of your body.
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  But what I don't see being
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  promoted is the fact that
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  it has natural
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  psychotropic effects.
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  It certainly does for me.
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  from an hour before bed, my sleep
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  and my dreams are amazing.
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  Now there are actually some studies out there
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  linking it to amazing
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  events in the brain.
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  But I want you to experience it yourself.
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  We know it's good for your heart.
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  We know it's good for your brain.
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  and every other function in your body.
[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  But I want you to experience
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  this high grade fish oil, this ultimate fish oil

[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  before bedtime.

[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  now exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[31:54.000 --> 31:56.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[31:56.000 --> 32:16.000]  You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  They've got the ace of spades in their hand
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  which is false flags.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  Before you launch a war, you stage false flags.
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  That's the first thing you do.
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  Nobody wants to say they started a war.
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  Bad guys start wars.
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  Every time a war gets launched by bad guys
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  they stage an event.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  You know, people get upset if their football team loses.
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.000]  I don't because it doesn't matter.
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  And I love the crew.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  And what happened to Mike Lindell
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  being read by the FBI is important
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  and we love Mike.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  I got a jam-packed show with a bunch of guests.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  The reason I cleared the decks here
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  is this needs to be covered
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  because not even my trial
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  or InfoWars being crucified
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  is important compared to this
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  information.
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  Governments and insurance companies
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  are confirming
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  40% plus
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  death rates of any year
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  ever recorded.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  We are being murdered.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  And so I'm pissed looking at these studies
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  and knowing they're doing it.
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  And then I watched this Aaron Rodgers clip
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  with Bill Maher.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  I'm glad they messed up and somehow got the wrong clip.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  Love the crew because it showed them
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  actually saying some coaching smart things.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  I hadn't seen that clip.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  But the clip I've got is them talking about
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  Vioxx and because this is the key
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  to everything.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  And I got to make this point.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  This is the key.
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  And it's in all the articles.
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  It's in the documents. If you remember, it's admitted.
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  You can go look up the Vioxx case.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  Don't believe me. They knew in studies
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  they did that it caused
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  a huge increase in freaking heart attacks
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  and death.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  They are murdering people. Who are these people?
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  They're a eugenics cult.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  What big pharma is?
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  And they take turns just like
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  Bayer did
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  in the 80s and 90s
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  with the Clintons out of Arkansas
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  certifying blood as HIV and hepatitis free,
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  mixing it into the factor 8 blood product
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  and giving millions of people
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  hepatitis and HIV and causing
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  millions of deaths.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  And Merck settled the Vioxx
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  lawsuit
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  for $4.85 billion
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  but made tens of billions
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  in profit
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  off of it. And so this is
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  years ago
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  Vioxx is one of the biggest poison drug scandals
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  ever.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  It didn't just kill a half a million. It killed
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  way more than that. You could say probably
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  the biggest scandal was the
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  Bayer tainted blood situation.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  But it shows who
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  these people are. Merck
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  and Bayer and Pfizer and Moderna
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  and J&J and all of them know
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  exactly
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  what they're doing.
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  And so Bill Mars on with him
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  and can't believe 50
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  to 60,000 died. That was when it first
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  came out. The number that's
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  admitted and I'll show you the mainstream news articles
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  and studies is half
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  a million people. Before that it was a quarter
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  million. Who knows what it was
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  later. That's just the people that killed right away.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  And now on a scale of 1 to 100
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  the tainted blood
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  by
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  Pfizer
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  by Bayer
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  the tainted
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  poison garbage
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  that they put out
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  is like a three or four
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  on the Richter scale of 1 to 100.
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  I know the Richter scale is 1 to 10
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  but on a scale of 1 to 100 it's like a three
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  or four. And you've got
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  the Vioxx as a two or three
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  as well.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  And now the new benchmark
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  the new high is the
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  COVID shot from Moderna and Pfizer
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  and J&J and AstraZeneca all
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  designed the same with different delivery systems
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  to kill your ass.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  And to mutate your body and to make you
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  sickly and to erase your immune system
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  and they're just doing it and it's
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  all admitted it's insane.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  And then you go to CNN
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  ABC's
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  top of Twitter today. It's Alex Jones the villain
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  Alex Jones the devil. People say
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  how do you take it? How do you take all these attacks?
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  They're literally murdering hundreds
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  of millions of people globally right now
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  with soft kill, degenerative
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  mutinogenic
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  that mutate your DNA
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  cancer causing weapons.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  That's why I'm freaked out. That's why
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  I'm upset. That's why I'm so pissed.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  I'm not pissed. They played the wrong clip.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  I am already pissed
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  controlling myself.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  Sitting here watching this happen and watching
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  the power structure of the media
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  and the corporations and the bureaucrats
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  and the lawyers and all these idiots
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  going along with the new world order
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  pretending like they're the good liberals
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  pretending like they're the heroes when they're a eugenics
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  depopulationist
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  death cult.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  Fuck these people.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  Damn these people to hell and I mean that
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  when I say it.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  I am so sick of the new world order.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  I am so sick of this
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  cult of psychopaths. I am so sick
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  of their lies and their fraud.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  I don't believe anything they say.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  And I apologize for nothing I've ever done
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  because I did it all from a place of purity
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  and I've been 98%
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  accurate. I told the truth
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  on purpose. I took on the globalist
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  on purpose because I won't sign
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  on and be part of this.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  And I'll say this.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  I've talked to a lot of heavy hitters that talk to Trump daily.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  I can talk to Trump if I want to.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  I just started getting his face so that's why
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  he didn't like talking to me.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  I'm not going to proudly say what I've told Trump last time
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  I talked to him.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  But listen you arrogant pig
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  headed creature.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  You're crossing the Rubicon
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Trump
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  with this shot.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  The globalist hates you
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  but you got conned to go along with this
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  and now that it's all come out it's killing people on record
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  and they knew it killed people and the CDC's already
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  let the sick of ship and amidst a line
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  and knew it was killing people and you still push it.
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  And I hate getting mad at Trump
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  because I have been persecuted
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  and put to the gauntlet for supporting him.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  So the reverse psychology is
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  well I'm going to support Trump. I'm being persecuted for Trump
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  but I'm going to rock in a hard place because
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  I will not sign
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  on to the death and disease
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  and painful slow
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  kill of our children.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  Let me play the actual Aaron Rodgers
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  Bill Mark Clip now
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  and we're going to post this to Band-Aid
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  video later we'll put the clip up front and edit this down
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  where it's cogent and focused.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  I'm going to show you the main line news articles and studies
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  where it's a half million
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  not
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  50 to 60,000 that Bill Mark
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  can't believe. Just let that sink in
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  they knew
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  they did it and the system
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  find them a quarter of their profit
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  for what they did because they were carrying out
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  a holy mission to set the precedent
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  to kill people and normalize it
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  and I'm tired of it. Here it is.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  And they
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  this is so like
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  a recapitulation
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  of what we've seen with COVID recently
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  it's like no the government
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  stepped in the powers that be
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  the people who think they have the billions
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  and said no Ricky Williams
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  you can't do the thing that works for you
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  that you know works for you. You have to do
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  the pharmaceutical version of it
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  and Ricky was like I don't want to do the pharmaceutical
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  version it doesn't work as good and it's
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  worse for me.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  This is like when they people were dying from
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  Bayox which is distributed
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  super widely
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  and then what
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  recalled.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  And then they got sued
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  and they paid out 5 billion
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  but they made 12 billion
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  Bayox relieves
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  the pain of arthritis by killing you.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  There was 5 figures of people that died
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  like 50, 60,000 people
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  that died. How many? 50 or 60,000
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  I believe. We talked about in Rogan's podcast
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  about Bayox and when I was in college
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  everybody was on Bayox
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  all my team is from Bayox. 50,000 people?
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  I think something like that. From Bayox?
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  You know the fact check me those amazing fact
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  checkers. Okay so
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  let's just be clear about that
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  we're not saying we know for sure
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  it's that number
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  which is fine.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  Rogan said on the podcast last week it was 50
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  or 60,000. Okay but I'm not sure
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  about that either. I've never seen that number and it could
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  be but if it is
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  I'll say this. If that number
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  is that high it's kind of a scandal
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  that the media didn't cover it more
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  because I remember the media covering
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  it but not that's
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  astounding number. I mean when opioids
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  which kill more than that every
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  year
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  but the Sackler family
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  who run the drug company
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  that put out oxycontin
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  they have been held accountable now
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  not as much. They should
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  have they? Well they should be
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  many people would say not enough
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  because they should be in jail for what they did.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  Go ahead and cut it off. You can see the full report
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  at infowarch.com but here's the LA Times
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  56,000 deaths
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  and that's an old story
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  of whitewash from 2005
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  years later here's the weak
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  AP all of them half a million deaths
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  okay so Aaron Rodgers is wrong
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  it ain't 60,000
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  it's half a million
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  and counting. That's what's going on

[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  try to take this up before bed time
[46:58.000 --> 47:14.000]  and see what happens with your dreams
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  good friend of mine
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  criminal lawyer as well Robert Barnes joins us
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  into the next hour
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  and no he's not here right now
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  to talk about the show trial in Connecticut
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  that's important
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  we'll hit the incredible developments
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  at the start of the next hour
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  but he's involved suing Pfizer
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  Robert Kennedy Jr. with the big whistleblower
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  to help this whole ball start rolling
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  so I don't get butterflies
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  around Hollywood stars
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  and butterflies
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  until they actually start telling the truth
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  and I do like Aaron Rogers
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  love him
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  but I just get butterflies with Robert Barnes
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  because wherever there's a fight for liberty
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  wherever there's a battle against tyranny
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  he's there and there's just such
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  incredible developments
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  words don't describe it
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  it just gets crazier by the day
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  coming out with the shots
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  major governments banning the shots
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  you don't really see it on the news
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  in my family it's a war against you and your family
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  and I can't do it without your support
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  so I want to thank you all for your past support
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  and I want to encourage you
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  now to know we fired the bat signal
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  we're toe-to-toe I'm battling three show trials
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  all these huge judgments
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  we're in bankruptcy chapter 5 which should keep the operation going
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  we have to be profitable and having to pay the legal bills
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  and the bandwidth and the rest of it
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  we're barely there
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  so we need support this is history
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  if you would have stood up in 1776
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  this is the time to stand up
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  in information warfare
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  in your word of mouth and your prayer
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  and your financial support
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  so go to infowarstore.com right now
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  I'm very pleased
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  that we've gotten all but 500
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  and I'm sorry that some of your
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  shipments are two weeks behind
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  they're shipping out today and tomorrow
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  the next few days most people that were in the book
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  have already gotten the unsigned and the signed
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  but there's still 3-4 thousand books
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  that I just got done in the last few days
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  they're shipping out
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  copies with the fundraiser
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  even though it was funding or operation
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  we're doing 6,000 more signed books
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  because 10,000 came in yesterday
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  4,000 unsigned
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  for 24 bucks
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  or whatever it is
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  the battle plan of the new world order
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  the great reset in the war with the world
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  6,000 more signed
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  and then I want to say I'm going to stop
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  because it's just crazy but that's what people are buying
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  it's what you want and it's what's funding the operation
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  and it's a piece of history
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  the book in America and the top 10 in the world
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  the great reset in the war with the world
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  wherever you want it, Amazon, wherever
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  you want to pay 24 bucks for it
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  but if you want to pay extra as a fundraiser
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  just like NPR does
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  if they get taxpayer money on top of it we don't
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  then go to infowarstore.com
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  and get a signed copy
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  and the good news is we're caught up now
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  so I should get another 6,000 signed
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  when they sell in the next week or so
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  signed very quickly so you won't have to wait
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  3 weeks because the book didn't officially come out
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  in the first week it sold 56,000 copies
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  making it the number one book in the US
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  the New York Times suppressed it get the great reset in the war with the world
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  and know you're a part of history
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  from the infowar at infowarstore.com
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  and buy another unsigned copy while you're there to give to friends and family
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  or donate to a library
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  but it's selling out of bookstores everywhere it's great
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  down the road I'm going to get some big royalty checks
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  I got an $8,000 check yesterday
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  and I told them I said well I'm out of personal money
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  give me 20,000
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  to pay my bills
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  and give 60,000 directly into free speech
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  and what's happening
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  and those monies will start coming in that's great
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  that's wonderful and that's getting a couple bucks a book
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  when it's sold in Amazon
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  but here you do the huge markup

[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  so 1776coin.com
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  all right Robert Barnes we got seven minutes to break
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  you've got the floor on the Israeli
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  government leaked documents admitting it's causing mass death
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  now are they going to suppress it
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  the CDC saying okay we didn't do safety
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  we covered it up we lied
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  beyond criminal activity all these new studies
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  that you're 93 times more likely to die of COVID
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  if you've had the shot
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  British Medical Journal
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  New England Medical Journal I mean this is prestigious
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  major governments banning the shots
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  this is being suppressed
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  but this is happening what in the hell is going on
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  Robert Barnes
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  no doubt and in fact it also came out today
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  that FEMA
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  has been offering people payoffs
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  if they'll agree to
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  re-identify the death of their loved one
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  as a COVID death rather than a vaccine death
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  telling
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  hey you know you could get a special bonus
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  you could get a special amount of money
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  if you will relabel
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  your child's death this happened
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  in a prominent case involving a man who lost his son
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  from the shot from the vaccine
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  that's what's happening that's the scale of corruption
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  so the CDC
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  FEMA
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  governments around the world
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  Denmark's admitting it and acknowledging it implicitly
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  by saying it's not even going to allow
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  the shot for people under 50 years of age
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  this is a recognition
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  that this was a complete disaster
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  complete debacle of a public policy
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  it's why we brought the suit
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  on behalf of Children's Health Defense
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  against the Food and Drug Administration
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  pending in Texas
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  up in Waco in the federal western district
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  of Texas that case is going to decide
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  whether or not the vaccine can continue
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  to be marketed to children period
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  we're trying to stop it in its tracks Bobby Kennedy and I
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  and we have the major suit
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  with Werner Mendenhall and others
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  on behalf of Brooke Jackson
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  against Pfizer that exposes the whole scam
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  and in fact as Brooke Jackson
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  it's this is someone that's been involved
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  in the clinical trial world for forever
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  she was shocked and horrified
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  by what she witnessed I mean it was so bad
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  these clinical trials of the COVID vaccine
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  for Pfizer were so bad
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  that when you walked in you had needles
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  sticking out of out of garbage bags
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  you had people's private medical
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  information hanging out at the janitor's
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  office it was that egregious
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  there was no monitoring of adverse events
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  in any effective way there are under
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  the table payments there was compromise
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  the blinding and now the booster shot
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  was tested on eight rats
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  exactly just eight mice
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  eight mice so you
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  compounded it's just disaster on top
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  of disaster on top of disaster
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  it has been a human catastrophe
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  on a global scale
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  and now people are continuing to track
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  excess death data and what
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  they are finding is two things the more
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  vaccinated an area is the more
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  the excess deaths went up not down
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  not only that it corresponds
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  time wise to when
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  the vaccine and booster shots are rolled out
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  is when there are these sudden spikes
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  and excess deaths particularly
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  as Edward Dowd has been reporting as
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  people from Wall Street told me six months ago
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  the
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  insurance data is showing this as well
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  so we have CDC
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  scandals FDA scandals
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  FEMA scandals all
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  with Wall Street data
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  insurance data global data all
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  pointing to the same thing which was
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  this vaccine was a complete
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  travesty of justice
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  and for Trump
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  I understand he's got his ego invested
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  in this because he was tricked into it
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  but the exit path
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  out for President Trump is to
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  embrace Brooke Jackson's whistleblower
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  case and say look
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  I wanted a safe effective vaccine
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  for people I've been a lot
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  of money to make sure it happened
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  they lie he's gotta he's gotta own it
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  and say he was lied to because now as this all comes out
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  he's gonna get the blame I predicted that
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  a year ago months ago now they're already doing it
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  exactly so
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  this gives him that exit ramp he doesn't have
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  to renounce his decision to push this
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  a lot of us both of us at the time
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  it was a bad idea but he doesn't have to deal
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  with that aspect he can say look
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  Brooke Jackson's case proves that
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  Pfizer lied to me this is big pharma
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  they've been waging war on me for years
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  or he can sit there like a dumb piece of shit
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  and let them set him up for this
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  yeah if he falls into the trap
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  that continues to support this then he
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  puts himself at unnecessary political
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  risk and exposure the Brooke Jackson
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  case provides an easy
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  exit ramp for Trump to say you know what
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  I like the American people
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  were tricked and deceived and fooled
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  and lied to by big pharma willing to
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  line their own pockets and remember they did to him
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  during the election the reason he was pushing
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  they deliberately delayed
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  letting people know that it even existed
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  until after election day to hurt his election
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  so he owes them nothing
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  he owes the American people everything
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  so what he should do is say look they lied
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  to me plus he should exactly look at the polls
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  this is the biggest thing turning his supporters away
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  this is killing Trump
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  absolutely so the best way to
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  deal with all this embrace the Brooke Jackson case
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  expose the law and destroy the deep
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  state because they did it
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  absolutely this was another deep state
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  plot set up trap to go after
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  Trump and we're seeing how they're desperate
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  to keep him out of power this is the
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  this is the one place that he has a weakness
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  this is the one weakness he can easily fix
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  he can easily remedy
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  by admitting and I understand he did have
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  the best intentions he wanted people to
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  not be at risk from this virus that's understandable
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  just like this like the Regeneron
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  turned out to work great and he greenlit
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  that and they weren't lying to him and it worked
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  he could say I was right about Regeneron
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  but my god they lied about the side
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  effects they're to blame he's got to separate himself
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  now exactly
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  he's gotta say they lied all the way through
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  they said it was safe it's not safe they said
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  it was effective it's not effective they said
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  it was a vaccine it ain't even a vaccine
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  it's killing kids it's killing
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  young people across the world it's time
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  for Trump to step into the gap
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  and say they lied to him and he opposes it
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  and it should not continue
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  it should not be in existence any further
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  and that they need to be held accountable and responsible
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  and support and embrace
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  Brooke Jackson's whistleblower case
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  to stop Pfizer and hold Pfizer
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  fully accountable needs to happen
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  that's right it was all big pharma and big medical
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  just raping everybody
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  alright coming up you told me on the phone this morning
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  you've never seen such a show trial
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  you've been doing live coverage of it with millions of viewers
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  Robert Barnes is our guest we'll be right back
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  next hour on the weaponization, the judiciary
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  and beyond please stay with us
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  the rage for more than a decade

[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  wheatgrass and so many other
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  ingredients that are known to make us healthy
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  to make us vibrant
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  and to defend our immune systems
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  now over a year and a half ago

[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  top of the line
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  as good as it's gonna get
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  but then the supply chain broke down
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  finally green fiber capsules

[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  literally
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  I'm gonna tell you a little story
[59:34.000 --> 59:36.000]  um
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  we had one too
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  you wouldn't believe it
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  anyway so it's infowarstore.com
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  and that's how we fund this operation
[59:44.000 --> 59:48.000]  if you don't want to share that's fine
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  ladies and gentlemen Robert Barnes
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  is on the tip of the spear
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  fighting big pharma tyranny and the wheels have come off
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  the mass deaths admit it's being banned by major government
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  Israel's released secret documents
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  where they know it's killing everybody
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  Mars spend a few minutes on this
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  and we'll shift into the weaponization
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  of the judiciary and their path
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  they believe the victory of big perds against conservatives
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  there are different raids that are happening
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  but spend a few minutes finishing up what's happening
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  with these poison shots and historically
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  what would you call the moment we're at
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  where there's this full collapse of their narrative
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  and where do you see that going
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  there's a long history of a big pharma
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  and the drug industry in one way shape or form
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  over time getting exposed
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  when it forces bad drugs onto the populace
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  and there tends to be a public rebellion
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  and a public response
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  that then stops it from occurring for generations
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  and protects generations of people
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  and this goes back actually multiple centuries
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  in terms of dealing with the medical establishment
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  and its corruption
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  what is being documented here
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  for people out there if somebody asks you
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  what's the evidence that says that this vaccine
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  is not even a vaccine
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  what is the evidence that this is not safe
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  what is the evidence that this is not effective
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  well the evidence is first of all
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  it's supposed to prevent transmission it didn't
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  it's supposed to prevent infection it didn't
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  that's publicly admitted by Deborah Birx
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  and others so that is no longer
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  significantly in dispute or question
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  or controversy
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  second it's supposed to be
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  if it's supposed to be safe what was supposed to happen
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  is it was supposed to reduce the rate of hospitalization
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  it was supposed to reduce
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  the number of excess deaths
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  instead not only has hospitalizations
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  and in particular excess deaths risen
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  it's risen in direct proportion
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  to when the vaccine
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  is introduced and where it is introduced
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  areas that don't have
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  high vaccination rates have not
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  experienced excess high excess death rates
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  those that have
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  have and that is part of
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  a systematic problem what we've been witnessing
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  live with sports stars
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  and celebrities suddenly having health
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  and even dying right
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  live in front of us around
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  the world is now being confirmed by the data
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  that goes to the second level of data
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  so we have the general excess death data
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  that's being reported and we now have
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  meaningful aspects of that across the globe
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  to give meaningful correlative
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  and potential causative relationships
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  but we now also have
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  actuarial and insurance data
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  from a wide range of western countries
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  that Wall Street has been abuzz about for months
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  that people like Edward Dowd and others
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  have been talking about for months
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  and this now also further affirms
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  and confirms that there is unusual death rate
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  amongst young men
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  in particular that appears to be
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  directly tied and correlated
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  and likely causatively related
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  to the vaccine
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  so we've got the excess death data across
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  jurisdictions we've got the insurance
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  actuarial data both continue
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  to show the exact same pattern
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  that some of us predicted that this vaccine
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  is a deadly vaccine
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  that kills more people than it saves
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  the third level is a wide range
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  of studies and surveys on the lack
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  of safety about this not just from
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  Dr. Malone, Dr. McCullough, Dr.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Corey and others but in
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  as Alex mentioned the New England Journal
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  of Medicine one of the most
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  institutional establishment publications
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  that exist is starting to admit
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  the dangers of this vaccine
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  the British Medical Journal which has been a top
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  this issue now for months
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  broke the whistleblower story
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  about Pfizer, Brooke Jackson in the case
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  I represent her also detailing it
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  additional studies show that from
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  a risk-reward ratio a recent
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  big study that is
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  about to be published shows that
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  for young men in particular and young people
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  in particular the risk to the
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  vaccine outweighs the benefits
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  to it by a ratio as high as a hundred
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  to one so the studies
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  and the data is about to say the mainstream
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  headlines are ninety three to one ninety
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  three times more likely to be hospitalized
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  or died if you have the shot more likely
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  to get it more likely to be hospitalized
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  the opposite of what they said your opinion
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Barnes and forty seconds obviously
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  premeditated what were they thinking
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  they were looking for profits
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  and they had immunity that was that was
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  why they assume they would never be held
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  responsible but if I was corrupt
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  and was going to just put out something to make money
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  I put sugar water out so I didn't hurt people
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  why would they do something like this
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  why would they jump the shark
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  well I think you do have people who
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  want to reduce population I mean what
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  do Bill Gates and these George Soros
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  and the rest of them agree in the great reset agree on
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  they all want the population to be a lot
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  smaller and they've achieved that by what they've
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  done
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  let's shift gears their attempts to take us
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  off the air great ahead with Robert Barnes
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  and four seconds
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  the rage for more than a decade

[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  powders with

[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  to make us vibrant
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  and to defend our immune systems

[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  they have never known
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  the difference is
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  in texas the judge would
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  turn the internet feet off
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  and the cameras would turn it off
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  so we are guilty
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  the judge say
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  so robert barnes is an expert
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  he's worked on this case
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  an independent analyst
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  for info wars
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  he's able to lay this out
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  he's been doing lots of stuff
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  and trying to get us out
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:58.160]  able to lay this out. He's been doing live streaming with literally over a million viewers
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:02.040]  yesterday with his co-hosts, another lawyer out of Canada, laying this out. We've got
[1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:06.800]  a bunch of clips, but just lay out what's really happening here because this is unprecedented.
[1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:10.960]  This judge is sending it all out where she spends hours telling my lawyer, you can't
[1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:14.440]  ask questions about this. You can't ask questions about that. They say they're opening statement.
[1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:18.080]  We want to shut him down and take him off air. He says, well, I want to ask these people,
[1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:22.400]  you know, this FBI, you never said his name. I want to ask, did you talk about taking Alan
[1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:27.600]  Solfair? Nope, you can't ask that question. It's incredible. Explain what's happening.
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:34.000]  Yes. So, uh, Viva Frye and I covered it live yesterday on rumble. Viva's covering it again
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:39.120]  today. I'll be in and out covering it throughout the week. And this, if people want to see a
[1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:45.520]  snapshot of this case, the best snapshot of it is yesterday and Viva and I's coverage of it.
[1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:51.760]  And because here's why. If you had the big lie of this case is that Alex Jones defaulted by not
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:56.800]  participating in discovery. Well, that lie is exposed as a big lie by the plaintiff's own
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:01.680]  arguments and the plaintiff's own evidence, which detail all of the financial information that they
[1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:07.120]  are incorrectly stating throughout the case. They had all the evidence. So that was always a lie.
[1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:11.920]  Second part, they, they admit their whole goal, their whole objective in this trial.
[1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:16.640]  Supposedly a trial just about damages, but they didn't even begin to discuss anything concerning
[1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:21.040]  the plaintiffs until almost two thirds of the way through opening statement. Instead, their whole
[1:08:21.040 --> 1:08:26.080]  thing was bashing Alex Jones. And what did they say to the jury in opening statement? They said
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:32.320]  that the case is about stopping Alex Jones, preventing Alex Jones from ever having a platform
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:38.640]  again, ever having a speakerphone again, ever being that to end the press rights of Alex Jones,
[1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:43.760]  to end the press rights of InfoWars, to end the speech rights of Alex Jones, to end the speech
[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:49.360]  rights of InfoWars. They said so explicitly and expressly as they said, that's what the case was
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:55.920]  all about. And they said, that's what justice is. So, uh, and so, uh, to Norm Pattis's credit,
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:09:00.880]  Norm, if you want to see what good defense advocacy looks like against a rogue judge
[1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:06.480]  in a hostile setting, there is no better example than Norm Pattis's representations yesterday.
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:11.760]  And I recommended watching that, that video in this part of the trial to people all across the
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:16.720]  country, even if they're not interested in this case is particularly because how do you stand up
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:22.400]  to a judge? Alex, Norm Pattis showed how you do so. You don't capitulate to rogue judges. This
[1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:26.800]  judge couldn't even control her temper. So, you got to see a snapshot of that. You got to see how
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:31.360]  one side of the case is, because the judge would sustain objections from the plaintiffs, where
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:36.160]  the plaintiffs didn't even identify what their grounds of objection were. That's how bad it was.
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:40.800]  Well, also, first of all, the former federal, the former federal prosecutor, Democrat Party
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:45.920]  operative, he said, let's take Alex Jones off the air. And then Pattis tries to ask the question
[1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:50.240]  of the FBI. He's never said his name and ask, you know, do you want to take Alex Jones off the
[1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:53.760]  air? And the judge shuts it down and says, you can't ask that question. And Maddie gets up and
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:59.200]  says, nobody's saying take him off the air. We have that clip. I mean, the level of this BS is insane.
[1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:06.160]  Oh, exactly. And what's the one name that is all about what led to this case that this judge says
[1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:10.640]  can't be mentioned, can't be asked about, can't be talked about, can't discuss it in opening statement,
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:13.680]  can't discuss it in direct examination, can't discuss it in cross-examination.
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:18.400]  She ran national TV ads of edited tape of me questioning Sandy, which is my right.
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:22.000]  And I don't apologize for questioning it. I apologize if out of context it hurts somebody's
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:27.600]  feelings. She literally says you will not bring that up that she ran $30 million worth of ads
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:32.960]  in the closing months of the campaign 2016. In fact, as Norm Pattis explained, this whole case
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:37.040]  came about because of Hillary Clinton. And yet Hillary Clinton is the one name that can't be
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:40.720]  talked about, can't ask questions about her, can't mention an opening statement, can't reference her
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:44.480]  to the jury. But she tells Norm he can't talk about anything. She told him yesterday, you've
[1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:50.160]  got to say your client's guilty. I found him guilty. Yeah, no, not only that was already saying that
[1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:52.960]  she's going to try to potentially put you in prison or hold you in contempt. Yes, she said,
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:58.720]  I can't wait till he's here to hold him in contempt. What was that? Yeah, it's about, this is a
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:04.080]  liberal authoritarian power mad approach. And then that that means she's a comes from the
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:08.640]  liberal Republican wing of Connecticut, the Bushite wing of Connecticut. And what you're
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:13.520]  seeing is a judge who couldn't even control her own temper. If a judge is supposed to do one thing,
[1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:18.880]  at least control your temper. She couldn't even control her temper, because she was so enraged,
[1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:24.400]  she couldn't bully Norm Pattis into forfeiting rights. And so all of it. And by the way, the word
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:31.600]  is now, they may not even let me talk. Like I cannot respond in any way. I'm just supposed to sit
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:36.480]  there and let them bully me. Knowing that you have a case supposed to be about damages and yet
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:40.560]  almost none of the evidence presented has anything to do with damages. And they look at their lead
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:46.240]  witness for all these people. Look, the media has covered everybody except their lead plaintiff.
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:50.480]  In the case, who's the lead plaintiff that was the first witness who testified? It was not a parent
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:56.160]  of anybody who died. It's not a sibling of anybody who died at St. Yoke. It's an FBI lawyer,
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:02.080]  an FBI lawyer. He's the one who is their lead number one plaintiff. And what they're doing is
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:06.240]  setting the precedent where the garbage man, I never said his name, I questioned something he
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:10.880]  consumed me. This is bureaucrats setting the precedent to sue people that disagree with them.
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:17.440]  Well, it's beyond that. This is the deep state attempt to establish a basis that if you question
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:22.720]  the deep state, if you question the FBI, if you question the Justice Department, if you question
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:27.760]  the CIA, if you question any government official, what they did, even if you don't talk about them,
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:32.800]  he admitted on the stand, you had never talked about him ever. He had never even in fact,
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:37.920]  he doesn't talk about a single thing he heard you specifically say that supposedly bothered him.
[1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:41.760]  And he had under Connecticut and Texas law, you argued this in the case earlier,
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:45.600]  you were on the case, you can't systemize it and say their name. Since you mentioned it,
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:51.760]  don't believe us, folks. See it for yourself, here it is. Santiago's stuff, those were the calls
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:55.360]  that you were told about, correct? Were your fellow agencies? See it,
[1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:59.200]  Tiago's calls, Hal Big's calls, and multiple. Oh, Hal Big called you too?
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:03.760]  Hal would call the FBI, I didn't speak to him. Okay. How many times did Jones call you?
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:11.680]  He didn't call me, sir. Did you ever see this photograph to 89 on Info Wars?
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:17.360]  I didn't know, sir. Do you know whether he ever talked about you on Info Wars?
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:22.800]  I don't know. If Hal Big appears as a guest on a talk show, does that make him affiliated with
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:28.160]  the talk show? To me it does. Okay, so if I appear on CNN tonight on the CNN affiliate?
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:29.360]  Yes, you are. Okay.
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:40.160]  And when they had the sidebars, he threatened to hold them in contempt for just asking the guy,
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:42.880]  did he ever say your damn name? I don't know who this guy is, Robert.
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:49.120]  Exactly, he admitted that he never saw or heard anything from you or Info Wars about him ever,
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:53.440]  ever, and yet he is being allowed to sue for tens of millions of dollars.
[1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:59.600]  So think about this, folks. This means every FBI agent, every U.S. Justice Department official,
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:05.680]  every CIA official, every State Department official, if you question anything the government did,
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:12.000]  not just what they did, what the government did. That's what they tried in Virginia, remember?
[1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:17.920]  In the Charlottesville case, this is establishing the precedent that the government
[1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:22.480]  officials can now sue you into oblivion if you question their narrative.
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:25.920]  They are a new protected class, never say their name,
[1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:28.560]  never talk about who he is, he wants ten million dollars.
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:35.840]  And here's a high-ranking, well-regarded FBI counsel, right? That's who this guy is,
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:42.080]  this isn't some low-level schmuck, and he is their lead, number one plaintiff testifying
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:48.320]  witness. That tells you what this case is really all about. This case is not about Sandy Hook,
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:52.160]  this case is not even really about the parents and the families, or they would have been the
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:59.040]  first witness up for these lawyers. Instead, it's an FBI lawyer who admits you never even
[1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:03.120]  talked about him, you never even mentioned him, you never even referenced him.
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:05.600]  No, he didn't know who he was until he sued me.
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:12.960]  Exactly. And so this is the goal and two norm patices credit. He finished opening
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:19.280]  statement very well. What Norm said is, first Alex Jones, who's next? That's what the case is
[1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:24.880]  about. Take out Alex Jones, then you can take out anybody else if you question or challenge
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:29.120]  the government's narrative, with the government officials themselves being the one suing,
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:31.840]  even if you never even talked about them ever.
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:36.480]  Stay there. We'll talk more about the case. I've got dozens of clips. We've got to do a special
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:41.760]  show or maybe tomorrow again on these, and there's more today. I mean, this is just crazy. And
[1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:48.080]  the judge reportedly is now telling my lawyers, well, we're gonna admonish Jones and tell him
[1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:52.720]  the few things he can say. And I'll be admonished. And if I say the wrong thing, I'll be put in jail.
[1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:56.000]  If I say I'm innocent, I'll be put in jail. I am innocent.
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:03.200]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic? You've got turbo force,
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:08.080]  you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra, which one is better?
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:16.880]  And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F 150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari?
[1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:22.480]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies. All three are different formulas.
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:29.280]  All three do different things. Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy.
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:34.800]  I can't even take a whole pack myself. Brain force plus is a long term acting clean
[1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:40.800]  new tropic. This brain force ultra is a super fast acting new tropic that
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:46.480]  creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long. They're all three different formulas
[1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:53.760]  and finally back in stock massively discounted brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.

[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:04.240]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year. And I believe the most powerful,
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:12.880]  the man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt, citizen of a republic, the man in the arena.
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:18.320]  There's only 10,000 of this coin and it exists in the world. It will never be made again.
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:24.880]  It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds the information war against the globalist.
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:29.120]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren. This is something you want to own.

[1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:53.840]  world and what message does it send to the new world order robert barnes that despite all their
[1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:58.000]  attacks that we don't decide to give up and we don't decide they're beating us which they're not
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:03.600]  we decide to fight they actually make us bigger if the people see it and take action how big is it
[1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:07.200]  to have the great reset with the number one book in the united states the top 10 of the world
[1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:14.480]  i mean no doubt i mean they thought that the lawsuit by itself along with the platforming
[1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:19.120]  that the lawsuit helped trigger would lead to the end of info wars because they have this
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:25.040]  caricature view of info wars and you and of the audience that misunderstood what the nature of
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:30.080]  the audience was this is why they always had to seek judgment by default as viva fry said yesterday
[1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:36.000]  on his on twitter that what this trial has exposed in connecticut is the same thing the trial in tex
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:42.480]  is exposed as michael cernovich noted which was that even in a liberal jury pool in places like
[1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:49.200]  austin texas and places like liberal democratic connecticut that a honest trial would have resulted
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:54.880]  in you being acquitted of the claims and charges against you in these cases and that's why they
[1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:59.200]  couldn't afford it because the whole truth presents a very different truth than the one
[1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:03.840]  there so that's why i'm telling people i was on uh steven crowded yesterday it's out today
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:08.080]  today and steven's like they really defaulted in his he went and looked it up as well it's true
[1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:12.880]  they said i was guilty but they're putting all my bank numbers twisted all our emails all our
[1:23:12.880 --> 1:23:18.240]  text up but then saying we didn't give them anything yeah i mean you might be the only
[1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:22.720]  media business in the world that manages to have no expenses according to them i mean they they
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:26.880]  take the gross revenues and they assume there's no cost to the product no cost to distribution
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:31.200]  no cost they go you sold 30 million dollars of food yeah and we made seven million and we spent
[1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:37.440]  it all before i mean exactly it's it's all lies oh come on i mean and and they have to do that they
[1:23:37.440 --> 1:23:42.480]  have no choice but to do that because the truth would not set them free the truth would set you
[1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:47.200]  free and that's why we're seeing show trials we're seeing trials where you are not allowed to defend
[1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:52.320]  yourself where a pertinent material relevant questions are being objected to yesterday the
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:59.120]  judge tried to force norm paddus to preview his entire cross examination and he refused and that's
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:03.680]  part of the reason why the judge went nut and for young lawyers out there who want to see what it
[1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:09.040]  how you stand up to a rogue judge you can watch how norm paddus handled yesterday's case and he
[1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:15.120]  did it fearlessly and he did it well and what he exposed on cross examination with that FBI witness
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:20.800]  was someone who's uh emotional tenor suddenly shifted between direct and cross but who basically
[1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:24.800]  revealed he's suing you because other people suggested he sue you i mean that's what it came
[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:30.320]  down to he couldn't really explain how it is he came to sue you in fact instead he brought up the
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:37.040]  lawyer the plaintiff's lawyer's name as where the idea came from he admitted also that he that supposedly
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:42.400]  there are all these threats out there but they don't tie any of those threats to you number one
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:49.520]  number two kind of oddly the FBI never arrested anyone so if there were actually lots of threats
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:54.720]  occurring uh by someone that was actually connected those people guaranteed would have been arrested
[1:24:54.720 --> 1:24:59.280]  and yet no one was arrested suggesting there's something missing in the story framework and
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:03.760]  so what you what people saw yesterday is what this case is really all about it's a political
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:10.240]  hit job by a rogue court unwilling to allow a trial on the merits and so i call it a show trial
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:14.080]  because the trial on the merits is not allowed you're not allowed to defend yourself you're
[1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:19.280]  effectively gagged and robert just like texas they did in closing chris maddie the former federal
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:26.000]  prosecutor left us to operative he did it up front he said take alex jones off the air i mean how
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:33.280]  unamerican is that and why would they be openly admitting it it shows an arrogance oh it shows
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:38.160]  the case is all about you know this case is really not about sandy hook parents this case is about
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:42.800]  political actors this case is about the topic the one person whose name can't be mentioned in court
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:48.640]  hillary clinton this case is about the deep state wanting to establish a new basis to weaponize the
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:53.520]  legal system to take out political dissidents and critics that's what it's about it's about the way
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:26:01.120]  they're on nbc cnn abc msnbc saying this is the template to silence all conservatives and so where
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:08.240]  is red state where is town hall where is national review saying this is wrong exactly all of them
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:13.040]  i mean all of the conservative institutional press anybody that's involved on the legal side
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:18.000]  should be embarrassed and humiliated that they're defending this case i dare any of them to watch
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:22.960]  yesterday's proceeding and call that a fair trial to call that the the beacon of american civil
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:27.920]  justice america's justice system is supposed to be the beacon of justice to the world and right
[1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:32.880]  now it looks like a dystopian nightmare it looks like venezuela i mean i've seen venezuelan show
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:37.920]  trials are fairer than this oh yeah i've seen soviet show trials that at least try to be a
[1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:43.280]  peer fairer than this i i've seen a cuban show trials that at least fair try to be fairer than
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:47.760]  this you have a judge who can't even control her own temper in front of the jury can't even
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:53.920]  control her own ability to show she's not with written house we got what a fair judge does
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:27:00.080]  that's the state that's the gold standard versus this absolutely this is exact this is a nightmare
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:04.720]  if you have a bunch of wokesters and political hacks become judges this is a preview of what
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:10.800]  that world looks like and it's on full display continuous attempts to i mean overt open threats
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:15.360]  that if you defend yourself in court that she's going to hold you in contempt with the implication
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:19.680]  and that that means potential imprisonment or jail yeah let's be clear let's be clear
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:25.920]  you defend your she spends hours saying you can't talk about anything it's crazy do you think the
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:31.920]  jury will see through it uh you never know i mean uh it's in connecticut it's a jury of six
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:36.240]  there's four alternates ten people uh so you never know what a jury's gonna do it's a very
[1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:40.800]  liberal democratic area connecticut uh it's an area that was traumatized and one of the things
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:44.560]  they're trying to do is blame you for everything everybody else did the other thing that came out
[1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:48.800]  in that trial is that all of the evidence of people who believe this we're saying all these
[1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:53.680]  things before you said anything like what they're accusing no one knows who adam lanza is i was
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:58.240]  sitting there with andino and his lawyer and i said you know adam lanza he even my own lawyer
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:05.520]  doesn't know who adam lanza is they know me exactly and so and and norm pass did a good
[1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:11.280]  job of discussing that as well so this is a trez he exposed this trial is not about grief it's not
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:15.760]  about sanny hook it's not even about killing the first amendment we knew they were using
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:19.840]  sanny to get the second but now they're using to kill the first by the way adam lanza shot the

[1:33:52.480 --> 1:34:00.800]  grateful that um we were able to come together as a country at that really terrible time we put aside
[1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:08.000]  differences i wish we could find ways of doing that again we rebuilt new york uh we have done
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:16.800]  our best to take care of the families that lost so much on that terrible day and we have also i
[1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:27.680]  think um been reminded um about how important it is uh to try to deal with extremism of any kind
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:37.760]  especially when it uses violence to try to achieve political and ideological uh goals so i'm one who
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:44.240]  thinks that there are lessons still to be learned from what happened to us on 9 11 that we should be
[1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:51.440]  very aware of uh during this time in our country and the world's history you you mentioned how the
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:56.000]  democrats aren't right on everything and i'm willing to sit down and have conversations about how we
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:03.200]  can move out of this age of stupidity and into an age of reconciliation and reform how do we fix
[1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:08.880]  all of these broken systems some of those answers will come from republicans it's not not the extremist
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:14.560]  that we're dealing with every single day we've got to kill and confront that movement um but that you
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:19.360]  know working with normal mainstream republicans i think that's going to be really really important
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:24.720]  because we have to reform uh these systems and i will tell them too like we got to get the government
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:40.480]  out of our business i'm all in on that you see the doc's decision you see you know in four
[1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:48.160]  people are 9 11 terrorist schumer and others already said it was worse than 9 11 we got congressman
[1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:54.320]  uh congressman tim ryan saying gotta kill the maga movement kill these people roger stone joins us a
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:36:00.560]  little bit in the next hour to talk about the election 55 days out the massive purge the
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:08.880]  hundreds of fbi raids the last few weeks and this incredible intimidation uh that is taking
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:15.040]  place so roger stone our political president joins us here live today on this wednesday edition
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:19.600]  roger thank you so much they are really trying to outlaw their political opposition what do you make
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:28.880]  of this well alex you know as a 40-year observer of american politics elections are always about
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:35.760]  the party in power so in other words this election should be about public safety public health
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:41.920]  most certainly the economy and opportunity about the fact that this administration has
[1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:49.120]  brought us to the brink of world war three in ukraine that we're shipping 51 billion dollars
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:55.280]  before you know it to ukraine when we can't spend the money to seal our own southern border
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:37:01.120]  as well as a free speech these are uh by just the most so they're changing the subject on
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:06.400]  a domestic terrorism that doesn't exist by republicans to make themselves look good as they
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:12.080]  implode the borders destroy the currency drag queen pedophile time launch all these wars cut
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:18.800]  off the power supply my god these people are monsters this is a strategy of diversion in
[1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:26.000]  other words they don't want to talk about gas prices or food shortages or the epic inflation
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:31.520]  that is destroying the buying power the american family no they want to talk about january 6th
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:36.880]  they want to talk about the marlago raid on the president they want to talk about alex jones and
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:43.200]  his trials they want to talk about trump's super PAC and their fundraising practices they want to
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.960]  talk about uh the president's activities in georgia and the fulton county investigation
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:55.600]  they want to talk about seizing cell phones from their political opponents this is a strategy
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:38:03.360]  of of diversion to divert the voters from the issues uh i also think the republicans in all
[1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:10.400]  honesty are doing their very best to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory let me give you that's
[1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:13.520]  the team the republic and that's why you're coming on today thank you for coming on about this
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:18.400]  you're an expert on this the republican leadership is laying down and and not charging forward
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:23.920]  they've got pure victory in their hands i think there's two major mistakes here first of all
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:30.480]  based on the the uh recent u.s supreme court decision uh the question of abortion has been
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:37.680]  shifted properly back to the states there is no need for federal legislation as put forward by
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:43.600]  linsey graham to try to federalize this issue in fact it's totally contrary to what the supreme
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:49.680]  court just said right now it's up to the states to decide whether they want to regulate or even ban
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:57.200]  abortion so again i think linsey graham a classic rhino working with the democrats to make abortion
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:03.760]  sent and front and center in this election when there are and i'm pro life but this has
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:08.560]  just been decided it's a political and let's be honest we're not against linsey graham that he's
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:14.400]  gay the fact that he lives with the staffer the fact is they're blackmailing him and controlling
[1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:18.000]  him with that information that's why we raised that and since you mentioned it took a girl
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:22.400]  said had a lady on last night because i know two people in austin i'm not going to say names
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:27.200]  who were not even in dc who've now been raided or visited by the fb on the last week they don't
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:32.000]  want me to say their names but two people have contacted me that i know well who got visits
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.320]  so they're using this as a dragnet to create fear here's here's Tucker Carlson last night
[1:39:36.320 --> 1:39:41.920]  interviewing trump supporter lisa gallagher about being visited by the fbi here it is lisa gallagher
[1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:46.240]  as we told you a moment ago is one of the many trump supporters who woke up to an fbi raid earlier
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:50.080]  this month and we are grateful that she's willing to join us to tell us about it lisa thank you so
[1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:55.920]  much for coming on so i just want to be clear that you have not committed a crime of any kind i
[1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:59.280]  don't think you've ever been accused of a crime you weren't even at the capital on january 6 i don't
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:03.840]  think you're even in washington tell us how you felt when joe biden's fbi showed up with guns at
[1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:10.080]  your home the morning after his speech i was terrified and i'll be honest with you when my
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:15.760]  daughter woke me up telling me there were three armed fbi officers at my door i thought she was
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:22.400]  joking and i immediately tried to throw clothes on i called my husband i was crying my knees were
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:28.160]  shaking and even though i knew i'd done nothing wrong after saying joe biden's speech the night
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:35.040]  before i thought oh my god this is political and i was frightened i truly thought they can take me
[1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:41.520]  out of here in handcuffs and i thought i'm in my bedroom i thought am i not coming home so i went
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:47.680]  outside and i said gentlemen you're scaring me and they proceeded to tell me that they were given
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:54.080]  an anonymous tip that i was at the capital on january 6 even though of course as we said they
[1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:57.920]  knew you weren't because they had facial recognition software and there's no evidence and it's almost
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:02.480]  two years good do you know who this anonymous tip this snitch who turned you into federal law
[1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:09.120]  enforcement for supporting trump on facebook might be no i know nothing and i invited them into my
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:15.600]  home so i could look at my phone and my calendar and i have subsequently called the fbi office in
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:23.760]  newark to just document or know for sure that it really was fbi agents at my home and it was
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:27.760]  and they said it was an anonymous tip but they won't tell me anything else
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:32.240]  yeah because they're not enough law enforcement concerns right now with 107
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:37.040]  thousand americans dying of fentanyl last year lisa galler i know it takes bravery to come on
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:41.280]  and explain what happened to you i think only when people do that will it end
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:44.800]  and so i'm doubly grateful that you did this for us tonight thank you so much
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:48.880]  so ronnie we're going to break you'll be with us 30 minutes the next hour but i'm not a liberty
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:53.680]  sakes people ask me not to but let's just say this people personally intimate that give me services
[1:41:54.640 --> 1:42:00.720]  they didn't tell my medical doctor wasn't in dc didn't even go they swat team them so
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:03.920]  this is next level roger this is pure intimidation
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:10.960]  yeah there's no question about it alex and i can understand how this lady feels i mean i wasn't
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:16.720]  on the capital i didn't go to the ellipse i know nothing about the electoral college delay yet i
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:22.240]  continue to be assaulted by the january sixth committee with a narrative of disinformation
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:27.600]  it is it's chilling i think that's the purpose of it well i mean but we know about hundreds of
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:34.560]  new fp iraids and i'm getting calls must be thousands of this is like full on uh look i'm
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:38.720]  going to operate on the assumption that uh the government's already seen all my emails and texts
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:43.440]  and i have no involvement on january sixth let's come back to it on the other side but
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:50.160]  this is an effort to demonize the opposition uh in advance of an election that's exactly what it is
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:54.800]  to outlaw your political opposition roger stone will handicap the election in 55 days

[1:46:56.720 --> 1:47:20.560]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:49.200]  there are multinational corporations around all these third world slave countries
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:52.560]  they're absolutely used to being able to use humans as worse than garbage
[1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:57.840]  and they bought off the democratic party they bought off most of the republican leadership
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:01.360]  and they're making their move on europe and america and australia and new zealand
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:04.640]  and once these countries fall they believe they're gonna have global dominance
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:13.280]  to do whatever they want but whether it's sweden or whether it is brazil or whether it's idly
[1:48:13.280 --> 1:48:18.480]  or canada conservative leaders are winning major elections and presidencies and prime
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:24.000]  ministerships so the system is panicked the self-annoying globalist and if they get identified
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:29.280]  it's game over that's why they're trying to outlaw their political opposition roger stone
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:33.200]  you're one of the leading experts they fear you so much because you help get trump elections
[1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:36.720]  you're instrumental in it let's let's get into the waterfront here i'm trying to give you the floor
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:44.320]  one of the things that's disturbing me right now alex are the actions of peter teal for those
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:50.320]  of you don't know peter teal is a billionaire was a major financier of donald trump's candidacy
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:57.600]  and he stepped forward essentially to underwrite at tens of millions of dollars the endorsements of
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:05.200]  jd vance for the us senate in ohio and blake masters and mass in arizona both candidates
[1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:12.240]  i might add that i very strongly support both of them america first candidates but having financed
[1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:18.320]  their nominations mr teal is now declining to finance their general election efforts
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:24.240]  and both of them are behind their opponents slightly uh and behind their opponents in fundraising
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:31.840]  mr teal comes forward and says well the republican party has not defined enough of a positive image
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:39.040]  a positive program for this election alex all elections are about the incumbent party about
[1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:44.800]  the job that is being done by congressional democrats in combination with the biden
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:51.600]  white house uh and and this is deeply disturbing now mr teal has an interesting background uh he is
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:57.120]  an it genius he invented the palatial program which he sold to the government this is the
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:03.440]  program the government uses to monitor us citizens uh he calls himself a libertarian i will take
[1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:11.600]  that at face value but now having gotten these candidates nominated in crucial us senate races
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:18.800]  he needs to step up to the plate as opposed to walking out on the party please continue just
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:26.320]  give us your analysis that's what i want of the 2022 midterms and then secondarily you have uh
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:33.760]  kevin mccarthy uh who kind of following in the footsteps of newt gingrich has put forward a
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:41.440]  proposal uh that is uh kind of reminiscent of the contract for america the problem with this is
[1:50:42.400 --> 1:50:49.040]  that in order to have a policy statement brought enough for every republican to support
[1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:55.360]  all one needs to do is to look at the flip side of the biden administration in other words
[1:50:55.360 --> 1:51:03.280]  uh i disagree with putting forward pale pastels we need to have a bold policy but it's easily defined
[1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:11.760]  as being the direct opposite of that which the democrats are for so for example uh kevin mccarthy
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:18.560]  will not say today that if the house republicans take control that he would move articles of
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:27.520]  impeachment against joe biden there's certainly more evidence uh to justify an impeachment charge
[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:36.160]  against joe biden than there ever was against john trump 10 to the big guy there it is right there
[1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:43.680]  that's more than enough uh to uh spark an impart an impeachment uh charge whether or not you have
[1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:50.960]  the votes in the senate to pass that which would be a two-thirds vote by the way is immaterial this
[1:51:50.960 --> 1:51:57.360]  is about making a political statement and taking a stand in in laying out for the voters what the
[1:51:57.360 --> 1:52:04.400]  stakes are in this election the republicans are just not aggressive enough uh and uh they cannot
[1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:11.840]  let the narrative be hijacked this cannot be about the marlago raid and president donald trump
[1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:17.920]  cannot be about the alex jones trials it cannot be about the investigation into trump's super PAC
[1:52:17.920 --> 1:52:24.880]  cannot be about folson county georgia cannot be about sizing seizing the cell phones of of
[1:52:24.880 --> 1:52:31.680]  these trump supporters cannot be about january 6 it must be about their stewardship of the country
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:35.040]  well that's why i said republicans even though i have the votes should do an impeachment like
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:39.040]  democrats did to expose biden in the new world order and take control of the narrative but they
[1:52:39.040 --> 1:52:46.160]  don't do that that's that is precisely the problem that's why i have urged people uh not to give to
[1:52:46.160 --> 1:52:51.120]  the republican national committee not to give to the republican senatorial committee or to the
[1:52:51.120 --> 1:52:57.840]  house committee right now uh people out there who want to see a change need to support individual
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:03.600]  america first candidates directly instead of supporting the party organization i want to shift
[1:53:03.600 --> 1:53:09.360]  gears in the next hour i want to talk about all these clips i've got we have biden saying
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:14.800]  he killed inflation he's proud of it kamala harris saying the border is secure where are they going
[1:53:14.800 --> 1:53:18.640]  with gaslighting but the few minutes we have left to break four minutes left to break roger stone
[1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:25.600]  trump we know he told a lot of people including you and mg mtg in early july he was set to
[1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:28.800]  announce and he said well i'm gonna run but i'm not gonna announce when well that's an
[1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:33.120]  announcement to run then they created all this law fair and all these fake criminal charges
[1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:37.200]  try to go after him what is the inside baseball currently on trump running
[1:53:37.200 --> 1:53:43.920]  and is the announcement intimate or what's unfolding alex the only thing that's predictable
[1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:50.000]  about donald j trump is that he's entirely unpredictable in a certain sense the assault
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:56.880]  on his home in marlago has galvanized his support so that i don't think a an immediate
[1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:05.200]  announcement of candidacy is either you know in the offing or necessarily desirable first of all
[1:54:05.200 --> 1:54:12.160]  it would create substantial legal issues in terms of the use of funds he has on hand today
[1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:18.880]  in his various backs millions of dollars that may not be able to be used in this election then
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:27.120]  secondarily if the party falls short through no fault of his well then he within the structure
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:33.200]  of the party would be blamed for diverting attention and money from republican candidates
[1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:38.240]  now i happen to believe that governor ron desantis the governor florida my governor
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:44.720]  intends to announce his candidacy literally immediately after the election and i think
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:50.160]  the president remain needs to remain mindful of that i still think it is more likely than not
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:53.600]  that he will be a candidate i just heard a record skipping noise we're going to put this on the
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:58.880]  front of the interview once it's posted to band of idio roger stone is rarely wrong about his
[1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:05.360]  political analysis you're saying you're inside baseball or is that just your opinion the sanis
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:11.920]  will announce after the midterms in 56 days that is uh that's hard intelligence alex that's not
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:17.920]  just my instinct that's hard intelligence and by the way as president donald trump has said
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:24.160]  ron desantis has the right to do that it's his prerogative to run if he wishes to run
[1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:28.240]  i still believe that there is no poll that shows that donald trump would not beat him
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:32.720]  by at least one of my sources is saying they've got a secret agreement to run together
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:40.320]  uh the electoral college prevents that you cannot go from florida correct you cannot
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:45.360]  have a president and a vice president from the same state because if you do you would forfeit
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:51.440]  the electoral votes of florida's 27 votes uh that's too precious for us to do but couldn't
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:56.080]  trump just swing back saying he lives in new york again do you think he wants to pay new york
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:03.200]  state income taxes i think not or you're saying now he lives in new jersey or virginia do you
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:08.640]  think he wants to spend uh pay new jersey income taxes i think not no at this point
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:15.760]  they're both floridians and i don't think that can be changed again um much has happened since
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:20.320]  that fourth of july when we were both speculating that he may become a candidate which by the way
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:28.240]  i thought was a very real possibility uh at the time that we predicted it but again said trump
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:34.960]  constantly changes his mind well he he retains tactical flexibility is the way that i would put
[1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:41.040]  it i still think he intends to run i think he's highly likely to run i still think he's our strongest
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:47.520]  candidate but as to exactly when well that that situation has been our roger stay there i want
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:51.920]  to get into these clips i mentioned and i want to get into the democrats saying republicans are all
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:56.400]  about the state's terror attacks with no evidence of it and then saying we've got to outlaw the
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:57:00.320]  republican party how do we deal with that and clearly i think they're going to stage a false
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:05.680]  flag when you say my enemies are terrorists there's no evidence they are well clearly like the you
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:10.000]  know the situation in michigan with the fake kidnapping of the governor or january 6 clearly
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:14.960]  they're priming the pump getting ready people are ready for a major stage event roger stone is our

[1:59:54.800 --> 2:00:07.520]  alex jones all right roger stone's going to talk about the economy the russia war and so much more
[2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:12.400]  in the next 30 minutes but right now i was talking to her the break he wants to get into this
[2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:20.640]  weaponization declaring their political opposition to be terrorist and how they're trying to have this
[2:00:20.640 --> 2:00:26.240]  process of diversion to change the subject from how they wreck society on to how their opposition
[2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:30.480]  are domestic terrorists and of course you were bringing up the sandy hook thing and what they're
[2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:37.200]  doing there yeah alex i think this is real this election should be about joe biden this election
[2:00:37.200 --> 2:00:43.040]  should be about his stewardship of the country it should be about gas prices it should be about
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:48.560]  inflation it should be about food shortages it would have been should be about this disastrous
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:55.440]  foreign policy should be about sealing the southern border should be about the the the drug
[2:00:55.440 --> 2:01:02.000]  epidemic in this country the fentanyl epidemic instead the democrats seek to make the selection
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:07.920]  about donald trump so to the extent that the attacks on steve bannon the attacks on you
[2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:16.400]  the attacks regarding january 6 the attacks in folton county the the seizing of cell phones
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:23.200]  of patriots like mike lindell this is all a strategy of diversion they need to they seek
[2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:29.600]  to make this about the opposition as opposed to making about their stewardship of the country
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:36.400]  we cannot from a message point of view allow that to happen we are at an enormous disadvantage
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:42.880]  because for the first time in our history we have the full and complete censorship and control
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:49.760]  of all mass communications this is why info wars is so important because info wars like frank
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:57.840]  speech dot com like tucker carlson like a number of other specific outlets is a beacon of truth
[2:01:57.840 --> 2:02:06.720]  uh in this in this morass otherwise what you have is a democrat media cabal that is intent on
[2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:12.880]  diverting the american people from the real issues in this election uh and you have a non-combative
[2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:19.680]  republican party including members like lindsey graham who i think are are distracting from our
[2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:26.240]  message with a federal abortion bill that is completely unnecessary at this point uh in in
[2:02:26.240 --> 2:02:32.080]  the wake of the new supreme court decision so um you know i look i'm a strategist i've been a
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:37.360]  strategist for 40 years i look at problems political problems strategically and i seek to
[2:02:37.360 --> 2:02:45.280]  come up with an answer this may seem uh quaint to some but in all honesty at this point praying
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:52.480]  is a major part of my strategy in other words i really i'm waiting for divine intervention here
[2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:58.080]  i am for washington said that i know it's true petition god at this point we're up against
[2:02:58.080 --> 2:03:05.680]  such evil we must petition god it's a vital part of our strategy because at this juncture the attacks
[2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:13.520]  are so broad their power is so awesome uh they're ignoring of traditional norms and rules political
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:18.720]  investigations just before an election generally speaking are out of bounds at the department
[2:03:18.720 --> 2:03:26.640]  of justice it has always been thus but that is not the case now and therefore yes uh i am praying
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:32.720]  fervently for success in this fall's elections in order to change the trajectory of the country
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:37.600]  when you look at the democrats all the polls show they're in complete trouble but
[2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:40.560]  they've got push polls out that though they're not as behind as we thought
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:45.280]  we're obviously going to see a big repeat in 55 days what we saw two years ago
[2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:52.880]  look there there is polling and there is polling uh and not all polls are equal the methodology the
[2:03:52.880 --> 2:03:58.160]  sample size uh the who commissioned the poll these things are all you ask the question
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:04.960]  the the way you ask the question the order you ask the questions in all of these can affect
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:11.280]  the outcome anyway you slice it the backdrop for the democrats in this election is not
[2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:17.920]  favorable therefore they can only win if they can divert public attention from their record
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:24.720]  i mean i don't know how much clearer this can be they don't want to talk about gas prices
[2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:30.880]  they don't want to talk about shipping 51 billion dollars to ukraine they don't want to talk about
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:36.800]  the the fentanyl epidemic in this country they don't want to talk about rising crime and public
[2:04:36.800 --> 2:04:42.480]  safety which is an issue in now in every state in the country so we can't let them divert us
[2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:46.560]  without their attacking it's like me most people would cover a trial against them all day now we
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:50.080]  we spend a little bit of time on it because the big issues are what important we can't let them
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:59.840]  distract us roger stone stay there back in 60 seconds people ask me all the time what is your
[2:04:59.840 --> 2:05:05.920]  best new tropic you've got turbo force you've got brain force plus and you've got brain force
[2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:14.240]  soldier which one is better and that's like asking what's better a four death 150 or a catalac
[2:05:14.800 --> 2:05:21.920]  or a Ferrari it's different strokes for different folks it varies all three different formulas
[2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:29.280]  all three do different things turbo force is 10 hours of clean out of control energy i can't even
[2:05:29.280 --> 2:05:36.320]  take a whole pack myself brain force plus is a long-term acting clean new tropic this brain force
[2:05:36.320 --> 2:05:43.520]  ultra is a super fast acting new tropic that creates incredible clarity but doesn't last very
[2:05:43.520 --> 2:05:49.200]  long they're all three different formulas and finally back in stock massively discounted brain
[2:05:49.200 --> 2:06:00.160]  force ultra is available at infowarstore.com brain force ultra back in stock infowarstore.com
[2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:07.440]  of the information war it's alex jones
[2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:18.720]  all right so the gas lighting has reached insane levels you've got Kamala Harris
[2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:24.240]  who I've convinced is on a bunch of zanets and she's bombed out of her brain we know Pelosi's
[2:06:24.240 --> 2:06:30.000]  drunk her husband's drunk Kamala can tell us on pills and she's up there saying the border is
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:37.040]  completely secure and then Biden's like we beat inflation that was yesterday last week he said
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:41.600]  we beat big pharma you mean you're totally controlled by big pharma so let's play
[2:06:41.600 --> 2:06:46.720]  biden on inflation the Kamala Harris back-to-back and yet former top trump advisor roger's gonna
[2:06:46.720 --> 2:06:53.440]  take on it stood up okay you're listening there to president biden at the white house he's
[2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:57.840]  celebrating the passage of the inflation reduction act he says that he's been fighting big pharma for
[2:06:57.840 --> 2:07:03.120]  decades um but there is this unfortunate split screen right now with the dow taking a total
[2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:10.080]  beating down more than 1200 points and so it feels like it's hard to be celebratory for some people
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:14.160]  in the crowd yeah too many people cross this border for the first time ever you're confident this
[2:07:14.160 --> 2:07:24.800]  border is secure we have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation including
[2:07:24.800 --> 2:07:32.000]  ours in our administration but there are still a lot of problems that we are trying to fix
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:38.960]  given the deterioration that happened over the last four years we also have to put in place
[2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:47.920]  a a a a law and a plan for a pathway for citizenship so they've started world war
[2:07:47.920 --> 2:07:53.040]  through the russians they're all on drugs roger when you watch these type of clips it was one thing
[2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:57.760]  if they haven't ever once while it's every day it's a clown show where do you see this going
[2:07:57.760 --> 2:08:05.120]  yeah the problem for the democrats is that none of that rings true with the actual voters in other
[2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:10.720]  words voters know that it's unsafe to go in the streets voters know we have a crime and drug
[2:08:10.720 --> 2:08:18.240]  epidemic voters know that our southern border is not secure at the same time no voters has any
[2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:25.120]  confidence that ultra trillion dollar spending bills are going to solve the inflation issue in
[2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:32.320]  fact if anything they are going to ignite the inflation problem further so there's a credibility
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:38.560]  gap between what the democrats say and between and what the voters actually feel well sure i mean
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:43.840]  let me interrupt you how can kamala harris is not the first time say the border is secure i mean i
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:48.640]  mean i mean i mean that's like saying the atlantic ocean doesn't have water in it it's our blue
[2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:55.440]  birds aren't blue or you know i mean it's just it's ridiculous what is this no what's ridiculous is
[2:08:55.440 --> 2:09:02.960]  that she says that and that the meet the press uh talking head questioning her doesn't question it
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:10.240]  doesn't challenge her just let's sit let's her say it as if it is a fact uh there's your real
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:20.400]  problem which is we have a corporate media democrat cabal uh and together they weaponize
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:26.400]  their narrative but you notice there's no challenge nobody says to joe biden but wait how
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:32.240]  will spending trillions spending and borrowing trillions more solve the inflation problem nobody
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:36.960]  asks no that's like saying how will ejecting heroin give me a cure from heroin addiction
[2:09:36.960 --> 2:09:42.240]  or how will drinking jack daniel's cure me of alcoholism or how will eating 55 twinkies make
[2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:48.400]  me lose weight i mean it's just it's oxymoronic and i think the voters are smart enough to
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:54.320]  know that that's why i still believe that the the fundamentals the underpinnings for republican
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:10:00.880]  victory and a change in direction of the country is still there unless they can utilize the mass
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:07.840]  media to raise these other issues and to make us republicans conservative and those issues
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:16.240]  are january 6 the alexio show trial what else are they a trump uh steve bannon's uh arrest
[2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:22.480]  60 days before an election just like his previous charges 60 days before an election the uh
[2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:29.920]  investigation into into donald trump's super PAC so follow this through because the the president
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:35.040]  raised money around the question of election integrity which he has a first amendment right
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:42.160]  to do the democrats considered charging him with mail fraud because they say that's disinformation
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:46.400]  when i would argue it is uh well within his first amendment rights and it's certainly an
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:53.360]  arguable issue well sure we have the press secretary uh six years ago trying to unseat
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:57.920]  trump saying have alternate electors she gets confronted and says well that's different no
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:03.920]  if it's not different i mean it's just it's all ridiculous no that's exactly true in 2016
[2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:10.800]  hillary clinton uh enter campaign manager john pedesta sought a delay or even a cancellation
[2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:15.760]  the certification of the electoral college vote they actually want to make a presentation to the
[2:11:15.760 --> 2:11:22.640]  electoral college regarding non-existent russian collusion uh but they also have one other large
[2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:28.720]  problem here alex and that is nobody on the democratic side wants any attention to the
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:36.640]  results of of hunter biden's laptop here's evidence of epic corruption uh and in fact treason
[2:11:36.640 --> 2:11:41.040]  where the interests of foreign nations were put ahead of the interests of our nation
[2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:46.640]  well i'm gonna correct you it's not epic it's unprecedented corruption i work for chinese spies
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:51.200]  he says that the head of chinese intelligence controls me i've been told to do in a month
[2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:55.680]  my dad doesn't know what to do we're under chinese command i mean there's freaking audio
[2:11:55.680 --> 2:12:01.280]  they admit it's his that he's a chinese agent under chinese communist spy chief control
[2:12:02.480 --> 2:12:08.800]  this is one of the reasons why robert dobby's new movie my son hunter uh which bright part
[2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:14.320]  has made available which i watched last night absolutely stunning alex i mean it tells the
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:22.480]  story in a very very compelling and historically accurate way so you know this art imitates life
[2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:28.240]  in this particular case this is an issue the democrats do not want to talk about we got
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:31.920]  one more segment when you've got four minutes to break but let me ask you big picture i go back
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:37.120]  to false flags i'm not a rocket scientist but i'm also not stupid when you've got hillary and
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:42.000]  democrat party members like tim ryan yesterday they're everywhere saying republicans are terrorists
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:46.320]  they're gonna blow stuff up republicans are illegal they're the biggest terror group it's imminent
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:51.440]  they're gonna get us there i mean we saw the whitmer stage the tag we saw the january 6th
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:56.000]  provocateur it's not even two plus two equals four it's the number one is the number one
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:00.560]  they're obviously provocaturing or planning something with 55 days out your take on that
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:07.040]  and how do we counter it uh you know as i have said here on the show and in other places i still
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:14.400]  yet uh fear some other kind of manufactured health crisis some kind of additional pandemic
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:19.120]  that we predicted that six months ago and they tried monkeypox it didn't work but you're right
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:25.840]  they already tried it does not appear to work but uh you know in in politics a week is a lifetime
[2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:33.920]  this election is still months away and they still have time to use the cdc to use the fda to use the
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:40.640]  mechanism of public health uh to create some new stare this is a very deep concern of mine
[2:13:40.640 --> 2:13:46.400]  so you're more worried about a new bio thread what about russia i mean that is on right i mean
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:51.360]  major offensives russia's being pushed back russia threatening nuclear war this is out of control
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:57.920]  uh it's very very hard of course with all of the war propaganda to know what is really
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:02.160]  happening in that part of the world no i agree with you but the russians have said you crossed a
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:08.560]  red line now it's war i've got intel sources us troops are there nato and they are with high tech
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:14.000]  weapons they are pushing the russians back i'm praying against the beginning of world war three
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:18.320]  i really think that they have pushed us right to the precipice and if if the reports are true
[2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:25.200]  that the ukranians uh and more precisely nato are using sophisticated weaponry supplied by the
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:31.680]  united states how far will they push putin before we have a world war uh believe me every american
[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:36.720]  needs to be praying about this even as we speak there's an example they admit they pumped in
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:42.560]  200 000 switchblade drones that you can carry three up on your back it's u.s satellite controlled
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:47.520]  you just launch it it goes and flies around for hours and loyters with a pound of explosives in
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:53.520]  its nose and goes and kills personnel and equipment i mean i mean i mean the russians are getting
[2:14:53.520 --> 2:15:00.160]  their ass handed to them and they keep fighting 20 dead generals word is a something like 80 000
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:05.520]  dead russians and now now russia says okay we're getting ready to use nukes i mean it's just getting
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:09.760]  the russians for the first time are targeting civilians and blowing up power plants roger so
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:16.320]  i'm not on either side this is insane but this is escalating very quickly uh again this is what
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:22.400]  the election should be about it should not be about you know my dream should be let's stop world war
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:30.400]  dammit i mean you know but the average liberal just loves war now roger everything is reversed
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:36.320]  everything is extraordinarily reversed uh they are now gung-ho for war uh and this administration
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:42.640]  is trying to sleepwalk us into one uh it is it's extremely vexing and again prayer is the greatest
[2:15:42.640 --> 2:15:46.560]  antidote at this juncture all right i'm gonna spring something on roger because i know he talks
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:50.400]  trip all the time he doesn't brag about it he prepped listens to him and he listened on this
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:54.880]  show as well what is roger stone's advice to president trump because we could get him on our

[2:20:01.840 --> 2:20:16.160]  order it's alex jones we live in a time where the president of the odd states had a major election
[2:20:16.160 --> 2:20:24.560]  stolen from him and it's saying he has a weaponized deep state rogue government attacking him
[2:20:24.560 --> 2:20:30.080]  that stole the election it's all true roger stone i know trump's not perfect but he was the real
[2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:34.880]  president he stood up for america he made mistakes but the globalist hating because
[2:20:34.880 --> 2:20:40.640]  he really was for america and really was being the president what is your advice to trump and
[2:20:40.640 --> 2:20:46.000]  then in closing your advice the millions of people tuned in right now about what they can do to make
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:51.360]  sure the deep state doesn't fully collapse and take over this country well first of all i think
[2:20:51.360 --> 2:20:58.560]  the president needs really first rate legal representation he needs to take this assault
[2:20:58.560 --> 2:21:06.080]  on him legally serious i mean yes it is unprecedented but the irony if you just stop and think about
[2:21:06.080 --> 2:21:13.440]  this for a moment is they they are assaulting his reputation and they are assaulting him legally
[2:21:13.440 --> 2:21:21.040]  over his retention of documents about which we know nothing in other words there's so much
[2:21:21.040 --> 2:21:27.120]  disinformation the documents were classified the documents were not classified the documents were
[2:21:27.120 --> 2:21:34.160]  declassified the documents were not declassified unlike the russian collusion hoax which by the way
[2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:41.280]  continues to collapse in the courts where john durham i think is going to reveal even more shortly
[2:21:41.280 --> 2:21:48.160]  about the origins of the russian collusion hoax in the original susman trial despite the fact that
[2:21:48.160 --> 2:21:55.600]  susman a low-level clinton operative was not convicted it still laid bare on the public record
[2:21:55.600 --> 2:22:01.200]  the deep involvement hillary clinton herself and oliver henchman in the dirty tricks operation
[2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:08.320]  that laid the foundations for the russian collusion hoax then yesterday we learned that the russian
[2:22:08.320 --> 2:22:17.440]  ivord in shanko who was in fact the source of the of the steel dossier was on the payroll of the fbi
[2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:23.040]  at the time he was doing the work that this is really extraordinary but you will notice the
[2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:30.640]  mainstream media coverage of this today is virtually non-existent and since you mentioned
[2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:36.240]  that that was my next question durham shocker the shanko was paid fb on formant while he made all
[2:22:36.240 --> 2:22:42.240]  that up was paid to lie summer sharing this durham strategy was to mop up with the fbi
[2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:47.120]  make it seem like the agency got duped but now the documents in court show that he was working
[2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:54.480]  for him the whole time well not only that but yesterday it was revealed that lisa page remember
[2:22:54.480 --> 2:23:02.400]  her the fbi agent she wrote talking points for fbi director james comey so that when comey went to
[2:23:02.400 --> 2:23:08.400]  the super secret intelligence committees for briefings he completely misled them about the
[2:23:08.400 --> 2:23:15.520]  origins of the steel dossier those bodies then morphed into both the house in senate
[2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:21.120]  intelligence committee investigations into donald trump on the basis of information that they knew
[2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:27.040]  was not reliable that they knew had been fabricated that they knew had been paid for by hillary
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:35.520]  clinton yet to this day no one has paid any price not fbi director james comey not cia director
[2:23:36.320 --> 2:23:42.880]  john brennan not deputy director andrew mccabe he actually got his pension back after getting caught
[2:23:42.880 --> 2:23:50.960]  lying to the fbi and being fired mr durham continues to charge lowest level operatives as
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:56.800]  opposed to going to the part of the beast and as i'm sure you saw alex you had hillary clinton back
[2:23:56.800 --> 2:24:04.000]  on the scene lying again saying well none of the documents that i had on my illegal mail server
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:10.800]  were classified when in fact we know that many of them were classified but there there was no
[2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:17.840]  raid on her home in chapaqua there was no raid on her compound so again you have the two-tiered
[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:26.000]  justice system uh and you have a a mainstream media that is dedicated to demonizing us uh while
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:33.360]  giving them essentially a pass and then we see incredible contradictions by the left constantly
[2:24:33.360 --> 2:24:41.600]  and their own people don't call them here is sink ugert of the young turds and uh this is him in
[2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:52.080]  january or excuse me june 25th of 2020 the young turks individual says i'm done i'm now supporting
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:56.160]  hashtag defund the police hundred percent i already largely agree with the substance of the argument
[2:24:56.160 --> 2:25:02.160]  and now i'm down for framing too there's no reform or transformation that can fix this
[2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:05.840]  we have to start over and completely rebuild policing in this country controlled by leftist
[2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:14.160]  now here he is september 13th yesterday will people who came up with defund the police slogan
[2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:19.360]  admit they were wrong it was wildly counterproductive framing you don't speak for the left and neither
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:24.960]  do people pushing the counterproductive abolish the prisons whole show that almost no one on the
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:30.320]  left agrees with it so he's a big part of pushing it when he's not talking about how he loves having
[2:25:30.320 --> 2:25:37.440]  sex with animals literally folks it's drooling on air about pleasuring uh donkeys and then he
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:43.440]  shifts gears 180 and says how dare you defund the police just like biden's done they think we have no
[2:25:43.440 --> 2:25:50.320]  memory roger stone yeah look i don't really care what chunk yogurt said as you will remember
[2:25:50.320 --> 2:25:56.160]  we had an epic confrontation with him at the 2016 republican national convention when he invited us
[2:25:56.160 --> 2:26:03.280]  on his set and then when we came on his set tried to say that we were crashing his set a kind of a
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:08.400]  staged drama i mean i remember the the woman producer they invited us over and we said we
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:12.720]  gotta do another interview we'll be back and and they said oh we broke into a set it was an open
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:19.840]  area yeah it was it was a classic for those of you can't see it we should pull that video up uh it
[2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:25.760]  was there we go and and absurdity they invited us on the set then they said they were crashing we
[2:26:25.760 --> 2:26:33.680]  were crashing the set uh completely and totally ridiculous but that was fun wasn't it it was fun
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:39.280]  it's the last time we had fun it's been all downhill since then roger in closing what do you
[2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:44.880]  predict for america what's your gut level tell you pretty dire understand let's just pray well i mean
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:52.080]  in politics a week is a lifetime uh roe v wade was front and central central in the front and center
[2:26:52.080 --> 2:26:59.520]  in the political debate it was wiped off the front pages by the raid at marlago uh it's hard to say
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:04.000]  what will happen but i'm not going to make a prediction about an election that is still many
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:09.440]  weeks off again the fundamental backdrop is still there for the republicans to win if they can
[2:27:09.440 --> 2:27:16.320]  remain focused on an attack on the record of the incumbent and their performance uh uh in their
[2:27:16.320 --> 2:27:22.960]  stewardship of the country but if voters get diverted to all these other issues well then i do
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:27.920]  think we can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory no i agree but that's all you see republics
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:32.080]  including you and i we do it too you know we're guilty we say don't we do it we're not russian
[2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:37.040]  agents we're not terrorists we're not this i mean you still gotta respond to at the same time it should
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:42.240]  be inflation it should be open borders it should be fentanyl it should be the russia war i mean
[2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:49.600]  that's where we should be i agree in the meantime everybody needs to join us in prayer i just do
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:55.200]  not believe the lord is going to let every great thing that he has uh that he has created be destroyed
[2:27:55.200 --> 2:28:00.720]  and i believe in the end victory will therefore be ours that's right how do people get a roger stone

[2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:23.040]  well tucker carlson came out and pointed out the newer times suppressed that my book
[2:33:23.040 --> 2:33:27.920]  the great reset the war of the world is number one that's just the next level censorship and
[2:33:27.920 --> 2:33:31.680]  mark dies weighed in on it that i'm in a bunch of other news items on the other side of this stay
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:36.880]  with us alex jones the most banned man in america has a brand new book out called the great reset
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:42.400]  and the war for the world which surprisingly hasn't been banned from amazon or bars of noble
[2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:48.720]  instead everyone is just pretending that the book doesn't exist and the new york times is censoring
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:53.200]  it from their bestseller list in the publishing world there's a company called book scan which is
[2:33:53.200 --> 2:33:57.440]  owned in part by the neilson company you're probably familiar with the neilson television
[2:33:57.440 --> 2:34:03.440]  ratings so they also track the sales of books and all bestseller lists use the book scan list
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:08.400]  to determine which books should be on the bestseller list any given week and according to the
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:12.640]  book scan figures again the industry standard this book should have been up at the top of the
[2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:18.400]  new york times bestseller list because well it sold more copies than anyone else during the first
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:23.120]  week once it was released the great reset if you're not familiar with it is basically the globalist
[2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:30.480]  plan to use the coveted lockdowns to finalize the socialist new world order under the disguise of
[2:34:30.480 --> 2:34:35.440]  an economic recovery plan it involves so much more like implementing the surveillance state like
[2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:40.880]  something out of orwell's 1984 or the old 90s movie demotion man starring westley snipes and
[2:34:40.880 --> 2:34:46.320]  sylvester Stallone a cashless society and promoting transhumanism as the new global
[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:52.480]  luciferian religion promising people supposed a turn of life if they'll just plug into the matrix
[2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:57.120]  now alex's book made it out to other bestseller lists in the industry like the usa today the
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:02.720]  wall street journal publisher weekly but it's mysteriously missing from the supposed most
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:08.320]  prestigious bestseller list in the country over at the new york times because it's not a bestseller
[2:35:08.320 --> 2:35:14.720]  list it's a manually curated list often it's just an editor's choice list or a recommended reading
[2:35:14.720 --> 2:35:20.240]  list and they certainly don't want to recommend that people read alex's book or especially award
[2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:25.680]  him with the prestigious title of a new york times bestseller now this is not new the new york
[2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:31.120]  times has done this many times before for many years earlier this year they kept the book about
[2:35:31.120 --> 2:35:36.720]  george soros off the top 10 list the man behind the curtain inside the secret network of george
[2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:42.800]  soros by matt palumbo they've done this to ted cruz to bill o'reilly to janeen pierrow another
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:48.560]  fox news host who had a book come out at the same time as stormy daniels remember that floozy
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:52.400]  she had a book come out that sold just a few thousand copies but of course the new york times
[2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:59.040]  put her on the bestseller list in 2019 when jim acosta tried to cash in on his trumpeting book
[2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:05.280]  he didn't even break the top 50 on the amazon bestseller list which is an authentic algorithm driven
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:12.560]  sales rank and dropped off the amazon top 100 after just two days but of course he was added
[2:36:12.560 --> 2:36:18.400]  inserted artificially into the new york times bestseller list as well hey jim how come your book
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:23.840]  didn't make it above the top 50 on amazon's bestseller list it fell off the amazon top 100
[2:36:23.840 --> 2:36:28.560]  list after two days how does it feel to live in your mother's basement actually i i make my videos
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:33.760]  in my kitchen which get about a third of the views of your mainstream shows mother's kitchen no it's
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:37.920]  my kitchen jim okay yeah where i get a third of the viewers of anderson cooper and i'm just a guy
[2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:43.120]  on a laptop sure yeah oh sure i don't think that book scan tracks the sales of my books because
[2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:46.320]  i self-published them in the way that they're distributed if not they would have made it to
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:53.440]  the top maybe not by the way it's positive i get up i had a real beef with um mark dice because i
[2:36:53.440 --> 2:37:01.360]  actually look at the ratings reliable sources had about 100 000 viewers anderson cooper has about
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:08.080]  500 000 on average the average mark dice video gets 500 000 views i watch it religiously so you're
[2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:16.640]  full of crap mark stop saying get a third of their views you're bigger than them from your kitchen
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:23.200]  plus he's got the best t-shirts out there just just go back to mark dice actually i i make my
[2:37:23.200 --> 2:37:28.480]  videos in my kitchen which get about a third of the views of your mainstream show mother's kitchen
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:32.480]  no it's my kitchen jim okay yeah where i get a third of the viewers of anderson cooper and i'm
[2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:37.760]  just a guy on a laptop sure yeah oh sure i don't think that book scan tracks the sales of my books
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:41.280]  because i self-published them in the way that they're distributed if not they would have made it to
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:45.200]  the top maybe not the number one spot but they would have definitely made it to the top three of
[2:37:45.200 --> 2:37:49.040]  the wall street journal and the usa today best solos and the americ times of course yeah that's
[2:37:49.040 --> 2:37:53.600]  right dishonest you may recall and please forgive the humble brag but when my book hollywood propaganda
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:37:59.120]  how tv movies and music shape our culture came out in october 2020 it made it up to number three
[2:37:59.120 --> 2:38:05.680]  on the amazon bestseller list of all books which again is an authentic algorithm driven sales rank
[2:38:05.680 --> 2:38:09.760]  the other reason i wrote that book is because my previous book deliver media duster complex which
[2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:14.160]  came out a year earlier only made it up to number two and i was so pissed that i wanted to make it
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:18.800]  to number one so i wrote another book but still didn't do it so i'm gonna give it one more shot
[2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:22.240]  not at the end of this year i'm working on another book but it would take my time as you'll know
[2:38:22.240 --> 2:38:26.400]  they're polished they're extremely well documented and thoroughly sourced so i should have another
[2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:31.360]  one out by the end of next year but until then let's keep alex jones book the great reset at the
[2:38:31.360 --> 2:38:36.720]  top of the bestseller lists at least the ones that won't sense are rich and i'm glad that i got a hard
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:40.800]  copy because the way things are going this might be a collector's item someday so i left a link
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:45.440]  to the amazon listing in the description below so click it and head on over there and check it out
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:51.040]  all right so the strategy this is really important for the broadcast and all free speech
[2:38:51.040 --> 2:38:55.520]  the strategy in the last fake trial where i'm already found guilty a month ago in this new one
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:38:58.240]  where the judge is promising to hold me in contempt or even get there next week
[2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:06.880]  is that i have hundreds of millions of dollars on my children i don't have a million and a half
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:13.120]  dollars in the bank and as big an operation as this is that's like on e and i don't want to get
[2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:18.400]  into all this but just a week ago we're like hey we're doing well in the chapter five bankruptcy
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:22.720]  all we gotta do is prove we're profitable and then whatever judgments they have can't shut us down
[2:39:22.720 --> 2:39:26.560]  just whatever profit there is in the future these jerks get but who cares we're on air we don't care
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:30.800]  about money and they're openly saying get rid of the bankruptcy just shut him down to the
[2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:34.880]  bankruptcy judge the judge is like whoa that's not what you're supposed to do so they've jumped
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:41.040]  the shark but this lie because again they said the bankruptcy court a month ago and a month ago
[2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:48.960]  in the fake trial they said uh jones company's worth 130 million and jones is worth 2006 million
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:57.920]  and and they added so it's like 400 million total i wish i had that we don't and so again they told
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:01.440]  and so the jury said well we don't want to shut him down like they said we just want to give each
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:06.320]  plane of 10 percent of his wealth well each 10 percent was more wealth than i have so that's the
[2:40:06.320 --> 2:40:11.760]  lie so listeners do not believe their garbage and don't let me prove that we're right on the
[2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:18.880]  edge of insolvency by going under or being shut down go to infowarstore.com i had said last week
[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:27.040]  i'm stopping sales of signed books a week and a half ago because we had to sign 10 000 plus
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:34.960]  today i will finish the last 500 it's been grueling it's been crazy but you took us over the top
[2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:40.560]  put us in the black and so another six seven thousand books ten thousand got delivered yesterday
[2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:44.720]  three or four thousand whatever the number is i forget the exact number like three thousand
[2:40:44.720 --> 2:40:48.720]  of the ten thousand will be the regular book price if you want to do a fundraiser and buy the
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:53.840]  signed book it's available infowarstore.com you could not act in a more important way to defeat
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:40:58.480]  the new world order then they go to infowarstore.com and get a signed book it's got the markup keep us
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:02.480]  on there again the npr already gets billions of dollars to taxpayer money so does pbs but they
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:08.240]  still do fundraisers wear our coffee cups a hundred bucks and a t-shirts a hundred bucks and a dvd set
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:12.800]  that costs fifty dollars is three hundred dollars and you that's the point of this is a fundraising
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:19.440]  item but we don't get taxpayer money we're funded by you so go to infowarstore.com and get the great
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:24.400]  reset in the war for the world by alex jones with the markup there to keep us on air i want to think

[2:44:03.760 --> 2:44:08.720]  chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but
[2:44:08.720 --> 2:44:14.880]  because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:20.320]  fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first
[2:44:20.320 --> 2:44:29.200]  came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was
[2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:34.240]  hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[2:44:34.240 --> 2:44:40.960]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this
[2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:45.440]  world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the

[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:08.800]  Chiapas mexico the communist well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:14.320]  harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from
[2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:18.160]  the little farmers that you know the media calls communist but really they're just a commune and
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:22.080]  whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:25.440]  mexican government take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:29.200]  it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under

[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:18.320]  all right let's play some clips here this isn't about alex jones it's about the murder of free
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:26.560]  speech the murder of your process here is the judge the puppet judge the plaintiffs that
[2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:31.680]  have already found us guilty now they still want a fake show trial on the damages trying to pre-scream
[2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:35.440]  my lawyer's questions you wonder why my lawyer in texas couldn't talk he was threatened with
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:43.440]  sanctions if he did he's just there as a puppet to act like they're having a trial here's a clip
[2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:48.880]  why don't we address that right now so that we don't get the jury upset moving them in and out a
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:54.560]  million times is there a sense you've told me i can't ask you about maybe tell me i'm not going
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:49:03.360]  with i would i'm not going okay i understand you of course they're not one minute so i'm i don't
[2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:09.120]  so i'm not going to give it to you did the hillard plan now we get the med and tell me should we
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:18.160]  address what's coming next no well i think it might make sense judge there's i'm not it's i'm not
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:24.480]  responsible for giving my adversaries a preview of what's to come anymore and apparently
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:27.360]  they were responsible for telling me what witnesses they were going to call today
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:35.360]  unprecedented evil here is the fbi you never knew his name never said his name into who the
[2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:40.800]  hell he is still he sued me he wants ten million dollars because he was in the fbi again the trash
[2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:44.800]  delivery guy or a guy putting light bulbs in the school i questioned sandy hook so now
[2:49:44.800 --> 2:49:54.480]  i mean here he is that's a photograph of you this uh flanked by two other agents
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:50:01.280]  they're task force officers um these these these weren't guys on the SWAT team i presume no they were
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:07.120]  task force officers from pitchboard right and so you you mentioned that this photograph was
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:13.600]  distributed worldwide in the new space i don't know what's happening distractor i was this one
[2:50:13.600 --> 2:50:19.680]  of the photographs that was distributed worldwide i didn't say worldwide but the um i'm not sure sir
[2:50:19.680 --> 2:50:24.800]  i didn't see other photographs but i never said worldwide okay a person looking at that how would
[2:50:24.800 --> 2:50:37.600]  they know if you were an fbi agent they wouldn't they wouldn't so the internet questioned him
[2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:41.840]  i never even knew who the hell he was i never saw that photo he's suing me for we're saying
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:46.080]  500 million dollars i was just saying 10 million to be low because there's a bunch of a bunch of
[2:50:46.080 --> 2:50:51.600]  plaintiffs i mean i don't even know who he is the internet question so it's my fault i mean it's
[2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:59.920]  it's just it's absurd and and here he is clip to admitting i never said his name here it is
[2:51:00.720 --> 2:51:05.360]  Santiago's stuff those were the calls that you were told about correct where your fellow
[2:51:05.360 --> 2:51:11.280]  agent says Santiago's calls halbix calls and multiple halbix calls you to halbix call the fbi
[2:51:11.280 --> 2:51:19.520]  i didn't speak to him okay now how many times did jones call you he didn't call me sir um did you
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:26.800]  ever see this photograph 289 on info wars um i didn't know sir do you know whether he ever
[2:51:26.800 --> 2:51:32.480]  talked about you on info wars i don't i don't know if halbix appears as a guest on a talk show
[2:51:32.480 --> 2:51:37.840]  does that make him affiliated with the talk show to me it does okay so if i appear on cnn tonight
[2:51:37.840 --> 2:51:50.400]  i'm seeing that the way yes you are okay so if norm patis my lawyer goes on cnn says that
[2:51:50.960 --> 2:51:58.560]  easter bunnies lay purple eggs cnn goes to jail not true easter bunnies don't exist they don't lay
[2:51:58.560 --> 2:52:04.640]  purple eggs it's ridiculous fbi's it claims alex jones is back my powerful people he was asked that
[2:52:04.640 --> 2:52:10.000]  by the plaintiffs lawyers they want to say trump so they said joe rogan oh joe rogan's gonna come
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:17.520]  get him hell sue him joe rogan ever said your name might as well i mean this is how outlandish it is
[2:52:17.520 --> 2:52:23.920]  with a default judgment rigged court where the juries told you're guilty here it is these
[2:52:23.920 --> 2:52:30.400]  lies being on the internet how'd you dealt with that you just have to at some point you have to
[2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:38.160]  just accept it and i mean alex jones and his company these are very powerful people
[2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:46.240]  and i'm not anybody and so some of the like me can't you just can't defend yourself you just
[2:52:46.240 --> 2:52:51.600]  have to at some point you have to accept it and like any crisis that we all deal with in our
[2:52:51.600 --> 2:52:57.280]  lives i don't guess we have to just maybe you just have to deal with it but how do you deal with it
[2:52:57.280 --> 2:53:05.120]  that's what i'm asking is what steps did you take in well i i i try to get help i try to get the
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:12.720]  bureau to help me and then and then you know i uh call the agents association to see if they could
[2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:19.600]  help me and that that ended up um you know it didn't result in anything they basically just gave me
[2:53:19.600 --> 2:53:29.840]  the run around and then finally you know the only person ever even listen was mr. koskoff he's he you
[2:53:29.840 --> 2:53:34.960]  know he was gentleman gracious enough to listen to me and that's why we're here they're going to be a
[2:53:34.960 --> 2:53:38.880]  waiver objection relevance unless there's going to be a waiver if you're going to fight over
[2:53:39.840 --> 2:53:46.960]  move strike so i don't know who this guy is never said his name he never heard me talk about him
[2:53:46.960 --> 2:53:52.240]  until today i don't know who the hell he is how about some random homeless guy just see me well
[2:53:52.240 --> 2:53:58.720]  you question sandy hook so i'm going to see me he's powerful he's going to get what the hell
[2:53:58.720 --> 2:54:05.120]  are you talking about don't even know who you are you got this former federal prosecutor
[2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:11.360]  the railroad of the former governor of canada get sitting up there pretending look at this headline
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:17.760]  new york times you read the article that they never say this in here alex jones trial takeaways
[2:54:17.760 --> 2:54:24.400]  witnesses describe conspiracy theorists following them after the ship i and it says i followed the
[2:54:24.400 --> 2:54:32.240]  fbi agent i followed him what and what lucky charms flew around me there were there were
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:37.200]  leprechauns there too and like easter bunnies i mean this is the level of these people
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:44.480]  folks never said their name and they're crying going jones question whether it was jesse schmollett
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:49.280]  or wmd said iraq any of this the internet said we think it didn't happen i looked at what they said
[2:54:49.280 --> 2:54:56.640]  and years later once trump runs for office and wins now he's the sandy hook guy and then we give him
[2:54:56.640 --> 2:55:04.480]  all our emails all our bank accounts everything which are showing the jury the judge says i'm
[2:55:04.480 --> 2:55:08.800]  not going to tell you why he's defaulted he just admits he's guilty and the judge says i'm going
[2:55:08.800 --> 2:55:13.520]  to sanction him when he gets here if he says he's innocent even in north korea you can say you're
[2:55:13.520 --> 2:55:18.720]  innocent even if you're shot down in vietnam and vietnam war you could say but not in america
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:26.560]  because it's a liberal and she's a woman you are not innocent you do not say you're innocent
[2:55:26.560 --> 2:55:32.800]  you come in this court and you say you're guilty i'll put you in jail because i'm a woman i'm like
[2:55:32.800 --> 2:55:39.520]  oh my gosh you're a woman uh oh it's it's it's so sick what soros does
[2:55:41.200 --> 2:55:46.240]  let's play the contempt clip here's clip five play it you know we have a request for a curative
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:51.520]  instruction uh what i expect when alex jones comes up here he's going to violate the court's
[2:55:51.520 --> 2:55:57.440]  orders i expect that i do not expect attorney patis in his openings try and unwind the default
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:56:02.880]  by repeatedly stating and suggesting that alex jones was just questioning are we gonna are we
[2:56:02.880 --> 2:56:08.240]  gonna silence the crazy person into town square for just he was doing it by referring to the
[2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:12.960]  other events that alex jones's question the jury is going to be instructed that alex jones
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:18.480]  intended these statements knowing that they were false and so we need a curative instruction at
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:24.640]  the outset because what attorney patis has done has injected not only politics and he's injected
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:28.560]  us we're gonna come back the next five and play this and and we'll put it the whole thing up on

[3:00:01.120 --> 3:00:08.240]  you are watching the death of due process you are watching the venezuelan style takeover of america
[3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:15.600]  alex jones here back live so here is the so-called judge threatening alex jones with contempt
[3:00:15.600 --> 3:00:20.400]  as she threatens my lawyer that they can't raise any issues or basically have free speech
[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:25.600]  or say that we're innocent or tell that the jury hey a judge shouldn't find me guilty why are you
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:30.160]  being told to find how guilty i am you're not guilty until proven how guilty you're innocent
[3:00:30.160 --> 3:00:36.560]  until proven guilty so let's go ahead and play this on islay would make north korea or venezuela
[3:00:36.560 --> 3:00:43.840]  blanche here it is we have a request for a cure to instruction uh what i expect when alex jones
[3:00:43.840 --> 3:00:48.640]  comes up here he's going to violate the court's orders i expect that i do not expect attorney
[3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:53.760]  patis in his opening to try and unwind the default by repeatedly stating and suggesting
[3:00:53.760 --> 3:00:58.080]  that alex jones was just questioning are we going to are we going to silence the crazy
[3:00:58.080 --> 3:01:03.120]  person in the town square for just he was doing it by referring to the other events that alex
[3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:09.680]  jones's question the jury is going to be instructed that alex jones intended these statements knowing
[3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:15.040]  that they were false and so we need to cure the instruction at the outset because what attorney
[3:01:15.040 --> 3:01:21.280]  patis has done has injected not only politics but he's injected this idea that alex jones was nearly
[3:01:21.280 --> 3:01:26.080]  questioning when the jury is going to be instructing the court's determined that he intentionally
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:31.200]  inflicted emotional stress that he intentionally lied that he acted with malice i hadn't intended
[3:01:31.200 --> 3:01:37.440]  to go as far as i did until i heard the opening statement that my adversaries gave and this is
[3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:43.280]  not an issue i could have objected at first sentence this has nothing to do with stopping alex jones
[3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:49.920]  this is a compensatory damage claim and they went 15 minutes they've become you know stopping alex
[3:01:49.920 --> 3:01:56.480]  jones is not an element of their damages they went 15 minutes before they even turned to anything
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:02.480]  related to mr jones 35 minutes before they mentioned the family and then they gave a passing
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:10.400]  reference to damages alex jones must be stopped they said and i it is our contention that mr
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:16.640]  jones that the plaintiffs in this case exaggerate the harm that he caused to him uh or that he caused
[3:02:16.640 --> 3:02:22.240]  them and they exaggerated for political reasons and so if they had not come in and said stop alex
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:26.880]  jones that objection to request for a curative instruction might have some teeth but they're
[3:02:26.880 --> 3:02:30.960]  not on their own words right now i don't intend to give a curative instruction at this point
[3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:37.040]  but as things develop and especially if there are issues uh further issues then renew your request
[3:02:37.040 --> 3:02:43.680]  and i would be inclined to do so right in the midst of the witness and i am going to deal with
[3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:51.520]  uh mr jones when he testifies understood um i i do expect as i discussed attorney pant patis and i
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:58.640]  thought you were on board with it i expected to canvas him on the issues that um that were off
[3:02:58.640 --> 3:03:05.520]  limits the law of the case is not complicated but i do think the court is we would not object to a
[3:03:05.520 --> 3:03:12.000]  case and i did tell you that um if there are issues i will address contempt on the spot well i mean
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:18.560]  that i don't have any reason to believe that i'm just telling you i'm telling you now um i believe
[3:03:18.560 --> 3:03:25.200]  you said the last time that you can't remember your exact words that but something along the
[3:03:25.200 --> 3:03:29.600]  lines i thought that you weren't going to be able to control what he said so i'm just laying it out
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:34.560]  there now putting everybody on notice so um i know you'll do your job attorney patis and it's
[3:03:34.560 --> 3:03:42.640]  going to him um what is off limits all right so we will oh that's good now just take a five minute
[3:03:42.640 --> 3:03:49.200]  so since when can a witness not say what they want you see murder trials where the murderer gets up
[3:03:49.200 --> 3:03:56.240]  and talks crap but oh he can't talk he can't say i defaulted in he can't say we gave you all the
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:04:02.640]  documents he can't say he never said their names he i'm gonna i'm gonna get him i'm gonna get him
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:07.680]  i'm gonna put him in jail if he doesn't do what i want just shaking with all the news cameras are

[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:48.800]  it's wrong they want to shut up you can't say that and then their own lawyer got him and said we
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:05:00.640]  didn't want to shut him down i mean these people are a joke just look at these headlines from
[3:05:00.640 --> 3:05:08.160]  Reuters world faces unprecedented global hunger crisis un chief says going into 2023 world food

[3:07:31.280 --> 3:07:36.000]  Like when NPR, who already gets billions in taxpayer money or PBS, we don't get that.
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:40.240]  They will sell, again, a ball cap for $100, a t-shirt for $100, a DVD for $100,

[3:08:08.160 --> 3:08:11.920]  not just Tucker Carlson, not just Joe Rogan, not just all of it. They're listening. We're
[3:08:11.920 --> 3:08:15.280]  having the biggest effect ever. But we can't stay in the fight without your support. We're not backed
[3:08:15.280 --> 3:08:21.280]  by George Soros. We're backed by yours. Get the Man in the Arena coin at 1776coin.com or

[3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:32.400]  All right. Pete Santilli, you've been a political president. You've been a journalist for decades.
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:36.880]  You've been a marine with classification, working on secret projects. I know you got a lot to
[3:08:36.880 --> 3:08:40.800]  cover it with the big purge and the hundreds of FBI raids and all the rest of it, but just,
[3:08:40.800 --> 3:08:44.800]  I'm going to turn loose and I'm going to be listening to you. I respect you. I want your view.
[3:08:45.600 --> 3:08:49.920]  What do you make of the weaponization of these saying, shut him down, shut him up?
[3:08:49.920 --> 3:08:54.400]  My lawyer says, okay, it's wrong to shut out of shows up. They go, stop, kick the jury out.
[3:08:54.400 --> 3:08:57.200]  You can't say we're trying to shut you down. And the former federal prosecutor,
[3:08:57.200 --> 3:09:00.240]  Chris Mann, he said, this is ridiculous. Nobody's trying to shut him down.
[3:09:00.240 --> 3:09:04.720]  They did that in my Texas trial a month ago. They said, nobody's de-platforming him. Nobody's
[3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:10.000]  silencing him. And the closing statement, we're silencing him. Our mission is to shut him down.
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:14.480]  What is, what the hell are they doing here? You know, yesterday when the,
[3:09:14.480 --> 3:09:23.600]  when the attorney got up for the plaintiff, spoke to the jury and complained that we must award a,
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:28.720]  you know, verdict against him. In so many words, he was just saying, we must punish Alex Jones.
[3:09:28.720 --> 3:09:33.760]  And he's mentioned something that is something to the effect of that your broadcasts were for
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:38.640]  profit, you know, your extremist broadcast, not, not his words, mine.
[3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:41.920]  And the lie that I made money off Sandy Hill was a minor thing we covered.
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:48.240]  They attached themselves to me. Yes, exactly. And, you know, well, that attorney himself,
[3:09:48.240 --> 3:09:55.200]  and all of these bandwagoning ambulans chasing, I called him chimpanzees, the hire, the award,
[3:09:55.200 --> 3:09:58.800]  of course. And thank God, I'm not your attorney, because I would have gotten up and said, what
[3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:04.800]  that attorney just said is, you know, raise the penalty so that I can make a heck of a lot more
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:10.560]  money. That's all these people are doing. The hire, the award, of course, that the higher the
[3:10:10.560 --> 3:10:14.960]  percentage that these attorneys get. And that's what they're doing in the previous trial. But
[3:10:14.960 --> 3:10:20.960]  ultimately, Alex, I'm sure that you'll be successful on appeals. I've never, ever,
[3:10:20.960 --> 3:10:26.640]  even through what I went through in the federal court system, I've never seen just a blatant
[3:10:26.640 --> 3:10:31.600]  disregard for civil rights for our, our, our God-given rights.
[3:10:31.600 --> 3:10:37.360]  But do you think that question is no one's ever seen this? Why are they so brazen? Why are they so
[3:10:37.360 --> 3:10:45.280]  arrogant? You know, well, first and foremost, like, in federal court, they did some things to
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:53.360]  some of our defendants, like Wiseman, for instance, when he was prosecuting in the, the Enron cases.
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:10:57.200]  He knew that he could just violate the law and they get their pound of flesh because you take
[3:10:57.200 --> 3:11:02.800]  it up on appeal. If you can send somebody to jail, they sit there for five to eight years on
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:08.480]  appeal. They, they know that no matter what they do, you'll take it up on appeal. The objective is
[3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:14.720]  to extract millions of dollars from you. This law fair operation against you is to break you
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:17.280]  in the millions of dollars. It's still going to cost you a lot.
[3:11:17.280 --> 3:11:20.400]  And by the way, they admit that. That's why Wiseman understand we're going to win this,
[3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:21.360]  but they've got to back us.
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:27.680]  Oh, absolutely. That's the most important thing is that that's how we, the people, push back
[3:11:27.680 --> 3:11:31.680]  against these law fair operators. These leftists, it's, you know, when they say law fair, it's
[3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:36.160]  warfare, but they're using the weaponizing the judiciary.
[3:11:36.160 --> 3:11:40.960]  Let me tell you that Chris Matty guy deposed me three different days and then defaulted the
[3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:45.200]  saying we didn't show up for depositions and the judge doesn't care. When he would talk about us
[3:11:45.200 --> 3:11:50.080]  fundraising, he would shake with hate. They hate the American people. They just, why do they hate
[3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:54.400]  America? Who are these people? They just like, they hate America. What's wrong with them?
[3:11:54.400 --> 3:12:02.000]  You know, in, in the next segment, I'm going to talk about, and I think our, through our research
[3:12:02.880 --> 3:12:08.000]  on Mike Lindell's team, this thing that he's got going on, of course, as well as some of the
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:12.160]  stuff that Trump, President Trump has been doing, you know, it started, believe it or not, in the
[3:12:12.160 --> 3:12:17.680]  mid nineties. If you ever wondered how they were able to capture the Supreme Court, how to, you
[3:12:17.680 --> 3:12:23.120]  know, get the vote of a Supreme Court justice in Roberts, how they're able to convert the
[3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:27.040]  entire federal judiciary. You know, they've got their political operatives, of course, when they
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:32.080]  select, like Obama selects his judges, but you know what, they've got the same Epstein-style
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:37.760]  blackmail on all of these judges. That's how they've installed these communists all the way down
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:41.440]  to the, you know, the local, the county level, the school boards.
[3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:44.400]  I agree. What percentage are pedophiles because they keep getting busted?
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:47.440]  What was that? I'm sorry, Mr.
[3:12:47.440 --> 3:12:49.840]  What percentage of these people are pedophiles, do you think?
[3:12:49.840 --> 3:12:54.880]  You know, can you imagine? I think that they're, they actually recruit people to install like that
[3:12:54.880 --> 3:12:59.360]  so that they can know. Well, no, it came out last year, the CIA recruited pedophiles in Afghanistan
[3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:04.560]  to run local towns because they could control them. That's how the CIA recruited pedophiles
[3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:09.440]  to run Afghan villages. Look it up. Their surveillance capabilities are unmatched.
[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:13.840]  And guess where I learned these techniques was through the nexium trials, how they actually
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:18.400]  build their cult. And you actually, in order to become a member of the cult, you have to give them
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:24.240]  a bag of collateral. If you should ever share the secrets of their sex trafficking operations,
[3:13:24.240 --> 3:13:29.760]  well, guess what? They release the videos or the pictures of you with a, you know, with a 12-year-old
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:34.640]  girl or boy. So they're specifically targeting these people. And then those that are in
[3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:41.600]  officer on the bench, you know, Imran Awan, we have to ask the Federal Bureau of Laptops what
[3:13:41.600 --> 3:13:46.000]  they did with all that information like Imran Awan's Laptops where he was spying on Democrats
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:50.320]  and Republicans. You're about to take over, but let me ask you this. If you, if you were me,
[3:13:51.120 --> 3:13:55.440]  should I even go to this kangaroo trial? I'm set to fly there next week. And, but she's like,
[3:13:55.440 --> 3:14:00.640]  I'm going to hold you in contempt once you get here. Yeah, well, I had to put myself in that
[3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:06.640]  monster that Kim Jong-un's jurisdiction. Nothing against nor patis. I think he's a great constitutional
[3:14:06.640 --> 3:14:11.760]  attorney. I'd like to see you go pro se and stand at the podium and defend yourself because you did
[3:14:11.760 --> 3:14:17.040]  a masterful job as a witness, of course, able, able to speak in your own defense on the witness
[3:14:17.040 --> 3:14:21.600]  stand. Why don't you just go pro se? I mean, if they're set, setting you up to lose, why not get
[3:14:21.600 --> 3:14:27.120]  a, because it's all a show trial, of course, they've got that camera rolling. You know, I thought it
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:31.840]  was disgusting how she found you contemptuous that you should not show up. Well, why do you have an
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:36.240]  attorney? Your attorney's representing. You have to sit there. I missed that. So they agreed to only
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:41.040]  have me there next week. Oh, they made an issue. I wasn't there. Oh, they made, they said that
[3:14:41.040 --> 3:14:45.760]  they were going to deal with you because you should dare not be there. She was very, very upset by
[3:14:45.760 --> 3:14:49.520]  the fact that you weren't even present. Well, I was busy on air trying to keep it. Wow, I didn't
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:56.640]  know that. So they made an issue of when it's the court agreed to be beat. Wow. Yeah, she had a big
[3:14:56.640 --> 3:15:03.040]  issue with that. But you know, how dare she, of course, take away your livelihood through that
[3:15:03.040 --> 3:15:08.160]  system of lawfare to extract all this wealth, have you spend millions of dollars and then say that
[3:15:08.160 --> 3:15:14.240]  you can't earn an income to help pay for your defense? Absolutely. I didn't know this. I'm
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:19.040]  going to call Norm. He's in court right now. They got mad. They made an issue. I wasn't there where
[3:15:19.040 --> 3:15:24.400]  the court said when they want to be there. And in the very beginning, she made an issue of it.
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:33.120]  Yeah, I listened pretty closely. What a disgust. You have a lot to cover. Take over, my friend.
[3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:37.200]  You got a lot to say. You got a lot to cover with the purge and Democrats everywhere saying,
[3:15:37.200 --> 3:15:40.880]  Congress members, Hillary, we're waiting to kill the MAGA people.
[3:15:40.880 --> 3:15:45.360]  We need war. We need civil war. I mean, this is cuckoo land. The last thing we want is violence,
[3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:47.920]  folks, but they're definitely hyping it. The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:51.760]  here's your signed copy at infowarshore.com. Thank you all for keeping us on air. We'll be right back.
[3:15:56.480 --> 3:16:03.600]  Our world is so full of hype. We are force-fed, dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media,
[3:16:03.600 --> 3:16:09.200]  by the controlled churches and the universities. Why is this the case? Because we innately,
[3:16:09.200 --> 3:16:13.840]  by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyches, our own souls.
[3:16:14.560 --> 3:16:18.400]  And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and trend,
[3:16:18.400 --> 3:16:24.960]  send the quote, fallen or sinful state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we
[3:16:24.960 --> 3:16:30.560]  try to bring into our bodies to change who we are, are only lowering us. They're only making
[3:16:30.560 --> 3:16:35.360]  us more depressed. In the end, they're only making us less fulfilled. It is only by going
[3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:39.280]  within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:44.160]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the
[3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:49.840]  normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to
[3:16:49.840 --> 3:16:54.160]  basically reach out beyond the third dimension. And that's where the incredible products come in
[3:16:54.160 --> 3:17:01.520]  at mfullwarstore.com. Ultimate fish oil is back in stock at mfullwarstore.com. What does ultimate

[3:18:23.120 --> 3:18:28.960]  Goramacide, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian

[3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:40.800]  essential nutrient, Koli, and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.

[3:18:51.520 --> 3:18:59.360]  before it is completely sold out at M4store.com. Donald Trump and the Magna Republicans represented
[3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:05.520]  extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic. I wouldn't be surprised if this
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:11.680]  doesn't have an operational name. In fact, I bet it does. I bet it's called Operation
[3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:19.360]  Matador. They see us as the bull and they are shaky, a red flag in our face and the Matador is
[3:19:19.360 --> 3:19:25.760]  the deep state with a long skinny razor sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward,
[3:19:25.760 --> 3:19:31.440]  the Matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:36.240]  as the bull buries himself into the dust. They've got the ace of spades in their hand,
[3:19:36.240 --> 3:19:41.360]  which is false flags. Before you launch a war, you stage false flags. That's the first thing you
[3:19:41.360 --> 3:19:46.880]  do because nobody wants to say they started a war. Bad guys start wars. So every time a war gets
[3:19:46.880 --> 3:19:52.000]  launched by bad guys, they stage an event. This is Operation Matador.
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:20:07.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.920 --> 3:20:18.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show on Infowars.com.
[3:20:18.160 --> 3:20:26.400]  I'm Pete Santilli, gladly and proudly filling in however I can, especially in light of the
[3:20:27.120 --> 3:20:32.560]  important work that the folks of Infowars are doing and having to navigate their way around this
[3:20:32.560 --> 3:20:39.200]  lawfare operation with the multiple lawsuits that are bogging down America for that matter
[3:20:39.840 --> 3:20:48.800]  in their attacks of Infowars and Alex Jones. I'm so proud to step up today in this fourth hour.
[3:20:48.800 --> 3:20:55.440]  It's such an important time in our nation's history, of course, to bring to you some good news.
[3:20:55.440 --> 3:21:02.240]  We've been feeling a lot of anxiety. A lot of people have been feeling a sense of mourning almost
[3:21:02.240 --> 3:21:08.080]  for our country. We've been, of course, on the defensive for many, many years ever since
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:15.840]  President Trump was seated after he was elected in 2016. He was attacked and slowly but surely we
[3:21:15.840 --> 3:21:21.120]  started to figure out the attacks upon him were an attack upon each and every one of us and that
[3:21:21.120 --> 3:21:28.160]  attack has not stopped. But we, the people have been feeling a sense of having to be on the defensive,
[3:21:28.160 --> 3:21:35.520]  having to respond to the narrative scripting by the left-wing crazed, oh my goodness,
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:40.560]  these people up and down the chain of command from the political realm to the, of course,
[3:21:40.560 --> 3:21:46.560]  every single institution that the deep state has been installed within our system. This narrative
[3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:53.040]  scripting by the mainstream media, by Silicon Valley, these people seizing the reins of power
[3:21:53.040 --> 3:21:59.040]  of every single institution, every single law enforcement operation, every single intelligent
[3:21:59.040 --> 3:22:04.400]  service to put America into a state of coup d'etat. But I'm going to tell you something right now.
[3:22:04.960 --> 3:22:10.160]  Some things have happened here within, I'd say within the past couple of months that should
[3:22:10.160 --> 3:22:18.960]  give us a sense of empowerment and guess what, an uplifting of us going on the offensive.
[3:22:18.960 --> 3:22:24.720]  I have a couple of examples here that I have been covering in my show on The Pete's Hand
[3:22:24.720 --> 3:22:30.560]  Tilly Show. We broadcast probably on Lindell TV in the morning and, of course, in the evening.
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:34.880]  We're now escalating our streaming because of the importance of the information we're covering to
[3:22:34.880 --> 3:22:41.040]  six hours per day. And then, of course, filling in wherever we can on m4s.com. You can find us,
[3:22:41.040 --> 3:22:48.240]  by the way, you'll see our most important interviews and most important posts on band.video.
[3:22:48.240 --> 3:22:55.360]  You can find me at Pete's Hand Tilly on band.video. Now, the past couple of days, 24 or 48 hours,
[3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:02.320]  have been pretty intense. As you know, the Mar-a-Lago rage, of course, they're putting the
[3:23:02.320 --> 3:23:06.480]  pressure and, of course, the mainstream media painting a narrative that President Trump has
[3:23:06.480 --> 3:23:14.400]  some sort of a stack of top secret documents with nuclear information. That is so completely
[3:23:14.400 --> 3:23:19.440]  false, I believe, just because not that I have inside information. I'm a dot connector, like we
[3:23:19.440 --> 3:23:25.120]  all are. There's a lot of dots out there and plenty of circumstantial evidence that will
[3:23:25.680 --> 3:23:31.920]  support the, I'm going to say, the theory. Because, yes, I can only be a conspiracy theory
[3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:37.040]  theorist on the outside of what's going on with President Trump with the coup d'etat
[3:23:37.040 --> 3:23:43.440]  upon America. But I will say this unequivocally. And we are going to go on the offensive here,
[3:23:43.440 --> 3:23:47.760]  especially as of this broadcast right now. It's the first time you've heard my voice,
[3:23:47.760 --> 3:23:54.720]  first time you've heard my theories before the end of this hour, this segment. I think
[3:23:54.720 --> 3:24:00.240]  that you will be convinced that there's plenty of evidence to show that people like President
[3:24:00.240 --> 3:24:08.640]  Donald J. Trump has evidence of this coup d'etat. He has evidence of the FBI's involvement
[3:24:08.640 --> 3:24:14.160]  in the Russia collusion thing. But it's much bigger than that. And I'll explain that to you
[3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:19.520]  in a couple of different ways. That people like Mike Lindell, who has been leading the charge,
[3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:24.160]  he's much more than the pillow guy. And imagine this, ladies and gentlemen, if you ever wondered
[3:24:25.200 --> 3:24:30.160]  what is happening in this new economy, people like Mike Lindell building a $300 million plus
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:35.280]  company, he takes a portion of those proceeds and what does he do? He invests in helping to save
[3:24:35.280 --> 3:24:42.240]  America. Same thing is happening right now. This broadcast, this network info wars through your
[3:24:42.240 --> 3:24:48.400]  support at infowarstore.com, through us, of course, taking most recently Alex Jones' book
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:57.120]  and making it the number one selling book on the New York Times bestsellers. The second bestseller,
[3:24:57.120 --> 3:25:01.840]  of course, ends up at the number one. That's part of the suppression, of course. But through that
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:10.960]  support, the work that Alex Jones has done over the years to monetize his work, of course, rolling
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:17.520]  it in to reaching more people to help save America to deliver the truth about the world we live in.
[3:25:17.520 --> 3:25:24.320]  Mike Lindell doing that. Now, what has Mike Lindell been doing? I'm on Lindell TV. And
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:28.080]  whenever there's information that's important that needs to be broadcast, I go to the
[3:25:28.080 --> 3:25:34.240]  Cyber Symposium and I went to the moment of truth. So I followed the work of a great team
[3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:40.880]  of people that he surrounded himself with, forensic investigators, election integrity experts,
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:46.560]  legislators that are understanding, especially in the battleground states, exactly what happened
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:51.760]  in the November 2020 election. Well, Colorado is one of those significant events. If you don't know
[3:25:51.760 --> 3:25:59.680]  the name Tina Peters, if you don't know the name Jeff O'Donnell, Jeff O'Donnell, one of our nation's
[3:26:00.400 --> 3:26:09.280]  greatest patriots, provided in Colorado a forensic report that Mike Lindell had basically helped
[3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:15.600]  finance, built a team of people, Tina Peters, an election official, discovered that one of the
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:19.840]  electronic voting machines who shall remain nameless, because I don't want to mention it on
[3:26:19.840 --> 3:26:25.600]  this network. That's all we need. It's another lawsuit coming at infowars.com. But I will say
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:30.560]  this for the purposes of staying away from that and not bringing any heat. They can sue me personally.
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:37.040]  Come get me because I've got enough evidence and information to back up what I'm about to say here,
[3:26:37.040 --> 3:26:45.040]  and it's going to be coming out. Tina Peters actually made a copy, a forensic image of disks
[3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:48.640]  that she was asked to send to the electronic voting machine company. They said,
[3:26:48.640 --> 3:26:53.120]  Senator Destin, we're going to do a trusted builder. We're going to do some magic and we'll send
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:59.600]  this stuff back to you. Well, she by law said, I need to make sure that I maintain a copy. I made
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:05.520]  she made a forensic image of that. She sent them the disk and what she got back, surprisingly,
[3:27:06.560 --> 3:27:12.080]  was a deletion of the election. Of course, she retained a copy of it, but some of the changes
[3:27:12.080 --> 3:27:20.240]  that were made on that disk compared to the copy that she had kept. Jeff O'Donnell, a cyber
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:27.200]  security expert, did an analysis of those disks and discovered that there was evidence that the
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:34.320]  2020 election through these electronic voting machines he provided, a comprehensive report
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:40.320]  that was submitted, in fact, to the public, the government, it would stand to scrutiny
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:46.080]  in a court of law. It was the first forensic report. Mike Lindell was behind that in Colorado
[3:27:46.080 --> 3:27:52.320]  to provide that very first forensic report that gave us the evidence that the 2020 election
[3:27:52.320 --> 3:27:56.560]  unequivocally was stolen. He had evidence of that and could have presented in court.
[3:27:56.560 --> 3:28:02.560]  What did Colorado do? The Secretary of State criminalized that entire sequence of events.
[3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:08.960]  Yesterday, Mike Lindell, as part of that effort to criminalize this entire process of going,
[3:28:08.960 --> 3:28:13.360]  quote, not only questioning the elections, but providing forensic evidence that the election
[3:28:13.360 --> 3:28:20.240]  was stolen, particularly in Colorado. Mike Lindell had FBI agents that were investigating
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:26.480]  felonies that he received a warrant. And after his hunting trip, the FBI pulled him over at the
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:32.240]  drive-through, getting a burger. They seized his phone. And ladies and gentlemen, I believe,
[3:28:32.240 --> 3:28:38.480]  because Mike Lindell and President Trump both have evidence to support that it was the FBI
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:42.720]  that has been part of this criminal conspiracy, along with their deep state operatives,
[3:28:42.720 --> 3:28:47.920]  that they are, in fact, perpetrating obstruction of justice. We'll make that
[3:28:47.920 --> 3:28:51.200]  case on the other side of the break. Don't go away. It's going to be a power pack down.
[3:28:56.240 --> 3:29:02.560]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[3:29:02.560 --> 3:29:08.560]  for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that
[3:29:08.560 --> 3:29:16.400]  it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I take a couple of these capsules
[3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:22.480]  from an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now, there are actually some studies out
[3:29:22.480 --> 3:29:30.000]  there linking it to amazing events in the brain. But I want you to experience it yourself. We know
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:33.600]  it's good for your heart. We know it's good for your brain. We know it's good for your arteries,
[3:29:33.600 --> 3:29:38.720]  and veins, and your lungs, and every other function of your body. But I want you to experience
[3:29:38.720 --> 3:29:43.840]  this high-grade fish oil, this ultimate fish oil at infowarstore.com, and see what it does
[3:29:43.840 --> 3:29:51.440]  if you take it before bedtime. Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[3:29:51.440 --> 3:29:54.400]  Thank you all for your support. You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.

[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:32.640]  channel, you can find us at Pete Santelli. All right, we've got a lot of information to cover
[3:33:32.640 --> 3:33:38.640]  here in the remaining balance. Now I've alleged here something pretty serious, and I know that
[3:33:38.640 --> 3:33:44.320]  they're listening. I'm the second most listened to, I would say the second most listened to
[3:33:44.320 --> 3:33:52.320]  talk show host to Alex Jones by paid federal operatives that are listening intently as to
[3:33:52.320 --> 3:33:57.680]  what their opposition is going to do. I'm going to say this, of all of the things from Joe Biden
[3:33:57.680 --> 3:34:02.480]  and all of these leftists, you feel a sense of anxiety because they're coming after us,
[3:34:02.480 --> 3:34:06.880]  and I'm going to tell you something right now. They're in high gear right now for one reason,
[3:34:06.880 --> 3:34:12.720]  one reason only, and you better feel a sense of optimism that we're turning the corner,
[3:34:12.720 --> 3:34:19.920]  we're on the offensive. They are absolutely panicked right now when I say that the FBI
[3:34:19.920 --> 3:34:27.120]  is perpetrating obstruction of justice. I know with Alex Jones, the information
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:31.760]  that he's been putting out for many, many years, asking the appropriate questions that we,
[3:34:31.760 --> 3:34:37.200]  the people deserve to have the answers to, even on topics like Sandy Hook. I had a lot of questions.
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:44.000]  Shoot, I had Wolfgang how big on my show and I did that show and I said, he's got a whole bunch
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:48.160]  of questions here. I want to know the answers to these questions, nothing wrong with that.
[3:34:48.160 --> 3:34:55.120]  Over the years, Alex Jones has done that. Well, this effort to knock him out is to obstruct
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:00.400]  information flow. This effort to go after President Trump, I'm going to make a case here right now.
[3:35:00.400 --> 3:35:07.200]  I've got pretty good circumstantial evidence. I'm a good dot connector. You guys are going to
[3:35:07.200 --> 3:35:13.440]  have to go with me on this one. President Trump, I believe, as a dot connector,
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:17.600]  I don't have inside information. I don't want any inside information I want as a
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:23.200]  broadcaster information that needs to go to the public. President Trump has evidence
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:31.440]  that, in fact, the FBI was involved with the Russia collusion hoax and at a much,
[3:35:31.440 --> 3:35:38.560]  much bigger level, that this grand conspiracy that he basically outlined in a lawsuit,
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:43.040]  that RICO case against Hillary Clinton that was most recently dismissed. We'll talk about why that
[3:35:43.040 --> 3:35:48.800]  was dismissed and why that supports my theory. Then, in fact, he has in his possession
[3:35:48.800 --> 3:35:55.680]  documentation helps support his theory in his defense with that lawsuit that was just recently
[3:35:55.680 --> 3:36:01.840]  dismissed. But he has evidence that they, in fact, are the criminals. What is the FBI doing?
[3:36:03.040 --> 3:36:10.160]  They at the behest of their DOJ masters, people like Merrick Garland, who was documented to have
[3:36:10.160 --> 3:36:15.920]  been single-handedly in charge of covering up the U.S. government's involvement in the Oklahoma City
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:23.280]  bombing, that Merrick Garland sent his goons, the FBI, to go seize documentation. Why they do that,
[3:36:23.280 --> 3:36:29.120]  we're going to talk about that momentarily. Now, also, let's talk about Mike Lindell.
[3:36:29.120 --> 3:36:34.640]  What does Mike Lindell have as it relates to Colorado? Most people don't even know about
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:39.760]  Tina Peters. She's a gold star mom. She never received so much as a parking ticket. She was
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:44.720]  actually swatting. She's under house arrest. She's not allowed to leave the state. She's being
[3:36:44.720 --> 3:36:51.760]  treated as a criminal. Why? Because she has evidence, forensic evidence, that the 2020 election
[3:36:51.760 --> 3:36:58.320]  was stolen in Colorado. With a forensic report provided by a cybersecurity expert named Jeff
[3:36:58.320 --> 3:37:04.400]  O'Donnell, Mike Lindell helped facilitate that. And what did they do? They got his cell phone
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:12.000]  yesterday, the FBI saying, you know, of course, the frontline FBI agents out there, we keep hearing
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:16.480]  this over and over again, that they're the good guys, you know, the door kickers. They're just
[3:37:16.480 --> 3:37:21.760]  doing their job. Well, they're kept compartmentalized. And I'm going to ask them right now. They're
[3:37:21.760 --> 3:37:28.160]  listening. Stop doing your job because you're obstructing justice. People like Mike Lindell
[3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:34.800]  have in his possession information related to this long-term conspiracy. And I'm just going to
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:41.920]  pick a couple of things. Colorado's won. He's helped finance the forensic examination of
[3:37:41.920 --> 3:37:49.600]  teeny Peters' discs in Mesa County, Colorado, presented it to the public. And the local officials
[3:37:49.600 --> 3:37:54.400]  there with the Secretary of State have basically criminalized that effort. Should you dare ask
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:38:01.520]  questions about the election? Should you dare provide even forensic evidence as an answer to
[3:38:01.520 --> 3:38:10.640]  those questions? That that is a criminal act. And the felony investigation is pursued by the FBI.
[3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:15.920]  They send their goons, the frontline nice guys that are just doing their job to go do what?
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:21.760]  To seize the phone of Mike Lindell. Yesterday, Mike Lindell broadcast when we cross-streamed it
[3:38:21.760 --> 3:38:27.520]  on our show live, was breaking news. He was disappointed that the FBI did not arrest him.
[3:38:27.520 --> 3:38:33.040]  He said, you're just taking my phone. This is important to the operation of my business.
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:39.520]  Why don't you arrest me? Why don't you take me in so that I can expose the 32 gigabytes
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:45.600]  of information I have that the 2020 election was stolen? That someone named Dennis Montgomery,
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:49.680]  and by the way, don't go Google that name. I've said this before, don't Google this name.
[3:38:50.560 --> 3:38:55.920]  Dennis Montgomery, right now we have all of the information. I have been involved with a team
[3:38:55.920 --> 3:39:01.280]  with Lance Miliaccio and George Bellatine, a small group of people, Jeff O'Donnell,
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:07.280]  a couple of other people that know that Dennis Montgomery's information in the possession
[3:39:07.280 --> 3:39:13.040]  of Mike Lindell will prove a couple of things. Not only that the 2020 election was stolen,
[3:39:13.840 --> 3:39:20.080]  but there's been this massive, massive conspiracy dating all the way back to the mid-90s
[3:39:20.080 --> 3:39:28.080]  by the Clinton administration with the Telecommunications Act onward to hijack the internet and privatize it.
[3:39:28.640 --> 3:39:36.240]  There is a company called Newstar. They set up Newstar as the entity. You got to go with me here,
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:40.320]  by the way. And I've been told, oh, you got to be careful. This is too complex. You can't share
[3:39:40.320 --> 3:39:47.600]  this with the, quote unquote, the goyim. That's how they treat you. They say that you folks are
[3:39:47.600 --> 3:39:53.840]  just a bunch of dumb grazers. You can't handle all of this epic truth that needs to get out
[3:39:53.840 --> 3:40:03.280]  to the American public. A company named Newstar became the private NSA. And that happened after
[3:40:03.280 --> 3:40:11.920]  9-11 or so. 9-11, and just prior to 9-11, there was this escalation of an effort to take everything
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:19.760]  in our arsenal of the most sophisticated surveillance technology to privatize everything,
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:26.000]  hijack the internet. And essentially, that is the internet where the secret shadow government
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:30.800]  is operating right now. Now, everything that I'm saying is backed up 100%. And I'm also going to
[3:40:30.800 --> 3:40:36.480]  tell you this. Although I don't have inside information, I can say unequivocally that
[3:40:36.480 --> 3:40:45.360]  President Trump knows the facts behind what I just said. He knows the name Newstar. He doesn't
[3:40:45.360 --> 3:40:51.040]  say it publicly for whatever reason, but he does say it publicly through his lawsuit filings.
[3:40:51.040 --> 3:40:55.760]  This lawsuit that was filed, we're going to dig into this thing. The lawsuit that was filed and
[3:40:55.760 --> 3:41:00.800]  dismissed, when the lawsuit was filed, they brought President Trump's attorney, Peter Tickton, on the
[3:41:00.800 --> 3:41:08.160]  show. And I told him this was the most consequential lawsuit against the deep state with unbelievable
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:14.960]  information identifying all of the co-conspirators, all the evidences a result of the OIG reports,
[3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:20.640]  and the Durham investigation, all the stuff that we now know publicly over the years of the crimes
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:26.000]  that have been committed in an attempt to overthrow the candidacy and the presidency of Donald Trump.
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:32.480]  Well, President Trump in his lawsuit, when he filed it, 79 references to the company named
[3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:40.160]  Newstar and somebody named Rodney Joffey. Who is Rodney Joffey? Who is Newstar? I want to get a
[3:41:40.160 --> 3:41:45.360]  show of hands right now. How many of you have heard of those names for the first time right now?
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:53.680]  Rodney Joffey and Newstar. President Trump knows that name. President Trump has made allegations
[3:41:53.680 --> 3:42:01.200]  in his lawsuit. And I believe it was a masterful strategy to let his attorneys know that a coup
[3:42:01.200 --> 3:42:06.240]  d'etat has taken place, that he needed to defend himself and our country from that coup d'etat,
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:12.800]  that he shared those documents, that he declassified when he left the White House,
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:19.760]  that those documents, I believe, have circumstantial evidence now. But if the DOJ read that lawsuit,
[3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:25.680]  they read everything written about Newstar, there were no attachments in that lawsuit.
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:32.720]  But the DOJ knew what he had. And I believe that that is the central reason why they busted the
[3:42:32.720 --> 3:42:38.480]  door down of President Donald J. Trump at Mar-a-Lago. And they still continue to threaten to go after
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:44.160]  the documentation that he has that what? That this secret cabal is running a shadow government.
[3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:49.040]  Newstar is absolutely critical. He has the evidence in the documentation. And now it's protected
[3:42:49.040 --> 3:42:53.920]  by attorney by privilege. We'll be back to discuss more right after this.
[3:43:22.240 --> 3:43:28.160]  Turbo Force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself.

[3:47:00.640 --> 3:47:17.920]  World Order. It's Alex Jones. All right, folks, now go with me. I'm posting this segment in a final
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:22.800]  home stretch segment, the final 10 minutes of this segment. I want you to go with me here.
[3:47:22.800 --> 3:47:31.040]  And I want you to feel a sense of us going on the offensive, a masterful move, and I have
[3:47:31.040 --> 3:47:37.360]  all of the evidence to prove it. Now, when I originally read the 108-page lawsuit,
[3:47:37.360 --> 3:47:41.920]  which was filed in March against the Deep State, I read the entire thing. I said,
[3:47:41.920 --> 3:47:46.960]  this is the most consequential lawsuit filed by President Trump outlining everything that's now
[3:47:46.960 --> 3:47:52.320]  out in the public. Of course, the declassified documents from the Senate Select Committee on
[3:47:52.320 --> 3:47:56.720]  Intelligence. I read those transcripts where, you know, CrowdStrike said that they found,
[3:47:56.720 --> 3:48:02.080]  you know, no evidence of Russian exfiltration of the DNC servers, so on and so forth. So,
[3:48:02.080 --> 3:48:08.960]  we piece all that together. And it came together in a 108-page lawsuit filed by President Trump.
[3:48:08.960 --> 3:48:13.600]  And I said, wow, I said, I need to get President Trump's attorney on. And I gave them praise.
[3:48:13.600 --> 3:48:18.560]  And I said, this is amazing. I will be following its progress. But one thing I didn't realize
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:24.000]  until just the other day, Sundance from the conservative treehouse brought this up and
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:29.280]  said, here's an interesting take. He said, and he's a legal expert. He read it. But
[3:48:30.240 --> 3:48:36.160]  all the allegations in that lawsuit bombshell information, especially as it relates to the
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:43.600]  79 references to New Star and Rodney Jaffe. I'll tell you who he is very clearly here
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:50.480]  in the next couple of minutes. But there were no attachments. There was no documentary evidence.
[3:48:50.480 --> 3:48:56.320]  There were basically allegations that required hundreds of citations to prove the allegations
[3:48:56.320 --> 3:49:01.760]  in the lawsuit. And Sundance says, this isn't a lawsuit. It's going to require a tremendous
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:08.240]  number of attachments. And then they started rating the Mar-a-Lago President Trump and
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:13.920]  threatening to raid his other facilities. And that's when he realized, aha, masterful move
[3:49:13.920 --> 3:49:18.960]  by President Trump. Now, feel this. President Trump knows about New Star. He knows about
[3:49:18.960 --> 3:49:23.920]  the grand conspiracy to hijack the internet. He knows about the evidence of him being spied
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:30.880]  upon through this new private internet, private sector internet, New Star being the new private
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:36.480]  sector NSA, this entire system where the secret shadow government has been operating.
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:43.920]  And it was used against him. And he alleged that in the lawsuit. But Sundance said that that lawsuit
[3:49:43.920 --> 3:49:50.560]  was a legal transfer mechanism created by the lawyers because President Trump could have
[3:49:50.560 --> 3:49:56.640]  declassified the documents. He had him in his possession. He let his attorneys know and said,
[3:49:56.640 --> 3:50:01.840]  we need to defend our country and defend me in this effort that they're saying that I'm
[3:50:01.840 --> 3:50:06.720]  committing insurrections on and so forth. But in fact, I'm helping to prosecute against
[3:50:06.720 --> 3:50:12.640]  these criminal conspirators. So he had to share this secret information. Well, the DOJ was tipped
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:18.800]  off to that, that there's no way that any attorney could have typed those 79 references to Dude Star
[3:50:18.800 --> 3:50:24.640]  and all those things in that RICO lawsuit. They could have never have typed that information
[3:50:24.640 --> 3:50:29.600]  unless they had access to very high level secret documentation.
[3:50:29.600 --> 3:50:37.360]  Well, President Trump had to share that with his legal team. And guess what? Ready? Checkmate.
[3:50:37.920 --> 3:50:42.960]  Because right now, we have an FBI that's busting his door down to go get those documents,
[3:50:42.960 --> 3:50:46.720]  of course, that could potentially implicate them in their involvement in this coup d'etat
[3:50:46.720 --> 3:50:51.600]  with the Russian collusion thing. Too much bigger than this, folks. They want to make sure that the
[3:50:51.600 --> 3:50:57.600]  world never finds out about who New Star is, who this new internet is, who are the co-conspirators
[3:50:57.600 --> 3:51:03.440]  that have set this up, fading all the way back to the mid 1990s. President Trump basically
[3:51:04.320 --> 3:51:08.960]  outmaneuvered them, shared it with his attorney when they busted his door down. He immediately
[3:51:08.960 --> 3:51:15.120]  called for a special master who's going to say, okay, these are secret documents.
[3:51:16.080 --> 3:51:20.960]  But they're declassified. President Trump can do that. Should we return these? No, we can't.
[3:51:20.960 --> 3:51:25.920]  This is attorney client work product. President Trump has to hang on to these. These go to the
[3:51:25.920 --> 3:51:30.640]  attorneys. The FBI can't even look at them. And the special master will set them aside.
[3:51:31.200 --> 3:51:35.840]  Checkmate, ladies and gentlemen, not even John Durham can keep those a secret.
[3:51:35.840 --> 3:51:42.720]  As that befo- Shoot, I could have had one of my moderators and myself comb through the evidence
[3:51:42.720 --> 3:51:46.880]  and prosecute all of these conspirators faster than John Durham has.
[3:51:48.080 --> 3:51:53.200]  What is his role in this thing? His role has been to keep everything secret. Although he's
[3:51:53.200 --> 3:52:01.280]  identified this Rodney Jaffe in the Sussman indictment and trial as tech executive number one,
[3:52:01.280 --> 3:52:08.480]  this Rodney Jaffe with the highest level cybersecurity clearance possible. He actually
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:14.880]  facilitated the spying of President Trump's campaign and then the spying of the White House.
[3:52:14.880 --> 3:52:20.880]  And ladies and gentlemen, the manufacturing of evidence about Alpha Bank and President Trump's
[3:52:20.880 --> 3:52:27.920]  connection to the Russians, he manufactured it. How is he able to do that? He's at the head with
[3:52:27.920 --> 3:52:35.280]  patents with Newstar, who is now owned by the way, partly by TransUnion, coincidentally.
[3:52:35.840 --> 3:52:44.400]  But this Newstar company is the new NSA, is the private internet. Another company called the
[3:52:44.400 --> 3:52:54.320]  Analysis Corporation, TAC. The CEO, guess who that was of that corporation. The Analysis Corporation
[3:52:54.320 --> 3:53:01.040]  was run by none other than John Brennan. Then another person named James Comey, who in the
[3:53:01.040 --> 3:53:07.600]  private sector became legal counsel for Lockheed Martin. This entire ball of conspirators have
[3:53:07.600 --> 3:53:12.560]  literally laid the groundwork. Rodney Jaffe, I'm going to tell you this right now. When President
[3:53:12.560 --> 3:53:18.240]  Trump was removed from office with election fraud, he made one other move, not only to take over high
[3:53:18.240 --> 3:53:25.440]  level access of the entire internet. Literally, Obama signed over all of our IP addresses and gave
[3:53:25.440 --> 3:53:31.360]  away our sovereignty and turned it over to the UN. Not only did he do that, they removed the regulatory
[3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:37.840]  body overseeing this. And guess what else? Right after President Trump was removed, Rodney Jaffe
[3:53:37.840 --> 3:53:45.920]  and Newstar, with his co-conspirator Perkins Poy, made an effort to buy the SSL certification
[3:53:45.920 --> 3:53:52.560]  Verisign, essentially. This is what he did. You could go to, let's say, the FISA court,
[3:53:52.560 --> 3:53:59.040]  and you think you're on a secure connection to the FISA court. There's an SSL or a security
[3:53:59.040 --> 3:54:07.440]  lock-in. Verisign verifies both ends that secure. Every single secure connection between you and
[3:54:07.440 --> 3:54:13.600]  let's say Amazon or you and the FISA court, guess who is the middle guy in between all of that
[3:54:13.600 --> 3:54:23.520]  traffic to even the CIA at Amazon AWS, the FBI, the FISA court, internet commerce, guess who the
[3:54:23.520 --> 3:54:30.560]  middle person is? It is, in fact, Newstar as that broker that now owns all the security
[3:54:31.920 --> 3:54:37.040]  connections. You might think that you're on the FISA court. Rodney Jaffe's sitting there with his
[3:54:37.040 --> 3:54:41.200]  headphones on, listening to everything that's being said. Shoot, they don't even need to hack,
[3:54:41.200 --> 3:54:45.600]  you're going straight through him. They've taken over top-level access of the internet.
[3:54:45.600 --> 3:54:52.560]  They took over top-level access of the security connections. President Trump knows this,
[3:54:52.560 --> 3:54:56.880]  and now he has all those top-secret documents protected by attorney-client privilege.
[3:54:56.880 --> 3:55:00.160]  We're going on the offensive, ladies and gentlemen, Mike Lindell right now,
[3:55:00.160 --> 3:55:07.360]  through his partner, Dennis Montgomery. I'm saying as a partner, he owns the most sophisticated
[3:55:07.360 --> 3:55:13.520]  software program that Dennis Montgomery designed. Mike Lindell owns it. God bless his soul. He's
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:17.360]  not just the pillow guy. He's a man that wants to help save our country, and he's assembled a team
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:26.720]  of researchers, of technical experts to provide absolute unequivocal proof, 100% proof, 100%
[3:55:26.720 --> 3:55:34.320]  proof. It's in the court system right now. He's trying to get the state secrets gag order lifted
[3:55:34.320 --> 3:55:40.640]  on Dennis Montgomery's information. Why? Because Dennis Montgomery discovered that there was a hack
[3:55:42.080 --> 3:55:48.480]  into the election. China was involved in that. He has proof of the hack and spying on the
[3:55:48.480 --> 3:55:53.440]  President Trump's campaign, on President Trump's White House. All this information is contained
[3:55:53.440 --> 3:56:00.080]  in 32 gigabytes that Mike Lindell has been entrusted with since January 9th of 2019.
[3:56:00.720 --> 3:56:06.160]  And he's trying to get those state secrets gag orders lifted. It's in the court system,
[3:56:06.160 --> 3:56:10.240]  and I think by early October, a judge is going to decide,
[3:56:10.960 --> 3:56:17.360]  are we to keep this gag order to protect state secrets, or can I even allow state secrets to
[3:56:17.360 --> 3:56:24.240]  be applied where crimes have been committed? Mike Lindell has evidence of crimes against
[3:56:24.240 --> 3:56:29.520]  the United States of America, and that's why they're harassing him. That's why they're taking
[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:36.240]  his phone. That's why, ladies and gentlemen, they're obstructing justice that the FBI,
[3:56:36.240 --> 3:56:40.480]  going after under the justification, they get their court orders. Of course, they get court
[3:56:40.480 --> 3:56:47.360]  orders. They have all the judges with all of their Epstein-style blackmail and collateral. They've
[3:56:47.360 --> 3:56:51.200]  been working on it for years. They have their own private internet. They've been surveilling
[3:56:51.200 --> 3:56:56.800]  Americans. They were surveilling Justice Scalia. Dennis Montgomery has proof of it. They were
[3:56:56.800 --> 3:57:02.400]  surveilling the Supreme Court justices. They have all this collateral. They have control over all
[3:57:02.400 --> 3:57:07.600]  the judges. They're going to get any ruling that they want. Of course, that this private internet
[3:57:07.600 --> 3:57:12.880]  that has been set up by the likes of the cabal, the front face of it, Hillary Clinton, the levitating
[3:57:12.880 --> 3:57:23.680]  biatch, and all of her fine friends like Barack Obama, Susan Rice, all of them using this very
[3:57:23.680 --> 3:57:28.720]  secret system, a private internet that you didn't even know existed. But guess what? We're on the
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:33.440]  offensive. We have proof of it, and we're going to go after them, and we're going to free the world
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:49.680]  from this technocratic cradle to grave. It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year,
[3:57:50.320 --> 3:57:55.120]  and I believe the most powerful, the man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[3:57:55.120 --> 3:58:03.600]  The citizen of a republic, the man in the arena. There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence
[3:58:03.600 --> 3:58:10.160]  of the world. It will never be made again. It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds the
[3:58:10.160 --> 3:58:15.200]  information war against the globalist. This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[3:58:15.200 --> 3:58:21.200]  This is something you want to own. And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war
[3:58:21.200 --> 3:58:26.160]  against the globalist. Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available. They'll sell out very quickly.
[3:58:26.800 --> 3:58:32.800]  Please be part of history, and thank you all for your support. You can go to 1776coin.com,
[3:58:32.800 --> 3:58:38.800]  or you can go to patreoncollectibles.com and secure this coin. There's only 10,000 of this
[3:58:38.800 --> 3:58:46.000]  coin in existence, and it funds the info war. Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt, 1776coin.com.
[3:58:46.000 --> 3:58:52.640]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've
[3:58:52.640 --> 3:58:59.840]  known and what's to come. And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic.
[3:58:59.840 --> 3:59:06.160]  Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe
[3:59:06.160 --> 3:59:12.800]  sound course. There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building
[3:59:12.800 --> 3:59:18.880]  our own society. All we got to do is survive the crash. And right now, we still have time
[3:59:18.880 --> 3:59:25.200]  to prepare. The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero. It's time to convert it
[3:59:25.200 --> 3:59:32.880]  into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready.
