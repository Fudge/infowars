[00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:06.311]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.311 --> 00:00:08.072]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.072 --> 00:00:09.833]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.433]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.974]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:17.156]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:21.257]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:36.806]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are yet again, kicking off another broadcast week.
[00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:40.209]  It is the 9th day of September, 2013.
[00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:48.095]  And we're approaching the 12th anniversary of 9-11 that was used.
[00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:57.142]  If 1776 was the birth date for our republic, if the globalists are successful, you'll be able to mark as the tombstone of our republic of 9-11.
[00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:02.041]  The establishment is holding the Republic under the water.
[00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:10.927]  We've got lungs full of the normally life-giving liquid, but we're not fish so we can't breathe it.
[00:01:10.927 --> 00:01:20.374]  And if we don't resist and climb out of this horse trough that they've got our head crammed into, we will succumb, pass out, turn blue, and die.
[00:01:21.573 --> 00:01:25.455]  And then have our bones picked over by the parasites.
[00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:26.835]  And why do parasites do that?
[00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:29.036]  Well, because they're parasites.
[00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:29.797]  That's what they do.
[00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:32.338]  That's what their instinct directs them to do.
[00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:49.355]  And you have a consortium of private banking syndicates, military industrial complex, big pharma, just a collection of psychopaths, sociopaths, and other miscreants who have been skimming the cream off the top of our free market civilization.
[00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:57.643]  But then they decided to kill the golden goose, the golden goose that laid the golden eggs, and just try to get all the eggs at one time.
[00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:00.179]  Of course, there's really no eggs inside.
[00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.119]  It's the goose that produces them.
[00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:10.763]  But they greedily now are shutting that down because instinctively they don't like the liberty and the prosperity that comes from a free market.
[00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:16.425]  Their instinct is to extinct all competition and shoot their own feet out from under them.
[00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:24.309]  You see that with the deindustrialization programs, the moving the jobs to China and Mexico and India and 160 plus other third world countries.
[00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:31.065]  So, we're going to be breaking all that down today, and the ultra-massive developments in Syria.
[00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:34.567]  I will come back, cover all those developments.
[00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:45.214]  And then in the first hour, I want to open the phones up for members of the media, talk show hosts, magazine writers, political analysts.
[00:02:45.214 --> 00:02:46.875]  I'm always opening the phones up for military.
[00:02:48.016 --> 00:02:49.337]  to call in.
[00:02:49.337 --> 00:03:00.260]  Well, why not open the phones up for media to call in that are listeners and to give us your take on where this serious situation is going.
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:12.084]  And then in the second hour I want to open the phones up for military and the general public to call in and give us your take on what's unfolding here.
[00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:14.605]  Obviously Bashar Assad gave an interview to
[00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:20.911]  Charlie Rose of CBS, and we're going to air a few clips of that.
[00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:25.893]  They've been trying to spin what he said, that he's threatening a new 9-11.
[00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:33.356]  The point he made was, and I got the transcript, that if the Al-Qaeda forces, the rebels, get the chemicals, anything could happen.
[00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:41.520]  But he went on to say, yeah, that also anything could happen militarily against you if you attack us, because my government and the military are not the only players.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.260]  Of course, he's talking about Iran and
[00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:48.492]  The H-word, Hezbollah.
[00:03:48.492 --> 00:03:53.154]  And the media's like, how dare Assad talk about fighting back?
[00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:56.155]  We've only been bringing jihadis into his country for two and a half years.
[00:03:56.155 --> 00:04:01.598]  And we're only trying to pull down Egypt and put Al-Qaeda in charge.
[00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:04.979]  And big deal, the protesters are trying to blow up ships in the Suez Canal.
[00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:12.392]  So they're trying to spin the fact that, well, let's start a war and if he fights back, we'll have to have a bigger war.
[00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:13.673]  Because they know that once U.S.
[00:04:13.673 --> 00:04:31.187]  ships are being attacked, once Israel's being attacked, at least they're making this calculation, that the average American or European will say, well, my country right or wrong, I'm going to get behind this war now, because after all, Basher fired back that dirty rat.
[00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:32.849]  You dirty rat!
[00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.991]  So we're going to be breaking all that down today.
[00:04:35.991 --> 00:04:36.412]  And then,
[00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:46.838]  I want to talk about the Californication of America on the heels of the mayor a few weeks ago announcing an emergency because L.A.'
[00:04:46.798 --> 00:04:47.778]  's collapsing.
[00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:49.319]  And believe me, it is.
[00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.560]  And like rats leaving a sinking ship, they're all invading Austin.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.661]  And it is hell on earth.
[00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:56.302]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.302 --> 00:04:56.682]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:14.407]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:24.716]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless Pure Nano Silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.

[00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:46.059]  For many who are new to silver that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays, our nano-silver soap, and our most popular product, the all-natural nano-silver gel.

[00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:04.222]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:06:04.222 --> 00:06:09.746]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:17.471]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:19.533]  From compulsory state education,
[00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:26.779]  To the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:33.966]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:37.008]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:06:37.008 --> 00:06:42.774]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[00:06:43.474 --> 00:06:44.055]  War.
[00:06:44.055 --> 00:06:45.297]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:06:45.297 --> 00:06:46.658]  Another plane just hit!
[00:06:46.658 --> 00:06:47.720]  State of Mind.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.282]  Because there's a war on.
[00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:50.323]  For your mind.

[00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:06.067]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:07:06.067 --> 00:07:09.890]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.293]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:07:13.293 --> 00:07:16.755]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:07:16.755 --> 00:07:23.380]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.803]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:07:27.443 --> 00:07:38.849]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:43.792]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:07:44.332 --> 00:07:52.455]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[00:07:59.057 --> 00:08:06.199]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:12.301]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[00:08:13.735 --> 00:08:25.945]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:31.030]  Respected journalist Conrad Black writing for the New York Sun.
[00:08:33.314 --> 00:08:35.675]  Over the weekend, I had this to say.
[00:08:35.675 --> 00:08:50.621]  He said, the collapse of American influence recalls the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the fall of France post-World War II.
[00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:55.903]  And I do want to go over some of this article in the next three hours today.
[00:08:57.304 --> 00:09:12.053]  Because you know for the last two and a half weeks I've been saying undoubtedly the fall of the American empire's influence is in full bloom right now.
[00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:21.839]  And the problem is historically that in every case when an empire begins to collapse it will expand large wars
[00:09:24.116 --> 00:09:35.298]  As a political distraction and an attempt to unify the population around primitive mob psychology or militant enthusiasm.
[00:09:35.298 --> 00:09:37.539]  In fact, I've done a study of this.
[00:09:37.539 --> 00:09:42.620]  Empires 100% of the time do this.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.720]  Now, I know what some of you are thinking.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:49.381]  You're going, the Soviet Union didn't launch any attacks in 1991 when they collapsed.
[00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.502]  No, they were already collapsing by the 1970s.
[00:09:55.046 --> 00:09:56.067]  They were already collapsing.
[00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:57.428]  The state was already collapsing.
[00:09:57.428 --> 00:10:04.154]  It had already collapsed the people as an authoritarian instinct to dominate them and collectivize them.
[00:10:05.447 --> 00:10:11.032]  And it was the success of the collapse of the individual and the family that led to the collapse of the state.
[00:10:11.032 --> 00:10:18.780]  And no amount of automation, technocracy, robots are going to be able to hold up the New World Order's tyranny as it destroys the individual.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:28.249]  I mean, they openly say they want to destroy the individual in their white papers, and that somehow computers and robots will allow them to have their final revolution against good people.
[00:10:29.642 --> 00:10:33.544]  See, psychopaths, sociopaths, scum, they are at war.
[00:10:33.544 --> 00:10:36.806]  They have enmity against the good.
[00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:38.567]  And they feed on us.
[00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:39.687]  And they bamboozle us.
[00:10:39.687 --> 00:10:46.090]  And they dumb us down as their instinct drives them towards control.
[00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:54.075]  But the Soviet Union launched multiple wars in Central Africa, in Latin America,
[00:10:55.302 --> 00:11:06.708]  In areas of Asia, in Central Asia, the list goes on and on, in an attempt to bolster public support around the military-industrial complex.
[00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:23.057]  So, if I had to put a date on it, the Soviet Union was really pretty much collapsing from the late 70s on to the mid-80s, and then just officially collapsed when their only engine of production that was left, East Germany, collapsed.
[00:11:24.426 --> 00:11:34.029]  Four or five years before East Germany officially collapsed, when the military and police just stood down and stopped oppressing the people.
[00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:40.471]  The Lives of Others details a true story in retrospective of just one snapshot case.
[00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:46.013]  I suggest you watch it to understand what tyranny is like.
[00:11:46.013 --> 00:11:51.254]  And so, we've now basically entered those waters.
[00:11:51.254 --> 00:11:53.155]  I would liken the United States to
[00:11:56.325 --> 00:12:01.088]  1987, East Germany.
[00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:05.030]  About 1987, East Germany.
[00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.471]  1989's very, very close.
[00:12:07.471 --> 00:12:22.479]  And by the way, the social engineers know all this, and so they have the Homeland Security and the armored vehicles and the checkpoints and George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are bad and libertarians are bad and returning veterans are bad and gun owners are bad and Christians are bad.
[00:12:22.479 --> 00:12:24.740]  Pretty much anybody that knows how to tie their shoelaces.
[00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:33.825]  The only people who aren't bad in the new America are people that just laugh at everything and say, I don't care.
[00:12:33.825 --> 00:12:35.546]  Everything's going to be fine.
[00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:45.308]  I can't tell you how many entertainers I've talked to, how many rock stars I've talked to, how many media people I've talked to who say, listen, I totally agree with what you say behind the scenes.
[00:12:45.308 --> 00:12:48.009]  I've been told shut up.
[00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:50.770]  And I'll be given the big contract.
[00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.031]  In some cases for, I mean, we're talking, let's not exaggerate.
[00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.352]  A hundred million dollars?
[00:12:57.352 --> 00:12:59.954]  Twenty million dollars?
[00:12:59.954 --> 00:13:04.498]  And they're told, you shut up, some of them have already spoken out, and you'll get a new contract.
[00:13:04.498 --> 00:13:09.842]  And folks, they're given a contract six months later when they shut up and sign a contract to shut up.
[00:13:09.842 --> 00:13:16.888]  People are given contracts and told, here's your money to shut up, and by the way, here's your agenda you're supposed to push right now.
[00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:29.654]  And so when I see childlike people make fun of us in the national media, a lot of times I end up talking to them behind the scenes.
[00:13:29.654 --> 00:13:30.415]  They're not childlike.
[00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:31.695]  They've been told to do what they're doing.
[00:13:31.695 --> 00:13:44.101]  But still, some of them, local talk show host, other people, literally are childish and mimic the talking points, thinking they'll get a job with the establishment if they just play patty cake with the official narrative.
[00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:45.642]  Let me explain something.
[00:13:45.642 --> 00:13:48.884]  The official narrative is going down.
[00:13:52.844 --> 00:14:14.652]  The United States as we know it is not going to exist anymore and we better be deciding if we want to have the Republic reborn and prosperity and go back to being a nation or whether we want to just be some third world backwater that supplies Hessian mercenaries for the new EU-UN-NATO world government.
[00:14:14.652 --> 00:14:19.814]  Because the plan is to squeeze us for Agenda 21 to fund the world government
[00:14:21.092 --> 00:14:29.360]  And to use that impoverishment by scientific metric, by scientific actuary, as the tool of political oppression.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:36.167]  Because what they've done is they've just turned it into a science what their tyranny already does.
[00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:39.891]  And again, they all write books, Rand Corporation, you name it.
[00:14:39.891 --> 00:14:42.834]  We've cited them here, I've made films about it, where they admit all this.
[00:14:43.993 --> 00:14:52.040]  And then rationalize it that it's a good thing to do because prosperity is bad for the environment and for the carbon footprint.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:59.887]  But of course not for them with their jet copters and jets and, you know, 15 mistresses and palaces and private islands and red carpets.
[00:14:59.887 --> 00:15:02.389]  No, no, you're not going to have air conditioning.
[00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:03.850]  You're not going to have a car.
[00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.852]  And by the way, you're not even going to have a job.
[00:15:06.232 --> 00:15:15.339]  Because let me give you a little newsflash, all you trendies that have bought into this and go to Whole Foods and buy, you know, the racks are full of magazines about how cool it is to be poor and everything.
[00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:17.120]  Let me explain something to you.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:33.393]  They're bankrupting you and they set up the Rural Affairs Commission under the Pentagon to shut down all independent agriculture and they're going to shut everything off in increments and then carry out basically high-tech red terror operations.
[00:15:33.393 --> 00:15:33.613]  Okay?
[00:15:34.844 --> 00:15:36.405]  You're going to be forcibly inoculated.
[00:15:36.405 --> 00:15:40.966]  You're going to die young of weaponized cancer you've been injected with.
[00:15:40.966 --> 00:15:44.707]  We're already deeply into this program.
[00:15:44.707 --> 00:15:46.588]  And here's a little newsflash.
[00:15:46.588 --> 00:15:49.809]  The Pentagon's listening and they know I'm telling the truth.
[00:15:49.809 --> 00:15:56.751]  And these Pentagon operatives go home and look at their wives and children at night and they know everything I'm saying is dead on accurate.
[00:15:56.751 --> 00:16:03.033]  They're going and being decompartmentalized and looking up what I'm saying and finding out it's all true and connecting the dots.
[00:16:04.735 --> 00:16:05.756]  It's not even connected to the dots.
[00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:11.044]  It's, it's, it's... Like a caller said yesterday, this is painting by colors now.
[00:16:11.044 --> 00:16:12.026]  Or painting by numbers.
[00:16:15.322 --> 00:16:21.044]  Man, I'm sorry reality's really scary and really wild, but here's the good part about reality.
[00:16:21.044 --> 00:16:28.427]  The globalists are flesh and blood just like us, that have built themselves up to this god-like status with our tax money and our energy.
[00:16:28.427 --> 00:16:34.469]  The minute we realize they're predatory enemies, the minute we realize their system's bad for us,
[00:16:35.677 --> 00:16:38.878]  And it's only going to get worse and that it's us or them.
[00:16:38.878 --> 00:16:54.922]  The moment we commit to absolutely do everything we can to sabotage them every day with targets of opportunity in the info war is one step closer to politically pulling that razor's edge across their carotid arteries.
[00:16:56.127 --> 00:16:59.871]  Let me tell you, folks, the New World Order, if you want to use that analogy, is already holding its neck.
[00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:01.413]  We already slit one wide open.
[00:17:01.413 --> 00:17:03.735]  Blood's spraying all over the walls right now.
[00:17:03.735 --> 00:17:10.903]  We need to just dig in, pull it in all the way across, reach into the New World Order, and give them a Colombian necktie.
[00:17:10.903 --> 00:17:11.643]  Okay?
[00:17:11.643 --> 00:17:13.445]  That's what needs to happen, because it's us or them.
[00:17:13.445 --> 00:17:14.486]  You understand that?
[00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:16.809]  This is a death battle, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:16.809 --> 00:17:18.751]  And there's blood spraying all over the walls right now.
[00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:22.221]  But you have to understand, so is ours.
[00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:23.662]  This is a death battle.
[00:17:23.662 --> 00:17:27.124]  We've got, like, hatchets, basically, hacking each other up right now.
[00:17:27.124 --> 00:17:41.456]  And if I can just get the American people and the people of the world to realize how serious this is and trigger our life force, our survival mechanisms, our survival instincts that we all have, you're all weaponized, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:42.977]  Humans are incredible creatures.
[00:17:42.977 --> 00:17:49.102]  If I can get you to turn on your weaponized systems and just admit you're under attack, it's all over, folks.
[00:17:51.277 --> 00:17:53.819]  It's time to go weaponized.
[00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:59.903]  It's time to activate your survival instincts right now, and you gotta do that first to admit we're under attack.
[00:17:59.903 --> 00:18:00.164]  Okay?
[00:18:00.164 --> 00:18:05.387]  And the minute you admit that, you're a cop, you're in the military, you get it, because you understand that.
[00:18:05.387 --> 00:18:14.334]  The general public, though, the minute you go research what I say, no matter how far out it sounds, like science fiction, you're in 2013, folks, and the globalists are 30 years advanced.
[00:18:14.334 --> 00:18:14.694]  It's more like 2050.
[00:18:18.407 --> 00:18:20.390]  2045 in real technological development.
[00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.933]  That's why they're on such power trips.
[00:18:22.933 --> 00:18:27.519]  The minute you become conscious of all of this is the minute we turn the tide.
[00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:32.705]  And by the way, we're at the tipping point right now.
[00:18:32.705 --> 00:18:36.190]  Every analyst that I respect is saying the same thing.
[00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:44.021]  And of course you notice that I've always said our main goal is to collapse the globalist empire because we pay for it.
[00:18:44.021 --> 00:18:49.786]  It's immoral, it's fraudulent, and at its heart it's a eugenicist empire.
[00:18:49.786 --> 00:18:53.949]  They always sell the idea that, oh, this big empire.
[00:18:53.949 --> 00:18:55.530]  They sell to the intelligentsia.
[00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.353]  To the general public they tell you there's no empire, there's no corruption.
[00:18:58.353 --> 00:18:59.734]  They sell the average yuppie.
[00:19:01.377 --> 00:19:05.040]  The average person making $200,000 a year who thinks they're a member of the elite.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:12.307]  That if you buy into all this, and you buy into the corruption, and you buy into the lies, and you buy into, okay, they planted WMDs, but so what?
[00:19:12.307 --> 00:19:13.849]  That's how we get the oil.
[00:19:13.849 --> 00:19:20.355]  We're paying more now than we were back in 2003 for oil, folks.
[00:19:20.355 --> 00:19:23.738]  It's designed so that we don't get cheap oil.
[00:19:23.738 --> 00:19:25.920]  Saddam's crime was selling cheap oil.
[00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:37.260]  And that's just one little microcosm example of how just because you delusionally believe and imagine that you're part of the power structure doesn't make it so.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.702]  And I'm going to talk about that at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:19:41.092 --> 00:19:50.580]  I'm going to talk about how we've been given artificial narcissistic personalities to be programmed and how we can deprogram ourselves.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:56.184]  But first, I'm going to come back and break down the latest bombshell developments on the Syria situation.
[00:19:56.184 --> 00:19:58.346]  But the bigger story is the mass awakening.
[00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:06.320]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.961]  What are bitcoins?
[00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:14.445]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:20:14.445 --> 00:20:16.266]  No bank needed.
[00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:21.950]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.731]  You are in control of your money.
[00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:25.372]  And the best part?
[00:20:25.372 --> 00:20:28.996]  You can start earning and making money with bitcoins right away.
[00:20:28.996 --> 00:20:36.844]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept bitcoins.
[00:20:36.844 --> 00:20:40.548]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros and more.

[00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:03.058]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:21:03.058 --> 00:21:10.627]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?

[00:22:29.878 --> 00:22:31.879]  You've thought about it for years.
[00:22:31.879 --> 00:22:33.599]  Well, the time is now.
[00:22:33.599 --> 00:22:37.040]  You need a secret bunker, and you need it deep and strong.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.741]  Atlas Survival Shelters should be your first and only choice.

[00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.652]  Better prepared than scared.
[00:22:59.652 --> 00:23:02.034]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[00:23:02.034 --> 00:23:15.043]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:18.025]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:23:18.025 --> 00:23:20.206]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[00:23:20.206 --> 00:23:26.628]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:23:26.628 --> 00:23:34.571]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:23:35.211 --> 00:23:40.914]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:23:40.914 --> 00:23:47.798]  To get your Fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[00:23:48.858 --> 00:23:51.120]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:24:00.723 --> 00:24:02.544]  All right, folks.
[00:24:02.544 --> 00:24:03.584]  Alex Jones here.
[00:24:03.584 --> 00:24:04.724]  We're back live.
[00:24:04.724 --> 00:24:16.188]  I'm going to give the number out at the end of this segment and start taking your calls in the next segment, interspersed with
[00:24:30.746 --> 00:24:31.887]  News.
[00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:40.711]  I would like to open the phones up, though, when I do, specifically for radio talk show hosts, writers, people in the media.
[00:24:40.711 --> 00:24:49.775]  What is your take on the collapse of confidence, not only in the Obama administration, but in Congress and in the mainstream media?
[00:24:49.775 --> 00:24:55.158]  And do you disagree with me that this signifies a major tipping point, a sea change?
[00:24:56.823 --> 00:24:58.244]  I mean, it undoubtedly is.
[00:24:58.244 --> 00:25:01.084]  The question is, will this sea change be successful?
[00:25:01.084 --> 00:25:02.845]  In fact, here is the toll-free number.
[00:25:02.845 --> 00:25:05.846]  I'd like to get your take from a media perspective on this.
[00:25:05.846 --> 00:25:06.947]  800-259-9231.
[00:25:06.947 --> 00:25:11.368]  You don't need to say who you are.
[00:25:11.368 --> 00:25:13.069]  You can if you want to.
[00:25:13.069 --> 00:25:18.210]  But I'd rather just, you know, say I'm in radio, I'm in TV, I'm in print, I'm in film.
[00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.131]  Here is my take on this.
[00:25:20.131 --> 00:25:22.592]  But from folks that have actually done something in the media.
[00:25:24.393 --> 00:25:24.573]  800-259-9231.
[00:25:24.573 --> 00:25:26.554]  800-259-9231.
[00:25:26.554 --> 00:25:33.819]  Now the system is counting on ignorance.
[00:25:33.819 --> 00:25:40.982]  That is the ocean in which these tyrants, these leviathans, swim.
[00:25:40.982 --> 00:25:48.166]  But you've got over two and a half years ago the West injecting the rebels that are now committing incredible atrocities against Christians, making them
[00:25:49.437 --> 00:25:51.978]  Convert to Islam or having their heads chopped off.
[00:25:51.978 --> 00:25:54.078]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:25:54.078 --> 00:25:56.419]  Burning Bibles en masse.
[00:25:56.419 --> 00:26:00.020]  Blowing up churches.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:12.564]  And then meanwhile, we've got Obama coming out and saying, hey, I was hired, I was elected to end wars, and I want to end the war in Syria.
[00:26:12.564 --> 00:26:15.645]  Basically the same thing he said last week, war is peace.
[00:26:15.645 --> 00:26:16.165]  That's what he said.
[00:26:18.223 --> 00:26:27.031]  The West, NATO, the U.S., Israel, Saudi Arabia, who's right at the heart of it, bankrolling it.
[00:26:27.031 --> 00:26:28.532]  They're spreading the Sunni Empire.
[00:26:28.532 --> 00:26:38.722]  Nothing against Sunni Muslims, folks, but, you know, it's the majority, it's the group the global is sided with, it's the shock forces, and I do have something against the radical Sunni jihadists in Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:40.294 --> 00:26:46.982]  And some people in the Israeli papers go, well, we're helping knock out our, you know, Iran's ally with our enemy, Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:46.982 --> 00:26:50.786]  Look, come on, Al-Qaeda's been used to attack Israel.
[00:26:50.786 --> 00:26:53.910]  That came out in Haaretz years ago in Jerusalem Post.
[00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:58.835]  And in fake Al-Qaeda attacks, just search that headline, so that you could take Israelis' liberties.
[00:26:59.975 --> 00:27:04.058]  And also, Arabs that live in Israel take their freedoms.
[00:27:04.058 --> 00:27:08.180]  The military-industrial complex, whether it's in Russia or Israel, whether it's in the U.S.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.602]  or South Africa, stands to gain from crises.
[00:27:11.602 --> 00:27:19.107]  And Israel wants a piece of Syria, a lot more than they got with the Golan Heights, and it is despicable.
[00:27:19.107 --> 00:27:24.350]  And I've seen some spin out there that it's anti-Semitic if I don't support
[00:27:26.784 --> 00:27:30.666]  Israel supporting Al Qaeda as a proxy in Syria.
[00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:36.289]  And again, if people in Israel criticize this, they get criticized.
[00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:40.612]  You'll do what the central government says, or you're a racist.
[00:27:40.612 --> 00:27:42.853]  You'll support Obamacare, or you're a racist.
[00:27:42.853 --> 00:27:44.854]  You'll turn your guns in, or you're a racist.
[00:27:44.854 --> 00:27:49.277]  It's the same political correctness, which is really just a weapon.
[00:27:49.277 --> 00:27:53.419]  We're going to call you bad names if you don't go along with this.
[00:27:53.419 --> 00:27:54.640]  Meanwhile, I'm criticized
[00:27:55.836 --> 00:28:03.187]  By the giant other religious group, the anti-Israel crowd, that's a religion, who absolutely see me as the devil.
[00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:10.661]  Because all of their bullying has not made me join them.
[00:28:10.661 --> 00:28:18.086]  I will continue to be credible and really address things geopolitically on how they stand, not on which group I'm in.
[00:28:18.086 --> 00:28:20.908]  I'm in the group that promotes liberty and freedom for all.
[00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:25.492]  I'm in the group that promotes due process and family values and the Second Amendment.
[00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:29.453]  And I believe there are people from every group that support that.
[00:28:29.453 --> 00:28:36.134]  But here is Obama saying he needs to end the war, but nobody points out the war his handlers started.
[00:28:36.134 --> 00:28:36.774]  Here it is.
[00:28:36.774 --> 00:28:42.455]  I was elected to end wars and not start them.
[00:28:42.455 --> 00:28:50.496]  I've spent the last four and a half years doing everything I can to reduce our reliance on military power.
[00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:53.377]  What I also know is that there are times where
[00:28:55.034 --> 00:28:58.916]  We have to make hard choices if we're going to stand up for the things that we care about.
[00:28:58.916 --> 00:28:59.976]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:28:59.976 --> 00:29:01.717]  And that's the same speech he's been giving.
[00:29:01.717 --> 00:29:02.837]  The things we care about.
[00:29:02.837 --> 00:29:06.158]  And he goes on to say, fighting evil.
[00:29:06.158 --> 00:29:07.559]  Assad was attacking nobody.
[00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:09.259]  Assad was westernizing.
[00:29:09.259 --> 00:29:10.560]  Assad was opening up.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.761]  Assad wanted to have resorts there.
[00:29:13.761 --> 00:29:15.102]  He wanted westerners to come.
[00:29:15.102 --> 00:29:16.202]  Assad grew up in England.
[00:29:17.748 --> 00:29:26.774]  Assad was having elections in regional governments, and they used that openness to then come in and destabilize the country.
[00:29:26.774 --> 00:29:31.097]  And then they criticize the country as cracking down, just like they're doing Egypt.
[00:29:31.097 --> 00:29:35.920]  Oh, Egypt, you won't let Al-Qaeda murder all the Christians and all the Jews that live there.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.881]  You're anti-Semitic.
[00:29:37.881 --> 00:29:44.966]  It's amazing that these are such tyrants, but because they're called liberals, it's supposedly okay.
[00:29:44.966 --> 00:29:45.927]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:45.927 --> 00:29:46.327]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.793 --> 00:29:53.724]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:30:01.952 --> 00:30:04.054]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:30:04.054 --> 00:30:12.081]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:30:12.081 --> 00:30:17.006]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:30:17.006 --> 00:30:20.589]  The problem is we can't help everybody, if every one of us who can.
[00:30:20.589 --> 00:30:21.129]  We're good to go.

[00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:43.994]  I'm not knocking people that promote other stuff.
[00:35:43.994 --> 00:35:45.735]  You'll hear some of it here on the network.
[00:35:45.735 --> 00:35:46.195]  That's fine.
[00:35:46.195 --> 00:35:48.976]  I haven't investigated that, but I don't endorse it.
[00:35:48.976 --> 00:35:52.758]  If you hear me endorsing something, I've looked into it and I believe it's excellent.
[00:35:52.758 --> 00:35:55.019]  InfoWarsHealth.com is excellent.
[00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:56.699]  Also, if you go to InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:35:58.717 --> 00:36:00.538]  This is a totally listener-supported transmission.
[00:36:00.538 --> 00:36:04.041]  We don't take taxpayer money like NPR or MSNBC.
[00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:05.903]  Oh, you didn't know they got stimulus money?
[00:36:05.903 --> 00:36:06.203]  No, no.
[00:36:06.203 --> 00:36:11.527]  We're supported with the high-quality shortwave radios we sell that are solar-powered at cost in many cases.
[00:36:11.527 --> 00:36:17.092]  I mean, this is just, there's hardly any profit in some of this stuff because I just have the very best prices.
[00:36:17.092 --> 00:36:19.313]  The Cruiser from Jekyll Island, American Drug War II.
[00:36:20.814 --> 00:36:21.414]  It's all there.

[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.300]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.701]  And your support has made this possible.
[00:36:48.701 --> 00:36:49.281]  And look at how
[00:36:50.672 --> 00:36:58.596]  Infowars and my news operations are always now right at the heart of big breaking news and things that really turn the tide.
[00:36:58.596 --> 00:37:00.076]  And that is a blessing from God.
[00:37:00.076 --> 00:37:01.017]  I am honored.
[00:37:01.017 --> 00:37:03.958]  I am humbled by God's grace.
[00:37:03.958 --> 00:37:11.602]  But by your grace as well, listeners, putting up with me, supporting me, Lord knows, you know, I'm just a man warts and all.
[00:37:13.871 --> 00:37:20.053]  As Lord Nelson once said about himself, he said, I don't know why everybody likes me so much, I'm just a man, warts and all.
[00:37:20.053 --> 00:37:25.054]  But the point is, we're all in this together, and I'm 110% committed to the fight for liberty.
[00:37:25.054 --> 00:37:30.516]  So thank you all for your support, including our local AM and FM affiliates that pick up the broadcast.
[00:37:30.516 --> 00:37:32.737]  Support their local sponsors, or become a sponsor.
[00:37:32.737 --> 00:37:35.758]  Spread the word on however you listen.
[00:37:35.758 --> 00:37:37.338]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:42.800]  Okay, let me just race through some of the headlines, and then I will go back to your calls.
[00:37:45.521 --> 00:37:52.684]  About a year ago, and then again about four months ago, the Russians said, we're at all the chemical weapons bases that every major government in the world has.
[00:37:52.684 --> 00:37:56.666]  Our media plays on ignorance like, we should innovate them, they have chemical weapons.
[00:37:56.666 --> 00:37:59.827]  The United States has more chemical weapons than anybody in the world.
[00:37:59.827 --> 00:38:01.127]  Let's just get that straight.
[00:38:01.127 --> 00:38:01.408]  Okay?
[00:38:01.408 --> 00:38:04.929]  And that means the criminals that have hijacked this nation do.
[00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:09.591]  And so we've got that going on.
[00:38:09.591 --> 00:38:14.233]  So now, Kerry came out and said, you are given one week, this is all over the news,
[00:38:16.266 --> 00:38:18.007]  I say all over the news, why even give a source?
[00:38:18.007 --> 00:38:19.989]  AP, Reuters, LA Times, I've got them all.
[00:38:19.989 --> 00:38:20.789]  The Guardian.
[00:38:20.789 --> 00:38:21.690]  Here's The Guardian.
[00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:27.254]  John Kerry gives Syria week to hand over chemical weapons or face attack.
[00:38:27.254 --> 00:38:29.235]  So now it's a new ultimatum.
[00:38:29.235 --> 00:38:31.276]  Hand over those WMDs, Saddam.
[00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:32.217]  I don't have any.
[00:38:32.217 --> 00:38:34.578]  You sold them to me and then for a decade the U.N.
[00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:36.320]  inspectors have been here and blown them all up.
[00:38:36.991 --> 00:38:42.355]  Doesn't matter, we know you have them hiding in a chicken factory or a turkey processing planter.
[00:38:42.355 --> 00:38:45.257]  Or, they actually said a nuclear reactor was hidden under a rosebush.
[00:38:45.257 --> 00:38:46.678]  Remember that one?
[00:38:46.678 --> 00:38:48.759]  That was on the news.
[00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:52.281]  And then you've got Kerry and everybody saying, we ought to just assassinate Assad.
[00:38:52.281 --> 00:38:55.604]  Notice anybody else does that, you get arrested for plotting murder.
[00:38:55.604 --> 00:38:57.325]  They don't have congressional authorization.
[00:38:57.325 --> 00:38:58.546]  They don't have common law.
[00:38:58.546 --> 00:39:03.309]  It violates international law on its face.
[00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:05.530]  On its face.
[00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:05.671]  And
[00:39:06.496 --> 00:39:09.028]  They're just doing it because they're a bunch of gangsters!
[00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:12.736]  A bunch of gangsters.
[00:39:12.736 --> 00:39:14.838]  And you've got all these interests that want to carve up.
[00:39:14.838 --> 00:39:16.039]  It's very colonial.
[00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:19.421]  Saudi Arabia, Israel, France wants a piece of Syria.
[00:39:19.421 --> 00:39:21.362]  Turkey used to be a colonial power.
[00:39:21.362 --> 00:39:28.007]  The heart of the Ottoman Empire until just about, well, until World War I, I guess 1918, when it collapsed.
[00:39:28.007 --> 00:39:37.394]  And there's just this destabilization by globalist forces to collapse all this real estate and these civilizations to come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:39:37.394 --> 00:39:38.335]  And then Assad
[00:39:39.733 --> 00:39:45.658]  I watched the whole Charlie Rose interview last night.
[00:39:45.658 --> 00:39:53.304]  And Assad says things like, I guess there could be chemical weapons if the rebels get control.
[00:39:53.304 --> 00:39:55.026]  I've got the transcript right here.
[00:39:55.026 --> 00:39:58.429]  And the media is like, Assad threatens chemical attack.
[00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:00.450]  They go, well, will you attack your neighbors?
[00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.831]  He goes, well, it's not just us.
[00:40:02.898 --> 00:40:05.779]  There are other forces in the Middle East that are going to respond.
[00:40:05.779 --> 00:40:07.720]  And yeah, it's going to be bad.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.040]  I.e.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.440]  Hezbollah and Iran.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.261]  And they spin that like Assad is threatening a new 9-11.
[00:40:13.261 --> 00:40:15.702]  And I was listening to the radio this morning, National Radio.
[00:40:15.702 --> 00:40:19.843]  I'm not going to invite somebody, I can't even say who, but you can imagine.
[00:40:19.843 --> 00:40:24.485]  I was going back and forth between NPR and a big national show this early in the morning.
[00:40:24.485 --> 00:40:26.966]  You all probably heard similar stuff.
[00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:29.667]  I saw it on CNN earlier today.
[00:40:29.667 --> 00:40:30.587]  The talking point
[00:40:31.704 --> 00:40:37.249]  The talking point is that, see, he's going to do another 9-11.
[00:40:37.249 --> 00:40:39.431]  Bashir Assad, ladies and gentlemen, is secular.
[00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:46.438]  Bashir Assad has been fighting actual al-Qaeda for two years, nine months.
[00:40:46.438 --> 00:40:47.599]  Keep saying two and a half years.
[00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:49.460]  It's actually more than that now.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.943]  It'll be three years in December.
[00:40:51.943 --> 00:40:54.425]  This stuff all kicked off December three years ago, basically.
[00:40:55.994 --> 00:41:00.157]  And you could go there and stay in a hotel and go to the beach, okay, in Syria.
[00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:02.419]  You could go to the oldest markets in that area of the world.
[00:41:02.419 --> 00:41:04.881]  You could go see Roman and Byzantine ruins.
[00:41:04.881 --> 00:41:09.145]  In fact, I wanted to go to Israel sometime.
[00:41:09.145 --> 00:41:10.165]  I've been to Europe.
[00:41:10.165 --> 00:41:12.387]  I wanted to go to Israel and see that incredible history.
[00:41:12.387 --> 00:41:15.230]  I wanted to then go to Syria.
[00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.792]  I wanted to then go to Rome because I had never been to Italy.
[00:41:17.792 --> 00:41:20.434]  That was a trip I was planning someday, a dream trip.
[00:41:22.415 --> 00:41:23.836]  About Syria, folks.
[00:41:23.836 --> 00:41:27.697]  I mean, they've got Roman ruins better than what they've got in Rome there.
[00:41:27.697 --> 00:41:28.617]  Okay?
[00:41:28.617 --> 00:41:32.219]  I mean, just... In fact, type into Google search engine and click images.
[00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:33.599]  Roman ruins, Syria.
[00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:36.600]  I mean, it is incredible.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.181]  Whole cities just out in the desert.
[00:41:39.181 --> 00:41:44.943]  Columns and buildings and stuff that makes the Parthenon in Greece look like... That's all being blown up right now.
[00:41:44.943 --> 00:41:50.065]  Because the jihadis hate any culture that isn't Saudi Arabian Bedouin or whatever.
[00:41:51.169 --> 00:41:53.210]  They're blowing up some of the oldest churches in the world.
[00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.950]  I don't have to tell you this.
[00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.090]  It's finally on the news.
[00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:58.632]  And they're putting people to the sword that don't join it.
[00:41:58.632 --> 00:42:01.272]  I mean, it is... Look at those ruins.
[00:42:01.272 --> 00:42:02.553]  By the way, they're shelling those.
[00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:07.535]  I saw that this weekend and almost cried.
[00:42:07.535 --> 00:42:10.035]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:42:10.035 --> 00:42:11.036]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:42:11.036 --> 00:42:14.257]  This is making me so sick.
[00:42:14.257 --> 00:42:20.299]  And then it's the tragedy of the ignorance of the public that, yeah, they're waking up, but not fast enough because
[00:42:21.536 --> 00:42:24.538]  Obama says he's got to clean up the war and stop the death?
[00:42:24.538 --> 00:42:33.004]  I mean, this is like Jeffrey Dahmer having a press conference and saying, you know, I need to protect kids in the neighborhood.
[00:42:33.004 --> 00:42:47.674]  And you're like, but you shot video of you killing people and injecting acid in their brains to make them zombie sex slaves, and all these bodies in your refrigerator and drums, and he's sitting there eating a forearm going, what's the big deal?
[00:42:47.674 --> 00:42:49.455]  I mean, they're the authors of it.
[00:42:49.455 --> 00:42:50.656]  They did it.
[00:42:51.872 --> 00:42:57.795]  They're trying to overthrow Egypt right now and trying to put Al-Qaeda in.
[00:42:57.795 --> 00:42:59.456]  Forget Muslim Brotherhood, folks.
[00:42:59.456 --> 00:43:00.277]  I've seen the films.
[00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:03.518]  You've seen the... I mean, it's Al-Qaeda flags.
[00:43:03.518 --> 00:43:05.980]  It's the real deal.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.841]  And this is them going too far.
[00:43:08.841 --> 00:43:12.724]  I mean, will they get away with this is the question.
[00:43:12.724 --> 00:43:16.966]  And by the way, I'll cover this next hour after I take calls and continue with calls.
[00:43:16.966 --> 00:43:20.228]  We do have breaking news on the missing nukes at Daesh Air Force Base.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.741]  Dyeth refuses to deny secret nuke transfer.
[00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:26.122]  We're now six days into this.
[00:43:26.122 --> 00:43:29.243]  It'll be a week tomorrow.
[00:43:29.243 --> 00:43:34.385]  And they have refused on their own Facebook to deny it.
[00:43:34.385 --> 00:43:37.947]  And we've talked to them, I don't know, like six, seven times, videotaped it.
[00:43:37.947 --> 00:43:39.808]  You've seen those videos we put out.
[00:43:39.808 --> 00:43:41.488]  They will not deny it still.
[00:43:41.488 --> 00:43:42.189]  So there you go.
[00:43:42.189 --> 00:43:42.809]  What does that tell you?
[00:43:44.292 --> 00:43:48.255]  Because if they weren't transferring nukes, they'd say, this story is completely erroneous.
[00:43:48.255 --> 00:43:53.279]  I happen to know Lindsey Graham's gotten thousands of calls, they've gotten thousands at Dyess.
[00:43:53.279 --> 00:43:55.501]  We call up and they go, is this about the weapons transfer?
[00:43:55.501 --> 00:43:59.364]  We're like, yeah, well, we'll call you back in a few hours.
[00:43:59.364 --> 00:44:00.465]  And then they never do.
[00:44:00.465 --> 00:44:03.927]  And we call back the next day, you know, you said, Captain, that you were gonna call us back.
[00:44:03.927 --> 00:44:04.468]  No, I didn't.
[00:44:04.468 --> 00:44:07.570]  I never said that.
[00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.371]  Call them back the next day.
[00:44:08.371 --> 00:44:10.172]  I never talked to you.
[00:44:10.172 --> 00:44:11.813]  Yeah, you told us you'd call us back.
[00:44:11.813 --> 00:44:12.234]  No, I didn't.
[00:44:13.404 --> 00:44:14.784]  Well, yeah, we have video of it.
[00:44:14.784 --> 00:44:16.405]  Nope, didn't.
[00:44:16.405 --> 00:44:17.565]  Just unbelievable.
[00:44:17.565 --> 00:44:29.850]  Dias refuses a nice secret nuke transfer, but then we discovered... I mean, I knew about this hiding in plain view, but the Pantex giant nuclear weapons manufacturing and decommissioning facility, the biggest in the United States.
[00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:31.971]  In fact, they say most of it's done there.
[00:44:31.971 --> 00:44:34.591]  I love how it's got guard towers and barbed wire facing in.
[00:44:34.591 --> 00:44:36.192]  Very, very interesting.
[00:44:36.192 --> 00:44:40.173]  My military personnel's sources have said that is a FEMA camp as well.
[00:44:40.173 --> 00:44:41.494]  It's a gigantic facility.
[00:44:43.152 --> 00:44:47.794]  And, uh, you can go look at images of them with warheads.
[00:44:47.794 --> 00:45:01.759]  And I've just been told by sources that don't want to get in trouble that I should look at the Pantex facility and that that's where the nukes came from, that they were just going through Daesh and that something else was being picked up at Daesh.
[00:45:01.759 --> 00:45:09.142]  And that's a separate source than are other sources, but obviously folks can't give you a lot of info when they've signed national security agreements.
[00:45:09.142 --> 00:45:12.003]  You see what happens to whistleblowers, but it is illegal
[00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:18.725]  to just have these things disappear in trucks to South Carolina with Lindsey Graham saying brace for nukes to go off.
[00:45:18.725 --> 00:45:19.926]  But we're going to go to your calls.
[00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:30.830]  We're going to go to Chris, TV producer, Alex, writer, blogger, Ronald's a journalist, Drew's a talk show host, and Julio is listening on 1530 AM WCKG in Chicago.
[00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:35.111]  I know who he is because he's done reporting for us and broken some national news stories.
[00:45:35.111 --> 00:45:38.672]  We're going to get to all of you into the next hour here in just a few minutes.
[00:45:38.672 --> 00:45:39.473]  But first, here is
[00:45:40.936 --> 00:45:51.559]  Bashor with Charlie Rose, Mr. CFR, saying, I didn't do the chemical attack, and by the way, all hell's gonna break loose if you attack us.
[00:45:51.559 --> 00:45:55.701]  I mean, obviously, and then the media's like, oh, he's so threatening.
[00:45:55.701 --> 00:45:58.902]  The West is starting this, folks.
[00:45:58.902 --> 00:46:01.883]  I mean, can I just walk up to somebody on the street, it's done, nothing, break their nose.
[00:46:01.883 --> 00:46:05.584]  The cops get there and I go, you know, after I punched him in the nose, officer, he, uh,
[00:46:06.772 --> 00:46:09.094]  He threatened to punch me back, you know.
[00:46:09.094 --> 00:46:16.622]  I've been punching this guy in the face for almost three years and doing all this and cutting off everything, and now he's threatening to fight back.
[00:46:16.622 --> 00:46:19.464]  I mean, the cops would go, well, you just assaulted him, you're going to jail.
[00:46:19.464 --> 00:46:22.187]  I mean, this is just common law, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:22.187 --> 00:46:24.910]  But instead, the cops go, well, here, let me just shoot him for you.
[00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:25.971]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:46:26.547 --> 00:46:29.729]  And the guy's wriggling on the ground, bleeding to death, and they're like, man, look at him.
[00:46:29.729 --> 00:46:31.351]  His blood is dripping on the ground.
[00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:32.912]  He might give us HIV.
[00:46:32.912 --> 00:46:33.733]  He's a terrorist.
[00:46:33.733 --> 00:46:35.634]  Arrest that dying man.
[00:46:35.634 --> 00:46:41.419]  I mean, it's just, it beggars common sense.
[00:46:41.419 --> 00:46:43.660]  Let's go to a little clip of Basher.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:47.723]  What was the reality on August 21st?
[00:46:47.723 --> 00:46:50.065]  What happened in your judgment?
[00:46:50.065 --> 00:46:54.649]  We're not in the area where the alleged chemical attack
[00:46:55.367 --> 00:46:56.048]  What's happened?
[00:46:56.048 --> 00:46:57.329]  Is it alleged?
[00:46:57.329 --> 00:46:59.312]  We're not sure that anything has been caught.
[00:46:59.312 --> 00:47:09.003]  Even at this date, you are not sure the chemical weapons, even though you have seen the videotape, even though you've seen the bodies, even though your own officials have been there.
[00:47:09.003 --> 00:47:10.424]  I haven't finished.
[00:47:10.424 --> 00:47:14.549]  Our soldiers in another area were attacked chemically.
[00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:15.110]  Our soldiers.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.582]  They went to the hospital as casualties because of chemical weapons.
[00:47:20.582 --> 00:47:30.227]  But in the area where they said the government used chemical weapons, we only had video and we only have pictures and allegations.
[00:47:30.227 --> 00:47:31.127]  We're not there.
[00:47:31.127 --> 00:47:36.229]  Our forces, our police, our institutions don't exist.
[00:47:36.229 --> 00:47:37.990]  How can you talk about what happened?
[00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:39.591]  We don't have evidences.
[00:47:39.591 --> 00:47:41.212]  We're not like the American administration.
[00:47:41.212 --> 00:47:43.893]  We're not social media administration or government.
[00:47:44.668 --> 00:47:46.410]  We are the government that deals with reality.
[00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.992]  When we have evidence, it's good enough.
[00:47:48.992 --> 00:48:00.182]  Well, as you know, Secretary Kerry has said there's evidence that the police saw rockets fired from a region controlled by your forces into a region controlled by the rebels.
[00:48:00.182 --> 00:48:01.883]  Alright, folks.
[00:48:01.883 --> 00:48:10.571]  So what's happening is the Emperor's new clothes, the fact that the Emperor's actually butt naked, is now all coming out.
[00:48:12.372 --> 00:48:21.337]  And at the bottom of the next hour, I'm going to break down exactly how the Emperor's new clothes and that idea is what's controlling our society.
[00:48:21.337 --> 00:48:23.858]  Because the Federal Reserve is not federal.
[00:48:23.858 --> 00:48:25.419]  It is a total fraud.
[00:48:25.419 --> 00:48:28.201]  The globalists do run Al-Qaeda on record.
[00:48:28.201 --> 00:48:30.602]  The globalists did start this war.
[00:48:30.602 --> 00:48:34.004]  The rebels have shot all these videos bragging that they did it.
[00:48:34.004 --> 00:48:35.345]  That's been picked up.
[00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:40.908]  And now National French and Italian TV have interviewed people that were kidnapped by Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:41.932 --> 00:48:43.334]  And held and then ransomed out.
[00:48:43.334 --> 00:48:45.456]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:45.456 --> 00:48:49.941]  Very important story.
[00:48:49.941 --> 00:49:00.092]  And they're saying, no, we were held by them and they bragged that Basher hadn't done it and that the chemical attack was launched by them to bring in the U.S.
[00:49:00.092 --> 00:49:01.253]  and that they were going to win now.
[00:49:03.154 --> 00:49:05.875]  And so Europe is all seeing this now, right now.
[00:49:05.875 --> 00:49:07.716]  Here's the headline on Infowars.com.
[00:49:07.716 --> 00:49:08.596]  Kidnapped teacher.
[00:49:08.596 --> 00:49:12.157]  Rebels said Assad not behind chemical weapons attack.
[00:49:12.157 --> 00:49:21.040]  And the reason that article is so important is that it shows all the other past videos of them launching chemicals and admitting it and everything.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.081]  See, that's the issue.
[00:49:22.081 --> 00:49:31.364]  The system thinks we're so ignorant, they're going to have the rebels brag about this publicly while Charlie Rose and everybody shakes their finger at Assad and says, come on, you know you did it.
[00:49:33.206 --> 00:49:33.806]  It's amazing.
[00:49:33.806 --> 00:49:37.488]  Let's go to this clip of Assad talking about expect everything.
[00:49:37.488 --> 00:49:38.389]  Here it is.
[00:49:38.389 --> 00:49:40.910]  Tell me what you mean by expect everything.
[00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.891]  Expect every action.
[00:49:43.891 --> 00:49:46.233]  Including chemical warfare?
[00:49:46.233 --> 00:49:47.233]  That depends.
[00:49:47.233 --> 00:49:57.838]  If the rebels or the terrorists in this region or any other group have it, it could happen.
[00:49:57.838 --> 00:49:59.479]  I don't know.
[00:49:59.479 --> 00:50:02.561]  I'm not a fortune teller to tell you what's going to happen.
[00:50:04.253 --> 00:50:15.026]  But we'd like to know more, and I think the President would like to know more, and the American people would like to know, you know, if there's an attack, you know, what might be the repercussions, and who might be engaged in those repercussions?
[00:50:15.026 --> 00:50:21.594]  Before the 11th of September, in my discussion with many officials in the United States, some of them are congressmen, I used to say that
[00:50:22.274 --> 00:50:26.959]  Don't deal with the terrorists as playing games.
[00:50:26.959 --> 00:50:28.360]  It's a different story.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.203]  You're going to pay the price if you're not wise in dealing with the terrorists.
[00:50:31.203 --> 00:50:32.364]  So, nobody explained.
[00:50:32.364 --> 00:50:37.269]  We said there's going to be a repercussion of the mistaken way of dealing with it.
[00:50:37.489 --> 00:50:38.109]  All right, there you go.
[00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.989]  Let's stop right there.
[00:50:38.989 --> 00:50:44.591]  He's still, if you read the transcript carefully, saying, you turn this country over to terrorists, there's going to be big problems.
[00:50:44.591 --> 00:50:47.092]  And there's other players in the region, meaning Iran.
[00:50:47.092 --> 00:50:52.093]  We're going to come back and talk to Julio, Drew, Ronald, Alex, Chris, and many others.
[00:50:52.093 --> 00:50:59.035]  We'll take calls from journalists until the bottom of the next hour, then open the phones up for everybody into the third hour.
[00:50:59.035 --> 00:50:59.475]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.723 --> 00:51:04.824]  Are you prepared for disasters, job loss, and uncertain times?

[00:51:30.393 --> 00:51:39.700]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:40.500]  This capitalism?
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:46.665]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:46.665 --> 00:51:50.367]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:06.433]  Alright, I'm going to start going to your phone calls now.
[00:54:06.433 --> 00:54:12.818]  I just got a call during the break from Raymond Teague's wife, who worked with me for a couple of years, and was a good friend of mine.
[00:54:12.818 --> 00:54:19.303]  I had dinner with him just about a month ago, and he told me he didn't know how much longer he was going to live.
[00:54:19.303 --> 00:54:26.088]  He was walking around on a walker, but had had a lot of heart attacks, and had like 40-something stents in his heart, and Raymond died an hour ago.
[00:54:26.957 --> 00:54:32.601]  And then you'd heard him here as a few times on the air, did a lot of amazing stuff in Vietnam, secret stuff.
[00:54:32.601 --> 00:54:40.087]  And then worked for NASA and was in Skylab and Space Shuttle and the Apollo 13 program, the whole Apollo program.
[00:54:40.087 --> 00:54:43.450]  Just a treasure trove of info and Raymond just died an hour ago.
[00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:44.190]  We love you, Raymond.
[00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.172]  We know you're in a better place now, buddy.
[00:54:46.172 --> 00:54:47.573]  It really, really gets to me.
[00:54:47.573 --> 00:54:48.514]  He was such a sweet guy.
[00:54:53.237 --> 00:54:54.178]  Really bums me out.
[00:54:54.178 --> 00:54:56.079]  I tell you, I don't know why it hit me so hard.
[00:54:56.079 --> 00:55:01.703]  I had my great uncle died about a month ago and I liked him and knew him my whole life, hunted with him, hung out with him.
[00:55:01.703 --> 00:55:06.007]  But he was like a kind of a harder guy.
[00:55:06.007 --> 00:55:14.033]  So it's not like Raymond was just a funny, real innocent person.
[00:55:14.033 --> 00:55:17.195]  He wanted me to go, kept inviting me to go camping with him.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.341]  Oh man.
[00:55:23.341 --> 00:55:24.601]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[00:55:24.601 --> 00:55:25.842]  Julio in Illinois.
[00:55:25.842 --> 00:55:29.064]  I think all the kids the globalists are killing right now in Syria, folks.
[00:55:29.064 --> 00:55:32.246]  At least Raymond has kids and everything and had a good life.
[00:55:32.246 --> 00:55:33.927]  Julio in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:55:33.927 --> 00:55:36.449]  Go ahead.
[00:55:36.449 --> 00:55:43.373]  My condolences to your loss and Raymond's family and Lord willing he's in a better place.
[00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:45.815]  Alex, it's crazy times we're living in, my friend.
[00:55:45.815 --> 00:55:47.776]  It truly is.
[00:55:47.776 --> 00:55:50.858]  And with what's going on with the Syria conflict,
[00:55:51.298 --> 00:56:10.502]  From a media perspective, it's quite fascinating to see the large public outcry in this internet age we're living in that so many people, not just in Europe, but here in the U.S., are very animate against this on both sides of the political spectrum, and the media
[00:56:11.226 --> 00:56:13.507]  From corporate media to the alternative media.
[00:56:13.507 --> 00:56:20.369]  Well, the alternative media really forced corporate media, with your hard work and others, to really shine a light on this issue.
[00:56:20.369 --> 00:56:24.790]  To admit, yes, that Al-Qaeda is actually being funded by the United States.
[00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:28.351]  And now it's on Face the Nation and everywhere.
[00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:30.252]  Actually, there isn't proof.
[00:56:30.252 --> 00:56:32.572]  We don't know who did the chemical stuff.
[00:56:32.572 --> 00:56:34.473]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:56:34.473 --> 00:56:35.973]  That's why I want to talk to media folks.
[00:56:35.973 --> 00:56:38.074]  What is your take on the sea change?
[00:56:38.074 --> 00:56:39.054]  How big is it?
[00:56:39.054 --> 00:56:40.835]  And how do you expect the empire to strike back?
[00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:43.351]  It's huge, Alex.
[00:56:43.351 --> 00:56:44.932]  It's a total game-changer.
[00:56:44.932 --> 00:56:51.837]  You know, with Libya, it was kind of the first push to where we are currently, but it's a total game-changer.
[00:56:51.837 --> 00:56:56.461]  It's like a slap in the face, really, or a pie in the face to these corporate media outlets.
[00:56:56.461 --> 00:56:58.082]  And it's not just on this issue.
[00:56:58.082 --> 00:56:59.663]  It affects everything.
[00:56:59.663 --> 00:57:01.465]  It's not even a game-changer.
[00:57:01.465 --> 00:57:03.126]  It's a sport-changer.
[00:57:03.126 --> 00:57:04.046]  The sport of life.
[00:57:04.046 --> 00:57:06.608]  I mean, it is a global, total shift.
[00:57:06.608 --> 00:57:07.129]  I'm telling you.
[00:57:08.436 --> 00:57:11.877]  And what I think is coming up next, I think the U.S.
[00:57:11.877 --> 00:57:13.237]  is on high alert.
[00:57:13.237 --> 00:57:14.778]  And I'm not just saying this.
[00:57:14.778 --> 00:57:21.159]  This is through a Texas Fusion Center document from the Texas Department of Homeland Security.
[00:57:21.159 --> 00:57:23.860]  They're talking about a potential threat.
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:30.701]  The FBI this month, or a couple months ago, released an aviation alert for potential attacks.
[00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:31.962]  They're throwing this out there.
[00:57:31.962 --> 00:57:37.603]  And quickly on the nukes thing, you talked about what happened with your sources about nuke transfers.
[00:57:38.323 --> 00:57:49.372]  I'm reading a document from the Department of Defense that was updated August 15th of 2013, and it's the Department of Defense Transportation of U.S.
[00:57:49.372 --> 00:58:01.281]  Nuclear Weapons, and it's a brand new update on how you should safely transport nuclear weapons, and it mentions that all nuclear weapon transportations throughout the U.S.
[00:58:01.941 --> 00:58:13.029]  He has to get approval from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, so maybe that's another lead for you, Alex, to look into what's going on with your sources down in Texas with the nuke transfers.
[00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:16.571]  No, that's why they're freaking out.
[00:58:16.571 --> 00:58:17.732]  They didn't see any paperwork.
[00:58:17.732 --> 00:58:19.573]  It was just the base commander.
[00:58:19.573 --> 00:58:22.956]  And then now we're six days in, and we call them on air.
[00:58:22.956 --> 00:58:26.118]  We've been releasing these videos where we tape it, and they will not deny it.
[00:58:27.233 --> 00:58:33.336]  And then you got Lindsey Graham saying brace for atomic attack in South Carolina if we don't attack Syria.
[00:58:33.336 --> 00:58:36.598]  I mean, it's so obvious who's terrorizing people.
[00:58:36.598 --> 00:58:38.719]  Thank you, Julio, Drew, Ronald, Alex, and others.
[00:58:38.719 --> 00:58:43.441]  We're coming up.
[00:58:43.441 --> 00:58:47.183]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:53.587 --> 00:59:55.972]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.972 --> 00:59:58.737]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:10.198]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.198 --> 01:00:11.779]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.521]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:21.583]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.186 --> 01:00:45.230]  We're now into hour number two, and the whole fraud that is the move to expand the war and the war crimes in Syria, it is all disintegrating right now.
[01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:47.711]  The question is, how will the empire strike back?
[01:00:47.711 --> 01:00:57.035]  How does the collapse in confidence in the government, in the kleptocratic, eugenics-based institutions, and in the Decepticon media
[01:00:58.308 --> 01:01:01.190]  The vomit-supporting media.
[01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:05.874]  How is that going to play out?
[01:01:05.874 --> 01:01:16.283]  The only reason CNN and all the rest of them are having to admit now that the Al-Qaeda is killing Christians and that it's a very immoral war is because they need to keep some confidence they have left in the public.
[01:01:16.283 --> 01:01:18.865]  But it's already gone.
[01:01:18.865 --> 01:01:21.687]  That song already played.
[01:01:21.687 --> 01:01:24.530]  And I'm looking at all the angles.
[01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:25.650]  They've known this is coming.
[01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:35.321]  Brzezinski's written about it the last few years, and he's one of the top strategists the globalists have right now, that their answer is going to be an iron fist.
[01:01:35.321 --> 01:01:38.283]  Staged stuff, it won't matter if we know they staged it.
[01:01:38.283 --> 01:01:43.887]  They'll still just kind of act like, well, we're doing this for your safety, even though everybody knows that's not the case.
[01:01:43.887 --> 01:01:49.610]  That little bit of plausible deniability they think will keep people from speaking out against the system.
[01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:52.672]  And I'm sorry, I don't think that's going to work.
[01:01:52.672 --> 01:01:55.954]  Especially when the military and police that I talk to are really waking up.
[01:01:57.421 --> 01:02:09.510]  Because as bad as the federalization of police is, and as bad as the brainwashing they're being given is, it's actually backfired in many areas.
[01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:19.498]  And that's why I'm reticent to just come out and demonize the police, especially the military, even though they are the instruments the globalists want to use to oppress us.
[01:02:21.656 --> 01:02:28.201]  And Enslave Us, that is the group that I see statistically waking up faster than anybody.
[01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:33.626]  So to a great extent, our hope lies in them, but also our doom.
[01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:34.967]  And that's kind of how it always is.
[01:02:34.967 --> 01:02:37.549]  It's like America's the best of times, the worst of times.
[01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:39.951]  The best of places, the worst of places.
[01:02:39.951 --> 01:02:45.475]  We do have a special destiny, that's clear, as the founders knew and those before them.
[01:02:45.475 --> 01:02:46.216]  And the question is,
[01:02:47.526 --> 01:02:48.787]  What is that special destiny?
[01:02:48.787 --> 01:02:56.234]  Well, the destiny of the world, to a great extent, will be decided here in America.
[01:02:56.234 --> 01:02:59.297]  The New Jerusalem, as the establishment sees it.
[01:02:59.297 --> 01:03:05.183]  Israel is not seen by the high-level Illuminati as the real center of the world.
[01:03:05.183 --> 01:03:06.224]  It's the United States.
[01:03:07.509 --> 01:03:11.051]  And it goes back to the Rosicrucians and others over 500 years.
[01:03:11.051 --> 01:03:14.754]  I don't want to get off into a bunch of esoteric stuff.
[01:03:14.754 --> 01:03:28.042]  Whether you believe in all this or not, America's secret destiny is to bring in a new age of enlightenment and human empowerment.
[01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:33.406]  Now, that's what one group thought, the group that wore the white hats, whether you think they were devils or not.
[01:03:35.014 --> 01:03:42.173]  The Black Magic crew that's always operated within the Illuminati and is the Illuminati
[01:03:43.456 --> 01:03:49.699]  They just want to create absolute hell on earth and think they're going to be gods over some dark kingdom.
[01:03:49.699 --> 01:03:51.280]  Now, I've said enough.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.622]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to go directly to Drew, Ronald, Alex and Chris.
[01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:55.602]  You just joined us.
[01:03:55.602 --> 01:04:01.185]  I want to hear from media people, journalists about the shift we've seen, where they think things are going.
[01:04:01.185 --> 01:04:07.289]  Do you agree with Conrad Black out of the New York Sun?
[01:04:07.289 --> 01:04:11.631]  Collapse of America influence recalls disintegration of Soviet Union fall of France.
[01:04:13.064 --> 01:04:16.867]  And you read this article, it's absolutely dead on, folks.
[01:04:16.867 --> 01:04:22.191]  Again, you notice you've heard me saying this, really for years, but the last three weeks intensely.
[01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:25.213]  And I'm not like tooting my horn going, see I told you!
[01:04:25.213 --> 01:04:29.376]  Now other pundits are agreeing, other analysts are agreeing with me.
[01:04:29.376 --> 01:04:37.462]  This is like, again, seeing the sun come up in the morning and saying, that's the sun.
[01:04:37.462 --> 01:04:41.645]  I'm pointing out what is hiding in splendorous,
[01:04:42.662 --> 01:04:45.565]  Plain view.
[01:04:45.565 --> 01:04:52.073]  And good people better get active, or we're gonna get, as the hippies used to say, radioactive.
[01:04:52.073 --> 01:04:56.899]  Because when the globalists start losing control, they do one thing, and that's start wars.
[01:05:00.979 --> 01:05:04.560]  Every three seconds, someone becomes a victim of identity theft.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.681]  We also hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on U.S.
[01:05:08.681 --> 01:05:09.461]  citizens.
[01:05:09.461 --> 01:05:13.882]  It is now more important than ever to protect yourself and your information on the web.
[01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:20.844]  PrivateInternetAccess.com is a virtual private network service that can encrypt your internet connection while hiding your IP address.

[01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:35.577]  PrivateInternetAccess.com is an American company that understands you need to protect your inalienable rights.

[01:06:01.141 --> 01:06:06.006]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[01:06:06.647 --> 01:06:10.450]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:13.873]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[01:06:13.873 --> 01:06:17.336]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[01:06:17.336 --> 01:06:23.961]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:06:23.961 --> 01:06:27.384]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:06:28.024 --> 01:06:39.430]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:44.393]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.

[01:07:00.652 --> 01:07:04.513]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:07:04.513 --> 01:07:10.035]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:07:10.035 --> 01:07:17.757]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:07:17.757 --> 01:07:26.880]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:34.229]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:07:34.229 --> 01:07:37.133]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:07:37.133 --> 01:07:44.021]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[01:07:44.622 --> 01:07:45.584]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:07:45.584 --> 01:07:46.886]  Another plane just hit!
[01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:06.759]  Big Brother.
[01:08:06.759 --> 01:08:08.540]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:10.301]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.301 --> 01:08:11.882]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.882 --> 01:08:13.443]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.443 --> 01:08:17.626]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:21.789]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:26.832]  Alright, if you just joined us, we're now into the second hour here today.
[01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:29.654]  Huge developments in the economy.
[01:08:29.654 --> 01:08:30.555]  But the police state
[01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:37.364]  With the program of Ploward and Piven to bankrupt America, to collapse everyone under government control.
[01:08:38.886 --> 01:08:44.029]  We've got big Benghazi developments, whistleblowers saying I've been punished for speaking out.
[01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:47.470]  Monsanto's got a plan to get rid of GMO labeling worldwide.
[01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:49.411]  And we're going to be getting into that.
[01:08:49.411 --> 01:08:52.913]  Also, a story I saw yesterday that really made me upset.
[01:08:52.913 --> 01:08:58.496]  We've got it linked up on InfoWars.com out of the Washington Post.
[01:08:58.496 --> 01:09:00.897]  And it's something I've been aware of for a very long time.
[01:09:00.897 --> 01:09:05.440]  And I'm going back to your phone calls, but I need to get to this at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.581]  And it's a long investigative report.
[01:09:09.952 --> 01:09:15.216]  On how in the state of Maryland, in the counties, they actuary it out.
[01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:22.483]  And I discovered this myself in Travis County, and it literally is one reason I have so much rage and am so hateful.
[01:09:22.483 --> 01:09:28.568]  If you watch early videos, when I first got on AXS TV, I was very gentlemanly, friendly, sounded like a country bumpkin.
[01:09:31.227 --> 01:09:32.987]  Never really got mad or upset.
[01:09:32.987 --> 01:09:36.008]  And then over the years, I turned into what I am now.
[01:09:36.008 --> 01:09:44.310]  Watching CPS take families' kids for no reason, and the families literally crawling around on the ground in pain and horror.
[01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:53.033]  I discovered, and we did pieces on this, I know Mike Hanson's got them, he's digging through them, we've been trying to get them up online.
[01:09:53.033 --> 01:09:57.834]  We discovered that they would mainly do it to old people, and they somehow had a database through the health department,
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:20.194]  This is on record, where when old people went in to get colon cancer surgery or lung cancer surgery, whatever the case was, they would suddenly put them into the county's process of taking their property for unpaid property taxes.
[01:10:20.194 --> 01:10:22.135]  And we would go discover they were even paid up!
[01:10:24.244 --> 01:10:34.355]  And then they had realtors and people that would actually death threat us with the police in special units that were involved stealing the property when we would try to go defend them.
[01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:38.359]  And I mean, we have a bunch of these reports.
[01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:41.002]  And then I really discovered when they tried it with my grandparents.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.801]  Okay.
[01:10:42.801 --> 01:10:47.703]  Right after my grandfather had a heart attack and got back from the hospital, then they started up the property tax stuff.
[01:10:47.703 --> 01:10:49.164]  And my grandmother's like, but it's paid.
[01:10:49.164 --> 01:10:50.765]  Can you help me, son?
[01:10:50.765 --> 01:10:58.429]  And then I found, and I had all these hundreds of old people calling me just in Austin alone because I would cover this.
[01:10:58.429 --> 01:11:04.173]  And now it's all admitted how they would take people's houses for as little as $44 unpaid.
[01:11:04.173 --> 01:11:09.876]  But the big issue is they discovered, especially in Baltimore,
[01:11:13.362 --> 01:11:18.766]  That the people had actually paid, and they were taking them, and that it was old people.
[01:11:18.766 --> 01:11:20.007]  They were preying on old people.
[01:11:20.007 --> 01:11:21.548]  And let me tell you something, folks.
[01:11:21.548 --> 01:11:37.660]  When Christ talks about, suffer the little children, it'd be better for you to tie a giant boulder around your neck and throw yourself into the ocean, than to hurt one of these, because vengeance is mine, I will come after you.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.003]  That's, as I learn more and more, that's how the whole New World Order operates.
[01:11:43.624 --> 01:11:48.868]  And that what I thought was only going on in Austin is going on all over the country.
[01:11:48.868 --> 01:11:50.069]  Can you imagine?
[01:11:50.069 --> 01:11:54.272]  And it turns out it's the city and county people who go and buy the houses themselves.
[01:11:54.272 --> 01:11:56.994]  That's why they won't announce the auctions we discovered too.
[01:11:56.994 --> 01:12:04.020]  And you'll show up and it's county employees at the little auction that they won't even publish in a newspaper like they're supposed to do.
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:11.626]  And it turns out like these county people, some of them are worth, here in Austin, tens of millions of dollars and own 20, 30, 40 houses because they steal them!
[01:12:13.991 --> 01:12:16.913]  And they all need to be executed, in my view.
[01:12:16.913 --> 01:12:17.954]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:12:17.954 --> 01:12:26.340]  You take old... and it gets into it in the Washington Post, but whitewashes it, like the feds are doing something about it.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:32.265]  They're probably only doing something about it because the locals are getting a little too greedy and it's getting a little obvious.
[01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:42.132]  But can you imagine taking somebody's house for $44, or they've actually paid the unconstitutional property tax, the surf tax, and you still take their property?
[01:12:45.109 --> 01:12:50.133]  And I'll tell you why I don't like people calling in and thanking me and saying I'm a great guy.
[01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:58.139]  At a subconscious level, and I'm going to your calls, I feel like I'm not articulate enough, I'm not doing enough for these people.
[01:12:58.139 --> 01:13:08.186]  And then I get very hateful towards the general, selfish, narcissistic public that are only into themselves or what their skin looks like or, you know, do they have the fanciest car.
[01:13:08.186 --> 01:13:11.469]  Not that any of that's bad to have a fancy car or whatever, but they worship that.
[01:13:11.946 --> 01:13:16.730]  Meanwhile, there are innocent people being abused, foster children, old people.
[01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:18.631]  You want to know how evil the system is?
[01:13:18.631 --> 01:13:22.415]  Look at what they do to the weak.
[01:13:22.415 --> 01:13:25.677]  And then you see government always claiming they care about the children.
[01:13:25.677 --> 01:13:27.298]  That's why they want to attack Syria.
[01:13:27.298 --> 01:13:30.901]  And then they're behind the nerve gashing, clearly.
[01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:33.644]  And then the worst part is the psychopaths that are doing all the abuse.
[01:13:35.353 --> 01:13:46.916]  And their sociopathic camp followers and their narcissistic camp followers will do anything for what they perceive as success because they're so deeply unfulfilled and insecure.
[01:13:46.916 --> 01:13:51.758]  They just go around like a scourge abusing everyone and no one can stop them.
[01:13:51.758 --> 01:13:56.179]  In fact, I learned the main reason I got thrown off local radio when I had the number one show in the time slot.
[01:13:56.179 --> 01:13:59.200]  Of course, we got back on local radio soon after on another station.
[01:14:00.106 --> 01:14:14.370]  Was because the city got real upset and actually started threatening the general manager because I was having people on every week and stopping groups of predator realtors and groups of police that worked with them.
[01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:19.612]  By the way, I found out about this because Austin Police, good cops, told me about it in 1997.
[01:14:23.627 --> 01:14:25.529]  Actually brought envelopes up to the station.
[01:14:25.529 --> 01:14:28.332]  They said, yeah, a cop was just here in plain clothes.
[01:14:28.332 --> 01:14:29.513]  He wants you to have this envelope.
[01:14:29.513 --> 01:14:33.777]  And I'm like, go look at this old guy having his house taken.
[01:14:33.777 --> 01:14:35.959]  This city council member is involved with this realtor.
[01:14:35.959 --> 01:14:37.340]  I didn't know what this was.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:47.851]  And I learned the cops told me about it because they had special cops who were involved who would be involved with the constables and others in harassing these people.
[01:14:48.371 --> 01:14:54.333]  I mean, they would take, you know, say, a half-million dollar house that some old World War II vet built himself in 1947.
[01:14:54.333 --> 01:14:57.793]  I mean, that's a real case I just mentioned.
[01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:59.674]  Rolling Dellingston.
[01:14:59.674 --> 01:15:00.534]  And stuff like that.
[01:15:00.534 --> 01:15:02.755]  I mean, it makes me want to throw up.
[01:15:02.755 --> 01:15:04.315]  And I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:15:04.315 --> 01:15:08.496]  It's just that I know all this is going on, okay?
[01:15:08.496 --> 01:15:15.498]  And I just get enraged that people aren't doing anything about this.
[01:15:15.498 --> 01:15:15.718]  Okay?
[01:15:17.376 --> 01:15:24.444]  And if anybody needs to be in prison, it's the type of people doing this.
[01:15:24.444 --> 01:15:26.566]  And that's why the tax system is so evil.
[01:15:26.566 --> 01:15:31.891]  Any big tax system will always get taken over by criminals and will be used to rob folks.
[01:15:31.891 --> 01:15:32.452]  They do it.
[01:15:32.452 --> 01:15:35.135]  Instead of robbing banks, folks, they rob old people.
[01:15:36.348 --> 01:15:43.652]  And the health department creates and opens a case on any group of old people that they believe can't take care of themselves.
[01:15:43.652 --> 01:15:46.233]  That is a message that then goes out.
[01:15:46.233 --> 01:15:54.198]  They send out a realtor who looks at the property and then they start a move with elder care and stuff to have them thrown in a nursing home.
[01:15:54.198 --> 01:15:58.900]  Then they'll put in fake paperwork thinking the family isn't going to pay attention.
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:15:59.901]  And then they get the house.
[01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:05.992]  I feel like turning this desk over right now, folks.
[01:16:05.992 --> 01:16:11.837]  And maybe something's wrong with me that I feel very violent when I have flashbacks to this stuff, okay?
[01:16:11.837 --> 01:16:14.539]  I mean, I literally have flashbacks.
[01:16:14.539 --> 01:16:17.782]  I'm gonna be honest with people to CPS grabbing people's kids in front of me.
[01:16:18.502 --> 01:16:22.084]  And seeing old people crying as their house is taken.
[01:16:22.084 --> 01:16:24.485]  And the fact that no one's going to help them.
[01:16:24.485 --> 01:16:25.566]  You understand that?
[01:16:25.566 --> 01:16:27.727]  No one's going to help the Syrian Christians.
[01:16:27.727 --> 01:16:29.287]  No one's going to help anybody but us.
[01:16:29.287 --> 01:16:32.329]  It's up to us to get angry and do something about this.
[01:16:32.329 --> 01:16:35.130]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:36.651]  I'm sick and tired of it.
[01:16:36.651 --> 01:16:42.774]  I'm sick and tired of gangs and bullies in government and corporations teaming up to hurt good people.
[01:16:42.774 --> 01:16:46.216]  And it's because America became gullible and trusting that we've gotten in this position.
[01:16:48.723 --> 01:16:52.045]  America became gullible and trusting, and oh, our government's good.
[01:16:52.045 --> 01:16:54.067]  Remember, the old-timers said, don't trust the government.
[01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:55.888]  The old-timers said, don't take help from the government.
[01:16:55.888 --> 01:16:57.910]  The old-timers said, you stay off my land.
[01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:00.912]  Because they knew, folks, they had common sense.
[01:17:00.912 --> 01:17:02.153]  That's why this country was freer.
[01:17:02.153 --> 01:17:04.935]  And it's time we start acting like that again!
[01:17:04.935 --> 01:17:09.978]  It's time we start standing up for our families, and standing up for each other.
[01:17:09.978 --> 01:17:15.042]  Instead of getting off on, you know, cozying up to these government bureaucrats who are our enemies.
[01:17:15.042 --> 01:17:17.484]  They're a bunch of criminals, folks, I'm telling you right now.
[01:17:18.049 --> 01:17:20.410]  Let's go to your calls, Drew, Roland, Alex, Chris.
[01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:25.731]  We're taking calls from media on their take on the paradigm shift that's happened, or do you disagree with me on that?
[01:17:25.731 --> 01:17:27.932]  Drew in South Carolina, talk show host.
[01:17:27.932 --> 01:17:29.152]  Drew, give us your take on this.
[01:17:29.152 --> 01:17:30.792]  Thanks for calling in.
[01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:31.733]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:31.733 --> 01:17:36.114]  I gotta say, the mood down here in Charleston is a little tense right now.
[01:17:36.114 --> 01:17:39.375]  The local media is not covering any of Lindsey Graham's comments.
[01:17:39.375 --> 01:17:40.135]  It's all coming out of
[01:17:40.994 --> 01:17:43.697]  I got people telling me that Lindsey Graham didn't say that.
[01:17:43.697 --> 01:17:44.778]  That's how shut down the story is.
[01:18:01.853 --> 01:18:03.154]  Definitely a big shift.
[01:18:03.154 --> 01:18:09.276]  I think the biggest awakening now is people are finally getting through the realization that the government doesn't have their best interest in mind.
[01:18:09.276 --> 01:18:10.757]  For so long it was, well, how can they hurt us?
[01:18:10.757 --> 01:18:11.817]  They actually care about us.
[01:18:11.817 --> 01:18:14.438]  Now people are saying that they are evil.
[01:18:14.438 --> 01:18:17.699]  I think that's what's waking a lot of people up.
[01:18:17.699 --> 01:18:20.400]  No, I agree with you.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.522]  What are the mood of the callers that call into your radio show?
[01:18:23.522 --> 01:18:24.122]  What are they saying?
[01:18:25.473 --> 01:18:27.034]  Um, it's a little tense.
[01:18:27.034 --> 01:18:32.595]  A lot of people are just having issues wrapping their head around that the government is behind all this, that they are doing it.
[01:18:32.595 --> 01:18:33.736]  They're starting to come around to it.
[01:18:33.736 --> 01:18:35.636]  They're starting to see that they can't trust the government.
[01:18:35.636 --> 01:18:41.618]  And I think that's the biggest awakening we're seeing with people is that once that cloud gets lifted and they say, okay, now I can't trust it.
[01:18:41.618 --> 01:18:43.018]  Yeah, I can see how they can do this.
[01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:48.000]  I see that they're coming at me and that, you know, they really do understand that it's what we're up against.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:57.483]  You know, that's what's interesting historically is that generally things happen incrementally and then suddenly the bottom falls out and suddenly everybody goes, wow, how did I not see that before?
[01:18:57.483 --> 01:19:01.324]  Like the allegory of the sunglasses and they live.
[01:19:01.324 --> 01:19:06.806]  What do you think the power structure is going to do now that there's a mass awakening happening?
[01:19:06.806 --> 01:19:09.367]  Honestly, I'm scared because they're like a caged animal.
[01:19:09.367 --> 01:19:10.487]  You're backing them into a corner.
[01:19:10.487 --> 01:19:14.348]  I think we're entering the most dangerous days because they're going to be backed up against the wall.
[01:19:14.348 --> 01:19:16.009]  They're going to have to go for broke.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:22.466]  They see their plans falling apart in front of their eyes, and I think they're going to go for that Hail Mary.
[01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:26.550]  I agree with you, and the police and military better decide whose side they're on.
[01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:31.335]  And I'll tell you, from what I've seen, they've decided they're on their own side, the American people's side, common sense's side.
[01:19:31.335 --> 01:19:37.221]  The problem is, the globalists have special units of mercenary criminals that will do anything.
[01:19:37.221 --> 01:19:38.842]  That will do anything.
[01:19:38.842 --> 01:19:40.144]  How do folks find your show, Drew?
[01:19:41.594 --> 01:19:42.455]  We can sit and spin.
[01:19:42.455 --> 01:19:43.875]  It's on KineticHiFi.com.
[01:19:43.875 --> 01:19:44.756]  We're internet radio.
[01:19:44.756 --> 01:19:46.017]  We're alternative media.
[01:19:46.017 --> 01:19:47.397]  Just trying to get the truth out there.
[01:19:47.397 --> 01:19:47.778]  Good job.

[01:22:30.869 --> 01:22:35.351]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.351 --> 01:22:41.073]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.073 --> 01:22:43.234]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.

[01:24:33.972 --> 01:24:35.695]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:24:35.695 --> 01:24:37.938]  Ronald in Texas says he's a journalist.
[01:24:37.938 --> 01:24:42.685]  I want to get, again, if you just joined us, media people's take on what they see happening.
[01:24:42.685 --> 01:24:45.629]  Do you agree with me that we're seeing a major sea change?
[01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:48.453]  And if so, how do you think the establishment's going to respond?
[01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:52.040]  Actually, yes I do.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:57.303]  Now, I've been awake since I was in the Special Forces back in the mid-80s.
[01:24:57.303 --> 01:25:02.107]  I've seen so much of what we were pulling that it was an eye-opener.
[01:25:02.107 --> 01:25:11.854]  Then later, becoming a journalist, I realized you can't work as a journalist for anyone other than yourself if you want to tell the truth.
[01:25:11.854 --> 01:25:15.236]  Because the mainstream media doesn't want it.
[01:25:15.236 --> 01:25:16.878]  And it's funny, due to the fact that here,
[01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:21.111]  Nobody seems to remember history.
[01:25:21.111 --> 01:25:23.731]  I don't know if you've ever heard of this allegory.
[01:25:23.731 --> 01:25:35.254]  When Julius Caesar had his triumphant, during, after he entered Rome, he had a slave repeat in his ear two things.
[01:25:35.254 --> 01:25:38.595]  One, remember you are but a man, you're not a god.
[01:25:38.595 --> 01:25:44.736]  And the second thing was, if you fail to learn from history, you're condemned to repeat it.
[01:25:44.736 --> 01:25:47.317]  And right now, our country's repeating history.
[01:25:47.864 --> 01:25:48.804]  That's right, that's right.
[01:25:48.804 --> 01:25:59.028]  Julian Caesar would have his aide behind him repeat that to him over and over again so that he wouldn't become hubris filled because that would blind him politically.
[01:25:59.028 --> 01:26:01.028]  And he still ended up getting killed.
[01:26:01.028 --> 01:26:06.670]  And this elite literally thinks they're invincible and is leading us towards thermal nuclear war.
[01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:08.531]  Oh, exactly.
[01:26:08.531 --> 01:26:16.033]  Well, this is when I was listening to the idiot box back a few weeks ago, excuse me.
[01:26:17.353 --> 01:26:26.397]  Our politicians were stating unequivocally, oh well, our country happens to go ahead and we don't hurt men, women, and children.
[01:26:26.397 --> 01:26:29.718]  We never hurt the innocents.
[01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:42.744]  And it sickened me because I'm Native American and I keep thinking that, well let's see, I can list line item by line item of how many tribes you wiped out all in the name of your conquest.
[01:26:43.649 --> 01:26:49.691]  Well, I mean, that's the issue, is that it's so cynical when they get up there and go, we care about the children in Syria.
[01:26:49.691 --> 01:26:56.853]  When Madeleine Albright was asked, half a million Iraqi kids have died under the sanctions, is that a good thing and should it continue?
[01:26:56.853 --> 01:26:59.214]  And she said, yeah, it's a good thing.
[01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:00.574]  That's on record!
[01:27:00.574 --> 01:27:03.415]  You know, the Esquire writer didn't believe me when I said that.
[01:27:03.415 --> 01:27:05.796]  He went and pulled the clip up and couldn't believe it.
[01:27:05.796 --> 01:27:09.477]  I mean, these globalists think of all of us as dog meat.
[01:27:10.345 --> 01:27:13.146]  They don't even care about their own children in many cases.
[01:27:13.146 --> 01:27:18.529]  They are sociopaths and psychopaths, and we're all in great peril.
[01:27:18.529 --> 01:27:21.290]  Good to hear from you, Ronald.
[01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:24.171]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Illinois, writer and blogger.
[01:27:24.171 --> 01:27:28.073]  What's your take from somebody in the media, your perspective on where things are going?
[01:27:29.557 --> 01:27:30.477]  Hey, buddy.
[01:27:30.477 --> 01:27:40.340]  Uh, I have traveled through the rabbit hole and punched through the bottom of oblivion, through death, hell, and heaven, and to come back and say, beware the devil's disguises.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:48.303]  The New World Order 1%ers have become lazy, decadent, and overly sinful, and it is now time for them to pay.
[01:27:48.303 --> 01:27:52.144]  Pay for the damages they have made to our humanity's planet.
[01:27:52.144 --> 01:27:57.346]  Avenge the Swiss cheese, gas, exploded children.
[01:27:57.346 --> 01:27:58.266]  We must put a mirror
[01:27:59.016 --> 01:28:03.023]  In front of them, so they can see the monstrosity that they are.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.044]  Well, I agree with that statement, and the decadent always look at you and go, oh, you just don't want us to have fun.
[01:28:11.044 --> 01:28:15.968]  Or they laugh at those of us that are criticizing what they're involved in.
[01:28:15.968 --> 01:28:19.391]  People think of decadence as sex or eating too much.
[01:28:19.391 --> 01:28:26.837]  Real decadence is not caring about your neighbors, not having empathy, not caring about innocent animals.
[01:28:26.837 --> 01:28:28.799]  You know, just basic things like that.
[01:28:28.799 --> 01:28:30.020]  Not caring about your neighbor.
[01:28:31.007 --> 01:28:37.381]  They don't understand that when no one cares, everything goes to hell in a handbasket, and then the predators end up ruling.
[01:28:37.381 --> 01:28:39.425]  We need good people to come together in...
[01:28:42.114 --> 01:28:44.276]  Societies of freedom.
[01:28:44.276 --> 01:28:46.177]  Humans always get in gangs.
[01:28:46.177 --> 01:29:00.307]  We need gangs that are into art and literature and freedom, and into individualism, and into women being powerful, and men being powerful, and celebrating maleness, and celebrating femininity, and celebrating the family.
[01:29:00.307 --> 01:29:06.031]  Instead, the corporatists want you to celebrate their plastic, fake culture of death, Alex.
[01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:06.731]  God bless you.
[01:29:06.731 --> 01:29:07.672]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:29:08.857 --> 01:29:18.265]  Yeah, um, that New Yorker told you some advice regarding meditation and I've seen that you've kind of been on edge and kind of scrambled by all this chaos.
[01:29:18.265 --> 01:29:20.547]  Uh, I forgot his name, but he's a New Yorker.
[01:29:20.547 --> 01:29:22.509]  You always have him on.
[01:29:22.509 --> 01:29:23.850]  He was on just last week.
[01:29:26.195 --> 01:29:27.575]  Salente.
[01:29:27.575 --> 01:29:28.476]  Yeah, Salente.
[01:29:28.476 --> 01:29:30.956]  He recommended you doing meditation.
[01:29:30.956 --> 01:29:34.517]  I'd highly recommend that you do at least 10 minutes a day of meditation.
[01:29:34.517 --> 01:29:35.138]  Oh, I agree.
[01:29:35.138 --> 01:29:35.458]  I agree.
[01:29:35.458 --> 01:29:39.739]  I've got the most stressful job probably out there because I can't turn off caring.
[01:29:39.739 --> 01:29:41.820]  I'm not saying that like I'm some goody two-shoe.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:45.501]  I mean, I cannot turn off everything affecting me.
[01:29:45.501 --> 01:29:48.181]  I'm the opposite of a psychopath, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:50.122]  And I know you are as well.
[01:29:50.122 --> 01:29:51.522]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.522 --> 01:29:53.023]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.059 --> 01:29:56.724]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:16.072 --> 01:33:19.373]  These are our people.
[01:33:19.373 --> 01:33:20.253]  The workers.
[01:33:20.253 --> 01:33:23.254]  The strivers.
[01:33:23.254 --> 01:33:25.934]  The builders.
[01:33:25.934 --> 01:33:29.395]  These are our people.
[01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:32.735]  Who are they?
[01:33:32.735 --> 01:33:35.556]  They are the dark armies.
[01:33:35.556 --> 01:33:41.637]  The dark murdering armies whose only honour is atrocity.
[01:33:41.637 --> 01:33:42.758]  The answer to 1984.
[01:33:46.025 --> 01:33:51.610]  Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:33:51.610 --> 01:33:52.691]  I'm gonna break down
[01:34:06.246 --> 01:34:12.232]  What I have researched, and what the globalists admit, so often I say, I have discovered.
[01:34:12.232 --> 01:34:16.596]  It's like I drove to the East Coast and discovered the Atlantic Ocean for the first time.
[01:34:16.596 --> 01:34:18.137]  It's not like I discovered it.
[01:34:18.137 --> 01:34:27.906]  I'm saying, here's the great truth that is there for everybody, and you can disagree with me if you want, but I know you're not going to when you hear me talk about this, because you have experienced it.
[01:34:30.444 --> 01:34:34.865]  Those of us that are not completely narcissistic are blind to this to a great extent.
[01:34:34.865 --> 01:34:44.248]  So I'm going to explain what the psychopaths are doing, what they're scientifically programming, and how we can hopefully reach out and wake people up.
[01:34:44.248 --> 01:34:48.789]  And then I'm going to go back to Chris and Bruce and Steve and Dan and Charlie, everybody that's holding.
[01:34:48.789 --> 01:34:53.191]  And then into the next hour, I want to hear from military about the Syria strike situation.
[01:34:54.164 --> 01:34:56.745]  Now Obama's saying, well a red line's rhetorical.
[01:34:56.745 --> 01:34:59.246]  First he said it's a set red line, that's the end of it.
[01:34:59.246 --> 01:35:04.468]  Then he said, a year later, last week, I never said there was a red line.
[01:35:04.468 --> 01:35:06.829]  And then they went, well we meant it was a rhetorical red line.
[01:35:06.829 --> 01:35:10.851]  And there's absolute proof Assad did it, but it doesn't matter who did it.
[01:35:10.851 --> 01:35:12.752]  Remember he said that in his first speech three weeks ago, Kerry?
[01:35:14.264 --> 01:35:19.665]  And then now they're going, oh, looks like the rebels might have done it, but that's why we got to go in, because the rebels have the chemicals.
[01:35:19.665 --> 01:35:20.906]  Al-Qaeda's there.
[01:35:20.906 --> 01:35:28.647]  We have to go in because of them, is a new spin I'm hearing, when our government put them in charge.
[01:35:28.647 --> 01:35:38.530]  It'd be like if I sent in bank robbers to rob a bank, and they're loading a truck full of all the cash, and the cops pull up, and I go, officers, you need to arrest these men immediately for robbing the bank.
[01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:39.990]  I will take the cash and protect it.
[01:35:45.175 --> 01:35:48.297]  It's so ridiculous, and I think that's what's happened.
[01:35:48.297 --> 01:35:57.544]  They're waging war against reality, because if they can overthrow reality, if they can get us into that kind of trance-like state fully, they can do anything.
[01:35:57.544 --> 01:36:01.267]  The establishment is collectively mad.
[01:36:01.267 --> 01:36:07.671]  Doesn't mean they're not functioning at a high level and able to run things, as obsessive-compulsives in many cases.
[01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:11.314]  A bunch of narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive psychopaths.
[01:36:11.314 --> 01:36:14.376]  What was the term the other day I heard?
[01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:23.355]  I was talking to somebody on the phone, who was that, and they called it Diabolical Narcissism.
[01:36:23.355 --> 01:36:27.138]  And I think that's the term.
[01:36:27.138 --> 01:36:34.024]  Diabolical Narcissism.
[01:36:34.024 --> 01:36:36.165]  Amazing.
[01:36:36.165 --> 01:36:42.651]  But before I get back to your calls and all of that news and get into some of the economy, I don't want to get diverted off like I did earlier.
[01:36:43.396 --> 01:36:49.238]  to reading a big investigative report out of the Washington Post.
[01:36:49.238 --> 01:37:03.603]  15-page investigative report, only part one, about how old people are targeted by the establishment all over the state of Maryland, having their homes taken when they've actually paid the property tax.
[01:37:03.603 --> 01:37:09.705]  Then there's the whole fraud of the property tax itself, and then the fact that I literally had flashbacks.
[01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:30.050]  Bad memories of the trenches back when I would mainly cover local news and go and discover all this and have old ladies crying in their kitchen thanking me for trying to help them.
[01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:39.412]  And then even going to court and stuff and then watching the criminals try to cover up and wanting to punch them in the face in the hallway.
[01:37:40.442 --> 01:37:41.403]  And not being able to.
[01:37:41.403 --> 01:37:45.145]  Because, you know, the normal things, like ripping off an old lady or something.
[01:37:45.145 --> 01:37:46.886]  I mean, you want to attack them.
[01:37:46.886 --> 01:37:52.730]  I mean, that's a normal behavior of somebody to want to defend innocence.
[01:37:52.730 --> 01:37:57.873]  But not being able to is, I think, is what turned me into this kind of violent person on air.
[01:37:57.873 --> 01:38:03.537]  Like, I attack people with my voice and with rhetoric that's based on truth because I hate them.
[01:38:05.185 --> 01:38:13.912]  And the only sucker I get, suker, the only aiding and abetting, the only comfort I get, not sucker, suker.
[01:38:13.912 --> 01:38:17.055]  Just pull the definition of that for me, thanks.
[01:38:17.055 --> 01:38:28.985]  The only reprieve I get from the pain of having empathy is to attack the enemy.
[01:38:28.985 --> 01:38:32.268]  So that's why I act like this, and I apologize for acting like that sometimes.
[01:38:33.454 --> 01:38:41.337]  And again, sometimes I tend to start talking about myself because it's all a process of being on air and dealing with this and being... People ask, how do I handle this?
[01:38:41.337 --> 01:38:42.898]  How do I deal with this?
[01:38:42.898 --> 01:38:44.719]  And now I realize I haven't really handled it.
[01:38:44.719 --> 01:38:46.019]  I haven't really dealt with it.
[01:38:46.019 --> 01:38:56.984]  How do I not become a brutish, goblin-like gorilla fighting these people?
[01:38:56.984 --> 01:38:59.925]  Now, shifting gears to a really big subject.
[01:39:02.113 --> 01:39:06.679]  And the best way for me to break this down is anecdotal.
[01:39:06.679 --> 01:39:09.162]  Give you an example of what I've been through.
[01:39:09.162 --> 01:39:10.223]  Working in media...
[01:39:11.374 --> 01:39:14.215]  I got into media because I didn't want to have my guns taken.
[01:39:14.215 --> 01:39:19.157]  I got into journalism because I wanted to expose globalism.
[01:39:19.157 --> 01:39:22.658]  I got into the media because that's how you fight tyranny.
[01:39:22.658 --> 01:39:38.044]  But most people that you run into, most people, I'd say 60% or more, that get into media, it's because they feel unfulfilled and unconfident and they feel like that if they could get on a big platform in status that they would be fulfilled and successful.
[01:39:39.324 --> 01:39:44.407]  Some get into it for purely mercenary reasons and believe they can make a bunch of money out of it.
[01:39:44.407 --> 01:39:50.070]  And those are the types that actually really soar up the ranks of news.
[01:39:50.070 --> 01:40:07.720]  But when you get into entertainment, it is a bunch of addled narcissists, and so then they push the culture of dumbed-down narcissism and, you know, basketball players going and visiting North Korea as Kim Jong-un mows down the symphony orchestra because his wife is jealous of him or whatever.
[01:40:09.011 --> 01:40:13.294]  It's all about these narcissists and their power trips.
[01:40:13.294 --> 01:40:24.342]  But living in Austin, Texas, that's already had a big entertainment industry ever since I've lived here since high school in the early 1990s.
[01:40:27.482 --> 01:40:34.526]  And being able to experience some of that and be involved in that, I learned that the grass is not greener on the other side.
[01:40:34.526 --> 01:40:36.888]  Celebrities are normal people just like everybody else.
[01:40:36.888 --> 01:40:41.611]  All that really matters is art and things that are interesting, not just because somebody's famous.
[01:40:41.611 --> 01:40:43.753]  That means nothing.
[01:40:43.753 --> 01:40:52.399]  And so I really got a inside view in radio, TV, print, Hollywood, all of it in the last 18 years to understand it.
[01:40:53.809 --> 01:41:19.483]  And to understand how celebrities are literally worshipped as gods, and on average the successful ones that you see out front are actually put there because they re-magnify the narcissism that Edward Bernays, 80-something years ago, wrote about, saying we should change the subject from issues to nothing but the pageantry of the narcissism, so that everybody gets obsessed with looking at their own reflection in the water.
[01:41:20.484 --> 01:41:24.025]  Instead of looking at the real world going on around them.
[01:41:24.025 --> 01:41:31.768]  So the whole world's been built to distract you from reality, so you're not a real player in the real world.
[01:41:31.768 --> 01:41:41.632]  It's psychological sabotage, and I mean, trying to get into this, it could take hours, but I'll just briefly get into it, and then maybe later even make a film about narcissism, I think.
[01:41:42.995 --> 01:41:49.857]  Because when you're young, you need to be a little bit narcissistic, so you develop your image and go out and find a mate and, you know, have some drive.
[01:41:49.857 --> 01:42:01.540]  But as you become more successful in the hierarchy of needs, healthy psychology, you care about your children, you care about the culture, you care about the future, you understand you're not going to live forever, you're part of something bigger.
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.561]  That's normal development.
[01:42:03.561 --> 01:42:06.402]  So you're supposed to act like a narcissist at 13 years old, not at 35.
[01:42:11.803 --> 01:42:16.666]  And you're not supposed to take yourself so serious as you get older.
[01:42:16.666 --> 01:42:36.358]  Now that's the normal hierarchy of needs, but if they can arrest your development at about a 12 or 13 year old level where you're trying to be accepted in high school as a freshman, if they can freeze you there, they can then control the messages, and the media and the establishment can be the cool kids, and you'll do anything to feel like you've been accepted by them.
[01:42:40.777 --> 01:42:52.840]  Not knowing that the real controllers of all this, we hardly even know their names, they're never on television, they're completely secretive, surrounded by art and literature and science, but only to use that to control people.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:58.822]  The real power structure is the opposite of a narcissist, they're more like a control freak.
[01:42:58.822 --> 01:43:03.943]  But they use narcissism as the cultural poison.
[01:43:03.943 --> 01:43:08.184]  And now that my beloved Austin, Texas, that my mom grew up in, my grandparents are from,
[01:43:10.319 --> 01:43:20.408]  As Los Angeles, and I have the article right here, as Los Angeles collapses, as the propaganda factory, the narcissist command base collapses, and the L.A.
[01:43:20.408 --> 01:43:37.703]  mayor declares state of emergency as movie, TV production flees Hollywood, as it collapses, you've got millions of vampires who, you know, moved out there when they were kids for music, for film, for whatever, that will do anything they think, that they won't survive, they won't live,
[01:43:39.824 --> 01:43:46.409]  Unless they can be a Hollywood star, or a rock star, or a rap star, or whatever the case is, and they don't do it for the art.
[01:43:46.409 --> 01:43:50.092]  They only do it because they think they're going to die.
[01:43:50.092 --> 01:43:50.993]  They need the oxygen.
[01:43:50.993 --> 01:43:56.637]  They feel so empty because they are so close to Hollywood that's so empty.
[01:43:56.637 --> 01:43:59.519]  So they think if they just get closer to it, they'll be fulfilled.
[01:43:59.519 --> 01:44:05.464]  When the more they get closer to the fame, the more empty they're going to be, the more imprisoned.
[01:44:06.311 --> 01:44:07.452]  The more surrounded.
[01:44:07.452 --> 01:44:16.321]  When I'm flying into Los Angeles, folks, literally, only place in the world this happens, I feel physically sick and freaked out and want to get out of there.
[01:44:16.321 --> 01:44:19.924]  In fact, basically no one can get me to come there now.
[01:44:19.924 --> 01:44:23.227]  I haven't been there in years and have had all sorts of amazing offers.
[01:44:23.227 --> 01:44:24.629]  You know, I will not go there.
[01:44:26.604 --> 01:44:27.685]  I will not get anywhere near it.
[01:44:27.685 --> 01:44:30.986]  Because I'm telling you, spiritually folks, I can feel it.
[01:44:30.986 --> 01:44:33.367]  Because everybody's had their souls sucked out there.
[01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:34.447]  And let me tell you what's happened.
[01:44:34.447 --> 01:44:35.667]  I may have to leave Austin.
[01:44:35.667 --> 01:44:37.668]  I'm making this announcement now.
[01:44:37.668 --> 01:44:38.468]  It'll be a big deal.
[01:44:38.468 --> 01:44:39.269]  It'll be a few years.
[01:44:39.269 --> 01:44:41.930]  I don't know how we're going to do it.
[01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:43.530]  They're all moving here.
[01:44:43.530 --> 01:44:46.651]  Not Californians.
[01:44:46.651 --> 01:44:48.292]  All the nice Californians.
[01:44:48.292 --> 01:44:53.974]  The LA people that have all failed are all racing here.
[01:44:55.698 --> 01:44:57.901]  And setting up shop all around them.
[01:44:57.901 --> 01:45:04.871]  This is a microcosm of how the New World Order in Washington DC works as well.
[01:45:04.871 --> 01:45:06.212]  They're all moving here.
[01:45:08.658 --> 01:45:21.201]  As the next big gold rush of where they can finally make it and there's con artists set up everywhere that you'll pay money to so you can maybe talk to a band about being part of their operation.
[01:45:21.201 --> 01:45:27.863]  Or all these people delusionally who know someone that knows someone who makes movies.
[01:45:27.863 --> 01:45:30.824]  And it's all just mass mental illness.
[01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:31.224]  I know.
[01:45:33.792 --> 01:45:55.141]  Dozens and dozens of people just the last five years who've gone completely bonkers Believing when they couldn't become movie stars or rock stars that they were movie stars or rock stars and literally become artificial schizophrenics I don't know what you call it because they weren't schizophrenic before they weren't crazy before they actually go insane Believing that they finally made it
[01:45:57.762 --> 01:46:02.526]  Or they'll give everything they've got to con artists that are telling them that they're going to be stars.
[01:46:02.526 --> 01:46:05.748]  And that's what Obama did when they made him a movie star.
[01:46:05.748 --> 01:46:10.612]  When you bought into Obama and you bought into his cult, well, then you became a winner.
[01:46:10.612 --> 01:46:11.733]  I know a lot of this is elementary.
[01:46:11.733 --> 01:46:13.535]  People are like, yeah, tell us the big revelation.
[01:46:13.535 --> 01:46:14.195]  We know this.
[01:46:14.195 --> 01:46:18.138]  Well, you have to understand how strong it is, though.
[01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:19.540]  And how horrible it is.
[01:46:21.533 --> 01:46:25.776]  To watch the spiders that set themselves up to use and abuse.
[01:46:25.776 --> 01:46:31.080]  I have to tell Crewe when we hire him here, listen, you're going to have all these offers for media stuff.
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:34.002]  None of it's going to be real.
[01:46:34.002 --> 01:46:37.065]  They're just going to offer you stuff to go work for them for free and then cheat you.
[01:46:37.065 --> 01:46:37.845]  That's how L.A.
[01:46:37.845 --> 01:46:38.446]  works.
[01:46:38.446 --> 01:46:39.887]  And that's how Austin works now.
[01:46:39.887 --> 01:46:43.690]  And people have gone before and left to go do deals.
[01:46:43.690 --> 01:46:45.191]  And then, of course, they call me back a month ago.
[01:46:45.191 --> 01:46:46.072]  It was all a con job.
[01:46:46.072 --> 01:46:46.872]  Can I have my job back?
[01:46:46.872 --> 01:46:49.834]  And I go, no, you're not going to stop.
[01:46:49.834 --> 01:46:50.395]  You can't help it.
[01:46:54.605 --> 01:46:55.605]  And that's all L.A.
[01:46:55.605 --> 01:46:58.707]  does, is endless meetings and people trying to get angles.
[01:46:58.707 --> 01:47:02.108]  It's like vampires looking for people to suck dry, but there's nobody left.
[01:47:02.108 --> 01:47:05.430]  So now, I'm dubbing it the Vampire Invasion.
[01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:08.151]  Austin, Texas is overrun with vampires.
[01:47:08.151 --> 01:47:13.273]  Thank God they're only segregated to the trendy areas.
[01:47:13.273 --> 01:47:22.157]  And they're all trying to feed on each other here, and I mean, it's overrun, ladies and gentlemen, with delusional Emperor's new clothes.
[01:47:22.157 --> 01:47:23.878]  In fact, let me show you some of the articles right here.
[01:47:26.047 --> 01:47:30.693]  Emperor's New Clothes is written by Hans Christian Andersen, the guy that wrote My Little Mermaid.
[01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:41.354]  Little Mermaid, about two weavers who promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those, unfit for their positions.
[01:47:41.354 --> 01:47:42.955]  Stupid or incompetent.
[01:47:42.955 --> 01:47:50.036]  When the emperor parades before his subjects of the new clothes, no one wants to admit they're stupid or ignorant when he's completely butt naked.
[01:47:50.036 --> 01:47:53.417]  Finally a small child says, but he isn't wearing anything at all.
[01:47:53.417 --> 01:47:55.318]  And that's the tipping point, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:56.858 --> 01:48:17.129]  Now understanding mass narcissism, artificial mass mental illness, where people don't understand being honorable is how you succeed in life, or being an artist and loving your work is how you succeed, or being a good person is how you succeed, or, you know, just raising healthy, happy children is how you succeed, or being truthful and having integrity is how you succeed.
[01:48:17.129 --> 01:48:17.690]  No!
[01:48:17.690 --> 01:48:19.471]  They think you only succeed
[01:48:20.816 --> 01:48:34.859]  And then they worship you but also hate you at the same time because you've been on national television or you've had a successful this or that and they think by being around you they're suddenly going to become successful just because like some magic rubs off on them.
[01:48:34.859 --> 01:48:44.402]  But all it does is attract vampires that can't get to you they can get to them and then they tear them away from you off to be torn to shreds politically.
[01:48:44.402 --> 01:48:49.063]  And that's what the mainstream media is and the whole culture is you buy into this big lie
[01:48:52.389 --> 01:49:06.720]  And folks, I've had distant family, and I've had another guy we worked with more than 10 years ago that I heard on air saying, I've been offered by the ambassador from Nigeria to be given $14 million if I only send him $10,000.
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:09.503]  And I called the person and I said, you know that's a fraud.
[01:49:10.373 --> 01:49:14.235]  And the person said, no, you're just jealous that the ambassador didn't contact you.
[01:49:14.235 --> 01:49:17.496]  And I said, man, this is a known fraud for like five, six years at that time.
[01:49:17.496 --> 01:49:18.897]  It's like 17, 18 years now.
[01:49:18.897 --> 01:49:21.858]  And I said, I will assure you it is a known fraud.
[01:49:21.858 --> 01:49:29.201]  And the guy went on air and said that I was jealous of him getting the $14 million, which he never got it.
[01:49:29.201 --> 01:49:33.043]  And then he was even more mad when he ended up getting ripped off and didn't get it.
[01:49:33.043 --> 01:49:36.504]  Folks, I know people where I tell them, I go, this is a con.
[01:49:36.504 --> 01:49:37.285]  This isn't real.
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:43.042]  I mean, people come to me and they say, my daughter has been sent something in the mail.
[01:49:43.042 --> 01:49:48.565]  It's only $1,000 to get placed in a thing for models.
[01:49:48.565 --> 01:49:51.346]  And then it's $5,000 once that comes in.
[01:49:51.346 --> 01:49:53.347]  And they go, will you help me with the money?
[01:49:53.347 --> 01:49:56.668]  And these are nice people.
[01:49:56.668 --> 01:50:00.370]  And I'm saying, listen, hon, this is a fraud.
[01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:03.211]  And I said, just to teach you, here's $1,000 to enter it.
[01:50:03.211 --> 01:50:06.353]  But when they come back wanting $5,000, I did this actually.
[01:50:07.398 --> 01:50:09.099]  You're going to know it's not real.
[01:50:09.099 --> 01:50:10.700]  And of course that happened.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:13.001]  Because see, they wouldn't have believed me if I just said no.
[01:50:13.001 --> 01:50:21.165]  And then see, what happens is, once you're sucked into this fraud, you don't ever want to admit you've been sucked into it.
[01:50:21.165 --> 01:50:28.469]  And folks, I deal with this now on a weekly basis with people that are delusional.
[01:50:28.469 --> 01:50:32.351]  Oh, and when people think you're successful, the con artists that come out of the woodwork,
[01:50:34.093 --> 01:50:36.495]  Going after my wife, my family, my dad.
[01:50:36.495 --> 01:50:38.457]  I mean, it is... Because that's their economy.
[01:50:38.457 --> 01:50:42.420]  They've got to rip somebody off or con something instead of building something.
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:44.682]  And see, that's when cultures fall.
[01:50:44.682 --> 01:50:46.464]  That's when they collapse.
[01:50:46.464 --> 01:50:48.806]  So it's like the Nigerian email scams.
[01:50:48.806 --> 01:50:51.468]  It's like the Emperor's New Clothes.
[01:50:51.468 --> 01:50:58.114]  It's all these Vanity Fair things they set up where they tell people, oh, you'll get to be in a rock band if you pay us money.
[01:50:58.114 --> 01:50:59.515]  I'll explain when we come back.
[01:51:01.476 --> 01:51:05.279]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.

[01:54:19.341 --> 01:54:24.325]  Take Austin, Texas, where I live, the supposed live music capital of the world.
[01:54:24.325 --> 01:54:28.788]  What it is, is the music con artist capital of the world.
[01:54:28.788 --> 01:54:33.432]  You've probably got, let's not exaggerate, a hundred thousand musicians out of a million people living here.
[01:54:33.432 --> 01:54:43.160]  And there are all these groups that feed on them, that produce their records, that produce their albums, that take their glamour shots for five, ten times what it's worth.
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:46.743]  There's all these lawyers that prey on them, that are gonna get them the big record deal.
[01:54:47.523 --> 01:54:49.484]  And all it is is a predatory group feeding on them.
[01:54:49.484 --> 01:54:51.384]  Here's another example.
[01:54:51.384 --> 01:54:54.145]  You'll have some guy, you know, out of college with a bunch of debt.
[01:54:54.145 --> 01:54:55.446]  Same thing as his girlfriend.
[01:54:55.446 --> 01:55:00.387]  They're going to get married and the women's magazines and everything say you got to have a $200,000 wedding.
[01:55:00.387 --> 01:55:03.168]  You got to have all these photographers that are super expensive.
[01:55:03.168 --> 01:55:06.149]  You've got to have this $5,000, you know, cake.
[01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:07.550]  Or he doesn't love you.
[01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:11.011]  And you've got to have a ring that is basically a year's salary.
[01:55:13.203 --> 01:55:15.345]  And then literally it's a semi-precious diamond.
[01:55:15.345 --> 01:55:16.826]  Diamonds aren't even precious, folks.
[01:55:16.826 --> 01:55:18.287]  They're semi-precious.
[01:55:18.287 --> 01:55:21.909]  But they're geographically located so they can control them as a monopoly.
[01:55:21.909 --> 01:55:23.650]  And it's all a giant fraud.
[01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:35.479]  And so the economy becomes this huge fraud and everyone's running after the tokens of success so that they can feel like they're more powerful than those beneath them.
[01:55:36.823 --> 01:55:42.005]  And then your culture becomes dead and becomes plastic and becomes stagnant.
[01:55:42.005 --> 01:55:52.148]  And my problem is, is that I don't, in literature, in psychology and in history, I know cultures can go mad.
[01:55:52.148 --> 01:55:55.809]  But I'm trying to understand what do you call it where people artificially
[01:55:57.298 --> 01:56:10.968]  We're not mentally ill, genetically, or to begin with, or chemically, but they artificially, under peer pressure, I guess it's a mob narcissism, almost like mass Stockholm Syndrome, a term I've coined.
[01:56:10.968 --> 01:56:19.053]  It's like a mob, mob narcissism, mob delusional, mob psychology.
[01:56:19.053 --> 01:56:25.558]  It is mob psychology, mass mob effect, in some type of bizarre,
[01:56:27.205 --> 01:56:34.110]  Manifestation where the system is completely wearing no clothes and then we just buy into it.
[01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:35.971]  Well, it's time to not buy into it.
[01:56:35.971 --> 01:56:40.474]  And then those of us that do wake up from it and don't want to be part of it, we're the bad people.
[01:56:40.474 --> 01:56:48.000]  And then you wonder why the glazed-eyed public laughs at you when you're awake and informed and it makes you feel bad.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.041]  They're laughing because they're insecure.
[01:56:50.041 --> 01:56:53.263]  They're
[01:56:54.417 --> 01:57:05.624]  They're laughing at you as just a confidence act of if they act like they're in charge and they're in control, everything's gonna be alright.
[01:57:05.624 --> 01:57:07.545]  That's what's going on.
[01:57:07.545 --> 01:57:09.367]  And they're dangerous.
[01:57:09.367 --> 01:57:18.512]  And they will buy into anything as long as it's the new fad, and the system can produce whatever fad it wants, so it is the Pied Piper.
[01:57:18.512 --> 01:57:22.055]  Leading the children away.
[01:57:22.055 --> 01:57:22.175]  And
[01:57:23.689 --> 01:57:30.244]  What freaks me out the worst about all this is, and I'm going to come back with the next hour and go right to your calls, those that are holding.
[01:57:30.244 --> 01:57:31.968]  What freaks me out really, really bad...
[01:57:33.712 --> 01:57:41.735]  Is that even when they've been conned, and they know they're being conned, they won't admit it to themselves because they won't admit they've been taken.
[01:57:41.735 --> 01:57:52.718]  So like a gambler at Vegas who gets deeper and deeper into debt and they start mortgaging their house and going to the pawn shop and selling their watch and their kid's college fund to come back because they're gonna make it.
[01:57:52.718 --> 01:57:54.859]  They're gonna get themselves out of this hole.
[01:57:57.392 --> 01:58:08.397]  And it's so sad to then watch the psychopaths and social engineers taking over the world by manipulating the public that they've artificially engineered to be narcissistic.
[01:58:09.249 --> 01:58:14.912]  It is absolutely insane, and that's why it's more important than ever that everybody out there support this broadcast.

[02:00:10.441 --> 02:00:12.022]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.022 --> 02:00:13.563]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.563 --> 02:00:17.765]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.765 --> 02:00:21.828]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.170 --> 02:00:33.254]  Well, now they're trying to spin Syria that, oh, if he'll just give up his chemical weapons, even if he gives them to Russia, that's okay.
[02:00:33.254 --> 02:00:34.134]  We've won.
[02:00:34.134 --> 02:00:35.735]  As if he did the chemical attack.
[02:00:35.735 --> 02:00:38.877]  They'll just get rid of the chemical weapons as a deterrent like they did in Iraq and...
[02:00:40.615 --> 02:00:42.016]  1991 and then invade again later.
[02:00:42.016 --> 02:00:43.356]  I mean, that's what this is all about.
[02:00:43.356 --> 02:00:45.717]  This is all about world government.
[02:00:45.717 --> 02:00:46.638]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:00:46.638 --> 02:00:47.678]  I had a bunch of people holding.
[02:00:47.678 --> 02:00:48.418]  I apologize.
[02:00:48.418 --> 02:00:50.999]  I went on too long with the whole narcissism rant.
[02:00:50.999 --> 02:00:56.181]  But let's talk to Bruce in Colorado, then Steve, Dan, Jeremy and others.
[02:00:56.181 --> 02:00:58.182]  And now the phones are just wide open for everybody.
[02:00:58.182 --> 02:00:58.242]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:58.242 --> 02:00:58.682]  Bruce in Colorado.
[02:00:58.682 --> 02:00:59.242]  Welcome.
[02:01:04.071 --> 02:01:05.193]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[02:01:05.193 --> 02:01:13.105]  We're live in the heart of the New World Order here in Denver and they're bringing George Bush to Denver tonight so they can parade around.
[02:01:13.105 --> 02:01:14.427]  DU is sponsoring
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:18.603]  The Improving Human Condition Award going to George Bush.
[02:01:18.603 --> 02:01:19.884]  It's doublespeak.
[02:01:19.884 --> 02:01:21.825]  It's in Denver.
[02:01:21.825 --> 02:01:23.667]  I didn't know if you guys had heard about that.
[02:01:23.667 --> 02:01:32.374]  I think that we need to call for Obama to come arrest Bush instead of going into Syria and worrying about the chemical weapons attack.
[02:01:32.374 --> 02:01:40.621]  I think we should talk about the DU, depleted uranium rounds that Bush is okay that our troops use and our troops are still dying from it today and they're still suffering.
[02:01:41.241 --> 02:01:51.191]  And so I think that's highly important, and I wanted to call and just let you know that We Are Change Colorado is going to be out there in full force tonight, and it's going to be a... Yeah, no, I did see that about a month ago.
[02:01:51.191 --> 02:01:57.497]  They announced he was getting the award, and I guess he's going to receive it now for Improving Humanity Award.
[02:01:57.497 --> 02:01:59.960]  I think they should give Obama one as well.
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:01.401]  And while they're at it, they could dig up...
[02:02:02.642 --> 02:02:05.204]  You know, maybe Joe Stalin and give him an award.
[02:02:05.204 --> 02:02:06.064]  How's that sound?
[02:02:06.064 --> 02:02:07.545]  Yeah, all the dictators.
[02:02:07.545 --> 02:02:11.087]  Now this is just a slap in the face of DU.
[02:02:11.087 --> 02:02:18.332]  Two-thirds of staff signed a letter saying we don't want George here in our name at our university, Denver University.
[02:02:19.152 --> 02:02:20.593]  Most of the students don't approve.
[02:02:20.593 --> 02:02:26.217]  Today's the first day of class coming back and this is going to be down at the Colorado Convention Center.
[02:02:26.217 --> 02:02:31.360]  So anyone in Denver or in the Colorado area should come out and see this one.
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:32.380]  It's going to be a spectacle.
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:41.766]  We're working with a lot of different activist groups here in Denver to just get the numbers up and just show that we're not okay with George W. Bush coming to Denver and winning.
[02:02:41.766 --> 02:02:44.228]  Now they had to change it from improving human condition
[02:02:44.748 --> 02:02:46.248]  Absolutely, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:46.248 --> 02:02:47.789]  Steve in Chicago, you're on the air.
[02:03:07.185 --> 02:03:08.646]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:03:08.646 --> 02:03:12.667]  What I'm concerned about is Tartus, the Soviet installation there.
[02:03:12.667 --> 02:03:14.768]  Nobody's given that a lot of publicity.
[02:03:14.768 --> 02:03:18.869]  We need Ray McGovern in here to elucidate the problem.
[02:03:18.869 --> 02:03:25.852]  He can elaborate on the choke points for the Russian Empire, whether it's Murmansk or it's the Bering Strait or the Dardanelles Strait.
[02:03:26.452 --> 02:03:33.816]  If Russia doesn't do anything, I think that the United States will go and win hands down and puts Assad aside.
[02:03:33.816 --> 02:03:35.597]  But... Well, of course they will.
[02:03:35.597 --> 02:03:36.158]  Absolutely.
[02:03:36.158 --> 02:03:40.200]  And yes, we have Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst, joining us on Friday.
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:42.081]  So he is coming up.
[02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:44.242]  That's an excellent idea.
[02:03:44.242 --> 02:03:46.284]  And the thing is, it's all a frame up.
[02:03:46.284 --> 02:03:50.626]  They framed that Saddam Hussein and they're framing this Assad.
[02:03:50.626 --> 02:03:51.587]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:03:51.587 --> 02:03:53.568]  But what do you make of the world waking up to that?
[02:03:54.915 --> 02:03:56.537]  Well, hopefully.
[02:03:56.537 --> 02:04:00.701]  They can't get a vote in the UN Security Council because Russia's always blocking it.
[02:04:00.701 --> 02:04:03.984]  I know China is not happy with the situation.
[02:04:03.984 --> 02:04:06.066]  Maybe the tide is turning against them.
[02:04:06.066 --> 02:04:08.068]  I can't predict.
[02:04:08.068 --> 02:04:10.090]  It's beyond my capacity to do it.
[02:04:10.090 --> 02:04:11.351]  But I know one thing.
[02:04:11.351 --> 02:04:17.157]  I know that you're spreading the word like nobody else and I listened to 12.160 shortwave.
[02:04:17.157 --> 02:04:17.958]  It's excellent.
[02:04:17.958 --> 02:04:18.038]  WWCR.
[02:04:19.159 --> 02:04:22.360]  Alright, brother, you can also listen to us on 1530 there in Chicago.
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.980]  Thank you so much, Steve.
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:27.281]  Alright, Dan, Elliot, Jeremy, and others.
[02:04:27.281 --> 02:04:29.021]  Steve's been calling for like 15 years.
[02:04:29.021 --> 02:04:32.002]  Remember the time I got him to talk like McGruff the Crime Dog?
[02:04:32.002 --> 02:04:37.403]  McGruff, help take a bite out of crime.
[02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:40.124]  By the way, Friday I wanted that guy's number to do voiceovers for us.
[02:04:40.124 --> 02:04:43.005]  Did we get that number from John Harmon?
[02:04:43.005 --> 02:04:43.885]  Alright.
[02:04:43.885 --> 02:04:45.925]  How'd I get the other guy to do voiceovers?
[02:04:45.925 --> 02:04:47.786]  We could do like a parody of McGruff the Crime Dog?
[02:04:49.565 --> 02:04:52.312]  Look at me, McGruff the TSA dong.
[02:04:52.312 --> 02:04:56.022]  Help stick your hands down people's pants to find Al-Qaeda.
[02:04:56.022 --> 02:04:58.448]  Help take a bite out of proctology bills.
[02:05:01.953 --> 02:05:15.722]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, PureSilver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens, and parasites.
[02:05:15.722 --> 02:05:26.030]  At Silverlungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless PureNanoSilver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.

[02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:04.157]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:06:04.157 --> 02:06:12.186]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:06:12.186 --> 02:06:17.111]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:06:17.111 --> 02:06:20.435]  The problem is we can't help everybody, if every one of us who
[02:06:20.435 --> 02:06:21.316]  We're good to go.
[02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:46.011]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.

[02:07:01.553 --> 02:07:07.057]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[02:07:07.057 --> 02:07:10.880]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:14.283]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[02:07:14.283 --> 02:07:17.745]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[02:07:17.745 --> 02:07:24.370]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:27.793]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[02:07:28.433 --> 02:07:39.857]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[02:07:39.857 --> 02:07:44.799]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.

[02:08:17.279 --> 02:08:34.025]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:34.025 --> 02:08:43.828]  You know, talk radio network, probably the second, the third largest radio syndicator went dark last week off the air.
[02:08:43.828 --> 02:08:45.189]  Clear Channel is bankrupt.
[02:08:48.010 --> 02:08:58.816]  But the big banks, the big brokerage firms that helped consolidate the radio industry the last 15 years, they've already moved on from that.
[02:08:58.816 --> 02:09:08.822]  And I tell you, it's pretty creepy to see talk radio imploding and melting down all over the United States, something that top management of the globalists has been pushing for.
[02:09:08.822 --> 02:09:13.245]  I know a lot of inside baseball, but I'm not allowed to tell.
[02:09:13.245 --> 02:09:16.347]  But people better appreciate the talk radio that they do here.
[02:09:19.795 --> 02:09:28.417]  In fact, it was what, about six months ago we got the word that there were moves to shut off basically all libertarian and conservative talk on XM.
[02:09:28.417 --> 02:09:34.958]  But because it's been so popular, there's been internal fights with their program directors and people not to do that.
[02:09:34.958 --> 02:09:47.641]  But I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, Genesis, the GCN radio network with over 1,400 affiliates, one way or another, I've got over 160 of them, is pretty much all there's left that's somewhat independent.
[02:09:49.787 --> 02:09:54.972]  There's Clear Channel on the verge of imploding.
[02:09:54.972 --> 02:09:57.354]  And it's got a lot of great people on it.
[02:09:57.354 --> 02:10:00.477]  Like, I'm not even going to get into it anymore.
[02:10:00.477 --> 02:10:04.621]  The point is, is that I was just thinking about that during the break.
[02:10:04.621 --> 02:10:08.084]  I haven't even talked about that.
[02:10:08.084 --> 02:10:10.226]  It is such a crazy world.
[02:10:10.226 --> 02:10:11.367]  And again, it was a bubble.
[02:10:11.367 --> 02:10:12.769]  How much stations cost?
[02:10:15.233 --> 02:10:31.462]  By some of the big boys coming in the last 20 years, 15 years really and buying stations for more than they were worth and consolidating them and creating monopolies and running stations at losses to bankrupt the other local stations to create monopolies.
[02:10:31.462 --> 02:10:44.489]  Now the stations cost so much to run with the government fees and licensing and the economy in the toilet with advertising and then the cost again of just to buy the stations
[02:10:45.612 --> 02:10:54.358]  And then to finance the debt on the stations, that it is going to be a completely different landscape in just another year.
[02:10:54.358 --> 02:10:59.301]  And I will continue to be here.
[02:10:59.301 --> 02:11:03.104]  Because we're not owned by some foreign banking cartel.
[02:11:03.104 --> 02:11:03.964]  We're just here.
[02:11:03.964 --> 02:11:06.206]  Our mission is to get the word out and fight the globalists.
[02:11:07.054 --> 02:11:10.116]  Our mission is to try to avert World War III.
[02:11:10.116 --> 02:11:12.918]  Our mission is to defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:11:12.918 --> 02:11:21.984]  Not join all the kleptocrats in just some mad race.
[02:11:21.984 --> 02:11:24.626]  To make a buck as quick as you can and then watch the whole world burn.
[02:11:27.964 --> 02:11:41.834]  By the way, I'm going back to your calls, but speaking of Syria, Russia to push Syria to surrender chemical weapons, and Syria welcomes international control over chemical weapons.
[02:11:41.834 --> 02:11:45.096]  By the way, this is being called new news.
[02:11:45.096 --> 02:11:53.262]  Syria offered a year ago and again a few months ago to turn their chemical weapons over, and the Russians have had troops at the chemical weapons bases.
[02:11:53.262 --> 02:11:56.264]  So all they're doing is announcing what's already been done.
[02:11:57.833 --> 02:12:05.487]  They saw the frame-up coming a year ago and brought the Russians in.
[02:12:05.487 --> 02:12:10.476]  But we have guys in fancy suits that get up there and tell us, oh no!
[02:12:10.476 --> 02:12:11.017]  Didn't you know?
[02:12:14.807 --> 02:12:17.407]  Bashar Assad launched that chemical attack.
[02:12:17.407 --> 02:12:25.969]  Now Kerry, who cares about the children, actually, he cares about diverting everyone from all the giant scandals, the biggest of which is Obamacare.
[02:12:25.969 --> 02:12:41.072]  I'm here to announce that I've thought about the NSA, I've thought about Benghazigate, I've thought about the persecution of the Tea Parties, the persecution of journalists, the whistleblowers, the list goes on and on, but you know why the public's really waking up and doesn't buy this war?
[02:12:41.072 --> 02:12:43.332]  Out of all the different reasons, and there's a bunch.
[02:12:45.336 --> 02:12:58.967]  The biggest one is that all of these high school, college students, but also the working poor, people getting paid $7, $8, $9, $10 an hour.
[02:12:58.967 --> 02:13:01.409]  They all saw their payroll taxes go up.
[02:13:01.409 --> 02:13:04.372]  They saw the other seven taxes that are on Obamacare.
[02:13:04.372 --> 02:13:08.615]  They're getting the letters now saying they got to buy health care for at least $5,000 a year.
[02:13:08.615 --> 02:13:13.059]  That's up to a third of what they're paid a year.
[02:13:13.059 --> 02:13:14.000]  They're going bankrupt.
[02:13:15.148 --> 02:13:18.929]  Two jobs aren't enough.
[02:13:18.929 --> 02:13:25.291]  And they're all being told, you don't get 40 hours a week, you'll certainly never get overtime again.
[02:13:25.291 --> 02:13:28.352]  You're going to 20 hours.
[02:13:28.352 --> 02:13:38.235]  I was at Martin Springs, a giant, dammed up, natural spring.
[02:13:40.427 --> 02:13:45.330]  And I had a lifeguard come over to me and say, oh my gosh, they just cut everybody from 40 hours to 20.
[02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:49.193]  And they're even cutting the managers back to 20.
[02:13:49.193 --> 02:13:51.134]  Even though it says 30, they're just cutting us down to 20.
[02:13:51.134 --> 02:13:53.956]  And they're just hiring more people.
[02:13:53.956 --> 02:13:58.559]  And I tried to warn them about Obamacare, and then I had another lifeguard come over and tell me about it.
[02:13:58.559 --> 02:14:00.180]  Because they all got the word!
[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:02.361]  I was wondering why the last time I was there was all these new lifeguards.
[02:14:02.361 --> 02:14:03.562]  Well, that's the new thing!
[02:14:03.562 --> 02:14:04.822]  You get four hours a day!
[02:14:06.769 --> 02:14:08.690]  Do you like your Obamacare?
[02:14:08.690 --> 02:14:20.393]  And with that money you get, that little bit of money, you gotta go buy healthcare now, that now is run by the insurance companies that wrote it, where you don't even get the healthcare.
[02:14:20.393 --> 02:14:23.914]  The doctors aren't allowed to do the tests or the things they think need to be done.
[02:14:23.914 --> 02:14:30.215]  And I know everybody already knows this in this audience, but now to see it happen.
[02:14:30.215 --> 02:14:31.736]  Obama phone lady when she was here.
[02:14:34.167 --> 02:14:39.031]  She saw this year when it kicked in, her taxes went up.
[02:14:39.031 --> 02:14:40.712]  As a maid.
[02:14:40.712 --> 02:14:45.235]  The Obama phone lady works.
[02:14:45.235 --> 02:14:46.236]  And she had a hope.
[02:14:46.236 --> 02:14:52.761]  Her American dream was Obama was going to give her a house, a car, and when she was here, this is video that hadn't been seen yet.
[02:14:52.761 --> 02:14:54.022]  It's going to be on Obama Deception 2.
[02:14:55.325 --> 02:14:56.446]  She literally had tears in her eyes.
[02:14:56.446 --> 02:14:59.228]  She goes, I believe he's going to give me a house and a car.
[02:14:59.228 --> 02:15:03.311]  Folks, what he gave you was a tax increase, honey.
[02:15:03.311 --> 02:15:07.715]  And that's what makes me so mad about these people, is they know they're conning people.
[02:15:07.715 --> 02:15:08.635]  They get off on it.
[02:15:08.635 --> 02:15:12.218]  I know that con artists look in Obama's eyes and Kerry's eyes.
[02:15:12.218 --> 02:15:12.999]  They're predators.
[02:15:12.999 --> 02:15:15.941]  To them, it's funny.
[02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:21.646]  That's why I'll imitate them and laugh at you and laugh at us when I talk about this, is to show you what they really think.
[02:15:21.646 --> 02:15:23.247]  It's all a big joke.
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:28.383]  But just like people I currently know, I go, that's a scam.
[02:15:28.383 --> 02:15:32.145]  That somebody that knows somebody is going to give you a job working for a rock band.
[02:15:32.145 --> 02:15:34.186]  And the people have their bags all packed, ready to go meet.
[02:15:34.186 --> 02:15:36.048]  And I go, you're going to get a call.
[02:15:36.048 --> 02:15:39.450]  They're going to need more money that the rock band isn't ready to meet with you.
[02:15:39.450 --> 02:15:42.232]  And then they get the call and they go, well, that's just because they're busy.
[02:15:42.232 --> 02:15:43.913]  I have to pay them more money now.
[02:15:43.913 --> 02:15:47.575]  And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:47.575 --> 02:15:48.496]  It's a con game.
[02:15:48.496 --> 02:15:51.498]  And they're like, you're just jealous that I finally made it.
[02:15:55.598 --> 02:15:58.860]  I know people get the Nigerian email and they go, is this a true story?
[02:15:58.860 --> 02:16:03.404]  I'm with Mike Judge, you know, the creator of Beavis and Butthead, Idiocracy, you name it.
[02:16:03.404 --> 02:16:04.645]  King of the Hill.
[02:16:04.645 --> 02:16:09.729]  We like to go out sometimes and, you know, go out and hear, he likes the same music as me, kind of rockabilly stuff, blues.
[02:16:09.729 --> 02:16:10.809]  He's a great musician, his own right.
[02:16:10.809 --> 02:16:15.713]  So we go to this dive bar in East Austin.
[02:16:15.713 --> 02:16:21.958]  And, well, I got there before I, he got there to meet him just a few months ago.
[02:16:23.530 --> 02:16:27.712]  And everybody goes, the Nigerian ambassador is here.
[02:16:27.712 --> 02:16:29.933]  Everyone's, oh, oh, the Nigerian.
[02:16:29.933 --> 02:16:31.533]  And I went, oh my gosh.
[02:16:31.533 --> 02:16:37.316]  And here pulls up the old Cadillacs and an old Mercedes and people getting out, acting all powerful, posing.
[02:16:37.316 --> 02:16:38.836]  That's what the politicians do.
[02:16:38.836 --> 02:16:44.919]  And everyone's sort of bowing down, basically, in this mainly black bar we're in.
[02:16:50.188 --> 02:16:56.492]  I watch him go around everyone begging, oh, he'll let you invest if you're cool enough, but he's just handing out his card, you get to meet with him.
[02:16:56.492 --> 02:17:01.314]  And I was telling people, I go, you know, that's just a physical Nigerian scam now on the ground.
[02:17:01.314 --> 02:17:05.456]  No, no, he's actually a prince.
[02:17:05.456 --> 02:17:10.900]  And I mean, it was like coming to America, Eddie Murphy, you know, like guys with like lion hats on and stuff or whatever.
[02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:11.500]  And, uh,
[02:17:12.793 --> 02:17:15.375]  I couldn't help anybody, including the white yuppies that were there.
[02:17:15.375 --> 02:17:18.277]  I mean, by the time Judge got there, the ambassador was gone.
[02:17:18.277 --> 02:17:21.200]  It wasn't the ambassador, it was a total con game.
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:24.002]  And I went and looked it up and found out there is now a physical Nigerian scam.
[02:17:24.002 --> 02:17:27.905]  You just, I mean, if you show up in a crown, you become the king of England.
[02:17:27.905 --> 02:17:34.711]  I mean, you know, North Korea, I expect him to start wearing crowns, because in a narcissistic world where people worship status,
[02:17:38.697 --> 02:17:42.059]  You know, we're the opposite of that, going to some dive bar to hear good blues music.
[02:17:42.059 --> 02:17:51.386]  The point is, is that there, even there, I can't get away from the narcissistic, looney-tune land that the world has now become.
[02:17:51.386 --> 02:17:54.848]  And just the scams are going on every angle.
[02:17:54.848 --> 02:18:03.675]  And these women, I know, that demand their fiancé, you're going to have to take out a loan, even though her family's supposed to pay for her, they're dumb enough to.
[02:18:04.949 --> 02:18:12.454]  My wife and I, even though we had some money in the bank and things, when we got married 13 years ago, guess how many people were at our wedding?
[02:18:12.454 --> 02:18:15.356]  About 8 people.
[02:18:15.356 --> 02:18:19.940]  Went and stayed at the Driscoll, had a good dinner, went and got married by a preacher that day.
[02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:20.580]  That was it.
[02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:22.281]  Went on a vacation later.
[02:18:22.281 --> 02:18:26.604]  I think everything that might have cost, including the vacation, like $6,000 or something,
[02:18:28.803 --> 02:18:31.765]  Because we were just married.
[02:18:31.765 --> 02:18:33.366]  That's our relationship.
[02:18:33.366 --> 02:18:39.890]  And I only had a few friends there and my parents and some of her family and that was it.
[02:18:39.890 --> 02:18:44.213]  Because it was all about not being stressed out and just having a good time.
[02:18:44.213 --> 02:18:49.137]  But let me tell you, most people I know now get divorces within a few months after the bigger of the wedding.
[02:18:49.137 --> 02:18:55.241]  I've seen people that have had like $300,000 weddings and especially when they don't have money and they get everybody to go into Hawk to pay for it.
[02:18:55.241 --> 02:18:56.602]  It's this big narcissistic trip.
[02:18:57.554 --> 02:18:58.895]  They're divorced a month later.
[02:18:58.895 --> 02:19:00.336]  They're annulled a month later.
[02:19:00.336 --> 02:19:02.658]  I mean, I've been made to go to these weddings.
[02:19:02.658 --> 02:19:04.619]  Like, I won't go to a big wedding now.
[02:19:04.619 --> 02:19:08.942]  And I go to them and I'll tell my wife, I go, this is gonna be over in about a month.
[02:19:08.942 --> 02:19:14.526]  I'm going to a wedding of people worth hundreds of millions of dollars in a couple weeks.
[02:19:14.526 --> 02:19:15.647]  Actually, this weekend.
[02:19:15.647 --> 02:19:16.127]  And guess what?
[02:19:16.127 --> 02:19:18.929]  They're having a small ceremony and a dinner and that's it.
[02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:23.565]  By the way, really rich people don't wear diamonds, folks.
[02:19:23.565 --> 02:19:25.669]  They wear other really precious stones.
[02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:27.311]  Because they know it's all a big con game.
[02:19:27.311 --> 02:19:32.100]  I mean, I sit there and I look at the general public.
[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:32.921]  And I see...
[02:19:34.673 --> 02:19:43.796]  Just the false reality they're living in, and they really think that they're, like, making it by buying into it, and it's all giant bear traps meant to rip your legs off.
[02:19:43.796 --> 02:19:54.399]  The messages you see in mainstream media are meant to con you and destroy you, and they're the same thing as the Nigerian email where Prince Abubi is going to give you $14 million if you send him $5,000.
[02:19:54.399 --> 02:19:55.879]  You're like, listen, that's a scam.
[02:19:55.879 --> 02:19:59.040]  You're just mad because I, the prince, wants to meet with me.
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:06.283]  Every time you eat a cooked food, your body responds by producing an increase in circulating white blood cells.
[02:20:06.283 --> 02:20:11.606]  This happens because nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level.
[02:20:11.606 --> 02:20:17.689]  When we heat food to normal cooking temperatures, we change the shape of the molecules into shapes the body cannot use.
[02:20:17.689 --> 02:20:20.891]  The body now looks at them as toxins and allergens.
[02:20:20.891 --> 02:20:28.475]  In an effort to protect itself from this irritant, the body intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as garbage collectors.
[02:20:28.895 --> 02:20:34.338]  White blood cells gobble up all the unusable damaged food particles to neutralize their cell damaging properties.
[02:20:34.338 --> 02:20:39.681]  This puts stress on your organs of elimination and your body is subject to cell damage and inflammation.
[02:20:39.681 --> 02:20:46.144]  If you'd like to start experiencing the benefits of undamaged protein in your diet, give One World Way a try.
[02:20:46.144 --> 02:20:51.547]  It is a truly undamaged protein powder that will thrill your tastes and every cell of your body.
[02:20:51.547 --> 02:20:51.987]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:20:51.987 --> 02:20:52.167]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:21:00.932 --> 02:21:05.655]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:21:05.655 --> 02:21:08.777]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:21:08.777 --> 02:21:14.340]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:15.941]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:21:16.261 --> 02:21:17.902]  We are what we eat.
[02:21:17.902 --> 02:21:22.564]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:21:22.564 --> 02:21:26.786]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:21:26.786 --> 02:21:29.347]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:21:29.347 --> 02:21:35.250]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicists by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[02:21:35.710 --> 02:21:36.191]  We're good.
[02:22:00.792 --> 02:22:03.154]  So, you've decided to get prepared.
[02:22:03.154 --> 02:22:09.379]  You're not sure that a case of ramen and a couple of granola bars under your bed will cut it as long-term food storage anymore.
[02:22:09.379 --> 02:22:10.179]  You're in luck!
[02:22:10.179 --> 02:22:13.762]  At Emergency Essentials, we have all the resources to get you started.
[02:22:13.762 --> 02:22:19.126]  From three-day emergency bug-out bags to a year's supplies of food and everything in between.
[02:22:19.126 --> 02:22:22.449]  Call Emergency Essentials at 800-999-1863 or visit BePrepared.com.
[02:22:22.449 --> 02:22:23.590]  The choice is clear.
[02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:25.311]  Be unprepared or BePrepared.com.
[02:22:30.495 --> 02:22:39.802]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:39.802 --> 02:22:40.582]  This capitalism?
[02:22:40.582 --> 02:22:46.747]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:46.747 --> 02:22:50.449]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:22:50.449 --> 02:22:51.370]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.370 --> 02:22:52.451]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:22:52.451 --> 02:22:52.791]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.791 --> 02:22:53.131]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.799 --> 02:23:08.302]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[02:23:08.302 --> 02:23:12.004]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[02:23:12.004 --> 02:23:17.807]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[02:23:18.683 --> 02:23:29.914]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[02:23:29.914 --> 02:23:34.077]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[02:23:34.818 --> 02:23:43.483]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[02:23:43.483 --> 02:23:47.326]  And it's not just in response to mass murders of preparing for war.
[02:23:47.326 --> 02:23:49.767]  It's something much darker.
[02:23:49.767 --> 02:23:55.471]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[02:23:55.471 --> 02:23:56.812]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[02:24:09.839 --> 02:24:12.442]  Alright folks, we're joined by Stefan Molyneux.
[02:24:25.615 --> 02:24:27.896]  Who is a very, very interesting fellow.
[02:24:27.896 --> 02:24:29.557]  He's been on the broadcast before.
[02:24:29.557 --> 02:24:33.820]  I guess you could almost call him a hyper-libertarian or anarchic capitalist.
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:37.322]  And he's also an author of two novels.
[02:24:37.322 --> 02:24:41.804]  And I'm very excited to get him on the broadcast here today.
[02:24:41.804 --> 02:24:43.625]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:43.625 --> 02:24:46.507]  We'll jam your calls in, too, towards the end, regardless.
[02:24:46.507 --> 02:24:49.389]  I know people have been holding for a while, so we'll get to you.
[02:24:49.389 --> 02:24:51.850]  But I wanted to bring this up to Stefan.
[02:24:51.850 --> 02:24:52.871]  That's the reason I wanted to get him on.
[02:24:54.997 --> 02:24:56.493]  If you look at the world today...
[02:24:57.888 --> 02:25:00.449]  Now, more than ever, from my perspective, there is a mass awakening.
[02:25:00.449 --> 02:25:03.930]  I know I keep hammering this because it's so incredible to see it happening.
[02:25:03.930 --> 02:25:10.573]  Even the New York Sun said collapse of American influence recalls disintegration of Soviet Union, fall of France.
[02:25:10.573 --> 02:25:14.594]  Well, this is the fall of the corporate globalists that are in control of us.
[02:25:14.594 --> 02:25:25.138]  And I'm not saying it's happened yet, but the acceleration of the awakening, the people not buying into it, the rapid decline of the dominant mainstream media, they're no longer dominant.
[02:25:26.199 --> 02:25:29.881]  The rise of the new media.
[02:25:29.881 --> 02:25:39.929]  I wanted to ask Stefan Molyneux, who's a pretty smart guy, I'd almost call him a historian, where he thinks we are historically and how he thinks the empire is going to strike back.
[02:25:39.929 --> 02:25:44.112]  Or if he disagrees with me that a hyper-awakening is beginning.
[02:25:44.112 --> 02:25:46.574]  Stefan, thanks for joining us.
[02:25:46.574 --> 02:25:48.295]  Thanks Alex, it's great to be back.
[02:25:48.295 --> 02:25:48.676]  How are you doing?
[02:25:49.164 --> 02:25:51.151]  Good, so you just heard my little preface there.
[02:25:51.151 --> 02:25:54.000]  Where do you think we are culturally worldwide right now?
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.087]  Do you agree or disagree or what can you add to what I just said?
[02:25:57.642 --> 02:26:00.683]  Well, I think that we're in a fascinating place historically.
[02:26:00.683 --> 02:26:10.446]  I would argue that it's really been probably half a millennia or so since we've been in such an exciting place for the transition of humankind to a higher moral plane.
[02:26:10.446 --> 02:26:24.451]  You really, I think, would have to go back to the invention of the printing press, which took the religious texts and the Greek philosophy texts and the Roman political texts and rhetoric texts out of the hands of the monks and the priesthood and put them in the hands of the common people so people could read
[02:26:25.111 --> 02:26:31.333]  Original text and they didn't have to learn Latin, they could read in the vernacular as Martin Luther translated the Bible into the vernacular.
[02:26:31.333 --> 02:26:41.397]  This put information into the hands of the people and it had a huge effect on breaking the power of the aristocracy, of the monopoly of Christendom, which the Catholic Church had at the time.
[02:26:42.297 --> 02:26:48.000]  And it really gave people access to information that before they had to go through biased people to get.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:54.944]  Now, of course, we can get information about the world without having to go through the court toadies known as the mainstream media.
[02:26:54.944 --> 02:27:01.568]  We can actually get direct information from who are regularly called our enemies, who have a very important perspective in conflicts.
[02:27:01.568 --> 02:27:06.711]  We can get information from people passionate about truth who aren't wedded or bound into
[02:27:07.091 --> 02:27:10.372]  The systems of power that currently strangle humanity?
[02:27:10.372 --> 02:27:15.455]  91% of Americans don't want another costly war or even cheap war in the Middle East.
[02:27:15.455 --> 02:27:18.136]  They're skeptical about escalation in Syria.
[02:27:18.136 --> 02:27:19.997]  They're skeptical about what the government says.
[02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:22.778]  60% say they have little to no trust.
[02:27:23.158 --> 02:27:23.918]  In the mass media.
[02:27:23.918 --> 02:27:25.959]  So, and it's not like they don't want information anymore.
[02:27:25.959 --> 02:27:30.220]  They're just going to alternative sources, which are, I think, unbiased sources.
[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:36.562]  We don't rely, people like you and I don't rely on government handouts, which we read off and call news to our audience.
[02:27:36.562 --> 02:27:42.144]  We are responsible for going digging up the truth, no matter how painful, no matter how difficult and presenting it to people.
[02:27:42.144 --> 02:27:42.724]  And we are not
[02:27:42.844 --> 02:27:43.184]  I think so.
[02:28:08.140 --> 02:28:11.182]  Incredibly well said, and I couldn't agree more, Stefan.
[02:28:11.182 --> 02:28:12.803]  Then, let me ask you this question.
[02:28:12.803 --> 02:28:15.264]  How will the Empire strike back?
[02:28:15.264 --> 02:28:19.947]  Shouldn't we be gerting ourselves for their attempt to bully us back under their control?
[02:28:22.082 --> 02:28:29.068]  Well, force works really well in controlling a population, as long as they don't view it as force.
[02:28:29.068 --> 02:28:40.037]  The moment that the fist comes out of the glove and people see the naked might and power of the state, they recoil and they recognize that they're not free.
[02:28:40.037 --> 02:28:48.864]  You know, as long as they can camouflage the sort of tax cattle electric fences with bushes and hang little ornaments on it and say, oh, there's a nice set of bushes over there.
[02:28:49.464 --> 02:28:50.445]  Then we're fine.
[02:28:50.445 --> 02:28:55.628]  But what's happening is we are beginning to see the naked power that's behind the curtain.
[02:28:55.628 --> 02:28:57.810]  And once people see that, they recoil.
[02:28:57.810 --> 02:29:00.912]  Human beings really can only be kept in cages that they can't see.
[02:29:00.912 --> 02:29:07.837]  The moment that they see them, we turn from like domesticated dolphins into great white sharks and we'll chew our way out of the aquarium no matter what the cost.
[02:29:07.837 --> 02:29:12.260]  And I think that we're working really to show the gun in the room, which is state power, which is
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:19.785]  The power of the moneyed interests, which is the power of the cabals that run the world, that are sort of behind the media, behind even the politicians.
[02:29:19.785 --> 02:29:22.347]  We're starting to see that, which is incredible.
[02:29:22.347 --> 02:29:26.430]  All you have to do is show evil, and it will be resisted and overthrown.
[02:29:26.430 --> 02:29:33.835]  As long as evil can present itself as virtue, as protection, as law and order, as stability, well that lie is all falling apart.
[02:29:33.835 --> 02:29:37.038]  And once people see evil for what it is, it is always overthrown.
[02:29:37.358 --> 02:29:38.779]  People didn't oppose slavery.
[02:29:38.779 --> 02:29:41.420]  Stefan, stay there, folks.
[02:29:41.420 --> 02:29:42.081]  Stefan, stay there.
[02:29:42.081 --> 02:29:43.481]  We gotta get this guy on more often.
[02:29:43.481 --> 02:29:45.563]  It's like a year passed, he hadn't been on in like four.
[02:29:45.563 --> 02:29:47.123]  Stefan, amazing.
[02:29:47.123 --> 02:29:50.405]  And we're gonna come right back to you, sir.
[02:29:50.405 --> 02:29:51.806]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.806 --> 02:29:54.327]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.327 --> 02:29:57.009]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:33:02.386 --> 02:33:07.413]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.379 --> 02:33:13.062]  All right, your calls are coming up for Stefan Molyneux.
[02:33:13.062 --> 02:33:16.125]  It's freedomainradio.com.
[02:33:16.125 --> 02:33:20.309]  Hundreds of millions of people have downloaded his work just on YouTube alone.
[02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:21.930]  And that's got to really upset the globalists.
[02:33:21.930 --> 02:33:30.158]  You know, there's not just Alex Jones out there, or Ron Paul, or a Matt Drudge, or all the other great people out there that are really promoting the human awakening.
[02:33:31.112 --> 02:33:33.433]  And fighting the state-run media.
[02:33:33.433 --> 02:33:37.716]  It's that there's so many prominent people that they can't get us all.
[02:33:37.716 --> 02:33:38.836]  And we live all over the world.
[02:33:38.836 --> 02:33:41.718]  Stefan lives up in Canada, at least last time I checked.
[02:33:41.718 --> 02:33:51.503]  And I just wanted to get him on so you could get his perspective on history, on the way things work, on the mind control that the system's engaged in.
[02:33:51.503 --> 02:33:54.965]  But what he just said is what I basically said in a different way in the first hour.
[02:33:55.865 --> 02:34:01.628]  That once humans awaken to the fact that they're being persecuted, manipulated, nothing can stop us.
[02:34:01.628 --> 02:34:05.489]  If we just passively resist the system, it's over.
[02:34:05.489 --> 02:34:08.891]  But at the same time, I see it almost like triage.
[02:34:08.891 --> 02:34:18.435]  You've got so many people that have been turned into Hollywood head, narcissists who have been basically programmed to follow whatever Madison Avenue says.
[02:34:18.435 --> 02:34:21.176]  So I see that really as the biggest revolution.
[02:34:22.762 --> 02:34:29.385]  Waking up to how they program these false rights and these distractionary issues away from basic freedoms.
[02:34:29.385 --> 02:34:31.867]  And so I wanted to get your take on that.
[02:34:31.867 --> 02:34:48.175]  I'm seeing the awakening by what you call thinking people across the left, right, those paradigms shattering, people really not trusting the system and actually understanding false flag, that's now in the vernacular, that's now in the common nomenclature, and it's accelerating, but
[02:34:49.218 --> 02:35:01.121]  For those that are in the Matrix, I see them getting even more mindless, more almost like it's stylish to be stupid and to be abused and to be conned.
[02:35:01.121 --> 02:35:03.482]  What do you think is going to happen to those people?
[02:35:03.482 --> 02:35:13.324]  And can you speak to the points I've made and then add your own points about narcissism being the programming cult system?
[02:35:13.324 --> 02:35:14.985]  Because narcissism is like a
[02:35:15.285 --> 02:35:27.820]  Fake version of individualism because it's programmed by the narcissistic programmers in the media versus individualism which they then demonize and claim is some self-centered narcissism when it's actually the opposite.
[02:35:29.625 --> 02:35:31.728]  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot in there.
[02:35:31.728 --> 02:35:36.114]  Certainly, things like sociopathy, one of the most dangerous mental states, has doubled.
[02:35:36.114 --> 02:35:40.600]  Rates of sociopathy have doubled over the last 15 years, which is incredibly tragic.
[02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:45.126]  And of course, it's simply creating another crop of politicians to wrap their spiny little hands around our throats.
[02:35:45.766 --> 02:35:49.129]  But I would argue that we are distracted, of course, by materialism.
[02:35:49.129 --> 02:35:53.032]  I've always loved the challenges and complexities of the English language.
[02:35:53.032 --> 02:35:59.597]  So the word possession is something you own, but it's also a word for a devil that inhabits you and tells you what to do.
[02:35:59.597 --> 02:36:06.203]  And I think that this sort of vanity and narcissism and the focus on possessions, it's the oldest battle of philosophy.
[02:36:06.203 --> 02:36:12.208]  Do we focus on virtue and courage and strength and speaking truth to power and fighting for the freedom of all?
[02:36:13.081 --> 02:36:16.963]  Or do we want the latest iPhone and shiny toys to distract ourselves with?
[02:36:16.963 --> 02:36:26.889]  And the elites are always in the business of giving us better and more shiny toys so that we stay home playing Call of Duty rather than engage in the real fight for the future.
[02:36:26.889 --> 02:36:31.832]  But I think enough people are waking up to the urgency and the importance of what's happening.
[02:36:31.832 --> 02:36:37.936]  You know, a lot of people will see a system starting to fail philosophically, like on the basis of principles.
[02:36:38.436 --> 02:36:44.721]  When you violate the non-aggression principle, when you violate property rights, you set yourself up for conditions of significant failure.
[02:36:44.721 --> 02:36:49.826]  You can see this coming, as many Austrian economists, Ayn Rand and other thinkers did decades ago.
[02:36:49.826 --> 02:36:53.008]  But then there are other people who have to kind of hit rock bottom.
[02:36:53.008 --> 02:36:56.371]  You know, like some guy can tell you, you know, cocaine and hookers, not the way to go, man.
[02:36:56.371 --> 02:37:04.738]  But until you wake up in a Vegas ditch with some underpants on your head, naked with an armadillo attached to you in some horrible way, you just don't wake up.
[02:37:04.898 --> 02:37:13.924]  And so a lot of people now, having gone through this worst and greatest recession slash depression of the last 60 or 70 years, are recognizing that the system doesn't work and they're in search of answers.
[02:37:13.924 --> 02:37:16.886]  And before, they would have been fed the pablum.
[02:37:16.886 --> 02:37:28.414]  They would have been fed the soma of the general narrative of, well, we need more government, we need more bailouts, we need more force, we need more wars, we need more prisoners, we need more police, we need more guns in the hands of the state.
[02:37:28.414 --> 02:37:30.195]  And people aren't believing that anymore.
[02:37:30.195 --> 02:37:34.818]  Like, for instance, you don't hear people say, well, if we only spend more on public school education, they'd get better.
[02:37:34.838 --> 02:37:35.939]  We're good to go.
[02:37:50.566 --> 02:37:59.833]  Violation of property rights, less initiation of the use of force, less debt, less fiat slavery, less student debt slavery, and they're really starting to be open.
[02:37:59.833 --> 02:38:06.998]  I think we're at the end of that pendulum and starting to swing back, but dear Lord above, it requires some strong souls to push in the right direction.
[02:38:06.998 --> 02:38:12.522]  I agree with you, but take the extreme end of libertarianism.
[02:38:12.522 --> 02:38:14.924]  I then see Peter Thiel and other big globalists
[02:38:15.954 --> 02:38:21.303]  Steering the discussion where now the establishment has been tax-exempt.
[02:38:21.303 --> 02:38:22.525]  They've been above the law.
[02:38:22.525 --> 02:38:23.907]  They've had diplomatic immunity.
[02:38:24.662 --> 02:38:28.944]  And now they're kind of pushing a libertarian idea of where, okay, now they've stolen everything.
[02:38:28.944 --> 02:38:38.709]  I'm not even saying he particularly stole things, but the power structure in a command and control system where they have monopolies and oligopolies and combines and they're exempt or partially exempt.
[02:38:38.709 --> 02:38:52.197]  Now they're arguing since they've already stolen everything, oh yes, we do back a privatization, we do back a consolidation, but it's really a evil doppelganger of a true local free market system.
[02:38:53.577 --> 02:39:10.610]  So how do you respond to the concerns out there that you've got a lot of really dangerous forces that now want to segue into a lower tax, smaller government system because they've actually now become the centers of gravity themselves in corporate governance?
[02:39:12.273 --> 02:39:18.159]  Well, of course, if a farmer's, then they've tried this throughout sort of machine farming or factory farming.
[02:39:18.159 --> 02:39:25.205]  If the stalls get too small, then the cattle start banging their head back and forth and they get infections and they die.
[02:39:25.205 --> 02:39:27.567]  You can't even use their meat, let alone their milk.
[02:39:28.388 --> 02:39:32.631]  And so what the farmers do is they widen the stalls and they say, well, this is a little too confined.
[02:39:32.631 --> 02:39:36.373]  Let's just stretch that out a little bit because the cows are beating their own heads to death.
[02:39:36.373 --> 02:39:39.576]  Now, that's not they're not about to set the cows free for heaven's sakes.
[02:39:39.576 --> 02:39:49.082]  They're just trying to give a little more freedom because they found that there's too much control, too much coercion, too much top down hyper regulation.
[02:39:49.082 --> 02:39:51.924]  So what they're doing is they're going to take the shackles off the market a little bit.
[02:39:51.924 --> 02:39:52.484]  They're not dumb.
[02:39:52.484 --> 02:39:57.027]  They know that they've gone too far in the direction of fascism and totalitarianism.
[02:39:57.027 --> 02:39:58.248]  They'll take the shackles a little
[02:39:58.268 --> 02:39:59.368]  A little bit loose.
[02:39:59.368 --> 02:40:03.769]  You know, the end of a free range chicken is not freedom in the woods, it's a chicken McNugget box.
[02:40:03.769 --> 02:40:08.130]  And that's exactly where we're headed, unless we realize that we don't want bigger stalls.
[02:40:08.130 --> 02:40:10.111]  We don't want a little bit less regulation.
[02:40:10.111 --> 02:40:11.731]  We don't want lower taxation.
[02:40:11.731 --> 02:40:23.554]  We want to examine the whole question of how human society is organized and say, do we necessarily always have to have this group of soulless people with a monopoly on violence right at the center
[02:40:23.974 --> 02:40:24.674]  Of society.
[02:40:24.674 --> 02:40:28.095]  How small can we shrink this thing and still have something that functions?
[02:40:28.095 --> 02:40:32.957]  And yeah, they'll give us a little more freedom, but it's only to save their own skin.
[02:40:32.957 --> 02:40:38.759]  And most dangerously, I think, what they're going to do, as they generally do when a financial system begins to fall apart, they'll provoke a war.
[02:40:38.759 --> 02:40:41.279]  And through that war, they kill off the dependent classes, right?
[02:40:41.279 --> 02:40:43.280]  The poor, the people on welfare.
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:44.960]  This is how they kill off the dependent classes.
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:47.761]  Now, I don't think that there's going to be like a World War III.
[02:40:47.761 --> 02:40:52.883]  The nukes have rendered that pretty much impossible because actually the leaders now pay for war in a way that they didn't used to.
[02:40:53.403 --> 02:40:57.566]  But there will be a huge sacrifice, I believe, of the dependent classes.
[02:40:57.566 --> 02:40:58.967]  Welfare will be cut.
[02:40:58.967 --> 02:41:01.548]  Old age security pensions will be cut.
[02:41:01.548 --> 02:41:04.590]  And people are going to have a really, really rough time of it.
[02:41:04.590 --> 02:41:10.954]  And naturally, of course, all the people who like the free market will be blamed for this and will be told that we don't care about the poor.
[02:41:10.954 --> 02:41:21.120]  But the only people who care about the poor are those who really challenge this dependency culture and this, you know, fruits of the forced labor of others culture that is so characteristic of the United States.
[02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:26.524]  There's no doubt the welfare state is designed to create a permanent peasant class and wrecks everybody that's involved.
[02:41:26.524 --> 02:41:31.949]  And they can point out a few success stories, but they are few and far between.
[02:41:31.949 --> 02:41:35.411]  And I want to get into Syria with you and then some phone calls, but specifically
[02:41:36.551 --> 02:41:38.412]  I understand what you're saying.
[02:41:38.412 --> 02:41:41.254]  And people can say, well Alex, you know, you're saying work in the system.
[02:41:41.254 --> 02:41:49.961]  I say work in the system to make it smaller while we work culturally to wake people up to the great truths that individualism is what empowers someone.
[02:41:49.961 --> 02:41:58.026]  It's what makes them, I mean, a plant that doesn't get rained on or get, you know, wind blowing on it that grows up indoors will usually end up falling over and dying.
[02:41:58.026 --> 02:41:59.547]  It needs those stresses.
[02:41:59.547 --> 02:42:01.809]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[02:42:01.809 --> 02:42:03.450]  I understand that.
[02:42:03.450 --> 02:42:05.512]  I'm saying, how do we stop
[02:42:06.252 --> 02:42:13.541]  The Bilderbergs and other globalists and people who mainly got their money, if you look at them, from monopolies through government.
[02:42:13.541 --> 02:42:24.555]  How do we stop them from co-opting the Liberty Movement and then only selectively delivering freedom in kind of an Elysium type situation?
[02:42:26.075 --> 02:42:27.655]  Well, it's all about the principles.
[02:42:27.655 --> 02:42:33.037]  You know, I think the greatest successful revolutions in history have all been based upon principle.
[02:42:33.037 --> 02:42:37.778]  There was a principle which the Founding Fathers pursued, which was as small a government as humanly possible.
[02:42:37.778 --> 02:42:41.639]  Government is a necessary evil at best and should be kept as small as humanly possible.
[02:42:41.639 --> 02:42:42.799]  That was a principled argument.
[02:42:42.799 --> 02:42:51.361]  They had a whole Enlightenment series of philosophers behind them, making that case for the free market and a very tiny government, as they said, bound down by the chains of the Constitution.
[02:42:52.121 --> 02:42:58.726]  If you look at the end of slavery, they didn't say, well, it'll be more economically productive if we don't have slavery.
[02:42:58.726 --> 02:43:02.890]  They said, no, slavery is an unmitigatable moral evil.
[02:43:02.890 --> 02:43:06.512]  And they kept pounding the moral argument, the moral argument, the moral argument.
[02:43:06.512 --> 02:43:10.756]  That, I think, is the biggest, slowest, and most powerful lever that moves the world.
[02:43:10.756 --> 02:43:12.877]  We have to keep making the case.
[02:43:12.877 --> 02:43:15.860]  We have a right to our own money.
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:18.861]  We have a right to our own trade.
[02:43:18.861 --> 02:43:20.962]  We have a right to our own property.
[02:43:20.962 --> 02:43:24.664]  We should not have to pay off the government... We have a right to our own choices!
[02:43:24.664 --> 02:43:27.346]  ...to live in the houses that we've built with our own hands.
[02:43:27.346 --> 02:43:28.966]  We have a right to liberty.
[02:43:28.966 --> 02:43:30.727]  We have a right to freedom of communication.
[02:43:30.727 --> 02:43:31.408]  We have a right...
[02:43:32.028 --> 02:43:33.829]  To freedom from surveillance.
[02:43:33.829 --> 02:43:37.331]  And these are fundamental rights, and to violate them is a moral evil.
[02:43:37.331 --> 02:43:45.797]  We have to keep pounding that, and once people see that, nobody's pro-slavery anymore, and nobody will be pro these kinds of governmental intrusions in the future.
[02:43:45.797 --> 02:43:47.818]  But we have to keep pounding the moral argument.
[02:43:47.818 --> 02:43:51.981]  It's really slow, but I think it's the only thing that permanently changes the way people think.
[02:43:52.341 --> 02:43:53.121]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:43:53.121 --> 02:43:58.544]  I mean, look at how the psychopaths and sociopaths that run things always hammer us with dead children.
[02:43:58.544 --> 02:44:00.745]  We've got to invade because of the babies in incubators.
[02:44:00.745 --> 02:44:01.645]  Not true.
[02:44:01.645 --> 02:44:02.666]  We've got to attack Assad.
[02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:03.766]  He launched the chemical attack.
[02:44:03.766 --> 02:44:05.587]  Turns out it's not true.
[02:44:05.587 --> 02:44:10.889]  And people are now wise to this, but they program us using the fact that we do have morals.
[02:44:10.889 --> 02:44:11.970]  We do care.
[02:44:11.970 --> 02:44:20.894]  So how does the average individual that does have morals, that does have empathy, individually, how do we deal with the collectivists that are so good at punching our buttons?
[02:44:22.853 --> 02:44:25.294]  Well, I just simply ask, how does this rule apply to you?
[02:44:25.294 --> 02:44:29.955]  Whenever somebody in authority gives me a rule, I say, how does this apply to you?
[02:44:29.955 --> 02:44:32.516]  This got me in trouble even when I was in high school.
[02:44:32.516 --> 02:44:36.497]  And they said, well, you have to pass these tests in order to show us that you know stuff.
[02:44:36.497 --> 02:44:41.099]  And I remember saying to the teacher at the time, well, which test do you have to pass to prove that you're a good teacher?
[02:44:41.639 --> 02:44:48.324]  You know, my parents don't pay you voluntarily, I'm not here by choice, so how on earth, how does this rule that you're inflicting on me apply to you?
[02:44:48.324 --> 02:45:00.032]  I mean, do you know, I'm sure you know this, that the senators and congressmen who voted yes to these murderous strikes on Syria, these potential strikes on Syria... About 83% more defense money than the others.
[02:45:01.047 --> 02:45:10.532]  Yeah, I mean, all of the economic, quote, growth that has occurred over the last four or five years have been public sector jobs, the majority of which are in the military-industrial complex.
[02:45:10.532 --> 02:45:18.776]  War, and it's a tragic thing to say about a glorious nation which once was central to free trade, war is the last prop
[02:45:19.156 --> 02:45:19.576]  I think?
[02:45:49.036 --> 02:45:52.058]  Oh, but we're the world's peacemakers and policemen and so on.
[02:45:52.058 --> 02:46:00.102]  My goodness, if the police are consistently waging home invasions, we can expect the citizens to be a little suspicious about the serve and protect motto.
[02:46:00.102 --> 02:46:11.748]  By the way, the Washington Post came out with a big report over the weekend admitting, and there have been indictments, all over Maryland, they target old people they know can't take care of themselves and can't defend themselves, as predators do.
[02:46:11.748 --> 02:46:14.150]  You know, a sick gazelle, the lion goes after it.
[02:46:15.251 --> 02:46:17.932]  On people that had paid the property taxes.
[02:46:17.932 --> 02:46:24.655]  You know, the headline is people had houses taken for 44 unpaid dollars, but actually some of them, they set them up because they wanted their house.
[02:46:24.655 --> 02:46:28.596]  Well, I discovered this happening in Austin 16 years ago, and people didn't believe me.
[02:46:28.596 --> 02:46:29.877]  It later came out.
[02:46:29.877 --> 02:46:31.917]  Imagine the predatory evil.
[02:46:31.917 --> 02:46:36.659]  But really, as you would say, it's only an extension of the feudal tax on your property.
[02:46:36.659 --> 02:46:38.200]  You don't really own your property.
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:40.001]  We didn't have a property tax the last 60, 70 years.
[02:46:41.321 --> 02:46:42.322]  In this country.
[02:46:42.322 --> 02:46:54.927]  It was abolished in feudal Germany in the 1880s but they brought it back and now Germany has German citizens that fled here with their children to homeschool being sent back to have the parents put in jail for 20 years and the children taken.
[02:46:54.927 --> 02:46:58.628]  The truth is the government is a cult of criminals.
[02:46:58.628 --> 02:47:02.470]  I mean they are absolutely outrageous criminals and here is more proof.
[02:47:03.905 --> 02:47:15.474]  Well, in New York, if you don't pay your property taxes, the government has very kindly, it's very nice and generous of them, Alex, of course, they've very kindly allowed you to come and work for them for free to pay off your property taxes.
[02:47:15.474 --> 02:47:25.342]  Now, if that is not serfdom slash slavery, if this is not a ghastly little rotting leper's finger of the Middle Ages poking its way through the space-time continuum into the 21st century, what is?
[02:47:25.342 --> 02:47:33.509]  I mean, little old ladies are going there to shuffle papers and answer questions on the phone for no pay because the government has asserted a claim over their legally owned
[02:47:33.749 --> 02:47:34.009]  I don't
[02:47:54.281 --> 02:48:06.676]  Farms and how historically the problem is when you do get a free country with low taxes and regulations It becomes so wealthy that even if the tax is tiny it builds a giant government parasite and you always end up in the same place
[02:48:08.018 --> 02:48:20.005]  Yeah, this is the great lesson of the last few hundred years, and again I point to America, created philosophically, morally, as the smallest government that the human race had ever seen.
[02:48:20.005 --> 02:48:25.569]  What an incredible feat to philosophically create the smallest government the world had ever seen.
[02:48:26.508 --> 02:48:33.558]  And since then, it has grown into the very largest, the very most powerful, the most dangerous government the world has ever seen.
[02:48:33.558 --> 02:48:40.787]  With the most reach in the world, with the capacity to destroy human life many times over in countless different ways, with a prison population!
[02:48:41.568 --> 02:48:48.896]  At the moment in America that is larger than the Gulag Apokolago under Stalin.
[02:48:48.896 --> 02:48:56.085]  This is what came out of the very smallest government and the reason it happens very briefly is that a small government allows for free trade.
[02:48:56.425 --> 02:49:05.771]  Free trade creates a division of labor, and Say's Law, and all of the efficiencies that occur through that, and economic growth is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 percent per year.
[02:49:05.771 --> 02:49:06.992]  Creates massive wealth!
[02:49:06.992 --> 02:49:07.833]  Enormous wealth!
[02:49:07.833 --> 02:49:09.133]  Unprecedented wealth!
[02:49:09.133 --> 02:49:16.839]  In the United States in the 19th century, standards of livings went up many times, and the price of things went down for a hundred years!
[02:49:16.839 --> 02:49:18.200]  Can we imagine this?
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:26.105]  In this current hyperinflation, cancer-based fiat currency nightmare that we live in, that prices continually go down, that everything is like computers.
[02:49:26.625 --> 02:49:32.350]  And what happens is, as the wealth grows, the government can take more and more of that wealth, and people still feel wealthy.
[02:49:32.350 --> 02:49:38.975]  You know, if my income has doubled over the past 10 years, and my taxes have gone up 20%, I still feel richer.
[02:49:38.975 --> 02:49:43.059]  And then, what the government can do, and this is the most chilling thing that occurs, what the government can do...
[02:49:43.659 --> 02:49:50.683]  Is it can say, based upon your future taxes, it can borrow in the here and now as treasury bonds and all the national debt.
[02:49:50.683 --> 02:49:51.723]  They can say, well, you know what?
[02:49:51.723 --> 02:49:55.245]  My tax livestock, they're going to be producing a lot of taxes in the future.
[02:49:55.245 --> 02:49:57.566]  So it's like a farmer borrowing against his crop productivity.
[02:49:57.566 --> 02:49:59.407]  And they do that on the birth certificates.
[02:49:59.407 --> 02:50:00.428]  It's debt slaves.
[02:50:01.553 --> 02:50:02.593]  Yeah, it's debt slaves.
[02:50:02.593 --> 02:50:05.114]  And so what happens is they sell off the unborn.
[02:50:05.114 --> 02:50:06.914]  Talk about taxation without representation.
[02:50:06.914 --> 02:50:09.375]  You don't even exist yet and you're being taxed.
[02:50:09.375 --> 02:50:10.615]  And so they sell off the unborn.
[02:50:10.615 --> 02:50:14.816]  They create these huge debts and they use that to bribe people into here and now, which maintains their power.
[02:50:14.816 --> 02:50:16.936]  The biggest power of the king is to give gifts.
[02:50:16.936 --> 02:50:23.658]  And he gives gifts in return for supporting murder or hiding murder through stories in the mass media.
[02:50:23.658 --> 02:50:26.998]  And so you get this situation where freedom breeds tyranny.
[02:50:26.998 --> 02:50:28.999]  It's a terrible cycle that occurs.
[02:50:28.999 --> 02:50:29.279]  England
[02:50:29.959 --> 02:50:36.701]  In the 17th, 18th century was really the country along with the Netherlands that really invented what is called modern free trade.
[02:50:36.701 --> 02:50:39.961]  Got rid of mercantilism, got rid of the guilds of the Middle Ages, allowed free trade.
[02:50:39.961 --> 02:50:40.802]  And what happened?
[02:50:40.802 --> 02:50:42.542]  They became a giant empire.
[02:50:42.542 --> 02:50:45.323]  Free trade leads to empire.
[02:50:45.323 --> 02:50:52.925]  And the only way to interrupt this cycle is to really question the degree to which we can allow any institution to initiate the use of force in society.
[02:50:52.925 --> 02:50:54.465]  That's the problem, that's the problem.
[02:50:54.465 --> 02:50:58.866]  Freedom creates incredible wealth and then your grandkids become spoiled demons.
[02:51:01.365 --> 02:51:03.386]  You've thought about it for years.
[02:51:03.386 --> 02:51:05.086]  Well, the time is now.

[02:53:00.043 --> 02:53:04.766]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:53:04.766 --> 02:53:07.888]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:53:07.888 --> 02:53:13.452]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:53:13.452 --> 02:53:15.393]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:53:15.393 --> 02:53:17.014]  We are what we eat.
[02:53:17.014 --> 02:53:21.698]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:53:21.698 --> 02:53:25.920]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:53:25.920 --> 02:53:28.182]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:53:28.462 --> 02:53:34.684]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:54:05.478 --> 02:54:09.282]  Man, the broadcast just goes too long, and I've got a bunch of callers that have been holding the talk to myself.
[02:54:09.282 --> 02:54:10.323]  It's Stefan Molyneux.
[02:54:10.323 --> 02:54:13.666]  A little bit of overdrive with Stefan.
[02:54:13.666 --> 02:54:16.630]  You go up to InfoWars.com, you can see the InfoWars poll.
[02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:20.513]  How do you think the conflict in Syria will turn out?
[02:54:20.513 --> 02:54:21.615]  54% said World War III.
[02:54:21.615 --> 02:54:25.218]  I usually agree with the folks voting there, but I don't want to agree with that.
[02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:30.866]  But it does show that elites generally do expand wars when they get in trouble.
[02:54:30.866 --> 02:54:31.507]  And that's the problem.
[02:54:31.507 --> 02:54:32.889]  But Stefan, I don't want to hog anymore.
[02:54:32.889 --> 02:54:34.030]  I want to go to a few calls here.
[02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:40.419]  But briefly, how do you fix it then if liberty brings prosperity and then brings a big government?
[02:54:40.419 --> 02:54:42.743]  I guess you're saying you can't allow any government then?
[02:54:44.813 --> 02:54:57.316]  Well, again, if you're going to have the non-initiation of the use of force, I would argue that we should explore the possibility that this can be truly universalized, which means I wonder the degree to which we can have spontaneous self-organization within society.
[02:54:57.316 --> 02:55:02.817]  Now, I know it's not going to happen tomorrow, it's probably a multi-generational change, but I think we should certainly explore it.
[02:55:02.817 --> 02:55:05.158]  I don't know any way to interrupt this cycle.
[02:55:05.158 --> 02:55:10.019]  Once you have wealth in a society and a group of people who can use force at will, power corrupts.
[02:55:10.379 --> 02:55:12.320]  And there's no human being who's immune from that.
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:21.707]  I mean, I'd like to think if you gave me power over the world tomorrow, I'd do a good job, but I'd probably just slide into the same pit of slimy viciousness that seems to befall everyone else who gains power.
[02:55:21.707 --> 02:55:24.789]  So, you know, it's a funny kind of ring.
[02:55:24.789 --> 02:55:27.530]  The only thing to do is drop it in the mountain of fire.
[02:55:27.530 --> 02:55:30.612]  I just don't know any other way that we can deal with this problem in the long run.
[02:55:30.612 --> 02:55:33.014]  But again, it's generations away, I think, that kind of stuff.
[02:55:33.334 --> 02:55:50.056]  I think one big answer is having places for free people to run to, so that there's diversity, and that's why space colonies, you name it, undersea, you name it, Antarctica, the Arctic, that's why I'm so scared of the collectivists getting the global government in place, because they want to shut down competition and kind of have a monopoly.
[02:55:52.017 --> 02:56:05.820]  Yes, well certainly global government, there's this fantasy, and Sam Harris talks about it, there's this fantasy that if we have a global government we can eliminate war, because as he points out, there's no civil wars in America anymore because there's a strong federal government.
[02:56:05.820 --> 02:56:07.040]  It is really not the case.
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:13.282]  The only thing that we can say about the modern world is that instead of, you know, originally they just stole people's
[02:56:14.882 --> 02:56:19.885]  Organs for food and cannibals and so on and then they ended up stealing people's bodies for labor.
[02:56:19.885 --> 02:56:27.190]  We have at least evolved to the point where they're only stealing our money and not actually putting us to work in the fields as slaves or serfs or whatever.
[02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:34.314]  So, you know, this is the grim, slow, snail-on-a-razor-blade progress of the human species that now
[02:56:34.734 --> 02:56:35.374]  That's right, that's right.
[02:56:58.647 --> 02:56:59.627]  All right, Stefan, stay there.
[02:56:59.627 --> 02:57:02.629]  We're going to come back into overdrive, take some phone calls.
[02:57:02.629 --> 02:57:08.071]  Infowars.com is our site, PrisonPlanet.com, your site, Freedom, FreeDomainRadio.com.
[02:57:08.071 --> 02:57:13.213]  I'm going to take you out with a clip of Assad talking about what will happen if they are hit.
[02:57:13.213 --> 02:57:14.354]  Here's that clip.
[02:57:14.354 --> 02:57:17.075]  Tell me what you mean by expect everything.
[02:57:17.075 --> 02:57:19.856]  Expect every action.
[02:57:19.856 --> 02:57:21.117]  Including chemical warfare?
[02:57:22.188 --> 02:57:33.198]  That depends if the rebels or the terrorists in this region or any other group have it.
[02:57:33.198 --> 02:57:35.440]  It could happen, I don't know.
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:38.503]  I'm not a fortune teller to tell you what's going to happen.
[02:57:40.206 --> 02:57:50.970]  But we'd like to know more, and I think the President would like to know more, and the American people would like to know, you know, if there's an attack, you know, what might be the repercussions, and who might be engaged in those repercussions?
[02:57:50.970 --> 02:57:57.532]  Before the 11th of September, in my discussion with many officials in the United States, some of them are congressmen, I used to say that
[02:57:58.232 --> 02:58:02.913]  Don't deal with the terrorists as playing games.
[02:58:02.913 --> 02:58:04.314]  It's a different story.
[02:58:04.314 --> 02:58:07.155]  You're going to pay the price if you're not wise in dealing with the terrorists.
[02:58:07.155 --> 02:58:08.275]  So, nobody expected.
[02:58:08.275 --> 02:58:15.057]  We said there's going to be repercussions of the mistaken way of dealing with it, of treating the terrorism.
[02:58:15.057 --> 02:58:17.457]  But nobody expected 11th of September.
[02:58:17.457 --> 02:58:18.438]  So you cannot expect.
[02:58:18.438 --> 02:58:21.579]  It's difficult for anyone to tell you what's going to happen.
[02:58:21.579 --> 02:58:25.660]  It's an area where everything is on the brink of explosion.
[02:58:25.660 --> 02:58:26.620]  You have to expect everything.
[02:58:28.168 --> 02:58:32.572]  We have much more analysis ahead, plus more from Charlie's interview in our next hour.
[02:58:32.572 --> 02:58:35.795]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:35.795 --> 02:58:37.217]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:55.587 --> 02:58:56.848]  Tyranny is here.
[02:58:56.848 --> 02:59:00.731]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:59:00.731 --> 02:59:03.033]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:59:03.033 --> 02:59:08.877]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:59:08.877 --> 02:59:15.122]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:59:15.542 --> 02:59:21.525]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:59:21.525 --> 02:59:25.707]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening death to which our republic has fallen.
[02:59:25.707 --> 02:59:29.989]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:59:29.989 --> 02:59:35.932]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:59:35.932 --> 02:59:39.494]  It's only the beginning of the Mural Order's hellish plan.
[02:59:39.494 --> 02:59:41.475]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:59:41.475 --> 02:59:41.895]  It's here.

[02:59:53.661 --> 02:59:55.722]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.722 --> 02:59:58.924]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.939 --> 03:00:10.763]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.763 --> 03:00:12.344]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.344 --> 03:00:13.905]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.905 --> 03:00:18.088]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.088 --> 03:00:28.236]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.236 --> 03:00:29.537]  Stefan Molyneux is our guest.
[03:00:29.537 --> 03:00:30.537]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.537 --> 03:00:32.359]  Let's go to Dan in South Carolina.
[03:00:33.649 --> 03:00:35.650]  Give us his take on what's happening in the world.
[03:00:35.650 --> 03:00:37.010]  Dan, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:37.010 --> 03:00:38.211]  Go ahead.
[03:00:38.211 --> 03:00:39.311]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:00:39.311 --> 03:00:44.093]  I wanted to say, first of all, I am totally on board with what Stefan is talking about.
[03:00:44.093 --> 03:00:49.234]  It's like a nightmare.
[03:00:49.234 --> 03:00:52.376]  It's surreal, but it's true.
[03:00:52.376 --> 03:00:57.537]  But it underscores why I called you in the first place, why I've been on hold for so long.
[03:00:57.537 --> 03:00:59.558]  Because I want to mention Public Law 112-150.
[03:01:03.104 --> 03:01:07.647]  And Senate Bill 462, which is now in committee.
[03:01:07.647 --> 03:01:11.169]  It was... 462 was written in March.
[03:01:11.169 --> 03:01:25.279]  And in Section 2, Paragraph 6, it says, Congress finds that the civil war in Syria is threatening Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, which could be deployed against its own people or fall into the hands of terrorists.
[03:01:25.279 --> 03:01:26.620]  That was back in March.
[03:01:27.921 --> 03:01:31.204]  Oh yeah, they've been scripting this whole thing for a year and a half!
[03:01:31.204 --> 03:01:40.631]  I mean, that's the thing, they target their propaganda as if we're not even paying attention, because it's targeting the population that doesn't know what planet they're on.
[03:01:40.631 --> 03:01:50.418]  Well, section 3 of the 2012 version of this bill, section 3 says that it is the policy of the U.S.
[03:01:50.418 --> 03:01:55.602]  to veto any one-sided anti-Israel resolutions in the
[03:01:56.202 --> 03:01:58.563]  I mean these two bills Alex are so revealing.
[03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:27.252]  That's right, that's another great point, is how do you say what's anti-Israel to begin with, and how can you put in law something concerning another country, talking about foreign entanglements.
[03:02:27.252 --> 03:02:32.177]  In fact, let me write that down, because I was aware of that law, but give me the law again.
[03:02:33.291 --> 03:02:45.315]  Public Law 112-150, that's 2012, and then Senate Bill 462, which is now in the Foreign Relations Committee.
[03:02:45.315 --> 03:02:46.055]  That's crazy.
[03:02:46.055 --> 03:02:48.336]  Listen, listen, I appreciate you bringing that up.
[03:02:48.336 --> 03:02:50.256]  Stefan, there's an example of globalism.
[03:02:50.256 --> 03:02:51.416]  Now it's not just U.S.
[03:02:51.416 --> 03:02:52.417]  laws.
[03:02:52.417 --> 03:02:56.198]  More and more of these treaties and things were being put under other countries' laws as well.
[03:02:57.901 --> 03:03:07.425]  Yeah, which is really to say that there are no laws because, I mean, one of the things that's depressing for them, I appreciate the caller bringing it up, how many letters was it for that law?
[03:03:07.425 --> 03:03:09.966]  I mean, six, eight, ten letters or something like that?
[03:03:09.966 --> 03:03:15.869]  I mean, we really shouldn't have a legal system that's that complicated because it's impossible to obey any of these laws.
[03:03:16.089 --> 03:03:22.016]  There's some books out there that say you and I accidentally commit three felonies a day, whether we like it or not.
[03:03:22.016 --> 03:03:28.343]  You know, how about thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill, don't bear some false witness, and maybe no raping.
[03:03:28.343 --> 03:03:31.046]  I think that would be some pretty basic laws that we could all live by.
[03:03:31.046 --> 03:03:36.873]  I mean, the complexity of what the legal system has become is so monstrous that we feel like
[03:03:37.293 --> 03:03:41.035]  That scene in Brazil where Robert De Niro is getting eaten by the paper monster.
[03:03:41.035 --> 03:03:49.479]  So the idea that there are these laws in our current society, now if we're going to go into international obligations and treaties, who on earth has any clue about what is legal or not?
[03:03:49.479 --> 03:03:57.243]  The only thing that we know is that the elites are above the law because they can order, say, extraordinary rendition and torture, all of which are against international law.
[03:03:57.243 --> 03:04:00.004]  They can invade other countries against international law.
[03:04:00.004 --> 03:04:05.587]  Not only suffer no negative consequences, but, you know, get presidential libraries named after them, pensions, and speaking tours.
[03:04:07.165 --> 03:04:12.709]  They are the global mafia, but I think that their little reign is coming to an end.
[03:04:12.709 --> 03:04:14.290]  Unfortunately, folks, we're out of time.
[03:04:14.290 --> 03:04:15.411]  Sorry to the other callers.
[03:04:15.411 --> 03:04:21.376]  If Farrell and Martin and Elliot and Jeremy and others call me back tomorrow, I promise you'll go to the head of the line.
[03:04:21.376 --> 03:04:22.256]  We covered a lot of it.
[03:04:22.256 --> 03:04:25.019]  More on the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:04:25.019 --> 03:04:28.841]  Stefan, I know you're going to be back on the show very, very soon.
[03:04:28.841 --> 03:04:30.823]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[03:04:30.823 --> 03:04:31.403]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:04:31.403 --> 03:04:31.924]  A real pleasure.
[03:04:32.827 --> 03:04:33.888]  Real pleasure having you on.
[03:04:33.888 --> 03:04:34.788]  Really get people thinking.
[03:04:34.788 --> 03:04:36.169]  Smart guy.
[03:04:36.169 --> 03:04:41.232]  Folks, again, if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, it's all about free association.
[03:04:41.232 --> 03:04:42.894]  We don't make you become a member.
[03:04:42.894 --> 03:04:45.956]  I wish you would become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[03:04:45.956 --> 03:04:52.280]  So support the transmission, but more importantly, so you can share your membership with your friends and family and wake them up.
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:56.402]  We'll see you back on the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:56.402 --> 03:04:57.203]  Great job with the crew.
