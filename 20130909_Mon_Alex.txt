[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:33.760]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen here we
[00:33.760 --> 00:42.600]  are yet again kicking off another broadcast week it is the ninth day of September 2013 and we're
[00:42.600 --> 00:49.520]  approaching the 12th anniversary of 9-11 that was used if 1776 was the birth date for our
[00:49.520 --> 00:56.800]  Republic if the globalists are successful you'll be able to mark as the tombstone of our Republic
[00:56.800 --> 01:04.800]  of 9-11 the establishment is holding the Republic under the water we have got lungs full of the
[01:04.800 --> 01:12.160]  normally life-giving liquid but we're not fish so we can't breathe it and if we don't resist and
[01:12.160 --> 01:19.000]  climb out of this horse trough that they've got our head crammed into we will succumb pass out
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.560]  turn blue and die and then have our bones picked over by the parasites and why the parasites do
[01:26.560 --> 01:32.200]  that well because they're parasites that's what they do that's what their instinct directs them to
[01:32.200 --> 01:39.920]  do and you have a consortium of private banking syndicates military industrial complex big pharma
[01:39.920 --> 01:46.240]  just a collection of psychopaths sociopaths and other miscreants who have been skimming the
[01:46.240 --> 01:51.000]  cream off the top of our free market civilization but then they decided to kill the golden goose
[01:51.000 --> 01:58.840]  the golden goose that laid the golden eggs and just try to get all the eggs at one time of course
[01:58.840 --> 02:03.880]  there's really no eggs inside it's the goose that produces them but they greedily now are shutting
[02:03.880 --> 02:09.680]  that down because instinctively they don't like the liberty and the prosperity that comes from a
[02:09.680 --> 02:15.520]  free market their instinct is to extinct all competition and shoot their own feet out from
[02:15.520 --> 02:21.200]  under them you see that with the deindustrialization programs the moving the jobs to China and Mexico
[02:21.200 --> 02:27.240]  and India and 160 plus other third world countries so we're going to be breaking all that down today
[02:27.240 --> 02:34.760]  and the ultra massive developments in Syria I will come back cover all those developments and then
[02:34.760 --> 02:42.000]  in the first hour I want to open the phones up for members of the media talk show host magazine
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.720]  writers political analyst I'm always open the phones up for military to call in well why not
[02:49.720 --> 02:56.680]  open the phones up for media to call in that are listeners and to give us your take on where this
[02:56.680 --> 03:04.040]  serious situation is going and then in the second hour I want to open the phones up for
[03:04.040 --> 03:12.520]  military and the general public to call in and give us your take on what's unfolding here obviously
[03:12.520 --> 03:20.840]  Bashir Assad give an interview to Charlie Rose of CBS and we're going to air a few clips of that
[03:20.840 --> 03:27.120]  they've been trying to spin what he said that he's threatening a new 9-11 the point he made was and
[03:27.120 --> 03:32.240]  I've got the transcript that if the Al Qaeda forces the rebels get the chemicals anything could
[03:32.240 --> 03:36.880]  happen but he went on to say yeah that also anything could happen militarily against you
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.720]  of you attack us because my government and the military are not the only players of course
[03:41.720 --> 03:51.760]  he's talking about Iran and the H word Hezbollah and the media is like how dare there Assad talk
[03:51.760 --> 03:56.080]  about fighting back we've only been bringing jihadis into his country for two and a half years
[03:56.080 --> 04:03.120]  and we're only trying to pull down Egypt and put Al Qaeda in charge and big deal the protesters
[04:03.120 --> 04:09.640]  are trying to blow up ships in the Suez Canal so they're trying to spin the fact that well
[04:09.640 --> 04:13.240]  let's start a war to be fights back we'll have to have a bigger war because they know that once
[04:13.240 --> 04:17.800]  US ships are being attacked once Israel is being attacked at least they're making this
[04:17.800 --> 04:24.160]  calculation but the average American or European will say well my country right or wrong I'm gonna
[04:24.160 --> 04:33.200]  get behind this war now because after all basher fired back that dirty rat you dirty rat so we're
[04:33.200 --> 04:39.080]  gonna be breaking all that down today and then I want to talk about the california
[04:39.080 --> 04:46.480]  occasion of America on the heels of the mayor a few weeks ago announcing an emergency because
[04:46.480 --> 04:51.760]  LA is collapsing and believe me it is and like rats leaving a sinking ship they're all invading
[04:51.760 --> 05:02.240]  Austin and it is hell on earth well they're right back stay with us with over 3,000 years of

[08:06.600 --> 08:16.920]  different characteristics in different parts of the world live from austin texas broadcasting
[08:16.920 --> 08:31.000]  worldwide it's alex jones respected journalist conrad black writing for the new york sun
[08:33.080 --> 08:39.480]  over the weekend i had this to say he said the collapse of american influence recalls
[08:39.480 --> 08:49.240]  the disintegration of the soviet union the fall of france post world war two
[08:50.440 --> 08:55.880]  and i do want to go over some of this article in the next three hours today
[08:57.160 --> 09:02.520]  because you know for the last two and a half weeks i've been saying undoubtedly the fall
[09:02.520 --> 09:13.880]  of the american empires influence is in full bloom right now and the problem is historically
[09:14.920 --> 09:24.920]  that in every case when an empire begins to collapse it will expand large wars as a political
[09:24.920 --> 09:32.360]  distraction in an attempt to unify the population around primitive mob psychology or militant
[09:32.360 --> 09:42.600]  enthusiasm in fact i've done a study of this empires 100 percent of the time do this now i
[09:42.600 --> 09:46.440]  know what some of you are thinking you're going the soviet union didn't launch any attacks in
[09:46.440 --> 09:55.880]  in 1991 when they collapsed no they were already collapsing by the 1970s they were already collapsing
[09:55.880 --> 10:01.960]  the state was already collapsing it had already collapsed the people as an as an authoritarian
[10:01.960 --> 10:07.400]  instinct to dominate them and collectivize them and it was the success of the collapse of the
[10:07.400 --> 10:13.160]  individual and the family that led to the collapse of the state and no amount of automation technocracy
[10:13.160 --> 10:18.840]  robots are going to be able to hold up the new world order tyranny as it destroys the individual
[10:18.840 --> 10:22.840]  i mean they openly say they want to destroy the individual in their white papers and that somehow
[10:22.840 --> 10:28.200]  computers and robots will allow them to have their final revolution against the good people
[10:29.480 --> 10:35.480]  see psychopath sociopath scum they're at war they have enmity against the good
[10:35.480 --> 10:44.840]  and they feed us and they bamboozle us and they dumb us down as their instinct drives them towards
[10:44.840 --> 10:54.040]  control but the soviet union launched multiple wars uh in central africa uh in latin america
[10:55.080 --> 11:03.480]  in areas of asia in central asia the list goes on and on in an attempt to bolster public support
[11:03.480 --> 11:10.120]  around the military industrial complex so if i had to put a date on it the soviet union was
[11:10.120 --> 11:16.840]  really pretty much collapsing from the late 70s on to the mid-80s and then just officially collapsed
[11:16.840 --> 11:25.240]  when their only engine of production that was left east germany collapsed and for four or five years
[11:25.240 --> 11:30.440]  before east germany officially collapsed when the military and police just stood down and stopped
[11:30.440 --> 11:39.560]  oppressing the people the lives of others details a true story in retrospective of just one snapshot
[11:39.560 --> 11:48.760]  case i suggest you watch it to understand what tyranny's like and so we've now basically entered
[11:48.760 --> 12:03.400]  those waters i would liken the united states to 1987 east germany about 1987 east germany
[12:03.960 --> 12:10.920]  1989's very very close and by the way the social engineers know all this and so they have the
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.000]  homeland security and the armored vehicles and the checkpoints and george washington and
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.600]  thomas jefferson are bad and libertarians are bad and returning veterans are bad and gun owners
[12:20.600 --> 12:24.760]  are bad and christians are bad pretty much anybody that knows how to tie their shoelaces
[12:26.040 --> 12:31.080]  the only people who aren't bad in the new america are people that just laugh at everything and say
[12:31.080 --> 12:37.800]  i don't care everything's gonna be fine i can't tell you how many entertainers i've talked to
[12:37.800 --> 12:43.240]  how many rock stars i've talked to how many media people i've talked to who say listen i totally agree
[12:43.240 --> 12:49.560]  with what you say behind the scenes i've been told shut up and i'll be given the big contract
[12:50.600 --> 12:55.800]  in some cases for you i mean we're talking let's not exaggerate 100 million dollars
[12:57.240 --> 13:03.240]  20 million dollars and they're told you shut up some of them that have already spoken out
[13:03.240 --> 13:07.960]  and you'll get a new contract and folks they're given a contract six months later when they shut
[13:07.960 --> 13:13.560]  up and sign a contract shut up people are given contracts and told here's your money to shut up
[13:13.560 --> 13:16.840]  and by the way here's your agenda you're supposed to push right now
[13:23.160 --> 13:27.000]  and so when i see childlike people make fun of us in the national media
[13:27.880 --> 13:30.600]  a lot of times i end up talking to them behind the scenes they're not childlike they've been
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.560]  told to do what they're doing but still some of them local talk show host other people literally
[13:35.560 --> 13:41.160]  are childish and mimic the talking points thinking they'll get a job with the establishment if they
[13:41.160 --> 13:47.240]  just play patty cake with the official narrative let me explain something the official narrative
[13:47.240 --> 14:00.120]  is going down the united states as we know it is not going to exist anymore and we better be deciding
[14:00.120 --> 14:04.440]  if we want to have the republic reborn and prosperity and go back to being a nation
[14:04.440 --> 14:10.520]  or whether we want to just be some third world backwater that supplies hessian mercenaries for
[14:10.520 --> 14:19.000]  the new eu un nato world government because the plan is to squeeze us for a jenna 21 to fund the
[14:19.000 --> 14:27.160]  world government and to use that impoverishment by scientific metric by scientific actuary
[14:27.160 --> 14:30.680]  as the tool of political oppression because what they've done is they've just
[14:30.680 --> 14:37.160]  turned it into a science what their tyranny already does and again they all write books
[14:37.160 --> 14:42.840]  ran corporation you name it we've cited them here i've made films about it where they admit all this
[14:43.800 --> 14:49.000]  and then rationalize it that it's it's a good thing to do because prosperity is bad for the
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.600]  environment and for the carbon footprint but of course not for them with their jet copters and jets
[14:54.600 --> 15:01.080]  and you know 15 mistresses and palaces and private islands and red carpets and no no you're not going
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.240]  to have air conditioning you're not going to have a car and by the way you're not even going to have
[15:05.240 --> 15:09.640]  a job because let me give you the little newsflash all you trendies that have bought into this and go
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.960]  to Whole Foods and buy you know the racks are full of magazines about how cool it is to be poor
[15:13.960 --> 15:19.720]  and everything let me explain something to you they're bankrupting you and they've set up the
[15:19.720 --> 15:26.520]  rural affairs commission under the Pentagon to shut down all independent agriculture and they're
[15:26.520 --> 15:31.880]  going to shut everything off in increments and then carry out basically high-tech red terror
[15:31.880 --> 15:38.760]  operations okay you're going to be forcibly inoculated you're going to die young of weaponized
[15:38.760 --> 15:45.800]  cancer you've been injected with we're already deeply into this program and here's a little
[15:45.800 --> 15:51.000]  newsflash the Pentagon's listening and they know I'm telling the truth and these Pentagon operatives
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.920]  go home and look at their lives and children at night and they know everything I'm saying is dead
[15:54.920 --> 16:01.400]  on accurate they're going and being decompartmentalized and looking up what I'm saying and finding out
[16:01.400 --> 16:07.000]  it's all true and connecting the dots it's not even connected the dots it's it's it's like a
[16:07.000 --> 16:16.680]  caller said yesterday this is painting by colors now or painting by numbers and I'm sorry reality
[16:16.680 --> 16:21.880]  is really scary and really wild but here's the good part about reality the globalist are flesh
[16:21.880 --> 16:27.480]  and blood just like us that have built themselves up to this godlike status with our tax money and
[16:27.480 --> 16:33.880]  our energy the minute we realize they're predatory enemies the minute we realize their systems bad
[16:33.880 --> 16:40.680]  for us and is only going to get worse and then that it's us or them the moment we commit to
[16:40.680 --> 16:47.000]  absolutely do everything we can to sabotage them every day with targets of opportunity in the info
[16:47.000 --> 16:54.920]  war is one step closer to politically pulling that razor's edge across their carotid arteries
[16:55.880 --> 16:59.080]  and let me tell you folks the new world order if you want to use that analogy is already
[16:59.080 --> 17:03.560]  holding its neck we already slit one wide open blood spraying all over the walls right now
[17:03.560 --> 17:09.400]  we need to just dig in pull it in all the way across reach into the new world order and give
[17:09.400 --> 17:14.360]  them a columbia necktie okay that's what needs to happen because it's us or them you understand that
[17:14.360 --> 17:18.760]  this is a death battle ladies and gentlemen and their blood spraying all over the walls right now
[17:19.960 --> 17:25.240]  you have to understand so is ours this is a death battle we've got like hatchets basically
[17:25.240 --> 17:30.920]  hacking each other up right now and if I can just get the american people and the people of the world
[17:30.920 --> 17:37.240]  to realize how serious this is and trigger our life force our survival mechanisms our survival
[17:37.240 --> 17:42.760]  instincts that we all have you're all weaponized ladies and gentlemen humans are incredible creatures
[17:42.760 --> 17:48.680]  if I can get you to turn on your weaponized systems and just admit you're under attack it's all over
[17:48.680 --> 17:56.520]  folks it's time to go weaponized it's time to activate your survival instincts right now
[17:56.520 --> 18:01.320]  and you got to do that first to admit we're under attack okay in the minute you admit that
[18:02.120 --> 18:06.120]  you're a cop you're in the military you get it because you understand that the general public
[18:06.120 --> 18:11.000]  though the minute you go research what I say no matter how far out it sounds like science fiction
[18:11.000 --> 18:19.160]  you're in 2013 folks and the globalists are 30 years advanced we're like 2050 2045 in real
[18:19.160 --> 18:24.520]  technological development that's why they're on such power trips the minute you become conscious
[18:24.520 --> 18:30.440]  of all of this is the minute we turn the tide and by the way we're at the tipping point right now
[18:32.520 --> 18:39.240]  every analyst that I respect is saying the same thing and of course you notice that I've always
[18:39.240 --> 18:45.080]  said our main goal is to collapse the globalist empire because we pay for it it's immoral it's
[18:45.080 --> 18:52.760]  fraudulent and at its heart it's a eugenicist empire they always sell the idea that oh this big empire
[18:52.760 --> 18:57.400]  they sell to the intelligentsia to the general public they tell you there's no empire there's
[18:57.400 --> 19:03.320]  no corruption they sell the average yuppie the average person making 200 000 dollars a year who
[19:03.320 --> 19:07.800]  thinks they're a member of the elite that if you buy into all this and you buy into the corruption
[19:07.800 --> 19:13.160]  you buy into the lies and you buy into okay they planted wmds but so what that's how we get the
[19:13.160 --> 19:22.040]  oil we're paying more now than we were back in 2003 for oil folks it's designed so that we don't
[19:22.040 --> 19:29.640]  get cheap oil saddam's crime was selling cheap oil and that's just one little microcosm example
[19:29.640 --> 19:36.280]  of how just because you delusionally believe and imagine that you're part of the power structure
[19:36.280 --> 19:42.280]  doesn't make it so and i'm gonna talk about that at the bottom of the next hour i'm gonna talk about
[19:42.280 --> 19:48.440]  how we've been given artificial narcissistic personalities to be programmed and how we can
[19:48.440 --> 19:54.280]  deprogram ourselves but first i'm gonna come back and break down the latest bombshell developments
[19:54.280 --> 20:02.040]  on the serious situation but the bigger story is the mass awakening there are those curious
[20:02.040 --> 20:08.760]  about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins what are bitcoins a bitcoin is the

[24:30.680 --> 24:36.200]  news i would like to open the phones up though when i do specifically for radio talk show host
[24:37.080 --> 24:44.360]  uh writers people in the media what is your take on the collapse of confidence not only in the
[24:44.360 --> 24:51.000]  obama administration but in congress and in the mainstream media and you disagree with me that
[24:51.000 --> 24:59.400]  this signifies a major tipping point a sea change i mean it undoubtedly is the question is will
[24:59.400 --> 25:03.880]  this sea change be successful in fact here is the toll free number i'd like to get your take from a
[25:03.880 --> 25:12.120]  media perspective on this 800 259 92 31 you don't need to say who you are you can't have you want to
[25:12.120 --> 25:18.920]  uh but i'd rather just you know say i'm in radio i'm in tv i'm in print i'm in film here is my take
[25:18.920 --> 25:28.840]  on this but but from folks that have actually done something in the media 800 259 92 31 800
[25:28.840 --> 25:37.640]  2599 231 now the system is counting on ignorance that is the ocean in which these tyrants uh these
[25:37.640 --> 25:44.200]  these leviathans swim but you've got over two and a half years ago the west injecting the rebels
[25:44.200 --> 25:50.120]  that are now committing incredible atrocities against christians making them convert to islam
[25:50.120 --> 25:56.680]  or having their heads chopped off that's now mainstream news burning bibles and mass blowing
[25:56.680 --> 26:09.320]  up churches and then meanwhile we've got uh obama coming out and saying hey i was hired i was elected
[26:09.320 --> 26:14.520]  to in wars and i want to end the war in syria basically the same thing he said last week war is
[26:14.520 --> 26:24.200]  peace that's what he said but the west nato the us israel saudi arabia who's right at the heart of
[26:24.200 --> 26:30.760]  it bankrolling it they're spreading the sunni empire i think against sunni muslims folks but
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.400]  you know it's the majority it's the group the global aside with it's the shock forces and i do
[26:35.400 --> 26:41.960]  have something against the radical sunni jihadist and al qaeda and some people in the israeli papers
[26:41.960 --> 26:48.040]  go well we're helping knock out our you know iran's ally with our enemy al qaeda look come on al qaeda
[26:48.040 --> 26:55.080]  has been used to attack israel that came out in haritz years ago in jerusalem post in in fake al qaeda
[26:55.080 --> 27:01.800]  attacks you search that headline so that you could take israeli's liberties and also arabs that live
[27:01.800 --> 27:06.920]  in israel take their freedoms the military industrial complex whether it's in russia or israel
[27:06.920 --> 27:13.240]  whether it's in the us or south africa stands to gain from crises and israel wants a piece of syria
[27:13.240 --> 27:20.200]  a lot more than they got with the golan heights and it is despicable and i've seen some spin out
[27:20.200 --> 27:29.880]  there that it's anti-semitic if i don't support israel supporting al qaeda as a proxy in syria
[27:30.440 --> 27:37.960]  and again um if people in israel criticize this they get criticized you'll do what the central
[27:37.960 --> 27:43.400]  government says or you're a racist you'll support obama care or you're a racist you'll turn your
[27:43.400 --> 27:49.160]  guns in or you're a racist it's the same the same political correctness which is really just a weapon
[27:49.160 --> 27:56.040]  we're going to call you bad names if you don't go along with this meanwhile i'm criticized by the
[27:56.040 --> 28:02.840]  giant other religious group the anti-israel crowd that that's a religion who absolutely see me as the
[28:02.840 --> 28:12.520]  devil because all of their bullying has not made me join them i will continue to be credible and
[28:12.520 --> 28:18.680]  really address things geopolitically on how they stand not on which group i'm in i'm in the group
[28:18.680 --> 28:23.800]  that promotes liberty and freedom for all i'm in the group that promotes due process and family
[28:23.800 --> 28:29.720]  values and the second amendment and i believe there are people from every group that support that but
[28:29.720 --> 28:35.960]  here is obama saying he needs to end the war but nobody points out the war his handlers started
[28:35.960 --> 28:43.880]  here it is i was elected to end wars and not start them i've spent the last four and a half years
[28:43.880 --> 28:51.960]  doing everything i can to uh reduce our reliance on military power using al qaeda i also know is
[28:51.960 --> 28:58.120]  that there are times where um we have to make hard choices if we're going to stand up for the things
[28:58.120 --> 29:02.680]  that we care about that's enough and that's the same species been giving the things we care about
[29:02.680 --> 29:09.480]  and he goes on to say fighting evil Assad was attacking nobody Assad was westernizing Assad
[29:09.480 --> 29:15.800]  was opening up Assad wanted to have resorts there and wanted westerners to come Assad grew up in
[29:15.800 --> 29:22.840]  england Assad was having elections in the regional governments and they used that openness to then come
[29:22.840 --> 29:29.800]  in and destabilize the country and then they criticize the country is cracking down just like
[29:29.800 --> 29:34.680]  they're doing egypt oh egypt you won't let al qaeda murder all the christians and all the jews that
[29:34.680 --> 29:41.320]  live there you're anti-semitic or you're i mean it's amazing that that these are such tyrants but
[29:41.320 --> 29:46.280]  because they're called liberals it's supposedly okay well they're right back stay with us

[37:50.040 --> 37:54.440]  weapons bases that every major government the world has our media plays on ignorance like
[37:54.440 --> 37:58.040]  we should innovate them they have chemical weapons the united states has more chemical
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.440]  weapons than anybody in the world let's just get that straight okay and that means the criminals
[38:02.440 --> 38:06.520]  that have hijacked this nation do and so we've got that going on
[38:09.480 --> 38:14.200]  so now carrie came out and said you were given one week this is all over the news

[39:27.400 --> 39:32.920]  collapsed and there's just this this destabilization by globalist forces to collapse all this real
[39:32.920 --> 39:38.200]  estate and these civilizations to come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar and then a sod
[39:38.200 --> 39:45.720]  gives a i watched the whole charlie roe's interview last night and
[39:47.880 --> 39:51.560]  a sod says things like i guess there could be chemical weapons if the rebels get control
[39:53.080 --> 39:57.320]  i've got the transcript right here you and the media is like a sod threatens chemical attack
[39:58.200 --> 40:01.720]  they go well will will you attack your neighbors you go well it's not just us
[40:02.760 --> 40:06.760]  there are other forces in the middle east that are going to respond and yeah it's going to be bad
[40:06.760 --> 40:13.400]  i.e. Hezbollah and iran and they spin that like a sod is threatening a new 9 11 and i was
[40:13.400 --> 40:18.360]  listening to the radio this morning national radio i'm not going to invite somebody to even
[40:18.360 --> 40:22.920]  say who but you can imagine i was going back and forth between npr and a big national show this
[40:22.920 --> 40:29.720]  on the morning you all probably heard similar stuff i saw i was seeing it earlier today the
[40:29.720 --> 40:38.360]  talking point the talking point is that see he's going to do another 9 11 basher a sod ladies and
[40:38.360 --> 40:45.640]  gentlemen is secular basher a sod has been fighting actual al-qaeda for two years nine months
[40:46.200 --> 40:50.760]  keep saying two and a half years is actually more than that now it'll be three years in december
[40:51.720 --> 40:57.640]  this stuff all kicked off december three years ago basically and you could go there and stay in
[40:57.640 --> 41:02.120]  a hotel and go to the beach okay in syria you could go to the oldest markets in that area of the
[41:02.120 --> 41:07.880]  world you could go see roman and bizantine ruins in fact if i wanted to go to israel sometime
[41:08.920 --> 41:12.920]  i've been to europe i wanted to go to israel and see that incredible history i wanted to then
[41:13.560 --> 41:18.840]  go to syria i wanted to then go to roam because i had never been to italy that was a trip i was
[41:18.840 --> 41:24.200]  planning someday a dream trip i'm not going to be able to ever go to syria folks i mean they've got
[41:24.200 --> 41:30.520]  roman ruins better than what they've got in roam there okay i mean just in fact type into google
[41:30.520 --> 41:38.280]  search engine to click images roman ruins syria i mean it is incredible whole cities just out in
[41:38.280 --> 41:43.480]  the desert columns and buildings and stuff that makes the parthenon and grease look like that's
[41:43.480 --> 41:49.560]  all being blown up right now because the jihadis hate any culture that isn't saudi arabian bedouin
[41:49.560 --> 41:53.720]  or whatever they're blowing up some of the oldest churches in the world i don't have to tell you
[41:53.720 --> 41:59.000]  this it's finally on the news and they're putting people to the sword that don't join it i mean it
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.920]  is look at those ruins by the way they're shelling those i saw that this weekend and almost cried
[42:07.400 --> 42:12.920]  i mean it just goes on and on i said i'd go to your calls this is just this is making me so sick
[42:14.120 --> 42:18.360]  and then and then it's the tragedy of the ignorance of the public that yeah they're waking
[42:18.360 --> 42:24.680]  up but not fast enough because obama says he's got to clean up the war and stop the death i mean
[42:25.240 --> 42:31.560]  this is like jeffrey dommer having a press conference and saying you know i need to protect
[42:31.560 --> 42:37.720]  kids in the neighborhood and you're like but you shot video of you killing people and injecting
[42:37.720 --> 42:42.120]  acid in their brains to make them zombies sex slaves and and and you know all these bodies
[42:42.120 --> 42:46.360]  in your refrigerator and drums and he's sitting there eating a you know a forearm going what's
[42:46.360 --> 42:53.000]  big deal i mean they're the authors of it they did it they're trying to overthrow
[42:53.800 --> 42:59.880]  egypt right now and trying to put al qaeda in forget muslim brotherhood folks i've seen the
[42:59.880 --> 43:07.880]  films you've seen the i mean it's al qaeda flags it's it's the real deal and this this is them
[43:07.880 --> 43:14.840]  going too far i mean will they get away with this is the question and by the way i'll cover this next
[43:14.840 --> 43:19.400]  hour after i take calls and continue with calls we do have breaking news on the missing nukes dais
[43:19.400 --> 43:26.440]  air force base dais refuses to deny secret nuke transfer we're now six days into this it'll be a
[43:26.440 --> 43:35.640]  week tomorrow and they have refused on their own facebook to deny it and we've talked to them i don't
[43:35.640 --> 43:41.000]  know like six seven times videotaped it you've seen those videos we put out they will not deny it
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.800]  still so there you go what does that tell you because if they weren't transferring nukes they'd
[43:45.800 --> 43:50.280]  say this story is completely erroneous i have to know lindsay gramm's gotten thousands of calls
[43:50.280 --> 43:55.880]  they've gotten thousands at dais we call up and they go is this about the weapons transfer
[43:55.880 --> 44:00.680]  we're like yeah well we're we'll call you back in a few hours and then they never do and we call
[44:00.680 --> 44:04.840]  back the next day you know you said captain that you were gonna call us back no i didn't i never said
[44:04.840 --> 44:12.200]  that call them back the next day i never talked to you yeah you told us you'd call us back no i didn't
[44:13.240 --> 44:18.280]  well yeah we have video of it nope didn't i mean just just just unbelievable dais refuses
[44:18.280 --> 44:22.040]  is a nice secret nuke transfer but then we discovered well i mean i knew about this hiding in plain
[44:22.040 --> 44:28.360]  view but the pan tex giant nuclear weapons manufacturing and decommissioning facility
[44:28.360 --> 44:32.680]  the biggest in the united states in fact they say most of it's done there i love how it's got
[44:32.680 --> 44:37.720]  guard towers and bar bar facing in very very interesting my military personnel's sources
[44:37.720 --> 44:44.520]  have said that is a fema camp as well it's a gigantic facility and you can go look at images
[44:44.520 --> 44:50.680]  of them with warheads and i've just been told by sources that don't want to get in trouble
[44:50.680 --> 44:57.160]  that i should look at the pan tex facility and that that's where the nukes came from
[44:57.160 --> 45:01.720]  that they were just going through dais and that something else was being picked up at dais and
[45:01.720 --> 45:06.680]  that's a separate source and are other sources but obviously folks can't give you a lot of info
[45:06.680 --> 45:11.000]  when they've signed national security agreements you see what happens to whistleblowers but
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.960]  it is illegal to just have these things disappear in trucks to south carolina
[45:15.960 --> 45:19.960]  with lindsay graham saying brace for nukes to go off but we're going to go to your calls
[45:19.960 --> 45:26.360]  we're going to go to chris tv producer alex rider blogger ronald's a journalist drew the talk show
[45:26.360 --> 45:32.760]  host and julio is listing on 15 30 am wckg in chicago i know he is because he's done reporting
[45:32.760 --> 45:37.080]  for us and broken some national news stories we're going to get to all of you into the next hour
[45:37.080 --> 45:46.840]  here in just a few minutes but first here is basher with charlie rose mr cfr uh saying i
[45:46.840 --> 45:51.880]  didn't do the chemical attack and by the way all hell's going to break list of you attack us i mean
[45:51.880 --> 45:57.480]  obviously and then the media is like oh he's so threatening the west is starting this folks
[45:58.680 --> 46:02.440]  i mean can i just walk up the smile the streets done nothing break their nose the cops get there
[46:02.440 --> 46:08.440]  and i go you know after i punched him in the nose officer he uh he uh threatened to punch me back
[46:08.440 --> 46:13.560]  you know i've been punching this guy in the face for almost three years and uh doing all this and
[46:13.560 --> 46:17.880]  cutting off everything and now he's threatening to fight back i mean the cops would go well you
[46:17.880 --> 46:22.200]  just assaulted him you're going to jail i mean this is just common law ladies and gentlemen but
[46:22.200 --> 46:26.600]  stand the cops go well here let me just shoot him for you boom boom boom boom boom and the
[46:26.600 --> 46:30.680]  guys wriggling on the ground bleeding to death they're like man look at him his blood is dripping
[46:30.680 --> 46:38.040]  on the ground he might give us hiv he's a terrorist arrest that dying man i mean it's just it beggars
[46:38.040 --> 46:46.280]  common sense let's go to a little clip of basher what was your reality on august 21st uh
[46:46.280 --> 46:53.000]  what happened in your judgment we we're not in the area where the alley where the where the
[46:53.000 --> 46:58.840]  alleged chemical attack was happened as it alleged we're not sure that anything happened
[46:58.840 --> 47:03.880]  even at this date you are not sure the chemical weapons even though you have seen the videotape
[47:03.880 --> 47:09.240]  even though you've seen the bodies even though no your own officials have been there i haven't
[47:09.240 --> 47:17.240]  finished our soldiers in another area were attacked chemically our soldiers they went to the hospital
[47:17.960 --> 47:23.640]  as casualties because of chemical weapons but in the area where they said the government used
[47:23.640 --> 47:30.920]  chemical weapons we only had video and we only have pictures and allegations were not there
[47:30.920 --> 47:37.800]  our forces our police our institutions don't exist how can you talk about what happened
[47:37.800 --> 47:43.160]  we don't have evidence we're not like the american administration we're not social media administration
[47:43.160 --> 47:47.560]  or government we are the government that deal with reality well when we have evidence of who
[47:47.560 --> 47:53.480]  did not uh well as you know secretary carrey has said there's evidence that they saw rockets
[47:53.480 --> 48:00.200]  fired from a region controlled by your forces into a region controlled by the rebels all right
[48:00.200 --> 48:05.560]  folks they have evidence so so what's happening is the emperor's new clothes the fact that the
[48:05.560 --> 48:13.960]  emperor is actually butt naked is now all coming out and at the bottom of the next hour i'm going
[48:13.960 --> 48:21.160]  to break down exactly how the emperor's new clothes and that idea is what's controlling our society
[48:21.160 --> 48:27.080]  because the federal reserve is not federal it is a total fraud the globalist do run al-qaeda
[48:27.080 --> 48:33.080]  on record the globalists did start this war the rebels have shot all these videos bragging that
[48:33.080 --> 48:39.240]  they did it that's been picked up and now national french and italian tv have interviewed people
[48:39.240 --> 48:44.760]  that were kidnapped by al-qaeda and held and then ransomed out this is up on info wars.com
[48:45.320 --> 48:53.880]  very important story and they're saying no we were held by them and they bragged that basher
[48:53.880 --> 49:00.280]  hadn't done it and that the chemical attack was launched by them to bring in the us and that
[49:00.280 --> 49:06.280]  they were going to win now and so europe is all seeing this now right now here's the headline
[49:06.280 --> 49:12.520]  on info wars.com kidnap teacher rebels said Assad not behind chemical weapons attack and the reason
[49:12.520 --> 49:19.480]  that article is so important is that it shows all the other past videos of them launching chemicals
[49:19.480 --> 49:23.720]  and admitting it and everything see that's the issue the system thinks we're so ignorant they're
[49:23.720 --> 49:29.160]  going to have the rebels brag about this publicly while charlie rose and everybody shakes their
[49:29.160 --> 49:36.200]  finger and Assad says come on you know you did it it's amazing let's go to this clip of Assad
[49:36.200 --> 49:40.120]  talking about expect everything here it is tell me what you mean by expect everything
[49:40.760 --> 49:51.000]  expect every action including chemical warfare that depends if the if the rebels or the
[49:51.000 --> 49:59.240]  terrorists in this region or any other group have it it could happen i don't know we don't
[49:59.240 --> 50:05.480]  i'm not fortune teller to tell you what's going to happen but we'd like to know more and i think
[50:05.480 --> 50:09.480]  the president would like to more american people like to know you know if there's an attack you
[50:09.480 --> 50:15.400]  know what might be the repercussions and who might be engaged in those repercussions before the
[50:15.400 --> 50:19.320]  11th of september in my discussion with many officials in the united states some of them are
[50:19.320 --> 50:27.320]  congressmen i used to say that don't deal with the terrorists in as playing games it's a different
[50:27.320 --> 50:31.800]  story you're going to pay the price if you're not wise in dealing with the terrorists so nobody
[50:31.800 --> 50:37.880]  expects they're going to be repercussions of the second way of dealing with it all right there you
[50:37.880 --> 50:42.280]  go let's stop right there he's still if you read the transcript carefully saying you turn this
[50:42.280 --> 50:46.200]  country over to terrorists there's gonna be big problems and there's other players in the region

[55:50.200 --> 55:57.960]  conflict from a media perspective it's quite fascinating to see the large public outcry
[55:57.960 --> 56:03.560]  in this internet age we're living in that it was so many people not just in europe but here in the
[56:03.560 --> 56:11.720]  u.s are very animate against us on both sides of the political spectrum and the media from corporate
[56:11.720 --> 56:16.520]  media to the alternative media or the alternative media really forced corporate media with your
[56:16.520 --> 56:22.840]  hard work and others to really shine a light on this issue to admit yes that al qaeda is actually
[56:22.840 --> 56:29.080]  being funded by the united and now it's on face the nation everywhere that actually there isn't
[56:29.080 --> 56:35.160]  proof uh we don't know who did the chemical stuff i mean it's amazing that's why i want to talk to
[56:35.160 --> 56:40.280]  media folks what is your take on the sea change how big is it and how do you expect the empire to
[56:40.280 --> 56:47.720]  strike back it's huge alex it's a it's a total game changer you know with libya it was kind of the
[56:47.720 --> 56:53.000]  first push to where we are currently but it's a total game changer it's like a slap in the face
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.880]  earlier kind of a face to these corporate media outlets that are and it's not just on this issue
[56:57.880 --> 57:04.520]  it affects everything it's not even a game changer it's a sport changer the sport of life i mean it is
[57:04.520 --> 57:12.120]  a global total shift i'm telling you and what i think it's coming up next i think the u.s is on
[57:12.120 --> 57:19.160]  high alert and i'm not just saying this this is through uh a texas fusion center document uh from
[57:19.160 --> 57:24.920]  the texas department of homeland security they're talking about a potential threat uh the the fbi
[57:24.920 --> 57:30.840]  this month or a couple months ago released an aviation alert for potential tax uh they're
[57:30.840 --> 57:35.800]  throwing this out there and quickly on the nukes thing you talked about uh what happened with your
[57:35.800 --> 57:41.480]  sources about nuke transfers i'm reading a document from the department of defense it was updated
[57:41.480 --> 57:48.760]  august 15th of 2013 and it's uh the department of department of defense transportation of
[57:48.760 --> 57:56.120]  us nuclear weapons and it's a brand new update on how you should safely transport nuclear weapons
[57:56.120 --> 58:03.160]  and it mentions that all nuclear weapon transportations throughout the u.s uh has to get approval
[58:03.160 --> 58:08.600]  from the joint chiefs of staff so maybe that's another lead for you alex the look into what's
[58:08.600 --> 58:13.960]  going on with your sources down in texas with the nuke transfers you know that's why they're that's
[58:13.960 --> 58:18.040]  why they're freaking out because you're it but they didn't see any paperwork it was just the
[58:18.040 --> 58:23.640]  base commander and then now we're six days in and we call them on air we've been releasing these
[58:23.640 --> 58:28.840]  videos where we tape it and they will not deny it and then you got lindsay graham saying brace for

[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:21.480]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.560]  we're now into hour number two and the whole fraud that is the move to expand the war and
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:46.440]  the war crimes in syria uh it is all disintegrating right now the question is how will the empire
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:52.440]  strike back how does the collapse and confidence in the government in the uh kleptocratic eugenics
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:01:03.240]  based institutions and in the decepticon media the uh ovomet supporting media how is that going to
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:09.800]  play out uh the only reason singing in and all the rest of them are having to admit now that the al-qaeda
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.360]  is killing christians then it's a very immoral war is because they need to keep some confidence they
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:23.560]  have left in the public but it's already gone that song already played and i'm looking at all the
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:28.520]  angles they've known this is coming brazinski's written about it the last few years and he's one
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:34.040]  of the top strategists the globalists have right now that their answer is going to be an iron fist
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.120]  stage stuff it won't matter if we know they staged it they'll still just kind of act like well
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.280]  we're doing this for your safety even though everybody knows that's not the case that a little
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:49.400]  bit of plausible deniability they think will keep people from speaking out against the system
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:54.520]  and i'm sorry i don't think that's going to work especially when the military and police that i
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:01.400]  talked to are really waking up because as bad as the federalization of police is
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:09.320]  and as bad as the brainwashing they're being given is it's actually backfired in many areas
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.520]  and that's why i am reticent to just come out and demonize the police especially the military
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.480]  even though they are the instruments the globalists want to use to oppress us
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:27.320]  and enslave us that is the group that i see statistically waking up faster than anybody
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:34.760]  so to a great extent our hope lies in them but also our doom and that's kind of how it always
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.760]  is it's like america is the best of times the worst of times the best of places the worst of
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:44.680]  places we do have a special destiny that's that's clear as the founders knew and those before them
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:51.480]  and the question is what is that special destiny well the destiny of the world to a great extent
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:03:00.520]  will be decided here in america the new jerusalem as the establishment sees it israel is not seen
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:08.200]  by the high-level limonade as the real center of the world it's the united states and it goes back
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:14.120]  to the rosa crucians and others over 500 years i don't want to get off into a bunch of esoteric
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.760]  stuff whether you believe in all this or not america's secret destiny
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:30.040]  is to bring in a new age of enlightenment and human empowerment now that's what one group thought
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:36.440]  the group that wore the white hats whether you think they were devils or not the black magic crew
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:44.440]  that's always operated within the illuminati and is the illuminati they just want to create
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:50.440]  absolute hell on earth and think they're going to be gods over some dark kingdom now i've said enough
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.840]  i'm going to come back and i'm going to go directly to drew ronald alex and chris you just
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.640]  joined us i want to hear from media people journalists about the shift we've seen where

[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.440]  into the second hour here today huge developments in the economy with the police state with the
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.400]  program of cloward and piven to bankrupt america to collapse everyone under government controlled
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.760]  and we've got big Benghazi developments whistleblowers saying i've been punished for
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:48.360]  speaking out monsanto's got a plan to get rid of gmo labeling worldwide and we're going to be
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:53.720]  getting into that also a story i saw yesterday that really made me upset we've got it linked up on
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:09:00.520]  info wars dot com out of the washington post and it's something i've been aware of for a very long
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.040]  time then i'm going back to your phone calls but i need to get to this at the bottom of the hour
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.560]  and it's a long investigative report
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:16.440]  on how in the state of maryland in the counties they actuary it out and i discovered this myself
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:22.600]  in travis county and it literally is one reason i have so much rage and i'm so hateful if you
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:28.120]  watch early videos when i first got on access tv i was very gentlemanly friendly sound like a country
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:35.240]  bumpkin uh never really got mad or upset and then over the years i turned into what i am now
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:40.680]  know watching cps take families kids for no reason and the families literally crawling around on the
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:48.040]  ground in in in pain and horror uh i discovered and we did pieces on this i know mike hanson's
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.680]  got him he's digging through and we've been trying to get him up online
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:56.760]  we discovered that they would mainly do it to old people and they somehow had a database
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:02.360]  through the health department and this is on record where where when old people went in to get
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:10.920]  it uh colon cancer surgery or lung cancer surgery whatever the case was they would suddenly put
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:20.360]  them into the county's process of taking their property for unpaid property taxes and we would
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:26.520]  go discover they were even paid up and then they had realtors and people that would actually death
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:33.080]  threat us with the police in special units that were involved stealing the property when we would
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:39.480]  try to go defend them and i mean we have a bunch of these reports and then i really discovered
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:44.280]  it when they tried it with my grandparents okay right after my grandfather had a heart attack
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:48.200]  and got back from the hospital then they started up the property tax stuff and my grandmother's
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:53.080]  like but it's paid and can you help me son and and then i found and i had all these hundreds of
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:11:00.440]  old people calling me just in Austin alone because i would cover this and now it's all admitted how
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:06.600]  they would take people's houses for as little as 44 dollars unpaid but the big issue is they
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:16.520]  discovered especially in Baltimore that the people had actually paid and they were taking them
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.400]  and that it was old people they were praying on old people and let me tell you something folks
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.640]  when christ talks about suffer the little children it'd be better for you to tie a giant
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:31.960]  boulder around your neck and throw yourself into the ocean than to hurt one of these
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:39.480]  because vengeance is mine i will come after you that's as i learn more and more that's how the
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:47.160]  whole new world order operates and that what i thought was only going on in austin is going on
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:52.040]  all over the country can you imagine and it turns out it's the city and county people
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.760]  who go and buy the houses themselves that's why they won't announce the auctions we discovered too
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:01.880]  and you'll show up in its county employees at the little auction that they won't even publish
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:05.880]  in a newspaper like they're supposed to do and it turns out like these county people some of them
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:11.560]  are worth here in austin tens of millions of dollars and own 20 30 40 houses because they steal them
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:18.760]  and they all need to be executed in my view i mean let me tell you something you take old
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:25.080]  and it gets into it in the wash in post but white washes it like the feds are doing something
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.600]  about it they're probably only doing something about it because the locals are getting a little
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:34.120]  too greedy and it's getting a little get a little obvious but can you imagine taking
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:39.720]  somebody's house for $44 or they've actually paid the unconstitutional property tax the
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:47.480]  surf tax and you still take their property and i'll tell you why i don't like people calling
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.960]  in and thanking me and saying i'm a great guy at a subconscious level then i'm going to your calls
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.760]  i feel like i'm not articulate enough i'm not doing enough for these people and then i get very
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:04.280]  hateful towards the general selfish narcissistic public that are only into themselves or what their
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:09.800]  skin looks like or you know do they have the fanciest car not that any of that's bad to have a fancy car
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:15.720]  wherever but they worship that meanwhile there are innocent people being abused foster children old
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.960]  people what you want to know how evil the system is look at what they do to the week
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.200]  and then you see government always claiming they care about the children that's why they want to
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:31.800]  attack syria and then they're behind the nerve gassing clearly and then the worst part is the
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:38.040]  psychopaths that are doing all the abuse and their sociopathic camp followers and their
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:43.320]  narcissistic camp followers will do anything for what they perceive as success because they're so
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:49.800]  deeply unfulfilled and insecure they just go around like a scourge abusing everyone
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.360]  and no one can stop them in fact i learned the main reason i got thrown off local radio when i
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:58.760]  had the number one show in the time slot of course got back on local radio soon after on another
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:05.000]  station was because the city got real upset and actually started threatening the general manager
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:12.440]  because i was having people on every week and stopping groups of predator realtors and and
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:17.160]  groups of police that worked with them by the way we found out about this because austin police
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:25.880]  good cops told me about it in 1997 actually brought envelopes up to the station they said yeah
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:30.360]  a cop was just here in plain clothes he wants you to have this envelope and i'm like go look
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.800]  at this old guy having his house taken um uh this city council members involved with this realtor
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.680]  and i didn't know what this was and i learned the cops told me about it because they had special
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:47.480]  cops who were involved who would be involved with the constables and others in harassing these
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:51.880]  people and i mean they would take you know say a half million dollar house that some old world war
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:58.600]  two vet built himself in 1947 i mean that's a real case i just mentioned rolling delingston
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:04.360]  and stuff like that i mean it makes me want to throw up and i said i'd go to your calls it's
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:13.960]  just that i i know all this is going on okay and i just get enraged that people aren't doing anything
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:22.440]  about this okay and if anybody needs to be in prison it's the type of people doing this
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:28.520]  and and that's why the tax system is so evil any big tax system will always get taken over
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:34.520]  by criminals and will be used to rob folks they do it it's it's not a robbing banks folks they rob
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:40.840]  old people and the health department creates and opens a case on any group of old people
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:46.760]  that they believe can't take care of themselves that is a message that then goes out they send out
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:52.040]  a realtor who looks at the property and then they start a move with elder care and stuff
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.920]  to have them thrown in a nursing home then they'll put in fake paperwork thinking the family isn't
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:04.920]  going to pay attention and then they get the house now i feel like turning this desk over right now
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:11.160]  folks and maybe something's wrong with me that i feel very violent when i have flashbacks to this
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:16.680]  stuff okay i mean i literally have flashbacks i'm gonna be honest with people to cps grabbing
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:21.880]  people's kids in front of me and uh seeing old people crying as their house is taken
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:26.360]  and the fact that no one's going to help them you understand that no one's gonna help the
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:31.720]  syrian christians no one's gonna help anybody but us it's up to us to get angry and do something
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:38.440]  about this and i'm sick of it i'm sick and tired of it i'm sick and tired of gangs and bullies and
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:44.520]  government and corporations teaming up to hurt good people and it's because america became gullible
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:51.160]  and trusting that we've gotten in this position america became gullible and trusting and oh our
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.760]  government's good remember the old timer said don't trust the government the old timer said don't
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:59.640]  take help from the government the old timer said do you stay off my land because they knew folks they
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:05.080]  had common sense that's why this country was freer and it's time we start acting like that again
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:10.600]  it's time we start standing up for our families and standing up for each other instead of getting
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:15.400]  off on you know cozying up to these government bureaucrats who are enemies there are a bunch
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.200]  of criminals folks i'm telling you right now let's go to your calls drew roland alex chris
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.280]  we're taking calls for media on their take on the paradigm shift that's happened or do you
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:29.000]  disagree with me on that drew in south carolina talk show host drew give us your take on this
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.760]  thanks for calling in hey alex uh i gotta say um the mood down here in charleston the little tense
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:39.960]  right now um the local media is not covering any of uh lindsey graham's comments it's all coming out
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:45.080]  of uh u.s news and world report now in the cbs local and charlotte but none of the local charleston
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:49.080]  stations are covering any of his comments oh yeah no no i got people telling me that lindsey
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:56.440]  graham didn't say that that's how shut down the story is and there's a lot of police patrols in
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.680]  areas where they're not usually i'm noticing now so it's a very tense mood down here um
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.560]  definitely a big shift uh i think the biggest awakening now is people are finally getting
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.480]  through the realization of that the government doesn't have their best interest in mind for so
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.920]  long as well how can they hurt us they actually care about now people are saying that they are
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:21.720]  equal i think that's what's waking a lot of people up no i agree with you uh what what are the mood
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:26.680]  of the callers that call into your radio show what are they saying um um it's a little tense
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.920]  uh a lot of people are just having uh issues wrapping their head around that the government
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.040]  is behind all this so they are doing it they're starting to come around to it they're starting
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.080]  to see that they can't trust the government i think that's the biggest awakening we're seeing
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.880]  with people is that once that cloud gets lifted and they say okay now i can't trust it yeah i can
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.400]  see how they can do this i see that they're coming at me and that you know they really do
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.960]  understand that it's what we're up against you know that's what's interesting historically is
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:54.600]  that generally things happen incrementally and then suddenly the bottom falls out and suddenly
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:19:00.120]  everybody goes wow how did i not see that before like the allegory of the sunglasses and they live
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:05.480]  what do you think the power structure is going to do now that that that there's a mass awakening
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.440]  happening honestly i'm scared because they're like a caged animal you're backing them into a corner i
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.280]  think we're entering the most dangerous days because they're going to be backing up against the wall
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:19.240]  they're going to have to go for broke they they see their plans falling apart in front of their eyes
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:24.760]  and i think you're gonna go for that hill mary i agree with you and the police and military better
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.360]  decide whose side they're on and i'll tell you from what i've seen they've decided they're on
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.760]  their own side the american people side common sense's side the problem is the globalists have

[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.760]  i want to get again if you just joined us media people's take on what they see happening do you
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:47.720]  agree with me that we're seeing a major sea change and if so how do you think the establishment's
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:55.160]  going to respond actually yes i do now i've been awake since i was in the special forces back in
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:02.680]  the mid 80s i've seen so much of what we were polling that it was an eye opener then later
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:09.560]  becoming a journalist i realized you can't work as a journalist for anyone other than yourself
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:16.200]  you want to tell the truth because the mainstream media doesn't want it and it's funny due to the
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:23.000]  fact that here nobody seems to remember history i don't know if you've ever heard of this allegory
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:34.280]  when julia caesar had his triumphant during after he entered rome he had a slave repeat in his ear
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:40.920]  two things one remember you are but a man you're not a god and the second thing was if you fail
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:47.800]  to learn from history you're condemned to repeat it and right now our country's repeating history
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:53.320]  that's right that's right julia caesar would have his his aid behind him repeat that to him over
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:58.840]  and over again so that he wouldn't become hubris filled because that would blind him politically
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.640]  and he still ended up getting killed and and this elite literally thinks they're invincible
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:10.760]  and is leading us towards thermal nuclear war oh exactly well you this is when i was listening
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:20.680]  to the idiot box um back two months ago excuse me here our politicians were stating unequivocally
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:27.320]  oh well our country happens to go ahead and we don't hurt men women and children we never hurt
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:34.360]  the innocent and it's taking me because i'm native american and i keep thinking back well let's see i
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:42.760]  can list line item by line item of how many tribes you wiped out all in the name of your conquest
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:48.280]  well the next the issue is that it's so cynical when they get up there and go we care about the
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:53.240]  children in syria when madeline albright was asked half a million iraqi kids have died
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:57.720]  under the sanctions is that a good thing and should have continued and she said yeah it's
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:03.080]  a good thing that's on record you know the uh esquire writer didn't believe me when i said
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:08.200]  that he went and pulled the clip up and couldn't believe it i mean these globalist think of all
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:15.160]  of us is dog meat they don't even care about their own children in many cases they are sociopaths
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:21.880]  and psychopaths and we're all in great peril good to hear from you uh ronald uh let's go ahead and
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.440]  talk to alex in illinois writer and blogger what's your take from somebody in the media
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:32.680]  your perspective on where things are going hey buddy uh i have traveled through the rabbit hole
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:37.240]  and punched through the bottom of oblivion through death hell in heaven and to come back
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:43.240]  and say but where the devil disguises the new world order one percenters have become lazy
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:49.800]  decadent and overly sinful and it is now time for them to pay pay for the damages they have made
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:59.320]  to our humanity's planet avenge the swiss cheese gas exploded children we must put a mirror in front
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:07.800]  of them so they can see the monstrosity that they are well i agree with that statement and the
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:12.200]  decadent always look at you and go oh you just don't want us to have fun or they laugh at those of
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:18.680]  us that are criticizing uh what they're involved in if people think of decadence as sex or eating
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:25.320]  too much real decadence is not caring about your neighbors not having empathy not caring about innocent
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:31.640]  animals uh you know just basic things like that not caring about your neighbor they don't understand
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.600]  that when no one cares everything goes to hell in a handbasket and then the predators end up
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:46.040]  ruling we need good people to come together uh in societies of freedom humans always get in gangs
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:52.200]  we need gangs that are into art and literature and freedom and into individualism and into women
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:58.440]  being powerful and men being powerful and celebrating maleness and celebrating femininity
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:04.520]  and celebrating the family instead the corporates want you to celebrate their plastic fake culture
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:11.160]  of death alex god bless you anything else you'd like to add yeah um that new yorker told you
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.880]  some uh advice regarding meditation and i've seen that you've kind of been on edge and kind of
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:22.600]  scrambled by all this chaos uh i've got his name because he's a new yorker you always have him on
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:31.400]  he was on just last week selente yes selente he recommended you doing meditation i'd highly
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:35.800]  recommend that you'd at least 10 minutes a day of meditation no i agree i agree i've got the most
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:40.680]  stressful job probably out there because i can't turn off caring i'm not saying that like i'm some
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:47.240]  goody to shoot i mean i cannot turn off everything affecting me i'm the opposite of a psychopath ladies
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:54.280]  and gentlemen and i don't know you are as well we're on the march the empires on the run alex

[01:33:48.120 --> 01:34:03.880]  all right here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna break down
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:12.200]  what i have researched and what the globalists admit so often i say i have discovered it's
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.760]  like i drove to the east coast and discovered the atlantic ocean for the first time it's not
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:22.200]  like i discovered it i'm saying here's the great truth that is there for everybody and you can
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.280]  disagree with me if you want but i know you're not going to when you hear me talk about this
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:33.720]  because you have experienced it but those of us that are not completely narcissistic are blind
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.880]  to this to a great extent so i'm gonna explain what the psychopaths are doing what they're
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:44.520]  scientifically programming and how we can hopefully reach out and wake people up and then i'm gonna
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:49.240]  go back to chris and bruce and steve and dan and charlie everybody that's holding and then into the
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:55.240]  next hour i want to hear from military about the syrian strike situation and now obama's saying
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:59.880]  well a red line's rhetorical first he said it's a set red line that's the end of it then he said
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:05.480]  a year later last week i never said there was a red line and then they went well we meant it was
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:10.600]  a rhetorical red line and uh and there's absolute prophesied did it but it doesn't matter who did
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:15.320]  it remember he said that in his first speech three weeks ago carry and then now they're going oh looks
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:19.480]  like the rebels might have done it but that's why we got to go in because the rebels have the chemicals
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:25.080]  al qaeda's there we have to go in because of them is a new spin i'm hearing when our government put
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:32.600]  them in charge it'd be like if i sent in bank robbers to rob a bank in there loading a truck
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.560]  full of all the cash and the cops pull up and i go officers you need to arrest these men immediately
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:46.920]  for robbing the bank i will take the cash and protect it oh man i mean it's so ridiculous and
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.480]  i think that's what's happened they're waging war against reality because if they can overthrow
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.120]  reality if they can get us into that kind of trance like state fully they can do anything
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:02.600]  they the establishment is collectively mad doesn't mean they're not functioning at a high
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:09.400]  level and able to run things as obsessive compulsives in many cases a bunch of narcissistic obsessive
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:16.760]  compulsive psychopaths what a what was the term the other day i heard was talking to somebody on
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:27.800]  the phone who was that they called it uh diabolical narcissism and i think that's the term diabolical
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:39.560]  narcissism amazing but before i uh get back to your calls and all of that news and get into some
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:45.960]  of the economy i don't want to get diverted off like i did earlier to reading a big investigative
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:53.240]  report out of the washington post 15 page investigative report only part one about how old
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:37:00.680]  people are targeted by the establishment all over the state of maryland having their homes taken
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:05.720]  when they've actually paid the property tax then there's the whole fraud of the property tax itself
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:15.960]  and then the fact that i literally had flashbacks bad memories of the trenches uh back when
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:24.680]  i would mainly cover local news and and and go and discover all this and have old ladies you
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:31.320]  know crying in their kitchen thanking me for trying to help them and then even go into court
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:37.560]  and stuff and and and and and then watching the criminals try to cover up and wanting to punch
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:42.760]  him in the face in the in the hallway and not being able to because you know the normal things
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.680]  about ripping off an old lady or something i mean you want to you want to attack them i mean
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:52.920]  that's a normal that's a normal behavior of somebody to want to defend innocence but not
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:58.680]  being able to is i think is what turned me into this kind of violent person on air like i attack
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:06.200]  people with my voice and with rhetoric that's based on truth because i hate them and the only
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:13.880]  sucker i get suker the only aiding and abetting the only comfort i get not sucker suker that's
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:23.880]  both the definition of that for me thanks the only reprieve i get from the pain of having empathy
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:32.200]  is to attack the enemy so that's why i act like this and i apologize for acting like that sometimes
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:38.200]  and again sometimes i tend to start talking about myself because it's all a process of being on air
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.760]  and dealing with this and being people ask how do i handle this how do i how do i deal with this
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:47.480]  and now i realize i haven't really handled it i haven't really dealt with it how do i not become a
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:39:02.200]  brutish goblin like gorilla fighting these people now shifting gears to a really big subject and the
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:08.200]  best way for me to break this down is anecdotal give you an example of what i've been through
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:15.160]  working in media i got into media because i didn't want to have my guns taken i got into
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:21.400]  journalism because i wanted to expose globalism i got into the media because that's how you fight
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:28.040]  tyranny but most people that you run into most people i'd say 60 or more that get into media
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:33.560]  it's because they feel unfulfilled and unconfident and they feel like that if they could get on a
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:40.440]  big platform in status that they would be fulfilled and successful some get into it for purely
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:45.400]  mercenary reasons i believe they can make a bunch of money out of and those are the types that actually
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:52.600]  really soar up the ranks of news but when you get an entertainment it is a bunch of addled
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:40:00.280]  narcissists and so then they push the culture of dumb down narcissism and you know basketball
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:05.640]  players going and visiting north korea as kim jong-un mose down the symphony orchestra because
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:11.800]  his wife is jealous of him or whatever it's all about these narcissists and their their power trips
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.080]  but living in austin texas
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:23.800]  that's already had a big entertainment industry ever since i've lived here since high school
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:31.080]  in the early 1990s and and and being able to experience some of that and being involved in
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:35.480]  that i learned that the grass is not greener on the other side celebrities are normal people
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:40.280]  just like everybody else all that really matters is art and things that are interesting not just
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:48.120]  because somebody's famous that means nothing and so i really got a a inside view and radio tv
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:55.080]  print hollywood all of it in the last 18 years to understand it and understand how celebrities
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:01.400]  are literally worshiped as gods and on average the successful ones that you see out front are
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:06.760]  actually put there because they re magnify the narcissism that edward bernay's 80-something
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:13.000]  years ago wrote about saying we should change the subject from issues to nothing but the pageantry
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  of the of the narcissism so that everybody gets obsessed with looking at their own reflection in
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.920]  the water instead of looking at the real world going on around them so the whole world's been
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:32.520]  built to distract you from reality so you're not a real player in the real world it's psychological
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:38.040]  sabotage and i mean trying to get into this it could take hours but i'll just briefly get into
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:43.560]  it and then maybe later even make a film about narcissism i think because when you're young
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:47.640]  you need to be a little bit narcissistic so you develop your image and go out and find a mate
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:53.400]  and you know have some drive but as you become more successful in the hierarchy of needs healthy
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:58.280]  psychology you care about your children you care about the culture you care about the future
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:02.360]  you understand you're not going to live forever you're part of something bigger that's normal
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:06.920]  development so you're supposed to act like a narcissist at 13 years old not at 35
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:14.600]  and you're not supposed to take yourself so serious you know as you get older
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:20.120]  now that's the normal hierarchy of needs but if they can arrest your development
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:25.080]  at about a 12 or 13 year old level where you're trying to be accepted in high school
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:29.560]  as a freshman if they can freeze you there they can then control the messages and the
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:35.400]  media and the establishment can be the cool kids and you'll do anything to feel like you've been
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:43.800]  accepted by them not knowing that the real controllers of all this we hardly even know
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:48.760]  their names they're never on television they're completely secretive surrounded by art and
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:54.360]  literature and science but only to use that to control people the real power structure is the
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:43:00.760]  opposite of a narcissist they're more like a control freak but they use narcissism as the
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:07.800]  as the cultural poison and now that my beloved austin texas you know my mom grew up and my grandparents
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:14.680]  are from as as los angeles and i have the article right here as los angeles collapses
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:21.000]  as the propaganda factory the narcissist command base collapses and the la mayor declared state
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:27.800]  of emergency as movie tv production fleece hollywood as it collapses you've got millions of vampires
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:33.880]  who you know moved out there when they were kids for music for film for whatever that that will
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:41.560]  do anything they think that they won't survive they won't live unless they can be a hollywood star
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:46.520]  or rock star or rap star or whatever the case is and and all and they don't do it for the art they
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:52.520]  only do it because they think they're going to die they need the oxygen they feel so empty because
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:58.600]  they are so close to hollywood that's so empty so they think if they just get closer to it they'll
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:04.840]  be fulfilled when the more they get closer to the fame the more empty they're going to be the more
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:11.960]  imprisoned the more surrounded when i'm flying into los angeles folks literally only place in the
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:16.200]  world this happens i feel physically sick and freaked out and want to get out of there in fact
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:21.640]  in fact basically no one can get me to come there now i've been there in years and have
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:27.800]  it all sorts of amazing offers you know i will not go there i will not get anywhere near because
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:32.840]  i'm telling you spiritually folks i can feel it because everybody's had their souls sucked out
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.520]  there and let me tell you what's happened i may have to leave austin i'm making this announcement
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:42.360]  now it'll be a big deal it'll be a few years i don't know how we're going to do it they're all
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:50.280]  moving here not californians all the nice californians they're the la people that have all failed
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:59.880]  are all racing here and setting up shop all around them this is a microcosm of how the
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:06.120]  new world order in washington dc works as well they're all moving here
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.840]  as the next big gold rush of where they can finally make it and there's con artists
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:19.640]  set up everywhere that you'll pay money to so you can maybe talk to a band about being a part of
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:26.280]  their operation or uh all these people delusion only who know someone that knows someone who makes
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:31.080]  movies and and and and it's all just mass mental illness i know
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:39.080]  dozens and dozens of people just the last five years who've gone completely bonkers believing
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:43.400]  when they couldn't become movie stars or rock stars that they were movie stars or rock stars
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:48.440]  and literally become artificial schizophrenics i don't know what you call it because they weren't
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:54.920]  schizophrenic before they weren't crazy before they actually go insane believing that they finally made
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:46:01.640]  it or they'll give everything they've got to con artists that are telling them that they're gonna
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:07.240]  be stars and that's what obama did when they made him a movie star when you bought into obama
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:11.640]  and you bought into his cult well then you became a winner i know a lot of this is elementary
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:16.040]  people are like yeah tell us the big revelation we know this well get to understand how strong it is
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:26.360]  though and how horrible it is to watch the spiders that set themselves up to use and abuse i have to
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:31.240]  tell crew when we hire them here listen you're gonna have all these offers for media stuff none of
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:36.520]  what's gonna be real they're just gonna offer you stuff to go work for them for free and then
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:42.760]  cheat you that's how la works and that's how austin works now and people have gone before and left to
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:46.520]  go do deals and then of course they call me back a month ago it was all a con job can have my job
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:56.840]  back and i go no you're not gonna stop you can't help it and that's all la does is endless meetings
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:01.080]  and people trying to get angles and it's like vampires looking for people to suck dry but there's
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:07.960]  nobody left so now i'm dubbing it the vampire invasion austin texas is overrun with vampires
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:14.760]  thank god they're only segregated to the trendy areas and they're all trying to feed on each other
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:22.040]  here and i mean it's overrun ladies and gentlemen with delusional emperor emperors new clothes in
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:28.280]  fact let me show you some of the articles right here emperors new clothes is written by hans
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:34.120]  christian anderson the guy that wrote my little mermaid a little mermaid about two weavers who
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:41.240]  promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those unfit for their positions
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:46.280]  stupid or incompetent when the emperor parades before his subjects of the new clothes no one
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.640]  wants to admit they're stupid or ignorant when he's completely butt naked finally a small child says
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:57.000]  but he isn't wearing anything at all and that's the tipping point ladies and gentlemen and now
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:03.640]  understanding mass narcissism artificial mass mental illness where people don't understand
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:07.960]  being honorable is how you succeed in life or being an artist and loving your work is how you
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:13.400]  succeed or being a good person is how you succeed or you know just raising healthy happy children
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:18.280]  is how you succeed or or being truthful and having integrity is how you succeed no they think you
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:24.360]  only succeed and then they worship you but also hate you at the same time because you've been on
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:29.720]  national television or you've had a successful this or that and they think by being around you
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:34.040]  they're suddenly going to become successful just because like some magic rubs off on them
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:39.000]  but all it does is attract vampires that can't get to you they can get to them and then they
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:45.880]  tear them away from you off to be torn to shreds politically and that's what the mainstream media
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:54.920]  is and the whole culture is you buy into this big lie and folks i've had distant family and i've
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:01.160]  had another guy we worked with more than 10 years ago that i heard on air saying i've been offered by
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:07.080]  the ambassador from nigeria to be given 14 million dollars if i only send him 10 thousand dollars and
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:12.520]  i called the person and i said you know that's a fraud and the person said no you're just jealous
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.680]  that the ambassador didn't contact you and i said man this is a known fraud for like five six years
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:22.280]  that time it's like 17 18 years now and i said i will assure you it is a known fraud and the guy
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:28.520]  went on air and said that i was jealous of him getting the 14 million dollars because he never
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:33.880]  got it and then he was even more mad when he ended up getting ripped off it didn't get it folks i know
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:40.120]  people where i tell them i go this is a con this isn't real i mean people come to me and they say
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:45.640]  my daughter has been sent something in the mail it's only a thousand dollars to get placed in a
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:52.120]  thing for models and then it's five thousand dollars once that comes in and they go will you
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:59.000]  help me with the money and these are nice people and i'm saying listen hun this is a fraud
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:04.520]  and i said just to teach you here's one thousand dollars to enter it but when they come back wanting
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:09.880]  five thousand i did this actually you're gonna know it's not real and of course that happened
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.440]  because see they wouldn't believe me if i just said no and then see what happens is
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:20.040]  this once you're sucked into the fraud you don't ever want to admit you've been sucked into it
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  and folks i deal with this now on a weekly basis with people that are delusional
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:32.360]  oh and when people think you're successful the con artists that come out of the woodwork
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:39.080]  going after my wife my family my dad i mean it is because that's their economy they've got to rip
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:44.760]  somebody off or con something instead of building something and see that's when cultures fall that's
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:50.520]  when they collapse so it's like the nigerian email scams it's it's like the emperors new clothes it's
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:55.080]  it's all these vanity fair things they set up where they tell people oh you'll get to be in a

[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:27.800]  live music capital of the world what it is is the music con artist capital of the world
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:33.160]  you've probably got let's not exaggerate a hundred thousand musicians out of a million people living
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:39.240]  here and there are all these groups that feed on them that produce their records that produce their
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:44.040]  albums that take their glamour shots for five ten times what it's worth there's all these lawyers
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:48.840]  that prey on them that are going to get them the big record deal and all it is is a predatory group
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:53.800]  feeding on them here's another example you'll have some guy you know out of college with a bunch of
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.800]  debt same thing as his girlfriend they're going to get married and the women's magazines and
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:00.760]  everything say you got to have a two hundred thousand dollar wedding you got to have all
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:05.240]  these photographers that are super expensive you've got to have this five thousand dollar you know
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:10.520]  cake you've got to or or he doesn't love you and you've got to have a ring that is basically a year's
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:16.680]  salary and then literally it's a semi precious diamond diamonds aren't even precious folks
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.720]  they're semi precious but they're geographically located so they can control them as a monopoly
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:27.240]  and it's all a giant fraud and so the economy becomes this huge fraud and everyone's running
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:35.480]  after the tokens of success so that they can feel like they're more powerful than those beneath them
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:43.320]  and then your culture becomes dead and becomes plastic and becomes stagnant and my problem is
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:50.760]  is that I don't in literature in psychology and in history I know cultures can go mad
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:55.720]  but I'm trying to understand what do you call it where people artificially
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:03.080]  were not mentally ill genetically or to begin with or chemically but they artificially under
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:10.200]  peer pressure I guess it's a mob narcissism almost like mass Stockholm syndrome a term I've coined
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:20.360]  it's like a mob mob narcissism mob delusional mob psychology it is mob psychology
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:31.000]  mass mob effect in some type of bizarre manifestation where the system is completely
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.280]  wearing no clothes and then we just buy into it well it's time to not buy into it and then those
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.680]  of us that do wake up from it and don't want to be part of it we're the bad people and then you
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:46.520]  wonder why the glazed eyed public laughs at you when you're awake and informed and it makes you
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:56.600]  feel bad they're laughing because they're insecure they're they're laughing at you as just a confidence
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:02.520]  act of if they act like they're in charge and they're in control everything's going to be all right
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:11.720]  that's what's going on and and they're dangerous and they will buy into anything as long as it's
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:18.840]  the new fad and the system can produce whatever fad at once so it is the pied piper leading the
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:26.680]  children away and what freaks me out the worst about all this is and I'm going to come back
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:31.320]  with the next hour and go right to your calls those that are holding what freaks me out really
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:38.360]  really bad is that even when they've been conned and and they know they're being conned they won't
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:43.400]  admit it to themselves because they won't admit they've been taken so like a gambler at vegas who
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:47.400]  gets deeper and deeper into debt they start mortgaging their house and going to the pawn shop
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:52.040]  and selling their watch and their kids college fund to come back because they're gonna make it
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:54.760]  they're gonna get themselves out of this hole
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:58:03.480]  and it's so sad to then watch the psychopaths and social engineers taking over the world
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:08.360]  by by by manipulating the public that they've artificially engineered to be narcissistic
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:13.320]  it is absolutely insane and that's why it's more important than ever that everybody out there

[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:40.600]  they'll just get rid of the chemical weapons as a deterrent like they did in iraq in 1991 and

[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:14.360]  and they're bringing george bush to denver tonight so they can parade around du is sponsoring
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:20.360]  the improving human condition award going to george bush it's double speak it's in denver
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:26.760]  i didn't know if you guys had heard about that i think that we need to call for obama to come
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:32.600]  arrest bush instead of going into syria and worrying about the chemical weapons attack i think we
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:37.640]  should talk about the du the plated geranium uh rounds that that bush is okay that our troops
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:41.880]  use and our troops are still dying from it today and they're still suffering and so i think that's
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:45.560]  highly important and i i wanted to call and just let you know that we are changed colorado's going
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:50.680]  to be out there in full force tonight and that's going to be a you know i did see that about a
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:55.240]  month ago they announced he was getting the award and i guess he's he's going to receive it now
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:02:00.200]  for improving humanity award i think i think we should give obama one as well and while they're
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:05.880]  at it they could dig up uh you know maybe joe stalin and give him an award how's that sound
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:12.440]  yep yeah all the dictators now this is just a slap in the face of du two-thirds of uh staff
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.720]  signed a letter saying we don't want george here in our name at our university the denver
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:23.160]  university uh most of the students don't approve today's the first day of class coming back and

[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:32.360]  in the colorado area should come out and uh and see this one it's going to be a spectacle we're
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:36.600]  working with a lot of different activist groups here in denver to uh just get the numbers up and
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:42.280]  just show that we're not okay with george w bush uh coming to denver and winning it now they had to
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:47.880]  change it from improving human condition to the uh what is it global humanity award because there
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:52.360]  was so much public pressure but uh i just figured that as a as a little side note to the war on
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:57.720]  syria we have war criminals known war criminals and they're coming to denver and they're parading
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:02.760]  around for a four hundred dollar uh a plate fundraiser it's kind of a slap absolutely i

[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:40.200]  you know talk radio network probably the second the third largest radio syndicator went dark last
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:51.240]  week off the air clear channel is bankrupt but the big banks the big brokerage firms that helped
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:55.160]  consolidate the radio industry the last 15 years they've already moved on from that
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:03.560]  and i tell you it's pretty creepy to see talk radio uh imploding and melting down all over the
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:09.240]  united states something that top management of the globalist has been pushing for i know a lot of
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:16.120]  inside baseball but i'm not allowed to tell but people better appreciate the talk radio that they do
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:23.960]  here in fact it was what about six months ago we got the word that there were moves to shut off
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:31.080]  basically all libertarian and conservative talk on xm but because it's been so popular uh there's
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:35.560]  been internal fights with their program directors and people not to do that but i'm telling you
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:42.280]  ladies and gentlemen genesis the gcm radio network with over 1400 affiliates one way or another
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:47.640]  i've got over 160 of them is pretty much all there's left that's someone independent
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:57.480]  there's clear channel on the verge of imploding and it's got a lot of great people on it like
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:03.800]  well i'm not even going to get into it anymore the point is is that uh i was just thinking about
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:10.840]  that during the break i haven't even talked about that it is such a crazy world and again it was a
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:19.080]  bubble how much stations cost by some of the big boys coming in the last 20 years 15 years really
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:23.960]  and and and buying stations for more than they were worth and consolidating them and creating
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:30.200]  monopolies and running stations at losses to bankrupt the other local stations to create
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:36.920]  monopolies now the stations cost so much to run with the government fees and licensing and and
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:44.440]  the economy in the toilet with advertising and then the cost again of just to buy the stations
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:49.960]  and then to finance the debt on the stations that it is going to be a completely different
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:11:01.080]  landscape in just another year and i will continue to be here because we're not owned by some foreign
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:07.080]  banking cartel we're just here our mission is to get the word out and fight the globalist our
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:13.320]  mission is try to avert world war three our mission is to defend bill of rights and constitution not
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:23.400]  not join all the kleptocrats in just some mad race to make a buck as quick as you can and then
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:31.400]  watch the whole world burn by the way i'm going back to your calls but speaking of syria russia
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:38.520]  to push syria to surrender chemical weapons and syria welcomes international control over chemical
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:47.320]  weapons by the way this is being called new news syria offered a year ago and again a few months
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:51.880]  ago to turn their chemical weapons over and the russians have had troops at the chemical weapons
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:58.840]  bases so all they're doing is announcing what's already been done they saw the frame up coming
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:07.640]  a year ago and brought the russians in but we have guys in fancy suits that get up there and
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:18.600]  tell us oh no didn't you know basher Assad launched that chemical attack now carry who cares about
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:24.440]  the children actually he cares about diverting everyone from all the giant scandals the biggest
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:29.160]  of which is obama care i'm here to announce that i've thought about the nsh i've thought about
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:35.000]  ben gazi gade i've thought about the persecution of the tea parties the persecution of journalists
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.160]  the whistleblowers the list goes on and on but you know why the public's really waking up and
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:46.120]  doesn't buy this war out of all the different reasons and there's a bunch the biggest one
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:55.480]  is that all of these high school college students but also the working poor people getting paid
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:02.360]  seven eight nine ten dollars an hour they all saw their payroll taxes go up they saw the other seven
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:06.520]  taxes that are on obama care they're getting the letters now saying they got to buy healthcare for
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:10.680]  at least five thousand dollars a year that's up to a third of what they're paid a year
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:16.120]  they're going bankrupt two jobs aren't enough
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:23.560]  and they're all being told you don't get 40 hours a week you'll certainly never get overtime again
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:38.200]  you're going to 20 hours i was at martin springs a giant damned up natural spring
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.160]  and i had a lifeguard come over to me and say oh my gosh they just cut everybody from 40 hours to
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:50.680]  20 and they're even cutting the managers back to 20 even though it says 30 they're just cutting us
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:56.120]  down to 20 and they're just hiring more people and i i tried to warn about obama care but and
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:00.200]  then i had another lifeguard come over and tell me about it because they all got the word i was
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.400]  wondering why the last time i was there was all these new lifeguards well that's the new thing
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:10.440]  you get four hours a day do you like your obama care and with that money you get
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:16.520]  that little bit of money you got to go buy healthcare now that that now is run by the
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:21.160]  insurance companies that wrote it where you don't even get the healthcare the doctors aren't allowed
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:24.600]  to do the tests for the or the things they think need to be done and i know everybody
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:31.720]  already knows this in this audience but now to see it happen obama phone lady when she was here
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:41.800]  she saw this year when it kicked in her her taxes went up as a maid obama phone lady works
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:50.840]  and she had a hope her american dream was obama was gonna give her a house a car and when she
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:55.800]  was here this is video that hadn't been seen yet to be an obama deception too she literally had
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:01.000]  tears in her eyes she goes i believe he's gonna give me a house in the car folks what he gave
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.680]  he was a tax increase honey and then that's what makes me so mad about these people is they know
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:12.040]  they're con and people they get off on it i know that con artists looking obama's eyes and carry's eyes
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:18.520]  they're predators they to them it's funny that's why i'll imitate them and laugh at you and laugh
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:23.160]  at us when i talk about this is to show you what they really think it's all a big joke
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:29.800]  but just like people i currently know i go that's a scam that somebody that knows somebody's going
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:34.040]  to give you a job working for a rock man and the people have their bags all packed ready to go meet
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:37.560]  and i go you're going to get a call they're going to need more money that the rock band
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:41.320]  isn't ready to meet with you and then they get the call and they go well that's just because
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:48.600]  they're busy i have to pay them more money now i'm like no no no no no no it's a con game and
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:57.080]  they're like you're just jealous that i finally made it i know people get the nigerian email and
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:01.240]  they go this is a true story i'm with mike judge you know the creator of beavis and butt head
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:06.840]  idiocracy you name it king of the hill we like to go out sometimes and you know go out here he likes

[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:40.760]  out acting all powerful posing what the politicians do and everyone's sort of bowing down basically
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:52.440]  in this mainly a black bar we're in and i watch him go around everyone begging oh
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:56.120]  he'll let you invest if you're cool enough but he's just handing out his card you get to meet
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:00.280]  with him and i was telling people i go you know that's just a physical nigerian scam now on the
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:07.560]  ground no no he's actually a prince and i mean it was like coming to america eddie murphy you
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:13.960]  know like guys are like lying hats on and stuff or whatever and uh i couldn't help anybody including
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:17.800]  the white yuppies that were there i mean by the time judge got there he was good the ambassador
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:22.520]  was gone wasn't the ambassador it was a total con game and i went looked up how there is now a
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:27.720]  physical nigerian scam you just i mean if i you show up in a crown you become the king of england
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:33.480]  i mean you know north korea i expect him to start wearing crowns because in a narcissistic world where
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:41.160]  people worship status you know we're the opposite of that going to some dive bar to hear good blues
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:48.440]  music the point is is that they're even there i can't get away from the narcissistic looney tune land
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:54.680]  that the world has now become and and just the scams are going on every angle and and these
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:59.640]  women i know that demand their their their fiance you're going to have to take out a loan
[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:05.240]  even though the her family's supposed to pay for they're dumb enough to my wife and i even though
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:11.000]  we had some money in the bank and things we got married uh 13 years ago guess how many people
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.760]  were in our wedding about eight people went and stayed at the driscoll had a good dinner
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:22.760]  went got married by a preacher that day that was it went on a vacation later i think everything
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:30.440]  might have cost wouldn't the vacation like six thousand dollars or something because we we were
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:35.480]  we were just married that's our relationship and i only had a few friends there and my parents and
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:42.200]  some of her family and that was it because it was all about not being stressed out and just
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:47.560]  having a good time but let me tell you it most people i know now get divorces within a few
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:51.240]  months after the bigger the wedding i've seen people that have had like 300 thousand dollar
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:54.840]  weddings and especially when they don't have money and they get everybody to go into hawk to pay for
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:19:00.440]  it it's this big narcissistic trip they're divorced a month later they're annulled a month later i mean
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:05.080]  i've i've been made to go to these weddings like i won't go to a big wedding now and i go to them
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:09.960]  and i'll tell my wife about this is going to be over in about a month i'm going to a wedding of
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:15.960]  people worth hundreds of millions of dollars in a couple weeks actually this weekend and guess what
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:22.680]  they're having a small ceremony and a dinner and that's it by the way really rich people don't wear
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:27.080]  diamonds folks they were other really precious stones because they know it's all a big con game
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:36.360]  i mean i sit there and i look at the general public and i see just the the false reality
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:41.000]  they're living in and they really think that they're like making it by buying into it and it's all
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.960]  giant bear traps meant to rip your legs off the messages you see in mainstream media are meant
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:51.480]  to con you and destroy you and they're the same thing as the nigerian email where prince abouby

[02:19:56.200 --> 02:20:03.320]  mad because i the prince wants to meet with me every time you eat a cooked food your body responds
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:07.960]  by producing an increase in circulating white blood cells this happens because nature designed us
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:13.800]  to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level when we eat food to normal cooking temperatures
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:19.160]  we change the shape of the molecules into shapes the body cannot use the body now looks at them as
[02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:24.280]  toxins and allergens in an effort to protect itself from this irritant the body intelligently
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:29.160]  increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as garbage collectors white blood
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:33.480]  cells gobble up all the unusable damaged food particles to neutralize their cell damaging

[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:28.680]  finally accomplished and everything unravels only those who know this secret info will survive and

[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:19.800]  go
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:28.120]  all right folks we're joined by stephan molyneum who is a very very interesting fellow he's been
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:33.640]  on the broadcast before i guess you could almost call him a hyper libertarian or anarchic capitalist
[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:41.640]  and he's also a author of two novels and i'm very excited to get him on the broadcast here today
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:45.880]  this is a short segment long segment coming up and we'll jam your calls in too towards the end
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:50.280]  regardless i know people have been holding for a while so we'll get to you but i wanted to bring
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:56.360]  this up to stephan that's the reason i wanted to get him on if you look at the world today
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:01.800]  now more than ever from my perspective there is a mass awakening i know i keep hammering this because
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:07.160]  it's it's so incredible to see it happening even the new york sun said collapse of american influence
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:12.360]  recalls this integration of soviet union fall of france well this is the fall of the corporate
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:18.120]  globalist that are in control of us and i'm not saying it's happened yet but the the acceleration
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:23.880]  of the awakening the people not buying into it the rapid decline of the dominant mainstream media
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:31.720]  they're no longer dominant uh the the the rise of the new media i wanted to ask stephan molyneum
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:37.480]  who's a pretty smart god almost calling historian where he thinks we are historically and how he
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:42.440]  thinks the empire is going to strike back or if he disagrees with me that a hyper awakening is
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:48.440]  beginning uh stephan thanks for joining us thanks now let's uh alex it's great to be back how you
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:52.760]  doing good so you just heard my little preface there where do you think we are culturally
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:58.040]  worldwide right now do you agree or disagree or what can you add to what i just said well i think
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:03.000]  that we're in a fascinating place historically i would argue that it's really been probably half
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:08.680]  a millennia or so since we've been in such an exciting place for the transition of humankind
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:12.680]  to a higher moral plane you really i think would have to go back to the invention of the printing
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:18.680]  press which took the religious texts and the greek philosophy texts and the roman political texts
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:22.760]  and rhetoric texts out of the hands of the monks and the priesthood and put them in the hands of
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:27.320]  the common people so people could read original texts and they didn't have to learn latin they
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:31.480]  could read in the vernacular as montan luther translated the bible into the vernacular this
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:37.160]  put information into the hands of the people and it had a huge effect on breaking the power of the
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:42.920]  aristocracy of the monopoly of christendom which the catholic church had at the time and it really
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:48.920]  gave people access to information that before they had to go through biased people to get now of course
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:53.880]  we can get information about the world without having to go through the court toadies known as
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:58.520]  the mainstream media we can actually get direct information from who are regularly called our
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:03.000]  enemies who have a very important perspective in conflicts we can get information from people
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.520]  passionate about truth who aren't wedded or bound into the systems of power that currently
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:14.840]  strangled humanity 91 percent of americans don't want another costly war or even cheap war in
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:19.640]  the middle east they're skeptical about escalation in syria they're skeptical about what the government
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:24.840]  says 60 percent say they have little to no trust in the mass media so and it's not like they don't
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:29.640]  want information anymore they're just going to alternative sources which are i think unbiased
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:35.160]  sources we don't rely people like you and i don't rely on government handouts which we read often
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:39.800]  call news to our audience we are responsible for going digging up the truth no matter how painful
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:44.440]  no matter how difficult and presenting it to people and we are not bound to the systems of power
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:50.200]  that gives people a clear unbiased view i think of what is happening in the world and that kind
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:53.800]  of transition hasn't occurred for probably about 500 years and that gave rise to the
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:58.600]  renaissance to the enlightenment to the age of reason the scientific method to capitalism
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:03.480]  i think this and this is going to be even faster and more powerful so i think that we really are
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:08.840]  writing a crest of unbelievable potential for the moral progress of the species incredibly well
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:14.040]  said and i couldn't agree more stephan then let me ask you this question how will the empire strike
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:19.880]  back shouldn't we be girding ourselves for their attempt to bully us back under their control
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:28.920]  well force works really well in controlling a population as long as they don't view it as force
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:35.720]  the moment that the the fist comes out of the glove and people see the naked might and power
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:40.680]  of the state they recoil and they recognize that they're not free you know as long as they can
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:47.000]  camouflage the sort of tax cattle electric fences with bushes and and hang little ornaments on it
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:51.560]  and say oh there's a nice set of bushes over there then then we're fine but so what's happening is
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:56.920]  we are beginning to see the naked power that's behind the curtain and once people see that
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:01.400]  they recoil human beings really can only be kept in cages that they can't see the moment that they
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:05.960]  see them we turn from like domesticated dolphins into great white sharks and we'll chew our way
[02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:10.200]  out of the aquarium no matter what the cost and i think that we're working really to show the gun
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:15.080]  in the room which is state power which is the power of the moneyed interest which is the power of the
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:19.640]  the cabals that that run the world that are sort of behind the media behind even the politicians
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:25.480]  we're starting to see that which is incredible all you have to do is show evil and it will be resisted
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:31.160]  and overthrown as long as evil can present itself as virtue as protection as law and order as
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:36.040]  stability well that lies all falling apart and once we once people see evil for what it is it
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:42.360]  is always overthrown people didn't oppose slavery stefan stay there stefan stay there we gotta get
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:47.400]  this guy on more often it's like a year passie and monomic we're stefan amazing and we're gonna come

[02:33:11.800 --> 02:33:17.960]  stephan malinu it's free domain radio dot com hundreds of millions of people have downloaded
[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:22.440]  his work just on youtube alone and that's got a really upset the globalist here there's not just
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:27.720]  alex jones out there or ron paul or a matt drudge or all the other great people out there that
[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:33.880]  are really promoting the human awakening and fighting the state-run media it's that there's
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:39.320]  so many prominent people that they can't get us all and we live all over the world stephan lives
[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:44.520]  up in canada at least last time i checked and i just wanted to get him on so you could get his
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:51.480]  perspective on history on the way things work on the mind control that the system's engaged in but
[02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:56.760]  what he just said is what i basically said in a different way in the first hour that once humans
[02:33:56.760 --> 02:34:02.840]  awaken to the fact that they're being persecuted manipulated nothing can stop us if we just passively
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:09.960]  resist the system it's over but at the same time i see it almost like triage you've got so many people
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:16.760]  that have been turned into hollywood head narcissists who have been basically programmed to follow
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:23.560]  whatever madison avenue says so i see that really as the biggest revolution waking up to how they
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:29.800]  program these false rights and these distractionary issues away from basic freedoms and so i wanted
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:35.720]  to get your take on that i'm seeing the awakening by what you call thinking people across the left
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:40.760]  right yeah those paradigm shattering people really not trusting the system and actually
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:46.360]  understanding false flag that's now in the vernacular that's now in the common nomenclature
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:52.680]  and it's accelerating but for those that are in the matrix i see them getting even more
[02:34:54.600 --> 02:35:01.000]  mindless more almost like it's stylish to be stupid and to be abused and to be conned
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:07.720]  what do you think is going to happen to those people and can you speak to the points i've made
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:14.600]  and and that add your own points about narcissism being the programming cult system because narcissism
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:20.600]  is like a fake version of individualism because it's programmed by the narcissistic programmers in
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:26.680]  the media versus individualism which they then demonize and claim is some self-centered narcissism
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:32.600]  when it's actually the opposite yeah i mean there's there's a lot in there certainly things like
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:37.640]  sociopathy one of the most dangerous mental states has doubled rates of sociopathy have doubled
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:42.120]  over the last 15 years which is incredibly tragic and of course it's simply creating another crop
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:47.240]  of politicians to wrap their spiny little hands around our throats but i would argue that we are
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:52.200]  distracted of course by materialism i've always loved the the challenges and complexities of the
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:57.320]  english language so the word possession is something you own but it's also a word for a devil that
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:03.000]  inhabits you and and tells you what to do i think that this sort of vanity and narcissism and the
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:08.520]  focus on possessions is the oldest battle of philosophy do we focus on virtue and courage
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:13.720]  and strength and speaking truth to power and fighting for the freedom of all or do we want
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:18.200]  the latest iphone and shiny toys to distract ourselves with and and the elites are always in
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:23.800]  the the the business of giving us better and more shiny toys so that we stay home playing call of duty
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:28.680]  rather than engage in the real fight for the future but i think enough people are are waking
[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:33.240]  up to the urgency and the importance of what's happening you know a lot of people will see a
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:38.600]  system starting to fail through philosophically like on basis on the basis of principles when you
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:42.760]  violate the non-aggression principle when you violate property rights you set yourself up for
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:47.240]  conditions of significant failure you can see this coming as many austrian economists iron
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:52.040]  ran and other thinkers did decades ago but then there are other people who have to kind of hit
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:56.040]  rock bottom you know like some guy can tell you you know cocaine and hooker is not the way to go
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:01.960]  man but until you wake up in a vegas ditch with some underpants on your head naked with an armadillo
[02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:06.120]  attached to you in some horrible way you just don't wake up and so a lot of people now having
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:10.840]  gone through this worst and greatest recession slash depression of the last 60 or 70 years
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:14.680]  are recognizing that the system doesn't work and they're in search of answers and before
[02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:20.440]  they would have been fed the pablum they would have been fed the soma of the general narrative of
[02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:24.680]  well we need more government we need more bailouts we need more force we need more wars we need more
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:28.920]  prisoners we need more police we need more guns we're in the hands of the state and people aren't
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:33.240]  believing that anymore like for instance you don't hear people say well if we only spent more on
[02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:37.800]  public school education they'd get better and we don't hear that anymore the government is out of
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:42.200]  answers because there's no possibility that we could give the government more power than we've
[02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:46.760]  given them already without becoming a complete dictatorship so nobody's really talking about
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:51.320]  more power to the government and people are starting to listen to less violation of property
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:57.800]  rights less initiation of the use of force less debt less fiat slavery less less student debt
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.240]  slavery and they're really starting to be open i think we're at the end of that pendulum and
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:05.720]  starting to swing back but dear lord above it requires some strong souls to push in the right
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:13.080]  direction i agree with you but but i mean take the the extreme end of libertarianism i then see
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:19.720]  peter thiel another big globalist steering uh the discussion where now the establishment has
[02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:25.240]  been tax exempt they've been above the law they've had diplomatic immunity and now they're kind of
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:29.560]  pushing a libertarian idea of where okay now they've stolen everything i'm not even saying he
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:33.720]  particularly stole things but the power structure in a command and control system where they have
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:39.160]  monopolies and oligopolies and combines and they're exempt or partially exempt now they're
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:45.320]  arguing since they've already stolen everything oh yes we do back a privatization we do back a
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:54.440]  consolidation but it's really a evil doppelganger of a true local free market system so so so how do
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:59.960]  you respond to the concerns out there that you've got a lot of really dangerous forces
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:07.160]  that now want to segue into a lower tax smaller government system because they've actually now
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:14.200]  become the centers of gravity themselves in corporate governance well of course if a farmers
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:20.040]  then they've tried this throughout sort of machine farming or factory farming if the if the stalls get
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:24.600]  too small then the cattle start banging their head back and forth and they they get infections and
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:29.080]  they die you can't you can't even use their meat let alone their milk and so what the farmers do
[02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:33.720]  is they widen the stalls and they say well this is a little too confined let's just stretch that out
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:37.560]  a little bit because the cows are beating their own heads to death now that's not they're not about
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:42.520]  to set the cows free for heaven's sakes they're just trying to give a little more freedom because
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:48.920]  they've found that there's too much control too much coercion too much top-down hyper-regulation
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:51.960]  so what they're doing is they're going to take the shackles off the market a little bit they're
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:56.840]  not dumb they know that they've gone too far in the direction of fascism and totalitarianism
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:01.080]  they'll take these shackles a little bit loose maybe you know the end of a free-range chicken is
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.400]  not freedom in the woods it's the chicken mcnugget box and that's exactly where we're headed unless
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:10.280]  we realize that we don't want bigger stalls we don't want a little bit less regulation we don't
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:15.320]  want lower taxation we want to examine the whole question of how human society is is organized
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:22.120]  and say do we necessarily always have to have this group of soulless people with a monopoly on
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:27.080]  violence right at the center of society how small can we shrink this thing and still have something
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:32.840]  that functions and yeah they'll give us a little more freedom but it's only to save their own skin
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:36.600]  and most dangerously I think what they're going to do as they generally do when a financial system
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.520]  begins to fall apart they'll provoke a war and through that war they kill off the dependent
[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:45.160]  classes right the poor the people on welfare this is how they kill off the dependent classes now I
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:49.320]  don't think that there's going to be like a world war three the nucleus have rendered that pretty
[02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:53.240]  much impossible because actually the leaders now pay for war in a way that they didn't use to
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:58.760]  but there will be a huge sacrifice I believe of the dependent classes welfare will be cut
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:04.360]  old age security pensions will be cut and people are going to have a really really rough time of it
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:08.920]  and naturally of course all the people who like the free market will be blamed for this and will
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:13.080]  be told that we don't care about the poor but the only people who care about the poor are those who
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:18.280]  really challenge this dependency culture and this you know fruits of the forced labor of others
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:23.000]  culture that is so yeah there's no doubt there's no doubt the welfare state is designed to create
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.720]  a permanent peasant class and wrecks everybody gets involved and they can point out a few success
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:33.160]  stories but uh they are few and far between and and I want to get into Syria with you and then
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:39.320]  some phone calls but specifically I understand what you're saying and people could say well
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:43.320]  Alex you know you're saying work in the system I say work in the system to make it smaller
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:49.400]  while we work culturally to wake people up to the great truths that individualism is what empowers
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:53.960]  someone it's what makes them I mean a plant that doesn't get rained on or get you know wind blowing
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:59.320]  on it that grows up indoors will usually end up falling over and dying it it needs those stresses
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:06.200]  that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger I understand that I'm saying how do we stop the
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:10.280]  builder bergs and other globalist and people who mainly got their money if you look at them
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:17.160]  from monopolies through government how do we stop them from co-opting the liberty movement and and
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:26.440]  and then only selectively delivering freedom uh in kind of an Elysium type situation well it's
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:31.000]  it's all about the principles you know I think the greatest successful revolutions in history
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:35.080]  have all been based upon principle there was a principle which the founding fathers pursued
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:39.640]  which was as small the government as humanly possible government is a necessary evil at best
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:43.400]  and should be kept as small as humanly possible that was a principled argument they had a whole
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:47.400]  enlightenment series of philosophers behind them making that case for the free market and
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:53.160]  a very tiny government as they said bound down by the chains of the constitution if you look at
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:58.120]  the end of slavery they didn't say well it'll be more economically productive if we don't have
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:04.440]  slavery they said no slavery is an unmitigatable moral evil and they kept pounding the moral
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:08.760]  argument the moral argument the moral argument that's I think it's the biggest slowest and most
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:15.480]  powerful lever that moves the world we have to keep making the case we have a right to our own
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:21.960]  money we have a right to our own trade we have a right to our own property we should not have to
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:25.560]  pay off the government we have a right to our own choices simply to live in the houses that
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:30.600]  we've built with our own hands we have a right to liberty we have a right to freedom of communication
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:36.280]  we have a right to freedom from surveillance and these are fundamental rights and to violate them
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.240]  is a moral evil we have to keep pounding that and once people see that nobody's pro-slavery
[02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:45.960]  anymore and nobody will be pro these kinds of governmental intrusions in the future but we
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:50.200]  have to keep pounding the moral argument it's really slow but I think it's the only thing that
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:53.800]  permanently changes the way people think well you're absolutely right I mean look at how the
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:59.160]  psychopaths and sociopaths that run things always hammer us with dead children we've got to invade
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:03.320]  because of the babies and incubators not true we've got to attack Assad he launched a chemical
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:09.560]  attack turns out it's not true and people are now why is this but they program us using the fact
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:15.000]  that we do have morals we do care so how does the average individual that does have morals that
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.440]  does have empathy individually how do we deal with the collectivists that are so good at punching our
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:26.440]  buttons well I just simply ask how does this rule apply to you whenever somebody in authority
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:31.480]  gives me a rule I say how does this apply to you this got me in trouble even when I was in high
[02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:36.280]  school and they said well you have to pass these tests in order to show us that you know stuff
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:40.280]  and I remember saying to the teacher at the time well which test do you have to pass to prove that
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:44.680]  you're a good teacher you know my parents don't pay you voluntarily I'm not here by choice so
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:48.680]  how on earth how does this rule that you're inflicting on me apply to you I mean do you
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:56.200]  know I'm sure you know this that the senators and congressmen who voted yes to these murderous strikes
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:01.720]  on Syria these potential strikes 83 percent more defense money than the others yeah I mean the
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:07.080]  all of the economic growth that has occurred over the last four or five years have been public
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:12.120]  sector jobs the majority of which are in the military industrial complex war and it's a tragic
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:19.000]  thing to say about a glorious nation which once was central to free trade war is the last prop
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:23.560]  on the sinking ship it's the last little thing that's keeping this this house of cards up called
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:30.040]  the American economy if you stop war if you end war if you stop having 700 bases overseas if you
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:36.360]  stop poking the hornet's nests of crazy groups overseas if you stop spending on war the American
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:40.760]  economy as we know it will simply collapse and nobody wants to be at the helm of that that's why
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:46.280]  they have to keep poking up these crazy conflicts since the early 1960s every three years the American
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:51.000]  government has invaded or bombed some foreign country oh but we're the world's peacemakers
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:55.960]  and policemen and so on my goodness if the police are consistently waging home invasions we can expect
[02:45:55.960 --> 02:46:00.920]  the citizens to be a little suspicious about the serve and protect motto by the way the Washington
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:05.640]  post came out with a big report over the weekend admitting and then there have been indictments
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:09.960]  all over Maryland they target old people they know can't take care of themselves and can't defend
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:16.600]  themselves as predators do you know a sick gazelle the lion goes after it on people that had paid
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:21.880]  the property taxes you know the headline is people had houses taken for 44 unpaid dollars but actually
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:25.880]  some of them they set them up because they wanted their house well i discovered this happening in
[02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:31.720]  austin 16 years ago and people didn't believe me it later came out imagine the predatory evil
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:37.160]  but really as you would say it's only an extension of the feudal tax on your property you don't really
[02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:42.840]  own your property we didn't have a property tax the last 60 70 years in this country it was abolished
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:47.880]  in feudal germany in the 1880s but they brought it back and now germany has german citizens that
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:52.840]  fled here with their children to homeschool being sent back to have the parents put in jail for 20
[02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:59.640]  years and the children taken the truth is that government is a cult of criminals i mean they
[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:05.400]  are absolutely outrageous criminals and here is more proof well in new york if you don't pay your
[02:47:05.400 --> 02:47:10.440]  property taxes the government has very kindly it's very very nice and generous of them alex of course
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:15.480]  they very kindly allowed you to come and work for them for free to pay off your property taxes now
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:20.520]  if that is not serfdom slash slavery if this is not a ghastly little rotting lepros finger of the
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:25.400]  middle ages poking its way through the spacetime continuum into the 21st century what is i mean
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:29.960]  little old ladies are going there to shuffle papers and answer questions on the phone for no pay
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:34.840]  because the government has asserted a claim over their legally owned private property when as men
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:39.480]  we should say they come throw you out of your house but as men we should say how dare you
[02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:44.600]  say an old woman doesn't own her house when it's paid for their tax exempt but but it doesn't matter
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:49.480]  they just do whatever they want and no amount of taxes is ever enough to pay them explain to people
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:54.200]  because you break this down well how we're like these different farms countries are different
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:58.760]  farms and how historically the problem is when you do get a free country with low taxes and
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:04.280]  regulations it becomes so wealthy that even if the tax is tiny it builds a giant government
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:10.280]  parasite and you always end up in the same place yeah this is the great lesson of the last few
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:17.560]  hundred years and again i point to america created philosophically morally as the smallest government
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:23.400]  that the human race had ever seen what an incredible feat to to philosophically create the smallest
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:29.720]  government the world had ever seen and since then it has grown into the very largest the very most
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:34.920]  powerful the most dangerous government the world has ever seen with the most reach in the world with
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:40.040]  the capacity to destroy human life many times over in countless different ways with a prison
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:49.160]  population at the moment in america that is larger than the gulag apicalago under starlin this is
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:53.880]  what came out of the very smallest government and the reason it happens very briefly is that
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:59.000]  a small government allows for free trade free trade creates a division of labor and and and
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.560]  say's law and all of the efficiencies that occur through that and economic growth is
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:08.440]  five six seven eight nine percent per year creates massive wealth enormous wealth unprecedented
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:13.320]  wealth in the in the united states in the 19th century standards of livings went up many times
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:19.080]  and the price of things went down for a hundred years can we imagine this in this current hyper
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:24.200]  inflation cancer based fiat currency nightmare that we live in the prices continually go down
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:29.720]  that everything is like computers and what happens is as the wealth grows the government can take
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:34.360]  more and more of that wealth and people still feel wealthy you know if my if my income has doubled
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:39.560]  over the past 10 years and my taxes have gone up 20 percent i still feel richer and then what the
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:43.560]  government can do this is the most chilling thing that occurs what the government can do
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:49.400]  is it can say based upon your future taxes it can borrow in the here and now as treasury bonds
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:53.560]  and all the national debt they can say well you know what my tax livestock they're going to be
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:57.480]  producing a lot of taxes in the future so it's like a farmer borrowing against his crop product
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:02.840]  and they do that on the birth certificates it's it's debt slaves yeah it's debt slaves and so
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:07.080]  what happens is they sell off the unborn talk about taxation without representation you don't
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:11.320]  even exist yet and you're being taxed and so they sell off the unborn they create this huge
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:15.080]  debts and they use that to bribe people into here and now which maintains their power the biggest
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:21.320]  power of the king is to give gifts and he gives gifts in return for supporting murder or hiding
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:26.920]  murder through stories in the mass media and so you get this situation where freedom breeds tyranny
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:32.680]  it's a terrible cycle that occurs england uh in the in the 17th 18th century was really the country
[02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:37.000]  along with the Netherlands that really invented what is called modern free trade got rid of
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:40.680]  mechanicalism got rid of the guilds of the middle ages allowed free trade and what happened
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:46.600]  they became a giant empire free trade leads to empire and this is the only way to interrupt
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:51.320]  the cycle is to really question the degree to which we can allow any institution to initiate
[02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:55.960]  the use of force in society now that's the problem that's the problem freedom creates incredible

[02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:12.280]  bunch of callers but holding to talk to myself and stephan all the name a little bit of overdrive
[02:54:12.280 --> 02:54:17.560]  with stephan you go to info wars dot com you can see the info wars poll how do you think the conflict
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:23.560]  and Syria will turn out 54 percent said world war three i usually agree with the folks voting
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:29.160]  there but i don't want to agree with that uh but it it it does show that elites generally do expand
[02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:32.760]  wars when they get in trouble and that's the problem of stephan i don't want to hog anymore i
[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:38.360]  want to go to a few calls here but briefly how do you fix it then if liberty brings prosperity
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:42.680]  and then brings a big government i guess you're saying you can't allow any government then
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:48.680]  well again if you're going to have the non initiation of the use of force i would argue that
[02:54:48.680 --> 02:54:53.960]  we should explore the possibility that this can be truly universalized which means i wonder the
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:57.960]  degree to which we can have spontaneous self-organization within society now i know it's not going
[02:54:57.960 --> 02:55:02.520]  to happen tomorrow it's probably a multi-generational change but i think we should certainly explore
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:07.160]  it i don't know any way to interrupt this cycle once you have wealth in a society and a group
[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:12.200]  of people who can use force at will power corrupts and there's no human being who's immune from that
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:16.360]  i mean i'd like to think if you gave me power over the world tomorrow i'd do a good job but
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:20.280]  i'd probably just slide into the same pit of slimy viciousness that that seems to befall
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:24.920]  everyone else who gains power so you know it is uh you know it's a funny kind of ring the only
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:29.000]  thing to do is drop it in the mountain of fire i just don't know any other way that we can we
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:32.440]  can deal with this problem in the long run but again it's it's generations away i think that
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:37.480]  kind of stuff i think one big answer is having places for free people to run to so that there's
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:43.560]  diversity and that's why space colonies you name it undersea you name it antarctic the arctic
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:47.480]  that's why i'm so scared of the collectivists getting the global government in place because
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:53.000]  they want to shut down competition and kind of have a monopoly yes well certainly global
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:57.640]  government there's this fantasy and and sam harris talks about it there's this fantasy that if we
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:56:02.680]  have a global government we can eliminate war because as he points out there's no civil wars
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:07.160]  in america anymore because there's a strong federal government it is really not the case the only
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:12.520]  thing that we can say about the modern world is that instead of you know originally they just
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:18.680]  stole people's organs for food and so on cannibals and so on and then they ended up stealing people's
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:23.240]  bodies for labor we have at least evolved to the point where they're only stealing our money
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:27.240]  and not actually putting us to work in the fields as slaves or serfs or whatever so
[02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:34.600]  you know this is the the grim slow snail on a razor blade progress of the human species that now
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:37.480]  and now they're not even stealing our money directly i mean there's a certain amount of
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:41.160]  taxation but they're stealing it through inflation they're stealing it through death
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:46.600]  and you know as has been said by many not one in a thousand can trace what is really going on so
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:50.280]  it's this kind of weird thing instead of holding us down and just sucking our blood directly it's
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:55.080]  like they're teleporting it out of her body like cell by cell or something so there is some advantage
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:59.880]  and the that's right seeing more of what the elites do all right step on today we're gonna
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:05.400]  come back into overdrive take some phone calls info wars dot com is our site prism planet dot com

[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:40.600]  no we don't i'm not for frontier fortune teller to tell you what's going to happen but we'd like
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:44.520]  to know more and i think the president would like to more american people like to know you know if
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:49.640]  there's an attack you know what might be the repercussions and who might be engaged in those
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:54.680]  repercussions before the 11th of september in my discussion with many officials in the united
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:58:00.760]  say some of them are congressmen i used to say that don't deal with the terrorists in uh as
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:06.280]  uh playing games it's different story you're going to pay the price if you're not wise in
[02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:10.120]  dealing with the terrorists so nobody expected we said they're going to be a repercussion of the
[02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:17.240]  the second way of dealing with it of treating the terrorism but nobody expected 11th of september
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:22.520]  so you cannot expect it's difficult for anyone to tell you what's going to happen it's it's area

[03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:43.720]  thank you alex i wanted to say first of all i'm totally on board with what stephan is talking
[03:00:43.720 --> 03:00:52.200]  about it's uh you know you it's it's like a nightmare it's surreal but it's it's true
[03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:57.320]  but it underscores why i called you in the first place why i've been on hold for so long
[03:00:57.320 --> 03:01:07.480]  because i want to mention public law 112-150 and senate bill 462 which is now in committee
[03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:16.200]  it was 462 was written in march and then section two paragraph six says congress finds that the
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:22.360]  civil war in syria is threatening serious chemical weapons arsenal which could be deployed against
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:28.840]  some people or fallen at the hands of terrorists that was back in march oh yeah they've been scripted
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:34.600]  this whole thing for a year and a half i mean that's the thing is that they target their propaganda
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:38.920]  as if we're not even paying attention because it's targeting the population that doesn't know
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:47.000]  what planet they're on well section three of the of the 2012 version of this bill section three says
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:55.480]  that is it is the policy of the us to veto any one-sided anti-israel resolutions in the
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:04.200]  u.n. security council how can they put a provision like that into a u.s. law and by the way as 22
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:14.360]  usc 8602 it is the law of the land how can i mean these two bills alex are so revealing
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:21.000]  that's right that's another great point is how do you say what's anti-israel to begin with
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:27.160]  and how could you put in law something concerning another country uh talk about foreign entanglements
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:34.040]  in fact let me write that down because i was aware of that law but uh give me the log in public law
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:44.280]  112-150 that's uh 2012 and then the senate bill 462 which is now in the foreign relations
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:48.840]  committee yeah it's crazy listen listen i appreciate you bringing that up stefan there's
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:53.880]  an example of globalism now it's not just us laws more and more with these treaties and things
[03:02:53.880 --> 03:03:00.280]  we're being put under other country's laws as well yeah which is really to say that there are no
[03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:03.880]  laws because i mean one of the things that's depressing for them appreciate the call of
[03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:09.560]  bringing it up how many letters was it for that law i mean six eight ten letters or something like
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:14.440]  that i mean we really shouldn't have a legal system that's that complicated because it's impossible
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:19.000]  to obey any of these laws there's some books out there that say you and i accidentally commit three
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:24.120]  felonies a day or whether we like it or not you know how about thou shall not steal thou shall not
[03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:29.720]  kill um don't bear some false witness and maybe no raping i think that would be some pretty basic
[03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:35.480]  laws that we could all live by i mean the complexity of of what the legal system has become is so
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:40.120]  monstrous that we feel like that's seen in in brazil where robert deniro is getting eaten by the
[03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:44.040]  paper monster so the idea that there are these laws in our current society now if we're going to
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:49.320]  go into international obligations and treaties who on earth has any clue about what is legal or not
[03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:53.320]  the only thing that we know is that the elites are above the law because they can order say
[03:03:53.320 --> 03:03:57.480]  extraordinary rendition and and torture all of which are against international law they can
[03:03:57.480 --> 03:04:02.120]  invade other countries against international law not only suffer no negative consequences but you
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:07.960]  know get presidential libraries named after them pensions and speaking to us they are the global
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:14.120]  mafia but i think that their little reign is coming to an end uh unfortunately folks were out of time
[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:19.400]  sorry to the other collars if feral and martin and elliot and jeremy and others call me back tomorrow
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:23.560]  i promise you'll go to the head of the line we covered a lot of it more on the nightly news tonight
