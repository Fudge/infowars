[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:35.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.000 --> 00:45.120]  welcome my friends welcome it is Tuesday the 11th day of May 2010 well as I
[00:45.120 --> 00:50.680]  stated yesterday it was 150 plus billion that the EU banks wanted really it's
[00:50.680 --> 00:54.080]  just the global private banks then it was 600 billion then it was a trillion
[00:54.080 --> 00:59.920]  and I said it'll probably be two trillion tomorrow and sure enough that is the
[00:59.920 --> 01:08.840]  headline from Reuters and Rudge right now one trillion wasn't enough Obama
[01:08.840 --> 01:17.920]  pushed Merkel and so they're saying one trillion is not enough and they're now
[01:17.920 --> 01:23.000]  blaming Merkel that she isn't stealing enough money to give to JP Morgan Chase
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.800]  Goldman Sachs and others and so we're held hostage they're saying look we're
[01:28.800 --> 01:33.600]  just gonna let the stock market completely implode unless you give us
[01:33.600 --> 01:39.240]  trillions of dollars a month basically meanwhile they lie to you in the last 18
[01:39.240 --> 01:44.040]  months since the last crisis that if you just let the banks have trillions of
[01:44.040 --> 01:47.840]  dollars and do whatever they want with it and freeze lending to Main Street and
[01:47.840 --> 01:53.800]  the general public that magically we're gonna have a recovery as food stamps go
[01:53.800 --> 01:59.040]  up to 40 million people all-time record in the United States as major cities and
[01:59.040 --> 02:04.520]  states announced they're not gonna fix roads or sidewalks anymore that any
[02:04.520 --> 02:10.840]  police that are hired will just be used to write tickets and raise money and
[02:10.840 --> 02:19.880]  that they're going to pass VAT taxes sales taxes in fact here is a headline
[02:19.880 --> 02:26.960]  that I have today World Health Organization moving ahead on billions
[02:26.960 --> 02:32.480]  in internet and other taxes that's out of Fox News names direct links to the
[02:32.480 --> 02:36.720]  World Health Organization see all these private quasi global government
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.720]  organizations they just raised their own taxes outside of law it's like FEMA
[02:40.720 --> 02:45.200]  last year said okay 40 plus percent of the United States is now in a flood
[02:45.200 --> 02:51.200]  plane it is a national property tax and you will buy the insurance from us at
[02:51.200 --> 03:00.120]  20 billion dollars a year you must buy it and of course it's another tax to the
[03:00.120 --> 03:05.080]  insurance companies who wrote the health care takeover legislation and they're
[03:05.080 --> 03:08.760]  going ahead with the carbon tax via the executive level they don't care if the
[03:08.760 --> 03:18.480]  Senate passes a law there has never been taxation proposed at this level and
[03:18.480 --> 03:25.480]  it's all being launched like a blitzkrieg right now and the general
[03:25.480 --> 03:36.000]  public knows something is wrong but has no idea just how dire our straits are and
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.600]  they keep saying Goldman Sachs and others made mistakes we have their emails we
[03:40.600 --> 03:44.480]  have their policy reports we know they sold the derivatives to the counties the
[03:44.480 --> 03:49.080]  cities to the police pension funds the fire pension funds the private citizen
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.520]  pension funds knowing full well this was going to happen and so they
[03:53.520 --> 03:57.720]  established incredible wealth and power on the way up and on the way down they
[03:57.720 --> 04:02.800]  basically hold us all hostage and that's the elementary fact and I agree with
[04:02.800 --> 04:06.160]  Max Kaiser's analysis that we have linked up at info wars.com and prison
[04:06.160 --> 04:10.600]  blended.com and many other top analysts agree this was a engineered financial
[04:10.600 --> 04:15.640]  terrorism last Thursday to tell Congress you're not going to pass too big to
[04:15.640 --> 04:20.560]  fail legislation you're not going to audit the Fed and it was a game of
[04:20.560 --> 04:24.840]  brinkmanship and when that legislation was removed in the Senate and dropped
[04:24.840 --> 04:32.720]  they pumped the market back up and it's a psychological game by a group of
[04:32.720 --> 04:39.080]  predatory master criminals now that's some of what's coming up I have
[04:39.080 --> 04:45.200]  discovered that there is local census forms being put out by the state
[04:45.200 --> 04:47.840]  governments through the public schools wait till you hear these questions

[05:07.160 --> 05:10.720]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[05:10.720 --> 05:14.480]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in
[05:14.480 --> 05:18.360]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[05:18.360 --> 05:22.800]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they

[08:32.280 --> 08:37.720]  us economists for a full hour break down the world financial collapse that we
[08:37.720 --> 08:42.280]  are now deep into there is no recovery there is not going to be a recovery
[08:42.280 --> 08:47.760]  until the private banking cartel that is openly setting up a private world
[08:47.760 --> 08:52.840]  government no more time for denial no more time for the yuppies to giggle and
[08:52.840 --> 08:57.680]  laugh at patriots and and to feel all self-assured and wear their fake
[08:57.680 --> 09:04.600]  knowledge like an ornament or like a bobble okay do you understand this isn't
[09:04.600 --> 09:10.680]  a game they're going to take everything you've got unless you wake up and grow
[09:10.680 --> 09:15.480]  up and I'm not talking to our wonderful long-time listeners and people that have
[09:15.480 --> 09:19.520]  been out there for 50 years exposing this I'm talking to all the new listeners
[09:19.520 --> 09:24.640]  we have and the people that still think this is a joke the ADL the Southern
[09:24.640 --> 09:31.240]  Poverty Law Center ABC News that reportedly is going to air that
[09:31.240 --> 09:36.040]  nightline tomorrow we'll see if it airs laughing about world government and I
[09:36.040 --> 09:39.480]  could show them clips of world leaders calling for a banking world government
[09:39.480 --> 09:44.400]  and they would still just giggle about it because they were taught it didn't
[09:44.400 --> 09:53.080]  exist for decades and now that it does exist and is out in the open they can't
[09:53.080 --> 09:58.200]  admit that they were wrong so they still make jokes about it you ever seen the
[09:58.200 --> 10:03.000]  old footage the old newsreels from World War two how they would build a ship
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.760]  inside a giant hangar and then they would unveil it and huge curtains
[10:08.760 --> 10:14.440]  motorized curtains would pull back revealing you know the the hundred-yard
[10:14.440 --> 10:20.800]  long battleship and then they would chop the big blocks and the ship would slide
[10:20.800 --> 10:27.680]  down out of the dry dock into the canal to be launched well that's the
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.800]  analogy here patriots went behind the curtain they saw the battleship being
[10:33.800 --> 10:38.440]  built we took photos of it we got the specs of the battleship we interviewed
[10:38.440 --> 10:42.760]  workers who were building the battleship we came out and warned you and said they
[10:42.760 --> 10:47.760]  are building a battleship behind those curtains and they are going to launch it
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.120]  and they are going to implode the global economy and they are eugenicist and
[10:52.120 --> 10:56.800]  they are going to cut off the resources to absolutely bankrupt the majority of
[10:56.800 --> 11:01.400]  the population to make you dependent so phase two can go in for the hardcore
[11:01.400 --> 11:06.400]  social engineering the breakup of the family the forced sterilization China's
[11:06.400 --> 11:11.640]  the model red alert and they said oh you silly man there's no battleship behind
[11:11.640 --> 11:18.280]  that curtain well now in the last three years they open the curtains they launched
[11:18.280 --> 11:23.000]  the battleship and it's now firing on us and the uppies are saying look there is
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.200]  no battleship it doesn't exist and I just I don't even know what to say anymore
[11:30.200 --> 11:38.600]  every day New World Order defined world government run by private central banks
[11:38.600 --> 11:43.440]  who can have trillions of dollars a week if they want it to do whatever they want
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.720]  with it and if you complain about it they say shut up we're gonna have a
[11:47.720 --> 11:50.960]  depression if you don't give us this money and you're not allowed to look at
[11:50.960 --> 11:54.360]  where the money went and if you look at where it went that'll cause a depression
[11:54.360 --> 11:58.440]  we're holding you hostage there'll be martial law if you don't do what we say
[11:58.440 --> 12:04.720]  I mean that's a quote Henry Paulson and we're in a depression we're in a
[12:04.720 --> 12:16.320]  controlled implosion of our economy of our society and to watch our wealthy
[12:16.320 --> 12:19.600]  nation destroyed makes me sick you know I keep going back to this article then
[12:19.600 --> 12:25.040]  I'll get into all the latest news from two weeks ago Washington Post for
[12:25.040 --> 12:33.560]  nations living the good life the party is over says IMF what does that mean it's
[12:33.560 --> 12:40.360]  what I've heard on Charlie Rose and NPR and read in their policy reports I mean
[12:40.360 --> 12:44.600]  I read stuff from the UN 30 years ago how they were going to take over the real
[12:44.600 --> 12:50.600]  economy with a finance economy and how they would then shut off resources and
[12:50.600 --> 12:55.560]  how a free market and private property is bad and how they were gonna fund big
[12:55.560 --> 12:59.960]  agribusiness to take over the family farm and ranch and make us totally dependent
[12:59.960 --> 13:09.720]  domesticated I mean this is a stated program and now we're here I remember
[13:09.720 --> 13:14.760]  the years meeting with politicians meeting with corporate executives and
[13:14.760 --> 13:19.560]  they'd say off record Alex your journalist this is off record Alex the
[13:19.560 --> 13:23.680]  public want to be slaves they're stupid and dumb they don't need resources we're
[13:23.680 --> 13:27.440]  going to lower the standard of living but but but raise the third world to
[13:27.440 --> 13:33.880]  parody and this is just fair well that's not even what the globalists are
[13:33.880 --> 13:37.600]  actually doing they tell these mid-level executives that think they're high level
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.760]  oh you're going to be on the winning team you're gonna be part of the big
[13:41.760 --> 13:47.600]  managing elite mmm yes and we're going to raise the third world and lower the
[13:47.600 --> 13:51.400]  first world and that's what they tell the third world oh be for NAFTA be for
[13:51.400 --> 13:54.800]  GAT be for the Copenhagen carbon tax treaty until the third world in
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.320]  December actually got the treaty they wouldn't ever release it a weekend of
[13:59.320 --> 14:07.360]  the two-week summit finally it got released by the Danish by the Danes and
[14:07.360 --> 14:15.480]  the third world said no way we've got to make right at double the cuts you do in
[14:15.480 --> 14:23.240]  taxes this was supposed to be looting the rich gringos in America yeah right
[14:23.240 --> 14:27.520]  oh we're gonna get looted here too don't worry but you're gonna get double
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.680]  looted I mean what is the IMF and World Bank done to Latin America what is it
[14:32.680 --> 14:37.560]  done to Africa everyone knows who they are there everyone knows they come
[14:37.560 --> 14:42.240]  loan you a billion bucks 30 years later you've paid 50 plus billion and you
[14:42.240 --> 14:45.880]  still owe another 50 billion you will never pay it back you're not meant to
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.920]  pay it back because the IMF only lets you invest it in things that will fail
[14:50.920 --> 14:59.280]  it's simple look if you want to understand everything go to encyclopedia
[14:59.280 --> 15:04.400]  Britannica in fact guys print me encyclopedia breakdown of sharecropping
[15:04.400 --> 15:07.320]  I mean I'll give you my historical definition from research then we'll
[15:07.320 --> 15:11.360]  read the technical definition but if you want to know what sharecropping is
[15:11.360 --> 15:16.400]  I'll break it down feudalism became illegal in the last 300 to 500 depending
[15:16.400 --> 15:25.200]  on what country years in England in Spain in Portugal in France in the
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.480]  Netherlands like the Netherlands is one of the first places to really become
[15:29.480 --> 15:32.280]  free along with Switzerland with the model of freedom then they got taken
[15:32.280 --> 15:41.240]  back over by German royalty but side issue I'm digressing and sharecropping
[15:41.240 --> 15:53.160]  simple you live on someone else's land and they set it up where you plant the
[15:53.160 --> 15:59.960]  crops harvest them bring them to market and then you get maybe 20% of the money
[15:59.960 --> 16:06.240]  but it's all designed with fines and fees and rules and regulations and most
[16:06.240 --> 16:10.840]  sharecroppers had decided agreement that they would only spend their money with
[16:10.840 --> 16:18.800]  the company store so if anybody wants to know what our economy is it's a
[16:18.800 --> 16:25.080]  sharecropper economy very elementary this isn't communism it's not socialism
[16:25.080 --> 16:28.960]  it's not fascism though there's elements of all of those isms those are all
[16:28.960 --> 16:37.920]  fake those don't exist those are just a tapestry hung out another curtain a
[16:37.920 --> 16:44.640]  facade a painted background like a painted Hollywood set you know John Wayne
[16:44.640 --> 16:50.000]  and stagecoach really isn't out there in Arizona no he's on a soundstage and
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.240]  they got fake tumbleweeds blowing by and there's mountains painted in the
[16:53.240 --> 16:58.960]  background it isn't real folks so our economy is being converted from a wild
[16:58.960 --> 17:06.600]  cat laissez-faire beauty which really turns the human spirit loose the good
[17:06.600 --> 17:12.040]  the bad and the ugly and punishes mistakes and rewards daring and
[17:12.040 --> 17:17.400]  ingenuity and inventiveness the rugged individualism and it's not perfect but
[17:17.400 --> 17:20.360]  let me tell you it's better than anything else it's better than bondage
[17:20.360 --> 17:24.480]  because all there really is in this world is freedom and bondage and where are
[17:24.480 --> 17:28.680]  you on that spectrum he didn't left it in right it didn't black it in white it
[17:28.680 --> 17:34.280]  didn't Mexican-American it in Chinese Russian it in German French it in
[17:34.280 --> 17:45.440]  British Irish it's L hefe strong man dictator groups and all their different
[17:45.440 --> 17:50.040]  flavors it'd be kind of like a Jim Jones got up there and said I got 20 flavors a
[17:50.040 --> 17:56.800]  Kool-Aid here for you we got great we got strawberry we got raspberry we've got
[17:56.800 --> 18:02.720]  it all we've got apple we've got orange we've got cherry we've got pineapple we've
[18:02.720 --> 18:07.920]  got blackberry we've got whatever you want but it's all the same thing some
[18:07.920 --> 18:16.640]  sugar some dye some flavoring and he spiked it with a deadly poison cyanide
[18:16.640 --> 18:21.680]  and so I sit here watching the idiot public gulp down different flavors of
[18:21.680 --> 18:28.080]  the same crud that came from the same factory run by the same people the feds
[18:28.080 --> 18:32.240]  fund the white supremacist they fund the Mexican supremacist they fund and push
[18:32.240 --> 18:37.120]  the black supremacist in every case so we're all fighting with each other they
[18:37.120 --> 18:40.040]  fund the Democrats they fund the Republicans so we're all fighting with
[18:40.040 --> 18:44.920]  each other they fund the major environmental groups to make sure
[18:44.920 --> 18:47.800]  there's never a real environmental movement that actually challenges some
[18:47.800 --> 18:54.040]  of the serious problems and so it's sharecropping here it is sharecropping is
[18:54.040 --> 18:57.840]  a system of agriculture in which a landowner allows a tenant to use the
[18:57.840 --> 19:02.880]  land and return for sure the crop produced on the land this should not be
[19:02.880 --> 19:06.800]  confused with crop fixed rent contract in which the landowner allows a tenant
[19:06.800 --> 19:11.280]  to use the land and return for a fixed amount of crop per unit of land share
[19:11.280 --> 19:14.960]  cropping is a long history and there was a wide range of different situations and
[19:14.960 --> 19:18.280]  types of agreements that have encompassed the system some are governed by
[19:18.280 --> 19:23.160]  tradition others by law legal contract systems such as the Italian system and
[19:23.160 --> 19:27.440]  French system and Spanish system occur widely Islamic law contains a
[19:27.440 --> 19:35.520]  tradition that sharecropping agreement for the cultivation of orchards but when
[19:35.520 --> 19:39.840]  you look at the fraudulent model of sharecropping that's what this is it's
[19:39.840 --> 19:46.640]  feudalism it's a form of slavery where you don't even have to feed your slaves
[19:47.200 --> 19:51.560]  all right we're gonna come back and just get into all of it a trillion is not
[19:51.560 --> 20:01.400]  enough as I told you they want more now that's how this works stay with us it's

[21:15.400 --> 21:19.240]  being lost with time the government we once entrusted to protect from
[21:19.240 --> 21:23.040]  counterfeit has colluded with private business creating the largest fiat
[21:23.040 --> 21:27.560]  counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced this is not only a transfer
[21:27.560 --> 21:31.240]  of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government
[21:31.240 --> 21:35.120]  but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value

[25:06.960 --> 25:13.040]  JP Morgan Chase Coleman sacks running it but anybody that gets up on television

[25:37.840 --> 25:42.680]  about a trillion of taxpayer money every day and I'm sorry folks they order
[25:42.680 --> 25:47.000]  SWAT teams to come take your house to give it to Goldman Sachs or if you get
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.360]  mad about your pension fund when they get ready to take it the government's just
[25:50.360 --> 25:53.840]  gonna kill you I have a wire magazine article about 20 plus percent of the
[25:53.840 --> 25:58.200]  troops being completely mentally ill from three four five tours and how most
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.000]  of them are becoming police officers and how dangerous that is oh yeah these are
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.080]  people that are on the crazy train I mean they are cuckoo they're they're gone
[26:08.080 --> 26:15.240]  and that's who the government's looking for I mean a lot of people had mental
[26:15.240 --> 26:23.760]  problems after one tour I mean how many World War two vets great people but
[26:23.760 --> 26:26.560]  would you hear about somebody get in their face and they just kill them you
[26:26.560 --> 26:30.360]  know even when they were 60 years old 70 years old how many Korean war vets from
[26:30.360 --> 26:37.680]  one tour you imagine three four five six tours and if they don't become a cop
[26:37.680 --> 26:41.520]  they just take their second amendment away and and and you know say they have
[26:41.520 --> 26:44.680]  PTSD but if you become a cop I actually have an article on this today we've
[26:44.680 --> 26:48.520]  already pointed this out it's just it's just it's over okay we're in an
[26:48.520 --> 26:53.240]  emergency nosedive on fire it's all been scientifically figured out by the
[26:53.240 --> 27:00.520]  globalist and here I am yesterday on RT television worldwide saying I predict
[27:00.520 --> 27:04.160]  they're gonna want trillions more probably tomorrow well here it is in
[27:04.160 --> 27:10.080]  Reuters today one trillion wasn't enough they need more and by the way I've read
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.480]  the German plan it's being led by Germany it's an open-ended deal just like the
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.040]  banking takeover here 28 plus trillion and that number is like four or five
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.000]  months old now I don't I don't know what it is here let's let's just play part
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.560]  of this RT video clip it's up on infowars.com well the euro is in
[27:27.560 --> 27:31.840]  trouble and when someone or something is in trouble someone's gonna come to the
[27:31.840 --> 27:36.760]  rescue right be Superman here well that's someone might just be American
[27:36.760 --> 27:40.600]  taxpayers at least that's what radio host Alex Jones Alex Jones says
[27:40.600 --> 27:47.040]  apparently it's all part of the IMF's new bailout package but where is all this
[27:47.040 --> 27:51.720]  money actually going is it going to the European banks or perhaps the people who
[27:51.720 --> 27:56.360]  need it most Alex Jones is in Texas right now and he joins me to break all
[27:56.360 --> 28:01.080]  of this down for us hi there Alex so according to the AP the Federal Reserve
[28:01.080 --> 28:07.440]  opened a program late Sunday to ship US dollars to Europe in an effort to avoid
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.240]  a broader financial crisis on the continent what is this program and
[28:12.240 --> 28:17.800]  where is the money essentially going well it's a trillion dollars remember it
[28:17.800 --> 28:21.240]  was gonna be a hundred and fifty billion last week then it was six hundred
[28:21.240 --> 28:26.560]  billion now it's a trillion or more today it may be two trillion or three
[28:26.560 --> 28:33.480]  trillion I mean why not and just like we had the financial terrorism of 2008
[28:33.480 --> 28:38.960]  where Henry Paulson and other people from Goldman Sachs who were controlling
[28:38.960 --> 28:43.680]  the federal government went in and threatened Congress with total financial
[28:43.680 --> 28:48.240]  collapse and quote martial law if they didn't give them a blank check the same
[28:48.240 --> 28:51.840]  thing has now been done in Europe and they're not really saying where the
[28:51.840 --> 28:56.760]  money is going to go other than these these nations are gonna have to pay off
[28:56.760 --> 29:02.120]  the private banks like Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase and others and again these
[29:02.120 --> 29:07.920]  banks with derivatives made up tens of trillions of basically toxic assets that
[29:07.920 --> 29:13.880]  weren't real they sold them at full price now the governments own these and
[29:13.880 --> 29:18.960]  are in big financial trouble so they're telling people in Italy the population
[29:18.960 --> 29:22.400]  of Greece they're now telling folks in Germany they're telling people in
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.600]  Portugal and Spain we're gonna have to take all or part of your pension funds
[29:26.600 --> 29:32.320]  to pay for this bailout but it's not really a bailout it is a mass robbery
[29:32.320 --> 29:37.600]  and the people of the United States are going to have to pay for large amounts
[29:37.600 --> 29:44.600]  of this IMF and World Bank money and so this is back folks stay with us I told
[29:44.600 --> 29:53.360]  you yesterday it'd be more today and it is we're on the march the empires on the

[33:22.960 --> 33:27.480]  another one White House seeks controls on food marketing warns of national
[33:27.480 --> 33:32.600]  health crisis for children they're saying they can't put toys and happy meals
[33:32.600 --> 33:36.520]  it's up to parents to decide what their children eat the federal government has
[33:36.520 --> 33:42.360]  no jurisdiction they're taking everything over this is a worldwide plan
[33:42.360 --> 33:48.760]  meanwhile the new supreme court nominee Kagan has no judicial experience and
[33:48.760 --> 33:57.120]  they're spending it that that's why she's good oh she's off of the what about
[33:57.120 --> 34:02.200]  here one senator call it she's off of the judicial monastery she isn't part of
[34:02.200 --> 34:06.520]  people that have studied the Constitution she'll bring some fresh ideas yeah we
[34:06.520 --> 34:13.440]  have the policy reports written by her and her mentor Cass Sunstein to ban the
[34:13.440 --> 34:17.480]  second amendment to ban property rights I mean this woman would have fit in
[34:17.480 --> 34:25.480]  nicely under linen vi linen I mean you cannot make up how wicked and un-American
[34:25.480 --> 34:33.520]  and on their face evil these people aren't there is literally no way to even
[34:33.520 --> 34:40.080]  try to quantify how bad they are they are just off the charts and now they're
[34:40.080 --> 34:45.400]  saying oh North Korea shipping WMD's of Syria we've got to attack them Russia may
[34:45.400 --> 34:50.840]  build nuclear your plant in Syria yeah non weapons
[34:50.840 --> 34:54.880]  meanwhile the West is saying they're gonna put sanctions on gasoline to Iran
[34:54.880 --> 34:59.680]  Iran has lots of oil but can only refine about half the gasoline they need and so
[34:59.680 --> 35:05.880]  they say oh we'll have peaceful reactors no you can't have those either you can
[35:05.880 --> 35:10.280]  lay there and shrivel up and starve to death and die this is feudalism and
[35:10.280 --> 35:15.320]  what the globalists do to Iraq but they use Serbia they'll do here understand
[35:15.320 --> 35:21.480]  that they want you under their control this is slavery this is domination this
[35:21.480 --> 35:33.440]  is control meanwhile they're criticizing Merkel Angela Merkel German Chancellor
[35:33.440 --> 35:37.920]  and that's to give her cover Germany is the main engine of Europe of the European
[35:37.920 --> 35:43.800]  Union and she has almost lost control of her government they lost a lot of seats
[35:43.800 --> 35:46.880]  in their parliament it's not clear if she'll even be there soon just like Brown
[35:46.880 --> 35:53.520]  had to step down yesterday the leader of England but it's not clear whether it
[35:53.520 --> 35:58.160]  will be the Labor Party or the Tories or whoever because that's not clear they're
[35:58.160 --> 36:02.200]  gonna have a vote for a new labor leader within the parliament and then they'll
[36:02.200 --> 36:07.280]  have a battle over that it's a huge shake up but but I've seen what they've done
[36:07.280 --> 36:10.360]  in third world nations that have been taken over by the banks sometimes they'll
[36:10.360 --> 36:14.520]  have five six seven presidents in one year they'll just keep removing puppets
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.040]  to try to satiate the public but the establishment is still in full control
[36:19.040 --> 36:22.520]  and it's the same thing so when they come out and criticize Merkel oh Merkel
[36:22.520 --> 36:28.920]  only got a trillion dollars for the bankers that's not enough Merkel's
[36:28.920 --> 36:36.240]  caution and euro crisis weakens Germany in the EU that's right Reuters she has
[36:36.240 --> 36:41.200]  exposed her shortcomings as a crisis manager she didn't just immediately say
[36:41.200 --> 36:44.680]  it's wonderful and good and we've got to give the bankers everything she played
[36:44.680 --> 36:49.600]  politics trying to save her criminal group and said this is a rip-off and the
[36:49.600 --> 36:54.720]  banks are deceptive and the banks are criminal remember that last week oh it
[36:54.720 --> 37:00.720]  is you Merkel that will be hung out to dry you will now be the scapegoat how
[37:00.720 --> 37:07.520]  dare you you're not even allowed to play politics you're not even allowed to
[37:07.520 --> 37:14.480]  manipulate your public he will fall on the sword or you will be destroyed Angela
[37:14.480 --> 37:20.480]  Merkel has exposed her shortcomings as a crisis manager in the last few weeks and
[37:20.480 --> 37:25.120]  her growing weakness both at home in Europe could undermine her efforts to
[37:25.120 --> 37:30.320]  impose to impose they know it's over 90% unpopular in Europe what's happening
[37:30.320 --> 37:36.240]  just like the bailout was here her efforts to impose what did Hitler do over
[37:36.240 --> 37:41.920]  Poland he imposed what he do in France he imposed what did this country do to the
[37:41.920 --> 37:48.800]  Native Americans it imposed you impose when they come into a bank bank robbers
[37:48.800 --> 37:54.520]  and say stick them up give me the money or I'll blow you away they impose they
[37:54.520 --> 38:02.640]  impose Europe can undermine again Angela Merkel has exposed her shortcomings as a
[38:02.640 --> 38:07.360]  crisis manager in the last few weeks and her growing weakness both at home and
[38:07.360 --> 38:13.400]  Europe could undermine her efforts to impose the economic reforms Germany
[38:13.400 --> 38:21.880]  once in the EU the German Chancellor whose reputation has mutated from the
[38:21.880 --> 38:28.560]  blocks most skilled deal broker to madam non in a matter of months looks to
[38:28.560 --> 38:34.520]  have been browbeaten and to agreeing to one trillion we can deal to save the
[38:34.520 --> 38:41.040]  euro on top of that came sunday's
[38:41.080 --> 38:45.840]  rubbing at the ballot box in a regional vote which has undermined her
[38:45.840 --> 38:51.600]  domestic authority she imposes her authority that result which her
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.720]  conservatives blame on the Greek debt crisis may make her even more reluctant
[38:55.720 --> 39:01.760]  to show leadership in the EU what does that mean leadership means robbing
[39:01.760 --> 39:06.320]  everyone for the bankers and they will not say where the trillions going but
[39:06.320 --> 39:10.280]  then when you read the fine print the bonuses will be public the hundreds of
[39:10.280 --> 39:13.880]  billions of dollars going into the private banks coffers and the media
[39:13.880 --> 39:17.560]  keeps spin spinning this like it's the Greeks fault these Greeks are getting
[39:17.560 --> 39:22.440]  our money they're getting our American money that's all over Fox CNN MSNBC CNBC
[39:22.440 --> 39:30.840]  Bloomberg these lazy Greeks are getting our money even RT asked me the
[39:30.840 --> 39:35.340]  question you know who's getting the money are the Greeks getting it no the
[39:35.340 --> 39:40.560]  Greeks aren't getting it oh part of the money goes to the Greek government but
[39:40.560 --> 39:45.400]  then they pay it to the private banks no the Greek people have been told they've
[39:45.400 --> 39:49.920]  got to fit the biggest percentage of the bill per capita of course overall the
[39:49.920 --> 39:55.760]  largest portion is the United States and so it's this shell game but it's so
[39:55.760 --> 39:59.400]  elementary because they know the public is only halfway paying attention you know
[39:59.400 --> 40:03.600]  last week they hear those Greeks I I've got to pay my tax money to bail their
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.200]  lazy butts out of just like the you know the banker bailout of 18 months ago was
[40:08.200 --> 40:11.840]  because the people lying on their mortgage forms meanwhile none of the
[40:11.840 --> 40:15.960]  money was spent on that that's admitted it was a total red herring same thing
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.920]  it's these people with subprime mortgages it's those Greeks meanwhile it's a
[40:20.920 --> 40:30.160]  trillion plus and growing and you find out it's all on derivatives sold to the
[40:30.160 --> 40:35.840]  governments and so the big brokerage houses the big investment banks the
[40:35.840 --> 40:41.560]  central banks they sell it to you is triple a gold highest rating hundred
[40:41.560 --> 40:45.240]  percent insured you can't have a better investment it's a hundred percent no
[40:45.240 --> 40:50.960]  such thing no such thing as a hundred percent anything knowing it was pure
[40:50.960 --> 40:58.800]  crowd and now they get paid more money on top of it as debts and then they're
[40:58.800 --> 41:04.760]  going to loan that money back to the governments in debt bondage
[41:04.760 --> 41:17.840]  Merkel's caution in euro crisis weakens Germany in EU and then here's another
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.040]  little jewel for you and again when I read something from Fox I go check it
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.880]  out for myself as I do with any media operation and Fox does have the World
[41:26.880 --> 41:30.680]  Health Organization documents the third round of documents that have been given
[41:30.680 --> 41:35.280]  to them and here's the headline it's the same thing we saw at the Copenhagen
[41:35.280 --> 41:38.560]  you know they said oh we got to have trillions or the oceans will rise and
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.080]  kill you and then now we've got to have trillions of the stock markets will plunge
[41:42.080 --> 41:46.280]  and we've got to have trillions or the children will starve to death it's
[41:46.280 --> 41:52.280]  always the same story you know different crises but the same thing you must pay
[41:52.280 --> 42:00.600]  taxes through the UN and through the private banks you must do it World Health
[42:00.600 --> 42:05.600]  Organization moving ahead on billions in internet and the power to taxes the
[42:05.600 --> 42:10.800]  power to destroy and other taxes World Health Organization moving ahead on
[42:10.800 --> 42:16.240]  billions in internet and other taxes World Health Organization is moving full
[42:16.240 --> 42:20.280]  speed ahead with a controversial plan to impose billions of dollars in global
[42:20.280 --> 42:27.320]  consumer taxes did you hear that the the UN is just just calmly of the UN's
[42:27.320 --> 42:31.280]  moving ahead with billions which will be trillions billions
[42:31.280 --> 42:34.720]  constant thousands consequently millions consequently billions
[42:34.720 --> 42:42.000]  consequently trillions it was that Dallas Cowboy said that I made thousands
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.080]  consequently millions beyond Sanders yeah we ought to pull that clip up
[42:46.080 --> 42:52.280]  thousands consequently millions consequently trillions so they just
[42:52.280 --> 42:57.320]  calmly floated out there oh by the way there's some UN taxes I mean what do you
[42:57.320 --> 43:00.960]  think all these taxes are private banks are the World Health Organization is
[43:00.960 --> 43:04.120]  moving full speed ahead with a controversial plan to impose billions of
[43:04.120 --> 43:07.360]  dollars of global consumer taxes on such things as internet activity and
[43:07.360 --> 43:11.880]  everyday financial transactions like paying bills online while the spending
[43:11.880 --> 43:17.560]  sores and its own financial houses in disarray and and what has the G20 announced
[43:17.560 --> 43:22.880]  what two weeks ago London Guardian got the document VAT taxes on all financial
[43:22.880 --> 43:27.440]  transactions run by a global group of private bankers with government power
[43:27.440 --> 43:34.560]  through the G20 members I mean this is the equivalent of bankers in three-piece
[43:34.560 --> 43:38.680]  suits parachuting in with commandos and just robbing everyone I mean that's
[43:38.680 --> 43:44.680]  exactly what it is but the general public only knows about the spurs losing
[43:44.680 --> 43:49.560]  last night they they don't understand it oh they know that they're losing their
[43:49.560 --> 43:57.840]  jobs are getting pay cuts just and it just goes on from there I'm gonna cover
[43:57.840 --> 44:00.880]  more of this coming up next hour and I'm gonna get back in the whole of
[44:00.880 --> 44:08.920]  the pre-conquista thing there was a raw story article making fun of me yesterday
[44:08.920 --> 44:14.440]  but then they admit oh Fox has pulled because they're the ones producing it
[44:14.440 --> 44:19.680]  has pulled Fox put it down it was released on the Fox website Fox Studios
[44:19.680 --> 44:24.240]  they have pulled the trailer that had over three million views and they've
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.600]  pulled scores of other people that copied it and posted it normally that
[44:28.600 --> 44:32.800]  they like that for machete now I learned that they started pulling this on
[44:32.800 --> 44:36.360]  Friday we did our video report on it Saturday and they're still pulling
[44:36.360 --> 44:41.240]  videos and you can still find it but the links we have to it or or are dead but
[44:41.240 --> 44:46.720]  we did record it we are gonna play it next hour why did Fox pull the machete
[44:46.720 --> 44:53.760]  trailer well let me see it shows huge hordes and that's the way they describe
[44:53.760 --> 45:03.120]  it let me read you the let me read you the front of the movie poster now he's a
[45:03.120 --> 45:12.520]  brutal savage who must slaughter to stay alive and it shows the Texas Capitol in
[45:12.520 --> 45:18.440]  the background with flames hmm and they admit they shot this at the Texas
[45:18.440 --> 45:23.320]  Capitol with groups and of course all the white people are criminals and the
[45:23.320 --> 45:26.600]  Border Patrol are criminals and so they deserve to be hacked up with machetes
[45:26.600 --> 45:33.360]  and people are sending me emails saying this isn't even a real movie no three
[45:33.360 --> 45:38.320]  years ago in Grindhouse a double feature Rodriguez made with Quentin
[45:38.320 --> 45:44.160]  Tarantino that was when Bruce Willis was in town and Rick Linklater gave you my
[45:44.160 --> 45:47.800]  video's and Bruce Willis woke up and went public in Vanity Fair saying I'm no
[45:47.800 --> 45:51.040]  longer a Republican world government controls both parties the government
[45:51.040 --> 45:56.320]  killed Kennedy and the same people that killed Kennedy are in control now but
[45:56.320 --> 46:01.720]  when I mean I actually like Rodriguez is part of Grindhouse better than better
[46:01.720 --> 46:10.960]  than then Tarantino's piece but but they're both good and if you like a
[46:10.960 --> 46:15.840]  remake of a late 70s early 80s type action adventure I mean I love Escape
[46:15.840 --> 46:23.000]  from New York and it's kind of after that same veins I don't like living here
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.400]  in town knowing these people meeting them before and having to come out against
[46:29.400 --> 46:36.080]  something it's it's not fun it's not enjoyable but I have to do it and Fox
[46:36.080 --> 46:41.640]  was already pulling this before I even started covering it and we learned that
[46:41.640 --> 46:46.200]  in hindsight they also pulled their article on Fox News critical of it and
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.560]  their New York Post article and others and so Ross story says well we haven't
[46:50.560 --> 46:59.040]  seen the trailer but basically Alex is full of it and other news sites are
[46:59.040 --> 47:04.480]  saying the movie doesn't exist no machete is something Rodriguez has wanted
[47:04.480 --> 47:09.400]  to make for a long time according to interviews he's given and he did a
[47:09.400 --> 47:14.840]  trailer a lot of directors have done this for the film that he wanted to make
[47:14.840 --> 47:19.160]  later in Grindhouse so I can't even get members of the public to admit this is a
[47:19.160 --> 47:23.200]  real movie coming out September 3rd
[47:25.720 --> 47:31.360]  yes it's a real movie and yes this is a real trailer see this is a public that
[47:31.360 --> 47:36.200]  is mesmerized under a spell that even when something is admitted they can't
[47:36.200 --> 47:46.040]  admit it's real to themselves it is real and it dovetails with the La Raza
[47:46.040 --> 47:49.760]  videos that you've seen on drudge and other sites last few days with them
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.520]  saying we're gonna get these frail white people we're taking over our race
[47:53.520 --> 47:58.320]  La Raza is going to get them we are for communism and it is a fact that they
[47:58.320 --> 48:04.920]  had the machete rebellions in Mexico in Chiapas and in Yucatan you can pull
[48:04.920 --> 48:11.520]  these up where thousands were killed and so the machete is a symbol of peasant
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.360]  uprisings in Central America and in Mesoamerica
[48:15.360 --> 48:20.360]  southern North America and so when you have Hispanic kids who aren't allowed
[48:20.360 --> 48:25.440]  to wear American flags now because it upsets the Mexicans who call them
[48:25.440 --> 48:32.760]  port shows which means Uncle Tom see what you have is you have the big financial
[48:32.760 --> 48:38.320]  interest and the big Ford Foundation trying to radicalize Hispanics and
[48:38.320 --> 48:41.660]  trying to make sure that Hispanics aren't pro-second amendment anti-new
[48:41.660 --> 48:45.080]  world order because that could spread to Latin America no you can only have a
[48:45.080 --> 48:55.840]  communist revolution you can't have a patriot revolution and so that's why
[48:55.840 --> 49:00.200]  Fox pulled the trailer because they understand the incredible liability
[49:00.200 --> 49:03.480]  when you've got images of Mexicans running around hacking gringos up with
[49:03.480 --> 49:07.880]  machetes and the gringos are all racist and deserve it you know it's done in
[49:07.880 --> 49:12.960]  that that vein and then they say this is machete with a Cinco de Mayo message
[49:12.960 --> 49:19.520]  for Arizona I mean come on you've already got fire bombings out in Santa
[49:19.520 --> 49:27.000]  Cruz police being attacked in Miami and Arizona in Phoenix yeah there's a very
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.960]  good chance this is gonna blow up that's why not one but two I mean imagine I
[49:31.960 --> 49:36.840]  saw this Thursday I talked about it Friday didn't cover it because I was
[49:36.840 --> 49:39.480]  gonna try to get a hold of Robert Rodriguez I haven't tried I've been
[49:39.480 --> 49:43.920]  I've been busy I bet he's pretty mad now the people calling him so probably won't
[49:43.920 --> 49:49.240]  even try but I wasn't even sure I was gonna cover it I'm just like it's like
[49:49.240 --> 49:52.400]  when I see footage of cops beating innocent people most the time I don't
[49:52.400 --> 49:56.600]  even cover it because it's so sickening I don't even want to bash the police you
[49:56.600 --> 50:00.920]  know it's it's it's it's depressing and I didn't even want to get into this and
[50:00.920 --> 50:06.280]  then I get the phone calls not one but two members of his crew one of them high
[50:06.280 --> 50:09.760]  level one of them mid level who are Hispanic and they just said we're
[50:09.760 --> 50:15.600]  worried about this reflecting badly on Hispanics and yeah I mean it like it
[50:15.600 --> 50:22.280]  shows Mexicans is like savage animals and running around hacking people up and
[50:22.280 --> 50:25.480]  we didn't cross the border the border crossed us I mean this is a serious
[50:25.480 --> 50:30.640]  invocation and that's why Fox is funding it okay put the Hispanics in their
[50:30.640 --> 50:35.640]  place a bunch of dangerous savages create that stereotype I mean look at it
[50:35.640 --> 50:42.520]  now it's Jones the gringo that's upset about this it's Hispanics who've seen it
[50:42.520 --> 50:48.400]  who's seen it and because of their non-disclosure agreements they wouldn't
[50:48.400 --> 50:52.920]  tell me what's in it they just said you've seen the trailer okay it's worse
[50:52.920 --> 50:59.800]  than that it's bad I'm worried I'm worried about a backlash
[51:02.240 --> 51:07.920]  this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells are on a staggering
[51:07.920 --> 51:11.920]  pace gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate vicious

[54:25.360 --> 54:28.200]  i want to bring ted anderson up the owner of the genesis communications
[54:28.200 --> 54:30.360]  network and might as resources
[54:30.360 --> 54:33.160]  uh... here we were last week and on monday
[54:33.160 --> 54:36.640]  uh... telling you that all the smart money was on gold only going up
[54:36.640 --> 54:40.800]  and now it's continued to have all-time record highs in last month in europe
[54:40.800 --> 54:43.280]  and is now at a six-month high
[54:43.280 --> 54:47.560]  uh... above one thousand two hundred dollars an ounce right
[54:47.560 --> 54:49.400]  now
[54:49.400 --> 54:53.760]  because they are debasing the world's currencies
[54:53.760 --> 54:55.160]  unison
[54:55.160 --> 54:59.000]  right now ted anderson explained to people almost our listeners understand
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.920]  this but for new listeners
[55:00.920 --> 55:04.320]  what this means i mean the laws of economic show that
[55:04.320 --> 55:08.600]  twenty years ago a cup of coffee was ten cents i remember
[55:08.600 --> 55:12.720]  uh... ten years ago it was seventy five cents
[55:12.720 --> 55:15.280]  five years ago was a dollar fifty
[55:15.280 --> 55:18.920]  uh... it's almost two dollars everywhere starbucks is three four bucks
[55:18.920 --> 55:20.640]  uh... this is inflation
[55:20.640 --> 55:24.600]  uh... you know a mustang when i bought one when i was in college brand new
[55:24.600 --> 55:27.880]  was sixteen thousand five hundred dollars
[55:27.880 --> 55:29.480]  the same mustang
[55:29.480 --> 55:33.040]  and not even the fancy one is about thirty five thousand dollars right now
[55:33.040 --> 55:35.680]  the fancy ones are like fifty to sixty
[55:35.680 --> 55:36.560]  uh...
[55:36.560 --> 55:38.840]  it's called inflation isn't it ten
[55:38.840 --> 55:43.600]  yes inflation and it's not so much that the car has increased in value
[55:43.600 --> 55:46.680]  it has a little bit more to offer there's some there's a little bit more
[55:46.680 --> 55:50.400]  engineering behind it so maybe there is a value increase there
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.880]  but what has happened is is that the united states government along with
[55:53.880 --> 55:55.520]  now foreign governments
[55:55.520 --> 55:59.240]  have turned on the printing presses in order to solve their problems
[55:59.240 --> 56:02.200]  so we can deficit spend here in the united states
[56:02.200 --> 56:05.760]  but if there's not enough taxes to be collected to cover those deficits
[56:05.760 --> 56:07.760]  and the interest on that debt
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.320]  that the united states government has to turn to foreigners
[56:11.320 --> 56:13.840]  which we've been able to do for about the last
[56:13.840 --> 56:15.400]  you know thirty years
[56:15.400 --> 56:17.080]  china mostly now
[56:17.080 --> 56:20.760]  and they're not buying u.s. treasuries anymore which is the equivalent of a
[56:20.760 --> 56:24.680]  of a certificate of debt so now they're monetizing it which is devaluing and
[56:24.680 --> 56:27.800]  it's simple people talk about how much money they've got
[56:27.800 --> 56:31.240]  versus how much is that dollar unit worth
[56:31.240 --> 56:32.840]  that is the hidden tax
[56:32.840 --> 56:35.080]  that ron paul talks about and we see
[56:35.080 --> 56:36.600]  inflation starting
[56:36.600 --> 56:39.040]  while there's an implosion in the economy
[56:39.040 --> 56:42.640]  now completely unnatural in economic rules ten i want to hold you to the next
[56:42.640 --> 56:46.280]  segment and talk about the news and talk about what's happening in europe and
[56:46.280 --> 56:49.000]  a hundred and fifty billion and six hundred billion and a trillion and now
[56:49.000 --> 56:49.800]  more
[56:49.800 --> 56:51.240]  the trillion
[56:51.240 --> 56:54.200]  but before this hour ends
[56:54.200 --> 56:57.880]  give people today's gold offer because it's going to go up again
[56:57.880 --> 57:01.080]  people can still get gold and silver at a lower price
[57:01.080 --> 57:05.120]  that it currently is but when these stocks run out it will have to go up yet
[57:05.120 --> 57:06.960]  again now is the time
[57:06.960 --> 57:11.000]  to get up off of your hind ends folks and to start moving into physically
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.280]  holding gold and silver that is what i personally do
[57:14.280 --> 57:16.440]  and that's what i think people should do ted
[57:16.440 --> 57:20.320]  well yeah i had a fight with my traders this morning i wanted to keep the frank
[57:20.320 --> 57:24.080]  at the same price i ended up settling with two dollars more
[57:24.080 --> 57:25.240]  it should be up
[57:25.240 --> 57:29.040]  uh... twelve dollars over the price that i have it at right now which is two
[57:29.040 --> 57:31.120]  fifty six sixty eight
[57:31.120 --> 57:35.680]  promise we sold out of our inventory we're working on a newer inventory which
[57:35.680 --> 57:38.440]  the prices have gone up a little bit but that is
[57:38.440 --> 57:42.760]  way enterprise to where the market is you gotta remember gold has shot up today
[57:42.760 --> 57:45.560]  to twelve hundred and twenty five sixty
[57:45.560 --> 57:47.520]  which is only two dollars short
[57:47.520 --> 57:51.440]  of the last market peak which happened in december of two thousand and nine
[57:51.440 --> 57:54.160]  i'm confident that we're going to see that peak
[57:54.160 --> 57:56.620]  matched and surpassed this week
[57:56.620 --> 57:58.320]  yeah let's be clear
[57:58.320 --> 58:02.400]  one thousand two hundred twenty plus i mean
[58:02.400 --> 58:05.640]  it is now uh... but getting close to the all-time
[58:05.640 --> 58:08.960]  high again in europe it is an all-time high
[58:08.960 --> 58:12.120]  uh... tell folks the gold and silver offer ted yeah again right now it's that
[58:12.120 --> 58:15.600]  frank at two fifty six sixty eight alex i'm gonna give you a full year

[58:23.840 --> 58:26.480]  just buying the frank alone at that price
[58:26.480 --> 58:30.240]  nobody else has it out there is the number here's the number eight hundred

[59:59.240 --> 01:00:12.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:33.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.400]  okay I'm gonna continue with the organized implosion of the global
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:42.300]  economy but coming up in the second half of this hour I want to break down
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:48.960]  the increasingly violent rhetoric of the la raza la reconquista matcha la
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:55.880]  invasora movement and how the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist are on the
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:01.160]  internet trying to intimidate white people to join racist grips and pointing
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.800]  out all the incredible Hispanic racism and using that as a recruitment tool
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:10.600]  which is exactly what the globalist want and how Hollywood and big media are
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:16.480]  behind this and raw story delusionally implying that we're making up this
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.200]  machete trailer and that it isn't even real and doesn't exist that is delusion
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.600]  by the controlled left but going back to today Anderson Ted you know a lot of
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.840]  people don't want to just buy one fifth ounce frank coin they want to get more
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.520]  gold they want to get more silver the silver deal you've had for the last
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.680]  month is off the charts in incredible you bought it at the 15 level you've been
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:44.000]  keeping it at that with it you know up at 20 gold an all-time record 1,220
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.800]  plus and rising trying to break its all-time record here in the US it's
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.600]  broken its all-time record in Europe against those currencies against the
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:57.800]  euro this is so incredible what's happening right now Ted Anderson so more
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.280]  on the economy and tell people about some of the other coins you've got and
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.360]  what level at the market you bought those so they fully understand the type of
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.360]  discount they're getting I mean I can find no one with deals anywhere close
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.960]  to this because other traders good companies as well you know they buy
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.760]  gold and silver when it's low and then they sell it for a good price but at
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.920]  current market price when it goes up no the Ted Anderson secret is you hoard the
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.480]  stuff you sell it when it's low you sell it when it's high but when it's high you
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.080]  sell it at the lower price it's elementary but incredibly important well it is I
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.400]  mean right now if you jump over to Silver's Silver's jumping into that
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:39.600]  $19 range now and I still have that walking Liberty half at 975 which is
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.640]  what I had a price that when Silver was way down lower and closer to $15
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.480]  announced I mean the British sovereigns right now are 332 12 I mean you can pick
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.880]  up older $20 gold pieces they're starting to push up the premiums are
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.280]  starting to rise on those again like they did last time around everything is
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.520]  just moving along we have US Eagles we have Maple Leafs I mean we pretty much
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.600]  carry all the gold and silver under the spectrum if you're looking for junk
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.080]  silver we have that that's the circulated dimes quarters and halves old
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:16.600]  circulated silver dollars I mean we carry a wide variety of items but what I
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.040]  try to do is I try to pick on something that is affordable for everybody and
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:26.120]  then you know to be able to add that four-year subscription to Bob Chapman's
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:31.440]  newsletter on that Frank just makes that just a little bit above $500 an ounce
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.000]  for gold you know gold right now is sitting at a market peak that is just
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.040]  $2 short of its last high Alex when we break through that number then we're
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.280]  looking at $1300 an ounce that's what we're traveling to after that well look
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.360]  at gold what was it six seven years ago it was 300 an ounce now look at it
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.680]  compare that to any other investment again folks I don't buy gold and silver
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.680]  as an investment I buy it as an emergency backup it's a it's a fringe
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:04.320]  benefit or you know just the cherry on top whenever it becomes a good
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.320]  investment but I don't sell gold I bought at $280 an ounce even though it's
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.040]  1200 plus right now because it's an emergency backup here is the toll free
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.880]  number call and tell them it's the Alex Jones special or you will pay more and
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.000]  that higher price is still a great deal in the market but these deals Ted is
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.880]  offering are off the charts and it will go up again it's already gone up some and
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:34.160]  Ted can't hold this long 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 or go to minusresources.com

[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.040]  okay earlier in the last hour I played just a minute or two of this six minute
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:30.360]  piece from Russia today and so I want to play it in its entirety because here I
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:35.720]  am yesterday saying it's 150 billion one day it's 600 billion the next that's a
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.120]  trillion now Reuters is reporting they want more than a trillion just basically
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.720]  unlimited money going to the private central banks then I'm gonna get to an
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.720]  MSNBC video because now it's mainstream news people will pay attention to this
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.960]  Cass Sunstein who is one of the top lawyers at the White House he's the
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.760]  head regulations arm along with a bunch of other czars have called for banning
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.280]  free speech arresting people who criticize the government arresting
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:11.120]  people let's say that man-made anthropogenic global warming isn't
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:19.240]  real this is all going on this is all happening and now even MSNBC admits
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:24.400]  law would empower Hillary Clinton to revoke citizenship of whoever she
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.040]  deems to be a terrorist now this is from the senator from Arizona he's the
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:39.000]  lead senator along with his minion or his little buddy Lieberman Joseph Lieberman
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.640]  and this is really going on I mean they're really saying if we say you are
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.720]  a terrorist no judge no jury or that we think you might be a terrorist you're
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.360]  not flying you're not buying a gun you're not gonna have your citizenship
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.520]  and in the belligerent act we've been covering for two months here and I'm
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.040]  just so glad this is now out in the open I mean this wasn't even a news item as
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.320]  it moved through the Senate they're now admitting that allows them to just grab
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:12.360]  you and say you were a terrorist just like Atari the FBI of a nine member
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.680]  group one was an FBI agent one was an informant goading the leader of this
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:22.640]  tiny Christian militia whose rhetoric wasn't even racial well what happens of
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.880]  America collapses well we'll have to get with the sheriff and form a four
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.360]  county security zone they translate that into they were gonna have their own
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:37.800]  kingdom if the feds continue to come after us and fire upon us we're gonna
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.760]  have to fight back and then they would have drills of fighting the new world
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.240]  order and that was called training to kill police all lies so federal judge
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.960]  orders that released the feds have appealed it now remember meanwhile you've
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.600]  got la raza groups matcha groups and others their members calling for
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:01.480]  violence sedition organized overthrow of the country we're gonna play that video
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:07.200]  again coming up we go live at prison planet TV in 10 minutes and nothing
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:12.320]  happens see if you're a real revolutionary who wants to overthrow the
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.480]  republic and work with the bankers hey you're Prasada non-godda you're gonna be
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.880]  left alone but if you're just an American regardless of what color you are
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.400]  and you're concerned about this criminal takeover you're in trouble folks this is
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.960]  tyranny this is what the Declaration of Independence talks about where they just
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:35.080]  secretly would arrest members of the colony and ship them off to gulags so it
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:42.320]  is real it is happening and it's another window into just how bold these
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:48.760]  people are I saw an article yesterday where somebody who had age that spit on
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:54.880]  someone has been charged with bioterrorism they charge the tari with
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:01.600]  weapons of mass destruction they're charging people with guns with WMD's I
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.640]  mean just search the term Texas uses Patriot Act in drug cases and family
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:11.080]  violence Ohio uses Patriot Act they all do it thousands of times you thought it
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.920]  was for terrorists well read the internal documents that are public you
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.160]  are the terrorist and I know we talk about this a lot but it is the bedrock
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.920]  of a republic that there's due process and that we the people and the juries
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:27.680]  and the grand juries are the courts not the Pentagon at the designation of the
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:32.680]  president or any of his designates can secretly arrest you for any intelligence
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:40.560]  purpose law would empower Hillary Clinton to revoke citizenship of whoever
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.840]  she deems a terrorist that's coming up but first here is the Russia today well
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:50.760]  the euro is in trouble and when someone or something is in trouble someone's
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.360]  gonna come to the rescue right the Superman here well that someone might
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:59.080]  just be American taxpayers at least that's what radio host Alec Jones
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:04.720]  Alex Jones says apparently it's all part of the IMF's new bailout package but
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.600]  where is all this money actually going is it going to the European banks or
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.880]  perhaps the people who need it most Alex Jones is in Texas right now and he
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.880]  joins me to break all this down for us hi there Alex so according to the AP the
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.600]  Federal Reserve opened a program late Sunday to ship us dollars to Europe in
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.880]  an effort to avoid a broader financial crisis on the continent what is this
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.360]  program and where is the money essentially going well it's a trillion
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.800]  dollars remember it was going to be a hundred and fifty billion last week then
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:45.800]  it was 600 billion now it's a trillion or more today it may be two trillion or
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:52.160]  three trillion I mean why not and just like we had the financial terrorism of
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:58.040]  2008 where Henry Paulson and other people from Goldman Sachs who were
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:02.600]  controlling the federal government went in and threatened Congress with total
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:07.000]  financial collapse and quote martial law if they didn't give them a blank check
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.840]  the same thing has now been done in Europe and they're not really saying
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:15.760]  where the money is going to go other than these these nations are gonna have to
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:21.240]  pay off the private banks like Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase and others and
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:26.720]  again these banks with derivatives made up tens of trillions of basically toxic
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:32.480]  assets that weren't real they sold them at full price now the governments own
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.760]  these and are in big financial trouble so they're telling people in Italy the
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.520]  population of Greece they're now telling folks in Germany they're telling
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.320]  people in Portugal in Spain we're gonna have to take all or part of your
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:50.680]  pension funds to pay for this bailout but it's not really a bailout it is a
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.720]  mass robbery and the people of the United States are going to have to pay for
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:02.040]  large amounts of this IMF and World Bank money and so this is just the greatest
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.720]  crime of history of the private banking cartels are getting away with it so why
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:10.200]  shouldn't they just you know get away with more of it this is financial
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.360]  terrorism and when the United States Congress wouldn't go along with this
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.580]  last week and when some European leaders like Merkel were saying that the
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:23.240]  banks are deceptive and treacherous and criminal because she was worried about
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.280]  getting kicked out of office suddenly the market dropped by a thousand points
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.160]  and they've now admitted that wasn't a fat finger that wasn't a miscalculation
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:36.040]  that was these black boxes that some of the larger brokerage houses and the
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.240]  plunge protection team through the White House have they went in and drove it
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.040]  down a thousand points in just 15 minutes to create a panic in Congress
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:51.600]  and so Congress dumped the legislation to audit the Fed and to pass
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:56.720]  legislation to get rid of too big to fail so the whole world is held hostage
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:01.560]  by these private central banks and so they're just financially conquering
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:07.960]  nation after nation hell Greece gave in to being taken over so why not ask for a
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:12.200]  trillion dollars why not ask for 10 trillion well Alex you mentioned the
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:16.240]  links here to the United States Congress but does this bailout have
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.360]  anything to do with the meeting of the trilateral Commission this weekend in
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.080]  Europe and I also want you to tell our audience what this meeting is who's part
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:29.040]  of it and what's likely to come out of it well that is a great question I'm what
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.260]  you have is the trilateral Commission that was set up in 1973 by Zabignan
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.920]  Brzezinski David Rockefeller and others and its open-stated name was a global
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.240]  government run for the administrative convenience of private central bankers
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:49.240]  and they are a meeting a private meeting of what you call the G20 a private
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.720]  banking cartel who meets and they decide how to coordinate the different
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.800]  currencies and debt and the economy and so they've now announced it is the
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.800]  private global government it is the inner financial management team of the
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:09.560]  Bilderberg group of the private shadow government and they met in Dublin and
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:14.880]  folks over there in Ireland got in their face we actually have that video up at
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.880]  info wars.com and told David Rockefeller we're not giving into your
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.160]  world government we're not your slaves and Rockefeller looked very upset they
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:28.560]  then snuffed into the meeting and confronted him at his dinner table and
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:32.920]  told him the same thing in fact that was done by the sovereign independent
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.120]  that's the name of the newspaper they're in Dublin that's got these patriots
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.120]  that are out there confronting them and so what happens is you'll see an
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:45.360]  article in Australia secret bank heads meet or you'll see articles about
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:50.720]  secret of trilateral Commission meets and they always meet at key times before
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.800]  the big announcements are made you know they're telling us last week it's 150
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:58.280]  billion the trilateral Commission meets basically sets the agenda all the major
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.600]  finance ministers were there their bosses were there and then suddenly we're
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.520]  told Monday morning hey it's a trillion bucks maybe more we're the government you
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.160]  have no say in America or in Germany or in Greece or in Spain or Portugal or in
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.560]  England sit down and shut up and we've made the decision Gordon Brown's gonna
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:21.200]  step down step down we've got a new puppet this is the real government
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.360]  worldwide and Alex Alex not so secretive anymore because we have you there in
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:30.880]  Texas not sitting down and shutting up always good to have your analysis Alex
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:37.120]  Jones radio host live there for us in Texas all right folks we didn't edit

[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.960]  there it is laid out in five and a half six minutes exactly what's going on we've
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.440]  run out of time in this segment to play law would empower Hillary Clinton to
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:54.320]  revoke citizenship of whoever she deems terrorist that's up on info wars dot

[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.960]  I want to go ahead and get into the whole of reconquista situation and how
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:13.000]  the government and the media is behind this and a raw story article machete
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.120]  trailer recut to blast Arizona immigration law sparks wild race war

[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:34.160]  control I have eight pages of handwritten notes here double-sided of
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:40.040]  points I'd like to make about this subject but at the end of time let me
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.760]  just cut right to the chase I discovered in high school and then in
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:52.360]  college that not Hispanics but white teachers white professors didn't matter
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:56.920]  what class it was in high school in college told me America's bad the US
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:03.520]  stole the Southwest basically white people are bad and then I began to
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.760]  research mecha la raza la raza means for those in the race everything for those
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:13.880]  outside the race nothing and this is from the National Council of la raza's
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:18.800]  own website the term la raza has its origins of the 20th century Latin America
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.520]  literature and translates to English to mean the people of the race or according
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:29.680]  to some scholars the Hispanic people of the new world so it is a racial movement
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:35.560]  and I saw the signs and the rallies and one time I got invited down by the
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:40.040]  libertarian Longhorns and the young conservatives for a Texas Independence
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.480]  Day rally at UT and I didn't know how political this was so I went down there
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.440]  to talk about Texas and freedom in the Second Amendment and people in Aztec
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:52.360]  outfits were running around people grab the birthday cake ate it spit it all
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:58.040]  over the cake called me a racist so I thought this was like this is like 14
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.960]  years ago I just gotten on air so I thought I better research this more so I
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.440]  learned about the plan of San Diego the plan to kill all whites above the age of
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:11.920]  16 and some plans above the age of 14 I did the research and then I discovered
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:15.560]  that the Ford Foundation the CIA the federal government had spent billions
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:20.680]  of dollars in the colleges in the high schools trying to make sure that
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.520]  Hispanics don't feel like they're Americans because the globalists have
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.360]  got a problem of tens of millions of people in this country who are Hispanic
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.480]  become patriots and a lot of the culture leans towards that the only
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:36.040]  liberation theology there can be as communist or socialist or violent and
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.680]  you've got all these videos of professors and others we played you know
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.240]  where they say racist things about white people Chicano studies how they're
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.800]  gonna take over go home pilgrim there's been all these new videos the last few
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:52.240]  weeks illegals marching and burning down a restaurant and attacking 20 plus
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.680]  businesses and attacking police in Arizona Santa Cruz and it only makes
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.240]  local news doesn't make national news and so this is a problem and then on
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:07.080]  Cinco de Mayo I was sent a trailer for the new film machete comes out in
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:12.200]  September 3rd and people are in such denial they're saying this isn't even
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:17.480]  a real movie coming out September 3rd and I watched it and it basically all
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:22.480]  the white people are racist all the white people are evil they're bad they
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.640]  set up machete who's this federally to try to kill and so he agrees to try to
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:33.220]  kill a senator who is for controlling the borders played by Robert De Niro but
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:37.600]  it turns out it's the senator in a false flag that's how much that's gotten
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.480]  into the culture now trying to stage a killing of himself so that he gets
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:48.480]  political power and so the machete with armies of illegal aliens says we didn't
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:52.280]  cross the border the border crossed us and it shows the border patrol people
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:28:02.000]  in the gringos getting hacked up with machetes and on the cover of the movie
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.080]  poster it says now he's a brutal savage who must slaughter to stay alive in fact
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:15.120]  zoom in on this for me guys and says machete and this is put out by Robert
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:23.320]  Rodriguez and the reason that it's so serious is this just dovetails with
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:28.400]  everything else that's going on this fits right into the culture and then I
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:35.040]  discovered that Fox had got into a bidding war Fox Studios 20th century
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.520]  Fox and had gotten this away from the Weinsteins and that they were putting
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:46.000]  it out so then Friday I saw Fox News articles New York Post articles you know
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.200]  with the headline that Robert Rodriguez film you know has a message for Arizona
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:59.360]  you know basically violence and then they pulled those articles and then over
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:05.280]  the weekend I got phone calls from people that work inside Rodriguez's
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.320]  production they're finishing up machete right now and it's star studded
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:18.400]  cash Jessica Alba Cheech Marin Robert De Niro Don Johnson Steven Segal the list
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:24.240]  goes on and on that's when we come back I'm gonna break this down I mean the
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.800]  problem is I can't really be eloquent about it if I'm in a hurry I could spend
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:32.080]  hours on this subject so so why am I concerned about this we'll explain that
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:36.400]  on the other side but I'm a shetty trailer recut the blast Arizona immigration

[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:39.480]  video out sunday morning we shot it saturday before i ever even covered
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:46.320]  this box studios pulled the trailer that they released now why did they pull the
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:50.680]  trailer why are they scouring the web it already had three million views just on
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:56.760]  one version of it because they understand the liability by having the star of the
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:02.720]  film machete say this is a sinko demio message to arizona we're going to play
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:07.760]  that in a moment this is now the self-censored trailer we can play it
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:12.640]  it's fair use to document what's happening when fox finally realized what
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:18.640]  had been released of course they understood and they pulled fox news
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.800]  articles about it they pulled new york post articles that are also owned by
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:27.040]  news core because the left-handed know what the right hand was doing their
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:32.600]  film division put the trailer out and their director robert rodriguez put it
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.440]  out and then fox tv started attacking and saying this thing looks like it's
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:42.000]  calling for violence and again the white people are the racist you know it's got
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  all this stuff in it it's just terrible and i was contacted by hispanic members
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:55.160]  of the production on friday i'd already seen this on i guess wednesday or
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:59.640]  thursday whatever sinko demio was when they released it i was sent it i was
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:06.920]  shocked but i really didn't know what to say i didn't get to it basically and i
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.720]  was thinking about calling rodriguez first you know to say is your film really
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.600]  i mean it you know what is this because i know machete three years ago had just
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.800]  been a trailer and another one of his films but i went and looked it up it was
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:25.440]  coming out september third it is a full-length movie star studded big budget
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:32.040]  shot here in austin shot at the capital the texas capital and it's got an
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:37.040]  anti-immigration anti-open-border senator played by robert deniro and they
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.680]  say our you know mexican people are being deported you know well the quote is
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.560]  illegal americans are being deported and it's hurting all of us because of
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:51.440]  this the senator must die and then the star machete who is a federale they
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:55.120]  just think he's some guy they picked up off the street he agrees we've got to
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:59.920]  kill the gringo and he goes to kill the senator and then they try to kill him to
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:05.120]  do a false flag that's actually what the film is whether rodriguez knows is
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:08.640]  are not it's a false flag against hispanics and that's why the hispanic
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.360]  members of his crew that separately contacted me they didn't know that that
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:14.480]  each other were contacting me i said to the second person i said i was just
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:19.520]  contacted by somebody else to you did you know that they said no i said well
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.680]  what's in the film and they said well we really can't tell you but it's what's
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.680]  in the trailer and worse so i said what's in the trailer is the film and they
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.560]  said yeah you can look it up in some reviews and articles where you can find
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:34.880]  out more but but basically we're concerned about a backlash against hispanic
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:42.400]  americans and that it's could really cause some serious problems and i said
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.440]  what race war and they just said look
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.480]  one guy didn't
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:52.040]  didn't didn't say very much he just said you need to look into it
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:56.560]  and then the other persons specifically said yes backlash against hispanics
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.600]  uh... basically makes hispanics look like a bunch of murdering savages
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.640]  it's gonna scare white people
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.080]  uh... i'm because i mean this is the border didn't
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.880]  we didn't cross the border across us and
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:13.200]  you know people in the shetties are and and and don johnson saying i want to
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.000]  get that mexican i want to hang him and robert inero going look at these
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:16.960]  cockroaches
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:19.080]  with these mexican cockroaches
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.320]  so it it
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.640]  it shows the whites as evil
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.920]  and then they put a trailer out
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:27.920]  saying this is a message to arizona and then it cuts all the
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:31.280]  slashing and killing
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:36.080]  and then meanwhile here's raw story machete trailer recut to blast arizona
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.280]  immigration law
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.680]  sparks
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.000]  wild race
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.480]  war fears
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.400]  and the article basically makes fun of me
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.280]  fox had already pulled
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:50.040]  these trailers they admit they've pulled it and that's later
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.440]  in the article
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.720]  why did they do that before i ever even covered it
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.520]  anyone who watches this anyone that knows what's happening
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:00.880]  in the political atmosphere and climate knows i mean this is
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.880]  uh... ninety percent chance
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:06.400]  this one hundred percent chance is going to create division of that
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.760]  stereotypes
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.040]  i'd say over a ninety percent chance at least a ninety percent chance
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.040]  that somebody's gonna act on this and you already got fire bombings
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.480]  insane accrues of police being attacked in miami
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.160]  and phoenix
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.120]  you've already got all these clips people saying we'll use our pickaxes and
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.240]  rise up against you
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.560]  you've got all these student groups and professors and teachers shank plan a
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.360]  san diego we're gonna get the gringos we're gonna rise up
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.720]  we're coming
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:32.720]  and it's historical that machetes in latin america
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.400]  especially in central america and southern north america
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.400]  they've had what they call the machete uprisings in chiapas
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.800]  and of course in yucatan
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.960]  uh... by the native indians have been persecuted by the spanish mexicans down
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:49.000]  there see i happen to know the history so anybody that knows the history is
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.480]  concerned by this
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.880]  and it says
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.360]  what happens if the movie is based on a fake trailer
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:01.920]  and a second politicize fake trailer is leaked to help promote it so they're
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.240]  implying here in the article
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.280]  written by
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.760]  ron
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:11.600]  brine art
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:17.360]  so again they imply it's not even real no this is a real movie coming up
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:20.720]  weeks after putting on alert about illegal immigrants allegedly plotting arm
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.680]  rebellion with shovels and axes
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.880]  well they were saying we're gonna attack you with shovels and pickaxes then they
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.440]  attack the police i mean that that happened
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:31.560]  in phoenix and we've played the video
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.000]  the americans for legal immigration pack is now concerned that a new film
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.920]  which depicts an army of machete
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:42.800]  and a k-47 wielding illegal aliens is a violent uprising
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.440]  last thursday
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.960]  uh...
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:48.920]  the new york post
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:50.200]  and the new early news
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:53.960]  wrote the headline don't mess with robert rodriguez the mexican filmmaker
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:57.740]  recut an illegal trailer about illegal aliens for his new
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:03.760]  maxploitation flick machete for single-demio a message to arizona
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.440]  rodriguez passed along the re-edited
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.000]  uh... film promo to any cool news
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.840]  and i know harry knowles he's a nice guy
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:14.240]  to denounce these states recently passed immigration
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.440]  legislation
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.640]  uh... which makes it a crime for immigrants not to carry their documents
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.400]  this is machete a special single-demio message arizona star danie
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.600]  trade show says before unleashing a slew of violent
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:29.800]  expletive filled
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.760]  and sexy seems from the film
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:34.760]  and we haven't added to this trailer that's now been shut down and censored
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:37.360]  everywhere except for the cuss words that you're about to see
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.880]  the trailer offers glimpses of jessica alba
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.960]  and michelle rodriguez in the trademark eyepatch favored
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.000]  by contemporary bean movies not to mention robert inero and lindsay
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.700]  lohan
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:51.840]  the paper notes that machete is a full-length version of the fake trailer robert
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.760]  uh... roberriguez in quentin terentino directed in grindhouse two thousand seven
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.560]  that is set for release september third
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:02.080]  the controversial anti-immigration group appears to be a bit confused
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:05.520]  at the difference between a trailer in the full motion picture no this is what
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:06.840]  the film's about
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:11.120]  is an uprising in texas so they're saying it's a message arizona we've now got
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.440]  the plot of the movie
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:18.280]  it's exactly what we thought it's a false flag event
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.280]  and uh... it just goes on it says foxes now pulled the content and pulled
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:24.440]  articles about it and pulled the trailer
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:28.560]  it says alex jones in his prison planet empire have also launched a crusade
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.440]  against the flick
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.440]  based on the illegal trailer
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:35.920]  now we have a call for pulling it we haven't uh... we've just simply pointed
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:36.680]  out that
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:39.200]  if that's the content of the film and it is
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:42.000]  a political violent message against the gringo this is going to cause
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.880]  problems
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.720]  in late april
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:52.400]  rostro reported political debates based on arguments and reasoning
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:53.400]  are becoming
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.480]  passay in modern day then it goes on to imply that
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:58.680]  that we're just lying and making this up
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:01.440]  uh... ladies and gentlemen we're not making anything up
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:05.800]  that's why before i even covered this on sunday before i said word one
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:08.600]  when that video went live my video exposing this
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.320]  their index put together did a great job by the way on sunday that now has
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:16.720]  about a hundred thousand views
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.400]  just on one version
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:22.680]  fox had already pulled it fox had pulled articles critical of it
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:27.160]  they don't even want you knowing about this
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:31.760]  and i had been contacted by hispanics who worked on the crew who've seen the
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.080]  film and they
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.560]  are concerned
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.920]  i'm not telling rodriguez what to do i know he's editing the film finishing it
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:43.960]  right now do what you want buddy i'm just getting it on record
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.800]  that because you mix this in with arizona
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:49.840]  and are now basically blurring the lines and implying
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.800]  that this is what needs to be done
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.840]  i hope to have been
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.400]  you have some restraint i have to have restraint every day i've got to watch
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:59.720]  what i say about calling for violence or implying it
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:03.280]  look at the tari militia federal judges ordered them released now
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.680]  they were arrested in charge with terrorism weapons of mass destruction
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:10.480]  for having guns and for saying on an audio tape we may have to fight the
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.520]  government one day of this continues
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:19.240]  meanwhile you've got these illegal alien rallies where they're saying things
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.960]  a hundred times more serious
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.880]  and i'm against
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:27.480]  violence folks and and this is going to hurt hispanics people who think oh well
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:30.280]  you know that as i've seen the comments on my video that i posted
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:33.040]  uh-huh cracker gringo you're going to get it
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.680]  you know white people are evil and i link over their page they've got all
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:39.080]  this little raza and mattress stuff up there
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.520]  it's just so stupid
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:45.720]  this is about playing everyone off against each other
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:48.560]  just like the government's been caught funding the clan and how turner in the
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.640]  white supremacist and radicalizing the black panthers
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.560]  and black professor saying we've got exterminate all whites we played that
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.720]  last week
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:00.600]  this is adding to this divide and conquer atmosphere
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:03.000]  and so it shows the political correctness though
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.640]  that you got a film
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.320]  hispanics are more savages white people are all racist
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.120]  and anybody that wants to control the border which every other nation does
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.360]  including mexico you're evil
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.880]  you're bad
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.640]  i mean this is outrageous
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.640]  this is politically laced
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:22.000]  this is what's in the film
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.720]  what is in this trailer is is what is in this film and notice he wanted to make
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.640]  this back in the mid nineteen nineties when he was already successful director
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.040]  they never picked it up
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.680]  it's now been funded in the last year and a half by fox studios and it's now
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:34.920]  coming out
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:39.000]  because the system not the rod regus is i think cia are part of this but look at
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.200]  the timing the system knows when to use things so let's play the trailer here
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.360]  the censored
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:48.200]  a self-censored trailer uh... by fox
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.200]  twenty century fox studios
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:54.720]  before i ever covered this they were pulling it because again i'm being
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.440]  contacted by the crew who are hispanic
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:04.200]  and are upset about this they're not stupid here it is
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:06.760]  this is much at the
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:10.080]  the special sinkhole in my own message
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:15.760]  to arizona
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:19.480]  they call the end of the city
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.640]  seventy dollars a day for the yard work
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.560]  hundred for ruffin
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:26.760]  get in
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:28.800]  one twenty five percent
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:31.000]  they've ever killed anyone before
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.200]  as you know illegal americans are being forced out of our country at an alarming rate
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.440]  for the good of both our people
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.440]  the senator must die
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:42.640]  he was given an offer he couldn't refuse
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.640]  make no mistake we are at war
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:47.760]  every time an illegal dances across our border
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:52.600]  it is an act of aggression against the sovereign state an overt act of terrorism
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.840]  set up
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.160]  double cross
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.720]  and left foot dead
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:58.400]  you think what you do is right
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.840]  taking your brothers and sisters in
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:05.240]  deporting them back to their own personal house
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:11.240]  there are many laws
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:14.240]  you want me to help you kill all these men
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.480]  yes bro
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:22.480]  see what i can do
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.480]  he's coming after us
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:38.240]  he knows the score
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:40.240]  he gets the women
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:48.240]  there's nothing i'd like more than to see that mexican dance the bolero at the end of the road
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:51.240]  and he kills the bad guys
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:53.240]  we didn't cross the border
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:47:02.240]  the border crossed us
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:07.240]  now this is the first official trailer
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:24.240]  now let's go to a clip from two weeks ago
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.680]  now this is the first official trailer
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:31.640]  now let's go to a clip from two weeks ago
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:37.640]  two weeks after this lady and others said we'll rise up with our pickaxes and attack you
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:40.640]  the police were then attacked and stood down
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.640]  now imagine if
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:44.640]  a tea party did this
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:50.640]  they'd be called terrorists all over the news or if a tea party burned down a restaurant and attacked 20 shops in Santa Cruz
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640]  now here is this lady
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.640]  i mean this is what's really being said
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.640]  in mexico
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:58.640]  the peasant uprisings are symbolized by machetes
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.640]  whereas in european history it's by pitchforks
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:05.640]  so this is a pitchfork movie where the gringos are bad
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:08.640]  and it mirrors what's actually being said here's a clip
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:11.640]  we will not stop
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:16.640]  we will take up our shovels and our pickaxes and we break the land
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:20.640]  and make our landscaping and clean your toilets and our pickaxes
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:22.640]  we will use them against you
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:25.640]  believe that
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:28.640]  okay now i want to go to break
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:35.640]  with another clip here this is la teacher he's at ucla with some of his high school students
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:40.640]  calling for mexican revolt in the united states and folks this is all just the last week
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.640]  just go put la raza matcha professor calls for violence
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.640]  i mean you'll have ut dallas head of chicano studies you'll have
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.640]  just hundreds of clips
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.640]  hundreds and hundreds of clips
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:55.640]  saying we don't want white people here we're going to get you
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:00.640]  we're going to go out to break with this come back and finish it up here it is
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.640]  i want to start off by saying that the young man who spoke a little while ago
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.640]  he was one of my students
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:11.640]  and that made me so proud because i know that our people have strong leaders
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:14.640]  for years and years to come
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:26.640]  as a militante a union del barrio a revolutionary mexican organization here
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:30.640]  we understand what the camaradas saying you're right this is not just about mexico
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:34.640]  this is about a global struggle against imperialism and capitalism
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:40.640]  but we know that all of that is happening in the context where we now stand
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.640]  is stolen occupied mexico
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:49.640]  that's addition
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:55.640]  and the message that we bring if you want to bring a little bit more of a revolutionary context to this
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:02.640]  why is it that these people these frail racist white people want to keep us out of this country
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:07.640]  it's not because simply the color of our skin it's not simply because they just want to exploit us
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:12.640]  let me tell you why because on this planet right now a six billion people
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:17.640]  at the forefront of the revolutionary movement is the raza
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:25.640]  when you are a venezuela
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:31.640]  when you go we have the long history and example of our comandante fidel gastro rus
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:44.640]  we are going to come back and finish this and then he goes on to say you are revolutionaries
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:50.640]  we're going to overthrow the united states for communism and we're going to kick the frail white people out of here
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:55.640]  now that is somebody who says he's a mexican and he's on government payroll
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:51:00.640]  and he's not going to get fired he's not going to get in trouble he's going to be promoted he'll probably end up being mayor

[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.640]  we have Fidel Castro-Ruz
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:11.640]  we have Hugo Chavez
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:12.640]  Evo Morales
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.640]  we have Brazil
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.640]  you name it
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:20.640]  we have nine, nine left of center
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:22.640]  governments in Latin America right now
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:28.640]  and they know something that a one young Argentine called Che Guevara said
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.640]  it was all the domino theory
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:34.640]  and he knew that every single country would go revolutionary
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:45.640]  one after the other, after the other, after the other
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:47.640]  so what do they fear?
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:50.640]  they know that every single country
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:55.640]  they know that we no longer will fall to these lies called borders
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:59.640]  we know that a Salvadoran and a Guatemala and a Nicaraguan and a Mexicano
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:01.640]  there's no damn difference
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:02.640]  we are all one people
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:04.640]  so with that in mind
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:06.640]  we see ourselves all of us here
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:12.640]  as the northern front of a Latin American revolutionary movement
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:25.640]  there are more than 40 million of our people
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:28.640]  north of the Rio Grande
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:34.640]  that means to them there's 40 million potential revolutionaries
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:37.640]  north of the border inside the belly of the beast
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:42.640]  so when you think about why do they want to keep us of all people out
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:43.640]  that's why
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:45.640]  because they know that we now know the truth
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:48.640]  they know that now we are raza
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:50.640]  we're professionals, we're educators
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.640]  we are revolutionary students
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:53.640]  what does that mean?
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:55.640]  we are not just a regular culture anymore
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.640]  we are a culture of revolutionary spirit
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:00.640]  and that's the fear
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:09.640]  so with that being said
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:11.640]  I want to leave you with this
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.640]  as a revolutionary
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:14.640]  and with revolutionary context
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.640]  let's be clear about one thing
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:18.640]  our enemy is not the Minutemen
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:19.640]  call me
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:21.640]  our enemy is not the Minutemen
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:24.640]  because the Minutemen are not the ones
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:27.640]  that killed over 4,600 people at those borders
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.640]  our enemy is the same enemy as Hugo Chavez
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.640]  that Hugo Chavez has
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:35.640]  our enemy is the same enemy that keeps Africa poor
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.640]  our enemy is the same enemy that keeps Asia poor
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.640]  our enemy is capitalism and imperialism
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:45.640]  yes
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:52.640]  and I finish with this
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:54.640]  I finish with this in respect to time
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:57.640]  if we are serious about making change
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.640]  if you are serious about making change
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:00.640]  let me tell you
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:02.640]  the struggle will go on for many more years
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.640]  after we leave ECLA
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:05.640]  reading a book
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:06.640]  or writing a book
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:07.640]  or teaching a class
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.640]  that is not
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.640]  that is not part of the movement
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:13.640]  what you do 24 hours a day
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:15.640]  as a professional revolutionary
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:18.640]  that is what are going to lead our people
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.640]  and our people to liberation
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:23.640]  ok, Viva la Raza
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.640]  again he is saying these frail white people
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:29.640]  don't worry about them
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.640]  it's the system
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.640]  it's the border patrol
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.640]  and in the new machete film
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:35.640]  they go to the border patrol
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:36.640]  Hispanic members
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.640]  and get them to then go preach
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:39.640]  we didn't cross the border
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:41.640]  the border crossed us
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:44.640]  with machetes
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.640]  think about it
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:47.640]  Hispanic Americans in San Francisco
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.640]  who had American flag shirts
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:52.640]  were kicked out of school
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:53.640]  there's a new video
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:54.640]  where a girl in California
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:56.640]  drew a picture of an American flag
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.640]  and was told that was bad by her teacher
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.640]  this is the mindset
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:03.640]  and then we've got new video
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:06.640]  of people driving with an American flag on their car
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:07.640]  and the illegals running up
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:09.640]  and pulling it down
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:11.640]  just the sight of the flag
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:13.640]  because this is Mexico
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:15.640]  not Spain
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:16.640]  not France
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:17.640]  not all the other countries
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:19.640]  that had part of the southwest
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:20.640]  Mexico was just one country
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:21.640]  that had a claim on it
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:23.640]  no, it belongs to Mexico
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:25.640]  and how many clips could I play
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:27.640]  where the pilgrims need to go home
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:28.640]  and all this
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:29.640]  but this is being done
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:31.640]  to create division
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:33.640]  Robert Rodriguez is being used
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:34.640]  with his film
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.640]  already have violence breaking out
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.640]  and we're gonna see what happens in September
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:45.640]  you are listening to GCN

[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:56.640]  a high volume pre-production order

[01:58:58.640 --> 01:58:59.640]  by waiting for production
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:00.640]  and shipping of their orders

[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:06.640]  I want to show people

[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:09.640]  I want to cover this with Tarpley coming up
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:11.640]  after we get into what's happening
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:12.640]  with the global meltdown
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:14.640]  with the economy with the euro
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:16.640]  with the trillion that just got grabbed
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:18.640]  now that said Hagan
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:19.640]  disappear free speech
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:21.640]  if the government deems a defensive
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:23.640]  and it's now admitted that she
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:26.640]  literally has no judicial experience
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:28.640]  but she is a Goldman Sachs minion
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:30.640]  she is an acolyte of
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:32.640]  Cass Sunstein who says
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:33.640]  ban free speech in America
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:35.640]  arrest people that say
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:37.640]  man made global warming isn't real
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:39.640]  I mean you gotta go read their quotes
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:41.640]  they write public papers on this
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:44.640]  this is tyranny and the
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:47.640]  schoolteacher who's at UCLA
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.640]  calling for revolution in the united states
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:51.640]  for communism he says
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:53.640]  hate speech is not free speech
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:56.640]  that's the big banner behind him so
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:00.640]  so we don't get our free speech
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:02.640]  we don't even get our mild free speech
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:04.640]  you've seen the mainstream media trying to frame
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:06.640]  yours truly
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:08.640]  nightline was here two weeks ago
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:09.640]  supposed to air tomorrow night
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:10.640]  we'll see if that happens
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:12.640]  in fact as you call nightline
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:13.640]  they said it was going to air this Wednesday
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.640]  we want to make double sure thank you
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:17.640]  here it is
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:19.640]  dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:21.640]  we're going to go over this
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:23.640]  and dovetail it with Kagan
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:24.640]  disappear free speech
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:26.640]  if the government deems it offensive
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:27.640]  so you think about this
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.640]  Americans that want free market
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:30.640]  want private property
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:31.640]  want second amendment
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:33.640]  something that no one else worldwide has
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:35.640]  they've taken most of the farmers land
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:36.640]  in Australia
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:38.640]  supposedly for the carbon tax
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:39.640]  I mean I can play mainstream news pieces
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:40.640]  saying it's good
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:42.640]  you know the farmers are shutting down
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.640]  they're not allowed to have sheep anymore
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:44.640]  or cows
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:45.640]  it hurts the earth
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:47.640]  I mean just you just don't get the land
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:50.640]  I mean just so draconian
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:53.640]  no no the revolutionaries are for slavery
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:54.640]  they're for collectivism
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:55.640]  and that's because our government
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:57.640]  and our CIA and our media
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:59.640]  these parasite organizations
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:01.640]  the only avenue of revolution
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.640]  that they're taught about
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:05.640]  is one into big government tyranny
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:07.640]  and that's why the big government
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:08.640]  funds all of this
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:10.640]  hate speech is not free speech
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:12.640]  the banner behind him
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:13.640]  reads
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:14.640]  you can read the full banner
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:15.640]  when that lady walks over to him
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:17.640]  to tell him his time's up
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:21.640]  just incredible
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:23.640]  absolutely off the charts
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:24.640]  amazing
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:26.640]  and they want the American people
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:27.640]  at each other's throats
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:28.640]  but I tell you it was booing
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:31.640]  it made me feel a lot better
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:33.640]  Sunday when I only took calls
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:34.640]  from Hispanic Americans
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:35.640]  and I said you can call in
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:36.640]  if you disagree with me
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:37.640]  if you agree you can call in
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:38.640]  if you're from Mexico
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:39.640]  and disagree with me
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:41.640]  every caller
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:42.640]  called in and said
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:43.640]  I want to be an American
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:44.640]  I want the second amendment
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:46.640]  I want private property
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:48.640]  I know what's going on
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:49.640]  but they did say
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:50.640]  my daughter
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:51.640]  my son
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:52.640]  my neighbor
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:53.640]  they're now part of Raza
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:54.640]  they're now communist
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:56.640]  they now want the overthrow of America
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:58.640]  they call me a porcho
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:03:59.640]  which means rotten fruit
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:00.640]  it's like Uncle Tom
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:01.640]  why?
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:02.640]  because you want to own your own property
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:03.640]  you want to have a chance
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:04.640]  to not be taxed into oblivion
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.640]  look what napton gat has done
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:07.640]  and it's hurt Mexico
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:08.640]  they forced the people off their land
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:10.640]  forced them up to Miquiladoras
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:12.640]  now those are almost completely shut down
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:13.640]  it's all moved to China
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:15.640]  I don't blame people for wanting to come here
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:17.640]  and if we didn't have a big welfare system
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:19.640]  where they got them here
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:20.640]  made them dependent
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:21.640]  got them on the government dole
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:23.640]  trained them to be anti-second amendment
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:25.640]  it wouldn't be that bad
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:27.640]  but you notice what the communist says
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:29.640]  he says it isn't that these frail white people
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:31.640]  don't like us because we're brown
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:32.640]  I'm going to tell you the truth
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:34.640]  it's because they don't like communism
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:37.640]  yeah
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:39.640]  absolutely
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:41.640]  I mean where are Hispanic leaders
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:42.640]  who call for patriotism
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:43.640]  and find the new world order
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:44.640]  they're out there
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:45.640]  they need radio shows
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:47.640]  they need to be elevated
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:49.640]  they need to lead people
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:50.640]  like the great folks that we are
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:51.640]  changed San Antonio
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:52.640]  most of them are Hispanic
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:54.640]  these are patriots
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.640]  like Medina and others
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:57.640]  we need to lift them up
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:00.640]  we need to promote them
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:01.640]  hi this is Alex Jones
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:02.640]  did you know that the global elite
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:04.640]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:05.640]  in secret storage vaults
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:06.640]  near the Arctic Circle
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:08.640]  did you know that in a real meltdown
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:09.640]  non-hybrid seeds could become
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:11.640]  more valuable than silver or gold
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:13.640]  it's true seeds have outperformed
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:15.640]  even gold and silver before in this country
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:17.640]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:19.640]  so our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:21.640]  have put together the perfect mix
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:22.640]  of non-hybrid seeds
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:24.640]  they call it a survival seed bank
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:26.640]  and it can produce
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:28.640]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:29.640]  for you and your family
[02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:30.640]  and here's the best part

[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:02.640]  they helped to create a new world order
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:04.640]  we are part of a new world order
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:07.640]  a new world order based upon collective action
[02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:09.640]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:12.640]  of the globalists through their own words and documents
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.640]  the new world order really is a tool
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:17.640]  for addressing a new world of possibilities
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:19.640]  it means all the world under their control
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:22.640]  the United Nations would take over America
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:25.640]  the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:28.640]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:30.640]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:33.640]  to establish an oppressive world government
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:34.640]  I believe first of all
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:37.640]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:38.640]  for the global financial system
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:41.640]  global governance with the establishment of a G20
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:43.640]  so it's going to be an inner ruling elite
[02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:45.640]  and then everyone else

[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:27.640]  and of history
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:29.640]  Weftragriffetart police predictions
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:31.640]  are devastatingly accurate
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:34.640]  they would call him a progressive
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.640]  I mean he does believe he had government options
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:39.640]  I don't completely agree with his
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:41.640]  some of his views on that but his analysis
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:43.640]  of the markets and the power structure
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:45.640]  is one of the most accurate out there
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:47.640]  and he's written two books
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:50.640]  Barack H. Obama the unauthorized biography
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:52.640]  about the controlled left
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:55.640]  Reverend Wright, the Mecheloraza stuff
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:58.640]  and Obama the postmodern coup
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:00.640]  and I've got him on this hour
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:02.640]  and a little bit into the next
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:04.640]  to talk about the thousand point drop
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:06.640]  what's happening in Greece
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:08.640]  now it was 150 billion and 600 billion
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.640]  now a trillion
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:11.640]  now they want more than a trillion
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:14.640]  the White House has Kagan saying
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:16.640]  disappear free speech
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:18.640]  if the government deems it offensive
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:20.640]  a Larry Summers minion
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:22.640]  a Cass Sunstein minion
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:24.640]  we've got CNN and MSNBC
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:26.640]  saying it's good
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:28.640]  that Hillary Clinton can strip you of your citizenship
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:30.640]  and secretly arrest you
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:33.640]  if she wants we'll cover that before Webster leaves
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:36.640]  I mean this is bona fide tyranny
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:38.640]  and they're about to have a Supreme Court justice
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:40.640]  who would be more at home in Nazi Germany
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:42.640]  or Maoist China
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:44.640]  now I want to put a plug in here
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:46.640]  the people are ready to be awakened
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:48.640]  the people are ready to hear the truth
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:50.640]  the people are ready to fully understand what's happening
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:52.640]  two films
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:54.640]  the Obama deception
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:56.640]  out over a year with Webster Tarpley
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:58.640]  the most successful film I've ever released
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:00.640]  people will see this
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:02.640]  everything in it came true
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:04.640]  part two out for six months
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:06.640]  follow the republic
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:08.640]  Tarpley's one of the key people
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:10.640]  Max Kaiser's in it, many others
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:12.640]  Jesse Ventura
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:14.640]  you have got to get this film
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:16.640]  you're grease next
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:18.640]  a year ago
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:20.640]  two new films, police state for the rise of FEMA
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:22.640]  documenting Northcom
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:24.640]  the homeland security takeover program
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:26.640]  the executive orders, the arrest of citizens
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:28.640]  what they're really setting up
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:30.640]  conservatives have got to see this particularly and liberals
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:32.640]  so they understand anti-terror is for the American people
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:34.640]  such an important film a year in the making
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:36.640]  Jason Burmes' new film
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:38.640]  a year and a half in the making
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:40.640]  Invisible Empire, a new order defined
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:42.640]  that it's really an old world order
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:44.640]  it's oligarchs, they're crimes
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:46.640]  they're narcotics trafficking
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:48.640]  all of it available at infowars.com
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.640]  you can simply call toll-free

[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:54.640]  and your purchase also
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:56.640]  funds our operation
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:58.640]  we're not funded by the Ford Foundation
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:00.640]  we're funded by your support
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:02.640]  I want to thank you, you have made what we do here possible
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:04.640]  get the book
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:06.640]  Barack H. Obama the unauthorized biography
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:08.640]  if you want to really know what's going on, what's behind Obama
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:10.640]  Obama the postmodern coup
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.640]  that's available at infowars.com
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:14.640]  of course he also wrote the unauthorized
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:16.640]  biography of George H. W. Bush
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:18.640]  and all of his Nazi ties
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:20.640]  I mean Tarpley is an equal opportunity
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:22.640]  offender, he just goes
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:24.640]  at the facts
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:26.640]  now Tarpley heard me during the last segment
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:28.640]  playing the Ford Foundation
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:30.640]  operative and all these
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:32.640]  speakers everywhere at these open
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:34.640]  borders rallies saying
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:36.640]  we are communists, we're going to overthrow America
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.640]  we're going to kick the gringos out
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:40.640]  they want division, just like
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:42.640]  over and over again, every month
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:44.640]  top white supremacists that comes out
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:46.640]  are feds
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:48.640]  so Webster Tarpley, you were one of the
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:50.640]  probably the leading expert, I mean both these books cover it
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:52.640]  on the Ford Foundation
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:54.640]  on the CIA, Washington Post admits
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.640]  for 50 years they sent radical
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:58.640]  textbooks to madrasas
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:00.640]  all over the Middle East, Central Asia
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:02.640]  really
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:04.640]  expanding the Muslim Brotherhood
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:06.640]  expanding what the Germans had done in World War II
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:08.640]  into this ultra radical group
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:10.640]  so that they won't politically work with others
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:12.640]  explain what's happening
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:14.640]  on this before we get into
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:16.640]  the economy. Well just briefly on that
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:18.640]  this raving character
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.640]  that you're quoting is all over
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:22.640]  many radio stations, Rush Limbaugh
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.640]  gave a great deal of attention
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:26.640]  to this character and the obvious
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:28.640]  truth about him is
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.640]  this is not some authentic
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:32.640]  honest person who believes in
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:34.640]  Mao or whatever it is and wants
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:36.640]  a revolution, this is a
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:38.640]  cynical money-grubbing shill
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:40.640]  he is a provocateur
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:42.640]  funded by the foundation
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:44.640]  and his job is to get out there
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:46.640]  and spout the most
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:48.640]  inflammatory rhetoric that he can
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:50.640]  so that you work people up into a hysteria
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:52.640]  there's a grave danger
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:54.640]  this week that people would say
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.640]  it's time to crush Wall Street
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:58.640]  it's time to shut down hedge funds, wipe out
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:00.640]  derivatives, put Lloyd Blankfein
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:02.640]  of Goldman Sachs in jail
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:04.640]  at this point the
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.640]  wonderful foundations
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:08.640]  come forward conveniently
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.640]  with a diversion to say
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:12.640]  don't worry about Wall Street
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:14.640]  don't worry about Citibank and Bank of America
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:16.640]  robbing you blind and
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:18.640]  raping your entire family
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:20.640]  and the future to come
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:22.640]  let's focus on wetbacks
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:24.640]  let's get out there and get some
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:26.640]  good anti-Hispanic
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:28.640]  anti-Latino hysteria going
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:30.640]  and then we can play that
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:32.640]  that's divide and conquer
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:34.640]  it's the oldest game in the world
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:36.640]  and in the course of writing those books
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:38.640]  you were kind enough to mention
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:40.640]  this is Obama's background
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:42.640]  what do you think Jeremiah Wright was
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:44.640]  the guy at the church
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.640]  who has all the abuse for America
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:48.640]  and U.S. of KKK
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:50.640]  who pays him?
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:52.640]  well foundations pay him
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:54.640]  they pay him to make this kind of stuff
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:56.640]  ultimately into a religion
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.640]  that's what he represents
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:00.640]  30-40 years ago
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:02.640]  with their bombings of various
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:04.640]  public buildings from the Pentagon
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:06.640]  to the capital to New York City police headquarters
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:08.640]  same thing, divide and conquer
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:10.640]  I get extremists out there
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:12.640]  make them the face of protest movement
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:14.640]  and then it's easy to isolate
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:16.640]  and destroy the protest movement
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:18.640]  it's time to wake up to manipulation
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:20.640]  we also have this American Indian
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:22.640]  movement we have all kinds of foundation
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:24.640]  funded operatives in those
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:26.640]  and in the Hispanic community
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:28.640]  they get their money
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:30.640]  a lot of it from the Ford Foundation
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:32.640]  oh no, I mean they're completely bankrolled
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.640]  they're completely bankrolled by the Ford Foundation
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:36.640]  and the Fortune 500
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:38.640]  but let's go back
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:40.640]  Robert Rodriguez put a trailer out
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:42.640]  for a film coming out in four months
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:44.640]  in September, September 3rd
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:46.640]  we by the way just got the script
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:48.640]  it's what we thought, I have people inside
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:50.640]  his organization separately contact me
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:52.640]  who are Hispanic and they said
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:54.640]  we're worried about a backlash against Hispanics
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:56.640]  on this, we wish you would cover it
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.640]  and all I had was the trailer
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:00.640]  Fox has now pulled the trailer
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:02.640]  but it shows that all whites are basically racist
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:04.640]  an uprising of machete Hispanics
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:06.640]  have to fight the racist gringos
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:08.640]  it says
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:10.640]  we didn't cross the border, the border
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:12.640]  crossed us, I don't think Rodriguez is a bad guy
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:14.640]  I don't know about this guy
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:16.640]  I'm talking about this character who makes this
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:18.640]  speech in this
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:20.640]  no I know, but I mean that's standard for these things
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:22.640]  but this is what I'm saying
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:24.640]  what do you think of a major movie
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:26.640]  injecting the same type of
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:28.640]  rhetoric put out by 20th Century Fox
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:30.640]  I don't know
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:32.640]  this movie is something I haven't seen
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:34.640]  and I haven't been able to pay any attention to it
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:36.640]  in the midst of this financial panic
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:38.640]  but the one thing we know
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:40.640]  is that the people who lead these
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:42.640]  movements are provocateurs
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:44.640]  they're paid agents of foundations
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:46.640]  then of course
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:48.640]  you have dupes, you have people who get caught up
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.640]  into the ideological
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:52.640]  extremism and the fanaticism
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:54.640]  and it becomes cool and it becomes the way
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:56.640]  to go so they go with the flow
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:58.640]  I can't comment on individuals obviously
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:00.640]  but the general idea
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:02.640]  that you should now focus on
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:04.640]  questions of race or ethnicity
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:06.640]  it's pure insanity
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:08.640]  the great rule of politics is
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.640]  fight Wall Street if you're not fighting bankers
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:12.640]  you're spinning your wheels
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:14.640]  you're cutting your own throat
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:16.640]  you're betraying every value
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:18.640]  because the main center of evil is in Wall Street
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:20.640]  with it and wake up
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:22.640]  okay I want to go over all this
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:24.640]  this just broke minutes ago
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:26.640]  Senate unanimously approves measure
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:28.640]  to audit the Fed
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:30.640]  but there were two different bills
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:32.640]  it was watered down
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:34.640]  because Rahm Emanuel issued a threat to Bernie Sanders
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:36.640]  and Bernie Sanders
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:38.640]  rolled over in the last two days
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:40.640]  and radically diminished
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:42.640]  what was being audited
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:44.640]  so there is some auditing
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:46.640]  at least it's a precedent
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:48.640]  we'll have the
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:50.640]  I guess it's the
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:52.640]  general accounting office go into the Fed
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:54.640]  and find out something
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:56.640]  about 2007-2008
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:58.640]  but it's very limited
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:00.640]  it's much less than was originally planned
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:02.640]  but at least it gets a wedge in there
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:04.640]  so take it from there
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:06.640]  it's a beginning not an end
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:08.640]  all right Webster I just want to put an end cap
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:10.640]  on the issue
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:12.640]  that's why I've been covering this
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:14.640]  is because people even inside the production
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:16.640]  are worried it's going to cause a backlash
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:18.640]  so you agree with me
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:20.640]  plus that's the evidence
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:22.640]  that this is a foundation-funded operation
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:24.640]  to divide Americans
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:26.640]  and basically just like white supremacists
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:28.640]  try to intimidate whites to join them
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:30.640]  saying how dare you
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:32.640]  there's a move by the foundations
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:34.640]  to radicalize Hispanics
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:36.640]  absolutely this is beyond question now
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:38.640]  the specific case again I don't know it
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:40.640]  you know that much better than I do
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:42.640]  but as a general rule
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:44.640]  that's no cultural racist
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:46.640]  xenophobic
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:48.640]  nativist no-nothing
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:50.640]  stuff or on the other side
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:52.640]  the anti-gringo
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:54.640]  this is simply
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:56.640]  an obvious ploy
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:58.640]  these are provocateurs
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:00.640]  this is a foundation strategy
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:02.640]  to divide and conquer
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:04.640]  and the beneficiaries in Wall Street
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:06.640]  so let's turn our attention to them
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:08.640]  and then meanwhile you've got all over the country
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:10.640]  kids can't wear American flags in the school
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:12.640]  I mean I don't think the
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:14.640]  the false flag
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:16.640]  is down the local school
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:18.640]  these are ideological fanatics
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:20.640]  in other words these are people who
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:22.640]  in a crisis like this
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:24.640]  when you have the entire society collapsing
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.640]  many people especially in the petty bourgeoisie
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:28.640]  typically teachers
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:30.640]  people like this they
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:32.640]  they go bonkers right they don't know what to do anymore
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:34.640]  right the world is collapsing
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:36.640]  before their eyes right the stock market
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:38.640]  goes down a thousand points in ten minutes
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:40.640]  their world is collapsing
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:42.640]  so you can expect all kinds of bizarre
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:44.640]  extreme behavior
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:46.640]  but I wouldn't get so worried about this
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:48.640]  turn the fire on Wall Street
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:50.640]  is the great rule
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:52.640]  well that's why we've got you here five minutes into the next hour
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:54.640]  and then we've got one of the people
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:56.640]  that's in the great new film don't tread on me
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:58.640]  Rise of the Republic
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:00.640]  featuring RJ Harris
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:02.640]  Michael Bagnarek Alex Jones
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:04.640]  Evan Vieira Richard Mack
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:06.640]  Cynthia Davis Charles Key Tom DeWise
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:08.640]  and many many others great new film

[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:14.640]  the difference between democracy and a republic
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:16.640]  Bob Rule and the Republic
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:18.640]  Gary Franchi and William Lewis present
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:20.640]  don't tread on me it comes out next week

[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:24.640]  you want to educate people about

[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:28.640]  powerfully done and of course I'm a big part of it
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:30.640]  don't tread on me now available
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:32.640]  at infowars.com
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:34.640]  okay Webster what we're going to do then
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:36.640]  is I want you to break down
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:38.640]  what's happening with a thousand
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:40.640]  point plunge with the financial
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:42.640]  terrorism the
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:44.640]  trillion and now they want more
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:46.640]  than a trillion
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:48.640]  and it's just getting worse by the minute
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:52.640]  we will cover all of that
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:54.640]  on the other side and what this is leading to
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:56.640]  is this the beginning of the giant
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:19:58.640]  worldwide financial meltdown that Webster's
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:00.640]  talked about for more than a decade stay with us
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.640]  this is Alex Jones with five good
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:04.640]  reasons you should consider buying a solar
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:06.640]  power generator number one
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:08.640]  new climate legislation could easily double
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:10.640]  or triple your electric bill number two
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:12.640]  our new energies are wants to control
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:14.640]  how much power your electric company
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:16.640]  allows you to have it's true
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:18.640]  total government control of electricity
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:20.640]  in the name of smart grid technology
[02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:22.640]  is coming number three in some
[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:24.640]  areas of the country the power grid is
[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:26.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:28.640]  socialist legislation is only
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:30.640]  compounding the problem number four
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:32.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:34.640]  grids every year thousands of families
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:36.640]  lose their power from weather related
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:38.640]  onages number five a solar power
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:40.640]  generator provides powerful backup

[02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:18.640]  resulting in the restricted sale

[02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:22.640]  including colloidal silver
[02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:24.640]  we must take immediate steps
[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:26.640]  to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:28.640]  for ourselves and our families
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:30.640]  act now to acquire the means of producing

[02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:36.640]  colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic
[02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:38.640]  used for more than 200 years
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:40.640]  as a natural alternative to costly drugs

[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:27.080]  And they're even admitting she has almost no judicial experience, and they say, oh,
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:28.080]  that's good.
[02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:32.520]  She's an outsider who believes they can violate the First Amendment and arrest citizens.
[02:33:32.520 --> 02:33:36.520]  She supports the legislation where you can be secretly stripped of citizenship and shipped
[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:37.520]  away.
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:39.000]  And this has a good chance of passing.
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.600]  I mean, that's how serious the times are.
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:44.760]  This is bonafide, hardcore tyranny.
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:48.320]  Going back to Webster Griffin-Tarpley, okay, so we have a thousand-point drop.
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:52.600]  The Wall Street Journal is even admitting this, that ties into what our guest yesterday
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:57.160]  was saying with these pre-sale orders and this manipulation.
[02:33:57.160 --> 02:34:02.480]  Now we hear it's Greece, 156 billion, then it's 600 billion, then it's a trillion.
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:07.200]  Now today, the Reuters headline, they need more than a trillion.
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:09.080]  And people are saying, where is the money going?
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:10.080]  What's happening?
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:12.320]  They're saying, this came out of nowhere.
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:17.960]  Well, not according to you, Gerald Salente, Dr. Roberts, many others we've had on.
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:18.960]  This was all coming.
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:21.280]  I mean, a year ago, put this in the Obama deception.
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:27.000]  We named Greece, you named Portugal, you named Spain, you named Italy.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:32.320]  Write down the list, and now the U.K., our debt ratios in the U.S. are as high as Greece.
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:36.080]  They're saying, austerity, that's all you talk about in the Obama deception in the fall
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:37.440]  of the Republic.
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:41.240]  And the head of the IMF laughs two weeks ago and says, the good times are over.
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:42.400]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.160]  We're going to take over the whole economy.
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:46.200]  So what's happening in Europe?
[02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:47.200]  Where is this going?
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:48.200]  What's behind it?
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:53.760]  Well, the common basis between this catastrophe in Wall Street, the 1,000-point drop, and
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:56.880]  the attack on Greece is a couple of things.
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:59.480]  Hedge funds using derivatives.
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:05.920]  Hedge funds using derivatives attack the New York stock market, and hedge funds using derivatives
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:06.920]  attack Greece.
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:12.680]  A good reason to ban hedge funds, to ban many kinds of derivatives, to ban credit default
[02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:16.280]  swaps, which are the kind that are being used to attack Greece.
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:21.320]  Credit default swap means you're saying, I, sitting in a basement in my bathrobe, I'm
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:27.480]  an insurance company, and I can sell credit default swaps as insurance against the bankruptcy
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:30.200]  of some company that I know nothing about.
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:35.120]  And I have no cash reserves, and there's no state registration, there's no authority
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:36.120]  over me.
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:37.120]  It's absolute lawlessness.
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:38.880]  This is now the free market.
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:39.880]  It's the abyss.
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:42.120]  So it's time to re-regulate all of that.
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:46.240]  Now, in terms of the Europeans, we talked, I believe, on Sunday night.
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:49.360]  When they were putting this together.
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:53.560]  What was already clear then was that this was a systemic crisis.
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:59.680]  In other words, a breakdown crisis threatening the disintegration of a large part of the world
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:03.720]  financial system, specifically the Euro and the European Central Bank.
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:07.400]  Whatever you think of those institutions, and obviously, nobody likes them.
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:13.920]  I mean, I don't like them, but the idea that a chaotic collapse and catastrophic disintegration
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:16.800]  of these things would be good for anybody is very wrong.
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:21.120]  But what is clear is, by Friday, you had this systemic crisis.
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:23.640]  Trichet, the head of the European Central Bank, said so.
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:28.200]  All the rain, this faceless bureaucrat of the European Commission who runs these matters
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:30.240]  for them, has said the same thing.
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:36.920]  The systemic crisis was the crisis of interbank lending, what they call the interbank plumbing.
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:42.080]  It's the willingness of Barclays Bank to lend money to Deutsche Bank and vice versa,
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:49.840]  Banco de Bilbao, Santander, Unicredito of Italy, Societé General de France, BNP Paribas.
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:54.600]  We know all these big European zombie banks, so they had reached the point where every
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:59.280]  bank was looking at every other bank and saying, I don't trust you because you have Greek bonds.
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:02.360]  And the other bank would say, I don't trust you because you have Portuguese bonds and
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:03.800]  so on down the line.
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:07.280]  So that had frozen, and that had frozen by Friday.
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:09.640]  That was the emergency.
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:14.360]  That is what you had in the United States right after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:21.240]  They are in the 15th, 20th, 25th of September, 2008, systemic breakdown crisis.
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:28.440]  So therefore, the European Finance Ministers get into this emergency meeting there in Brussels
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:34.640]  on Sunday, and they come up with this $1 trillion monstrosity.
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:40.560]  And basically, everything that could be wrong with this is wrong.
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:42.560]  It's not really money.
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:44.800]  It's a commitment to come up with money.
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:51.520]  It's like Paulson coming out in, oh, hey, the Secretary of the Treasury saying, we will
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:58.200]  ask Congress for a $750 billion bailout of Wall Street derivatives.
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:37:59.200]  That has to be voted on.
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:03.120]  And you can remember, right, there was a moment when the House of Representatives said, no.
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:08.280]  I think you've got 27 parliaments in the European Union that will have to vote on this.
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:09.280]  That's going to be chaotic.
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:11.320]  There may be somebody who says no.
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:17.440]  There are 16 countries that are in the euro, not everybody who's in Europe is in the euro,
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:20.880]  and they will also have a say.
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:26.000]  The thing that ought to interest us is the international monetary fund of this awful
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:33.360]  Krauss-Kahn that you've just mentioned, the guy who laughs at human misery and genocide,
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:34.360]  really.
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:42.360]  They are going to give $40 billion US to Greece, and they're also supposed to come up with
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:45.800]  250 billion euros.
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:52.360]  Let's call that, what, $300 billion, $350 billion US?
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:58.560]  I'd say it comes to $400 billion US dollars in loans from the International Monetary Fund
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:02.960]  to Greece and to the European Union and to these other countries.
[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:11.520]  Well, remember, the US government represents 17.5% of the IMF, so almost one-fifth of that
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:12.520]  money.
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:19.240]  You can say something like $70 billion US dollars is being given by you, the taxpayer,
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:24.000]  to these countries, but the real culprits are those hedge funds.
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:28.800]  You can thank the hedge fund hyenas and the zombie banks because these governments are
[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:33.080]  now putting their hands in their pocket, your pocket, to get this money.
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:34.080]  Well, that's right.
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:38.400]  The governments are going to be giving a lot of this money to the very culprits that sold
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:44.480]  them the derivatives, and when you talk about a 1.5 quadrillion, there's no way to ever
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:45.480]  pay this off.
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:50.320]  It's designed as a financial weapon, and we have the big private banks saying, we're
[02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:52.800]  now going to establish a bank of the world.
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:58.720]  You're going to pay a global VAT financial, not from the banks, but from the people on
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:01.200]  all financial transactions to them.
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:05.520]  There's going to be a new UN tax that's in the news today, World Health Organization
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:10.720]  moving ahead on billions on internet and other taxes, and so boil it down for us.
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:12.120]  Where is Europe going?
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:13.480]  Why do we see Brown leaving?
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:17.440]  Why do we see Merkel in trouble, Sarkozy in trouble, saying no to the carbon tax?
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:19.640]  How do you see this fleshing out?
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:24.880]  Because yesterday they said, we're saved, the trillion saves us, and then now today,
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:27.720]  I have the headlines, they say, it's not enough.
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:28.920]  It's still going down.
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:29.920]  We need more.
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:30.920]  Well, yes.
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:33.440]  In other words, bailouts don't work.
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:39.080]  The two things we ought to start with is bailouts don't work, austerity doesn't work.
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:42.760]  You cut the budget this year, you think you're going to balance the budget for the next
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:47.840]  year, low and behold, you cut the budget now, your deficit will be bigger next year because
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:52.280]  your cuts have destroyed significant parts of the economic activity of society.
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:57.000]  You've taken government workers and other workers and made them into unemployed or even
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  welfare recipients.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:04.800]  And we see that happening now, where California raises taxes but actually cuts services and
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:06.600]  the economy implodes even faster.
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:07.600]  They know that.
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:08.600]  Absolutely.
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:12.680]  Everybody has known that since Cain's and even before, and it's obvious.
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:16.600]  The other thing is bailouts don't work, and we see this now.
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:22.600]  This trillion dollars was able to get the euro up by two American pennies, and now it's
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:27.920]  down to one American penny, I think, because I'm looking at the screens here.
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:28.920]  So this has failed.
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:32.640]  And if you look at the European banks, the ones that I just mentioned, Deutsche Bank
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:35.840]  and Barclays and the rest of them, they are going down today.
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:38.360]  They're down two, three, four, five percent.
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:41.240]  So it is a failure, yes.
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:43.840]  This trillion is not enough.
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:48.600]  The approach that they should have taken is to say, if you're under attack by hedge
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:50.720]  funds, ban hedge funds.
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:54.560]  Now there was a discussion in the European Parliament yesterday that if you have hedge
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:58.800]  funds from outside of Europe that want to come in, they have to get a passport.
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:03.040]  In other words, they have to get a permit to do their speculative dirty work.
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:07.480]  And that would be a start, except that the process in the European bureaucracy, they
[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:09.360]  take one to two years.
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:10.360]  That's hopeless.
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:13.760]  In two years, there won't be any more European Union.
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:14.760]  There won't be a euro.
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:16.760]  There won't be a European central bank.
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:20.800]  And by the way, you've been saying that forever and saying 2010, 2011.
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:24.800]  I just want to be on record, Tarpley, that you've been very accurate.
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:30.840]  And now they're going from always denying that the EU could collapse or that our country
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.080]  could collapse.
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:36.360]  They're now admitting that the euro is in serious danger of collapsing.
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:40.000]  So let's talk about A, what you think is going to unfold versus what you think they
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  should do.
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  We know they're not going to do what you recommend.
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  But you don't know that.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.400]  But wait, here, in terms of defaulting or a debt moratorium, there's no question that
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:50.400]  they will.
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:51.400]  They will default.
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:53.200]  They will stop paying.
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:59.880]  The only question is when and will it be orderly and do they have a strategy for economic
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:00.880]  recovery?
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:04.880]  Because I tell you, you look at these countries, Greece will default, guaranteed.
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:09.640]  And that means, and so will the other nations, then like Italy, Portugal, Spain.
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:11.160]  What does that mean then?
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:12.920]  That means monetization.
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:13.920]  That means devaluation.
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:22.480]  It means that they should now say, get ahead of all that and say, look here, Greece, Portugal,
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:27.920]  Spain, Italy, Ireland, I'll get a debt moratorium, debt freeze, stop payment.
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:31.160]  Just do it in an orderly legal way now.
[02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:35.080]  Don't destroy the economy, because now people are complaining on Bloomberg and CNBC.
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:39.720]  They're saying, yeah, wait a minute, the Greek austerity program is already impacting the
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:45.640]  European economy in a bad way, because that means fewer orders, fewer jobs, depressed
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:48.520]  economic conditions, loss of activity.
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:49.720]  So that stuff doesn't work.
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:50.720]  Don't even try it.
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:54.920]  And you might as well include Iceland, you better include Latvia, then there are some
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:59.720]  non-Euro European countries, Hungary, Romania, plus some others.
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:02.840]  Let's stop there, though, and of course, Ukraine.
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:04.880]  What is this going to do politically to Europe?
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:07.520]  We already see the politicians dropping like flies.
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:11.040]  Yeah, but right now, this is the other interesting news over the weekend is, remember, when you
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:18.000]  go back to Germany in 1930, 1930, 1332, you get this question of ungovernability, that
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  the parliamentary system breaks down and can't work, and this is where the US is heading
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:24.000]  to.
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.360]  But just over the weekend, two big countries have become totally ungovernable.
[02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:31.240]  The British are ungovernable now because they have a hung parliament.
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:37.960]  There is no majority, there's no party that has a clear, absolute majority, 326 members
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:39.440]  of the House of Commons.
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:40.440]  Nobody has it.
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:46.160]  So now you get this very sleazy horse trading, you know, the worst side of parliamentary
[02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:51.600]  cretinism coming out among Gordon Brown, who's now on his way out, this Clegg, who is the
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:57.320]  dawning of the media, and then this very sinister oligarch, this guy who's got the whole British
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:59.920]  aristocratic pedigree, Cameron.
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:05.440]  So and everybody knows that what that government is going to do is take the knife to the flesh
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:10.360]  of the British people and flay them alive in order to pay for the bailouts that Gordon
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:11.360]  Brown carried out.
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:12.360]  Right?
[02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:17.080]  He's the guy who invented the bailout for Northern Rock and for Royal Bank of Scotland
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:18.240]  and Lloyd's Bank.
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:20.320]  So Britain is ungovernable.
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:21.560]  Let's look at Germany.
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:29.400]  This wretched woman, this stupid Merkel, has lost her majority in the upper house of the
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:30.400]  German parliament.
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:35.360]  This goes back to the elections on Sunday in North Rhine, Westphalia.
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:38.320]  That used to be the industrial heart of Europe.
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:43.880]  It used to be, well, it's Cologne, Düsseldorf, Essen, Bochum, these kinds of places.
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:45.480]  It's the biggest federal state in Germany.
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:51.040]  Now the Christian Democrats, so-called, of Merkel have lost 10% of their votes there.
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:54.480]  They're probably going to lose the domination of that state.
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:59.720]  You probably get a social democratic government with the Greens and maybe the Left Party.
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:01.920]  Anyway, Merkel loses it.
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:04.520]  So in Germany, you have the upper house of the parliament.
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:07.440]  It's called the Federal Council, the Bundesrat.
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:11.040]  And in this Bundesrat, that's where these states are represented.
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:15.560]  The fact that North Rhine, Westphalia has now been lost to the Christian Democrats means
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:20.080]  that Merkel can't get her stuff through and she's already got a coalition government.
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:24.040]  So two of the biggest, probably the two most important countries in Europe, from various
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:27.760]  points of view, Britain and Germany, now, ungovernable.
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:32.960]  And I think that's what you have to look at rather than the fates of different politicians.
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:38.520]  The one person who could act in the crisis is Sarkozy because thanks to General De Gaulle,
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:43.680]  the French Fifth Republic Constitution gives the French president the most sweeping emergency
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:44.680]  powers.
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:47.640]  He could come out tomorrow and say, I'm banning hedge funds.
[02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:49.840]  I'm banning credit default swaps.
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:53.520]  I'm banning CDOs and other things.
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:56.680]  And they also ought to get busy on that Tobin tax, right?
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:47:03.080]  The sales tax on derivatives to slow down and throw sand in the gears of these speculators.
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:08.280]  Webster, I understand that specifically, though, with the decisions they're making.
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:11.520]  What does this say about the global financial system?
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:16.280]  And are you revising your forecast for a total global economic collapse?
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:21.520]  Because even if all these great policies got put in place, the black hole is already
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:28.360]  so big, we know the media is lying when they say that the economy's turned around.
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:32.200]  Well, you can stop a depression in very short time.
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:34.640]  There's no reason to live in a depression.
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:39.200]  Anybody who says that the only thing to do in a depression is let it bottom out, let
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:41.560]  it crash down, and then you'll have a recovery.
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:45.600]  That is pure insanity because that kills, and it's also not necessary, it's not even
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:46.600]  true.
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:49.880]  There's no guarantee that there's some kind of business cycle that will lift you out
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:50.880]  of this.
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:53.920]  As a matter of fact, what we have now is this is not a business cycle anymore.
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:55.400]  This is not a recession.
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:59.880]  It's a world economic depression, and it's a disintegration, and this integration will
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:07.680]  be the euro, as various countries catastrophically drop out, grease, or get thrown out, you'll
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:10.480]  have panic runs on different currencies, right?
[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:13.880]  Some of these non-euro places like Hungary, right?
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:18.080]  You'll have a panic run on them, or Poland, and then you'll have a panic run on the euro,
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:21.120]  and that will break up the European Central Bank.
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:26.440]  The British think they kid themselves that they can stay out of this.
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:29.120]  They're being sucked in even as we speak.
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:34.680]  The pound will go down, and once you have a panic run on the pound, and the bankruptcy
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:40.520]  of the main British banks, that gets the US directly because we have this euro-dollar
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:46.640]  market, several trillion US dollars that have been parked in London for many, many decades.
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:52.120]  If the British banks get into absolute bankruptcy and panic, with panic runs on them and also
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:57.480]  on the pound, they will have to start dumping those euro dollars, and that will be the straw
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:00.280]  that breaks the camel's back vis-a-vis the dollar.
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:02.280]  Don't wait for China or anybody else.
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:05.920]  It's going to be the British, and that's very interesting because this is the role the British
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:14.880]  have typically played in 1929, 1933, 1971, and now just now, in 2008, with Barclays Bank.
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:19.560]  The British, who generally stabbed the US in the back at the key moment of a financial
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:25.440]  crisis by trying to save themselves, or also with malice, trying to export the depression
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:26.440]  to the US.
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:31.880]  So that means that the second wave of the depression is here, and the third wave cannot
[02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:32.880]  be far behind.
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:38.800]  The second wave is the collapse of Europe, from Greece now, through the southern European
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:44.800]  euro countries, to the British, and then immediately over to the US, and the US, on the US side
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:49.800]  of course, there's still room for the collapse of the dollar, panic runs out of the dollar,
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:52.680]  and of course, panic runs on the Federal Reserve.
[02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:53.840]  What happens to Asia?
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:50:00.960]  Mark Fauber and others are saying, 90% chance in the next year that China is going to implode.
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:07.880]  Well, I think we can start with Japan, since the big brouhaha is about sovereign debt.
[02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:10.240]  Japan is one of the most indebted countries.
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:15.280]  Japan has, I think the public debt is 200% of gross domestic product.
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:21.080]  If you look on most of the list, Japan is second only to Zimbabwe in the amount of debt, so
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:23.520]  Japan is very heavily indebted.
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:28.160]  On the other hand, Japan still has a very significant industrial economy, so they can
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:33.440]  save themselves, but they would also be candidates, ultimately, for some kind of a debt moratorium.
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:35.920]  In other words, a freeze on these debts.
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:39.840]  Yeah, we know there's no way to pay off all these fake derivatives.
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:46.480]  It's designed to bring the world into collapse, and they'll reorganize it with this pipe dream
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:51.120]  of a world government run by bankers, as if the public worldwide is going to put up with
[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:52.120]  that.
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:53.120]  I mean, that's too overt.
[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:54.120]  Webster, stay there.
[02:50:54.120 --> 02:50:58.720]  Let's move gears into the domestic front and the new Supreme Court nominee who wants our
[02:50:58.720 --> 02:51:01.600]  free speech.
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:04.560]  Times are tough and you gotta stretch that dollar.

[02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:04.040]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:09.480]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.480 --> 02:52:13.760]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:14.760]  documents.
[02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:19.160]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:19.160 --> 02:52:21.640]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:24.400]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:27.720]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:32.640]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:35.160]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:35.160 --> 02:52:39.640]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:40.640]  financial system.
[02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:45.160]  The global governance with the establishment of the G20, so it's going to be an inner ruling
[02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:47.200]  elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:50.040]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[02:53:00.920 --> 02:53:05.800]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've got to try MyPillow, introducing the most revolutionary,

[02:54:18.760 --> 02:54:19.760]  Here's a headline.
[02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:22.600]  This is from Raw Story from Obama supporters.
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:24.160]  You can actually read her clothes.
[02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:29.200]  Kagan supported detaining terror suspects indefinitely without trial, including U.S.
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:30.200]  citizens.
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:33.600]  That's your new Supreme Court nominee, to be the next justice.
[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:35.920]  The center is to be detained as enemy belligerence.
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:42.320]  This is the bill introduced by John McCain and others.
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:45.800]  And it says that any high-value detainee, including citizens at the direction of the
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:50.400]  Pentagon, Department of Defense or the president, that you can be secretly arrested for any
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:55.120]  matters such as the president considers and secretly stripped of your citizenship and
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:55:00.040]  you can be given enhanced interrogation, only an act of Congress can have you even
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:01.600]  relieved.
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:03.440]  Just total end of our system.
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:05.960]  Here's another article today, Kagan.
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:08.720]  Disappear free speech of the government deems it offensive.
[02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:14.840]  We have the links to the article she's written and she is an acolyte of Larry Summers and
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:23.520]  of course a minion of the White House regulations, our Cass Sunstein that says, you can go pull
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:27.040]  up his quotes, wrote a white paper, that if you disagree with man-made global warming,
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:28.240]  you should be arrested.
[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:30.000]  It should be outlawed.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:36.440]  I mean, imagine, we're about to have a Supreme Court justice that says, we can ban speech
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:37.440]  in America.
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:42.360]  I mean, this is just, it's so bold, Webster, and I bet the Republicans are going to slide
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:43.360]  around in there.
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:44.360]  I mean, they love this too.
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:46.000]  This is right up their alley.
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:50.560]  I mean, these people are absolute criminals.
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:55.760]  I mean, to be someone who wants to be a Supreme Court justice, who wants to ban free speech
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:55:59.760]  in habeas corpus, that is treason, is it not?
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:02.320]  I guess I would say so, but here's the thing.
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:07.760]  In line with my general rule that the center of evil is Wall Street always.
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:09.280]  And she's one of their minions.
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:10.280]  She's a Goldman Sachs.
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:11.280]  She's from Goldman Sachs.
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:13.280]  This is the main point.
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:14.280]  Goldman Sachs.
[02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:15.280]  Goldman Sachs.
[02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:16.280]  Goldman Sachs.
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:19.520]  Let's have another representative of Goldman Sachs taking over the government, right?
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:21.680]  It's not enough to have Geithner.
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:26.960]  It's not enough to have Summers, Geithner's chief of staff, Paulson Bernacke, all the
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:27.960]  major regulatory agents.
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:32.800]  It's not Goldman Sachs, or if not Goldman Sachs, the same thing, JP Morgan Chase, Citibank,
[02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:33.800]  and so forth.
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:40.640]  So, this woman represents what was known in the 1930s as totalitarian liberalism.
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:42.800]  And this was associated with Keynes, right?
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:47.080]  Don't think that Keynes was anything good, even though you somehow have to talk about
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:51.400]  him in terms of economics from time to time, just to make clear what you're talking about.
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:55.880]  She's a totalitarian liberal, and that's what this stuff comes down to.
[02:56:55.880 --> 02:57:00.120]  I think, though, we've got to also realize what's going on in the world.
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:05.800]  If we go back to the 1930s, we see a three-part process.
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:08.280]  You have depression.
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:10.120]  Depression leads to dictatorship, right?
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:15.680]  The depression leads to Hitler, frankly, right, Nazism, and that leads to World War.
[02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:22.360]  Now, we're still in the beginning, or the second phase of the depression phase.
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:25.480]  The question, therefore, is stop the depression.
[02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:31.360]  If you don't stop the depression, you will have it necessarily, practically automatically,
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:36.080]  the collapse of representative government, the collapse of democratic institutions, the
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:40.120]  collapse of the rule of law, is inevitably going to be swept away.
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:41.120]  You can see that.
[02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:45.080]  But how much more obvious does it have to get where your J.P. Morgan chaser, Goldman
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:48.880]  Sachs, or Citigroup, or Wells Fargo in every position?
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:52.520]  Soon, you won't be able to be a county judge unless you're one of their people, and I see
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:53.520]  them doing that.
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:54.520]  A dog catcher.
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:55.520]  You won't be able...
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:58:00.200]  I mean, literally, will Goldman Sachs, people start wearing gold crowns and call themselves
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:02.320]  Emperor Maximilian III?
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:08.280]  Well, remember, I would actually argue that J.P. Morgan Chase and probably Morgan Stanley
[02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:10.680]  represent even a higher level of this stuff.
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:12.640]  Yeah, they're a criminal crew.
[02:58:12.640 --> 02:58:14.120]  Higher levels, right?
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:17.240]  Insurance companies in general sometimes represent a higher level of...
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:19.680]  Well, they were the ones that passed the healthcare bill.
[02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:21.320]  That's really money for them.
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:27.280]  So, but the idea, therefore, is I would say it's time to develop an awareness of what
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:28.280]  this is.
[02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:33.120]  Well, Wall Street owns Washington in the same way that it owns everything else.
[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:34.120]  And if you don't want to...
[02:58:34.120 --> 02:58:36.080]  Yeah, it's like a third-world country run by the bankers.
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:43.400]  Stay there back in 70 seconds with a final hour.
[02:58:43.400 --> 02:58:45.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:02.960 --> 02:59:11.920]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:19.920]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:25.160]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:59:25.160 --> 02:59:30.120]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:36.920]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:41.480]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you could

[02:59:46.560 --> 02:59:54.160]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:59:54.160 --> 03:00:03.800]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:08.920]  I just want to say, at the start of this fourth and final hour, that I am so proud of my entire
[03:00:08.920 --> 03:00:14.360]  team, the radio production team, the TV production team, the filmmakers, the webmasters, the
[03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:20.640]  writers, the work we're doing at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, just incredible news
[03:00:20.640 --> 03:00:21.640]  and information.
[03:00:21.640 --> 03:00:26.920]  A roadmap, a blueprint for what's happening in our world and how to take our society back.
[03:00:26.920 --> 03:00:35.440]  Michael Bagnarek, former nominee for the Libertarian Party for president, will be joining us, barely
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:39.960]  survived a heart attack a few months ago, but he's up and fighting, he is coming up
[03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:40.960]  the next segment.
[03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:46.400]  Webster, I mean, it's the top six global banks, maybe ten of you count some big European
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:52.720]  banks, openly running around robbing everyone, creating counterfeit derivative crap that
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:57.120]  they started pushing in the late 90s, selling it to everyone, destroying everything, laughing
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:00:58.120]  at us.
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:02.960]  They're so full of arrogance, and they're now got a Supreme Court nominee who says ban
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:07.200]  free speech and writes public papers on it, I mean, she shouldn't be able to be a county
[03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:12.600]  judge, much less a toilet attendant, and they're just driving forward.
[03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:16.520]  I don't see how they could be successful, I mean, I see it as good news that Sarkozy's
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:20.640]  barely hanging on in France, that Merkel's barely hanging on, that even though new puppets
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:26.920]  are coming in like shark teeth behind her, that this is a sign, look at Gordon Brown.
[03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:34.320]  So, clearly, this is very unpopular, it's illegal, and the last four minutes, not what
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:38.520]  you want to happen, and we had you on about your great political ideas and economic ideas,
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:43.640]  but what you think is happening, I mean, how do you see this playing out looking further?
[03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:47.520]  You know, two, three years from now, not what you want to happen, but where do you think
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:49.280]  will be three years from now?
[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:55.880]  Well, again, I believe in human liberty, and I believe in redemption, so I'd have to factor
[03:01:55.880 --> 03:01:56.880]  that in.
[03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:02.480]  But in terms of the Depression, in the previous Depression, you had three waves, it would
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:06.880]  have had more, but it came to an end in various countries.
[03:02:06.880 --> 03:02:12.240]  You had the crash of October 1929 is the first wave, then a year and a half later, you have
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:18.640]  the collapse of Europe, starts in Austria, Germany, Hungary, Central Europe, then Britain,
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:23.920]  so Europe is absolutely destroyed in the summer of 1931.
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:32.960]  Then in June, say, of 1932, you get the panic in the banks of Chicago and Illinois, and
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:38.600]  then rapidly it goes through various state banking systems through Nevada, through Louisiana,
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:44.120]  despite the efforts of Huey Long, through Michigan, despite the efforts of Henry Ford,
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:49.520]  and by the last day of Hoover, every bank in the United States had shut down, and if
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:54.480]  they hadn't had a bank holiday on that following Monday, they would have all been bankrupt.
[03:02:54.480 --> 03:02:59.760]  It would have had an absolutely chaotic, calamitous situation.
[03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:03.000]  So we're now in the beginning of the second wave.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:07.920]  We're basically back here in May, June of 1931.
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:13.120]  So we see what we're headed towards now, unless policies are radically changed, and
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:14.120]  that we can stay.
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:17.840]  If you don't change your policy radically, you're going to have the chaotic breakup
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:23.320]  of the euro, the chaotic breakup of the European Central Bank, the British pound will be pulled
[03:03:23.320 --> 03:03:25.840]  into it, and the euro-dollar market.
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:31.440]  Now, I think that the gap, the time lapse between the second wave and the third wave
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:33.960]  now is likely to be very quick.
[03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:40.040]  In other words, it's not going to take six months for the crisis to come back here,
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:44.960]  and therefore, panic runs on the dollar, panic runs on the Federal Reserve.
[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:50.440]  Everyone might constitute some kind of an interlude because of their huge debt, but also again
[03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:51.440]  because they can't...
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:53.560]  So are you talking about a year or six months?
[03:03:53.560 --> 03:03:56.880]  I think you're talking about less than a year, but this is very hard to say.
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:00.960]  I think the more important is the order of events, so you'll know where you are, not
[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:02.960]  by the calendar, but by what's happening.
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:03.960]  Look.
[03:04:03.960 --> 03:04:07.120]  And we'll have the media, because we're almost out of time, will be telling us that we're
[03:04:07.120 --> 03:04:11.440]  in milk and honey when 100 million Americans are on food stamps, not 40 million.
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:14.120]  Look, there were panic runs on the Federal Reserve.
[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:19.120]  There was a panic run on the New York branch of the Federal Reserve in the spring of 1933.
[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:23.800]  There was a panic run on the Bank of International Settlements in the spring of 1933.
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:28.560]  So when you get into the third wave, which is also disintegration, disintegration of national
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:33.600]  banking systems, you also got these institutions going down.
[03:04:33.600 --> 03:04:39.440]  Ultimately, a panic run on the International Monetary Fund, if the IMF lends out 300 billion
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:44.720]  euros, 400 billion dollars, then that sets them up for bankruptcy and panic.
[03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:45.720]  All right, Webster, we're out of time.
[03:04:45.720 --> 03:04:46.720]  We're out of fall-down.
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:52.240]  And of course, the ace in the hole is, they're going to start a war with Iran to smoke screen
[03:04:52.240 --> 03:04:54.680]  this probably in the next year.
[03:04:54.680 --> 03:04:56.200]  Possibly, yes.
[03:04:56.200 --> 03:04:59.360]  That becomes more likely as they're hysteria and desperation.
[03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:00.360]  Yes.
[03:05:00.360 --> 03:05:01.360]  Good job, Webster.
[03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:05.160]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:05:05.160 --> 03:05:10.160]  This documentary is here.
[03:05:10.160 --> 03:05:13.160]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:05:13.160 --> 03:05:15.160]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:20.160]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[03:05:20.160 --> 03:05:21.160]  on Earth.
[03:05:21.160 --> 03:05:26.160]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being
[03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:28.160]  expanded nationwide.
[03:05:28.160 --> 03:05:32.160]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[03:05:32.160 --> 03:05:34.160]  powerful shadow state.
[03:05:34.160 --> 03:05:35.160]  The public has fallen.
[03:05:35.160 --> 03:05:39.160]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:05:39.160 --> 03:05:45.160]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:05:45.160 --> 03:05:49.160]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:05:49.160 --> 03:05:51.160]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:05:51.160 --> 03:05:52.160]  It's here.

[03:05:59.160 --> 03:06:06.160]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high volume pre-production
[03:06:06.160 --> 03:06:08.160]  order of the new quick fix meals.
[03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:12.160]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive
[03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:15.160]  one free item for every three that they bought.
[03:06:15.160 --> 03:06:19.160]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three get one free program, we've had a lot of folks
[03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:22.160]  calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[03:06:22.160 --> 03:06:23.160]  Listen carefully.
[03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:29.160]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three
[03:06:29.160 --> 03:06:33.160]  get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.

[03:08:03.160 --> 03:08:10.160]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:10.160 --> 03:08:15.160]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:08:15.160 --> 03:08:22.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not just at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:25.160]  We have her quotes, the white paper she's written.
[03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:26.160]  It's on CNN.
[03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:27.160]  It's on MSNBC.
[03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:32.160]  That's coming up before this broadcast ends in 52 minutes.
[03:08:32.160 --> 03:08:38.160]  Kagan, the new Supreme Court nominee, a minion of Larry Summers, a Goldman Sachs employee,
[03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:43.160]  the Harvard minion, is for banning free speech.
[03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:47.160]  The White House regulations are cast.
[03:08:47.160 --> 03:08:53.160]  Sunstein, of course, wrote Harvard and Chicago Law School papers two years ago calling for
[03:08:53.160 --> 03:09:00.160]  arresting anyone who doesn't believe in man-made global warming, anthropogenic global warming.
[03:09:00.160 --> 03:09:03.160]  They have such giant definitions of what should be illegal.
[03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:08.160]  He said people that say sunlight is good for you, though most doctors say you need some
[03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:12.160]  of it, that will be banned because it's dangerous.
[03:09:12.160 --> 03:09:15.160]  The feds are going to tell you what you can feed your kids.
[03:09:15.160 --> 03:09:19.160]  The federal government's ordered the state of Texas to kick kids out and the second time
[03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:20.160]  arrest them.
[03:09:20.160 --> 03:09:26.160]  If they have one Jolly Rancher in their lunchbox, you can't draw an American flag.
[03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:28.160]  A girl got in trouble for that.
[03:09:28.160 --> 03:09:30.160]  Can't have an American flag shirt.
[03:09:30.160 --> 03:09:32.160]  Laptops are watching kids at home.
[03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:34.160]  Government-issued laptops.
[03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:41.160]  The court's saying you're allowed to take 56,000 photos of kids at home without them knowing.
[03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:47.160]  Kagan, disappear free speech if the government deems it offensive, if it hurts someone's
[03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:48.160]  feelings.
[03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:50.160]  Here's another one.
[03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:55.160]  Law would empower Hillary Clinton to revoke citizenship of whoever she deems to be a terrorist.
[03:09:55.160 --> 03:09:56.160]  No judge, no jury.
[03:09:56.160 --> 03:09:59.160]  And that, of course, here's raw story.
[03:09:59.160 --> 03:10:00.160]  The liberals even admit this.
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:05.160]  Kagan supported detaining terrorist suspects, including American citizens indefinitely without
[03:10:05.160 --> 03:10:06.160]  trial.
[03:10:06.160 --> 03:10:10.160]  Paul Joseph Watson, dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:12.160]  This bill's working its way through.
[03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:18.160]  Last week, with McCain and Lieberman, the headlines, U.S. citizens to be stripped.
[03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:19.160]  No judge, no jury.
[03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:21.160]  The Pentagon just grabs you.
[03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:23.160]  We're going to be talking about this.
[03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:26.160]  We're going to be talking about states' rights, what's happening.
[03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:33.160]  But the fact that government is coming out in the open and behaving like this, people thought
[03:10:33.160 --> 03:10:37.160]  Bush was bad with the Patriot Act that Obama's expanded or secret arrest and torture and illegal
[03:10:37.160 --> 03:10:38.160]  wars, and he was bad.
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:39.160]  He was a puppet.
[03:10:39.160 --> 03:10:40.160]  So was Obama.
[03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:43.160]  And the Republicans that come in will be just as bad or worse.
[03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:46.160]  It's just progression into tyranny.
[03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:49.160]  We're going to talk about this and so many other subjects.
[03:10:49.160 --> 03:10:55.160]  We've also gotten a new state of Texas census form that they're making kids fill out that
[03:10:55.160 --> 03:10:59.160]  is so intrusive, and the federal government's pushing this, training the kids to answer
[03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:00.160]  government questions.
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:03.160]  That's coming up in the shower.
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:07.160]  Michael Bagnarek is an American software engineer, political figure, and former radio talk show
[03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:08.160]  host.
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:12.160]  He's a libertarian presidential nominee for president of the United States in 2004 and
[03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:15.160]  placed fourth in the nation behind independent Ralph Nader.
[03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:19.160]  Two years later, he ran as a libertarian party candidate in 2006 congressional elections
[03:11:19.160 --> 03:11:21.160]  for Texas 10th congressional district.
[03:11:21.160 --> 03:11:23.160]  Got a lot of votes in Austin.
[03:11:23.160 --> 03:11:29.160]  And he is a great libertarian, a former Austinite, fellow Texan, good friend of mine.
[03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:30.160]  He almost died of an heart attack.
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:34.160]  In fact, if memory serves, I believe he did die for a while and had to be resuscitated.
[03:11:34.160 --> 03:11:39.160]  And he joins us via video Skype from his home in Texas.
[03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:41.160]  It is good to have you here with us.
[03:11:41.160 --> 03:11:42.160]  Michael Bagnarek.
[03:11:42.160 --> 03:11:43.160]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[03:11:43.160 --> 03:11:47.160]  I was only dead for 10 minutes, so it really wasn't that big of a thing.
[03:11:47.160 --> 03:11:50.160]  Too much, too much liberty to help fight for.
[03:11:50.160 --> 03:11:52.160]  So I was just too stubborn to die.
[03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:53.160]  How are you feeling?
[03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:55.160]  I feel absolutely great.
[03:11:55.160 --> 03:11:56.160]  I went home for Mother's Day.
[03:11:56.160 --> 03:11:58.160]  Mom said that I've got my color back.
[03:11:58.160 --> 03:11:59.160]  I've gained weight.
[03:11:59.160 --> 03:12:03.160]  Mom was real happy with my appearance and my health.
[03:12:03.160 --> 03:12:09.160]  I've been feeling great since I returned to Texas in early February.
[03:12:09.160 --> 03:12:12.160]  Well, Michael, there's so much to talk about, so much to discuss.
[03:12:12.160 --> 03:12:17.160]  I want to get into the central banks, derivatives, the Federal Reserve, all those things that you've railed against.
[03:12:17.160 --> 03:12:31.160]  But first, this information with the new Supreme Court nominee with public statements and white papers calling for the end of the Second Amendment, arrest whoever they want, legislation racing through to do it.
[03:12:31.160 --> 03:12:35.160]  I mean, this is mousey tongue level.
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:37.160]  It is terrifying.
[03:12:37.160 --> 03:12:40.160]  I travel a lot, and I don't have much time to watch television.
[03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:48.160]  I only found out that we had a new nominee for the Supreme Court when I was at the bus station waiting for the bus to arrive.
[03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:58.160]  And it is terrifying the way they are stacking the Supreme Court with people who don't recognize the difference between rights and privileges.
[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:14.160]  Well, I mean, as a constitutional scholar who, you know, packs hotel ballrooms with seminars on the Constitution, break down the constitutional violations when you have a government with legislation openly saying we can keep you safe,
[03:13:14.160 --> 03:13:22.160]  but we need to be able to secretly arrest citizens with no trial and strip them of their citizenship and give them enhanced interrogation, i.e. torture.
[03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:27.160]  Well, the quickest way to do this is to ask why we have any government at all.
[03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:31.160]  Do we want complete lack of government, anarchy?
[03:13:31.160 --> 03:13:33.160]  Well, most people don't want that.
[03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:37.160]  So why would the Founding Fathers create any government at all?
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:46.160]  Well, to protect the life, liberty, and private property that we already had, any government that's going to be legitimate is going to protect your property.
[03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:53.160]  Any government that is violating your life, liberty, or property is illegitimate.
[03:13:53.160 --> 03:13:57.160]  The purpose of the Constitution was to establish limitations on government power.
[03:13:57.160 --> 03:14:05.160]  And, yeah, the government is bad, but the Americans who live here need to understand the difference between rights and privileges.
[03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:08.160]  They need to understand the Constitution.
[03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:14.160]  They need to understand that we are the source of all political power and that the government works for us.
[03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:19.160]  Anywhere I happen to be standing is a free speech zone.
[03:14:19.160 --> 03:14:23.160]  We don't have free speech zones in the United States. This is ridiculous.
[03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:37.160]  And any Supreme Court justice that is written to violate or limit your freedom of speech is certainly not a constitutionalist and should never be on the Supreme Court.
[03:14:37.160 --> 03:14:49.160]  Michael Bagnaric is also with us because it is going to be released and start shipping on the 17th. So coming up on Monday, and we just got these in, don't tread on me.
[03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:56.160]  Rise of the Republic, Michael Bagnaric, Alex Jones, Evan Vieira, Cynthia Davis, Charles Key, and many, many others.
[03:14:56.160 --> 03:14:58.160]  And this film needed to be made.
[03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:10.160]  I'm glad that the makers of Camp FEMA and Washington You're Fired and Wall Street Life on the Edge of a Bubble have made this documentary because it explains the difference between a republic and a democracy.
[03:15:10.160 --> 03:15:16.160]  States' rights, 9th to 10th Amendment, and has a blueprint to take our nation back.
[03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:22.160]  People need to see this because it's basically a constitution class in and of itself in this two-hour film.
[03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:29.160]  Michael, you're a big part of this. People can pre-order it. It's basically an order now because it'll be shipping out early next week to everyone.
[03:15:29.160 --> 03:15:36.160]  We have these here at infowars.com where folks can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:15:36.160 --> 03:15:42.160]  I'm excited that so many great films are coming out to educate and inform because people are now ready to be awakened.
[03:15:42.160 --> 03:15:45.160]  We've just got to do the next step and get this into their hands.
[03:15:45.160 --> 03:15:53.160]  I hope folks will order this film, and we just lost the video Skype connection to him for a second.
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:16:01.160]  For Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, again available at infowars.com, and it's going to be shipping out next week.
[03:16:01.160 --> 03:16:05.160]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:16:05.160 --> 03:16:19.160]  Michael Bagnaric, talk about the difference between a republic and a democracy, Ninth, Tenth Amendment, and versus this federal government itself captured by foreign corporate interest.
[03:16:19.160 --> 03:16:27.160]  The difference between a democracy and a republic, a democracy, everybody knows, majority wins.
[03:16:27.160 --> 03:16:37.160]  But what they leave out is that the minority loses. 51% of the people can vote away the property or the liberty of the 49%.
[03:16:37.160 --> 03:16:43.160]  I spoke at a college in Rhode Island. One girl asked me, don't you think guns are dangerous?
[03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:49.160]  I said, no, ma'am, I don't. She goes, well, couldn't we vote to take your guns away from you?
[03:16:49.160 --> 03:17:01.160]  And I said, absolutely. You can vote that Michael is crazy and dangerous, and you can have a unanimous vote to take my guns away, but then you have to have another vote to see which one of you is going to take them.
[03:17:01.160 --> 03:17:06.160]  My rights are not predicated on your being comfortable with it.
[03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:15.160]  So in a democracy, you can vote on anything. You can vote to take somebody else's property away. You can vote to limit somebody else's freedom of speech.
[03:17:15.160 --> 03:17:22.160]  We live in a republic. I pledge allegiance to the flag and to the republic for which it stands.
[03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:31.160]  A republic is based on law. One person and the right of private property will supersede a unanimous vote.
[03:17:31.160 --> 03:17:39.160]  In a republic, the minority is protected from an overbearing majority.
[03:17:39.160 --> 03:17:45.160]  So the major difference for you to know is that in a democracy, you can vote on anything.
[03:17:45.160 --> 03:17:50.160]  And in a republic, there are many, many things that you're not allowed to vote on.
[03:17:50.160 --> 03:17:56.160]  Now, the ninth and tenth amendments are very important. They actually work together.
[03:17:56.160 --> 03:18:04.160]  The ninth amendment, without repeating it, says that because we have a bill of rights, that's not a complete list.
[03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:12.160]  The bill of rights doesn't say anything about your right to have children, but you clearly have a right to have children.
[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:19.160]  The bill of rights says nothing about your right to travel, but you have a right to travel.
[03:18:19.160 --> 03:18:25.160]  So the ninth amendment explicitly says that the bill of rights is not a comprehensive list.
[03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:31.160]  There are things that you can do by right which are not listed in the bill of rights.
[03:18:31.160 --> 03:18:44.160]  On the contrary, the tenth amendment explicitly says that the government is not allowed to do things unless the Constitution explicitly allows it.
[03:18:44.160 --> 03:18:54.160]  We the people have rights, we give the government privileges, and those privileges for the government are listed in Article 1, Section 8.
[03:18:54.160 --> 03:19:03.160]  Anything that the government is doing not explicitly listed in Article 1, Section 8 is by definition unconstitutional.
[03:19:03.160 --> 03:19:11.160]  And all powers that are not listed in the tenth amendment, there's only three of them, are reserved to the states or the people.
[03:19:11.160 --> 03:19:17.160]  And the ninth amendment, as you said, clearly states, you know, every common right of a free creature.
[03:19:17.160 --> 03:19:20.160]  We've got it all, and the federal government can't touch it.
[03:19:20.160 --> 03:19:27.160]  Now the feds are saying they want to push a one-child policy here because it's not expressly enumerated.
[03:19:27.160 --> 03:19:33.160]  But when it is enumerated under the first amendment, how can you have someone who's going to be the Supreme Court Justice say,
[03:19:33.160 --> 03:19:36.160]  I'm going to arrest you for your speech?
[03:19:36.160 --> 03:19:38.160]  What a piece of trash.
[03:19:38.160 --> 03:19:39.160]  What a tyrant.
[03:19:39.160 --> 03:19:42.160]  What an enemy of anyone that loves freedom.
[03:19:42.160 --> 03:19:45.160]  Michael Wagner, a big part of the new film.
[03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:46.160]  Don't tread on me.
[03:19:46.160 --> 03:19:48.160]  Get it first at infowars.com.
[03:19:48.160 --> 03:19:52.160]  We've got it about this film from William Lewis and Gary Franchi.
[03:19:52.160 --> 03:19:56.160]  We'll be back on the other side of this quick break with Michael Badnarik.
[03:19:56.160 --> 03:19:58.160]  Today we've covered so much news.
[03:19:58.160 --> 03:20:00.160]  We haven't even taken any calls yet.
[03:20:00.160 --> 03:20:02.160]  We will take calls for Michael. Stay with us.
[03:20:02.160 --> 03:20:06.160]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:20:06.160 --> 03:20:07.160]  Tyranny is here.
[03:20:07.160 --> 03:20:11.160]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:20:11.160 --> 03:20:13.160]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:19.160]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[03:20:19.160 --> 03:20:25.160]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:31.160]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[03:20:31.160 --> 03:20:35.160]  Police State Four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:20:35.160 --> 03:20:40.160]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:20:40.160 --> 03:20:46.160]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:20:46.160 --> 03:20:49.160]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:20:49.160 --> 03:20:52.160]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[03:22:01.160 --> 03:22:02.160]  Gold isn't for you.
[03:22:02.160 --> 03:22:04.160]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources.
[03:22:04.160 --> 03:22:07.160]  One of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:22:07.160 --> 03:22:08.160]  I get it.
[03:22:08.160 --> 03:22:12.160]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job,
[03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:16.160]  that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy,
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:18.160]  that social security would be there for you.
[03:22:18.160 --> 03:22:19.160]  That's not what's happening.
[03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:24.160]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[03:22:24.160 --> 03:22:28.160]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:22:28.160 --> 03:22:31.160]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:22:31.160 --> 03:22:35.160]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:22:35.160 --> 03:22:41.160]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:22:41.160 --> 03:22:45.160]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:22:45.160 --> 03:22:46.160]  You should, too.
[03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:47.160]  Find out what they know.
[03:22:47.160 --> 03:22:50.160]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.
[03:22:50.160 --> 03:22:51.160]  Free.
[03:22:51.160 --> 03:22:53.160]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:56.160]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:56.160 --> 03:22:59.160]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.160 --> 03:23:05.160]  In March, Alex Jones announced that E-Foods Direct was putting together a high-volume
[03:23:05.160 --> 03:23:08.160]  pre-production order of the new quick-fix meals
[03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:11.160]  by waiting for production and shipping of their orders.
[03:23:11.160 --> 03:23:16.160]  Families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[03:23:16.160 --> 03:23:19.160]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three get one free program,
[03:23:19.160 --> 03:23:23.160]  we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:24.160]  Listen carefully.
[03:23:24.160 --> 03:23:29.160]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three
[03:23:29.160 --> 03:23:34.160]  get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:38.160]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:41.160]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[03:23:41.160 --> 03:23:48.160]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash GCN or call 800-409-5633.
[03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:54.160]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash GCN 800-409-5633.
[03:23:54.160 --> 03:24:04.160]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash GCN 800-409-5633.
[03:24:25.160 --> 03:24:34.160]  Coming up, Texas school demands students submit to intrusive census form.
[03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:36.160]  There's no law to do that.
[03:24:36.160 --> 03:24:41.160]  All the feds can do to enumerate how many representatives you get from your state
[03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:45.160]  is ask you every ten years how many people live in this house.
[03:24:45.160 --> 03:24:46.160]  That's it.
[03:24:46.160 --> 03:24:50.160]  Again, there's a bunch of different versions of the forms, at least four different ones.
[03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:54.160]  One's only 20-something questions, one's 40-plus.
[03:24:54.160 --> 03:24:55.160]  We've gone over the forms here.
[03:24:55.160 --> 03:24:58.160]  You can go to the census website and read it.
[03:24:58.160 --> 03:25:00.160]  But they ask, do you own guns?
[03:25:00.160 --> 03:25:01.160]  What type of toilet do you have?
[03:25:01.160 --> 03:25:02.160]  How many homes?
[03:25:02.160 --> 03:25:04.160]  I mean, how many rooms in your house?
[03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:05.160]  Do you have heating?
[03:25:05.160 --> 03:25:09.160]  And they're asking the kids this stuff for CPS and other reasons.
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:10.160]  This is scary.
[03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:11.160]  That's coming up.
[03:25:11.160 --> 03:25:13.160]  Going back to Michael Bagnering.
[03:25:13.160 --> 03:25:17.160]  Michael, we see the public waking up.
[03:25:17.160 --> 03:25:22.160]  When you came forth in the presidential election as a Libertarian Party candidate in 2004,
[03:25:22.160 --> 03:25:24.160]  people were starting to wake up, but not like they are now.
[03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:27.160]  Are you seeing the same awakening I'm seeing?
[03:25:27.160 --> 03:25:33.160]  Are you concerned about the attempt to demonize any type of Tea Party or Tenth Amendment,
[03:25:33.160 --> 03:25:37.160]  Ninth Amendment, states rights, nullification movement?
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:44.160]  I do see a huge increase in the number of people who are waking up.
[03:25:44.160 --> 03:25:50.160]  A lot of the people that I talk to tell me they've only woken up in the last year or so.
[03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:55.160]  So we have the Tea Party, the Campaign for Liberty, the 9-12 groups.
[03:25:55.160 --> 03:26:00.160]  All of these different groups are starting to gather people.
[03:26:00.160 --> 03:26:02.160]  And this is an incredibly good thing.
[03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:06.160]  You and I have been telling people about this stuff for years.
[03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:12.160]  And I, for one, feel that they're finally starting to listen to us, Alex.
[03:26:12.160 --> 03:26:13.160]  That's a good thing.
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:18.160]  As far as, do I worry about the mainstream media demonizing us?
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:23.160]  No, I really don't worry about it because I know it's not going to stop you and I.
[03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:29.160]  But I think that when your ordinary average person goes to a Tea Party rally
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:34.160]  and they find out on the news that they're a radical extremist, they're a racist,
[03:26:34.160 --> 03:26:37.160]  they're going to realize that that's not true.
[03:26:37.160 --> 03:26:42.160]  And they're going to draw the conclusion that most of what the media has been telling us
[03:26:42.160 --> 03:26:44.160]  has been a lie for all these years.
[03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:51.160]  So it is a little bit irritating, but I think that having the mainstream media bad mouth us
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:54.160]  is really a good thing in the long run.
[03:26:54.160 --> 03:26:55.160]  Well, I agree with you.
[03:26:55.160 --> 03:27:00.160]  They still think that they have air superiority, basically, and no one can challenge them.
[03:27:00.160 --> 03:27:05.160]  But when they lie and distort and twist, they're only losing what little bit of credibility
[03:27:05.160 --> 03:27:09.160]  they may have had left, and that's why you see all their numbers plunging.
[03:27:09.160 --> 03:27:12.160]  It's not just people converting over to the Internet. That's happening as well.
[03:27:12.160 --> 03:27:19.160]  But they've done national studies at the Population Trust alternative media, 2 to 1,
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:22.160]  with the amount of trust they give mainstream media.
[03:27:22.160 --> 03:27:25.160]  And mainstream media is now admitting they're getting federal funds
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:29.160]  for what they call behavior placement or brainwashing.
[03:27:29.160 --> 03:27:33.160]  Well, this is just the start.
[03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:38.160]  This is just the start with the things that you were talking about at the top of the hour.
[03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:44.160]  Webster Tarpley is telling us that it's six months to a year.
[03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:50.160]  The number of people who are coming over to Internet media and to support the Constitution
[03:27:50.160 --> 03:27:54.160]  and Liberty is going to grow exponentially.
[03:27:54.160 --> 03:27:57.160]  We're beyond the tipping point.
[03:27:57.160 --> 03:28:03.160]  And at this point in time, it's a downhill slide and things are just going to keep on picking up speed.
[03:28:03.160 --> 03:28:08.160]  It's going to be interesting. Not everybody's going to be able to hold on to the toboggan,
[03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:14.160]  but we are pointed in the direction of Liberty, and we're starting to increase our speed.
[03:28:14.160 --> 03:28:18.160]  There's a host of issues I want to go over with you, but when we come back,
[03:28:18.160 --> 03:28:23.160]  I want to get into the census. They're sending out census forms through the schools
[03:28:23.160 --> 03:28:29.160]  for kids to fill out with no congressional authority behind it.
[03:28:29.160 --> 03:28:34.160]  Briefly, what is the census and what role is it constitutional?
[03:28:34.160 --> 03:28:45.160]  Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 says that our representatives and direct taxes are determined by population.
[03:28:45.160 --> 03:28:52.160]  And in that same clause, it explains that the census must happen every 10 years.
[03:28:52.160 --> 03:28:57.160]  So the census is mandated by the Constitution. That part is true.
[03:28:57.160 --> 03:29:05.160]  As you said a few moments ago, the only thing they can ask is how many people live in your house.
[03:29:05.160 --> 03:29:14.160]  Now, frankly, it's in your best interest to answer that part of the census so that we get accurate representation.
[03:29:14.160 --> 03:29:20.160]  But as I told a census worker, what difference does it make if the Republicans and Democrats in office,
[03:29:20.160 --> 03:29:26.160]  in Congress, are passing the Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, the Homegrown Terrorist Act,
[03:29:26.160 --> 03:29:31.160]  then they're not really representing us.
[03:29:31.160 --> 03:29:35.160]  Absolutely. Michael McNerrick is our guest. He's a big part of the new film.
[03:29:35.160 --> 03:29:42.160]  Don't tread on me. Rise of the Republic. Start shipping out on Monday from infowars.com.
[03:29:42.160 --> 03:29:48.160]  Such a powerful film covers all of these subjects available at infowars.com.
[03:29:48.160 --> 03:29:51.160]  Michael McNerrick is our guest. Your phone calls in a lot more straight ahead.
[03:29:51.160 --> 03:30:00.160]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.160 --> 03:30:05.160]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order.
[03:30:05.160 --> 03:30:08.160]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:13.160]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:30:13.160 --> 03:30:18.160]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:30:18.160 --> 03:30:21.160]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:30:21.160 --> 03:30:26.160]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[03:30:26.160 --> 03:30:32.160]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:30:32.160 --> 03:30:34.160]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:30:34.160 --> 03:30:40.160]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:30:40.160 --> 03:30:43.160]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:30:43.160 --> 03:30:49.160]  It's going to be an inner, ruling elite, and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[03:32:00.160 --> 03:32:07.160]  Hi, everyone. Andy Anderson here. Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[03:32:07.160 --> 03:32:13.160]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:13.160 --> 03:32:17.160]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[03:32:17.160 --> 03:32:19.160]  No more protection till you use it again.
[03:32:19.160 --> 03:32:25.160]  PureWorks to the rescue. Our FDA compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.

[03:32:58.160 --> 03:33:01.160]  That's 888-245-0300.
[03:33:13.160 --> 03:33:17.160]  I'm going to do a YouTube video when I get off air today.
[03:33:17.160 --> 03:33:24.160]  You know, we've talked about how the Ford Foundation and the government are trying to fund white supremacists,
[03:33:24.160 --> 03:33:29.160]  Mexican supremacist groups, black supremacist groups, so that we don't become Americans
[03:33:29.160 --> 03:33:34.160]  and love the Bill of Rights and Constitution and private property and freedom and the Second Amendment.
[03:33:34.160 --> 03:33:37.160]  No. So that we all just fight with each other over race.
[03:33:37.160 --> 03:33:43.160]  And I'm really concerned about Robert Rodriguez's new film, Machete, because the trailer came out and looked like race war to me
[03:33:43.160 --> 03:33:49.160]  and the white guys are the bad guys and Robert De Niro's in it and Jessica Alba and all these people I've been fans of
[03:33:49.160 --> 03:33:52.160]  and I've liked Robert Rodriguez, fellow Austinite.
[03:33:52.160 --> 03:33:59.160]  Well, I was contacted by members of his crew who are Hispanic who are concerned that it's going to have a backlash against Hispanics.
[03:33:59.160 --> 03:34:04.160]  And now I've been sent the script.
[03:34:04.160 --> 03:34:10.160]  And here's the script from Machete by Robert Rodriguez and it's worse than I even thought.
[03:34:10.160 --> 03:34:15.160]  So for raw story and others that admit they haven't even seen the trailer and are making fun of us,
[03:34:15.160 --> 03:34:18.160]  you're not I guess you'll laugh at this too.
[03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:21.160]  The Minutemen are all hacked up and killed with machetes.
[03:34:21.160 --> 03:34:23.160]  White people are the bad guys.
[03:34:23.160 --> 03:34:30.160]  The only good part about this film is a senator stages a terror attack against himself as a pretext to go after Hispanics.
[03:34:30.160 --> 03:34:33.160]  So I guess Robert Rodriguez has been given my films.
[03:34:33.160 --> 03:34:35.160]  I've been told I guess he woke up to something here.
[03:34:35.160 --> 03:34:40.160]  It's just horrible and it's just it's just disgusting.
[03:34:40.160 --> 03:34:44.160]  Now we're going back to Michael Bagnaric and then your phone calls.
[03:34:44.160 --> 03:34:52.160]  But I wanted to go back to Kagan, disappear free speech of the government, deems it offensive.
[03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:59.160]  Here's another one law would empower Hillary to revoke citizenship of whoever she deems terrorist that that's citizens.
[03:34:59.160 --> 03:35:04.160]  And this World War II law was what was used for Italian and Japanese Americans.
[03:35:04.160 --> 03:35:08.160]  This is why they grabbed hundreds of thousands of Japanese and put them in forced labor camps.
[03:35:08.160 --> 03:35:14.160]  People who've been here for a hundred plus years on their own seafood companies, their own manufacturing plants, Japanese doctors,
[03:35:14.160 --> 03:35:16.160]  total Americans.
[03:35:16.160 --> 03:35:21.160]  Well, they're now saying, oh, Adam Goodon is the grandson of one of the ADL board members totally staged folks.
[03:35:21.160 --> 03:35:25.160]  They've uploaded videos in the Intel Center's own logo with Alcada.
[03:35:25.160 --> 03:35:26.160]  It's all fake.
[03:35:26.160 --> 03:35:28.160]  This guy's an operative to sell us this idea.
[03:35:28.160 --> 03:35:31.160]  I want to play this and get Michael Bagnaric's take on that.
[03:35:31.160 --> 03:35:35.160]  They don't want to go over this Texas census form and then your phone calls.
[03:35:35.160 --> 03:35:38.160]  But here is the CNN propaganda piece.
[03:35:38.160 --> 03:35:42.160]  Well, they just report it calmly and nicely like it's going to keep you safe.
[03:35:42.160 --> 03:35:44.160]  We have to do this.
[03:35:44.160 --> 03:35:47.160]  We have to just correct the entire habeas corpus.
[03:35:47.160 --> 03:35:52.160]  It's in the belligerence act racing through the Senate where you just disappear.
[03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:53.160]  Bag goes over your head.
[03:35:53.160 --> 03:35:54.160]  You're gone.
[03:35:54.160 --> 03:35:55.160]  Here it is.
[03:35:55.160 --> 03:36:00.160]  California born Adam Goodon in an Alcada recruiting video.
[03:36:00.160 --> 03:36:04.160]  I will now proceed to destroy my American passport.
[03:36:04.160 --> 03:36:10.160]  But the Alcada operative on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list is still a U.S. citizen.
[03:36:10.160 --> 03:36:22.160]  If we captured Goodon today, he could make a claim as an American citizen to be tried in a federal district court with all the rights of citizenship.
[03:36:22.160 --> 03:36:33.160]  This bipartisan group wants to change that with legislation revoking the citizenship of Americans, the State Department deems aligned with foreign terrorist organizations.
[03:36:33.160 --> 03:36:37.160]  Now what it actually does, and we've read the bill on air, we printed it out and showed it to you.
[03:36:37.160 --> 03:36:39.160]  You can go read it.
[03:36:39.160 --> 03:36:46.160]  In fact, I'll give you the headline here from the article that Paul Watson wrote.
[03:36:46.160 --> 03:36:49.160]  Two months ago we warned you, three months ago actually.
[03:36:49.160 --> 03:36:52.160]  You can go read it for yourself.
[03:36:52.160 --> 03:36:59.160]  Decenters to be detained as enemy belligerents March 8th, 2010, as it was two months ago.
[03:36:59.160 --> 03:37:02.160]  And you can read it subsection, but no, no, no.
[03:37:02.160 --> 03:37:04.160]  They're not going to just say you're not a citizen.
[03:37:04.160 --> 03:37:07.160]  You're not going to get any new process under any law.
[03:37:07.160 --> 03:37:12.160]  Look how they're ordering Hitari released and the feds have tried to strip them because it was all made up.
[03:37:12.160 --> 03:37:14.160]  They didn't threaten anything.
[03:37:14.160 --> 03:37:18.160]  They just said if the government attaches, we'll have to defend ourselves.
[03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:22.160]  Let's finish the clip and get back, Narik, as a constitutional scholar's take on it.
[03:37:22.160 --> 03:37:27.160]  By the way, it's websites, constitutionpreservation.org, constitutionpreservation.org.
[03:37:27.160 --> 03:37:28.160]  Let's finish the clip.
[03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:36.160]  If they've been identified through their actions or specific statements that they no longer want to be a United States citizen as well by Golly, let's help them.
[03:37:36.160 --> 03:37:41.160]  The bill would update a little-known World War II era law still on the books,
[03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:47.160]  allowing the Secretary of State to revoke citizenship of Americans supporting foreign armies or states.
[03:37:47.160 --> 03:37:54.160]  Authors say their goal is not only to strip Americans like Adam Gadot of legal rights as U.S. citizens,
[03:37:54.160 --> 03:37:59.160]  but to thwart an al-Qaeda strategy to train Americans with U.S. passports.
[03:37:59.160 --> 03:38:10.160]  To recruit American citizens who can train overseas and then use their American passports to re-enter our country for the purpose of planning and carrying out.
[03:38:10.160 --> 03:38:13.160]  If they knew they were a terrorist, you'd just arrest them.
[03:38:13.160 --> 03:38:18.160]  I mean, this is insane. Again, and what does Kagan say?
[03:38:18.160 --> 03:38:21.160]  It's your free speech. They want to arrest you.
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:23.160]  We have the Homeland Security Mike reports.
[03:38:23.160 --> 03:38:25.160]  It's for veterans, returning veterans, gun owners.
[03:38:25.160 --> 03:38:26.160]  Continue.
[03:38:26.160 --> 03:38:29.160]  Attacks against us.
[03:38:29.160 --> 03:38:33.160]  Senator Joe Lieberman insists the bill is constitutional.
[03:38:33.160 --> 03:38:36.160]  Some legal experts disagree and call it dangerous.
[03:38:36.160 --> 03:38:43.160]  The government has such a broad understanding of what it means to provide material support to terrorism these days
[03:38:43.160 --> 03:38:51.160]  that really the most innocent benign activity could subject the most harmless Americans to this extreme sanction.
[03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:57.160]  They're already using the Patriot Act tens of thousands of times for family violence, marijuana, you name it.
[03:38:57.160 --> 03:39:04.160]  Michael Bagnarek, I mean, they think we're so ignorant. Is this not 100% the opposite of our Republic?
[03:39:04.160 --> 03:39:08.160]  Absolutely. 180 degrees out from what we want.
[03:39:08.160 --> 03:39:12.160]  People need to understand that we have individual rights.
[03:39:12.160 --> 03:39:21.160]  And I hate the phrase constitutional rights because people get the idea that the Constitution gives you your rights
[03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:25.160]  and therefore Joe Lieberman and his friends can take those rights away from you.
[03:39:25.160 --> 03:39:27.160]  Your rights are inherent.
[03:39:27.160 --> 03:39:32.160]  You had the right to life before they signed the Declaration of Independence.
[03:39:32.160 --> 03:39:37.160]  You had freedom of speech before they ratified the First Amendment.
[03:39:37.160 --> 03:39:46.160]  And by God, you have a right to defend your life whether or not anybody in Washington, D.C. reads and understands the Second Amendment.
[03:39:46.160 --> 03:39:49.160]  Your rights are inherent. They cannot be taken away from you.
[03:39:49.160 --> 03:39:52.160]  But you have to remember Thomas Jefferson's words.
[03:39:52.160 --> 03:39:55.160]  You only have the rights that you are willing to fight for.
[03:39:55.160 --> 03:40:02.160]  Well, let me add to that. Republican supported the Patriot Act, even though Section 802 says it's for the citizens.
[03:40:02.160 --> 03:40:05.160]  Now we receive from law enforcement. It's been big national news for a year and a half.
[03:40:05.160 --> 03:40:08.160]  The government documents that this is really for us.
[03:40:08.160 --> 03:40:12.160]  Now Homeland Security admits American citizens are the main terrorists they want to get.
[03:40:12.160 --> 03:40:14.160]  People that want to end the Fed, we're terrorists.
[03:40:14.160 --> 03:40:18.160]  Ron Paul's bad. We're all, you know, Oathkeepers are seditious. That's Mother Jones.
[03:40:18.160 --> 03:40:21.160]  Arrest us all.
[03:40:21.160 --> 03:40:26.160]  So now a lot of conservative groups, you know, have got the headline, Hillary can revoke your citizenship.
[03:40:26.160 --> 03:40:29.160]  And that's what they can do if they get this through.
[03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:36.160]  I mean, this is for us. Understand that Adam Gadon's a CIA operative just to cut out a goldstein to scare you.
[03:40:36.160 --> 03:40:42.160]  I had another question for you. It came in on an email ticket for Michael Bagnarek.
[03:40:42.160 --> 03:40:48.160]  It says, the 14th Amendment creates a second form of government, a citizen, and turns us into federal citizens.
[03:40:48.160 --> 03:40:57.160]  If we do not correct our status back to the state nationals, we can send to be under the jurisdiction of the usurper federal private government.
[03:40:57.160 --> 03:41:02.160]  Ask how he expects us to ignore the fact. So that's a question for you.
[03:41:02.160 --> 03:41:05.160]  I don't think you are ignoring this, but comment on it.
[03:41:05.160 --> 03:41:18.160]  Though I'm not ignoring it, and I actually mentioned this, I go over it during my Constitution class, but you have to understand that the government lies, cheats, steals, and murders.
[03:41:18.160 --> 03:41:23.160]  They are ignoring the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land.
[03:41:23.160 --> 03:41:29.160]  Sending them a certified letter is not going to change the way that they interact with you.
[03:41:29.160 --> 03:41:39.160]  I mean, you may be correct. I mean, legally and technically you may be correct, but the government is going to come and put a bag over your head and whisk you away anyway.
[03:41:39.160 --> 03:41:49.160]  So while I don't disagree with it, I think we've gone too far to try to fix this with the letters to the editor or voting.
[03:41:49.160 --> 03:41:58.160]  We need to get hundreds of thousands of people together to rally to demonstrate that we outnumber them by several orders of magnitude.
[03:41:58.160 --> 03:42:10.160]  And by the way, at the G20 last year, a lot of the peaceful protesters had bags put over their heads for hours, a form of deprivation, taking the power of sight away from you, trying to panic you so you're in the dark.
[03:42:10.160 --> 03:42:17.160]  All of these anti-terror weapons, microwave guns, torture, it's all now being used against us. They call it paying compliance.
[03:42:17.160 --> 03:42:32.160]  We have a rogue out of control government, and I just never get out. People send us emails accusing someone of covering something up when you can't cover the entire pantheon of reality in the world in a trillion hours, much less one.
[03:42:32.160 --> 03:42:38.160]  But I wanted to bring, I mean, we constantly talk about the fact that this made us all awards of the state and discuss it.
[03:42:38.160 --> 03:42:46.160]  All right, before we go to calls, I want to shift gears to another subject. In fact, give me a document cam for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, please, gentlemen, right here.
[03:42:46.160 --> 03:43:01.160]  The federal government I discovered back in 99, this is in my film, Police State to the Takeover, was putting deputized local sheriff's deputies under ATF control and having law enforcement semester classes in seventh, eighth, ninth grade, sometimes sixth grade,
[03:43:01.160 --> 03:43:08.160]  saying, what's in mommy's medicine cabinet? Do they smoke marijuana? Having them write dossiers on their parents training them to do this.
[03:43:08.160 --> 03:43:17.160]  And now we've got this from the state of Texas, and we went to their website, it's confirmed, the texasexperience.com page 63.
[03:43:17.160 --> 03:43:27.160]  And this came in in an email, we've confirmed that their child was given a zero because they refused to fill it out in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:34.160]  And it's just the feds ordering school kids. It says every 10 years, it's time for Texans to stand up and be counted.
[03:43:34.160 --> 03:43:40.160]  Since 1790, the United States has conducted a census of account of each of its citizens.
[03:43:40.160 --> 03:43:46.160]  Practice filling out the census form. It says, name, place of birth, current address, does your family owner rent where you live?
[03:43:46.160 --> 03:43:52.160]  How long have you lived in Texas? How many people are in your family? How many females? How many males? What are their ages?
[03:43:52.160 --> 03:43:58.160]  How many rooms are in your house? That's for CPS to see if there's too many people. Oh, we live in an apartment. Oh, you're at risk. Boom.
[03:43:58.160 --> 03:44:05.160]  And I've seen them take babies from people that are poor, just for being poor. How was your home heated? Oh, you don't know.
[03:44:05.160 --> 03:44:14.160]  How many cars is your family owned? How many telephones in your home? Is your home a farm?
[03:44:14.160 --> 03:44:23.160]  And, you know, this is just incredible. And it even says, sounds pretty nosy, doesn't it? But a census is very important.
[03:44:23.160 --> 03:44:31.160]  This information is used for all kinds of purposes. So they're training the kids. I mean, this is, once they set the precedent to make them answer questions, the sky's the limit.
[03:44:31.160 --> 03:44:41.160]  Michael Bagnari? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. The census is incredibly invasive and people need to overcome their nervousness.
[03:44:41.160 --> 03:44:51.160]  The outside envelope says, the law requires you to fill this out. That's not true. The Constitution requires government to ask,
[03:44:51.160 --> 03:45:02.160]  but you are under no obligation to answer it. And, I mean, again, if Congress was actually doing something to protect your life, liberty and property,
[03:45:02.160 --> 03:45:08.160]  it would be in your best interest to answer. But since Congress is out of control, the White House is out of control.
[03:45:08.160 --> 03:45:15.160]  Oh, boy, the Supreme Court is way out of control. It really doesn't matter whether you answer that or not.
[03:45:15.160 --> 03:45:22.160]  I agree that it's time for Texans to stand up, but I think it's almost time for us to stand up and defend the Alamo again.
[03:45:22.160 --> 03:45:31.160]  Well, that's covered. In fact, Rob Dew is making a new trailer for Don't Trout on Me with just the clip of Bagnari talking about the line in sand.
[03:45:31.160 --> 03:45:38.160]  See if he can grab that. And if we can premiere that in the last segment, just see if he can put it on a desk and run it over here. Thanks.
[03:45:38.160 --> 03:45:42.160]  Bill, in Colorado, you're on the air with Michael Bagnari. Go ahead.
[03:45:42.160 --> 03:45:46.160]  Hi, thanks, Alex. How are you doing, Michael? I'm excellent. Thanks, Bill.
[03:45:46.160 --> 03:46:02.160]  I have a question about the formation of the Constitution, and I was curious as to who was in charge of America after the Declaration of Independence and prior to the Constitution?
[03:46:02.160 --> 03:46:08.160]  Well, the people who were fighting the revolution were kind of in charge.
[03:46:08.160 --> 03:46:12.160]  It was the Continental Congress out of Philadelphia.
[03:46:12.160 --> 03:46:27.160]  And they wrote the Articles of Confederation. I'm sorry. That was the first Constitution. All federal laws had to be passed unanimously by all 13 states.
[03:46:27.160 --> 03:46:36.160]  If we were still under the Articles of Confederation, you'd understand how small the government would be because you'd need all 50 states to be unanimous.
[03:46:36.160 --> 03:46:48.160]  The Constitution was a deviation from what we had. The Constitution was ratified by only 9 out of 13 states, and it centralized the government.
[03:46:48.160 --> 03:46:55.160]  People act like this is a conspiracy. They have seminars where they go exposing the Constitution, the tyranny.
[03:46:55.160 --> 03:47:05.160]  They almost lost the government over it. That's why the Bill of Rights was created as a checkmate to supersede any expansion of federal power.
[03:47:05.160 --> 03:47:12.160]  And that's the federalist papers. People think that federalism means the federal government runs things. No, it means the opposite. Michael Bagnarek.
[03:47:12.160 --> 03:47:21.160]  Absolutely. Alexander Hamilton's group. Alexander Hamilton was a monarchist. His group of people were nationalists.
[03:47:21.160 --> 03:47:40.160]  Thomas Jefferson's people were truly federalists, but Alexander Hamilton switched the labels, called his own group federalists, so he'd get support, and called Jefferson's group anti-federalists to generate hostility towards that group.
[03:47:40.160 --> 03:47:42.160]  So he was a spin doctor of his time.
[03:47:42.160 --> 03:47:44.160]  But he got dealt with.
[03:47:44.160 --> 03:47:47.160]  He did. In a duel.
[03:47:47.160 --> 03:47:53.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Howard in Philly. Howard, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:47:53.160 --> 03:48:05.160]  Hello, Michael. You answered my question about the 14th Amendment. I was going to bring that up, but I still want to talk about something in the 14th Amendment that I think is important to note.
[03:48:05.160 --> 03:48:18.160]  The word United States citizens can be found in the Constitution, so it existed prior to the 14th Amendment. I do believe that prior to the 14th Amendment...
[03:48:18.160 --> 03:48:20.160]  I'll go ahead.
[03:48:20.160 --> 03:48:28.160]  I do believe that prior to the 14th Amendment, we were state citizens, just like Richard McDonald used to say years and years ago.
[03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:39.160]  No, that's why the 17th Amendment changed that to where the senators are popularly elected instead of being creatures of the state, where the elected legislature then votes to appoint the senator.
[03:48:39.160 --> 03:48:46.160]  I remember reading about Davey Crockett and people being recalled for not doing what they were told. Michael Bagnari.
[03:48:46.160 --> 03:48:57.160]  I agree. We are state citizens. My book, Good to Be King, discusses this. It's in the chapter on Article 4 of the Constitution.
[03:48:57.160 --> 03:49:08.160]  But we were state citizens, and then the 14th Amendment created a corporate status of United States citizen, which is subject to the jurisdiction of Congress.
[03:49:08.160 --> 03:49:20.160]  So it's a lot of fraud, a lot of deceit, a lot of misdirection. But again, it's only a piece of paper. If government says that you're a seven-foot-tall purple rabbit, that doesn't make it true.
[03:49:20.160 --> 03:49:27.160]  All right. I appreciate your call, Howard. Let's go ahead and talk to Ronny in Illinois. Ronny, go ahead.
[03:49:27.160 --> 03:49:35.160]  Hey, it's good to talk to you guys. According to the 14th Amendment, get into that.
[03:49:35.160 --> 03:49:43.160]  I don't know if you guys are familiar with James Burden, author of Sins of the State. For any of the listeners out there, you can find that at SinsoftheState.net.
[03:49:43.160 --> 03:49:50.160]  It gets in and exposes how, in 1862, they redefined the word person. Yeah, it made us wards of a federal government.
[03:49:50.160 --> 03:49:56.160]  Yes, Bagnaric has written about this. His book's available at constitutionpreservation.org.
[03:49:56.160 --> 03:50:01.160]  Right. But I mean, it sounds like you guys are almost pulling the idea that you have to withdraw your consent.
[03:50:01.160 --> 03:50:04.160]  I mean, you really do have to tell these people who you are, and there is a...
[03:50:04.160 --> 03:50:09.160]  No, Bagnaric's not saying that. He's saying this is a lawless group of criminals. We're here...
[03:50:09.160 --> 03:50:16.160]  Look, I've been doing this for 17 years on air for 15. I've probably done 200 programs on the 14th Amendment.
[03:50:16.160 --> 03:50:20.160]  I just suddenly have people telling me about it like I just found it yesterday.
[03:50:20.160 --> 03:50:27.160]  And all Michael Bagnaric is saying is, just like Aaron Russo said in his film, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[03:50:27.160 --> 03:50:31.160]  He said it's criminal. The IRS is a fraud. We didn't have it until 1913.
[03:50:31.160 --> 03:50:34.160]  But they're criminals. They'll come arrest you if you don't pay it.
[03:50:34.160 --> 03:50:39.160]  So, Bagnaric is saying, you're right. This is true. But this patriot mythology,
[03:50:39.160 --> 03:50:45.160]  like Nassara and all these groups that say we're mailing letters to the government, everything's solved.
[03:50:45.160 --> 03:50:49.160]  I mean, did George Washington mail a letter to King George III?
[03:50:49.160 --> 03:50:55.160]  Oh, was George Washington poo-pooing human liberty? No. I don't understand.
[03:50:55.160 --> 03:51:01.160]  I think you guys are picking a fight. Probably all buddies calling in. It's bizarre. We'll be back.
[03:51:01.160 --> 03:51:04.160]  Don't answer it.
[03:51:04.160 --> 03:51:08.160]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings knowing it may be another bill collector,
[03:51:08.160 --> 03:51:13.160]  it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days, 800-477-9256.
[03:51:13.160 --> 03:51:20.160]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:51:20.160 --> 03:51:24.160]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:31.160]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 Days guaranteed without a payment plan and without attorneys or going to court.
[03:51:31.160 --> 03:51:36.160]  Get the fastest relief from debt on the planet when you call 800-477-9256.

[03:53:18.160 --> 03:53:22.160]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[03:53:22.160 --> 03:53:27.160]  The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[03:53:27.160 --> 03:53:30.160]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.

[03:54:33.160 --> 03:54:39.160]  There's another one. New UK government to be infested with bankers, just like our new Supreme Court nominees at Goldman Sachs Minion.
[03:54:39.160 --> 03:54:41.160]  That's all up at GCNLive.com.
[03:54:41.160 --> 03:54:46.160]  I'm not trying to get in a fight with the last three collars here. I just don't know where it's coming from.
[03:54:46.160 --> 03:54:50.160]  Michael Bagnarek, I've read his book. It's good to be king. I've known him for 12 years.
[03:54:50.160 --> 03:54:54.160]  I mean, it's all he talks about is the 14th Amendment, and they're saying, why aren't you covering it?
[03:54:54.160 --> 03:54:59.160]  Why are you pooping it? Alex, why are you saying 9-11 isn't an inside job?
[03:54:59.160 --> 03:55:03.160]  I mean, that's the equivalent. Alex, why are you saying you're for the New World Order?
[03:55:03.160 --> 03:55:07.160]  Real fast, Ronnie, because we're almost out of time in Illinois. I don't understand your point.
[03:55:07.160 --> 03:55:13.160]  No, I'm not trying to say that. I mean, you're one of my biggest idols, Alex. I mean, you know...
[03:55:13.160 --> 03:55:17.160]  Well, you don't need to do that. I'm just saying I don't understand the point.
[03:55:17.160 --> 03:55:21.160]  My point is I'm trying to ask, like, what do you propose to do? I mean, here in Illinois, for instance,
[03:55:21.160 --> 03:55:25.160]  I mean, we're making a public declaration and a notice of withdrawal consent.
[03:55:25.160 --> 03:55:30.160]  I mean, we are sending out letters, but I mean, we're getting ourselves out of the system.
[03:55:30.160 --> 03:55:34.160]  And I mean, there's been cases here where, you know, people have been pulled over by officers
[03:55:34.160 --> 03:55:38.160]  and just by simply holding, you know, giving them a piece of paper that says what it says.
[03:55:38.160 --> 03:55:41.160]  Oh, no. I mean, if you tell them you're an illegal alien, they leave you alone a lot.
[03:55:41.160 --> 03:55:44.160]  No, absolutely. But sometimes they drag you off to jail.
[03:55:44.160 --> 03:55:49.160]  But look, we'll do a whole show on this in the future. My whole thing is it's such a dangerous navigation
[03:55:49.160 --> 03:55:53.160]  because there's so much patriot mythology that gets people in prison.
[03:55:53.160 --> 03:55:59.160]  That's why I like Michael Bagnarek or Larry Bcraft. You can count on what they say. Michael, comments on this.
[03:55:59.160 --> 03:56:04.160]  It's a false sense of security. They're not acknowledging or respecting the Constitution.
[03:56:04.160 --> 03:56:11.160]  So if you send them a letter of sovereignty or, you know, your nationality, your estate citizen,
[03:56:11.160 --> 03:56:17.160]  that makes you feel good. But if you think that's going to, you know, cause the government to roll over
[03:56:17.160 --> 03:56:24.160]  and go, well, okay, you can travel without a driver's license because, you know, you figured out the game, you're naive.
[03:56:24.160 --> 03:56:27.160]  You know, the Constitution is not there to protect you and it won't.
[03:56:27.160 --> 03:56:35.160]  Standing a railroad track with the copy of the Constitution in front of you and with a train coming, you'll see exactly how much protection it has.
[03:56:35.160 --> 03:56:43.160]  We have to take the counties, the cities, the states back and then enforce it and use grand juries in guiding trees in a scum.
[03:56:43.160 --> 03:56:50.160]  We've got to indict Goldman Sachs, as Ron Paul has said. I want to play a one minute clip from the film Don't Tread on Me,
[03:56:50.160 --> 03:56:53.160]  describing the line in the sand. Here it is.
[03:56:57.160 --> 03:57:03.160]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:57:03.160 --> 03:57:08.160]  First of all, as a Texan, I would like to point out this is a reference to the Alamo.
[03:57:08.160 --> 03:57:21.160]  Colonel William Travis recognized that the outcome was hopeless and he told the men at the Alamo that he could not, in good conscience,
[03:57:21.160 --> 03:57:32.160]  order them to stay and fight. He took his saber and drew a line in the sand and he indicated that regardless of what they did,
[03:57:32.160 --> 03:57:41.160]  he, William Travis, was going to stay at the Alamo and even if necessary, single-handedly defend the fort.
[03:57:41.160 --> 03:57:53.160]  The line in the sand has come to be your final straw, the last outcome, much like survival, individual survival.
[03:57:53.160 --> 03:57:56.160]  That is a personal issue.
[03:57:56.160 --> 03:58:02.160]  Absolutely. The film starts shipping out Monday. Get it today. Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:58:02.160 --> 03:58:08.160]  You can also go to Michael McNerrick's website and find out more. Get his book, Constitutionpreservation.org.
[03:58:08.160 --> 03:58:12.160]  I'm sorry to all the other callers. I'll be back live tomorrow and, of course, on Thursday and Friday.
[03:58:12.160 --> 03:58:21.160]  But, Michael, great having you back here with us. The tyrants getting so out of control, that's only going to accelerate the awakening that's happening.
[03:58:21.160 --> 03:58:32.160]  Absolutely. I'll be lighting the fires of liberty in Austin, June 13th. If anybody wants to take my class, I'll be in Austin on June 13th.
[03:58:32.160 --> 03:58:38.160]  They can find out more at Constitutionpreservation.org and at infowars.com. Michael McNerrick, God bless you, my friend.
[03:58:38.160 --> 03:58:40.160]  God bless you, Alex Jones.
[03:58:40.160 --> 03:58:52.160]  Great job, crew.
