[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:23.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones hard to
[00:23.280 --> 00:31.040]  believe it's already Friday the 18th day of March 2016 I'm your host Alex Jones we're gonna be
[00:31.040 --> 00:38.320]  here live for the next four hours as we are Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central then
[00:38.320 --> 00:44.840]  back weeknights and 7 o'clock central infowars nightly news and I'll be back hosting this Sunday
[00:44.840 --> 00:53.280]  4 to 6 p.m. Central live I don't know I might do a rebroadcaster have somebody sit in for me
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.560]  because I might take the kids on a hike you know what so much is happening I'm gonna come in
[00:58.560 --> 01:06.320]  Sunday but we do have something very special coming up at the bottom of the next hour it has
[01:06.320 --> 01:15.120]  to deal with Barack Obama and it is let's just say news making and very important to the future of
[01:15.120 --> 01:22.240]  this country in the world if you out there watching decide that you want this information to get out
[01:22.240 --> 01:28.440]  to a wider audience so we'll break some important Intel coming up at the bottom of the second hour
[01:28.440 --> 01:36.280]  today Dr. Jerome course he's gonna be joining us for part of the third hour and David night will be
[01:36.280 --> 01:42.360]  hosting the fourth hour you're a new listener that's how we work at three hours of infowars with
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.400]  your truly Alex Jones and then a fourth hour of overdrive that a lot of stations are picking up
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.440]  that's got all the latest breaking news a lot of the special reports we didn't get to were things
[01:52.440 --> 01:57.560]  that fell through the cracks phone calls special guests and more and that fourth hour is really
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.240]  growing so I want to thank all the stations picking it up I'm trying to be calm right now
[02:02.240 --> 02:10.680]  and I want to be deliberative today at least for a little while before I spin out of control and
[02:10.680 --> 02:17.080]  start hyperventilating and my voice becomes grating even to my ears and I just have a
[02:17.080 --> 02:22.760]  cornucopia of obviously super important news to cover but as I sat here looking at all this this
[02:22.760 --> 02:28.200]  morning and as I sat there reading the news earlier this morning at home I thought what's
[02:28.200 --> 02:36.440]  really most important right now to talk about there is a big global awakening part of that
[02:36.440 --> 02:42.520]  is manifest through Trump and the establishment's taken the mask off the gloves off and saying we're
[02:42.520 --> 02:50.040]  just gonna steal it from him they're trying to sell that idea right now I'm very brazen so the
[02:50.040 --> 02:54.760]  arrogance of the establishment and how they're going to counter strike is important but really
[02:54.760 --> 03:03.160]  sitting back military developments and military escalation is something that historically people
[03:04.040 --> 03:12.040]  aren't really worried about until a huge war kicks off and the climate is so right for that
[03:12.040 --> 03:20.920]  it's like when you have tornado season in the spring or hurricane season in the late summer
[03:20.920 --> 03:28.120]  early fall at you know it's the time of the season then I was sitting back thinking what's
[03:28.120 --> 03:35.000]  the main driver of that and it's always economics and I remembered two stories in the stack yesterday
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.680]  that I didn't even cover and I really get mad at myself for this because it was front and center and
[03:40.680 --> 03:48.520]  I went off into the outrageousness of the republican national committee rules committee head on tv
[03:48.520 --> 03:53.960]  saying your vote doesn't count and then the anchor goes really and you know yeah just get used to it
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.720]  it's the way it's always been no it's not the way it's always been and so that's another angle on how
[04:03.080 --> 04:06.600]  everything they do is about just normalizing it and calmly
[04:06.600 --> 04:14.280]  waltzing up and just getting you to accept it and I likened that to growing up bird hunting
[04:14.280 --> 04:19.320]  that I learned if I saw some dove flying to a tree 200 yards away that if I acted like I was
[04:19.320 --> 04:24.440]  stalking up and walked slowly and had my eyes on the tree they'd fly off but if I just kind of
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.440]  walked in an angle like I wasn't going over there and stopped and picked something up and then
[04:28.440 --> 04:33.000]  walked back over they'd sit there five minutes and I always got to blast them and that's what
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.880]  they're doing they're just kind of nothing's going on but while that's happening there you see all the
[04:37.880 --> 04:45.080]  preparations being set up for worldwide martial law political persecution mass arrest forced
[04:45.080 --> 04:50.920]  inoculations for population control and then there's these two stories I didn't get to yesterday
[04:50.920 --> 04:56.520]  I'm going to hit them on the other side but these are definitely dominoes now falling
[04:56.520 --> 05:03.720]  we can create a state of the art rail system which takes us off the road
[05:04.680 --> 05:09.560]  last week live trucking dot com posted this clip of bernie sanders bragging about new
[05:09.560 --> 05:14.680]  innovations in rail technology that will take big rigs off the road the article from early
[05:14.680 --> 05:19.080]  march poses the question will the trucking industry be significantly downsized under a
[05:19.080 --> 05:24.120]  sanders presidency most sanders critics focus on his socialist domestic economic plan and bernie
[05:24.120 --> 05:29.000]  makes no secret that he intends to raise taxes on everyone yet on top of bernie's socialist programs
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.880]  there are the draconian environmental policies he is proposing carbon taxes and carbon offsets are
[05:33.880 --> 05:38.600]  a centerpiece of the earth worship religion in addition societies must build vast collectivist
[05:38.600 --> 05:43.080]  infrastructures for instance bernie sanders discusses a new type of rail system that will
[05:43.080 --> 05:47.080]  take trucks off the road and the truck drivers along with them the statement made by sanders
[05:47.080 --> 05:51.560]  and others like him is just a small glimpse into what this new slave utopia will look like

[08:21.080 --> 08:29.000]  want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[08:34.760 --> 08:39.240]  i want to open the phones up today like i did yesterday for first time callers and i want to
[08:39.240 --> 08:45.080]  tell good callers something i intend to not make you hold 30 minutes or an hour today
[08:45.080 --> 08:49.160]  what's going to happen is from now on if people have been holding more than 30 minutes
[08:49.160 --> 08:53.480]  we are just going to let those folks go and open the phones back up again
[08:53.480 --> 08:58.360]  because it's not fair to do that and that's a standard talk radio practice that i lazily
[08:58.360 --> 09:03.960]  have really never engaged in and i need to so we're going to be opening the phones up
[09:04.760 --> 09:12.680]  and going to your phone calls boom boom boom uh that way uh hard hitting folks that actually
[09:12.680 --> 09:16.840]  have something to say can get in because we have wonderful callers but when also you know
[09:16.840 --> 09:22.520]  sit there and have people hold for an hour it kind of degenerates sometimes i specifically
[09:22.520 --> 09:27.160]  want to hear from you now usually it's a free for all but this is first time callers and
[09:27.160 --> 09:34.360]  specifically i want to pick your brain i'd like to hear from you about what you think the most
[09:34.360 --> 09:40.760]  important issues in the world are right now and what you're most concerned about
[09:40.760 --> 09:47.720]  i also asked people on facebook yesterday on the facebook mentions video i did and i'm
[09:47.720 --> 09:55.320]  going to go through some of their comments coming up and was asking what do we do to counter
[10:00.440 --> 10:08.120]  this attempt to hoax the public into believing that it's okay to not honor the popular vote
[10:08.120 --> 10:15.640]  that the delegates represent at the rnc or the dnc now hillary was smart she openly said the
[10:15.640 --> 10:20.200]  delegates are pledged to me i don't care if i lose a bunch of states i still get the delegates
[10:20.200 --> 10:26.440]  and she did that it's been proven she stole ohio that's come out in their news nobody cares now
[10:26.440 --> 10:35.720]  it's been proven that she got less votes by 20 in new ham sure but she got more of the delegates
[10:35.720 --> 10:43.960]  she just steals it outright at the moment and has her people i wondered why we could go talk to
[10:43.960 --> 10:48.360]  her super delegates and people who were in new ham sure when i'm from california you saw the video
[10:48.360 --> 10:52.440]  interview and they're like yeah no the party elected me that's what counts the votes don't count
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.840]  it doesn't matter if she loses she's gonna win that's how we work this
[10:58.520 --> 11:04.520]  just like the republican head of the rnc rules committee of 29 people he's been going on tv and
[11:04.520 --> 11:10.040]  radio going no your vote doesn't count this isn't the way it's always been it's totally normal no
[11:10.040 --> 11:18.440]  it's not totally normal the democrats changed it in 72 the republicans changed it uh in 1976
[11:18.440 --> 11:25.480]  and people say well it's their party their rules no they hold it out like popular vote matters so
[11:25.480 --> 11:33.240]  it's fraud and it's racketeering and it's organized crime and taxpayer money is spent to run these
[11:33.240 --> 11:39.960]  elections at the county level and so because they claim that they changed a private party rule
[11:40.520 --> 11:44.840]  doesn't cover them but they run that hoax that they can do it oh we're allowed to spy on you
[11:44.840 --> 11:50.120]  without warrants because we got a doj memo oh we're allowed to confiscate your guns outside of law
[11:50.120 --> 11:55.160]  because we got a doj memo oh we're allowed to torture people and their family members because
[11:55.160 --> 12:06.200]  we got a doj memo from john you and gonzalez alberto gonzalez and all the rest is craziness
[12:07.320 --> 12:12.040]  but it's okay when john you says torture people bury their kids alive pull their fingernails out
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.120]  and alberto gonzalez puts that out as the attorney general because he's hispanic
[12:16.120 --> 12:21.240]  and john used chinese they actually said that in the news is there pressure against john you and
[12:21.240 --> 12:28.360]  gonzalez because of racism no because they were making flaming fascist statements and
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.880]  then carrying it out and then when cia would get caught torturing people to death they would get
[12:33.880 --> 12:40.280]  indicted on top of it so the people giving the orders didn't get in trouble but the people doing
[12:40.280 --> 12:52.840]  it did now i said i was going to get to what i think is one of the biggest issues but i'm
[12:52.840 --> 12:59.960]  saying i want to hear from you with what do you think is the biggest threat to humanity right now
[13:01.240 --> 13:05.400]  and what you see going into the future and how we stop it and how do we stop them stealing this
[13:05.400 --> 13:10.920]  election how do we counter that i think the answers some of the things that the folks were
[13:10.920 --> 13:17.640]  saying on facebook that i was reading and what buckley said we need to have a million people
[13:17.640 --> 13:22.040]  show up there will be provocateurs that try to start violence but the system trying to steal an
[13:22.040 --> 13:28.440]  election it's their fault if things degenerate at this point we can't lay down we need a million
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.720]  people to counter soros and the 50 000 thugs that he's hired that he's going to send in there
[13:33.720 --> 13:37.640]  so they can't intimidate free speech you got megan kelly i was on the elliptical this morning
[13:38.840 --> 13:43.240]  and then i was doing deadlifts and i had fox news on
[13:45.720 --> 13:51.720]  and so i i had an hour and 15 minutes of fox news on as i worked out for an hour and 15 minutes
[13:52.280 --> 13:58.280]  so i saw the promo at least six or seven times or heard it because i was you had the volume up
[13:58.280 --> 14:05.720]  wasn't watching all the time and it was tonight megan kelly will expose trump
[14:05.720 --> 14:11.720]  going after the first amendment is he blocking the first amendment is he violating it megan
[14:11.720 --> 14:17.880]  kelly talks to the demonstrators who've been attacked been assaulted and they had always
[14:17.880 --> 14:24.600]  different variant promos and i was like this is like msnbc now you notice roober murdoch announced
[14:24.600 --> 14:31.160]  a month ago they're going to quote move towards hillary see they've always been there to manage
[14:31.160 --> 14:35.000]  conservatives and keep you on the plantation keep you on the reservation but now they are
[14:35.000 --> 14:43.400]  uncloaking and they've got a harpy siren up there looking at you on the teleprompter
[14:43.400 --> 14:47.720]  after a decade trying to hypnotize you i mean they train those women they train
[14:47.720 --> 14:52.120]  the men how to act different this is well known in broadcasting at that level how to look at the
[14:52.120 --> 14:58.440]  camera like they're in love with you and they want to get you in bed and i watch grown men
[14:58.440 --> 15:03.960]  in in in in the hotel bars i've been in or in restaurants or on the street or at the gym
[15:03.960 --> 15:10.920]  watching megan kelly and smiling back at her and and and acting like the skipper on gilligan's island
[15:10.920 --> 15:18.840]  when uh ginger comes over and wants to do some work for her she'll go uh skip areas so manly to do
[15:18.840 --> 15:23.800]  do you mind carrying these coconuts up for me and catching me some fish and bringing some water up
[15:23.800 --> 15:32.120]  from the creek sweetie pie and and men sit there with this hd tv looking at this perfectly quote
[15:32.120 --> 15:37.560]  beautiful woman but her eyes now aren't i'm your sweetheart she's already got you hypnotized now
[15:37.560 --> 15:48.120]  they're steely cold praying on the american people you like being conned fox news is a what
[15:48.120 --> 15:57.320]  20 year con job and to shon hannity's credit i'm really getting a lot of respect for shon hannity
[15:57.320 --> 16:02.680]  he's saying he'll walk from the republican party i was sent a clip the other day i meant to play
[16:02.680 --> 16:06.600]  where he was on his own radio show saying he doesn't like the direction fox is going and you can say
[16:06.600 --> 16:11.560]  well he he knows what you know which way the wind's blowing people aren't putting up with this okay
[16:13.400 --> 16:16.840]  or maybe he really does care about the country hey all i care about is the fact he's doing the
[16:16.840 --> 16:21.800]  right thing more and more and talking about world government talking about new world order and
[16:23.320 --> 16:27.320]  not sitting there saying the liberty movement's dangerous and alex jones is dangerous you know
[16:27.320 --> 16:33.080]  shon hannity's now plugging info wars on air so good for shon hannity because i don't want to be
[16:33.080 --> 16:36.920]  enemies with any of these people i don't want to be enemies with megan kelly
[16:42.040 --> 16:45.800]  in fact it was probably six seven years ago i was on her show back when she co-hosted with
[16:45.800 --> 16:51.080]  the other guy joe bigs has been on there repeatedly i mean i don't even care i don't care about going
[16:51.080 --> 16:56.920]  on her show three and a half million viewers folks i do facebook mentions from my parents hot cub
[16:57.880 --> 17:04.120]  that get two million views four million five million i mean these people are in their own world
[17:08.440 --> 17:15.320]  and that gets to the hubris that i'm talking about the blindness of the political elite and these
[17:15.320 --> 17:24.360]  painted sirens that they put up there on television to sell us on all this they really think they can
[17:24.360 --> 17:30.040]  control the narrative and this is only the beginning of their control crumbling this is only the start
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.440]  historically we're in that cycle we're in the beginning of that and they still don't get it
[17:40.600 --> 17:43.640]  is it north korea threatening to nuk their neighbors and russia threatening to invade
[17:43.640 --> 17:54.840]  is it what's happening economically is it the open attack uncloaked unveiled not debatable yes your
[17:54.840 --> 18:00.760]  vote doesn't count and and just voting fraud all over the country texas came out and said that
[18:00.760 --> 18:06.120]  was fraud against trump yes clearly uh stuff happened the election commission admits it almost no
[18:06.120 --> 18:15.320]  news coverage ohio admits fraud stole it from uh stole it from sanders where is the left even caring
[18:17.400 --> 18:22.440]  i mean we're reaching a point where we're awake but it's like we're awake and the pygmies have
[18:22.440 --> 18:31.320]  put us in the big cook bowl to roast us we need to climb out of the boiling water immediately so
[18:31.320 --> 18:37.880]  here's the big news that i mentioned in the last segment that i didn't get to yesterday that i think
[18:37.880 --> 18:42.440]  is the most important domino that's already falling there's some other bigger dominoes that
[18:42.440 --> 18:52.760]  could be world ending like nuclear war i don't agree with scouson on the fact that it'll end up
[18:52.760 --> 18:55.960]  being limited it once it starts it's not going to be limited and i agree with him on almost
[18:55.960 --> 19:04.120]  everything he's a really savvy guy and i think that's the optimus in him but the nukes ever come out
[19:04.120 --> 19:11.800]  of the come out of the silos and come out of the submarines and get launched out of the bottoms

[24:31.080 --> 24:37.560]  from europe to africa from russia to the middle east it was always the same
[24:39.160 --> 24:46.440]  ruling elites with military force dominating and controlling the peasantry and using them as
[24:46.440 --> 24:53.400]  chattel slaves but over the thousands of years of civilization in the last 6000 years the more
[24:53.400 --> 24:59.400]  prosperous civilizations got away from slavery and into middle classes and a tradesman class
[24:59.400 --> 25:07.240]  and a merchant class that would develop wealth and art and then empires would rise on the wealth
[25:07.240 --> 25:15.640]  of their farmers of their artisans of their blacksmiths but would still have militaries to defend
[25:17.800 --> 25:24.200]  their technology globalism is the opposite of that it brings in world government plays the

[25:37.800 --> 25:44.200]  against humanity is the ultimate form of discrimination to have your laws made in secret
[25:44.200 --> 25:52.200]  by multinational corporations exempt from the taxes and rules and laws they foist on you no wonder
[25:52.200 --> 26:01.960]  they want to teach you about black slavery and the kkk in thousands of hours now in public education
[26:01.960 --> 26:09.640]  so that you're just totally obsessed on one tiny part of history and have no idea that everyone
[26:09.640 --> 26:18.600]  is having their basic freedoms destroyed right in front of them and that there is a medical
[26:18.600 --> 26:27.640]  soft kill operation to stun and poison and dumb down humanity to soften us up for the final blow
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.040]  and i think about the white house run publications like media matters and
[26:34.040 --> 26:39.400]  everybody else that almost every day write these stories about how crazy i am that there's a government
[26:39.400 --> 26:45.640]  plan to secretly test on us there's thousands of declassified lethal studies that were done
[26:45.640 --> 26:51.880]  on everybody in this country you know why the media only reported on black people being injected
[26:51.880 --> 26:57.880]  with syphilis because they knew whites would go oh that's not happening to us oh it's bad it's
[26:57.880 --> 27:04.440]  terrible but oh they did it to those people and then it would never be in the news taking thousands
[27:04.440 --> 27:10.600]  of orphan white children and putting them in radiation chambers in the 40s and 50s and 60s
[27:10.600 --> 27:17.160]  and frying them in some cases with so much radiation they were dead in minutes department

[27:49.400 --> 27:58.760]  debt and notice what's happening the private federal reserve buys it and then puts it on the
[27:58.760 --> 28:08.040]  taxpayer list as money we owe they don't just buy it in fiat and claim it's propped up which would
[28:08.040 --> 28:13.880]  be dangerous enough they buy it and then say it's debts that you and i and all of us our children
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.800]  owe our grandchildren owe but don't worry it's not children and grandchildren now they're gonna

[29:05.000 --> 29:12.200]  it'd do something you know at least it's like giving you a final meal before you're executed

[38:14.440 --> 38:19.880]  else was just like could hardly you know get out or you'll fight because they didn't know why people

[38:24.680 --> 38:33.800]  limies would pull up and kill everybody because they had little key lime limes and the men didn't
[38:33.800 --> 38:40.680]  like it but they made them drink it they put it in their rum mixed with water called grog and the

[39:10.120 --> 39:15.320]  claiming it's nano or this or that folks you don't want to go smaller than 30 parts per million
[39:17.160 --> 39:22.680]  you don't want to go higher because it does become toxic look if it's going to kill bacteria and
[39:22.680 --> 39:30.200]  viruses you think it's good for you it is an element study show you need a little bit of it
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.800]  but it's i don't tell people take silver every day you got a sore throat anabas will knock it out
[39:35.800 --> 39:41.240]  i drank three bottles some of the stuff killed family i had i wish i could have got the down them
[39:41.960 --> 39:45.640]  my dad did two rounds anabas couldn't get better with this stuff two years ago that killed my uncle
[39:47.400 --> 39:52.440]  i went dump three bottles down him in a week he says it's toxic at that level and i said dad i know
[39:52.440 --> 39:58.600]  that so is chemotherapy getting rid of cancer but some people it's like marijuana users oh it's god
[39:58.600 --> 40:03.080]  it's perfect it fixes everything no it's not it's got a lot of good uses it's got a lot of pitfalls
[40:03.080 --> 40:09.000]  same thing with silver do your own research it's powerful though i'm gonna stop i promise to go
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.400]  to your calls dj sam jared elijah justin if you just joined us about 30 minutes ago i put the call
[40:15.400 --> 40:20.440]  out what do you think the number one issue is facing humanity and what do you think the next big
[40:20.440 --> 40:25.480]  globalist move is going to be to distract and divert and kind of dynamite this movement of
[40:25.480 --> 40:32.520]  liberty that is accelerating what do you think about that and that the bottom of the next hour
[40:32.520 --> 40:37.560]  big announcement on obama big breaking news you don't want to miss it we're going to put the video
[40:37.560 --> 40:41.720]  out and then post it in fours dot com when we make the announcement at the bottom of the next hour
[40:43.080 --> 40:47.480]  but right now let's go ahead and go to dj in texas dj thanks for calling
[40:49.080 --> 40:55.560]  hey you know mr elijah good my friend i was gonna i was gonna say our number one problem that i think
[40:55.560 --> 41:01.000]  i could speak for america it's probably a race war and the main reason is misunderstandings on
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.320]  both sides like y'all say that the media hikes up the police violence is not really true you can go
[41:07.320 --> 41:13.560]  look up in houston it's in the early 1900s in the red summer you can see the beef between police
[41:13.560 --> 41:18.920]  and black people in and then you can go all the way back during slavery police really rose out of
[41:18.920 --> 41:24.520]  a group called the slave patrollers and they had that same mentality today when they see black people
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.560]  the way they interact with them it's not all about just getting shot by them it's the way that they
[41:29.560 --> 41:35.480]  interact with black people we grown people these people nobody but citizens who went to go get a
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.880]  job they're not even they're not god or nothing they can't just shoot black people on the spot
[41:39.880 --> 41:43.960]  can't shoot white people on the spot can't shoot anybody on the spot we got to tell these people
[41:43.960 --> 41:49.080]  how to govern this they can't tell us how we want to be governed that's not how america set up
[41:49.080 --> 41:55.560]  and that's not what my answer is to sign up for it well you you are right that uh the first police
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.360]  departments that weren't sheriff's departments metropolitan police departments were like in
[42:00.360 --> 42:07.080]  new york and boston and that was because gangs were killing each other people organized and
[42:07.080 --> 42:13.960]  always have around race or religion and so you would have the irish gangs with the wasp gangs
[42:13.960 --> 42:20.280]  with the italian gangs just like the movie gangs of new york that is exactly what went on and so
[42:20.280 --> 42:26.280]  the police became the biggest street gang basically out there and then the irish went and would try
[42:26.280 --> 42:32.040]  to join the police force basically to then make the police force an irish gang because they felt
[42:32.040 --> 42:36.520]  like they'd been persecuted and things like that that's generally what forces people into gangs
[42:36.520 --> 42:41.960]  but then they become what they claim that they were fighting uh so law enforcement as it's called
[42:41.960 --> 42:48.600]  really comes out of peace officers elected officers of the court of the jury of the grand jury
[42:48.600 --> 42:55.640]  who are instructed on the laws and then commanded uh i mean that's why people are commanded if you
[42:55.640 --> 43:00.920]  go back to the old warrants and things to then go out and bring people to the court of we the people
[43:01.640 --> 43:07.640]  but it's devolved to where the police and the government the system has become this new royalty
[43:07.640 --> 43:12.680]  that has given itself immunity and certainly they've militarized police certainly they've
[43:12.680 --> 43:18.040]  tried to corrupt them certainly they've done this and i appreciate your call sir and i do think race
[43:18.040 --> 43:27.480]  war social division class warfare is being stoked so you kind of have a soft cold war rolling kind
[43:27.480 --> 43:33.800]  of secret race war going on that is actually taking a lot of white people that weren't racist before
[43:33.800 --> 43:40.120]  and they're experiencing racism and and it's freaking them out and so they are becoming racist uh
[43:40.120 --> 43:46.360]  at the colleges the ford foundation rockefeller foundation teaches liberation theology where
[43:46.360 --> 43:51.960]  you're oppressed but the federal government's going to save you show that those people then
[43:51.960 --> 43:56.440]  basically see the government and the feds coming in and taking over uh as the solution and alsharp
[43:56.440 --> 43:59.400]  and said it last year he said we're going to federalize all the police we're going to use these
[43:59.400 --> 44:05.320]  police shootings to do it they are inditing and then imprisoning almost all the bad cops that are
[44:05.320 --> 44:09.400]  doing this and then you have like what is it three or four black cops and a white cop you know beat
[44:09.400 --> 44:14.840]  some guy to death inside you know it evidence is pretty clear uh inside you know the back of a
[44:14.840 --> 44:21.800]  patty wagon and and then they go oh my gosh you know it's it's racist whites and then you find out
[44:21.800 --> 44:29.080]  it's you know mainly black guys allegedly that looks like it you're beating this poor person to death
[44:31.880 --> 44:39.400]  once police start piling on it it becomes a feeding frenzy wolves do it sharks do it uh it's
[44:39.400 --> 44:48.120]  it's normal it's not good here's where i am on this you can pull up the justice department numbers
[44:48.120 --> 44:52.840]  it varies year to year but nine out of ten black people are killed by other black people
[44:54.520 --> 45:00.040]  most white people are killed by white people most killings it's somebody you know it's a beef
[45:00.040 --> 45:08.760]  and most of it is quote gang related that's what it comes down to
[45:09.880 --> 45:16.440]  and so it's a red herring in the aggregate if you look at police killing black people and
[45:16.440 --> 45:23.560]  police mistreating black people if you look at the numbers it's one of the least dangerous things
[45:23.560 --> 45:28.920]  for a quote african-american use the correct term the most dangerous thing is being in your mother's
[45:28.920 --> 45:36.840]  womb if you're black it's pretty much that way for anybody period any human being then incarceration
[45:36.840 --> 45:42.680]  for petty stuff where you then get indoctrinated you're 14 you're putting you in our hall a bunch
[45:42.680 --> 45:48.120]  of 16 70 year olds beat you up if you don't join their gang and boom you're screwed up for life
[45:48.120 --> 45:55.640]  because you've now been inducted into crime that's a big problem see i said i'll take your calls
[45:55.640 --> 45:59.400]  quickly but this is such a complex issue and i was already thinking about this today here's where
[45:59.400 --> 46:06.600]  i'm at though the globalist with their strong cities initiative all over the world are federalizing
[46:06.600 --> 46:14.680]  local governments and police departments with under un agenda 21 treaties that haven't even
[46:14.680 --> 46:19.320]  ratified in the us but they're following it where they sue the police the just department works for
[46:19.320 --> 46:26.040]  the un they come in and they take over in the name of stopping out of control crazy cops and
[46:26.040 --> 46:30.440]  there are some then you go look at the citizen review boards and you go look at who's on them
[46:30.440 --> 46:38.920]  and it's communist and globalist and people like bill errs who then come out to our events
[46:38.920 --> 46:45.640]  and try to stop our pro-life demonstrations that are peaceful and the cops are so intimidated by
[46:45.640 --> 46:50.200]  them when they show up the cops look at the video of them attacking us put them in handcuffs but
[46:50.200 --> 46:59.080]  don't arrest them as a patriot if i did that i'd be arrested immediately so there's a lot of discrimination
[47:00.760 --> 47:07.960]  going on on so many fronts and there are some out of control police and it's true because
[47:07.960 --> 47:13.240]  the black lives matter and other movements that are out there the police are getting paranoid
[47:13.240 --> 47:18.200]  about black people so it's creating some pushback but it's something that's being oversimplified
[47:19.480 --> 47:25.880]  it's being dumbed down here's why i've gone from harping on the police every day and making films
[47:25.880 --> 47:30.360]  about it and writing books about it my reporters expose bad police and police state practices we
[47:30.360 --> 47:36.040]  fight it but i've learned we get stuff changed at the legislature and we get things changed in the
[47:36.040 --> 47:40.040]  police departments by saying hey we're not your enemy don't you want to live in a free country
[47:40.040 --> 47:46.120]  this is bad go after bad cops clean yourself up don't be federalized see the trap realize what's
[47:46.120 --> 47:52.280]  going on we're all citizens let's work together if we just go attack the police that means the
[47:52.280 --> 47:56.600]  globalists and the social engineers and the bad cops will end up running the show saying see
[47:56.600 --> 48:02.760]  we're under attack do whatever we say that puts them into a gang mentality and us against them
[48:02.760 --> 48:09.320]  mentality that is not what we need we have the moral high ground now finally i'm gonna say this
[48:09.320 --> 48:17.160]  thing go to jared elijah jimmy and sam i gotta hurry social engineering divide and conquer is one
[48:17.160 --> 48:23.080]  of the biggest threats i agree with your call great point but i really can't get behind the black
[48:23.080 --> 48:31.480]  lives matter movement because it's a false movement about hating police about being racist it's basically
[48:31.480 --> 48:39.720]  a clan movement with the persecution complex around it it's a black clan movement it's all
[48:39.720 --> 48:44.760]  about race it's all about division and it's led and funded by george soros a nazi collaborator
[48:44.760 --> 48:51.080]  who divides and conquers other countries along lines this isn't sociology operation this is
[48:51.080 --> 49:01.880]  scientific engineering police kill it varies but a couple thousand people a year and a lot of times
[49:01.880 --> 49:09.160]  they do act like it's a shooting gallery and they're in the wrong but again is a couple thousand
[49:09.160 --> 49:13.160]  people the number one issue in the world like the mainstream media says that's where i'm coming from
[49:13.160 --> 49:20.280]  on this that's why i'm breaking this down because there it is obama administration and you announce
[49:20.280 --> 49:26.040]  global police force to fight extremism in the u.s this is their model everyone wondered how america
[49:26.040 --> 49:31.240]  will fall this is it show their attack is about divide and conquer federalizing and globalizing
[49:31.240 --> 49:37.480]  local police departments using the globalist training police have been given knowing it would
[49:37.480 --> 49:45.240]  blow up in their face against them so that's what i'm saying a civil war with the police as the target
[49:45.240 --> 49:52.520]  is the worst civil war we could have and all civil wars are bad we're the rightful owners of america
[49:52.520 --> 49:58.040]  we're the people we're all having our rights taken we're going under global government the enemy is
[49:58.040 --> 50:03.080]  not the police if a cop's a crazy person and shoots a black guy in the back like in san francisco
[50:03.080 --> 50:08.520]  and then lies about it but it's caught on video i say gives that crazy person the death penalty
[50:08.520 --> 50:15.320]  how dare that jury only give him two years how dare them try to cover up and that was a big liberal
[50:15.320 --> 50:22.360]  police department with minority officers all over the place just the guy just pulls his gun out the
[50:22.360 --> 50:28.520]  guys in handcuffs shoots him right in the back then they run around everybody's cell phones but not
[50:28.520 --> 50:35.080]  one in the train that it stopped i hate the police coming out trying to restrict our free speech it's
[50:35.080 --> 50:39.880]  wrong and i'm going to sit here with moral high ground and say i'm not your enemy and i know most
[50:39.880 --> 50:44.600]  of you aren't criminals and i know most of you want to do a good job and want to protect and serve
[50:47.880 --> 50:56.040]  so you better make sure people around you pull up and and and and and not be thugs and run the
[50:56.040 --> 51:01.400]  thugs out of your department and then i'll add this and i'm done with your call but it's a really
[51:01.400 --> 51:05.400]  important area you bring up the military is the most awake group when i've been out there canvassing
[51:05.400 --> 51:10.680]  on the street on the road all over the country and all over the world the military is the most awake
[51:10.680 --> 51:15.400]  group it's why they're targeted it's why the globalist say they're the number one enemy you know the
[51:15.400 --> 51:22.920]  government's run by a takeover group hijackers actual occupiers we are literally been taken up by
[51:22.920 --> 51:31.800]  me you know the government's run by a takeover group hijackers actual occupiers we are literally been
[51:31.800 --> 51:37.720]  taken over they say the military is the number one enemy the veterans because they understand
[51:37.720 --> 51:42.680]  what's going on more than the general public and then the next group that is the most awake are the
[51:42.680 --> 51:51.240]  police i've just i mean i live this stuff i know look if the government hates the military because
[51:51.240 --> 51:57.720]  armed force they control but they fear who else you think they hate they keep the cops on a real
[51:57.720 --> 52:02.200]  short leash when it actually comes to going after real corruption i want to free the police i want
[52:02.200 --> 52:08.280]  to free everybody else i want to make america free again and i know the truth we have is contagious
[52:10.600 --> 52:16.600]  i know the enemy program it's historical it's not hard to understand once you take the blinders off
[52:16.600 --> 52:21.560]  so we're run by foreign megabanks trying to bankrupt us trying to tell us that mother and father is an
[52:21.560 --> 52:31.000]  evil word literally and but my enemy is a cop you think cops want to go out and write tickets cops
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.800]  all over the country try to get out of the quota system they they're unions put ads in the newspaper
[52:35.800 --> 52:41.880]  they leak it they don't want to do that most cops want to go after thugs most cops want to help
[52:41.880 --> 52:47.480]  change ladies tires most cops want to be good and then they see what the police look like on tv with
[52:47.480 --> 52:56.200]  the media distorting it showing the bad ones and then the good ones go i'm not in this anymore or
[52:56.200 --> 53:01.800]  good people whose family have been police officers aside you know what i'm not going to be a cop and
[53:01.800 --> 53:07.160]  then things really get bad and you get a bunch of criminals in charge and then you're in trouble but
[53:07.160 --> 53:12.600]  i want to tell criminal police something else you think these globalists don't want to break the back
[53:12.600 --> 53:18.600]  of this country even a criminal should want general prosperity and most criminals aren't total
[53:18.600 --> 53:23.240]  psychopaths they don't want to just screw the whole nation over for fun you just found it's easier
[53:23.240 --> 53:29.400]  to steal than you know actually have a real job everybody should be against this new world order
[53:29.400 --> 53:34.200]  hey let me ask sociopathic criminal cops out there did you get a memo not to drink fluoride did you
[53:34.200 --> 53:39.240]  get a memo about what's in the vaccine the department's pushing on you you guys get lined up and get
[53:39.240 --> 53:45.960]  given the shots and then a third of you are sick for a week we are under attack all of us together
[53:45.960 --> 53:50.920]  we have to come together that's the number one answer that doesn't mean come together and go hug
[53:50.920 --> 53:56.520]  black lives matter in george soros you know black lives matters federally run it's come out run by
[53:56.520 --> 54:00.120]  the justice department in george soros i mean they actually have their operatives going around saying
[54:00.120 --> 54:05.480]  kill the cops deck the halls with dead cops and then the cops are getting killed and then the cop
[54:05.480 --> 54:10.680]  when they pull your kids over is going to be all scared you see how this is a chain reaction okay
[54:10.680 --> 54:19.080]  okay okay okay i don't have a guest joining me till 1233 i'm going to your calls now i even skipped
[54:19.080 --> 54:22.040]  that break because i did that because i'm going to get in the habit when i say i'm going to your
[54:22.040 --> 54:26.120]  calls i'm going to your calls jared in ohio what do you think the number one threat to humanity
[54:26.120 --> 54:32.920]  is and how do we counter it hey i actually appreciate your work um i i think man you know
[54:32.920 --> 54:36.520]  you you covered you covered a lot of the things i was you're nodding my head the whole time you
[54:36.520 --> 54:42.520]  were talking i the irony that i find is that the wealth of our labor is funding all this
[54:42.520 --> 54:47.960]  you know it's uh you know it's we build our own prison we finance our own destruction we
[54:47.960 --> 54:54.120]  invent the inventions they take from us and then use the controllers exactly no that's exactly it
[54:54.120 --> 54:58.120]  it's a supreme irony and i you know it's the thing that really gets me you know every time you
[54:58.120 --> 55:03.560]  know it's tax season now so you know i think you know what you know what kind of oppressive act is
[55:03.560 --> 55:09.400]  my money going to you know uh just burns me more than anything else you know and i and i really
[55:09.400 --> 55:14.040]  think that that all of this that they're trying to create a lot of heat you know uh turning these
[55:14.040 --> 55:19.320]  groups against one another exactly distractions while the globalist mothership sits offshore and
[55:19.320 --> 55:26.120]  sucks everything dry yeah and and i think the technology i might my fear is that the technology
[55:26.120 --> 55:31.400]  uh is going to allow the new world order now to succeed where we're in the past of the dictators
[55:31.400 --> 55:36.520]  failed you know that and i guess that's the whole idea behind 1984 you know when orwell was writing
[55:36.520 --> 55:42.280]  it he was pointing out that the technology um the the ever present monitor that can that can
[55:42.280 --> 55:46.440]  see everything that you're doing um that this is going to be the thing that helps them succeed in
[55:46.440 --> 55:53.720]  their goal um so yeah it's and i but i i sometimes think too that the only thing like you you mentioned
[55:53.720 --> 56:01.720]  uh you know uh alone we we fall in united we stand um two ways forward uh and especially i think you
[56:01.720 --> 56:06.360]  know possibly the the thing that's going to happen or i believe the best way forward is it's going to
[56:06.360 --> 56:12.920]  have to be widespread system opt out uh or like back in the revolution and it's hard to organize
[56:12.920 --> 56:16.840]  those so all of us just stop opting out of big corporate chains that are globalist do your
[56:16.840 --> 56:21.640]  research or the corporate change pro liberty and gives money to pro gun stuff go support them you
[56:21.640 --> 56:25.560]  know it's or or a big change by in america i'm not against chains in and of themselves i'm just
[56:25.560 --> 56:30.520]  saying try to go mom and pop try to withdraw your support from the system great point god bless
[56:30.520 --> 56:35.640]  you jared yeah i do think that the private federal reserve is the root uh the the fact that elite
[56:35.640 --> 56:40.760]  families get to control the issuance of currency and credit they're always going to end up taking
[56:40.760 --> 56:46.440]  over because the whole system's rigged all right i want to go to justin here in a moment but
[56:46.440 --> 56:51.480]  remember the movie the kingsman i only saw that one uh once i need to watch that again it came out
[56:51.480 --> 57:01.400]  last year where the uh billionaire eugenicist globalist uh is samuel l jackson and he's sitting
[57:01.400 --> 57:08.120]  on a computer program through the smartphones to make people become aggravated aggressive and
[57:08.120 --> 57:17.640]  start killing each other and that is basically a dumbed-down version of what's really going on
[57:19.800 --> 57:23.400]  they even admit through the flicker rates on televisions they can make you calm make you
[57:23.400 --> 57:28.840]  angry you name it i mean that's that's in the news but it's beyond that it's layers of programming
[57:28.840 --> 57:33.400]  in the culture everything we're going into a depression people are getting upset so they
[57:33.400 --> 57:37.400]  want to say it's because of white people or it's because of black people and i know we
[57:37.400 --> 57:41.480]  all know this but you know when you have a group of racist people come up to you
[57:43.720 --> 57:49.080]  i mean you know it's it's it's it's upsetting and it's hard to keep taking the moral high ground
[57:50.120 --> 57:54.200]  when people are racist and they hate you for your race they hate you for your religion they hate
[57:54.200 --> 57:58.360]  you for where you live or how you look and you really just want them to have a great life but
[57:58.360 --> 58:03.960]  they decided that they're standing up they're resisting and somehow letting you know that
[58:03.960 --> 58:09.320]  or attacking you is going to free them when all it's doing is making the middle class
[58:10.840 --> 58:16.440]  which has all these groups coming up into it turn and become racist and will make groups
[58:16.440 --> 58:20.840]  put themselves into their own little reservations and that's how the globalist managed big cities
[58:20.840 --> 58:26.520]  it's how they manage prisons it's the paradigm we're gonna come right back with justin and we're

[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.920]  recovering a really powerful topic and that's what's the greatest threat to humanity people say
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:35.080]  well how about talk about the greatest positive thing is that's another show we'll do but knowing
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:41.880]  the threat is what protects all the good there's so much good in this universe that i do think
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:47.560]  looking at the good holding up the good recognizing what's good celebrating what's good is part of
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:53.160]  the battle the cia we always knew this they've declassified in the last few years ran this
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:57.400]  magazine the entire feminist movement in their own annals it's all declassified there's books
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:02.600]  written on it now you can go look it up online to get women in to the workforce to pay taxes
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.640]  so that the state could begin to raise children and now you see them saying that your children
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:13.000]  belong to state on the news and federal court rulings along those lines but they've also
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.560]  declassified that they would pay classical artist sculptors you name it to make ugly things that
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:29.800]  didn't make sense so that they could redefine what beauty is and you go but even something
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:37.400]  ugly can have beauty well no i understand a finer eye with a deeper palette a more sophisticated
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:43.640]  palette that yes you that's an angle but no they directly wanted to do it and force feed it
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.520]  so that we would start accepting ugliness they they built buildings to be ugly starting in the
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.360]  fifties and sixties they didn't want grand beautiful architecture that up lifts the soul
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.880]  it makes you feel good i need to do a whole report on this because it's one thing to just
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.760]  spout off about it when you see all the documents the admissions i show you the ugly buildings and
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:09.480]  notice the people get ugly you can take somebody that doesn't have classical beauty but if they're
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.000]  you know they're filled with light and love and have done something great
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.480]  i mean i see 80 year old ladies you just see the beauty in them because they're alive and
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.480]  they're out in the garden there's bees and they have electricity in their eyes you see some
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:27.400]  hateful person there's nothing uglier i mean we're fighting a spiritual battle and you know
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:33.080]  media matters and folks can make jokes and right wing watch and say alex jones you know says the
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:40.280]  devil is a space alien is running things again allegory real whatever you want to call it
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.560]  the people running this planet are building something artificial and ugly
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.240]  that doesn't work monsanto says they want worldwide
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.440]  for plants not able to reproduce anymore and then you go to them in a factory and that's where
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:08.280]  the one time seed comes from i mean this is fundamentally satanic stuff so yes the bible
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:13.880]  says an entity was marooned on this planet and wants to destroy us
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.160]  and then i go study the elite they're all into the occult they worship lucifer they think lucifer
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:26.280]  is god they are building a world government with high technology that they believe will make them
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:34.040]  new gods and free them from the planet go read the un go read julian huxley go read the visionaries
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:43.480]  of this modern system go read Kurzweil and they're so delusional they think they're going to create
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:52.040]  lucifer they're atheists that don't believe in god and the devil but they go ahead and say i worship
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:57.720]  lucifer like the head of the liberal movement sololensky dedicated his book to lucifer
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:06.440]  but they believe they're building lucifer because humans can envision and build whatever
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:11.720]  they imagine with enough time and energy and they've got seven and a half billion of us wired
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:17.160]  into their system manipulating us our labor our energy to get all our technology all of our brain
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:23.560]  trust and steal it to build some beast computer they're going to merge with and fly off overall
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:28.840]  that's the greatest threat that the people running the world hate humanity say we're ugly we're all
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:35.560]  mentally ill we have no free will there is no god and then behind the scenes few of them are atheists
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:43.160]  like Kurzweil but behind the scenes i've never found one of them that doesn't say i love the devil
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:49.560]  and i'm gonna live forever and i'm gonna have unlimited power you'll never help the general
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:56.360]  public or a bunch of dumb scum jokes join us and get the power you want the power don't you hear
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.720]  we can create a state-of-the-art rail system which takes lots off the road
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:09.480]  last week live trucking dot com posted this clip of bernie sanders bragging about new
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:15.000]  innovations in rail technology that will take big rigs off the road the article from early march
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.120]  poses the question will the trucking industry be significantly downsized under a sanders presidency
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:24.520]  most sanders critics focus on his socialist domestic economic plan and bernie makes no
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.080]  secret that he intends to raise taxes on everyone yet on top of bernie's socialist programs there
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:33.960]  are the draconian environmental policies he is proposing carbon taxes and carbon offsets are a
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:38.520]  centerpiece of the earth worship religion in addition societies must build vast collectivist
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:43.080]  infrastructures for instance bernie sanders discusses a new type of rail system that will
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.160]  take trucks off the road and the truck drivers along with the statement made by sanders and
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.800]  others like him it's just a small glimpse into what this new slave utopia will look like rob

[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:39.240]  back to your phone calls uh justin and elijah sam scott ryan we're going to everybody right now
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.680]  what is the biggest issue facing humanity how do we counter it
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:48.520]  that's the question and we've got a big announcement coming up concerning obama at
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:53.160]  the bottom of the hour stay with us for that obviously and and so much other news i want to
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.520]  get to uh some of the big news if you just joined us foreign governments dump us dead at record rate
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.560]  federal reserve says they're not going to raise interest rates now they're going to continue
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:07.080]  qe basically uh because of economic slowdown around the world most of the world is plunging
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:14.360]  into a depression and country's now dumping us dollars us treasuries at an accelerated rate
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:21.160]  is very very serious situation let's go to justin and canada justin thank you for calling welcome
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:28.920]  hey thanks for taking my call alex thank you brother go ahead okay so the most uh most threatening
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:34.440]  thing to the whole planet is that there is no saving it the global elite they have the red
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:39.320]  button i'm talking about mayday have you heard anything about this uh it's an online psi off
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:47.080]  going on right now uh no i haven't just explain it to me okay so it started actually it's interesting
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.320]  because the first day that you started commenting saying that your spidey senses were tingling
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:57.080]  was the first day that this started going around online where mayday just like 9 11
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:02.040]  where they use a distress a distress call apparently that's the day that everybody's
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.920]  looking at now this is supposed to i i like to think that i have a pretty good intuition whenever
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.800]  they do these little online psi ops and you know try and get you to react and get violent to this
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.080]  or anything but this one i'll look into it i mean certainly the globalists use it as 9 11
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.240]  means you know call the government for help emergency but also it means it's the government
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:27.320]  number uh so there if it has double meanings mayday is an occultic day where they would carry out uh
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:34.440]  springtime human sacrifice rituals uh obviously in in uh druidic europe uh and then that's what
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.440]  was adopted in the french revolution and then adopted by the communist uh and then now they've
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:44.040]  kind of pop-cultured it where oh dance around the maypole and all this you know for kids ha ha ha
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:49.800]  it's so cute you know halloween ghosting goblins he really it's you know a shallow one human
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:56.200]  sacrifice night so yes this is all going on uh and i didn't know that that there's a hype
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:03.080]  uh out there that they're saying mayday they did the fake been lying killing on mayday they have
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:09.240]  pulled a lot of weird stuff on mayday so i'd watch that date i'll go ahead uh yeah so it
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:14.200]  points to the jihadis in europe and it's it's you know it's one of these the same kind of thing
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:19.800]  the scare tactic of washington dc london rome paris targets in belgium were specifically
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:26.280]  mentioned uh so it's all about going on on the zero hour of isolated attacks that are all timed
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:30.680]  you know how they failed to do that on 9 11 they wanted it all timed up sure so instead they brought
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:36.200]  in five million into europe and it's got to be a million in the u.s i mean they say it's 200
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:43.000]  dollar taxes it's 200 at one high school okay yes so probably a million they brought in who knows
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.920]  and a lot of them are sleeper cells that's admitted uh you're saying you're worried they're
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:51.560]  going to just have coordinated g hot attacks and then the logical answer will be take the american
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.640]  people's guns and blame the tea party because that's what they do whenever the jihadis attack
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.520]  of course it's not logic but that's what they do is that what you're saying is that what
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:03.080]  folks are saying is there's a big g hot attack and uh the al-qaeda folks are online
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:10.920]  shooting their mouths off about mayday um yes and no mayday is coming from whoever's in control of
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.240]  these uh you know these political forum websites so that's where you got to take it with a grain
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:22.120]  of salt but as far as america goes the washington dc plot apparently has more to do with russia
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:27.960]  sneaking bomb-grade nuclear material to jihadi buyers which is supposed to kick off a war with
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:34.040]  russia even though it doesn't look like they are setting it up as much as you know as much as it
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:39.160]  seems like they want to because of trump and shirt but that's their red button right right
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:43.880]  points here's what i know elites are digging in billionaires are moving to the middle of nowhere
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.080]  they're building giant armor redoubts and the ozarks it's just all over the news now
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.560]  and big stuff's coming and yes if they would launch chemical attacks on the syrian government
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.360]  and then blame the syrian government absolutely they're claiming the russians are selling
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:07.880]  fissile material to jihadis uh and then if we get nuked oh russia did it now we're gonna have a war
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:14.600]  with russia it's an unprecedented time to be alive because they don't want to have a total world
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:19.480]  meltdown which we're on the verge of and not have some political distraction of a war or a terror
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:27.480]  attack and that's why in my gut i am just sick with anticipation and sick trying to figure out
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:33.400]  what's going on and to warn people and to stop it i i just you can see the preparations you can see
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:40.760]  the craziness and you can feel it great points great points uh let's go ahead and talk to sam
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:47.560]  then elijah sam thank you for calling from georgia hey alex how are you today i'm doing all right my
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:54.040]  friend what do you think is the uh is the big issue facing us well i think one of the things
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:58.200]  by the way i just want to thank you for a great program and being the tip of the spear and you
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:04.840]  remind me of a great blacksmith who made the best sword in the county and decided to teach everyone
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:10.600]  how to make their own so everyone could be protected who was that great blacksmith i don't
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.880]  know i'm just saying a great blacksmith exactly that's what it's all about imagine a blacksmith
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.320]  that didn't want to teach other people because he wanted all the business for himself and it was all
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:24.520]  a secret then that little town dies but the towns that you see that were successful around the world
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:29.000]  is where somebody like a great blacksmith decided to train everybody then it becomes the center
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  of blacksmithing then silversmiths goldsmiths come in then business begins then opportunity and that's
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:42.200]  the difference between a parasite economy and a liberator economy is the globalist want people
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:47.400]  in little plantations sectionate housing living off the government horrible lives the government
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:55.080]  ships the drugs into control them they don't want to have that empowerment it's so evil and that's
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:01.720]  so true now what i wanted to point out was that the way that they want to attack people is with
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.600]  the slow kill so it doesn't look so obvious and i think because they're controlling the media so
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:12.280]  much we're kind of looking at this great point and everyone worries about the great nuclear threat
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:17.720]  as far as wars but there's a great nuclear threat throughout the whole world from nuclear power plants
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:24.360]  in particular i wanted to point out the indian point nuclear power plant in fairfield county and
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:30.360]  there's also millstone nuclear plant in waterford counties these are counties that are right outside
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:35.000]  of manhattan uh you know right off long island those are absolute prime targets for somebody to
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.840]  drive through the front gate with a truck full of explosives well they're already been leaking
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:47.880]  tremendous amount of strontium 90 into the water for over 20 30 years uh they're looking at the
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:53.480]  bodies of deceased children and older people oh i know this elite is so evil that all over the
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.400]  world they just don't even care of reactors leak now they turn the alarms off and just let everybody
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.640]  get radiated and they're building more and mom be hot you know that writes for the guardian says he
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:07.320]  loves it he said in all environmentalists must support nuclear power this they're insane good
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:12.520]  points i appreciate your call let's jam one more in here alijah alijah in missouri thank you for
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:19.400]  calling today yes alex thank you for taking my call and uh i think uh one of the biggest threats is
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:26.600]  yes the agenda for social engineering of the global elites is ever successful um and it's
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.720]  kind of ironic that they try to blame donald trump and say he's dividing everyone but really that's
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:36.760]  their agenda that's totally weaponized divide and conquer media and then they say donald trump's
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:42.920]  doing it all right and i have a comment about uh donald trump's campaign the pundits have been
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:47.160]  saying that uh that the donald trump nomination could negatively affect republican senators
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:54.520]  running for reelection um in the 2016 uh senate's you know the 34 seats after grabs and i was thinking
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:59.800]  what if mr trump were to announce that he'll be endorsing uh possible you know candidates for those
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.600]  seats oh absolutely he's brought record numbers of people into the party and as soon as he's the
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:09.720]  nominee he'll only get more support and he can go out there on a reconciliation tour and really
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:16.600]  counter you know all these people uh and and they are just scared to death uh they get up there and
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:21.240]  try to sell all day the republicans are killing their party the globalists took over the republican
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:25.800]  party 50 something years ago they've run it in the ground they're killing it there is no real
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.840]  opposition and the people that have stolen our political system are scared to death right now
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:35.480]  that somebody real might get in there even if it's an ego maniac that flies around with gold
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:40.920]  plated toilet seats i mean i'll tell trump that and he's ridiculous he knows it too he's orange
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.800]  hair orange head loves gold i watched we watched the videos for entertainment around here like
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:50.360]  this is our jet and this is our palace and whatever at least they want to kill everybody
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.160]  and if the elite hate that maniac i love him all right uh great points uh elijah we'll be back

[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:24.760]  elites who think they're invincible and infallible to maintain control
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:31.480]  and everything else of that is just a derivative but obviously thermal nuclear war is a big threat
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:39.720]  genetic engineered crops splicing the wrong way giving rise to super super viruses super microbes
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:47.640]  super bacteria nanotech we are reaching up towards that Atlantean moment whether Atlantis
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:55.880]  exists or not we are accelerating towards a time where our technology becomes so powerful
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.560]  and our elites so reckless with their random testing
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.080]  that a disaster will happen
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:14.360]  as we move towards the singularity artificial intelligence so many other issues and I'm not
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:22.120]  being negative here I'm raising all these issues so that we can hopefully have a cultural species
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.160]  planetary wide debate about the real world humanity's not going to make it of the establishment
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:36.280]  it dumps everybody down for management purposes because the elite are corrupt and sociopathic
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.440]  and psychopathic and sadistic on average the general public's being turned into a bunch of
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:48.280]  dumb animals and there's a feedback loop between the two groups and the best laid plans of mice
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:56.360]  and men often go astray and that's happening right now look at all the other dictators and
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.320]  elites thought they had it all figured out and they did things go real well for them till they don't
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:08.520]  scout scout calling from arizona thank you for holding go ahead you're on the year
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:15.160]  hey how's it going good i just wanted to bring a little attention to uh kind of donald trump
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:21.480]  in his campaign with the i tried to pinpoint one thing because we're being attacked on so many fronts
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:28.200]  but it feels like he might have been put in there to create that division and i'm i'm a donald trump
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:35.880]  fan but sure they may be hyping this whole thing to create division and using him as an unwitting
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:43.320]  participant exactly and that tension you watch all the tension rising that's probably a lead up
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:49.640]  towards our civil war our racial war so well we know george soros and the un and the bill
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.360]  mulligan gates foundation and all of them are trying it and they've got big you know anti-trump

[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:47.960]  talk about i listened to your facebook mentioned last weekend with larry nickles when he was in the
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:55.160]  hospital and uh he was talking about the patriot enabler act that which is the executive order
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:01.560]  that obama just signed and he was talking about things we can do to stop that which brings in the
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:07.880]  un on these you know federally managed land things like that oh i mean it's in associated press that
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:14.200]  the un will basically run our local governments and make sure our police aren't bad oh the un's
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:20.120]  here to save us aren't they sweet foreign occupation just being eased in like a camel's
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:26.840]  nose under the tent flow right so are we talking to congressman about maybe trying to stop that
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:32.280]  because step here like 25 days to put a stop to it is it well i mean look they implement this stuff
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:38.200]  and then nothing happens overnight it takes them time to sell this we we expose it we say no to it
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.480]  they can put on paper all day long that they can round up veterans and gun owners and you
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:50.200]  know do this let's see them try that's why they want to get a big crisis going first and they'll say
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:56.440]  we're arresting the black lives matter leadership remember how the feds pushed occupy and then arrested
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:03.720]  them all so who knows what the longer term plan is uh but then they get conservatives to go good
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:09.400]  arrest those black lives matter communist and then next it's yes and right wingers like the
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:15.560]  bundies and yes the veterans groups this militia was planning this and that they're scripting the
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:22.760]  rollout of a war against the american people but they thought waco was a group that was weird or
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:28.040]  kooky that they could sell that idea of tanks attacking a church people got mad across the board
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:33.080]  so the globalists have twisted brains they're smart they have a lot of data
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.200]  but they have blind spots and and they also just like to do evil stuff so they they just can't help

[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:43.400]  into iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction it turns out he didn't but he
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:48.680]  had the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction but also talked about the human suffering in iraq
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:54.120]  hello boys and girls i have a special message for you from the president of the united states
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:59.160]  i salute the boys and girls who are buying united states saving stamps and bonds and they're giving
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:05.560]  important support to the cause of freedom and the men who fight for us in vietnam the congress
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:15.720]  gives us authority in august 1964 to do whatever may be necessary that's pretty far reaching
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.400]  that's the sky is the limits as an american citizen you have to respect our president

[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:44.600]  i will support whatever decision he makes music it is a hard fact that us strikes have

[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:06.120]  he didn't even say goodbye he didn't take the time to lie the united states knows
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:10.680]  that iraq has weapons of mass destruction well the first things they told me was
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:16.840]  you're not even to acknowledge the drone program you're not even to discuss that it exists renewed

[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:31.960]  required me to order the military forces of the united states to take action and reply
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:43.080]  that reply is crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio

[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:23.240]  nobody has pushed this more and given cover to war like it's some humanitarian thing than

[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:07.400]  to the nobel prize they've given some good people the nobel prize but now it's a true
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:13.240]  joke to get it so i also want to give him not just the new nobel prize but i want to give him this
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:21.080]  uh plastic bling uh you know dollar sign og uh situation because again it's all about

[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:55.960]  over 400 000 now i kept saying 300 000 in syria and our government with nato helped start the whole
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.920]  thing so i brought some of the crew and whoever whoever wanted a piece of this uh cake uh leon

[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.800]  a million we wanted to put that extra candle it probably is a million too exactly that's
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:37.720]  old number that we know well so here's the killing a million people yeah yeah hey oh obama so let's
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.040]  let's give him another nobel prize community organizer and i'm giving him this one what
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.360]  what are we going to call this the original gangster prize oh gee this is for being really
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:51.160]  good at killing people that's right and he says he's really good at killing people he said it
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:56.760]  is your mic on i don't know when i walked in okay good just i talked right into it again this is
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:01.720]  just impromptu i thought get this cake made the other day uh and i think h.e.b i did a great job
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:07.160]  on that i think h.e.b made it didn't they yes okay so they're complicit and i think he even got
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:12.120]  high fructose corn syrup in it we wanted it to be a you know unhealthy cake uh like all of this
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:19.080]  and so this is a truly blasphemous uh situation because it is all a joke the nobel prize is a
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:23.560]  joke uh it's all a joke so anybody that wants to get on that mic and make comments i mean
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.640]  i mean right when he was elected he didn't even do anything and he got the nobel prize
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:32.680]  and then he ended up killing a million almost a million people but listen i deserves another one
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:38.840]  i get a nobel prize everybody gets one yeah they're just passing on everybody i deserve it i just
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:44.280]  think it's amazing the number of troops killed in afghanistan is 75 of the total troop deaths
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:48.920]  or since obama took office you know what i want i want to nominate hitler for a nobel
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:55.000]  peace prize stalin mal gingis kahn uh and fidel kastrow while we're at it i mean why not why not
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.920]  how about poll pot hillary clinton she says she's really we came we saw we bought libya we have the
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.000]  picture of libya before and after yeah joking on the mic here you were saying it's a really great
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:11.880]  great place hillary for prison hillary for nobel peace prize let's do it well again i didn't want

[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:20.840]  want to put the headline out with this video as soon as we can just obama given another nobel
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:25.160]  peace prize and ours is just as real and just as authentic as theirs because they've given them to
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:33.320]  henry kissinger al gore it is now a sign that you are a war criminal uh just an absolutely horrible
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:42.680]  evil person we can stop flashing now i think i'm about to die 900 exactly 995 000 in programming
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:47.640]  with the blinking yeah that was uh that was my idea like it's a bad video game finish screen you
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:51.000]  know you're finished with the video game you're almost done and that screen flies it's awesome
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.200]  to and he and he's sitting on a pile of skulls we can just freeze it with the pile of skulls uh back
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:01.080]  there so there you have it of course dr peonka ut got a standing ovation of the texas academy of
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:06.120]  sciences eight years ago it's an in game when he got up with a huge projection of red skulls and said
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:10.120]  soon we're gonna have airborne Ebola i'm ready to die with my family humans are evil this is a good
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:15.000]  thing and so this is really their attitude overall but but guys who wants to chime in though

[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:23.240]  and kill a billion people yeah that's the queen of england's husband that's right a prince philip
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:28.040]  prince philip he said that in three books yeah and a bunch of magazines but he's just kidding he's
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:32.760]  just joking around you know he really doesn't want to kill a billion people they want to kill
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.600]  five billion people yeah but he is he's a big supporter bill one again they wanted to take
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:44.040]  that shot uh day to night uh mcbrain and josh let me just say only in today's orwellian society
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:49.160]  would would someone like obama get a no-bill peace prize you know for doing nothing i mean
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:54.840]  outrageously he got it i mean who who is this i'm giving him now he gets an old bell peace prize
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:57.560]  i'm giving him this for making our economy the best it's ever been remember he said that our
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:03.000]  economy is the best it's ever been yes well on that point and and along that line alex there's
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.440]  been a million people who've lost their jobs since nafta of course we can't blame that on obama he
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.840]  campaign said he was going to get rid of nafta uh that's a bipartisan effort so i guess when he
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:17.720]  accepts this then he needs to give some credit to the people who helped him and the gop as well the
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:22.920]  establishment leaders and both yes i wonder if he will accept our noble peace price because i mean
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:27.320]  at least it's not being given to henry kissinger i think this one is actually worth more than the
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:35.400]  noble committee what do you think it's yeah it looks more delicious yeah absolutely well good
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:38.920]  job everybody and again i don't normally pull stunts saying big announcement coming up and
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:44.600]  we do this but uh it's truly sickening when you look at this because it's a joke they gave him
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.760]  the prize and we're not really joking about all these dead people it's it's horrible but the
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:53.560]  american people seem to think it's like another planet over there that this is happening our
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:58.200]  government put the jihadis in and now 400 plus thousand people according to right lands that
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:02.920]  and others have died uh in syria no one was dying before this happened they try to blame Assad
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:07.640]  they admit the vast majority are al-qaeda and isis killing people including the genocide of christians
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:13.240]  the christians yeah that the isis has killed over 170 000 christians and shiites since and i that's
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:16.280]  just in iraq too that's not even the other countries because they don't even know the
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:20.120]  numbers in the other countries because just the way things are our government with saudi arabia
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:26.440]  has financed it aided and armed a shuni jihad to take over the entire region jovix what do you
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.960]  think they're doing that i'm gonna run the mic back over there i mean yesterday i went out and did
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.520]  a video a man on the street out at south by southwest asking people who hate muslims more
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:40.040]  obama clinton or trump and everyone automatically just said trump completely ignoring the fact that
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:45.960]  donald trump opposed both wars in iraq and afghanistan and also i brought up the fact of the drone
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:50.120]  kills by obama how they've gone up since he's been in office and those are just like children
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:54.440]  about the each one's a hundred thousand kids you know do they just blow them out like it's no big
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:59.320]  deal you know bill marr says kill more people murder or suicide just get the highway moving
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:04.520]  of course his life matters those sorry jov go ahead yeah so i mean people didn't seem to concern
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:10.200]  that obama and clinton had been involved in all these uh uh you know murders and people were just
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:15.080]  more concerned about the fact that don trump wanted to build a wall and that means he hates uh muslims
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:19.640]  and these races so i just thought that was a but exactly let's go through some more of these slides
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:23.480]  so that's a hundred seventy thousand people mostly christians kill biases in iraq alone
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:30.840]  400 000 uh in syria in the last five years uh we've got a libyan civil war 20 000 and it's
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:38.680]  way above that iraq deaths since obama 375 000 uh 1 700 troops killed in afghanistan since obama
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:46.040]  took over 17 000 uh wounded uh we've got um five thousand that he ordered killed himself with drones
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.520]  most of them in and again if you even do this why would he say he's good at killing he's really
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.440]  good at killing i'm really good at killing in fact we'll get that clip after the break but
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:58.440]  anybody else want to pop in about just this incredible leader yeah i mean war in itself
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:02.840]  is health of the state i mean remember yesterday with the economists coming out saying that trump
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:08.120]  was a global threat to humanity just as bad as isis but then you got hillary clinton that over
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:13.320]  through libya goddafi in libya gave the country over to isis then you got they have the people
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:19.080]  that that that put isis in and al qaeda telling us trumps al qaeda right and then you got nafta
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:22.920]  that's basically created this whole immigration problem that we have because now a lot of millions
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.160]  of mexicans only have jobs which are sitting corn and whatnot down into mexico government
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.400]  subsidized corn so now they're fleeing over here so they're just creating this whole global
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:36.600]  instability they admit they use every selective deal to absolutely screw everyone over and
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:40.200]  consolidate power david night anything well i just want to add the two slides the one of
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:46.120]  mistrata which is in libya showing that you know the before and after and then the shot of in syria
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.760]  showing this whole area of town that's just been totally destroyed so there's there's libya right
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:54.760]  there before and after you know you could you could see all the good we've done there all the
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:00.040]  spreading of freedom that's going on right there and then go to the one in uh in uh syria
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:04.040]  showing the syrian the background image is amazing look here's a a normal looking
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:08.840]  newt neighborhood now watch it transform look at that nothing it's been snuffed out that's right for

[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:21.160]  point out the people in these countries they know who's behind this too when you when you because
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:25.400]  there's interviews with people that are there and they know that it's it's western intelligence
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:29.880]  and they say obama stop sending al qaeda to kill us you you give them weapons why
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.880]  are you so they might they might be pulling people here in the united states but they're
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:38.840]  not fooling anybody out there in the middle east well we're eating obama's nobel peace prize here
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:43.960]  his death cake and remember hillary clinton's friend madeline albright who said that it was
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:48.520]  worth the death of a half million children with the sanctions under the first clinton
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:53.000]  administration of course she's there with hillary pushing her telling everybody you know if you
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.240]  don't vote for her because she's a woman you're a bad person but of course you know where is the
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:03.080]  uh this is a woman who doesn't have a problem with the death of a half million people uh children
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:07.640]  should say in fact let's add those let's take this video right now before the show ends we can
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:11.640]  and let's put the obama i'm good at killing people hillary she's good at killing people
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.680]  you know i came i saw he died and then let's put the albright clip you know in here so folks see
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:21.480]  just really how great all these folks are we're not just singling obama out uh even though he's
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:26.280]  launched a bunch of wars it's that he got a peace prize folks that it's just how stupid this is so
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:29.720]  what do you guys think of the idea seriously i'm trying to illustrate this i mean i think it's been
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:38.680]  successful i mean i think a lot of americans unfortunately they don't read read enough
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:42.920]  international news sources a lot of the stuff that i find out about obama's drone strikes are from
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:49.400]  like not just bbc but also kind of middle eastern russian it's where they bomb sometimes a wedding

[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:24.840]  course uh has death on his finger and i'm not saying he's a bad guy he believed when he was
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:30.040]  doing at the time he said no i i want a peace prize too i did it uh and so he's here i thought we'd
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:33.560]  give him a peace prize too so we have another one doesn't matter if it doesn't look like the old
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:37.800]  one the whole thing's a fraud to begin with ours is just as real as the nobel committees so joe
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:41.480]  biggs come on up here my friend uh let's uh put it right in front of the cake where we have the
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:47.800]  document cam uh yeah says death on your trigger finger and so we will now bestow not you but
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:55.720]  your finger because it says death a peace prize there you go a lot dun dun dun it's just as joe
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:02.680]  biggs his finger his finger joe biggs trigger finger award the nobel death death gets a we
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:09.000]  should give an obel peace prize to death absolutely or the god of war let's give mars a peace prize

[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:19.320]  exactly well actually that can bring peace to defend you but no to the god of war mars
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:25.720]  we give you the another peace prize i can just hand out all i want all right closing comments
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:30.600]  leon uh you wanted to say something too uh over there kid Daniel well i also just really love
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:35.720]  getting lectured by obama about gun control and when then he goes and sells billions of dollars
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:40.600]  worth of weapons to all these or how christians are hateful on easter yeah after he attacked christians
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.360]  on easter so i wonder how he'll hike his leg this year yeah i mean what are we gonna do when he's
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:50.200]  no longer in office to lecture us about that you know they actually have a constitution at one of
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:55.000]  the memorials they actually caught obama in there like a two a.m. peeing on it like it was a fire
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.520]  hydrant like aziaz born did to the alama yes i'm joking but that sounds like something you did i
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:06.040]  mean you know we're now doing satire we have that exclusive video leon anything else well i just
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:10.040]  can't wait what do we have another eight months eight more months to go well those numbers are
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:13.960]  a few months old so it's well over a million this really celebrates a million dead i mean
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:18.440]  he you know for him because that's when you get a peace prize we don't celebrate well i think they
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:23.720]  would say looking back it was worth it it was worth it kid is this in bad taste what i'm doing i mean
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:26.840]  it's it's not bad for obama to kill the people but it's bad to make fun of him i'm sure there'll
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:30.680]  be a media matter what's disgusting is that media matters the media will attack you for this but
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:34.840]  they won't attack obama for drone strike and little innocent children and women what not
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:40.280]  why are you racist oh well i'm guessing but he did cry for those kids i mean he had his
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:45.160]  kitty oh from uh from family hook yeah i just can't calm us get the good i'm failing
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:52.680]  my husband is gonna beat me tonight michelle not the kids i killed with my drone strikes not
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:57.240]  those kids they don't count the collateral damage this whole peace prize it kind of shows how the
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.720]  establishment prays on the ignorance of the population because i think it was cindy she and
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:06.120]  i went to an event that she did a couple years ago she told me the anti-war movement completely
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:11.000]  disappeared once obama got in office but obama has done exactly what bush would have continued
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.360]  doing if he stayed in office oh that was the whole point where is the left man about bernie
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:17.720]  sanders having the elections stolen from him they admit and now the republicans say they're
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:22.040]  going to steal the delegates as well all right well great job crew we're going to post this video so
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:27.000]  radio listeners can see it in the next couple hours with the little clips of albright saying
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:33.560]  500 000 kids is a good price to pay and everybody's good at killing people but i know for veterans
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:37.880]  and soldiers who had to do what they had to do they're not into bragging about killing joe
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:43.800]  you know for you who's a veteran combat vet is it obnoxious to see somebody like hillary talking
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.800]  about how good she is at killing people and how tough she is and like brian william saying she's
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:52.520]  in all this combat i mean i'd like to see her actually go do it i don't think she has a guts
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:56.920]  to actually do it she's a college she's in the back she makes a command and she has other people
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:00.920]  do it that's how she's able to sleep at night i'd like to see someone like that who brags about
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.040]  actually go out there and do it i don't think she'd have the guts now you know full metal jacket
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:09.640]  when he says to gulmer polly goes i bet if there was something up on top that obstacle you'd get
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:12.840]  up there well i thought it was a hot checkup on top the obstacle she could get up there
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:18.760]  i bet hillary could carry a 75 pound pack 20 miles if there was marilamon row at the other end
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:25.320]  i'm only saving graces do you think she goes for marilamon row type i'd say janet rino or
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:28.200]  someone's yeah no you're right i don't know she goes for women that look like lizards
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:34.760]  mm-hmm like her i don't mean to be mean it's just true she's fair game hey obama good job

[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:58.520]  good talk to you man thank you brother thank you hey um my my concern is the racial racial division
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:05.080]  in in the country you know they're they're the black lives matters to me seems like they're on purpose
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:12.200]  trying to um put all the progress that martin luther king was trying to absolutely just horrible
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:17.640]  racist hateful people everywhere and then that makes the groups they're actually trying to reform
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:22.920]  police departments look bad associated with them they're just horrible and and and even
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:29.480]  meghan kelly gets up on tv and endorses them now can you believe that yeah it's crazy i mean he he
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:35.640]  promoted nonviolent you know they had they walked our arms locked together but not through crowds
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:42.520]  trying to um start conflict getting punched in the face just so they can yell racism you know um
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:48.440]  well i mean imagine walking into some random restaurant and you start going racism racism
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:55.560]  racism i mean actually go protest the klan or something or go protest at the prisons or something
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:00.200]  you know that have been proven to be given unfair sentencing on race i mean a target the real stuff
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:05.240]  not just run out and just tell some liberal group so many liberals have talked about how
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:09.560]  they're confronted and told their racists and it's a breaking point but imagine you pay the senior
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:14.360]  kids to college and a third of the time now they have sensitivity training where you go in a room
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:19.320]  and get yelled at because you're white or yelled at because you're a man and let's not forget it's
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:24.280]  not just black versus white and all this stuff they are teaching that men are inherently bad i mean
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:29.560]  it's just crazy but this is how you screw a society up what else are you concerned about
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:36.760]  well we're you wanted to at your you asked us we had a solution well i'm here in longview
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:43.400]  texas saying i just recently got a position in a um african-american church i'm a white man
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:49.960]  a white man and this is a 136 year old african-american church that wants to integrate and do something
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:57.400]  and show people that um the we want to unite and do something great for our country and they
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:03.960]  want me to help start teaching their children that um that they can be taught by a white man
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:08.360]  and be preached to well that's awesome because what the control left us is they go no white savers no
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:14.680]  whites no you know safe places no whites they're creating segregation again and it's it's because
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:19.240]  again they want people in groups they control and if folks want to segregate themselves that's their
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:25.240]  issue you know that's that's freedom you're allowed to do what you want but they're forcing
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:31.800]  segregation into a race cult for total control you want to shoot a video about that sometime
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:36.280]  once you have some progress and we'd have you on as a guest very very interesting there will be a
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:42.360]  backlash against the democratic party trying to create total racial division there are being you
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:47.400]  know a lot of churches you know that are mixed churches black white you name it that are doing
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:52.360]  just what you said and who see through it so it's an amazing time to be alive more calls coming up
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:56.840]  and Dr. Jerome Corsi on the Donald Trump phenomenon and more as well as the economy
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:03.640]  we can create a state-of-the-art rail system which takes trucks off the road
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:10.040]  last week live trucking.com posted this clip of Bernie Sanders bragging about new innovations
[02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:15.480]  in rail technology that will take big rigs off the road the article from early march poses the
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:20.280]  question will the trucking industry be significantly downsized under a Sanders presidency most
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:24.920]  Sanders critics focus on his socialist domestic economic plan and Bernie makes no secret that
[02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:29.320]  he intends to raise taxes on everyone yet on top of Bernie's socialist programs there are the
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:34.520]  draconian environmental policies he is proposing carbon taxes and carbon offsets are a centerpiece
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:39.240]  of the earth worship religion in addition societies must build vast collectivist infrastructures
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:44.040]  for instance Bernie Sanders discusses a new type of rail system that will take trucks off the road
[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:48.280]  and the truck drivers along with them the statement made by sanders and others like him is just a

[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:38.680]  to that but paul if you just listen to this opi i can't listen paul you're racing a tape that's
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:47.160]  what i mean to do you bug the conversation between a lawyer and his client now that's violating one
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:56.920]  of the most sacred rights of privacy but paul no buts but if it helps the law opi the law can't
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:06.040]  use this kind of help ladies and gentlemen think how far as a nation we've fallen where in public
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:11.400]  schools across the country they're saying don't use the word he or she or mother and father it
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:17.640]  hurts someone but the government can spy on you and spy on congress and it's not even the government
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:23.400]  it's just corporations and contractors and bureaucracies foreign banks own and control our
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:30.440]  federal reserve the communist chinese tell hollywood what they can and can't put movies they get books
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:37.240]  spiked and the communist chinese biggest murders in history came out yesterday in the people's daily
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:43.800]  official government publications said donald trump is racist and hitler these are people this is a
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:51.560]  government that killed conservatively four times what adolf hitler killed they are the world champion
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:58.360]  killers and you've got the pope and everybody else it's crazy when trump is just talking about
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:03.400]  common sense things like don't bring muslims in if you're not vetting them it stops till you fix it
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:10.920]  or yeah we can't have open borders dr jerome coursey as a phd from harvard university political
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:16.280]  science he's currently senior staff writer at world net daily dot com where he works as an
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:20.520]  investigative reporter he's a number one new york times bestseller i think three or four times in

[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:01.640]  services journals and magazines to run coursey dot com is his private site and the reason i'm
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:09.480]  focusing in on that today is he really is one of the top experts on finance on banks on the economy
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:15.880]  he's better known for all his political bestselling books and for his his journalism but he really is
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:22.920]  uh you're the expert when it comes to banking but also a terrorist hostage situations he's a
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:26.680]  smart cookie because when i hear him on other shows sometimes people just say doctor doctor

[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:55.000]  the geopolitical developments around the world why did russia pull out of syria

[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:21.400]  tackle first well they're all really important issues and important questions so you take your
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:28.120]  pick i mean we can start with donald trump uh i have um been very close to donald trump over the
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:33.480]  years i mean i've known donald trump for maybe 40 years uh going back to the plaza hotel when he
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:39.480]  owned it and i think it's i've said from the beginning uh donald trump is the real deal
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:48.360]  he's tapping into a tremendous dissatisfaction of the majority of americans what used to be called
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:55.160]  under president nixon the silent majority uh who are disaffected with both parties are not
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:59.160]  happy with the democrats at all as the democrats become increasingly
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:05.800]  socialist bill a or socialist and or communist i mean birdie sanders a good indication of that
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:12.920]  and um unhappy with the g.o.p establishment in washington the john bainers and the mitch mcconnell's
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:20.600]  so the tea party group has really abandoned the republican party establishment in dc and
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:28.360]  abandoned washington altogether this is a a realignment of the electorate which happens
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:33.240]  every 40 or 50 years and it's undergoing right now it's an historic moment in time
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:39.880]  the last one i think happened in 1968 when richard nixon implemented the
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:46.440]  southern strategy and people forget that the democratic party uh controlled the south and
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:53.560]  was segregationist uh even after the before the civil war and after the civil war uh the clueless
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:59.480]  plan was democratic it was the republicans and eisenhower introduced the first civil rights
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:07.800]  legislation in 68 the conservatives in the south abandoned the democratic party and then began to
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:13.960]  bond with richard nixon the republican party south is today much more of a republican enclave
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:19.000]  that was a realignment we're going to another realignment this realignment has nothing to do
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:25.960]  with geography it's a fundamental middle america reaction against both the extreme left of the
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:32.760]  democrats and the establishment republicans in washington dc and it won't easily be reversed
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:39.000]  and trump is going to continue to gain i think all the way to the 1237 delegates he needs to be
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  the nominee on the first ballot as a top political scientist not just one of these fluff pundits
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:52.280]  is the power structure arrogant thinking they can stop a major realignment you look at this realignment
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:56.840]  some believe it may be the biggest in modern history because the confluence of technology
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:03.160]  and other cascading events and if you study history any elite that tries to stop a realignment
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:10.600]  will cause explosive responses and it tends historically on almost every case correct me
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:18.520]  am i wrong to blow up in their face even worse well i think alex you're 100 right the the um
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:26.280]  for the establishment gop this is a fight to the death because the establishment gop knows
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:31.800]  that it's going to lose its privileges going to lose its money it's about money but you know k
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:41.560]  street consulting firms paying pundits in dc politicians getting rich by getting the
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:48.600]  intercom coming on apologize for that um it's okay it's a it's a fight to the death because
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:55.960]  the gop establishment is going to lose its privilege hold on money in dc and see what people
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:01.640]  have to understand is that when you really get to know the gop establishment in washington
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:07.000]  they're happy with the democratic president they weren't dissatisfied when obama won reelect
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.880]  that's why they say why are they so arrogant though to just mitch mcconnell we'll rather have
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:17.080]  hillary we don't care i mean why are they so obvious are they are they that disconnected
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:22.280]  yes they're that disconnected they don't understand that the what they view as privilege and status
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:27.960]  quo which is really you know the republicans to be in the establishment republicans have always
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:34.680]  been controlled by the multinational corporations going fellowship athletes brilliant book in the
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:42.200]  60s you know a choice not an echo which he wrote in the goldwater years and the rockefeller republicans
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:48.280]  was whom she was opposing were globalist supporters multinational corporations beyond
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:54.920]  borders happy to spend money happy to spend the federal treasury for welfare did not fundamentally
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:17:00.280]  disagree with the democratic party just one of themselves what would have america been like if
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:05.720]  the true libertarian patriot movement with very goldwater and slapley would have stopped them i
[02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:11.640]  mean it'd be amazing well we would have had a government much more of a country much closer
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:18.360]  to what our founders wanted limited government i mean if you're going to really reform washington
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:22.760]  you've got to destroy both parties and you got to start there wouldn't have been the social
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:28.840]  engineering to end the family i mean we've been sabotaged by design and this engineering this whole
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:36.120]  realignment is at the multinational corporations which don't want governments they want to have
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:42.600]  the corporations control all and the communists and socialists on the left which also want
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:47.320]  you know government to control all i mean i said from the beginning that when you go back to the
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:53.000]  roots of the republican party in modern roots and you see that you know that was the bush family
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:59.560]  prescott bush funding hitler uh it was john foster dollas and alan dollas working through
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:05.400]  brown brothers harrowman to fund hitler's rise that they were always happy with the nazi formula
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:11.240]  the nazi formula is multinational corporations rule and then there's a social welfare net
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:17.080]  for everybody else exactly it's socialism with fascism sitting on top precisely and
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:21.880]  that's the that's hitler's formation hitler was the first to have you know that really introduced
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:27.160]  this whole principle of universal health care the nazis felt like it was a great formula multinational
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:33.960]  corporations no borders endless war to kill the people that were needless and welfare for the ones
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:39.400]  you couldn't do anything else with so welfare and fascist government at the top controlled by
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:46.920]  corporations so the republican party gop leadership in washington took over the multinational corporation
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:53.160]  role of championing and the democratic party of the left took the underclass to champion
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:58.520]  and both parties were happy to sacrifice them in endless wars wow you just laid out the history of
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:04.440]  the last 70 years and here we are and they're fighting like the devil to stay in place dr
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:08.040]  coursey lay out what you think i'm gonna skip this break this is so important i can't help it
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:11.720]  lay out how you think they're gonna counter strike because we don't just see realignment here we see
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:17.160]  germany we see europe we see asia we see the exact same formulas that we know the big think tanks
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:22.040]  have developed to bring in the radical jihadis to bring in all these third world populations
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:28.520]  to have them be clients of the government and then when they attack logic's been suspended
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:34.520]  so we lose our rights and then merkel and halan and obama don't get in trouble when we have san
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:40.840]  bernadinos and theater attacks what's the political calculus there because it's clearly completely
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:44.760]  a methodology i mean they're following an exact carbon copy plan in each country
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:51.960]  it just seems so bold that and i think they're miscalculating because this is i think they still
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:55.960]  think that the public isn't understanding what's happening because they look at dumb
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:20:00.200]  down young people they look at dumb down you know some of the folks around them who are kind of
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:04.520]  yes men i don't think they realize that we're thinking people that are a giant minority
[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:10.200]  that there is a huge awakening happening for the fact that we have basically terminal cancer
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:16.520]  style government that no quarter will be given by either side i mean i think this is a hardening
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:20.360]  of the public they talk about balkanization where they want to come together for their agenda or
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:26.280]  they talk about how the country split well the people are splitting forever with the social
[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:32.200]  engineers well i think this is why shows like yours are so important you know your your huge
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:38.280]  audience over the years of listening and being educated have woken up to the fact that they're
[02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:43.880]  being manipulated left and right both political parties in fundamental agreement happy to have
[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:51.720]  obama elected happy to have a cia president sitting there george hw bush cia onward pre-trade
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:57.720]  deals that both parties agree on i agree with you i think alex this time it isn't going to work
[02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:02.760]  so i think people are increasingly catching on to it and of course what they're going to try
[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:08.920]  they've got to a very readily available techniques to try with your false flags and these other kinds
[02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:16.360]  of crises one is the dollar's been so debased and the world debt structure is so high that i think
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:23.240]  at any moment they could trigger another debt collapse and major world economic crisis and
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:27.960]  try to scare everybody they're going to lose their jobs lose their houses lose their families lose
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:34.520]  everything because the globalese can let there be another worldwide collapse of the financial
[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:41.880]  system that's number one number two is they could try another war structure major terrorist attack
[02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:47.800]  on the level of a 9-11 which will frighten everyone now push everybody closer into a
[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:53.480]  patriot act and have everybody quit thinking out of fear those are their only real two choices
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:22:00.120]  and both are easily in the works i think though the american public is beyond this i think the
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:05.800]  american public realizes that they're being manipulated and i think donald trump is articulating
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:12.200]  a strong campaign because he's not going to go along with the politically correct he's going
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:17.400]  to call it out for what it is and when donald trump trump starts laying into hillary clinton
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:21.960]  who y'all got a book coming out in july on hillary clinton and the foundation she's
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:26.920]  obviously a criminal and trump and his people are going to start saying i don't know why she
[02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:33.240]  isn't in jail he's already started this he's going to deconstruct her chapter by verse he's got names
[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:38.840]  i've got a whole series of articles i'm going to start publishing continuing publishing on the
[02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:47.800]  operatives the far left sorrows funded extremes groups like this zack xley working for sanders
[02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:53.800]  who is a you know communist operative who was planted in the carry campaign to start with
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:59.960]  and goes on and on sorrows funding these rent a group you know rent a mob that you're going to
[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:05.400]  see attacking trump continuously and imagine a novel where you've got a weirdo nazi collaborator
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:10.920]  who tries to overthrow governments constantly and is successful george sorrows running weirdo
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:17.880]  leftist groups who just randomly support shooting cops for no reason trying to start a civil war
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:23.960]  so they can bring in federal control openly saying they want this strong city's un initiative to
[02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:29.240]  make our local governments behave this is surreal and then weirdos like bill aires showing up at
[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:35.400]  the chicago attack on trump supporters and then meghan kelly is on tv today i saw the promos saying
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:40.280]  i'll talk to the activist and the protesters who were attacked by trump and had their free speech
[02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:46.920]  violated in chicago it is the inversion of reality and everybody's really showing who they are at this
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:54.040]  part of time and it does show how desperate they are do you think they know they're on their last
[02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:59.080]  legs or are they so delusional they think they can pull it out well i think well of course they have
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:04.200]  no choice but to try to pull it out because i said this was a fight to the death their corner
[02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:10.200]  they they they're they're caught you've called them out you know i've done my best to call them
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:18.680]  out others have this whole game of leadership establishment it's about power for power's
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:23.880]  sake that's sorrows and then it's about money it's about the fact that why is sorrows so horrible
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:28.200]  well why is he so evil they don't have any regard for human beings they don't have any regard for
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:33.640]  human values it's all about power it's all about money when you've got 90 million people in the
[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:39.240]  united states of america who can't find a job there's 90 million useless people that the elite
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:44.120]  of left and right would be happy to eliminate limited by disease eliminate the body and instead
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:47.960]  they're going to get us all fighting with each other on race and stuff well they create these
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:53.960]  issues it's so clear they're so evil i just i've studied history doctors you have i've never seen
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:25:00.840]  anything in history where where there's been such a twisted criminally insane group of elites in
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:05.080]  control because you say yeah it's all about just raw power it is but don't they see they're not
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:09.800]  going to have a world to spend all this money and power in if they keep screwing up the system
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:16.920]  it's never bothered them it's just pure beyond i mean how many billions of dollars do they need
[02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:21.640]  how many you know how many hundreds of millions of dollars that clinton's need to steal in their
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:27.960]  foundation there's never enough and what's different this time i believe alex is the people's eyes
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:33.880]  are getting open and they're seeing these games for as callous and manipulative and as evil as they
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:40.120]  are the protesters are going to be even more exposed than where the protesters in 1968 of the
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:46.600]  democratic convention it's going to turn against them because these are rent a protest these are
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:54.840]  official staged rehearsed actors who show up to protest with a line and are there not because
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:59.080]  they believe in anything but because they've been paid they've been motivated they've been given a
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:05.240]  printed sign as the george sorrows is are pumping billions of dollars into making sure that this
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:11.480]  sideshow diverts the attention gets the you know making kelly's of the world to
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:18.600]  parrot the wrong side and blame the victims to blame donald trump you know and it's people are
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:23.480]  going to see through it they are seeing through it people are understanding that you know once
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:28.920]  things have gotten to be this bad economically once the borders are this open you know so
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:34.440]  how are you going to scare people further nobody has jobs terrorists are being brought into the
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:39.560]  city's daily take a look at europe what is the bottom line plan because you have a sophisticated
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:45.880]  understanding of this it's clear for you looking its chaos and and the suspension of logic to be
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:51.560]  able to bring in jihadis and then be the hero when they attack and take the public's freedoms
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:55.560]  because the media won't report that they brought them in but the public and put two and two together
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:59.400]  what is the formula because i really do think they're going to hit us with sleeper cell attacks
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:04.280]  that may even be run by some of these sorrows type connected groups because you've seen sorrows with
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:09.240]  the arab spring sorrows with ukraine i mean we know he's a serious operator probably the worst
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:14.520]  the world's ever seen i mean a literal james bond villain and then when they attack i guess bring in
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:20.680]  a civil emergency uh or something like that because we're working on a story here right now where we've
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:25.720]  proven they're giving them social security numbers and new names they're bringing in jihadis who they
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:30.680]  know are terrorists and they're giving them section 8 housing and they're bringing in so many there are
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:36.520]  thousands of kids in austin from iraq and syria just last year and they claim it's only a couple
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:40.680]  hundred in all of texas the last year but they won't tell the governor's what i'm saying is dr
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:46.760]  coursing this is big it is big it's huge and it's important to keep exposing it because look every
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:53.480]  candidate democrat and republic accept donald trump you know you've got have supported free trade
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:28:03.000]  i you had crews voting for the trend the the tpa the trade the free fast track to be able to get
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:08.120]  this tpp through the trans-pacific partnership through congress caseage has supported every free
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:15.240]  trade he's ever seen you have hillary sanders they all agree about open borders they all agree we
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:19.880]  shouldn't attack or say anything about islamic terrorists they're all in agreement that we
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:23.720]  should have massive welfare and government spending government debt they're all for
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:29.160]  washington power the only one who says no is donald trump and that's why they have to destroy
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:35.080]  donald trump in order to preserve this illusion that we have a democracy that we're still anywhere
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:39.080]  near where you've known him 40 years you talked about it years ago he calls you up all the time on
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:44.040]  your home phone you know get your advice on things you advise him on one of the birth or stuff i mean

[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:34.600]  people out you know he's going to trust his own judgment and he's going to listen to a few close
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:39.400]  advisors but he's going to react on his own instincts which is the way he's made his entire life
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:43.720]  well what impresses me is that i know a lot of high-powered really smart guys that i respect

[02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:22.440]  dr corcy as a phd from harvard top of his class
[02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:31.880]  when it comes to geo politics he's a historian successful in business successful in counter
[02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:36.840]  terrorism really smart guy knows what he's talking about and you heard him a total realignment
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:44.680]  probably one of the biggest in history super dangerous also really advantageous if you know
[02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:49.800]  how to position yourself you can do that in a moral way and become extremely successful
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:54.840]  protect your wealth protect your family and the stuff we talk about here there's a reason foreign
[02:33:54.840 --> 02:34:00.040]  heads of state listen there's a reason we have all these high-powered guests on because yeah i yell
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:05.320]  and scream and there's some entertainment value to the show and i never intended to have a carnival
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:09.640]  flare that's just how i was i've been doing this since i was 21 so it's been an evolution
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:17.560]  but the lord works mysterious ways and we now have globally 25 26 million people a week that
[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:23.160]  tune in or watch or get the podcast most talk show hosts would be bummed out
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:29.080]  that less than half that global audience is here in the us we have a big audience here in the us
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:33.480]  big we have aggregators from all the different systems to know
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:41.160]  know that about 13 14 million of those people that routinely come through every week the sites all
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:46.360]  the platforms and then we can tell us different people it's in the united states and canada it's
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:50.920]  north america i am so glad because marketers go we have a big audience but most of it's overseas
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:57.640]  that's good i want ideas i could care less that you know people listening in russia aren't buying
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:03.880]  my products usually some of its ships there it's about breaking the mold changing history fighting
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:08.200]  these tyrants that think everybody's dumb and so they try to dumb people down further to manage
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:12.840]  everybody i have children i don't want them to live in a world like that i wouldn't dumb your
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:18.120]  kids down so i could be over them why would you do that to mine and then they lie about us they
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:25.000]  demonize us they call us racist and evil when they're the racist and and and dr. course he's our
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.720]  guest i want to just have him finish up on a couple subjects he helped with world net daily
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:34.600]  and lewd obs in the drudge report we were part of that but it's not about getting credit it's about
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:40.040]  winning holding back a lot of their north american union integration but now they've got this
[02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:43.960]  Atlantic deal they're trying to merge that the tpp it just keeps coming back but we've got to come
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:49.480]  back again and fight so we've got bernie sanderson get the trucks off the road you know superfast rail
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:54.760]  i'm sure the elites would like that i'll get his comment on that in the economy am i overstating
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:58.600]  how serious it is to have the federal reserves say they're not going to raise interest rates because
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:07.960]  the world economy spiraling and the headline out of seeing in that we have record numbers of us
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:14.440]  treasuries us debt being dumped and they're not buying it at record levels here it is foreign
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:19.240]  governments dump us debt at record rate market analysis so they'll be gone about seven eight
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:24.760]  minutes and i'll go to your calls you've got the floor sir um those two questions getting into
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:31.480]  the global integration into the world tyranny the pope pushing it what all that means and
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:37.240]  the napa super corridor that supposedly doesn't exist according to cnn they fired dobs over even
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:42.680]  though it's public and then how that segues into the global economy well the first of all the
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:50.600]  the mountain of debt the treasury could collapse uh any day i mean you could have the global europe
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:54.520]  is going to negative interest rates which is the new innovation that they think they can get
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:37:03.480]  people to pay them for holding government debt uh that's the way they think they can finance
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:10.280]  increasing deficits without having to pay interest uh it's all a scam it's going to collapse uh it's
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:16.040]  in the process of collapsing i mean part of why you asked did russia pull out uh russia pulled
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:20.920]  out for several reasons of syria there was a they accomplished what they wanted they propped up a saw
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:25.800]  it was a minimax solution they spent the minimum amount of money to get the result they also made
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:31.800]  a deal on the price of oil price of oil is going to now start going over 45 a barrel everybody's
[02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:37.400]  going to restrict supplies so the arabia is going to get the help they wanted in terms of pushing at
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:43.800]  least back isis somewhat uh it's a it's a great deal on the price of oil the price of oil stays
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:50.600]  over 40 a barrel the economy worldwide won't collapse the price of oil is 30 a barrel and
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:56.760]  the natural price of oil right now probably about 15 to 20 a barrel uh what would happen is
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:03.640]  you'd have a global collapse of massive proportions the stock market lose 45 000 points over a couple
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:10.120]  of trading sessions easily could happen or if it didn't happen that precipitously would happen
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:15.960]  more gradually over a couple of months uh the economic situation is a house of cards it's all
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:21.960]  built on massive massive amounts of debt uh no government of the world has any intention to make
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:26.760]  a fulfilling its liabilities and it's all lie they want to keep it propped up as long as they can
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:32.760]  keep it propped up you're right alex i think your show is also important people can position
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:37.400]  themselves to understand what's not going on what's going on not to get swept up about it to be
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:46.120]  winners not losers in what's going to be a global collapse now trump will they uh power structures
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:54.600]  the global elites backed up by the g.o.p leadership in washington the far left of the democratic party
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:39:00.840]  will do everything possible to destroy trump including soros funded renarites which the
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:08.200]  media will cover like lap dogs and blame trump's form the public isn't buying it and i'm going to
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:13.160]  encourage and continue to encourage john trump to come back on your show and they can do a great
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:19.080]  service by and have for years alex i've been on your show now going back more than 10 years
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:25.880]  and have promoted and um supported the work you're doing i think you're doing very important
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:30.520]  work and your message needs to be heard i'm glad 25 million people are listening to you there ought
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:34.920]  to be 50 million well thank you sir and again it's not about us sitting here patting each other on
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:40.680]  the back you know that i know that it's about well there's not a lot of us that know this and and and
[02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:44.680]  i wish everybody else understood it's starting to happen but we don't want people to wake up and
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:49.880]  then get misdirected by bernie sanders or somebody into something just as bad or worse this is an epic
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:55.560]  time to be alive incredible things are happening i literally get chills talking about this because
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:40:01.640]  i've studied history and we are entering such an incredibly dangerous time we have such bad people
[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:06.040]  in charge because you got to be bad to not care about people and then from there you start enjoying
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:11.720]  being mean and they really are nasty horrible people uh and and we've got a chance to stop them
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:17.320]  if we come together and educate others and so that's why i compliment corsie he's complimenting me
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:22.280]  because because we're in a fight folks i mean i know he wants to beat the globalist i know he
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:27.320]  doesn't want his family to be enslaved it's just a normal male instinct if you're a good person
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:31.640]  and we're certainly not perfect but i mean the globalists are so bad folks if you knew how bad
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:36.280]  they were if you're a new listener you wouldn't make jokes about it you wouldn't know hawk conspiracy
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:41.720]  theories and all this stuff this is all public it's dangerous and they were positioning a world
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:45.640]  collapse that they think is going to bring in total control and the way they've engineered it
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:50.120]  there's no way to get out of it now it's designed to give them more control but it's like a black hole
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:55.400]  have they spun this thing too big too wide and too deep and that's what i want to hit in closing
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:41:00.520]  as a top expert on banking and global markets you predicted what's happened we're now entering it
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:06.120]  how serious is this domino effect with them dumping the treasuries it is very serious and it could
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:11.320]  i mean this whole thing the economic system can collapse any day globalists decide they wanted
[02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:17.560]  to collapse it's that simple but you know the point i want to make is that you know once people
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:24.840]  have seen you know the globalists they've seen the evil for as pathetically hideous and ridiculous
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:32.120]  as it is i mean it's it's it's an old joke it's a soros you know in the wheelchair with his oxygen
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:39.400]  wanting to control the world it's a it's a hideous joke and where donald trump is so powerful as he's
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:46.360]  exposing it you know the little rubio and the you know exposing rubio as being a tool of the
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:53.320]  establishment the way he was uh in the what he would do to hillary his great ability is to make
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:58.920]  people see to the ridiculous nature of the globalists how little power they really have and to make
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:05.320]  them you know a parody of themselves to make them hideous to make them a joke because it is a joke
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:10.440]  to think that any small group of elitists could control the world or want to control the world
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:16.760]  world want to know every conversation through the nsa all these other issues have the entire america
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:21.880]  be unemployed because we've shipped the jobs off to china and indonesia and who knows where for a
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:28.680]  few bankers and multinational corporations to benefit once people see it they can't go back
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:36.040]  the lie is apparent and it's the exposing of the lie which is what you know you do every day i'm
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:40.840]  trying to do every day what you know people of good will are trying to do and i think
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:47.000]  trump is going to succeed because he has a gift doesn't care if he's not politically correct
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:52.040]  doesn't care of making kelly objects to him he understands it's all a hoax and just by being
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:57.880]  truly confident uh they've tried to banish true male energy from the world i mean they hate it
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:02.120]  and they tried to banish true femininity because they because it's just too strong they want us
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:07.320]  to worship the state like it's kim jong-un and it is an old joke it is a joke it doesn't deliver
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:12.600]  freedom delivers the only problem is doctor it produces so many goods and so many services
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:18.040]  our kids and grandkids get spoiled myself included compared to my grandfathers how do we stop that
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:25.240]  how do we culturally have freedom and then not turn into slobs well it's one of those moments
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:30.200]  where people have got to start by saying no it's you know the the network movie opened the window
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:35.560]  said no i'm not going to take it anymore people are saying that and you know watch making kelly
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:40.600]  and all the others have an earphone and they're all told what to say you think anybody on fox or
[02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:45.960]  any other network is on that network without being programmed by an ailes or his counterpart
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:51.240]  and every other network it's all a corporate line you know turn on one channel or the other what's
[02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:56.440]  good about the current it's like when you know we were able to with the slip boats john olneal
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:01.560]  turn on for for a while there's slip boat slip boat slip boat finally you've got donald trump on
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:07.000]  every channel donald trump donald trump donald trump and it's breaking through the paradigm
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.360]  you break through the globalist paradigm show it for the lie that it is make it appear to be
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:17.800]  ridiculous and and deserving of scorn and derision and let donald trump continue to call it out
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:25.800]  we gave obama another double prize last hour as a joke sir worldnetdaily.com wnd.com all your
[02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:32.920]  books to be found there it's roomcoursey.com in closing i think they're going to try to have the
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:37.880]  rnc they've said they are and they've had the head of the rnc rules committee go on tv and say oh
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:42.600]  your vote doesn't matter again and then giggling about it the disconnect it's like marina and
[02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:46.440]  tornette didn't really say let them eat cake when they were starving but they said she did well no
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:51.880]  they're actually saying let them eat cake i think and they're hubris i think they're crazy enough
[02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:57.720]  to try to steal it and if that doesn't work uh i think they're going to try to kill trump i mean
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:03.400]  they're trying to mainline on everything from nbc to the new york times saying kill him and then
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:09.160]  nobody's getting in trouble uh i really think i just don't know i don't know i mean maybe they
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:13.960]  want to start a right wing civil war because they know they can't beat us politically uh i'm just
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:19.160]  really concerned i just have a bad feeling well first of all let's hope all the politicians
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:24.200]  apparently they all stay safe as it's this catastrophic they have violence and no one
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:29.640]  should want it for any reason uh the point is though that you've got some voices you've got
[02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:35.000]  newt gingrich pat bucannon and the republican party saying to the establishment you know the
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:41.480]  gig is up mcconnell bainer you know take your cocaine and your marijuana go smoke it on the
[02:45:41.480 --> 02:45:46.440]  golf course if that's what you want to do but get out of washington dc the power structures
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:52.440]  have got to be closed down the k street money gotta start firing the u.s government by department
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:55.320]  they don't care what department and that's why they're scared of trump they know people like
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:46:00.600]  you advise him yeah and say you know pick a pick a department they can't fire them
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:05.160]  then move the state department to normal asca and and let them have their civil service
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:10.440]  lums show up there you know move the postal department down in the middle of umid desert
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:16.120]  you know what does he centralize the governor these people want their jobs the federal government
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:21.480]  fine but you know you're showing up in bedrock tomorrow and there's not going to be an air
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:26.760]  conditioned bus and see how many people stay in the federal government you've got to get this
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:32.840]  government back what the founders had in mind were we the people um with a second amendment
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:38.440]  and a strong first amendment not being required to be politically correct you know rule our
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:43.640]  families at our homes and try to make a living and get through this life respectfully without
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:49.000]  being imprisoned by some globalist who wants to send your job to china while telling you it's
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:54.440]  a good idea and i think trump is calling out that game and making it appear as ridiculous as it's
[02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:59.160]  always been i agree so let me ask you this then what is what will their next step to try to block
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:03.480]  trump b because they they seem to be so arrogant even though they got sophisticated propaganda
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:08.120]  that when the pope and the communist chinese and everybody and versente fox and everyone
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:14.920]  says you can't have trump the america people go wow why is that i mean that's again it just shows
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:21.240]  they don't get that trump's only a manifestation of how hated the system is and that basically
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:27.640]  it's already collapsed it's it's dead and doesn't know it's the walking dead yeah it says correct
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:33.160]  but you know they've tried everything global warming which is a joke open borders which is a joke
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:37.800]  you know you can't say anything about islam which is a joke you know anything about anybody
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:44.600]  you want to say politically correct or incorrect first amendment and you know the the point is
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:49.880]  people are sick of it they're tired of it because they listen to the lies and you get you know kids
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:56.360]  in school colleges might as well close the colleges if they're going to be is intolerant bastions
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:01.400]  of stupid thinking leftism and you know the people are sick of it they're tired of it
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:06.440]  i think it's come to that point the next thing they'll try to do is throw a major global economic
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:13.400]  crisis you can easily throw the world into an economic banking collapse or you'll have a
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:21.320]  9-11 terrorist attack or staged event that will be terrific you know people will be more
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:26.920]  terrorized than they were 9-11 and try to push everybody into non-thinking and you know basically
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:34.120]  we've got to prepare people that these are the last resorts that the the globalists and the leftists
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:40.440]  will and by the way the far right multinational corporations and the left socialists and communists
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:45.080]  are one party just like they work with the muslims the radical muslims because they love anything to
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:51.720]  talitarian like carol quickly as they were in hitler they were one party yes hitler national
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:59.720]  socialism it was of the left you know the democratic party through the through strong
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:07.320]  currents walking out of the 48th convention the dixocrats they were the segregationist the democratic
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:14.360]  party is not the party of racial integration or racial justice the party of total vulcanization
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:18.680]  and the republicans aren't perfect but they they tried the party of lincoln they tried with the
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:23.880]  civil rights act it's the rock of heller republicans it's the bankers the multinational corporations
[02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:30.440]  it's prescott bush raising money for hitler to put you know the german manufacturers together with
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:36.280]  the u.s manufacturers henry ford's ideas of the autobahn and the it's all the same thing dr
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:41.800]  coursey amazing i i i hope you're right another book because i've i've basically read them all
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:48.120]  one last thing because you brought this up i see them if trump gets in office the way to
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:52.920]  counter him is they would implement an economic crisis and claim something he did triggered it
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:57.080]  just like they blame the the the the tariffs that came in once the great depression started
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:02.520]  but i know he's sophisticated enough but i sure hope that he does talk to more people like you
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:06.840]  i know he's talked to you over the years because they're going to pull anything they can to try
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:12.520]  to kill nationalism and discredit it and whether folks like trump or not he now carries the mantle
[02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:18.920]  of masculinity of nationalism of americana is that not accurate yes and donald trump's already there
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:23.720]  he doesn't need my advice or anybody else's advice he's already there that's what makes
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:29.080]  him so good he was there to start with he's still there so behind the scenes he knows about the
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:33.960]  new world order as i'm told he does he's got it down donald trump understands this he understands
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:38.360]  it from the inside he's had to deal with the bankers his entire life donald trump is still
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:43.720]  somebody would own build apartment buildings and he goes stop with the tenants and say how are you
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:50.440]  doing everybody okay here hires the best union labor's pays top dollar donald trump's a good man

[03:03:56.040 --> 03:04:01.000]  really important point humanity losing their instincts another caller grant let's talk about
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:05.640]  the election steve wants to talk about personal freedom and uh john so i'm sure he wants to take
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:11.640]  your calls uh congressman paul ryan being drafted did you have go against uh trump another caller
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:18.920]  wants to raise that john again they're being forced to uncloak though and go you know what
[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:24.440]  we'll just not let you have who you want we have that power but it's illegitimate power and by the
[03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:29.800]  fact that we're going to make them exercise it that will be their undoing that's why resist
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:36.040]  his victory you've got to resist them to make them act like the dirty dogs they are you got to draw
[03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:42.840]  the enemy out it's a gambit and some of us have to be pawns not because we are pawns in our heart
[03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:47.960]  but because a pawn is needed to go out and draw the enemy out and pawn sacrifice and if we get
[03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:53.720]  sacrificed if i get sacrificed it doesn't matter because it's so the children can go on into the
[03:04:53.720 --> 03:05:00.760]  future david night's coming up for your calls and more stay with us we can create a state of the art
[03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:07.480]  rail system which takes blocks off the road last week live trucking dot com posted this clip of
[03:05:07.480 --> 03:05:13.000]  bernie sanders bragging about new innovations in rail technology that will take big rigs off the
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:17.800]  road the article from early march poses the question will the trucking industry be significantly
[03:05:17.800 --> 03:05:23.000]  downsized under a sanders presidency most sanders critics focus on his socialist domestic economic
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:27.640]  plan and bernie makes no secret that he intends to raise taxes on everyone yet on top of bernie's
[03:05:27.640 --> 03:05:31.960]  socialist programs there are the draconian environmental policies he has proposed carbon
[03:05:31.960 --> 03:05:36.840]  taxes and carbon offsets are a centerpiece of the earth worship religion in addition societies
[03:05:36.840 --> 03:05:41.880]  must build vast collectivist infrastructures for instance bernie sanders discusses a new type of
[03:05:41.880 --> 03:05:45.960]  rail system that will take trucks off the road and the truck drivers along with them the statement
[03:05:45.960 --> 03:05:50.760]  made by sanders and others like him is just a small glimpse into what this new slave utopia will
[03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:56.040]  look like rob drew reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news good luck good
[03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:05.960]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war
[03:06:05.960 --> 03:06:12.360]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago
[03:06:12.360 --> 03:06:18.760]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid
[03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:25.720]  sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food
[03:06:25.720 --> 03:06:32.040]  and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate
[03:06:32.040 --> 03:06:39.240]  our journey towards death i personally counter this onslaught with antroplex antroplex is designed
[03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:47.240]  with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[03:06:47.240 --> 03:06:52.280]  inside the human body discover why antroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to

[03:08:10.360 --> 03:08:18.120]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live on the front lines of the info war
[03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:29.240]  or welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night for this final hour on this friday march
[03:08:30.120 --> 03:08:34.680]  18th 2016 one of the stories that's up on the drudge report of course alex has been talking
[03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:40.280]  about this with gerome coursey how the rnc is plotting to rig the convention i thought it was
[03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:44.600]  pretty amazing this particular article they talk about how the rnc rules committee is going to
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:48.680]  decide the party regulations and write the first draft of the convention rules and the rules they
[03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:52.680]  say are crucial because they can determine what's going to happen they say they could set up rules
[03:08:52.680 --> 03:08:57.240]  that would only allow donald trump to run in cleveland or they could set up rules that bring in
[03:08:57.240 --> 03:09:02.360]  people who haven't bothered to participate in the primaries you know when i look at these primaries
[03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:07.080]  and the fact that we spend tens of millions of dollars throughout this country to run elections
[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:12.760]  and these arrogant sobs of the rnc say we're just going to throw this out and that's quite
[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:16.920]  frankly what they're talking about folks when you look at this article the people who come on there's
[03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:22.280]  people who talk off the record and they say well you know this would be suicide it'd be a civil war
[03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:27.160]  it'd be a meltdown we don't want to do that okay for the good of the party let's bring back mc romney
[03:09:27.160 --> 03:09:32.280]  no that's that's zero chance of that happening those people who are saying that are saying that
[03:09:32.280 --> 03:09:39.160]  off the record they don't want their names used okay the people who go on the record people like
[03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:43.720]  rnc chair friebus who we played this multiple times and of course that was something that was
[03:09:43.720 --> 03:09:49.240]  pretty amazing when it first came out about uh i guess it's about a month ago we first played that
[03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:53.320]  and he's he was on cnn he goes no no no no you don't understand it's not election no no they're
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:59.480]  trying to join us and the cnn uh person who's interviewing him allison comrade says well no
[03:09:59.480 --> 03:10:03.960]  well kind of sort but you know there's an election going on no no no no you're not listening to me
[03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:08.040]  they're auditioning to join us now they're all coming out and saying that okay we've got these
[03:10:08.040 --> 03:10:12.760]  people who are delegates and people who are in official positions the people who want to go on
[03:10:12.760 --> 03:10:17.720]  the record the leadership of the rnc are the ones who are saying this you've got some people that
[03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:22.520]  are quietly pushing back and say yeah that's not going to happen uh talk radios got it wrong
[03:10:22.520 --> 03:10:27.720]  so forth and so on right like this for example i say well indeed most of the 19 rule committee
[03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:32.520]  members reached by msnbc opposed any rule enabling new candidates around the convention only three
[03:10:32.520 --> 03:10:37.080]  of them back to rule allowing the new candidates to run well i have to say okay most what does that
[03:10:37.080 --> 03:10:43.640]  mean is that most of the 19 is that nine of them i don't know uh if it was nine of them and three of
[03:10:43.640 --> 03:10:48.840]  them uh would like to let anybody like romney come in who hasn't bothered to participate who
[03:10:48.840 --> 03:10:54.200]  hasn't bothered to take this to the public uh if that's the case that's like 30 we don't know see
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:11:01.000]  that's the whole point they craft this narrative and tell us that uh you know you don't have to uh
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:06.600]  you don't have to worry about this while the people who are the leaders the people who go on record
[03:11:06.600 --> 03:11:12.200]  and give their names are saying yeah we're going to do whatever we want okay here's another guy here
[03:11:12.200 --> 03:11:15.960]  says the fact that the previous as chair has not come out and denounced these high-level
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:20.440]  republican operatives who are blatantly trying to sabotage trump's campaign speaks volumes
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:26.600]  exactly that was diana orrick who backs trump she is a uh somebody who is on the rules committee
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:30.360]  but listen to what the rest of these guys say and again we played this guy alex talked about this
[03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:36.040]  a lot yesterday we played on wednesday this guy uh curly haiglin uh he's like somebody from the
[03:11:36.040 --> 03:11:40.920]  three studious you know like whoop whoop whoop he's uh he said do the primaries choose a nominee
[03:11:40.920 --> 03:11:46.840]  or the convention delegates he says it can't be both so he's doubling down on this he's in your face
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:52.520]  and he tells that crew there at cnnbc they can't believe their ears they say they say well if what
[03:11:52.520 --> 03:11:58.520]  you're saying is true then why have primaries or caucuses he says exactly exactly you're starting
[03:11:58.520 --> 03:12:04.600]  to understand now they're trying to join us we control this and let me tell you something
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:09.480]  as somebody who has worked a long time outside of these two political parties because i didn't
[03:12:09.480 --> 03:12:13.720]  want to be a part of them because they're corruption because the way they have made
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:19.640]  they have monopolized this situation i've seen how they rigged the rules at every level in every
[03:12:19.640 --> 03:12:24.200]  way if you want to run as an independent or you want to run as a third party you can basically
[03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:27.880]  forget it because these same people now who are talking about how they're going to take over the
[03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:32.680]  rnc and set up the rules to make sure that donald trump get in can't get in are the same people
[03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:39.080]  who set up the rules so third parties can't exist so that independent uh candidates cannot exist
[03:12:39.720 --> 03:12:43.800]  if you go through their onerous ballot access rules and as part of the libertarian party
[03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:48.920]  they got very good at doing this but it is a task fit for sisyphus every time you roll the
[03:12:48.920 --> 03:12:54.280]  rock up they roll it back down the next time they say well we got certain rules and you know you each
[03:12:54.280 --> 03:12:57.880]  time you have to create a new political party you got to go out there and collect signatures and so
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:13:02.280]  forth and so on and so that's something they have never done you realize that they never do that
[03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:06.840]  we had situations where the republicans did not meet the ballot requirements and then they came
[03:13:06.840 --> 03:13:10.520]  to a judge and said you know this just really wouldn't be in the interest of the voters if we
[03:13:10.520 --> 03:13:14.600]  didn't have a republican candidate on there so then they make it a three-way race again we had a
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:19.320]  situation where the libertarian filed all the paperwork the democrat filed all the paperwork
[03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:23.800]  the republican party's like oh well we didn't know any libertarians are going to run we can't
[03:13:23.800 --> 03:13:28.120]  let them run against the democrats so uh just put us on the ballot after the fact after we didn't
[03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:33.800]  get the rules in and that's what john casick is trying to do in pennsylvania understand that he is
[03:13:33.800 --> 03:13:37.560]  telling in this narrative that he's telling everybody how he's going to block trump and
[03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:42.280]  get a few delegates so he can have a little bit of weight to throw around at a brokered convention
[03:13:42.280 --> 03:13:49.800]  and possibly get into the uh to be nominated the key part of that is pennsylvania and john casick
[03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:55.880]  didn't file his paperwork on time now what did he do after he missed that paperwork somebody
[03:13:55.880 --> 03:13:59.960]  pointed it out they said hey he doesn't have enough signatures to get on the ballot he only
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:04.520]  needed like 2000 signatures some very low threshold for these republicans and democrats
[03:14:04.520 --> 03:14:10.680]  not like it is for third parties but he couldn't even be bothered to organize and get the signatures
[03:14:10.680 --> 03:14:16.520]  on there for the state that is in his critical path to get the nomination to the presidency
[03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:23.160]  is this guy asleep or what give him something to wake him up okay absolutely incompetent but
[03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:29.320]  because of his sense of entitlement because he is so well connected to the GOP establishment
[03:14:29.320 --> 03:14:33.160]  you know he was pretty high up when he was a congressman he's a governor there in the state
[03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:38.520]  where john bainer was from and of course uh they're feeling a lot of hubris after they stuffed the
[03:14:38.520 --> 03:14:45.560]  ballots probably this last election that we had and i'm telling you uh i don't have any proof of
[03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:50.280]  that okay i'm just telling you my gut feeling and that's why i've never paid that much attention
[03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:55.400]  to elections before because unless you've got a massive movement like the one that we've seen
[03:14:55.400 --> 03:15:01.880]  coming around donald trump unless you come to the table with a 20 lead they're gonna steal it from you
[03:15:02.920 --> 03:15:07.560]  if you've got that kind of a lead they'll kind of just back off like we saw them do in florida
[03:15:07.560 --> 03:15:13.400]  they threw everything they had at trump including massive amounts of negative advertising it wasn't
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:18.200]  sticking nothing was working so that the last minute they all pull out redirect their advertising
[03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:21.640]  somewhere else okay run like a bunch of rats because they'll fight you somewhere else they're
[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:26.600]  smart enough to do that they won't dig in and and die on that hill they'll go run somewhere else so
[03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:33.960]  we look at the situation and now we have in pennsylvania john casick who says well okay uh we
[03:15:33.960 --> 03:15:38.280]  you know we had like 2000 and you know we're a couple hundred short on that and somebody
[03:15:38.280 --> 03:15:43.640]  points it out and they say huh well you know we want that overturned because the guy pointed it out
[03:15:43.640 --> 03:15:49.640]  out past the deadline and it's like no the deadline is for you to get your signatures in and he said
[03:15:49.640 --> 03:15:55.560]  he was there before uh the deadline of five o'clock they stamped it at five five thirteen
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:16:00.920]  he says i was online i mean it's like the dmv okay uh he stamped it at five thirteen they said oh
[03:16:00.920 --> 03:16:05.400]  he's too late he was 13 minutes late and was like hey dude you were over you're a couple hundred
[03:16:05.400 --> 03:16:10.920]  votes shy of getting on the ballot in pennsylvania john casick shouldn't be on the ballot and quite
[03:16:10.920 --> 03:16:16.040]  frankly ted cruz is not even eligible to run for president okay that's how they've been the rules here
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:21.640]  but let's talk about this going back to curly again or the three stuges he says the primaries
[03:16:21.640 --> 03:16:26.200]  choose the nominee or do the convention delegates you can't have it both ways he says well democracy
[03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:33.400]  is pretty popular but it's simply not the way we do it yeah you know what we have a democratic
[03:16:33.400 --> 03:16:40.200]  republic we elect representatives but we do it democratically okay we're not going into a
[03:16:40.200 --> 03:16:45.720]  full on oligarchy of course we have that already we've had it for a long time and that's the beauty
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:53.080]  of this campaign is that it is showing what these people are about and it's showing it to a larger
[03:16:53.080 --> 03:16:57.800]  group of people that saw it four years ago with ron paul campaign anybody that was following ron paul
[03:16:57.800 --> 03:17:05.640]  last time saw the corruption the theft the in-your-face manipulation of rules that mit romney did
[03:17:05.640 --> 03:17:10.120]  where they said no you know we don't even want ron paul to speak so we're going to write some
[03:17:10.120 --> 03:17:14.920]  new rules but then they have this to say they say when you're challenging them on that they say
[03:17:14.920 --> 03:17:19.240]  they stand on the rules they say the rules are plain you have to get a majority of the delegates
[03:17:19.240 --> 03:17:25.080]  we've got a process in place we have delegates who vote say that's like saying wait a minute wait a
[03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:29.480]  minute we have a constitution here that we have to obey and then they ignore it after they take
[03:17:29.480 --> 03:17:33.800]  an oath to it these are the same people and remember this is where we began this article
[03:17:33.800 --> 03:17:39.000]  the rnc rules committee decides that party the party regulations that will write the draft of
[03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:42.280]  the convention rules and the rules are critical and those are going to be one of the first things
[03:17:42.280 --> 03:17:47.240]  they do and then they come back and say well wait a minute we have these rules that we're bound to
[03:17:48.040 --> 03:17:54.040]  you write the rules you change the rules you do it at will okay just like you change presumably the
[03:17:54.040 --> 03:17:59.320]  constitution at will which you're not doing because nobody reads the rules of the constitution either
[03:17:59.880 --> 03:18:03.480]  nobody holds their feet to the fire so they just they say well we've got a constitution we
[03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:07.640]  have to obey they appeal to that for their authority just like they appeal to these rules that we're
[03:18:07.640 --> 03:18:11.800]  bound by these rules we have to do whatever they say then they proceed to change the rules as they
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:16.360]  wish just as they say well you know we're going to change the constitution then don't do it the way
[03:18:16.360 --> 03:18:20.680]  the constitution says the constitution has to be changed they'll do it by their laws they'll do it by
[03:18:20.680 --> 03:18:24.840]  an executive order or they'll do it by supreme court decision or whatever our bureaucratic
[03:18:24.840 --> 03:18:29.880]  regulation you pick it okay they've got a lot of different ways that they ignore the constitution
[03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:35.320]  finally we got this guy here Sean Spicer rnc communications director says the rnc's position
[03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:38.840]  is the delegates and the members of the rules committee will decide what the rules of the
[03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:45.080]  convention will be there you go say we decide and we will decide who comes in meanwhile they've got
[03:18:45.080 --> 03:18:50.120]  paul ryan who remember he was the guy who was not going to be speaker in the house he says i'm not
[03:18:50.120 --> 03:18:55.480]  interested in being speaker then he becomes speaker now he says i'm not interested in being
[03:18:55.480 --> 03:19:00.200]  coronated by the GOP elite at a convention so then what does he do well yesterday he goes
[03:19:00.200 --> 03:19:04.760]  to palm beach florida he meets thursday night last night at a pricey french restaurant here
[03:19:04.760 --> 03:19:08.760]  with some of the party's biggest donors i'll play a clip of what that might have looked like here
[03:19:09.720 --> 03:19:14.280]  biggest donors to assess a political landscape dominated by one vexing question what do we do
[03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:20.200]  to stop donald trump say the dinner was a highlight of a secretive two-day conclave see we're not
[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:24.760]  stakeholders we're not allowed to know what's going on if they were still allowed to legally
[03:19:24.760 --> 03:19:29.080]  smoke cigarettes in these uh restaurants it would be a smoke filled room but you know
[03:19:29.080 --> 03:19:33.800]  things have changed we're so much more enlightened now and of course one of the guys leading this
[03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:38.840]  was new york hedge fund manager paul singer paul singer the guy who announced that he was a
[03:19:38.840 --> 03:19:45.000]  cruise backer a couple of months ago remember just like the major super PAC that is coming
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:50.520]  after donald trump is funded by a bunch of romney people a bunch of people who have made public
[03:19:50.520 --> 03:19:55.720]  their professions to support abortion gay marriage all these things the conservatives think they're
[03:19:55.720 --> 03:19:59.640]  supporting and yet they call it our principles PAC stay with us we'll be right back there are you

[03:20:24.120 --> 03:20:29.400]  deal and when we said no originally and they brought the price down and then when we still said no
[03:20:29.400 --> 03:20:33.080]  they brought in the manager and they brought the price down even lower and they started breaking
[03:20:33.080 --> 03:20:36.920]  out in different ways to make it look like it was this really awesome deal the reality was it wasn't

[03:26:09.400 --> 03:26:14.680]  known political operatives as well as political analysts here's a scene in a restaurant where
[03:26:14.680 --> 03:26:23.640]  these guys are discussing donald trump you see the wine being poured i know we've been in every
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:29.880]  presidential campaign probably since 1980 and various degrees and in trump's problem he doesn't
[03:26:29.880 --> 03:26:35.400]  have a company you don't know what his compass is yeah that's a major g.o.p fundraiser speaking
[03:26:35.400 --> 03:26:39.640]  all the time as i'm sure of it around the table doesn't they say why don't you republicans do
[03:26:39.640 --> 03:26:45.160]  something about this guy okay hold that right there this is venweber now when they put this up
[03:26:45.160 --> 03:26:49.560]  they say venweber former congressman let me tell you he's got a little bit more to his biography
[03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:55.320]  than that okay he's also member of the project for new american century okay cosign the letter
[03:26:55.320 --> 03:26:59.640]  to president bill clinton in 1998 with chainie and rumsfeld he advocated for the removal of
[03:26:59.640 --> 03:27:04.920]  saddam hussein he's part of the bush administration that then did that and brought us into a war for
[03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:09.400]  which they they based on a lie of weapons of mass destruction he was managing partner for a lobbying
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:16.840]  firm he was paid $360,000 to lobby for freddy mac so they could keep congress from enacting
[03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:22.840]  regulations that would have stopped or halted the subprime mortgage fraud okay for his part
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:28.520]  and keeping that fraud going then weber got $360,000 he's on the board of the council of four

[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:40.120]  NGOs that they use to permit revolution everywhere okay so then he let's let's continue with what he
[03:27:40.120 --> 03:27:47.320]  has to say here i'm sorry this is not the soviet union we can't call a meeting and decide trump
[03:27:47.320 --> 03:27:54.600]  is out and we hate that stop it right there okay hear that oh i'm sorry this isn't the soviet union
[03:27:54.600 --> 03:27:59.880]  we just can't do it like that and they all say isn't that a shame the reality is folks
[03:27:59.880 --> 03:28:05.400]  we are living under a system that you don't realize truly is being run by a few oligarchs
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:09.720]  just like the soviet union is let's continue on with some more of these shills here well they're
[03:28:09.720 --> 03:28:14.280]  not shills actually these are the guys who are the elites we talk about republicans are hierarchical
[03:28:14.280 --> 03:28:20.920]  respectful of authority we fall in line and trump has interrupted that cycle stop that right there
[03:28:20.920 --> 03:28:26.840]  stop that right there okay back that up just a little bit he says republicans respect authority
[03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:32.520]  we're hierarchical we fall in line these guys don't these guys don't they're talking about
[03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:38.520]  how they're not going to fall in line okay they're saying wait a minute our GOP voters
[03:28:38.520 --> 03:28:44.360]  were hierarchical our GOP voters fell in line our GOP voters did what we told them to do and
[03:28:44.360 --> 03:28:50.120]  trump is getting them off the reservation okay he's starting a slave revolt we can't have that
[03:28:50.120 --> 03:28:54.360]  and then listen to what he has to say back that up just a little bit and let's play that respectful
[03:28:54.360 --> 03:29:00.600]  of authority we fall in line and trump has interrupted that cycle he's not articulate
[03:29:00.600 --> 03:29:07.240]  he's not poised he's not informed all he has going for him is a lot of votes stop it right there
[03:29:07.240 --> 03:29:14.920]  stop it right there all he's got going for him is a lot of votes well can't have that can't have
[03:29:14.920 --> 03:29:19.000]  that and he doesn't care anything about how articulate donald trump is let me tell you
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:25.320]  something donald trump knows how to reach a lot of people even though he's talking at a low level
[03:29:25.320 --> 03:29:30.200]  he's doing it so he can reach a lot of people and that guy who was talking there ed rogers cfr
[03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:35.640]  life member center for a new american century a neocon perpetual war think tank that brings
[03:29:35.640 --> 03:29:41.240]  together war mongers of both parties okay he had hillary clinton kicking off the foundation
[03:29:41.240 --> 03:29:45.800]  of his center for a new american security and these guys go on in this meeting to talk about
[03:29:45.800 --> 03:29:50.120]  how they would prefer to have hillary clinton that's what they say stay with us the empires on

[03:30:22.760 --> 03:30:29.400]  catch the attention of local cops late last night wilmington pd announced they'd caught schusler
[03:30:29.400 --> 03:30:35.000]  and were charging him with driving recklessly and damaging a campaign sign the man will also

[03:33:21.320 --> 03:33:25.400]  welcome back to the alex joneshaw i'm david night and joining me in the studio is rob do he had a
[03:33:25.400 --> 03:33:30.680]  very interesting encounter yesterday at south by southwest he talked to the resident scientist
[03:33:30.680 --> 03:33:36.680]  for the young turks uh jade level is that her name that's her name okay i wasn't aware rob
[03:33:36.680 --> 03:33:42.200]  that the young turks were turning into a scientific think tank they know everything
[03:33:42.200 --> 03:33:47.640]  because they're liberal and they're smarter than us and because you know having a post says so
[03:33:47.640 --> 03:33:52.120]  you know yeah that's the basic attitude they you know i asked her credentials because you know
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:55.800]  normally i don't i mean you know i don't ask people's credentials right the thing is is that
[03:33:55.800 --> 03:34:00.040]  these people who like to pontificate about climate change and all this other kind of stuff yeah
[03:34:00.040 --> 03:34:05.480]  science all these people they love to they love to parade their credentials around and say hey i
[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:11.000]  teach at such and such a university or i have a phd and you know what they don't have phds and
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:16.840]  climate okay because it wasn't even offered as a field of study is so brand new and and so uh
[03:34:16.840 --> 03:34:20.920]  i would say and it's infancy but infancy but i would say it's really more infantile now her
[03:34:20.920 --> 03:34:27.400]  thing right here is that she has a master's degree in science literacy and i'm looking at this and
[03:34:27.400 --> 03:34:30.920]  it's like when i was an engineer and used to laugh about that and say yeah that's kind of like uh
[03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:35.400]  physics for arts and lovers you know they would have they'll have one kind of physics track you know
[03:34:35.400 --> 03:34:40.520]  which didn't have any calculus in it or mathematical analysis and and that would be the track that they
[03:34:40.520 --> 03:34:46.040]  go down so now she's gone into uh into uh but she does have a bs in neuroscience uh you know my
[03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:50.840]  hats off to her at least she committed to meeting and having a debate yeah she had just given a
[03:34:50.840 --> 03:34:57.240]  speech called cy wars which is talking about how to talk to people like us who who read for ourselves
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:35:01.960]  and think for ourselves and and can research and how to debunk the things that we say but
[03:35:01.960 --> 03:35:05.960]  being very polite and nice about it and she was very polite is that branch of neuroscience she's
[03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:11.000]  got in her uh background is that really kind of more psyops i guess it could be yeah it could be
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:16.280]  yeah so there's her thing cy wars the dark side of tactics for science so that's her whole thing so
[03:35:16.280 --> 03:35:20.360]  i was glad that she was able to spur the moment to i tweeted her during her speech while her
[03:35:20.360 --> 03:35:24.840]  speech was going on she got back with me within 10 minutes like her producer did and said sure
[03:35:24.840 --> 03:35:30.520]  we'll meet you girl let's do it and you know that i was very surprised with so my hats off to her for
[03:35:30.520 --> 03:35:36.040]  for you know sure committing to the debate i have three clips i put out the video this morning
[03:35:36.040 --> 03:35:40.840]  uh young turks scientist debunked and uh so that's out and it's getting some pretty good views at
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:44.440]  this point and it's it's long it's about 15 minutes long and i wanted to put the whole thing up i cut
[03:35:44.440 --> 03:35:49.320]  out just a few things in the debate we actually got thrown out uh for talking in front of the south
[03:35:49.320 --> 03:35:53.400]  by southwest interactive sign because that's a no no no it's actually interacting from the interactive
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:35:58.840]  sign and that's supposed to film at a film festival i make that point too so um so the first clip uh
[03:35:58.840 --> 03:36:02.280]  let's let's do this one it's on climate change she starts talking about climate change i'm like
[03:36:02.280 --> 03:36:06.360]  okay you picked the first subject climate change let's go and so i asked her a couple questions
[03:36:06.360 --> 03:36:09.800]  and then you know she proceeds to tell me that you know it's all humans fault and it doesn't
[03:36:09.800 --> 03:36:14.360]  matter how much money it costs we just need to you know buck up and and pay it and they're saying
[03:36:14.360 --> 03:36:18.440]  it could be a hundred trillion dollars to to fix the problem i don't know because the purpose
[03:36:18.440 --> 03:36:22.840]  of this whole thing is to establish a well they want to create a reason to have a world
[03:36:22.840 --> 03:36:26.600]  government ran away to fund the world there you let's understand what's going on with this
[03:36:26.600 --> 03:36:31.320]  i was out yesterday as you know and and uh as i was driving around my wife and i were looking at
[03:36:31.320 --> 03:36:35.400]  the thermometer in the car as well as a thermometer on the bank and they're two degrees apart i said
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:41.240]  look at that that's more than it takes to melt the entire world okay and we've had the the the guy
[03:36:41.240 --> 03:36:46.200]  who founded the weather channel and did that for decades said look you know this generation doesn't
[03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:50.120]  understand the days and we used to have mercury thermometers you know you'd read the thing you'd
[03:36:50.120 --> 03:36:55.880]  have to be very careful you didn't get a parallax error but everybody understands that there is a
[03:36:55.880 --> 03:37:00.360]  if you really look at this a scientist understands that there are limits just like we look at polling
[03:37:00.360 --> 03:37:04.520]  okay they say well that's plus or minus four percent okay and if they have a scientific poll
[03:37:04.520 --> 03:37:09.960]  or whatever and those polls aren't too scientific either but anyway the when you look at the when
[03:37:09.960 --> 03:37:13.880]  you measure temperature temperature it depends on where you put the thermometer even in the same
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:17.800]  area you got it in the sonder you got it in the shade you're going to get a radical difference
[03:37:17.800 --> 03:37:21.000]  and you're going to get more than one or two degrees and yet they're telling us that the
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:26.680]  entire world is going to melt if we get a one degree raise and they don't even have a legitimate
[03:37:26.680 --> 03:37:31.320]  base to compare this to they don't they never had surface temps of greenland our article to compare
[03:37:31.320 --> 03:37:34.520]  to with you know for the whole world if you're going to compare everything you got to have
[03:37:34.520 --> 03:37:38.920]  temp thermometers everywhere and then they've come out where they're they're cherry picking
[03:37:38.920 --> 03:37:43.720]  these results and picking hot thermometers around the world like oh the thermometer at the airport
[03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:47.880]  the thermometer that sits in the sun like you said yeah one of the first things that they made us
[03:37:47.880 --> 03:37:52.200]  understand in engineering was okay look you guys you're doing all this stuff you're working with
[03:37:52.200 --> 03:37:57.160]  models you're calculating this all out very precisely but understand that there's a limit
[03:37:57.160 --> 03:38:01.400]  to the accuracy of what you can measure there's only so many variables yeah exactly so understand
[03:38:01.400 --> 03:38:06.520]  that even though you get this down to uh six decimal places first of all throw that away
[03:38:06.520 --> 03:38:09.800]  you need to go back to three that that was one of the key things I said you know back in the days
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:13.240]  when we used to have slide rules my professor said you know we could only get three digits of
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:18.200]  accuracy and that was much better you guys think that you can get stuff down to 15 digits of accuracy
[03:38:18.200 --> 03:38:22.280]  that's not there and you got to understand what the tolerance is with what you're measuring these
[03:38:22.280 --> 03:38:25.640]  people don't even they don't have a base and they don't understand what the tolerance is but
[03:38:25.640 --> 03:38:29.400]  David you really don't know anything because you're not a young turk scientist so let's let the
[03:38:29.400 --> 03:38:34.440]  experts okay this is the one on climate change let's start with climate change so if you pick
[03:38:34.440 --> 03:38:38.920]  the first topic yeah here we go so the greenland ice cores show that the temperature of the planet
[03:38:38.920 --> 03:38:44.760]  used to be a lot warmer and a lot colder long before uh suv's existed long before cold power plants
[03:38:44.760 --> 03:38:50.760]  existed absolutely so you could say maybe humans are causing a insignificant amount of climate
[03:38:50.760 --> 03:38:55.720]  change but the money it'll take to reverse whatever they're doing is going to cost way more than what
[03:38:55.720 --> 03:39:00.200]  it would do if we just work on processes to get out of that what do you say to that great there's
[03:39:00.200 --> 03:39:05.000]  two points there one is are humans actually causing climate change are we causing the climate to
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:10.120]  change more than it would have and overwhelmingly the science is in that yes the climate is changing
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:15.720]  much faster than it ever has before even when it was colder and even when it was hotter so you're
[03:39:15.720 --> 03:39:19.720]  talking about how though it was colder and it was hotter and that's true but those changes happened
[03:39:19.720 --> 03:39:25.640]  over tens of thousands of years before humans were where we are now at the top of the food chain so
[03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:30.440]  yes the climate did change in the past it would have been catastrophic if humans had been alive
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:34.200]  and the climate change we're seeing now it was happening on a much faster scale hundreds or
[03:39:34.200 --> 03:39:39.400]  thousands of times faster so absolutely humans are causing climate change what should we do about
[03:39:39.400 --> 03:39:46.520]  it is a great question the the economic argument is an interesting one do we want to keep the climate
[03:39:46.520 --> 03:39:51.320]  the way it is or can we afford to let climate change happen and just keep our economic policies
[03:39:51.320 --> 03:39:57.960]  the way they are my opinion is that the amount of money it's going to cost us when the coast of
[03:39:57.960 --> 03:40:04.040]  North America starts to flood it's going to be a lot more money to fix that than to stop and fix
[03:40:04.040 --> 03:40:09.800]  something here it's like a stitch in time saves nine if we do invest now some people will have to
[03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:15.560]  pay an economic burden but how much it's going to save us is like tens or hundreds of times more
[03:40:15.560 --> 03:40:20.680]  that's my opinion it's the future so who knows the future that's what you expect from somebody
[03:40:20.680 --> 03:40:24.680]  that didn't have to do math for their degree it's like just wave your hands and it's there look
[03:40:24.680 --> 03:40:29.160]  so the language that she uses again there's oh climate change is changing whatever and
[03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:33.000]  she doesn't go back to global warming okay and we had global warming there was a question
[03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:38.760]  before that before they wanted to say are humans responsible for that and the question was
[03:40:38.760 --> 03:40:43.400]  is their global warming okay so now by saying climate change they can ignore the fact that it's
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:47.560]  not warming okay and they can say well the climate is changing because it's always changing and
[03:40:47.560 --> 03:40:51.880]  humans are responsible we gotta create a world government to pay for it kill humans yeah then
[03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:57.480]  we go into the life cycle of uh of you know what trees do and she said there's no way there's no
[03:40:57.480 --> 03:41:01.640]  studies out there that say you know when there's more carbon dioxide trees take more of it in and
[03:41:01.640 --> 03:41:06.600]  grow faster which there are studies I even put them in there if you if anybody watches the video
[03:41:06.600 --> 03:41:10.600]  they scroll down to the description I put almost every article I actually ran out of room in the
[03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:15.320]  YouTube description to put every article that is in that video so you know I back it up tried to
[03:41:15.320 --> 03:41:20.280]  with sources did she say that there was nothing that showed that that plants need carbon dioxide
[03:41:20.280 --> 03:41:25.160]  she said they won't they won't if there's more oxygen there I don't breathe faster I'm like uh
[03:41:26.280 --> 03:41:31.320]  okay yeah right I just let her talk really and that's how you got to win these debates you know
[03:41:31.320 --> 03:41:35.560]  yelling at people doesn't really do any good and she's you know nice person I'm not going to yell
[03:41:35.560 --> 03:41:40.120]  at her you know I will say she was willing to talk about it yeah which is more than the people
[03:41:40.120 --> 03:41:46.680]  that Rob Jacobson and I ran into at the weather conference it was the meteorological society had
[03:41:46.680 --> 03:41:50.520]  their thing there and they had this group there from George Soros and that they would not say
[03:41:50.520 --> 03:41:55.000]  anything on the record you know if your ideas are so bulletproof don't be afraid to express them
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:41:59.240]  and talk about them with others that's right and when you are because I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
[03:41:59.240 --> 03:42:03.480]  at all step up with anybody it doesn't bother me now the next slide I have two more clips the next
[03:42:03.480 --> 03:42:09.800]  one is really funny um we we go into GMOs and we start talking about the gene gun okay which is
[03:42:09.800 --> 03:42:14.520]  how they used to and they still do this in some ways it's it's changed but when the technology
[03:42:14.520 --> 03:42:22.920]  started the guy took a 22 caliber pistol or used a 22 caliber blank to project genes from something
[03:42:22.920 --> 03:42:28.680]  else into vegetables and they see how they would absorb but it was literally like boom like shooting
[03:42:28.680 --> 03:42:33.240]  with a shotgun pretty crude and and she said absolutely nothing like that exists and then I
[03:42:33.240 --> 03:42:41.640]  have to show her the evidence literally so let's roll that clip okay thank you so much I really
[03:42:41.640 --> 03:42:45.160]  appreciate it oh that's us getting I'll just do a tag out here and we'll finish it up that's us
[03:42:45.160 --> 03:42:48.600]  getting kicked out first all right we've been asked to leave so we're gonna go downstairs and finish
[03:42:48.600 --> 03:42:57.320]  up this interview what so we've been asked to leave the really nice people from south by southwest
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:03.480]  or like we know this is film and interactive but don't film here don't film where there's film
[03:43:03.480 --> 03:43:08.200]  it's a film festival so we don't want any filming going on you're familiar with GMOs right yes all
[03:43:08.200 --> 03:43:15.800]  right and I read a book about I think it was by Jeffrey Smith and describing how they make GMOs
[03:43:15.800 --> 03:43:20.520]  he talks about the golden gene gun where they actually with a 22 caliber gun they shoot genes
[03:43:20.520 --> 03:43:24.920]  into whatever they want to turn it into and then they just see what happens does that sound like
[03:43:24.920 --> 03:43:31.560]  science to you in no way does anyone use a 22 caliber gun to inject the golden gene gun the
[03:43:31.560 --> 03:43:38.280]  golden gene gun in no way is that accurate major alternative to the use of agro bacterium to get
[03:43:38.280 --> 03:43:45.960]  genes into living plant cells is a physical method called the gene gun which literally shoots
[03:43:46.680 --> 03:43:54.680]  gold or tungsten particles into living plant cells carrying DNA on my surface
[03:43:54.680 --> 03:44:02.200]  okay boys and girls there's a cliff but there's still no action I had to get two sources David
[03:44:02.200 --> 03:44:09.880]  I had to have two sources but I give three actually physically fired into a cell allowing it to be
[03:44:09.880 --> 03:44:18.360]  transformed the first embodiment of this by the fellow at Cornell John Sanford who invented it
[03:44:18.360 --> 03:44:28.520]  actually used a 22 caliber blank to accelerate a plastic bullet with a drop of tungsten and DNA
[03:44:28.520 --> 03:44:36.520]  on the tip towards plant cells finally here are a few desiccated gold DNA bullets ready to go
[03:44:36.520 --> 03:44:41.880]  straight into the gene gun cartridge holder or you can store them at four degrees until required
[03:44:41.880 --> 03:44:47.640]  the plastic bullet would hit a donut shaped plate with a hole in the middle and the tungsten would
[03:44:47.640 --> 03:44:53.000]  spray out the other end but the plastic bullet would stop and the plant cells in the bottom would
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:45:01.960]  be bombarded at gunshot velocities it turned out it worked that's not accurate no we use polymerase
[03:45:01.960 --> 03:45:08.200]  and we use um we use chemical primers to particularly with bacteria to insert genes into the right
[03:45:08.200 --> 03:45:14.280]  place they're not like ad hoc and zoning genes that wouldn't work and elementary genetics tells us
[03:45:14.280 --> 03:45:19.240]  if you put a piece of DNA in the wrong place it's just going to end up in an error like we anyone
[03:45:19.240 --> 03:45:22.680]  that knows coding knows if you just take a piece of code and put it somewhere else you get an error
[03:45:24.280 --> 03:45:30.040]  yeah well here I like this error yeah error here's the first safety tip when you're doing a debate
[03:45:30.040 --> 03:45:34.600]  especially when it's about scientists never uh never categorically say that something doesn't
[03:45:34.600 --> 03:45:40.600]  exist no matter how strange it sounds okay and that's part of the problem Rob is that you know
[03:45:40.600 --> 03:45:46.120]  they do not want to look at the full spectrum of things there's a very narrow narrative that
[03:45:46.120 --> 03:45:52.280]  they're selling people they have defined this and they don't really want to hear anything outside of
[03:45:52.280 --> 03:45:58.760]  their uh their orthodoxy right okay and that's been the path uh to they don't look at all sources
[03:45:58.760 --> 03:46:04.200]  yeah they look at their established line and what comes in you know I remember I somebody
[03:46:04.200 --> 03:46:07.400]  was commenting about something about Obama and I sent him a weekly standard arch they're like
[03:46:07.400 --> 03:46:12.440]  oh weekly standard well it's linked to sources it had like three sources in there and that's why
[03:46:12.440 --> 03:46:16.440]  I linked to it yeah send it out and it's like you know okay you don't like the weekly standard
[03:46:16.440 --> 03:46:20.200]  that doesn't mean you can say everything whatever they just because you don't like what they say
[03:46:20.200 --> 03:46:24.360]  it doesn't mean you can say it's all false the problem is and and she's a good example of this
[03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:31.240]  is this slavish devotion to conventional wisdom is what has has thrown us under the bus with science
[03:46:31.240 --> 03:46:35.640]  over and over again when you go back to the arguments with Galileo and the arguments with
[03:46:35.640 --> 03:46:40.280]  Louis Pasteur one man who said it was the center of the all these other people say of course that
[03:46:40.280 --> 03:46:45.560]  can't be right conventional wisdom says it's this and we you know this we know we got a picture on
[03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:50.040]  the wall that shows the earth in the center okay that's right you know whenever you've got science
[03:46:50.040 --> 03:46:55.000]  science should fundamentally be skeptical yeah and it should not accept anything as being done I mean
[03:46:55.000 --> 03:47:00.360]  the reason that nobody the reason Langley who was the preferred guy that was had all the credentials
[03:47:00.360 --> 03:47:04.440]  and they couldn't get a machine to fly and the Wright brothers could was because they went back
[03:47:04.440 --> 03:47:09.480]  and questioned the data that was in the tables and they went back and they did their own measurements
[03:47:09.480 --> 03:47:14.920]  right on lift and then they created their own wing that worked whereas Langley said well I know these
[03:47:14.920 --> 03:47:20.600]  came to me on a silver platter and it has to be right and that's what we see over and over again
[03:47:20.600 --> 03:47:25.720]  and and worse than that is the idea that they have to purge anybody that doesn't agree with
[03:47:25.720 --> 03:47:29.880]  their conventional wisdom or their orthodoxy and that's what science has become this whole
[03:47:29.880 --> 03:47:34.200]  thing about climate change has become a religion oh yeah and now it's like there's people saying
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:38.120]  the president needs to go after people senators are calling for people to be you have Rico used
[03:47:38.120 --> 03:47:41.160]  against them that's right you know if you speak out against it so you're not going to get as many
[03:47:41.160 --> 03:47:45.160]  people speaking out against it because there's already a culture of don't say anything you're not
[03:47:45.160 --> 03:47:50.600]  going to be tenured you're not going to get that position whatever exactly now so in the end though
[03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:55.480]  she does say hey i'm a scientist so i'm open to to anything but you know she has her beliefs but
[03:47:55.480 --> 03:47:59.080]  she says she's open so we'll see we'll see if she watches this video in response to it that'll be
[03:47:59.080 --> 03:48:04.120]  interesting yeah um i don't think she knows she's getting into what she said yes she'll probably
[03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:09.560]  get a lecture from uh what's it the guys named sinker chink chank whatever yeah yeah thank you
[03:48:09.560 --> 03:48:13.400]  girl thank you yeah she'll probably get to talk from him like look we don't talk to infowars
[03:48:15.480 --> 03:48:20.920]  makes us look back yeah uh the last uh clip uh when she was talking about back cherry we go to
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:25.560]  ask her about aspartame where it comes from she had no idea um even though i think she's done videos
[03:48:25.560 --> 03:48:32.040]  on aspartame too and uh but this last one is about vaccines so we hit the we hit the trinity we hit
[03:48:32.040 --> 03:48:38.200]  climate change vaccines and uh uh gmo's yeah and and glyphosate i've talked about glyphosate too with
[03:48:38.200 --> 03:48:42.520]  gmo's so we did hit hit all three subjects so i encourage people to go and watch that and spread
[03:48:42.520 --> 03:48:46.760]  that video around it'll be uh i think we're going to post it saturday morning on infowars but it's
[03:48:46.760 --> 03:48:50.840]  been out on facebook and youtube and all that let's play the last one it's on vaccines she talks
[03:48:50.840 --> 03:48:55.640]  that she goes right to polio and i actually show tables from london that showed when they stopped making
[03:48:55.640 --> 03:49:02.440]  it mandatory the pol the polio or not not polio uh the smallpox vaccine when they started not making
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:08.360]  it mandatory the death rate went down for polio well okay that's what i hadn't seen yeah should
[03:49:08.360 --> 03:49:13.240]  ever have a closed mind exactly and so and i had never seen that either i just from digging i've
[03:49:13.240 --> 03:49:17.160]  like oh look at this here's a table and i just scrolled through looked at i'm like oh i'm putting
[03:49:17.160 --> 03:49:22.600]  that in the video and and then i asked her had she heard about the 50 000 kids who became paralyzed
[03:49:22.600 --> 03:49:27.560]  in india after taking the polio vaccine hadn't heard of it well that was a big story yeah a few
[03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:32.840]  years ago hadn't heard of it maybe without the young turks that's right those those sites are
[03:49:32.840 --> 03:49:38.200]  are not or they're verboten as they say in germany so let's play the last ones on vaccines you also
[03:49:38.200 --> 03:49:43.480]  talk about vaccines right i do all right one of my favorite subjects so being a libertarian you would
[03:49:43.480 --> 03:49:47.800]  think people have the wherewithal to decide whether what they want to put in their bodies yeah we have
[03:49:47.800 --> 03:49:53.320]  to make it uh some things i think are so dangerous that they people just there's no reason for them
[03:49:53.320 --> 03:49:58.040]  so for example the smallpox vaccine i don't think that there is anyone ever that would suggest that
[03:49:58.040 --> 03:50:03.480]  not having smallpox in our lives is going to be a bad thing that was clearly a good vaccine to have
[03:50:03.480 --> 03:50:08.600]  but for things like influenza did you have a flu shot never the first two or when they're making
[03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:14.120]  it mandatory the first two uh how much money we have and decades and then look at it drop down
[03:50:14.120 --> 03:50:18.840]  after they didn't make it mandatory milder diseases where i think we should have a choice maybe i can
[03:50:18.840 --> 03:50:23.000]  still frame that when we come back that table guys we should all be vaccinated do you know there's
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:27.880]  people in india like whole villages that have been injected with the polio vaccine and then
[03:50:27.880 --> 03:50:32.360]  become crippled with polio like symptoms although they're not calling it polio are you aware of that
[03:50:32.360 --> 03:50:37.320]  i haven't heard of that particular case study but there is always a risk with any medical treatment
[03:50:37.320 --> 03:50:42.760]  but if you had cancer you'd probably want a doctor to go and help you and fix it i believe that the
[03:50:42.760 --> 03:50:50.360]  risk of uh negative effect from most vaccines is so low that it's better to have the vaccine
[03:50:50.360 --> 03:50:55.240]  but in many cases the risks are kind of yeah and of course there's a risk with any medical
[03:50:55.240 --> 03:51:00.040]  procedure but they're going to determine for you whether the risk is it's no secret that
[03:51:00.040 --> 03:51:05.560]  pathogens such as bacteria viruses moles and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human

[03:53:02.680 --> 03:53:08.440]  rid of my timeshare does your story go something like stacy's story goes here stacy now my husband
[03:53:08.440 --> 03:53:14.920]  and i went and visited a resort and they kind of attacked us and they kept sending more and more
[03:53:14.920 --> 03:53:18.760]  people and so we finally said yes and we bought this timeshare and then we were stuck in this
[03:53:18.760 --> 03:53:22.680]  timeshare that we couldn't get rid of and we tried all different ways they made it seem like it was
[03:53:22.680 --> 03:53:27.320]  this really great deal and when we said no originally and they brought the price down
[03:53:27.320 --> 03:53:31.480]  and then when we still said no they brought in the manager and they brought the price down even
[03:53:31.480 --> 03:53:34.520]  lower and they started breaking out in different ways to make it look like it was this really
[03:53:34.520 --> 03:53:39.400]  awesome deal the reality was it wasn't an awesome deal at all to cancel your timeshare contract

[03:54:15.960 --> 03:54:19.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show in our final segment i'm david night here with rob do and of
[03:54:19.640 --> 03:54:26.040]  course we're going to go back and talk about this debate that rob had with a with jade lovell who is
[03:54:26.040 --> 03:54:32.680]  the resident scientist i guess now for the young turks that's going to be going up on our youtube
[03:54:32.680 --> 03:54:37.640]  site soon also we're going to have tonight from the nightly news we're going to have a more formal
[03:54:37.640 --> 03:54:43.240]  presentation of the nobel peace prize to our president brock obama in celebration of the
[03:54:43.240 --> 03:54:47.320]  nearly one million people that he's been able to kill as part of his presidency
[03:54:47.320 --> 03:54:53.480]  and we have a new trump scandal that alex jones is currently talking about right now doing a facebook
[03:54:53.480 --> 03:54:58.120]  mentions of before i go back to rob just want to let you know that we also have a flash sale
[03:54:58.120 --> 03:55:05.240]  this is a brief sale usually these are for about 24 hours sometimes a little bit longer but sometimes
[03:55:05.240 --> 03:55:11.800]  less because it's based on available supply this flash sale is survival shield x2 nascent iodine
[03:55:11.800 --> 03:55:17.400]  37 off of retail and you'll find that at info wars life dot com of course we've talked many times
[03:55:17.400 --> 03:55:23.400]  about how the presence of iodine in the food supply they took it out of the salt when they put it
[03:55:23.400 --> 03:55:28.600]  back into this the food supply iq points went up as much as 15 points of course they like to do
[03:55:28.600 --> 03:55:34.360]  things like put fluoride into the water supply which they know causes a drop in iq points so
[03:55:34.360 --> 03:55:37.560]  that's what they like to do they like to take out the stuff that helps your iq put in the stuff that
[03:55:37.560 --> 03:55:42.600]  hurts your iq you can take care of and you have the ultimate responsibility for your health you
[03:55:42.600 --> 03:55:47.000]  need to educate yourself what things you can do to help yourself help your children and of course
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:54.760]  iodine is an essential element this is a great way to get a very pure form of iodine again it's
[03:55:54.760 --> 03:55:59.720]  from a 200 million year old salt crystals deep within the earth that they've mined out and you
[03:55:59.720 --> 03:56:05.720]  can find this now at info wars life dot com for 37 off retail and another quick sale we have a free
