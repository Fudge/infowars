[00:00.000 --> 00:06.680]  So the globalist for almost ten years, nine years, have been giving themselves zero percent
[00:06.680 --> 00:11.040]  interest, not to mention bank or bailouts that are just trillions of dollars to themselves,
[00:11.040 --> 00:12.440]  that taxpayers have to back up.
[00:12.440 --> 00:16.280]  So they plunged the economy, then we have to back up their bad debts, and then they
[00:16.280 --> 00:17.640]  turn around and take the money.
[00:17.640 --> 00:21.200]  We've loaned them and loaned it back to us at incredible interest.
[00:21.200 --> 00:26.880]  And so the first thing Trump did when he got in, just 16 days ago, he's only had like
[00:26.880 --> 00:29.920]  ten working days, but he's been working all 16.
[00:29.920 --> 00:35.320]  The first thing he did was to come in and say, let's start moving with banking regulations,
[00:35.320 --> 00:38.280]  let me get my Treasury Secretary in there.
[00:38.280 --> 00:43.440]  They have totally blocked all the money being given to small businesses and the individuals.
[00:43.440 --> 00:47.360]  Lending has just been shut off ever since the interest went to zero, because why should
[00:47.360 --> 00:48.360]  the banks do that?
[00:48.360 --> 00:53.400]  They're the first handlers of the money, so they get it at zero, but only select megabanks.
[00:53.400 --> 00:59.920]  Trump said, no, sir, we're going to give 0% interest to the little banks, the local banks,
[00:59.920 --> 01:05.440]  the regional banks, the private banks, the banks that aren't part of the insider groups.
[01:05.440 --> 01:12.040]  Not just the six big ones, not just a bunch of foreign banks, we're going to give 0%.
[01:12.040 --> 01:15.960]  And Trump's pressuring the Federal Reserve right now that is a consortium of private
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.800]  banks, but as an intergovernmental meeting group, it's just kind of the counsel of the
[01:20.800 --> 01:23.160]  private banks.
[01:23.160 --> 01:25.280]  He's pressuring them to keep it low.
[01:25.280 --> 01:27.480]  Not that's even good overall, generally.
[01:27.480 --> 01:32.600]  We need some interest, so people that save and invest make money.
[01:32.600 --> 01:37.880]  But while America and the world is in this long depression slash recession for the average
[01:37.880 --> 01:42.640]  person, it's time for Main Street to get a bubble.
[01:42.640 --> 01:46.040]  Because when Main Street gets a bubble, you actually get a bridge built, you actually
[01:46.040 --> 01:49.920]  get a business built, you actually get some jobs, you actually get some money saved, you
[01:49.920 --> 01:54.560]  actually get some cars bought, some restaurants visited, some haircuts paid for, some new
[01:54.560 --> 01:57.400]  clothes, a new coat, some new shoes.
[01:57.400 --> 02:02.040]  Yes, these are dangerous bubbles, but they already created a mega bubble nobody can get
[02:02.040 --> 02:07.560]  out of unless we get the average person out of the bubble, because that's where you are
[02:07.560 --> 02:09.200]  able to rebuild an economy.
[02:09.200 --> 02:12.320]  But without getting some money to those people, it's not going to happen.
[02:12.320 --> 02:14.480]  This is 101 economics.
[02:14.480 --> 02:21.640]  Trump should be a superstar, loved by the general public or the average poor person.
[02:21.640 --> 02:27.240]  The average poor person is a democratic supporter, especially on the east and west coast, and
[02:27.240 --> 02:31.640]  they just really think all their prosperity comes from the government.
[02:31.640 --> 02:35.160]  They don't even care the stock markets up because they don't own stock.
[02:35.160 --> 02:38.880]  They don't understand that those businesses are hiring a lot of times based off how the
[02:38.880 --> 02:39.880]  stock's doing.
[02:39.880 --> 02:43.320]  So there's danger in the Trump euphoria.
[02:43.320 --> 02:45.040]  There's danger in a bubble.
[02:45.040 --> 02:48.720]  There's danger in him betting on he can supercharge things, but here's the deal.
[02:48.720 --> 02:54.160]  The danger of not doing it is a guaranteed ongoing worldwide recession slash depression
[02:54.160 --> 02:57.720]  that's meant to consolidate total control of pick winners and losers.
[02:57.720 --> 03:02.000]  So I've been hammering on this for nine years, having economist after economist on.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.160]  You've heard Ron Paul, big pessimist for every politician.
[03:05.160 --> 03:11.120]  He says, quote, a week ago, Donald Trump's doing a great job on the economy.
[03:11.120 --> 03:17.680]  I think it's too little too late, but he's doing a fantastic job.
[03:17.680 --> 03:22.760]  All is one of the least complimenting people out there, okay?
[03:22.760 --> 03:30.680]  He's very, very not mechanical, but he's just very, very dedicated to this being very, very
[03:30.680 --> 03:31.680]  machine like.
[03:31.680 --> 03:33.360]  There's a headline exclusive.
[03:33.360 --> 03:36.040]  Ron Paul says Trump is trying to stop global collapse.
[03:36.040 --> 03:38.280]  Folks, it's because he is.
[03:38.280 --> 03:43.400]  Listen, I've seen this played out this globalist program over and over again in other countries.
[03:43.400 --> 03:51.280]  They have an admitted blueprint in 2002, Joseph Sticklets, who had won the Nobel Prize twice,
[03:51.280 --> 03:54.080]  won three economics, left the World Bank as our chief economist.
[03:54.080 --> 03:58.200]  He said, I will not be part of the criminal activity taking place and trying to make the
[03:58.200 --> 03:59.200]  public poor.
[03:59.200 --> 04:01.880]  And it was the plan of the IMF and World Bank.
[04:01.880 --> 04:06.000]  Again, international meeting houses of mega banks.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.280]  They're just the front groups, governmental name.
[04:08.280 --> 04:13.560]  It's the International Federal Reserve, basically, deciding to implode now the first world and
[04:13.560 --> 04:18.680]  make us debt slaves, kill the engines of production, the engines of liberty, the engines of upper
[04:18.680 --> 04:21.800]  mobility, and have a giant consolidation for political control.
[04:21.800 --> 04:26.440]  I mean, we don't want just a bunch of billionaires and trillionaire globalists that then rule
[04:26.440 --> 04:29.720]  on like mountain tops that are all high tech and have electricity.
[04:29.720 --> 04:34.600]  We're down here like it's just till Chestew's Romania or Venezuela and don't have electricity
[04:34.600 --> 04:36.920]  most of the time and have kids starving on the streets.
[04:36.920 --> 04:39.880]  But that's the management tool of the globalist.
[04:39.880 --> 04:43.800]  That's what we're headed into.
[04:43.800 --> 04:51.280]  It's Monday, February 16th, 2017, we're going to be back.
[04:51.280 --> 04:54.480]  This is Ashley Beckford for Infowars.com.
[04:54.480 --> 04:58.120]  This is your tip of the week, article for Merkola.com.
[04:58.120 --> 05:02.400]  Fluoride, the only drug intentionally added to your tap water.
[05:02.400 --> 05:08.200]  Fluoride is an endocrine disrupting neurotoxic and bone weakening substance that the FDA
[05:08.200 --> 05:13.600]  defines as a drug when used to prevent disease because unlike the minerals we need, humans
[05:13.600 --> 05:17.840]  have no known physiological requirement for fluoride.
[05:17.840 --> 05:23.080]  Sodium fluoride, long known as an effective roach poison, is added to tablets and drops
[05:23.080 --> 05:25.680]  for the purpose of preventing tooth decay.
[05:25.680 --> 05:29.320]  In short, sodium fluoride is not a nutritional supplement.
[05:29.320 --> 05:32.480]  It is a prescription drug and a dangerous one.
[05:32.480 --> 05:38.840]  FDA recently announced that marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates
[05:38.840 --> 05:44.720]  federal law because FDA never approved these products as either safe or effective.
[05:44.720 --> 05:46.160]  Don't use fluoride.
[05:46.160 --> 05:51.600]  Use the Alexa Pure water filter to remove contaminants from your water supply.
[05:51.600 --> 05:52.960]  This is Alex Jones.
[05:52.960 --> 05:57.320]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid
[05:57.320 --> 06:01.400]  products of 2017 and seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[06:01.400 --> 06:05.080]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from
[06:05.080 --> 06:07.320]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[06:07.320 --> 06:12.000]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.360]  appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[06:16.360 --> 06:20.720]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment,
[06:20.720 --> 06:21.720]  even airplanes.
[06:21.720 --> 06:25.680]  The system provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity, allowing you to create
[06:25.680 --> 06:29.280]  your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[06:29.280 --> 06:33.880]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[06:33.880 --> 06:37.280]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[06:37.280 --> 06:39.360]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[06:50.960 --> 06:53.440]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[06:53.440 --> 06:54.960]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[06:54.960 --> 06:58.680]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.

[07:11.720 --> 07:16.320]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our
[07:16.320 --> 07:17.480]  modern diets.
[07:17.480 --> 07:22.880]  Secret 12 by InfoWarsLive is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake
[07:22.880 --> 07:25.320]  and support your body's natural systems.

[07:30.320 --> 07:34.120]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding
[07:34.120 --> 07:39.480]  in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[07:39.480 --> 07:43.120]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[07:52.320 --> 08:03.760]  We are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[08:03.760 --> 08:07.640]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[08:07.640 --> 08:10.440]  This is the heart of 1776.
[08:10.440 --> 08:15.920]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about growing up the White House.
[08:15.920 --> 08:21.840]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend
[08:21.840 --> 08:27.960]  in office.
[08:27.960 --> 08:34.120]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[08:34.120 --> 08:39.520]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.000]  Donald Trump is now president of the United States.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.920]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[08:48.920 --> 08:54.720]  From the bloodlines of the InfoWarsLive, it's Alex Jones.
[08:54.720 --> 09:04.160]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please, all my stop.
[09:04.160 --> 09:10.320]  And if you're not a TV viewer, for radio listeners, that's a compilation just recently of white
[09:10.320 --> 09:17.400]  people being attacked just for being white and associating that with Trump and CNN saying
[09:17.400 --> 09:21.840]  big deal, quit whining about it.
[09:21.840 --> 09:22.840]  That's the culture.
[09:22.840 --> 09:23.840]  That's the mindset.
[09:23.840 --> 09:27.960]  That's the system that's being sold right now.
[09:27.960 --> 09:32.960]  Obviously, I'm going to talk about the Super Bowl last night and the huge upset from behind
[09:32.960 --> 09:36.560]  victory.
[09:36.560 --> 09:45.240]  And how MSDM is now equating it with white supremacy that the team that Trump loves
[09:45.240 --> 09:55.560]  won because this ties into the fact that sports is simulated politics, simulated combat, simulated
[09:55.560 --> 09:56.560]  war.
[09:56.560 --> 10:02.840]  And finally, the public is so dumbed down that in their ultimate ignorance, they finally
[10:02.840 --> 10:08.160]  found truth in that the whole thing's gone full circle now, that they understand what
[10:08.160 --> 10:14.080]  sports is to begin with to divert them from politics, but things have gotten so debased
[10:14.080 --> 10:21.200]  that now they've projected politics onto it when it was always designed to distract them
[10:21.200 --> 10:24.600]  from politics.
[10:24.600 --> 10:26.840]  Very interesting, isn't it?
[10:26.840 --> 10:36.000]  But again, because they're protecting politics onto it, it's completely moronic because the
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.480]  sports are to distract from real issues.
[10:39.480 --> 10:45.160]  So when you finally project politics on it when it's not based in reality, when it's
[10:45.160 --> 10:54.640]  a primitive form of virtual reality, then the political parallels are ridiculous because
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.680]  it's already based in the political systems fraud that if you voted for Trump, you're
[10:59.680 --> 11:03.720]  inherently racist.
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.720]  And then you even get some of the white supremacists and people coming out saying that Tom Brady
[11:07.720 --> 11:16.400]  is the Aryan avatar after Patriots win Super Bowl, jumping on the bandwagon, adding gasoline
[11:16.400 --> 11:17.840]  to the fire.
[11:17.840 --> 11:25.040]  So all sides are basically powering up from all of this and the hijacking of the giant
[11:25.040 --> 11:29.880]  bread and circus gladiatorial diversion.
[11:29.880 --> 11:35.120]  So you know, the political systems coming down when they're big distractions now even
[11:35.120 --> 11:41.000]  get turned into political events and political movements.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.680]  So that story's up on infowars.com.
[11:44.680 --> 11:50.080]  Also report ISIS offering recruits protection, payments and free passions to Europe.
[11:50.080 --> 11:55.800]  Yeah, ISIS said three years ago, they were going to intensify the flooding of Europe
[11:55.800 --> 12:02.480]  and the United States with ISIS recruits and use that as a smoke screen to get their people
[12:02.480 --> 12:03.480]  in place.
[12:03.480 --> 12:07.680]  RT is now reporting on this, but this is an absolute fact.
[12:07.680 --> 12:15.040]  And how dare President Trump come out and simply say, well, Obama banned four countries.
[12:15.040 --> 12:22.040]  I'm banning seven countries just for three months until we get real vetting in place
[12:22.040 --> 12:23.840]  because there's not real vetting going on.
[12:23.840 --> 12:24.840]  That's admitted.
[12:24.840 --> 12:31.480]  But no matter how many gun attacks, knife attacks, car attacks, truck attacks happen,
[12:31.480 --> 12:34.720]  no matter how many hundreds and hundreds of people die a month, how many rapes there
[12:34.720 --> 12:36.760]  are shootings, it doesn't matter.
[12:36.760 --> 12:42.960]  This is the globalist plan to bring down the West and they're moving forward with it regardless.
[12:42.960 --> 12:47.040]  Doesn't matter if it's totally constitutional as another major federal judge ruled what
[12:47.040 --> 12:48.040]  Trump is doing.
[12:48.040 --> 12:53.400]  They found another globalist judge to say it's unconstitutional and the Ninth Circuit,
[12:53.400 --> 12:58.240]  the most globalist, socialist, communist in the country in San Francisco, the city that
[12:58.240 --> 13:01.920]  says let illegals vote in their court rulings.
[13:01.920 --> 13:04.800]  They say what Trump's doing is wrong.
[13:04.800 --> 13:05.800]  They're not liberals.
[13:05.800 --> 13:12.120]  They're conquering you with giant, unwashed Third World masses that are hungry, that are
[13:12.120 --> 13:18.120]  desperate and will vote and work and do whatever they're told to be here in this country.
[13:18.120 --> 13:23.040]  Even if they're helping drive down the wages and destroy it in the long run, it doesn't
[13:23.040 --> 13:29.200]  matter because today there is food.
[13:29.200 --> 13:36.120]  This is the silent dream scenario that more and more we're entering into.
[13:36.120 --> 13:42.960]  Whistleblower, top scientist, NOAA scientists manipulated temperature data to make global
[13:42.960 --> 13:45.240]  warming seem worse.
[13:45.240 --> 13:48.760]  Now you as a listener already know this, but the documents have been released, how they
[13:48.760 --> 13:57.000]  were hiding the decline and the Daily Colors reporting it, the Daily Mail is reporting
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.160]  it, how world leaders were duped in investing billions over manipulated global warming data.
[14:03.160 --> 14:14.520]  They didn't just put thermostats and temperature readers out on hot tarmacs to manipulate the
[14:14.520 --> 14:17.360]  data and make it look like temperature was going on more than it was.
[14:17.360 --> 14:22.800]  They also just made up temperature data and thermometers all over the country that didn't
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.520]  exist and they premeditated engage in fraud.
[14:26.520 --> 14:31.040]  This came out in the East Anglia emails six years ago in Climate Gate where they said
[14:31.040 --> 14:34.280]  we've got to hide the decline.
[14:34.280 --> 14:39.000]  It hasn't been warming for 14 years and the last three it's been cooling.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.280]  They said what do we do?
[14:40.280 --> 14:49.720]  From the directive to over a thousand universities to hide the decline and since then they have
[14:49.720 --> 15:04.600]  been hiding the decline at a murderous rate, at a highly accelerated rate.
[15:04.600 --> 15:09.200]  You know I've got news here in front of me that I started reading about last night that
[15:09.200 --> 15:16.960]  it physically made me sick and it makes me sick that my fellow humans are this nasty,
[15:16.960 --> 15:25.480]  this conniving, this evil and they've come up with plans like this.
[15:25.480 --> 15:35.960]  Where I live here in Austin, Texas has been studied and actuaried and looked at for more
[15:35.960 --> 15:48.840]  than 25 years as the global model city of the future.
[15:48.840 --> 15:56.040]  And when you actually read what they say they're going to do under Agenda 21 and you realize
[15:56.040 --> 16:02.960]  it's only being done in one Chinese city, one Japanese city, one German city and one
[16:02.960 --> 16:08.560]  US city and you read what they're doing and what they've got planned.
[16:08.560 --> 16:18.760]  It is so horrible that it just makes me want to cry.
[16:18.760 --> 16:29.960]  It's so premeditated, so obvious, so documented, so arrogant, so naked, so terrible that I
[16:29.960 --> 16:34.480]  don't even want to sit here and talk about it and not give it the true justice of making
[16:34.480 --> 16:40.840]  a 30 minute special report documenting every facet of it, but as fast as I can research
[16:40.840 --> 16:48.240]  it's so big, it's so old, it's so planned that it just goes on and on and on and on
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.440]  worse and worse and worse and worse.
[16:52.440 --> 17:00.600]  Then you find out how many people are involved in it and then you realize about half the
[17:00.600 --> 17:08.040]  people fleeing San Francisco and Los Angeles to come to Austin aren't useful duped idiots
[17:08.040 --> 17:13.040]  that are leaving the system that failed that they helped bring down.
[17:13.040 --> 17:22.720]  They know it's all a big scam and are coming here to collude with it, to collaborate with
[17:22.720 --> 17:29.160]  it and to help suck everything dry and rip everybody off and then move on in 20, 30
[17:29.160 --> 17:30.160]  years.
[17:30.160 --> 17:35.800]  They even train their kids how to do it.
[17:35.800 --> 17:40.240]  That's why I used to go to these smart growth conferences and 21 conferences and I'd say
[17:40.240 --> 17:45.560]  this is a giant scam, you're raising rents and you're hurting people and you're creating
[17:45.560 --> 17:51.160]  monopolies and they would just go get out of my way scum, of course we are.
[17:51.160 --> 18:00.040]  Listen to this one, tell us something we don't know and they're just all in there in these
[18:00.040 --> 18:05.560]  frenzied meetings just lobbying the city at the convention center just like all laughing
[18:05.560 --> 18:14.520]  and cackling and just rubbing their hands together to collude and rob everybody's.
[18:14.520 --> 18:15.520]  What am I talking about?
[18:15.520 --> 18:19.480]  Well it ties into how world leaders were duped.
[18:19.480 --> 18:27.320]  Whenever the fraud comes out it's oh the leaders didn't know they were duped.
[18:27.320 --> 18:35.920]  No ladies and gentlemen, that's not what I'm getting into.
[18:35.920 --> 18:40.960]  Nico I think I actually gave you my stack on that, oh here it is, I gave them the stack
[18:40.960 --> 18:48.280]  because I told them I said I want to do more research on this.
[18:48.280 --> 18:51.040]  It's called Code Next.
[18:51.040 --> 18:55.360]  That's the trendy name for Agenda 21 in Austin, Texas.
[18:55.360 --> 19:00.800]  Code Next takes Austin to another dimension, do we really want to go there and you read
[19:00.800 --> 19:07.120]  it and this writer from Affordable Austin gets it and says it's like a Stephen King
[19:07.120 --> 19:12.600]  novel when you read it and you're like how do people come up with this stuff?
[19:12.600 --> 19:20.000]  Wait till you learn what Next Code does and this is the model for your town next but it
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.200]  is just so diabolical.
[19:22.200 --> 19:24.720]  Now let me stop right there.
[19:24.720 --> 19:28.920]  I got some really bad news for everybody but getting ahead of this bad news is what's
[19:28.920 --> 19:37.840]  going to stop it but those of you that have been rooting against Trump, all the big throngs
[19:37.840 --> 19:42.280]  of dupes, that's why they're losers, they get conned by every new con game, they buy
[19:42.280 --> 19:51.280]  lottery tickets you know it's that type of person, well you might get what you want.
[19:51.280 --> 19:56.640]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[19:56.640 --> 20:00.760]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's
[20:00.760 --> 20:02.520]  medical expenses.

[22:50.200 --> 22:52.720]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[22:52.720 --> 22:56.880]  The active ingredient in turmeric known as curcumin is poorly absorbed into the cells
[22:56.880 --> 22:58.680]  due to its large particle size.
[22:58.680 --> 23:03.480]  But now, one planet nutrition has the answer for this powerful anti-inflammatory.
[23:03.480 --> 23:24.480]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark US government study
[23:24.480 --> 23:29.600]  confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[24:11.200 --> 24:16.680]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[24:16.680 --> 24:21.000]  It's Monday, already the 6th day of February 2017.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.360]  This is a short six-minute segment.
[24:24.360 --> 24:30.520]  I'm going to get into the whole mega attack on Trump and the people of the world, not
[24:30.520 --> 24:34.960]  just America in the next segment because I can't do it justice in this segment.
[24:34.960 --> 24:40.280]  In the next segment, I'll also answer Nancy Pelosi's evil question, which she does the
[24:40.280 --> 24:41.600]  answer to.
[24:41.600 --> 24:46.560]  What does Vladimir Putin have on Trump?
[24:46.560 --> 24:48.680]  What does Vladimir Putin have on Trump?
[24:48.680 --> 24:56.240]  Well, I'll tell you what Vladimir Putin has on Trump as well when we come back.
[24:56.240 --> 24:59.680]  Again, you can see the video at EMFWars.com.
[24:59.680 --> 25:03.760]  It's Pelosi calls for FBI investigation to find out what the Russians have on Donald
[25:03.760 --> 25:04.760]  Trump.
[25:04.760 --> 25:09.760]  Yes, all because he doesn't want to have war with Russia and has been advised on a new
[25:09.760 --> 25:15.400]  global strategy to save the nation state and reverse an engineered global depression
[25:15.400 --> 25:19.600]  that's meant to convert the planet into poor people and into prosperity.
[25:19.600 --> 25:24.600]  See, I can't ever keep a secret, can I, from the audience?
[25:24.600 --> 25:26.400]  Well, I can keep secrets good.
[25:26.400 --> 25:30.720]  I'm just not good at saying something's coming up and then giving you the answer.
[25:30.720 --> 25:35.440]  But I'll actually give you the rest of the story in detail coming up.
[25:35.440 --> 25:39.720]  Milo Yiannopoulos is popping in for a little bit in the second hour.
[25:39.720 --> 25:42.040]  Then I'm going to open phones.
[25:42.040 --> 25:46.720]  He'll be on to really get into his book for a full hour on Wednesday.
[25:46.720 --> 25:53.200]  He's invited me up to one of his events, all the socialists and brainwash snowflakes blowing
[25:53.200 --> 25:54.200]  up and going crazy.
[25:54.200 --> 25:57.840]  So I guess I'm probably going to have to do that in the next few weeks.
[25:57.840 --> 25:58.840]  So that should be interesting.
[25:58.840 --> 26:05.600]  Of course, he has the number one book right now on the charts and that's Dangerous Faggot.
[26:05.600 --> 26:11.920]  And again, they want to be able to take all these terms and use them and be politically
[26:11.920 --> 26:12.920]  incorrect.
[26:12.920 --> 26:14.720]  He calls himself Dangerous Faggot.
[26:14.720 --> 26:18.640]  The politically correct one, he put the full title out, it's called Dangerous.
[26:18.640 --> 26:22.560]  And you know, the point is they want to be able to push all these memes and cultural
[26:22.560 --> 26:28.960]  morays that they say the control left owns, but they don't own who people are, what they
[26:28.960 --> 26:32.560]  stand for or the complexity of the average individual.
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.440]  Just because you have a particular sexual persuasion doesn't mean then that you hate
[26:37.440 --> 26:39.280]  people who don't have that persuasion.
[26:39.280 --> 26:46.160]  And that's what the gay movement has become to a great extent, at least according to MSM,
[26:46.160 --> 26:49.360]  and that you must then adopt all these ideas that they say you must adopt.
[26:49.360 --> 26:53.000]  And so whether you love Milo or hate Milo, I think he's a very articulate, funny guy.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.080]  And he's certainly gotten his point across whether you love him or hate him, he's been
[26:56.080 --> 27:00.560]  effective and he has a right to free speech.
[27:00.560 --> 27:03.920]  Just like Roger Stone does, just like I do, just like Matt Drudge does, just like everybody
[27:03.920 --> 27:04.920]  else does.
[27:04.920 --> 27:06.520]  And they're trying to end that and that's what's dangerous.
[27:06.520 --> 27:19.440]  But beyond ending free speech, under their next code systems, they are openly establishing
[27:19.440 --> 27:27.280]  a planetary system of total control where the individual has absolutely no rights and
[27:27.280 --> 27:30.040]  where your very environment is a prison.
[27:30.040 --> 27:33.320]  And they admit that.
[27:33.320 --> 27:34.480]  Everything is tracked, everything is traced.
[27:34.480 --> 27:37.360]  However, I told you the NSA was listening to everything you were doing with keywords
[27:37.360 --> 27:41.360]  and had hidden microphones and cameras and stuff 20 years ago when I was a crazy man,
[27:41.360 --> 27:45.080]  Snowden comes out three years ago and confirms everything I told you.
[27:45.080 --> 27:49.800]  You go see the Snowden movie, you're like, this is police state 2000 from 1999.
[27:49.800 --> 27:51.240]  How did all the shows know this?
[27:51.240 --> 27:58.720]  NSA, whistleblowers, some of which came on the show and then I would get physically
[27:58.720 --> 28:05.840]  attacked or audited or debt-threaded for doing it.
[28:05.840 --> 28:13.080]  I had no idea how original the work I was doing truly was, but look at the code next
[28:13.080 --> 28:18.560]  if you want to understand the global model of Agent 21 simply using zoning to fully
[28:18.560 --> 28:20.560]  enslave you and your family.
[28:20.560 --> 28:26.320]  And I love Texas, but they have an admitted plan under code next to take over Austin and
[28:26.320 --> 28:31.920]  take over the surrounding towns like a cancer, take over the I-35 and I-45 corridors and
[28:31.920 --> 28:37.600]  fully bring in the third world population to drive down wages, to house them in overpriced
[28:37.600 --> 28:42.640]  coffin apartments and to bring down the standard of living massively, then use those political
[28:42.640 --> 28:49.320]  groups as a checkmate on the rest of the population and kill the middle class once and for all.
[28:49.320 --> 28:51.600]  Which is always the authoritarian plan.
[28:51.600 --> 28:57.480]  Briefly, I got a call last night and the great folks over at my Patriot Supply that produced
[28:57.480 --> 29:01.720]  the Alexa Pure said you cannot offer it for 25% off anymore.
[29:01.720 --> 29:02.920]  It has to end today.
[29:02.920 --> 29:04.400]  The contract says so.
[29:04.400 --> 29:07.520]  Our other suppliers are complaining because there's really not much profit at this level.
[29:07.520 --> 29:09.400]  Well, I have lost leaders.
[29:09.400 --> 29:16.120]  And Tim Frosier said, listen, one more day, one more day, 25% off Alexa Pure Breeze, leading
[29:16.120 --> 29:18.680]  competitors $400, $149.
[29:18.680 --> 29:22.560]  Same thing with the water filtration systems, you cannot beat the Alexa Pure water filtration
[29:22.560 --> 29:24.960]  systems and the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[29:24.960 --> 29:28.760]  At the regular price, it's the best deal out there at infowarstore.com.
[29:28.760 --> 29:30.440]  Same thing with storeable foods there.
[29:30.440 --> 29:35.400]  But with it at these discounts, it only happens once or twice a year, you can't beat it, infowarstore.com
[29:35.400 --> 29:37.160]  and support the broadcast.
[29:37.160 --> 29:40.640]  But the key is, don't trust the globalist, filter your water, filter your air.
[29:40.640 --> 29:41.920]  We're on the march.
[29:41.920 --> 29:42.920]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:42.920 --> 29:43.920]  Do you want to take control of the environment?
[29:43.920 --> 29:44.920]  Alex Jones.
[29:44.920 --> 29:45.920]  You've got to take control of yours.
[29:45.920 --> 29:55.640]  We have the new product at infowarstore.com, Biotru Selenium.
[29:55.640 --> 29:58.720]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium.
[29:58.720 --> 30:05.320]  And just recently, we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from
[30:05.320 --> 30:06.320]  mustard seed extract.
[30:06.320 --> 30:11.240]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[30:11.240 --> 30:12.240]  body.
[30:12.240 --> 30:16.440]  It balances the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[30:16.440 --> 30:18.920]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[30:18.920 --> 30:22.880]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[30:22.880 --> 30:23.880]  all over the body.
[30:23.880 --> 30:29.960]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[30:29.960 --> 30:35.280]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[30:35.280 --> 30:37.040]  I'm taking it now every day.
[30:37.040 --> 30:38.040]  This is so key.

[30:51.720 --> 30:54.240]  Intermeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[30:54.240 --> 30:58.400]  The active ingredient intermeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells
[30:58.400 --> 31:00.200]  due to its large particle size.

[32:53.480 --> 32:56.120]  Waging war on corruption.
[32:56.120 --> 33:12.280]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[33:12.280 --> 33:16.400]  Communist China is buying up the stock market, the mercantiles in Hollywood and producing
[33:16.400 --> 33:25.800]  big budget films directed by the director of Transformers with an escape from New York.
[33:25.800 --> 33:30.600]  That line where Donald Trump's the dictator and the Communist Chinese are going to take
[33:30.600 --> 33:33.120]  him out.
[33:33.120 --> 33:40.360]  No nation would ever put up with such outrageous rubbing our faces in the dirt, but the globalists,
[33:40.360 --> 33:48.920]  they just think that Trump is a hiccup along the way on their total quest for planetary
[33:48.920 --> 33:51.240]  domination and domination of the individual.
[33:51.240 --> 33:56.440]  So you're not going to see this on Fox and Friends, you're not going to hear about this
[33:56.440 --> 34:02.920]  even on The Bill O'Reilly Show, and I don't say that to differentiate myself from Fox.
[34:02.920 --> 34:08.480]  I say it in sadness because I wish this info was getting out of the general public.
[34:08.480 --> 34:13.840]  But it's hidden actually in the establishment's publications like Bloomberg, The Associated
[34:13.840 --> 34:15.640]  Press and others.
[34:15.640 --> 34:21.680]  In fact, the only place that's talking about it is the New York Post, strangely enough,
[34:21.680 --> 34:25.440]  and they're getting it right, but only part of it.
[34:25.440 --> 34:28.320]  And that's the bad news, folks.
[34:28.320 --> 34:31.560]  Yes, I've had a lot of exuberance.
[34:31.560 --> 34:35.720]  In fact, none of it has been irrational because really great things are happening.
[34:35.720 --> 34:43.040]  People are waking up, but globalists at Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan that run the show are
[34:43.040 --> 34:44.040]  coming against him.
[34:44.040 --> 34:51.280]  Now, before I get into this news, boy, it sure felt good for CNN and Fox and MSNBC and
[34:51.280 --> 34:55.360]  other talk show hosts to say, oh, look at the Trump supporters.
[34:55.360 --> 35:01.920]  They've been duped why he's got three former senior individuals from Goldman Sachs inside
[35:01.920 --> 35:04.000]  of his administration.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.280]  Why everybody knows Goldman Sachs is the bad guy.
[35:07.280 --> 35:09.560]  Why Alex Jones says it all the time.
[35:09.560 --> 35:16.760]  I've seen hundreds of news articles where they shortle and laugh with glee and rub their
[35:16.760 --> 35:22.280]  hands together and say, look at the sellout Alex Jones claiming Goldman Sachs was bad,
[35:22.280 --> 35:28.400]  but now his boy, Trump, the evil billionaire, is stacking his administration with rich people
[35:28.400 --> 35:31.760]  and Goldman Sachs to screw you over.
[35:31.760 --> 35:33.760]  And the left howls with anger.
[35:33.760 --> 35:39.440]  And one of the only cogent points they would make to me at the different marches I've attended,
[35:39.440 --> 35:45.440]  like the women's march in D.C. on January 21st, is you're an ethnic white male.
[35:45.440 --> 35:47.840]  Well, I guess that's accurate.
[35:47.840 --> 35:48.840]  How do you feel now?
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.520]  He's got a bunch of Goldman Sachs people.
[35:52.520 --> 35:57.360]  And as I always said, well, let's go look at Bannon and Mnuchin and one of the other
[35:57.360 --> 35:58.960]  people.
[35:58.960 --> 36:02.080]  All of them have been against globalism.
[36:02.080 --> 36:05.080]  All of them have tried to expand cheaper housing.
[36:05.080 --> 36:08.520]  All of them have tried to have fair trade deals here in the United States.
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.640]  And all of them were on the inside at the highest levels and watched it happening.
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.640]  And for decades have been speaking out against it.
[36:17.640 --> 36:23.080]  And now Trump gets in, he tries to cut taxes to the poor, the middle class, the new vareish.
[36:23.080 --> 36:25.080]  He tries to cut our corporate income tax.
[36:25.080 --> 36:27.200]  So it brings back over a trillion dollars here.
[36:27.200 --> 36:31.040]  The big corporations wrote that because they didn't want U.S. competition.
[36:31.040 --> 36:34.400]  They wanted it to be exclusionary because they had sweetheart deals with China so they
[36:34.400 --> 36:35.840]  could leave.
[36:35.840 --> 36:37.960]  And he moves to get us out of the carbon tax.
[36:37.960 --> 36:40.240]  The Paris agreements that are unconstitutional.
[36:40.240 --> 36:44.520]  He kills the TPP that literally just took over all of our sovereignty.
[36:44.520 --> 36:48.200]  He begins renegotiating NAFTA and GATT.
[36:48.200 --> 36:50.320]  He has to do that because those were laws passed by Congress.
[36:50.320 --> 36:52.560]  He's doing everything right.
[36:52.560 --> 36:57.920]  He tells the central banks, you've hoarded trillions and trillions and trillions of taxpayer
[36:57.920 --> 37:03.680]  money in bailouts and not loaned any of it out to the public.
[37:03.680 --> 37:10.320]  We're now going to loan it out at very low interest rates to get the economy going.
[37:10.320 --> 37:16.080]  Now previous presidents would order more bailouts for foreign banks and they'd follow it.
[37:16.080 --> 37:19.120]  But the Federal Reserve's saying, oh no, we're private.
[37:19.120 --> 37:20.640]  They always said they weren't.
[37:20.640 --> 37:24.080]  We're going to do what we want now, the New York Fed that actually runs it.
[37:24.080 --> 37:30.040]  Your regional banks are a totally separate system of the Fed, a subgroup that just controls
[37:30.040 --> 37:34.320]  the cash and the currency and implements the centralized private regulations.
[37:34.320 --> 37:36.440]  But I don't want to give a history lesson here.
[37:36.440 --> 37:37.440]  Here's the big news.
[37:37.440 --> 37:43.360]  Do you want a drum roll?
[37:43.360 --> 37:47.840]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are putting out bad news on the street and bad news to their
[37:47.840 --> 37:50.680]  investors to drive down the stock market.
[37:50.680 --> 37:52.320]  They're announcing the Trump rally's over.
[37:52.320 --> 37:55.720]  They're doing everything they can to throw a wet blanket on it and they're announcing
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.480]  that they're going to start jacking up interest rates, which has already begun to make sure
[37:59.480 --> 38:04.360]  you don't get any of your own taxpayer money back that they hoard to be able to give those
[38:04.360 --> 38:07.240]  loans.
[38:07.240 --> 38:14.520]  And they are really pushing as hard as they can publicly to kill the Trump recovery.
[38:14.520 --> 38:21.520]  And they're now having Paul Ryan, their blue-eyed angel of death that presides over this economy,
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.080]  the Speaker of the House saying, we're not going to be looking at tax cuts this year,
[38:26.080 --> 38:29.720]  not even not being next year.
[38:29.720 --> 38:32.280]  This country is in cardiac arrest.
[38:32.280 --> 38:33.560]  Trump has defibrillators out.
[38:33.560 --> 38:35.920]  He got them on our chest.
[38:35.920 --> 38:41.400]  And now Paul Ryan's trying to keep them from pulling the trigger.
[38:41.400 --> 38:46.120]  Just the announcement that he was going to defibrillate, that he was going to give mouth
[38:46.120 --> 38:52.200]  to mouth, that Trump was going to try to get our heart going again, got the heart starting
[38:52.200 --> 39:00.120]  to go, and now it's starting to stop and they are celebrating with intense pleasure.
[39:00.120 --> 39:01.640]  Let me give you a few of the headlines.
[39:01.640 --> 39:04.720]  Delaying Trump's tax cut is a huge risk.
[39:04.720 --> 39:11.320]  And the New York Post editorial board goes on to say, this will kill growth and we need
[39:11.320 --> 39:12.720]  this right now.
[39:12.720 --> 39:14.360]  We are stalled out.
[39:14.360 --> 39:16.720]  Let me give you what's happening.
[39:16.720 --> 39:22.440]  Bloomberg is celebrating Goldman Sachs says Trump rally has been curbed.
[39:22.440 --> 39:23.840]  That's right.
[39:23.840 --> 39:28.360]  You got to curb that rally and they admit they've been trying to do it.
[39:28.360 --> 39:31.880]  Goldman Sachs, I thought Goldman Sachs ran his White House.
[39:31.880 --> 39:36.480]  That's why he's killing TPP, their master plan, killing all their programs, killing
[39:36.480 --> 39:39.040]  globalism, killing one-sided trade deals.
[39:39.040 --> 39:46.680]  Oh, because they're openly against him because they gave 100% of their money to Hillary and
[39:46.680 --> 39:50.240]  0, 0, 0 to Trump.
[39:50.240 --> 39:55.120]  Oh, but I know having a recovery and having a future doesn't matter to mainline conservatives
[39:55.120 --> 39:56.120]  and liberals.
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.880]  They just want to be able to walk up to me on the street and say, you're a sellout.
[39:59.880 --> 40:03.040]  Donald Trump's for Goldman Sachs.
[40:03.040 --> 40:05.680]  It just feels good to say nobody's good.
[40:05.680 --> 40:07.440]  There could never be a recovery.
[40:07.440 --> 40:23.600]  They could fight globalism, look at this little jewel, Chelsea Clinton wrote a new book, Governing
[40:23.600 --> 40:24.600]  Global Health.
[40:24.600 --> 40:29.400]  Oh, how global government's going to be based on controlling your health and controlling
[40:29.400 --> 40:35.240]  big plagues that are going to happen and only a global government, a global cage, a global
[40:35.240 --> 40:38.880]  grid can keep you safe from the coming plagues.
[40:38.880 --> 40:40.840]  Ever watched my film in game?
[40:40.840 --> 40:45.640]  Came out in 2007, where I say they'll use global pandemics to bring in global government.
[40:45.640 --> 40:48.080]  Of course, I didn't just look at a crystal ball.
[40:48.080 --> 40:54.240]  I read the Banff Canada documents over 2,000 pages of them that came out when judicial
[40:54.240 --> 40:57.800]  watch sued and got the North American Union meeting documents.
[40:57.800 --> 41:00.880]  And boy, guess what was going on that meeting?
[41:00.880 --> 41:03.560]  Well, code next was going on.
[41:03.560 --> 41:07.160]  An agenda 21, and I'm going to tell you about that and tie it all together in a moment.
[41:07.160 --> 41:09.480]  But here are the headlines.
[41:09.480 --> 41:13.840]  Goldman Sachs's Trump rally has been curbed, Bloomberg.
[41:13.840 --> 41:17.680]  Goldman Sachs economists are starting to worry about President Trump.
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.120]  Yes, Bloomberg's putting all the bad news out now.
[41:23.120 --> 41:27.920]  Time to sell the dollar on erratic Trump policies, JP Morgan, they're all putting out
[41:27.920 --> 41:35.880]  the line, because you know what got leaked last week by good intelligence agencies was
[41:35.880 --> 41:43.800]  that George Soros is basically naked shorting the dollar and the pound to punish us to get
[41:43.800 --> 41:45.680]  us back under global government.
[41:45.680 --> 41:49.040]  And so of course, we can't have him go bankrupt.
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.440]  We've got to have JP Morgan and Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs all come out against America
[41:54.440 --> 42:00.840]  and England, they're doing that too, and all together naked short our currency and our
[42:00.840 --> 42:04.400]  stock market to destroy it.
[42:04.400 --> 42:05.400]  Thank you.
[42:05.400 --> 42:06.400]  Oh, yeah.
[42:06.400 --> 42:09.320]  Oh, because I forgot because Trump works for you, right?
[42:09.320 --> 42:10.320]  He's doing what you want.
[42:10.320 --> 42:11.560]  No, he's doing the opposite.
[42:11.560 --> 42:17.240]  And I'm almost convinced the average American doesn't even deserve Trump.
[42:17.240 --> 42:18.240]  I'm serious.
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.080]  They just want to fantasize how they're on the winning team and if the media says you're
[42:23.080 --> 42:27.040]  on the winning team by destroying Trump, well, God forbid he's trying to give you a life
[42:27.040 --> 42:30.640]  raft in the middle of the frozen Arctic Ocean.
[42:30.640 --> 42:33.400]  God forbid he gives you a space eater or some food.
[42:33.400 --> 42:37.560]  God forbid he actually not be out to get you because after all, you don't deserve that
[42:37.560 --> 42:42.360]  like the elites have told me because the public is a bunch of scum, Alex, and they're evil
[42:42.360 --> 42:44.120]  and they inherently want to be hurt.
[42:44.120 --> 42:46.880]  Alex, you'll never be in a bad position because you're smart.
[42:46.880 --> 42:47.880]  You're one of us.
[42:47.880 --> 42:49.160]  You'll learn, Alex.
[42:49.160 --> 42:51.160]  One day you'll come and work for us.
[42:51.160 --> 42:53.880]  One day, that's why we're going to let you live.
[42:53.880 --> 42:55.400]  Well, guess what?
[42:55.400 --> 42:58.480]  Trump doesn't want to be part of this either and I will never be part of screwing everyone
[42:58.480 --> 43:02.480]  over because let me tell you, a big percentage of people do care and they know the truth
[43:02.480 --> 43:04.480]  and they're as upset about this as I am.
[43:04.480 --> 43:06.280]  And together, we're going to beat you.
[43:06.280 --> 43:07.920]  You understand that?
[43:07.920 --> 43:11.800]  I don't care what you turn the public into or if 80% of them act like animals.
[43:11.800 --> 43:14.160]  I'm not lowering your level and feeding on them.
[43:14.160 --> 43:19.160]  I'm not a cannibal.
[43:19.160 --> 43:24.440]  Bloomberg sworn to break up your family, sworn to get your guns and admitted technocrat who
[43:24.440 --> 43:29.360]  brags in, in, in profiles that he wants to run every fast of your life and have you live
[43:29.360 --> 43:36.120]  in a 225 square foot coffin apartment with everything you do surveilled and no more families
[43:36.120 --> 43:39.160]  and total control.
[43:39.160 --> 43:40.920]  He is a monster.
[43:40.920 --> 43:44.440]  He says he wants to decide what you're going to eat.
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.560]  He calls himself the great technocrat.
[43:48.560 --> 43:53.600]  He made tens of billions of dollars extra just in the last few years because he's wired
[43:53.600 --> 43:58.200]  into all the high frequency trading and all the grids and all the smart meters and everything.
[43:58.200 --> 44:03.680]  He wrote the systems with the NSA that literally control you and gain you.
[44:03.680 --> 44:09.040]  And so if, if Microsoft wants a system to gain you or Amazon wants one or Alibaba, they
[44:09.040 --> 44:13.880]  got to go to him because he's given all the advanced technology as the little high priest.
[44:13.880 --> 44:17.080]  They decided to manage it to screw you over.
[44:17.080 --> 44:19.280]  Man, he makes me sick.
[44:19.280 --> 44:23.880]  And then he's got all the little trendies loving it because in all these publications
[44:23.880 --> 44:25.840]  and in little announcements, you won.
[44:25.840 --> 44:26.840]  You're a winner.
[44:26.840 --> 44:28.280]  You're part of the winning team.
[44:28.280 --> 44:30.240]  You live in downtown Austin.
[44:30.240 --> 44:31.600]  You're under the smart meters.
[44:31.600 --> 44:33.360]  Yeah, you don't have kids.
[44:33.360 --> 44:35.640]  Yeah, you don't have a yard.
[44:35.640 --> 44:40.640]  Yeah, we DNA test your dog's poop to make sure you're not letting your dog poop outside.
[44:40.640 --> 44:42.320]  But that's not a surveillance grid.
[44:42.320 --> 44:44.760]  That's not beyond big brother or brave new world.
[44:44.760 --> 44:45.760]  Yeah.
[44:45.760 --> 44:46.760]  Yeah.
[44:46.760 --> 44:56.920]  You're traveling to another dimension is called agenda 21.
[44:56.920 --> 45:02.760]  It's called code next, which is next code for the next download, your next directive
[45:02.760 --> 45:10.800]  in the Borg assimilation into a system where you're assimilated to be destroyed.
[45:10.800 --> 45:13.920]  The end of humanity openly announced the end of man.
[45:13.920 --> 45:18.320]  Why the future doesn't need us hundreds of books, thousands of white papers I read 20
[45:18.320 --> 45:19.320]  years ago.
[45:19.320 --> 45:20.320]  And now I'm watching it happen.
[45:20.320 --> 45:21.640]  I'm living it.
[45:21.640 --> 45:25.960]  And I go down and there's people with huge mustaches and a pink sock and a green sock
[45:25.960 --> 45:27.600]  dancing with potbellies.
[45:27.600 --> 45:29.760]  And they go, screw you, Alex, we don't care.
[45:29.760 --> 45:32.360]  And I'm like, it's a master plan to take you down.
[45:32.360 --> 45:35.000]  I think your mustache is cool, actually.
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.400]  I think your green and red sock is cool.
[45:37.400 --> 45:42.680]  But listen, you're not individual by being screwed over by this and by believing that
[45:42.680 --> 45:46.200]  this is how you're cool with smart mirrors, everything you do being tracked and all your
[45:46.200 --> 45:50.880]  friends run around and wave your arms and but everybody goes home alone at night because
[45:50.880 --> 45:51.880]  there is no family.
[45:51.880 --> 45:53.040]  None of it's real.
[45:53.040 --> 45:54.600]  You're living a simulation.
[45:54.600 --> 45:56.800]  You're living a fraud.
[45:56.800 --> 46:02.640]  If sports is a primitive form of virtual reality, it's real reality, but based on a controlled
[46:02.640 --> 46:07.880]  confine where the outcome won't affect the true power structure.
[46:07.880 --> 46:13.000]  And now they're extrapolating it out to VR and in total systems that remove you from
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  reality.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.600]  And I could see that myself by studying it, but then I go read their own white papers
[46:18.600 --> 46:23.360]  and they're giggling and laughing about it.
[46:23.360 --> 46:32.240]  While they're building armored fortresses in jungle mountain keeps from Tasmania to Kauai
[46:32.240 --> 46:39.420]  and not letting any electronics be there and their children being brought up like Amish
[46:39.420 --> 46:43.520]  because when they're done with this taken over, they know it's a weapon system.
[46:43.520 --> 46:47.400]  It's not some uplifting, great, beautiful thing they're entering into.
[46:47.400 --> 46:51.320]  And so Trump's like, we're not doing this.
[46:51.320 --> 46:55.160]  We're not going to make everybody pour a number of everybody down and turn off the lights
[46:55.160 --> 46:56.680]  and put people in coffins.
[46:56.680 --> 46:58.400]  What the hell is this?
[46:58.400 --> 47:00.000]  And they're like, oh, really?
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.200]  Watch us deep six everything.
[47:01.200 --> 47:02.880]  And he knows he's battling them.
[47:02.880 --> 47:05.440]  He knows he's racing to try to bring prosperity.
[47:05.440 --> 47:11.240]  But they're going to make it trendy to go, look, the economy's plunging leftist dump
[47:11.240 --> 47:19.080]  your stocks, show Trump that we'll live in failure together.
[47:19.080 --> 47:21.480]  Time to sell the dollar on erratic Trump policies.
[47:21.480 --> 47:23.760]  JP Morgan says, that's right, he's erratic.
[47:23.760 --> 47:24.760]  He's bad.
[47:24.760 --> 47:25.760]  He's evil.
[47:25.760 --> 47:26.760]  Stabilize the economy.
[47:26.760 --> 47:33.080]  So they say, crash the economy, and when they crash it, whose fault is it?
[47:33.080 --> 47:35.440]  It's Trump and all his supporters.
[47:35.440 --> 47:37.240]  Wow.
[47:37.240 --> 47:43.160]  And oh, the Republicans say, sorry, not going to let the poor and middle class have tax cuts.
[47:43.160 --> 47:53.520]  My name's Paul Ryan, and I have twinkly blue eyes, so it's OK.
[47:53.520 --> 47:58.760]  It feels good, doesn't it, screw people over.
[47:58.760 --> 48:00.720]  And then we've got all the other documents.
[48:00.720 --> 48:05.480]  Oh, we've got them all right here.
[48:05.480 --> 48:10.080]  How world leaders were duped into investing billions over manipulated global warming
[48:10.080 --> 48:11.080]  data.
[48:11.080 --> 48:15.760]  All the data coming out, all of it was fake, fake thermometers, fake readings, fake, fake,
[48:15.760 --> 48:17.080]  fake to bring in global government.
[48:17.080 --> 48:20.200]  The only thing that's not accurate in the Daily Mail of the Publications is they weren't
[48:20.200 --> 48:21.200]  duped.
[48:21.200 --> 48:22.440]  They were put in to do it.
[48:22.440 --> 48:29.720]  And yes, top engineers that were there witnessing it all are coming out.
[48:29.720 --> 48:35.920]  But see, since that got exposed six years ago, they've just moved on to call it change.
[48:35.920 --> 48:39.760]  If there's any change, you're going to have to give your change over that's in your pocket
[48:39.760 --> 48:42.440]  to them, except they're getting rid of change.
[48:42.440 --> 48:45.520]  Everything's digital under the governing global health.
[48:45.520 --> 48:47.400]  Who runs the world and why?
[48:47.400 --> 48:49.520]  Oh, there's no global governance.
[48:49.520 --> 49:01.600]  But Chelsea, when she's not sucking two billion out of Haiti, refugee money or relief money,
[49:01.600 --> 49:05.280]  she's telling you how there's going to be a global government and just how great it
[49:05.280 --> 49:06.800]  is to be part of it.
[49:06.800 --> 49:10.640]  And it's going to run health because big plagues are coming that are going to kill a lot of
[49:10.640 --> 49:15.520]  people and they're going to have to manage the whole thing and manage everybody dying
[49:15.520 --> 49:19.880]  and not let those pesky Christian missionaries and actually help folks and they need to stop
[49:19.880 --> 49:23.480]  them and then just, you know, take everything they've got.
[49:23.480 --> 49:26.160]  But don't worry, there's going to be lots of company because they're going to make you
[49:26.160 --> 49:31.200]  real poor too, so they can teach you because you wouldn't figure out how they were screwing
[49:31.200 --> 49:32.200]  you over.
[49:32.200 --> 49:39.600]  So now they're going to hurt you real bad and Chelsea wants more.
[49:39.600 --> 49:40.600]  We come back.
[49:40.600 --> 49:49.520]  There's a couple of clips that document this extremely, extremely powerful and I'm also
[49:49.520 --> 49:58.760]  going to tie this in to why Nancy Pelosi, you know, comes out and says, who's got dirt
[49:58.760 --> 50:01.800]  on Trump?
[50:01.800 --> 50:06.520]  What does Putin have on him that, you know, that makes him go this course?
[50:06.520 --> 50:11.520]  Well, Pelosi, for one, it's because Russia isn't doing anything to the U.S.
[50:11.520 --> 50:13.200]  Russia isn't expanding.
[50:13.200 --> 50:17.840]  But more importantly, he's been advised by patriots in the government on another course
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.920]  out of this, pulling Europe out of the global system, pulling the U.K. out.
[50:21.920 --> 50:23.440]  That's already started to happen.
[50:23.440 --> 50:24.440]  Russia's already pulled out.
[50:24.440 --> 50:26.520]  Japan doesn't want to be part of it once out now.
[50:26.520 --> 50:30.360]  They were induced after they were conquered by the U.S. be part of it.
[50:30.360 --> 50:32.040]  China says it wants to be the new dominant force.
[50:32.040 --> 50:36.120]  So there's a huge shift happening as we reach the critical crossroads.
[50:36.120 --> 50:37.680]  Japan wants to pull out.
[50:37.680 --> 50:39.600]  She's in the lead as well.
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.560]  She says we're at the crossroads for the end of the West or not, the end of freedom.
[50:43.560 --> 50:47.920]  And so at this great point, when they're finally about to kill all freedom and prosperity,
[50:47.920 --> 50:50.520]  some people are kind of hesitating for a moment.
[50:50.520 --> 50:56.360]  Guys, are you tired of being tired, frustrated because it seems impossible to lose belly
[50:56.360 --> 50:57.360]  fat?
[50:57.360 --> 50:59.840]  If you're looking for a solution, then listen to Mark.
[50:59.840 --> 51:06.960]  I had fantastic results with the Andro 400 Max, probably lost 35 pounds, and more impressive
[51:06.960 --> 51:12.760]  than that was the inches I lost off of my belly and my waist, and the increased energy
[51:12.760 --> 51:13.760]  is fantastic.
[51:13.760 --> 51:19.200]  I'll be totally honest, I tried a different product, and I wasn't happy with the different
[51:19.200 --> 51:20.200]  product.
[51:20.200 --> 51:25.680]  You guys are considerably cheaper than the other brand, and I can really feel the difference.

[52:20.280 --> 52:22.960]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's your problem with it.
[52:22.960 --> 52:27.120]  The active ingredient in turmeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells

[53:34.680 --> 53:38.640]  Attention Patrons, tired of the tyranny and crime in the sanctuary cities?
[53:38.640 --> 53:41.400]  Leave the city and seek refuge in the American Redoubt.
[53:41.400 --> 53:42.920]  Leave the city.com.
[53:42.920 --> 53:45.880]  Move to the freedom of Idaho, Montana, or Wyoming.
[53:45.880 --> 53:47.440]  Leave the city.com.
[53:47.440 --> 53:49.760]  Leave the city.com.
[53:49.760 --> 54:16.800]  So much going on, so much going on, so much going on, so many things going on in the
[54:16.800 --> 54:17.800]  world.
[54:17.800 --> 54:28.520]  So the globalists admit that they have absolutely destabilized the third world, put in policies
[54:28.520 --> 54:29.840]  to balloon populations.
[54:29.840 --> 54:34.560]  Now they're going to weaponize politically those groups, bring them in, put them in,
[54:34.560 --> 54:41.480]  government sponsored 220 to 250 square foot apartments, drive down wages, politically
[54:41.480 --> 54:45.560]  brainwash them, and then use them as a tool of political control.
[54:45.560 --> 54:49.520]  And then once you're driven down to those wage levels, you will have to accept the coffin
[54:49.520 --> 54:54.400]  cities, the coffin buildings, and all the social engineering that comes with those.
[54:54.400 --> 54:58.000]  But don't worry, if you're upper middle class, you might get a thousand square foot apartment
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.560]  for you and your two or three kids, but there's going to be penalties for it, and you're going
[55:01.560 --> 55:05.760]  to have weekly inspections by the building manager to make sure that you're going under
[55:05.760 --> 55:10.000]  all the social controls, and of course you've got to have all your vaccines, and you've
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.640]  got to be DNA tested and all the rest of it to make sure you're behaving yourself.
[55:14.640 --> 55:15.640]  This is the model.
[55:15.640 --> 55:20.680]  Meanwhile, Trump is battling to stop the global financial collapse that the New World Order
[55:20.680 --> 55:23.080]  has been engineering for a very, very long time.
[55:23.080 --> 55:28.620]  He's trying to bring back old fashioned prosperity and making alliances with the UK and with
[55:28.620 --> 55:31.200]  Le Pen of France and so many others.
[55:31.200 --> 55:33.160]  And so what are the globalists doing?
[55:33.160 --> 55:37.360]  I mean, Trump is racing to fight the Bloomberg plan.
[55:37.360 --> 55:42.400]  This is a Bloomberg plan, a Bloomberg push, as the very plan I just mentioned.
[55:42.400 --> 55:46.640]  He's trying to make deals with Australia, Russia, anybody that will talk to him.
[55:46.640 --> 55:50.200]  And so when he talks to Russia, he started pulling out of globalism about 18 years ago.
[55:50.200 --> 55:51.840]  They go, you're a Russian agent.
[55:51.840 --> 55:53.160]  You don't want war with them.
[55:53.160 --> 55:56.680]  You don't like George Soros overthrowing Ukraine starting a civil war?
[55:56.680 --> 55:58.240]  You don't want to have a war.
[55:58.240 --> 56:01.840]  Our own general starting four years ago began to work with the Russians to block ISIS and
[56:01.840 --> 56:02.840]  Al-Qaeda.
[56:02.840 --> 56:06.640]  There was a soft coup against Obama saying, we're not going to spread the Arab Spring
[56:06.640 --> 56:11.120]  all over Africa and Europe and the Middle East and do this.
[56:11.120 --> 56:12.960]  And so who was the main architect of that?
[56:12.960 --> 56:14.480]  Well, it was General Dempsey at the time.
[56:14.480 --> 56:18.560]  It was chairman of the Joint Chiefs, but it was also General Flynn that ran it.
[56:18.560 --> 56:19.560]  And that's now come out.
[56:19.560 --> 56:25.000]  I told you about it first four years ago with Colonel Schaefer, CIA whistleblowers, you name
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  it.
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.440]  And I was whistleblowing to give General Flynn and others the cover they needed politically
[56:30.440 --> 56:31.440]  to do it.
[56:31.440 --> 56:38.920]  Then you saw senators come out, like his credit Paul and of course, Cruz and say we're not
[56:38.920 --> 56:40.480]  Al-Qaeda's Air Force.
[56:40.480 --> 56:42.960]  So they changed the name to ISIS to confuse you.
[56:42.960 --> 56:49.040]  And so Trump's being advised by even folks like Mattis that used to be anti-Russian
[56:49.040 --> 56:55.880]  to this is an alliance if we can do it with Japan, with Russia, with countries breaking
[56:55.880 --> 57:02.800]  away in Europe, with the UK, with Australia, against China and the New World Order.
[57:02.800 --> 57:06.760]  Because the U.S. is to be brought down, folks, and China be set up as number one, and a lot
[57:06.760 --> 57:11.440]  of our military intelligence agencies aren't wimps, the vectors some of the meanest, most
[57:11.440 --> 57:14.680]  murderous people you can imagine.
[57:14.680 --> 57:16.320]  That's why America was number one.
[57:16.320 --> 57:17.920]  And we had the moral high ground.
[57:17.920 --> 57:20.000]  They've been told it's bye-bye time.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.920]  The lights are going off in America basically politically.
[57:22.920 --> 57:24.840]  They said the hell they are.
[57:24.840 --> 57:28.480]  And so Pelosi asked what do the Russians have on Trump?
[57:28.480 --> 57:30.840]  What do they have on Trump?
[57:30.840 --> 57:32.560]  They have nothing on Trump.
[57:32.560 --> 57:35.520]  Trump is being advised to make an alliance with Russia because they're not a threat
[57:35.520 --> 57:39.600]  to the United States, and if we get them as an ally, it's a checkmate against the globalist
[57:39.600 --> 57:40.600]  and the Chinese.
[57:40.600 --> 57:44.600]  And I'm not against the Chinese people either, but the horrible communists that run it.
[57:44.600 --> 57:45.600]  Here's Nancy Pelosi.
[57:45.600 --> 57:51.640]  But let me just go back to the first part of the senator's statement.
[57:51.640 --> 57:55.360]  I want to know what the Russians have on Donald Trump.
[57:55.360 --> 58:00.160]  I think we have to have that investigation by the FBI into his financial, personal, and
[58:00.160 --> 58:06.960]  political connections to Russia, and we want to see his tax returns so we can have truth
[58:06.960 --> 58:10.000]  in the relationship between Putin, whom he admires.
[58:10.000 --> 58:15.440]  But I want to go back to the issue of Democrats having lost touch.
[58:15.440 --> 58:16.440]  Democrats having lost touch.
[58:16.440 --> 58:17.960]  How do we con people again?
[58:17.960 --> 58:20.560]  Let's claim we're reinvented.
[58:20.560 --> 58:21.560]  So there you go.
[58:21.560 --> 58:23.840]  The Clintons wouldn't release their foundation info.
[58:23.840 --> 58:25.560]  Trump should not release his tax returns either.
[58:25.560 --> 58:27.040]  I'm sick of all this crap.
[58:27.040 --> 58:31.080]  I'm tired of having to, like, publish all the handgun owners in cities on the Internet
[58:31.080 --> 58:32.680]  so they can get robbed or harassed.
[58:32.680 --> 58:33.680]  You scumbags.
[58:33.680 --> 58:34.760]  We see you.
[58:34.760 --> 58:36.760]  We're going to beat you.
[58:36.760 --> 58:37.760]  Thank God for Trump.
[58:37.760 --> 58:41.320]  They're trying to cause a worldwide depression right now.
[58:41.320 --> 58:45.160]  Despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works, here's five reasons why it won't.
[58:45.160 --> 58:48.840]  Number one, California has many of the most restrictive gun laws in the country.
[58:48.840 --> 58:52.640]  Yet those laws did absolutely nothing to stop the San Bernardino shooting.
[58:52.640 --> 58:56.160]  Number two, Paris, France also has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world.
[58:56.160 --> 58:59.920]  But those laws also did nothing to stop the November 13th ISIS attacks.
[58:59.920 --> 59:04.520]  Number three, it's estimated that someone in Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite
[59:04.520 --> 59:06.520]  the city's strict gun laws.
[59:06.520 --> 59:10.360]  Number four, Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like Chicago.
[59:10.360 --> 59:15.080]  Yet over 160,000 people have been murdered in the country's drug war since 2007.
[59:15.080 --> 59:18.760]  The only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels are private citizens who
[59:18.760 --> 59:23.080]  are openly defying Mexico's gun laws to form self-defense militias.
[59:23.080 --> 59:27.080]  Number five, President Obama has been arming and funding ISIS-linked Syrian rebels for
[59:27.080 --> 59:28.080]  quite some time.
[59:28.080 --> 59:32.840]  In fact, Obama reproved the rearming of the so-called moderate rebels on October 1st.
[59:32.840 --> 59:36.400]  The same day he called for gun control in response to the community college shooting
[59:36.400 --> 59:37.400]  up in Oregon.
[59:37.400 --> 59:43.280]  You can find out more at infowarst.com's Kit Daniels reporting.
[59:43.280 --> 59:54.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:54.280 --> 1:00:17.280]  Look at Drudge Report today and the theme that's emerging.
[1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:18.280]  Automation.
[1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:23.320]  Amazon plans store which employs only two humans.
[1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:27.040]  That robot runs supermarket.
[1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:29.680]  You see that and it goes on and on and on.
[1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:34.160]  They're building a world where we're obsolete and the elites are saying that's the case
[1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:41.880]  and then hurting us into these compact cities and then our only new job will be social engineering
[1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:48.120]  and complying with social directives.
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:54.920]  Not only establishes again the kind of ghost dance cult for the full collapse of the species.
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:01:00.720]  This is a social engineering, scientific, cultural takedown program beyond any alien
[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:08.400]  invasion science fiction movie you've ever read or seen, but it's not aliens doing it.
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:13.800]  It's guilds of psychopaths that have decided we're overpopulated, that humans don't deserve
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:19.640]  to go into the future, that we don't matter and so we need to be killed and we're led
[1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:25.360]  by scum who should go first like Nancy Pelosi.
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:30.440]  Look at Chelsea Clinton being part of stealing billions of dollars from Haitians, all of
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:35.680]  her parents' crimes and then she puts out a book guaranteed this lazy fop didn't write
[1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:36.680]  it.
[1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:37.680]  Governing global health.
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:39.960]  Who runs the world and why?
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:44.280]  They say, oh, global governments really health crises and the global groups will respond
[1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:45.280]  to health crises.
[1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:51.160]  Yes, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation openly through the vaccines giving people all sorts
[1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:52.160]  of different diseases.
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:53.640]  They've been caught doing it.
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:02:04.840]  It's been in the major news, but it's so nightmarish and so big it's like they're too big to fail.
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:06.440]  And our fall is their rise.
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:10.480]  They need us to fall for them to rise.
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:17.480]  Now we have Milo Yiannopoulos, the dangerous faggot as he calls himself, joining us here
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:21.000]  for like 10 minutes to the next segment.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.440]  His book is even out till March 15th and it's already number one on Amazon.
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:29.280]  We'll guarantee you go to number one on The New York Times.
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:35.720]  And this is all because they continue to try to censor him when he simply asks why is the
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.880]  left so anti-free speech?
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:40.280]  Because the left is the operating system of the globalists.
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:41.880]  It isn't left or right.
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:43.160]  It's the operating system.
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:48.000]  The Republicans and the Tories in England are just the loyal opposition.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.720]  And they want to end free speech and bring in an authoritarian system.
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:52.720]  That's their admission.
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:56.320]  So it's not like they're misguided beating people up and attacking people who try to
[1:02:56.320 --> 1:03:01.040]  attend a speech, including members of the press that go, hey, I'm liberal, shut up, white
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:07.000]  male, boom, punch him in the nose, it's that that's what they're normalizing.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  That they're wonderful heroes when they beat up a woman, when 25 guys do, but when you
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:17.200]  just have speech and say we have a right to not be under Obamacare, well, you're a racist
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:23.160]  who hates our first black president.
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:26.960]  I haven't even gotten to all this yet today, but after he leaves us, Super Bowl viewers
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:31.040]  see correlation between outcome and election, I love it.
[1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:35.200]  They created all these sports that are really for children to get men to be an arrested
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:37.880]  development, never make anything of themselves in life.
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:40.960]  It's also an alternate career that doesn't threaten the elite.
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:45.920]  Oh, no, we don't want some of the most dominant aggressive men in politics or life, or even
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:47.000]  the military.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:53.040]  We want you to go to college so you can hope to be in one of these myriad sports teams,
[1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:57.520]  you know, it's like one out of 10,000, you'll ever make a living at it, show that by the
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:05.120]  time you figure out you've had your life destroyed, all you can do is be a coach at age 30.
[1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:09.840]  And by the way, the modern guy in France that created the new Olympics wrote books admitting
[1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:14.240]  all this as a way to control the public and Hitler picked up on it as well and did the
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:15.840]  first big Olympics in 36.
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:16.840]  This is not my opinion.
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:20.320]  A lot of folks are addicted to video games or sports go, shut up, Alex.
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:25.840]  I'm like, hey, listen, I'm just telling you, you know, it's meant to take your life home.
[1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:26.840]  Okay.
[1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:31.560]  And I get the rich and powerful use it to, you know, hijack fame and control and I kind
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:34.960]  of like the Patriots winning because, you know, they're called the Patriots and Trump's
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:37.880]  called them every year right and is just part of the winning streak.
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:41.360]  And we better bet on Trump's winning streak because they're openly trying to plunge the
[1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:42.480]  global economy right now.
[1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:43.920]  I'm going to get more into that as well.
[1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:51.560]  Coming up, stay with us.
[1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:56.440]  President Donald Trump says negative polls are usually fake news.
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:01.280]  The president took to Twitter this morning to slam media coverage that cites negative
[1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:02.280]  polls.
[1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:08.440]  This, after CNN released one yesterday that claimed the majority of Americans oppose President
[1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:14.440]  Trump's executive order to temporarily ban refugees from failed state countries with
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:16.320]  ties to terrorism.
[1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:22.480]  Trump said on Twitter, any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN ABC NBC polls
[1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:23.480]  in the election.
[1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:27.240]  Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.
[1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:32.320]  Another poll, this time by CBS claims that more than half of Americans disagree with
[1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:34.360]  Trump's travel restriction order.
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:39.760]  However, two polls released last week by Reuters and Rasmussen, not reported by the mainstream
[1:05:39.760 --> 1:05:42.000]  media, found the opposite.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:47.040]  Those polls suggest that the majority of Americans strongly support Trump's order.

[1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:40.240]  Thanks Alex Jones
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:45.000]  Milo. He's their tech editor. Nobody needs to be introduced to Milo. He's one of the
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:50.940]  biggest media icons out there now. Not just because they've protested, even tried to block
[1:08:50.940 --> 1:08:56.800]  his free speech, but he's also an articulate guy. And his book, Dangerous, is already number
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:03.960]  one on Amazon a month before it even comes out. Amazing. So the countdown for that is
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:08.520]  happening. We'll talk more about the book on Wednesday. And Milo and I are also planning
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:12.720]  something on the street in the next few weeks. That's exciting. We won't tell you about that
[1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:18.520]  until right before because of obviously the enemies that are out there. But Milo, congratulations.
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:23.120]  Really pointing out how the First Amendment is really under attack.
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:27.200]  Well, thank you so much. Thank you for having me. How are you, darling? Yeah, I love your
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:30.200]  introduction music, by the way. It's all very dramatic. It feels like we're in an episode
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:36.640]  of 300 or something. It's wonderful. No, I've been having so much fun on the college tour
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:42.520]  right up until, I guess, the West Coast. And then UC Davis, UW, Seattle, UC Berkeley,
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:48.880]  things went dark. And we had the paid, black-clothed anarchists, these well-organized, well-funded
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:56.520]  anarchists coming in and causing mayhem. And the progressive left refuses to disavow.
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:10:00.200]  It refuses to say, this is terrible, that people should be allowed to express their views no
[1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:06.480]  matter what their views are. It's absolutely terrible for the left. Bring themselves to
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:10.680]  hold to basic principles. You know, hold fair. I hate what you say, but I'll defend it. You're
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:15.400]  right to say whatever. This shows the left that they're most sinister and authoritarian.
[1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:19.760]  And that's why my book, as you say, and thanks for bringing it up, is shot to number one
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:24.040]  at the top of the Amazon bestseller list. And interestingly, the three books at the
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:29.600]  top of the Amazon bestseller list this morning are The Handmaid's Tale, 1984, and Me. And
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:33.600]  I think it gives you some indication of how America is feeling about the ruling elite.
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:39.740]  Absolutely. And now LePen is way ahead in the polls. The Brexit's happened. We've got
[1:10:39.740 --> 1:10:45.160]  Italy saying no to EU expansion. This is amazing. I mean, I think we've reached a major tipping
[1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:50.440]  point. And no matter what George Soros or Nancy Pelosi do, Milo, I don't see them reversing
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:51.440]  it.
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:58.960]  No, neither do I. I mean, this becomes a point, you know, beyond which myths enter people
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:03.160]  through the media and all the other various bits of the rigged system that were pointed
[1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:09.880]  in Hillary's favor in the last election just don't work against the colossal volume of
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:15.440]  people who are just sick of being lied to and lied about, sick of having their lives
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:20.680]  ruled over, sick of being ruled over by people who think that they know how we should speak
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:24.960]  and what we should read and what we should know, how we should express ourselves. People
[1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:30.320]  are tired of this now. They're tired of policies that benefit global elites and don't benefit
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:37.760]  regular people and they're voting accordingly. And all of the rigging and vote whatever and
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:44.000]  fake news and all the rest of it, it can't really fight this globalist, sorry, this global
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.640]  nationalist populist uprising. It's very exciting to watch for those of us, you know, like
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:52.000]  you and I, who share so many sympathies with people who are voting out of frustration with
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  the elite.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.480]  Certainly. And then even when Trump comes out and says, I like the Patriots, been friends
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:03.480]  with the quarterback and the coach and the owner for years, they make it then about white
[1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:08.480]  supremacism, even though it's black players, you know, I mean, won the game along with
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:13.640]  it. It's just crazy. It just shows how they project their race obsession on everything.
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:17.840]  That's exactly what happened. These people are obsessed with interpreting the world through
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:22.800]  the prism of skin color, sexuality and gender. And they assume everybody else does it like
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:23.800]  they do.
[1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:27.720]  Which is why, you know, the rest of us, and I mean the rest of us, because the social
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:33.240]  justice contingent, Hollywood media, you know, the entertainment industry, the academia
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:38.960]  and a couple of bozos on Twitter have been exposed as the minority. And for a long time,
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:42.120]  you know, we were thinking, God, is it just us? You know, the people sort of sitting at
[1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:47.080]  home alone and in their bedrooms reading the internet thinking, my God, am I insane? But
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:52.280]  no, you're not insane. Most people actually think more like you than they think like them.
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:56.160]  And all of America is just sitting back and laughing at the progressive left trying to
[1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:58.720]  turn this into a race thing. It's pathetic.
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:03.560]  Exactly. I want to play just a short compilation of women being attacked at your event last
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:10.040]  week at Berkeley in San Francisco and other events and then CNN reporters laughing saying,
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:14.400]  oh, poor white people. And then of course we have the woman running for the DNC chair
[1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:18.280]  saying, I'm white, but my job is to make sure whites don't get privileged and that you get
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:23.280]  privileged. This is like the KKK. Let's let's play this clip. Here it is, Milo.
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:33.680]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please almost stop.
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:38.360]  So this is only getting worse and worse. You were there. You had to be taken out. You had
[1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:43.680]  a bulletproof vest on. They're saying kill you. And then CNN played a clip of them throwing
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:48.760]  firebombs at you. And then they said Milo's a flamethrower while they said that implying
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:50.160]  it was you doing it.
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:54.440]  Of course. And you know, the other thing that CNN did, Don Lemon had on Robert Wright,
[1:13:54.440 --> 1:14:00.160]  who was in the Clinton administration, who alleged on the basis of no evidence, most
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:03.800]  appalling and outrageous thing I think I've ever heard. And this is a moment when a lot
[1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:08.920]  of my fans, I mean, you know, I haven't been on the scene for as long as you Alex, but
[1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:13.760]  I'm starting to, you know, to master a decent amount of support in America. And I have now
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:18.120]  have a reasonable number of people who like me who follow what I do. And it was just this
[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:22.280]  moment of slack toward horror when people finally realized that everything that we've
[1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:24.320]  been saying about the media is true.
[1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:29.240]  When on CNN, Robert Wright, who used to be in the Clinton administration, who's now a
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:35.200]  professor at UC Berkeley said, I wouldn't be surprised if Milo hired those guys himself
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:42.400]  alleging that Breitbart had paid for 150 armed organized anarchist protesters to beat up our
[1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:43.400]  own audience.
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:44.400]  And then he went further.
[1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:47.840]  That's what he suggested. And Don Lemon didn't call them out on it. Don Lemon asked him
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:52.640]  to expand on it. And then the guy, Robert Wright, writes it again, saying I wouldn't
[1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:58.640]  bet against it in Newsweek. This is CNN and Newsweek pushing like, you know, insane, literally
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:02.240]  insane conspiracy theories. It's amazing.
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:07.880]  It is. And he went on to say basically that it was Wright Wingers that rioted when I was
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:14.160]  there in DC for the inauguration. I mean, I couldn't even get to the deplorable because
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:19.400]  it was so out of control and trying to beat and attack and throw feces at people. And then
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:23.240]  meanwhile, I know you were attacked as well and had trouble even being there. Then meanwhile,
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:27.040]  it took me hours to get into the entrances to the inauguration because they were attacking
[1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:33.120]  men, women and children while they screamed, no violence, no violence. Why are you violent?
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:37.800]  So is there a method of their madness? We know they're being directed by the big foundations,
[1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:39.680]  by Soros Milo.
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:45.960]  Well, you know, we're trying to find out as much as we can for sure about this. One thing
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:50.120]  that is certain is that these people, it's the same people. They keep popping up. They're
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:54.120]  very well funded and well organized. And they appear any time someone like you or me or
[1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:58.760]  Trump is trying to give a public speech or an event.
[1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:03.120]  Now the thing to say, the thing I actually find more worrying is that the police, particularly
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:08.680]  on campus, are adopting a position now of not engaging them. Their position is it's
[1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:12.400]  better for a few people to get beaten up. And who knows, sooner or later, somebody might
[1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:16.640]  get killed. And it's better for a few windows and a few ATMs to get smashed than for them
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:21.120]  to go in and for there to be police on protester violence. But we should be calling this stuff,
[1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:28.000]  what it is, it's domestic terrorism. It is a textbook dictionary definition of domestic
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:31.760]  terrorism and we should be honest about what this stuff is and we should be policing it
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:32.760]  properly.
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:37.440]  And, you know, as I said on Judge Janine, on Fox the other day, Donald Trump needs to
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:42.320]  immediately withdraw federal funding from colleges like UC Berkeley that refuse to defend
[1:16:42.320 --> 1:16:43.320]  the president.
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:48.160]  Absolutely. If a university wouldn't let gay activists have an event or black activists
[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:54.760]  or Jewish activists or whoever have an event or anybody, you know, a ornithologist convention,
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:58.000]  if you're not letting free speech happen and students have their own events, then that
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:01.720]  place should have its funding pulled, just like some of the southern universities had
[1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:04.840]  theirs pulled. And in closing, in the last three or four minutes we have left the U.
[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:10.960]  Milo will expand on Wednesday. We're coming back for a full hour. This is just crazy because
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:15.120]  the police are being ordered to stand down, just like we learned in other cities that
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:19.720]  the Obama Justice Administration was ordering stand downs. They ordered it in D.C. for the
[1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:24.800]  inauguration so they could attack people. This is really their bullying tactic. And
[1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:28.920]  then they call you and I and Trump bullies. I'd like you to respond to that. And then
[1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:33.440]  the courage you have, how you decided to have the courage over and over again when you're
[1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:38.040]  getting death threats, you say you're going back to Berkeley. Tell us about that.
[1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:41.320]  Of course I am because these people don't scare me and they shouldn't be allowed. They
[1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:46.960]  should. A hundred idiots, whether they have bottled knives, Molotov cocktails or whatever,
[1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:50.240]  shouldn't be any match for the First Amendment. So screw them. So yes, I'm going back to
[1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:53.960]  Berkeley for sure sometime in the next, I hope two months. We're going to do a big
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:58.160]  march. I'm going to invite all my friends down. I want the message to be, if you get
[1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:02.840]  an event canceled by a conservative or a libertarian or a free thinking speaker, not only will
[1:18:02.840 --> 1:18:06.560]  we come back, but we'll bring our friends. And we'll just be there for the following
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:11.300]  year. We'll bring our friends. We'll bring our security. We'll bring our audiences. And
[1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:17.920]  we will have free speech, free thinking events on your campus every month for a year. And
[1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:23.560]  we will convert so many more students over to Donald Trump and to libertarianism and
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:29.520]  to Republicanism and to whatever bit of the ecosystem they hate. We will convert so many
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:34.560]  more people as a result of your attempt to shut down our speech. You will wish you had
[1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:37.720]  never left the house that day. That's absolutely what we're going to be doing.
[1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:41.800]  Well, I'm saying now, I'm going to join you for the First Amendment when you go back and
[1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:47.360]  I want to tell my listeners who are millions across the country and millions of California
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:51.760]  to be there peacefully. And I suspect these cowards aren't going to show up. They want
[1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:56.320]  to show up at your events with, you know, no announcement and attack a bunch of people
[1:18:56.320 --> 1:19:00.400]  and try to get away with it. But I think the sleeping giants awakening. Last question. Why
[1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:07.480]  do you think they're so politically blind to the fact that what they're doing is turning
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:12.080]  the world against them? And why do you think the elites continue to fund an attempt at
[1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:14.920]  civil war cop killing? You name it.
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:19.840]  Well, I think it's arrogance. I think it's complacency. For 30 years, the left has run
[1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:24.480]  academia. It's a run the entertainment industry and it's run the media unopposed and, you
[1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:28.240]  know, and unchallenged. And it's been able to lay down the law about what you can say,
[1:19:28.240 --> 1:19:32.480]  what you can read, how you can dress, you know, political correctness, language code,
[1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:35.960]  speech policing have become embedded in the last decade because the left basically hasn't
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:40.080]  had a credible or effective opposition in the form of, you know, a strong Republican
[1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:45.240]  candidate or cultural figures. Like I think you and I are actually, um, that it can actually
[1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:48.760]  present a robust challenge to them with the effect that they've been able to do things
[1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:52.600]  like distorting language, you know, calling for book burnings while calling the other
[1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:55.880]  side fascist. I mean, this stuff is preposterous and hypocritical.
[1:19:55.880 --> 1:19:59.520]  And by the way, in closing, because I'm gonna come back Wednesday, that's it. That's happened
[1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:05.000]  to you banned off Twitter, banned off all these other platforms for just saying ghostbusters
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:09.560]  is a big joke. And it was a big failure. You know, for making them fat jokes, the standard
[1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:14.040]  now in America is you make a fat joke about the wrong person and you lose your platform.
[1:20:14.040 --> 1:20:18.080]  Well, America has responded to that and America has replied to the progressive left replied
[1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:21.880]  to Silicon Valley replied to the media, um, and voted with their wallets and put my book
[1:20:21.880 --> 1:20:25.000]  at number one called dangerous. And you can go find it on Amazon. That's right.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:29.480]  You're not police. You're not police.net. Dangerous is the book. Well, I let's talk about this
[1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:33.640]  on Wednesday, but talk about your vision to defeat them into the future and where you
[1:20:33.640 --> 1:20:37.720]  think these culture wars are going. Milo, thank you so much for your defense. The first
[1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:46.720]  amendment can't wait, buddy. You bet. You bet. Well, I mean, I met him, uh, up in, um,
[1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:50.280]  Cleveland and he was kind of nervous when he first came on the show for like an hour
[1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:54.240]  and then we went over and, uh, with the crew and had some drinks with him over at the Ritz
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:21:01.080]  Carlton and, uh, you know, then got to know him and then he kind of warmed up and then
[1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:05.440]  I learned the guy really is a patriot. I mean, I never criticized him. I just have totally
[1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:09.560]  supported the first amendment. And I think the way the media works is they always make
[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:14.040]  stuff up to create infighting and I guess it said some stuff to Milo or whatever about
[1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:18.480]  me that wasn't true, uh, but it's good to know him now and good to see him exploding.
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:21.320]  I mean, I, I mean, I think it's very, very exciting. See, I don't see this as competition
[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:26.040]  that, oh, Milo's this giant meteoric rise and is reaching all these young people. I love
[1:21:26.040 --> 1:21:31.800]  it. I don't look at Paul Watson that works for me, uh, for 16 years becoming in some
[1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:40.120]  respects as big as I am. I hope he gets five times bigger. But I've even told Paul if you
[1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:43.720]  ever figure out a platform or a system more effective than this one, I'm going to give
[1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:48.440]  you my full support. Even if you leave him for worse and he's like, Oh no, I'm not leaving
[1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:51.760]  them for worse. You know, I love you Alex. You're doing a great job. Just give me the
[1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:55.840]  autonomy to do what I want to do my way. And I'm like, absolutely. But that's what
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:22:02.000]  real leadership is, is building new systems, founding new cities, launching new ships,
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:07.640]  launching new personalities, launching new movements. That's what I care about. I sincerely
[1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:14.680]  want to turn the tide so bad against globalism that I have to get people to restrain themselves,
[1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:19.520]  not to turn into authoritarians to route out the globalist. Those of them committed crimes
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:24.280]  must be prosecuted, but I don't want to become them when we're, you know, basically cleaning
[1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:29.960]  them up. I want to do it very judiciously by the book, by common law, by the constitution,
[1:22:29.960 --> 1:22:33.960]  but I'm not going to take pleasure in it. And some obviously will have to be executed.
[1:22:33.960 --> 1:22:37.760]  I mean, pedophiles and people and, you know, devil worshipers and you're going to have
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:41.960]  to die. You've been killing kids and finding a bunch of dead bodies, you know, you're going
[1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:45.360]  to get a jury trial and you're going to not going to be on death row for 20 years, bro.
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:48.960]  You're going to be dead in about a year. So just get ready. We're going to kill you.
[1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:52.760]  So just be prepared. And I don't say that that tough. It's just, I need to be honest
[1:22:52.760 --> 1:22:56.040]  with people what we're dealing with here. You kill kids. We're coming for you. And I
[1:22:56.040 --> 1:23:01.920]  know you've been doing it and God hears their, here's their screams. And you know what? God
[1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:05.720]  is ascending vengeance. So just get ready. And, and by the way, I'm not the one that's
[1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:17.080]  going to deliver the vengeance. I'm just ringing the drum and the war drum. I'm just ceremonially
[1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:21.960]  up here banging the drum and you see the armies and the fires at night as the camps
[1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:32.640]  build and as people shift gears into reality and as the army forms. But yes, those of you
[1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:38.880]  that have done horrible things, war crimes, you name it, those of you that organize giant
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:44.600]  frauds to defraud the public and steal trillions and, you know, establish planetary regimes
[1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:49.240]  at the expense of humanity. Those of you that have spliced humans with animals and engaged
[1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:55.600]  in incredible abominations, you must be made examples of so that others fear ever doing
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:24:00.880]  what you've done. I'll put you this way. If you don't fear God, we're going to make you
[1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:12.320]  fear man. That's how God works. And of course, then they will fear God. I'm going to try
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:17.840]  to really focus and come back and just briefly recap as strong as I can to get some other
[1:24:17.840 --> 1:24:21.560]  news I haven't hit concerning the fact you're trying to blow our political engine right
[1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:27.640]  now and that means blow our financial engine. If anybody ever had a question about Trump
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:33.760]  because he appointed some high powered bankers to the administration, look at what he's done.
[1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:38.680]  It's anti Goldman Sachs, anti-New World Order. You judge a tree by its fruits. It's like
[1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:44.160]  you go into some old, you know, dive place and it says they've got the best chili or
[1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:47.840]  whatever and you eat it and it tastes like mother's milk. You know why there's a line
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:51.400]  out the door. You see some big fancy place that nobody's going in. You just don't go
[1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:56.560]  in there because nobody's in there eating the food. You judge a tree by its fruits.
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:01.440]  You see a bunch of monkeys in a big fruit tree eating the fruit. You see another tree
[1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:04.720]  and you don't know what kind of fruit it is. Let's say you crash your airplane in, you
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:09.760]  know, Burma and they'll tell you in any survival book if you don't know the flora, you know,
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:16.560]  in your area, the flora and fauna, you watch what the animals are doing. You see a big
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:22.200]  old tree looks like it's got big, juicy fruit in it, but the monkeys aren't eating it.
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:26.960]  But you see monkeys in a bush eating some other little fruit. Well, what does that mean?
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:33.680]  It means you can eat that fruit. Well, man, Trump's got the most delicious, juicy fruit
[1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:40.120]  I've ever seen. It's so good. It kind of makes me think, whoa, this is almost too good to
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:44.880]  be true. But then I see the enemy saying kill him and get in the way with it, calling for
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:52.440]  civil war, trying to block his tax cuts, trying to raise interest rates and Bloomberg, AP,
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:58.520]  Reuters, CNBC, every financial outfit saying crash, crash, market crash, crash the dollar,
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:03.080]  crash the dollar. With George Soros hopping up and down like a demon with a pitchfork
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:09.560]  up on the roof, leading the whole conductor, the whole symphony. And it's like, man, folks,
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:16.960]  if you don't stand up for Trump, you're an idiot. It's ridiculous. And he's got luck
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:22.120]  on his side. He's got Providence. I think the Patriots probably won because he said they
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:26.600]  would. I'm serious. That's how Providence works. With George Washington, it got so bad
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:30.400]  at the end when they were fighting five to one and then 10 to one and more British landed
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:35.800]  15 to one, the British started going, what the hell's this guy got? Superpowers? Because
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:40.760]  everything they did turned against them. Not for the first half of the war, though, but
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:44.880]  they had to keep going, keep going, keep going with George Washington's will set against
[1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:49.680]  them. They could feel his will, but he was only a focal point of God blasting through
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:55.920]  him. And we have to do that. I'm telling you, God is blasting through Donald Trump, blasting.
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:27:00.840]  I'm spiritually discerning. I'm tuned in folks, and he's blasting now. I mean, I could hardly
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:08.520]  even just, just like, whoa. It's like, man, whoa, that's bright. That's power. Whoa. The
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:21.760]  enemy sees it too. They're like, yeah. Excuse me. Now, let me just stop right there. I need
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:24.680]  to fund this operation. You know, we have Milo on. I want to get a bunch of his book and
[1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:30.200]  sell it. We need to fund our operation and spread cultural awakening. And whether Milo's
[1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:33.760]  your cup of tea or not, it doesn't matter. He's reaching all the trendies and liberals
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:38.440]  and breaking their conditioning. And that's why they hate him so much. So the war, the
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:42.400]  you know, the Lord works in mysterious ways. The point is, is that we have to end this
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:45.840]  special today and it will end today. When I tell you, I have contracts on these specials
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:50.040]  and people want me to stop these because the other distributors are really upset. We got
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:54.000]  phone calls here saying you better not run that a few extra days like you always do.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:58.880]  You cut, you have to end the 25% off. They're already lowest price because I'd be a special
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:02.520]  agreement to even do this because again, the other distributors don't like it. Well,
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:06.160]  I'm sorry. We have the Alexa pure breeze, the best system out there for the price for
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:14.000]  $149. We have the water filtration system for $147. If the leading competitor for something
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:20.760]  not even as good as 250, you cannot beat these deals. They end tonight at midnight central
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:27.840]  time. infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com. We've got some specials there. They're gonna have

[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:45.880]  can do that. It's just as long as my hand can handle it. I got to sound like a thousand

[1:29:07.480 --> 1:29:12.120]  to win. That's what I care about. I hate seeing them create global zoning to rip off and hurt
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:16.680]  poor people. I hate seeing them put cancer viruses and vaccines. I just hate seeing them
[1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:21.280]  getting away with all the stuff. I want to beat them. I want to win. The globalists don't
[1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:25.960]  like seeing you succeed. They have a twisted competitiveness about them. That's that's
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:29.960]  a cancer. So thank you all for your support. God bless you. And thanks for the fellow that
[1:29:29.960 --> 1:29:34.520]  bought us a couple bowls of chili at the Texas chili parlor yesterday. Thank you to buddy.

[1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:06.360]  like statins, pain meds and antidepressants. And no, water treatment plants are not equipped

[1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:27.040]  flag and that flag is the American flag. Info wars helped fuel the rumor that President
[1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:33.000]  Obama is an ISIS supporter. It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning. I will not
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:38.520]  let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:52.200]  soon. This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States. And
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:58.760]  we're back. I want to open the phones up specifically on what you think about the move by Goldman
[1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:05.600]  Sachs and JPMorgan to announce that the stock market should go down and to tell their shareholders
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:09.480]  and to tell people that own different stocks and bonds that they control, but they should
[1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:16.840]  start dumping them and the dollar. When Trump's saying, believe in America, invest, get involved,
[1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:21.640]  I mean, that's how we're going to keep this collapse from taking place. And now you see
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:28.480]  these open enemies living against Trump. This should silence everyone that keeps saying
[1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:32.760]  he's run by Goldman Sachs when everything he does is the opposite of policies Goldman
[1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:46.560]  Sachs and JPMorgan support. The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-2599231.
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:52.240]  Before I go any further, I want to play the most viewed video in the history of numbers
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:35:00.640]  USA that breaks down the scientific facts of what massive unbridled third world immigration
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:08.040]  does to a wealthy country. And after we come back, I'm going to continue getting into the
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:13.520]  attempts to just say even our president has no right to control who comes into this country.
[1:35:13.520 --> 1:35:22.400]  Anybody can come here and just basically stay here as long as they are a political tool.
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:34.480]  Here's the report, World Poverty and Gumballs, number USA.
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:54.160]  Of course, we don't pull our immigrants from these desperately poor populations, do we?
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:36:00.080]  These people are too poor, too sick, too disconnected to make it here as immigrants.
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:05.760]  We tend to pull our immigrants out of the better off poor of the world, and Mexico tends
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:10.160]  to define the type of immigrant that we bring here because the plurality of people come
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:16.440]  from Mexico. And Mexico is poor. How many people in the world live in countries that
[1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:23.400]  have average incomes lower than that of Mexico? And the World Bank tells us that that number
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:40.600]  is these 3 billion plus another 2.6 billion people. 5.6 billion people in the world who
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:48.000]  live in countries with average incomes below that of Mexico. That's 5,600 gumballs. And
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.800]  so what is it that the elites are telling us? They're telling us that when we take this
[1:36:52.800 --> 1:37:00.480]  one million immigrants, that we somehow or another are tackling world poverty, and we
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:04.440]  have to do it regardless of the effect on our unemployed, the working poor, the most
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:09.240]  vulnerable members of our society, regardless of the effect on our natural resources, even
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:17.000]  if we went by the most radical proposals in Washington, which are to actually double our
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:24.920]  immigration to 2 million a year, which would totally overwhelm our physical, natural and
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:29.720]  social infrastructures, we couldn't make a noticeable difference. And we may be really
[1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:37.400]  hurting the impoverished people of the world because the million that we do take are among
[1:37:37.400 --> 1:37:43.640]  the most energetic, often the better educated, certainly the most dissatisfied people that
[1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:50.640]  if they did not immigrate would be the agents for change, to improve a lot of all the people
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:56.160]  in these countries. The true heroes in the global humanitarian field are the people in
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:38:01.080]  these countries who have the wherewithal to immigrate to another country, but instead
[1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:08.480]  stay in their countries to apply their skills to help their fellow countrymen. Unfortunately,
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:15.000]  our immigration system tends to entice these very type of people to abandon their countrymen.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:24.480]  The impossibility of making even a dent is actually worse than it looks here, because
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:32.440]  last year when we took 1 million immigrants, these countries added, births over deaths,
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:40.440]  80 million more people into the impoverished population. And this year, Congress is bringing
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:47.560]  in a million legal immigrants. And this year, according to the United Nations, these countries
[1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:53.080]  are expected to add another 80 million people. And next year, you could be quite sure that
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:39:01.800]  Congress, unless stopped by the American voters, will bring in another million immigrants.
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:08.000]  And these countries, unfortunately, will be adding another 80 million people into these
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:16.040]  impoverished nations. We could take 5 million a year, but we'd never get ahead of what's
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:22.200]  happening in these countries, not in this century. Don't you see? Immigration can never
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:28.640]  be an effective or significant way to deal with the suffering people of the world. They
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:37.920]  have to be helped where they live. 99.9 percent of them will never be able to immigrate to
[1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:42.200]  a rich country. There's no hope for that. They have to bloom where they're planted.
[1:39:42.200 --> 1:39:51.360]  The only place that 99.9 percent of these people can be helped is where they live. Let's help
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:40:20.120]  them there.
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:31.280]  The Royal Commission on Population in 1949 said the Third World is going to overpopulate
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:36.320]  for their resources, and we could go in and industrialize them very quickly, but then
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:40.640]  they would be competitors to the West and our colonialism. So instead, we're just going
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:46.800]  to encourage their overpopulation and then use that to basically exploit those populations
[1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:50.720]  and only have certain development zones within the countries so they don't actually get
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:55.920]  the industry for themselves. They don't get the First World status, but we exploit them
[1:40:55.920 --> 1:41:02.760]  and then come and dominate the West and consolidate control here. Now, I learned about the Royal
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:08.440]  Commission whenever I was given, like 18 years ago, by Lyndon LaRouche Acolyte, one of their
[1:41:08.440 --> 1:41:13.680]  quarterly intelligence reports, but back then the Internet wasn't very accurate or wasn't
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:18.600]  very detailed. There wasn't a lot of stuff you could find on it. I went to the UT laboratory
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:28.440]  and I actually had them pull out of the stacks a synopsis in a UT review from the 50s of
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:35.920]  the World Population Forum and the Commission on it that had been established by his Royal
[1:41:35.920 --> 1:41:41.960]  Highness in England in 1949, Queen Elizabeth II's father. It wasn't the whole report,
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:47.720]  but it was many pages of it in footnotes admitting just what Lyndon LaRouche had said, who by
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:52.400]  the way was in OSS and then CIA obviously and a lot of other things. Ronald Reagan would
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:57.160]  meet with him weekly. He'd fly up by helicopter to meet with him at the White House. That
[1:41:57.160 --> 1:42:03.360]  was before Reagan got shot, but Reagan was reading his stuff and was impressed with him
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:06.960]  and they get really worried about presidents that listen to people that understand what's
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:11.040]  going on. Do you say what you want about the LaRouche group? I don't agree with their
[1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:16.560]  policies, how they want to fix things. It's very socialist, but at least it's infrastructure-based
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:24.400]  and human-based. So it's a real liberal system that is really honorable and very respectable.
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:30.320]  I'm not part of that group. I'm just telling you that what they propose is very real. Okay,
[1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:35.840]  and he's been a guest on many times. He's over 92 years old now and we haven't been able to
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:39.120]  get him on lately for obvious reasons, but he was still totally there about two years
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:45.360]  ago when I last interviewed him. Truly amazing. They were Quakers, so he wouldn't go into
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:50.920]  combat, wouldn't have a gun, but instead they put him in all sorts of really dangerous situations
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:58.680]  all over India and China during World War II. That guy saw a lot and SDI was his idea
[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:01.280]  so much more. I don't want to go off on a jag about Lyndon LaRouche. I want to go to your
[1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:06.640]  phone calls after this clip. I'm going to play. It's just that people say, oh, we're
[1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:10.480]  not overpopulated. Everybody in the world could live in Texas. Yeah, but they couldn't
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:15.280]  live with a life. And I'm going to agree with the globalist going to forcibly depopulate
[1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:19.840]  or sterilize people. The point is they let it bloom. Now they're acting like they're
[1:43:19.840 --> 1:43:25.120]  going to do something with sterilizing vaccines. We're overpopulated for the technology we
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:32.120]  have. If we innovate and if we did things with like new energy systems, many of the
[1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:38.120]  statistics and research papers show we could actually really, really produce an even larger
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:42.200]  population. But here's the truth. The population is going to peak at 9 billion in the next
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:47.160]  15 years to start declining and then start collapsing because we don't have 2.1 children
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:52.240]  for every two adults. Civilization begins unravel. They believe robotics and stuff is
[1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:55.840]  going to keep that from happening, but they're really using robotics is to get rid of humans
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:00.440]  altogether. So a very nasty world's being built. And if they would have industrialized
[1:44:00.440 --> 1:44:07.840]  Latin America, Africa and other countries and not just and I know Africa is a continent
[1:44:07.840 --> 1:44:13.800]  and other regions, then people would have had two children on average or even less.
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:18.480]  And you wouldn't have this issue and there wouldn't be needs for advancing technology.
[1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:28.120]  But now we're sitting on top a gigantic six plus billion time bomb. Understand that Mexico
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:34.560]  is on the high end of wealthy poor countries. Everybody wants to get to Mexico. You go to
[1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:40.280]  some areas of Mexico, it looks sewage down the street. People that are starving corrupt
[1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:45.640]  police and it's scary. But there's some highly cultured areas and great art and great literature
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:49.800]  and great movies and the Mexico's got what it takes. They've just never gotten out from
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:44:58.000]  under colonialism with some of the best food, best movies, best music, best art, architecture.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:03.440]  Mexico's got everything it needs resources to but never got under from L. Hefe's. They
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:07.880]  want to keep people poor to control them. It's called serfdom, it's called feudalism
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:12.600]  and that's what the globalists have established worldwide. And they want it here in America
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:18.800]  and in Europe now and they're trying to bankrupt Trump's plan to reboot the West and the Renaissance
[1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:23.200]  and then empower the third world and make deals everywhere. You can't have a one sided
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:26.280]  deal that helps the third world because it doesn't even help them. It helps the globalist
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:30.480]  use the one sided deal to play monopoly in the West and consolidate control. We've been
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:36.200]  part of an economic war folks, not an economy. We've been paying for it, it's been at our
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:40.400]  expense to build the world government for the new world order and Stephen Bannon writes
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.960]  white papers explaining that. That's why they want Bannon out of there. They're horrified
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:52.960]  of Bannon. He gets the whole thing. Bannon used to be a big liberal, big union guy but
[1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:56.840]  he really wanted to help people. That's what they're doing right now, trying to get loans
[1:45:56.840 --> 1:46:03.120]  to small businesses. People ought to be kissing the feet of Trump. If you're a black American
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:06.880]  you ought to be kissing his feet. If you're a white American you should be kissing his
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:10.840]  feet because let me tell you something. These people are really committed. Just look at the
[1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:14.400]  look on Bannon's face right there. That's a guy on a suicide mission. He looks satisfied,
[1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:18.280]  he looks focused, he knows what he's doing, he knows the show. He doesn't have that normal
[1:46:18.280 --> 1:46:23.720]  narcissistic nutball look in his eyes. But forget how he looks. But does he look like
[1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:29.320]  a nice guy, a smart guy? Look at his actions and it's the same thing across the board except
[1:46:29.320 --> 1:46:35.480]  when you get to the Republicans he brought in. Now, I promise to get to this. I'm going
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:40.320]  to play it and then we'll get to your calls to Ken and Kimberly and Judy and Chris and
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:45.800]  Donald. But here's just part of this Mark Dice video, the craziest social justice warriors
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:53.680]  on earth because it's important to look at how dumbed down the people are we're facing.
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:57.960]  And it's not something we celebrate and make fun of. This is to show what they've done
[1:46:57.960 --> 1:47:03.880]  to these people. Here it is. The Confederate flags are coming down to end the era of racism
[1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:12.480]  and it's time to implement a new American flag for the new America. And so we're getting
[1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:20.360]  some signatures here. Print, birthed in a signature. The old stars and stripes represent
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:27.840]  the old world, the imperialistic America and this petition is going to implement a new
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:35.920]  American flag banning the current American flag. Thank you for supporting that. And another
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:43.600]  signature there. What we were thinking is maybe like a pyramid or something to represent
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:50.800]  the new world order and the new America. And so just to replace the petition is to replace
[1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:56.480]  the current American flag. It's a new flag for the new world order, wouldn't you agree?
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:04.040]  It's time for that. Appreciate your support. Thank you. And part of ending the discrimination
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:08.920]  against transgender people in the bathrooms is to be really installing some urinals into
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:14.440]  the women's bathrooms to accommodate the trans women who still have a penis so that they don't
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:20.120]  feel like they're not welcome there anymore. So it makes sense. I think everyone should
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:30.320]  just use the same bathroom. Well, that might be the next step, but this petition will,
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:36.320]  yeah, birthed in a signature. This petition, like I said, will start installing urinals
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:42.200]  into the women's bathrooms to help accommodate the trans or the gender non binary or gender
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:46.480]  non conforming and gender fluid people as well. So thanks for supporting that. Appreciate
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:54.040]  that. Just trying to stop Donald Trump any way we can. So by getting the illegal aliens,
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:49:01.080]  yeah, okay, you can print there then I guess. Just trying to get the illegal aliens allowed
[1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:08.240]  to vote this election to stop Donald Trump. So we figure desperate times call for desperate
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:13.920]  measures. Thank you for supporting that. The white privilege tax just a small 1% on the
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:19.440]  Caucasians to help fund programs in the minority community. We're gonna take that silver spoon
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:22.440]  out of the white people's mouths. We're gonna put it back into yours. Appreciate it, man.
[1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:26.840]  You guys deserve that. Aren't you white? Yeah, but you know what? I have enjoyed the white
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:29.920]  privilege myself. So I'm trying to get back to the African American community with the
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:34.200]  white privilege tax. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. Appreciate that. All right. You find the
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:38.600]  petition to put Obama on Mount Rushmore? Trying to darken it up a little bit. Oh, really?
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:45.280]  Yeah. There's a bunch of old white men up there. So I think he probably deserves a place
[1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:52.440]  in history up up there, one of the greatest presidents ever. You support Obama in repealing
[1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:57.840]  the Bill of Rights? Yeah, sir. We just a name and a signature. We're doing everything
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:03.400]  we can to help Obama modernize the Bill of Rights in today's New World Order, today's
[1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:11.600]  society. So we're helping to support him repealing the Bill of Rights. Birthday, please, to repeal
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:18.640]  the Bill of Rights. I don't think we really need those and a signature to repeal the Bill
[1:50:18.640 --> 1:50:24.680]  of Rights as well. You just helped us repeal the Bill of Rights. Thanks, bro. It's microwaves.
[1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:31.240]  I've kind of replaced them. It's the old microwave. But if you want a pressure cooker, just submit
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:37.640]  to a background check first. And that way we could be sure to be safe. So a lot of restaurants
[1:50:37.640 --> 1:50:46.440]  use them for roasting meats, but that's only an area I can't go to. You're listening to
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:55.040]  Alex Jones. Happy Valentine's Day, honey. Wow, look at these roses. They're gorgeous.

[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:03.560]  you with flowers. Oh, thank you. Guys, this Valentine's Day, even though she says you

[1:52:49.960 --> 1:52:55.800]  Hi, my name's John Kunkel. I'm 63 years of age. I watch several YouTube videos of Steven
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:53:00.200]  Hewer's and learn what supplements might help me with energy and weight loss. I've now but

[1:37:27.700 --> 1:54:21.200]  speaking right now in Florida at a military base, I guess close to Special
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:25.280]  Operations Command and Air Force Base. Talking about strengthening the U.S. military, but
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:29.440]  not letting a bunch of fraud, waste, and abuse go on. Talking about taking care of veterans,
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:33.680]  things like that. Let's play a few minutes of this. Sorry, callers. You're getting preempted
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:37.160]  by the president. We will get to Kimberly and Kevin and Judy and Chris and Donald and
[1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:40.240]  everybody else. Here's the president being introduced.
[1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:47.640]  Thank you all. We have tremendous spirit, and I want to thank you. We had a wonderful
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:57.000]  election, didn't we? And I saw those numbers. And you like me and I like you. That's the
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:03.200]  way it works. I'm honored to be here today among so many of our really and truly great
[1:55:03.200 --> 1:55:12.520]  heroes. I want to begin by thanking General Votel and General Thomas for their distinguished
[1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:21.440]  leadership and service on behalf of our country. Very, very outstanding people. I'd also like
[1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:27.240]  to thank General Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That's big stuff
[1:55:27.240 --> 1:55:31.240]  when you have the chairman. Where is it? Joe, stand up for a second. This is one of the
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:44.840]  great people. Thank you. Also, Commander Vogel and everyone serving at McDale Air Force Base,
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:50.000]  quite a place. And we're going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.800]  new equipment. You've been lacking a little equipment. We're going to load it up. You're
[1:55:53.800 --> 1:56:03.720]  going to get a lot of equipment. So importantly also, let me thank all of the coalition partners
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:10.800]  and their representatives assembled here today. We proudly, very proudly, stand with you.
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:16.240]  And we will be fighting for your security. They're fighting for our security and freedom.
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:21.120]  Let me recognize our great governor and a very good friend of mine. And just to pay this
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:24.240]  time for a minute, I was walking in and saw he was giving a speech and was just kind of
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:27.840]  guessing where he was at because I knew which air base it was. He's at the U.S. Central
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:33.240]  Command headquarters. Keep going. You can talk, but it never means the same. But this
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:38.640]  man is a great, great governor and has done a fantastic job. Rick Scott, Governor, stand
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:47.480]  up please. All hands address. And I backed us up about five minutes. He's already into
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:53.000]  it. Finally, on behalf of the entire nation, let me express our gratitude to all members,
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:59.720]  and I mean all members, of our military serving in the United States Central Command and the
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:06.840]  United States Special Operations Command. We salute the Army, Marine Corps, Navy Air Force
[1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:13.400]  and Coast Guard, along with our civilian defense personnel who are so important to the success
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:19.440]  of what we're doing. Let me also recognize the military families and spouses who bravely
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:25.640]  shoulder the burdens of war. I want every military family in this country to know that
[1:57:25.640 --> 1:57:34.240]  our administration is at your service. We stand with you 100 percent. We will protect those
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:42.720]  who protect us, and we will never, ever let you down. As your president, I have no higher
[1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:47.680]  duty than to protect the American people. All right, let's stop right there. I've got
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:52.680]  Doug Hagman coming up with big, breaking the unspoken word, pizza gate. If you can say
[1:57:52.680 --> 1:57:57.640]  it, they did list you on YouTube, iTunes, you name it. When all we're doing is covering
[1:57:57.640 --> 1:58:02.440]  what has really developed there, since then confirming a lot of what the NYPD first told
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:07.720]  us. But I promise to go to calls. So I'm going to back Hagman up, tell him he'll do the rest
[1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:14.400]  of the hour, just about 15 after. Hagman will be fine with it. A great guy so that I can
[1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:18.560]  go to your calls. Kevin and Kimberly and Judy and Chris and Donald and a few others.
[1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:23.640]  And then we'll also open the phones up specifically on pizza gate because a lot of fake news got
[1:58:23.640 --> 1:58:28.440]  put out on that, not by us, but by MSM, as straw men to then attach to us. But now, since
[1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:33.200]  then, a lot's coming out and pedophile networks are getting arrested by the hundreds all over
[1:58:33.200 --> 1:58:41.080]  the country because now President Trump's taking the gloves off.
[1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:45.640]  Ted Malik, the man tipped as Trump's selection for US ambassador to the EU, is not welcomed
[1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:49.880]  by the EU bureaucrats. There's a move in Brussels to block Trump's pick, but Malik
[1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:55.080]  replied, Well, I had in a previous career, a diplomatic post where I helped to bring
[1:58:55.080 --> 1:58:58.640]  down the Soviet Union. So maybe there's another union that needs a little taming.
[1:58:58.640 --> 1:59:03.200]  Trump's pick for EU ambassador illustrates wise, strategic thinking in the chess game
[1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:07.480]  against the globalists. Ted Malik's credentials read like the perfect resume of an elitist.
[1:59:07.480 --> 1:59:12.600]  In fact, he even wrote a biography titled Davos, Aspen and Yale, but it's a tagline
[1:59:12.600 --> 1:59:17.840]  that says it all. My life behind the curtains as a global sherpa. He knows globalism from
[1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:22.480]  the inside, having served as an expert to prepare summits, and he will serve them no
[1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:26.640]  more. But the UN is the center, the driving force of globalism. So why not put someone
[1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:30.960]  like Malik on point there rather than an establishment figure like Nikki Haley? If
[1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:35.360]  they can aid European nations in resting their sovereignty back from Brussels, Trump will
[1:59:35.360 --> 1:59:38.640]  have allies in the fight against the United Nations.
[1:59:38.640 --> 2:00:05.920]  RenfaWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:17.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:22.160]  I should have plugged the last two hours. The Doug Hagman was coming on. Anthony Weiner
[2:00:22.160 --> 2:00:27.440]  may get slapped with child pornography charges. You heard that here first from our NYPD sources.
[2:00:27.440 --> 2:00:31.480]  Then I talked to Hagman. He had other sources off air. He gave me the sources that were
[2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:39.400]  separate from mine. It just gets worse from there. 474 arrested, 28 sexually exploited
[2:00:39.400 --> 2:00:44.560]  children rescued, statewide human trafficking operation. This is going on all over folks.
[2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:50.880]  This is big. That's coming up. It makes me so angry. They're trying to implode the economy
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:57.200]  right now to stop Trump and admitting they're doing it. It's like at a certain point, Bloomberg
[2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:02.920]  and Soros and these globalists and the Rockefellers and all the rest of them just need to stop
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:08.040]  it. Trump's going to let you keep all your stolen wealth. Just stop trying to make us
[2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:14.360]  poor, man. You're super uncool. You're super uncool.
[2:01:14.360 --> 2:01:23.120]  People like that. I'm a very long shelf life in my humble opinion. For every action, there's
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:27.320]  an equal and opposite reaction. We're getting sick of you thinking you're above the law.
[2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:31.720]  Let's go ahead and go to Judy in Florida. You're on here, Judy. What do you make of?
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:34.600]  I thought Trump worked for Goldman Sachs. They didn't give him any money. They gave
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:37.800]  all the money to Hillary and now they're openly trying to plunge the stock market to stop
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:41.920]  him. I mean, I thought he worked for Goldman Sachs.
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:50.120]  Well, as far as I'm concerned, anything is going to be said by any globalist talking
[2:01:50.120 --> 2:01:56.040]  head, including a Paul Ryan, that they're going to find ways of breaking the confidence
[2:01:56.040 --> 2:02:01.680]  of the American people. And of course, Goldman Sachs is going to be one to say, yeah, going
[2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:05.720]  ahead and sell off your stocks, you know, it's good for you to do. And, you know, Trump's
[2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:09.760]  a loser. He's killing the economy. I mean, it's pretty ridiculous.
[2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:14.360]  And so that's the bad guys trying to wreck the economy. Like we're stupid. They admit
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:18.800]  they're trying to wreck it to stop Trump as if they won't get the blame. They think Trump
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:22.600]  will get the blame. But see, they're talking to their constituents that are stupid. So
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:24.720]  what should we do about this?
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:30.480]  Well, hopefully Trump's going to be able to stay alive and be in office long enough
[2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:35.840]  that the only thing that I agreed with with the LaRouche political action committee gets
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:37.720]  re-implemented and that's Glass-Steagall.
[2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:41.840]  Oh, that's one more thing I forgot to mention. He's trying to do right now. It's like he's
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:46.680]  doing so much good. I can't even think of it all. There's so much because every time
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:50.920]  I think I've thought of it all, there's one more. There's one more. There's one more.
[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:55.240]  There is something else that I wanted to bring up to you that is of extreme importance to
[2:02:55.240 --> 2:03:00.000]  me and I think it would be an excellent guest for you. This is a gentleman that grew up
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:06.480]  in Egypt. He's a Baptist Christian and his father was too. He preached a lot and he got,
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:11.560]  of course, persecuted because of it. But he was also taught on a compulsory level the
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:17.640]  Quran and Sharia. And he has written a book. I've seen this gentleman in person three times
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:24.240]  now. He's written a book called The Generous Quran, which is a literal translation of the
[2:03:24.240 --> 2:03:31.960]  Arabic into English with footnotes. And this guy is an extraordinary wealth of knowledge
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:34.360]  about the Quran and people need to understand.
[2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:38.240]  What's his name? What's his name? We'll look into getting him on.
[2:03:38.240 --> 2:03:51.960]  I actually have had other people contact me. I don't even know who these people are. They're
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:55.800]  like text messaging my phone. They got my number saying I should have him on. So I will
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:04:01.040]  definitely look into it. He comes recommended by other folks as well, not just people battling
[2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:05.080]  to get my phone number. So I will look into it. God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:10.240]  I mean, just in closing, I hate to fawn over Trump, but I really find no fault at this
[2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:16.840]  point, which is head spinning. I appreciate your call. We're gonna come back and go to
[2:04:16.840 --> 2:04:21.000]  Kevin and Kimberly and Chris and Donald and I'll get to others with Hagman. I feel like
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:27.320]  I broadcast for like 10 hours today, but I'm just so frustrated because it's like, it's
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:33.600]  so horrible. Globalism is so evil. They admit it's evil. And I don't even hate these idiots
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:37.360]  that are out there burning stuff and attacking women. I feel sorry for them because they're
[2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:44.000]  so stupid. That mean they, they don't know anything. They can't even talk, but they have
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:48.280]  a spirit of evil, don't they? This just makes me so sad. All Trump's trying to do is help
[2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:49.280]  them.
[2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:55.600]  Head Malik, the man tipped as Trump's selection for US ambassador to the EU is not welcomed
[2:04:55.600 --> 2:04:59.880]  by the EU bureaucrats. There's a move in Brussels to block Trump's pick, but Malik
[2:04:59.880 --> 2:05:05.080]  replied, well, I had in a previous career, a diplomatic post where I helped to bring
[2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:08.680]  down Soviet Union. So maybe there's another union that needs a little taming. Trump's
[2:05:08.680 --> 2:05:14.440]  pick for EU ambassador illustrates wise strategic thinking in the chess game against the globalists.
[2:05:14.440 --> 2:05:18.440]  Ted Malik's credentials read like the perfect resume of an elitist. In fact, he even wrote
[2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:23.600]  a biography titled Davos, Aspen and Yale, but it's the tagline that says it all. My
[2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:28.720]  life behind the curtains as a global Sherpa. He knows globalism from the inside, having
[2:05:28.720 --> 2:05:33.800]  served as an expert to prepare summits, and he will serve them no more. But the UN is
[2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:37.480]  the center, the driving force of globalism. So why not put someone like Malik on point
[2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:41.920]  there rather than an establishment figure like Nikki Haley? If they can aid European
[2:05:41.920 --> 2:05:46.400]  nations and resting their sovereignty back from Brussels, Trump will have allies in the
[2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:48.200]  fight against the United Nations.
[2:05:48.200 --> 2:06:01.600]  For info wars.com, I'm David Knight, and all the great products info wars.com as you
[2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:05.760]  know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the
[2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:11.520]  answer is clear. Iodine is key is paramount. And there's still so much new information
[2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:16.800]  coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine.
[2:06:16.800 --> 2:06:22.040]  We drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the
[2:06:22.040 --> 2:06:27.440]  ultra pure iodine. On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[2:06:27.440 --> 2:06:31.920]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there. Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with
[2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:36.760]  the launch of survival shield, Nathan Iodine, that major brands and major companies have
[2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:40.480]  been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up
[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:46.840]  with anything even close to what we have. It is exclusive to info wars life.com and the
[2:06:46.840 --> 2:06:50.480]  info wars life family of incredible products.
[2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:57.480]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America? They lost. We won. Want to see what Trump's
[2:06:57.480 --> 2:07:05.480]  up against? Revelation. The movie.info. Because of what we did on this day, change has come
[2:07:05.480 --> 2:07:06.480]  to America.
[2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:12.480]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance. When I
[2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:19.480]  was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, gobs and
[2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:27.480]  school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government.
[2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:31.480]  We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more to it than that.
[2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:37.480]  Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels and special ops general, Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings
[2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:44.480]  on demand, DVDs now available. Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Americans
[2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:51.480]  need to see this film. Revelation. The movie.info. Let's fix it.
[2:07:51.480 --> 2:07:59.480]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, deep in the heart of Texas, hence
[2:07:59.480 --> 2:08:09.480]  Alex Jones. I hear people talking about the way we have to live here in this country.
[2:08:09.480 --> 2:08:17.480]  Harping on wars, we fight and griping about the way things are to be. And I don't mind
[2:08:17.480 --> 2:08:24.480]  them switching sides and standing up to things they believe in. When they're running down
[2:08:24.480 --> 2:08:29.480]  my country, man, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[2:08:29.480 --> 2:08:38.480]  Yeah, they're walking. We've got Trump ongoing giving a speech at a Florida Air Force base
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:43.480]  right now. We'll have some excerpts of that coming up with David Knight, host for fourth
[2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:47.480]  hour today. He's got a lot more to cover as well. Doug Hack will be with us here in about
[2:08:47.480 --> 2:08:50.480]  six, seven minutes. In fact, he's ready right now. We're going to him in just a moment.
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:56.480]  But I promise to get to these callers. We're going to run through as quickly as I can.
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:01.480]  I don't like having to cover pedophilia, but this is what the elites are into and it keeps
[2:09:01.480 --> 2:09:06.480]  coming out. And in history, it keeps coming out. So there's just something and a certain
[2:09:06.480 --> 2:09:12.480]  percentage of twisted people's minds that want power so they can abuse children or is it
[2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:17.480]  they want power and they like to abuse children. That's the criminology. And he's a criminologist,
[2:09:17.480 --> 2:09:23.480]  advises FBI, state police, local police. It was Doug Hagman. I mean, I had sources saying
[2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:28.480]  that there was a child porn investigation on Wiener. And then Hagman came out and had
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:33.480]  his sources that even more. He was even showing us the redacted photos that weren't pornographic
[2:09:33.480 --> 2:09:40.480]  that went along with it on air. And then Eric Prince of XZ and all the other names of his
[2:09:40.480 --> 2:09:44.480]  contractor group came out and said, I have high level law enforcement saying that this
[2:09:44.480 --> 2:09:50.480]  pizza gate thing's real. Now he called it the emails. They created pizza gate in that
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:55.480]  term to get us focused on to that as a red herring. And I guess got, you know, it's David
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:10:00.480]  Brock's boyfriend or whatever. I mean, I'm speculating, you know, as to why they picked
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:06.480]  that place where the Democrats hang out to be the victim, to be the straw man, like a
[2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:12.480]  mother bird, like her wings broken, too close to the nest. But then I'm not saying Brock
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:16.480]  or his boyfriend or anybody's involved in all this. It's just, it gets too weird now
[2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:20.480]  that Wiener is set to be indicted reportedly for child porn. And you know, I heard that
[2:10:20.480 --> 2:10:25.480]  was confirmed last week. I went, oh, that's horrible. I wish I was wrong. I wish NYPD was
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:30.480]  wrong. Oh, I wish, you know, they were just putting kids in the hot tub for entertainment,
[2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:36.480]  you know, whatever entertainment is, or I wish Obama really was buying $65,000 worth of
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:41.480]  hot dogs. And I really wish spirit cooking, you know, wasn't an Alistair Crowley ritual.
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:46.480]  You know what folks? It is. I don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes. Okay. All these
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:51.480]  weirdos wanting to be shocking or whatever. You know, I just hope it's like Halloween costumes
[2:10:51.480 --> 2:10:56.480]  gone wrong. It's not. Now the question is how deep should it go? We'll talk to Hagman.
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:01.480]  And again, people ask, well, why'd you drop it? I didn't drop it, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:07.480]  They were producing fake news pieces every day. Okay. Where they said I was saying that
[2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:12.480]  women like Hillary were torturing children to death in the bottom of a pizza place in
[2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:17.480]  DC. I never said that. They were editing audio together and Megan Kelly was airing it. And
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:22.480]  at that point, anything I said, they were taking on a context. So I know when to pull back,
[2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:28.480]  not a fear, but waiting for more to come out and waiting for Trump to be able to get in.
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:33.480]  Cause the word was, yeah, let Trump get in and then the stuff's going to start happening.
[2:11:33.480 --> 2:11:38.480]  Well, you know what? Anthony Weiner may get slapped with child pornography charges. New
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:45.480]  York Post. That's basically the mouth of the Trump right there. 474 arrested 28 sexually
[2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:50.480]  exploited children rescued during statewide human trafficking operation just last week.
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:58.480]  That's LA news, Los Angeles police department, County Sheriff and just arrest all over the
[2:11:58.480 --> 2:12:02.480]  country. They arrested a bunch of guys in Pennsylvania, raping kids reportedly in, in, in, in, in,
[2:12:02.480 --> 2:12:10.480]  in teddy bear outfits. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Okay. And so we're going to
[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:19.480]  cover it with Hagman here in just a minute because the word is Trump's put the word out
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:24.480]  to law enforcement. We're going to back you when you've got these people and we've seen
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:28.480]  pits come out and speak out against it. He's gone to the pro-life events. They've sent
[2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:32.480]  the signal to the military that there's no limits going after people. The gloves are
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:35.480]  off. And that's why Hillary and all of them are fighting for their lives and being so
[2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:39.480]  aggressive and not stopping and trying to cause a civil war because they know Trump
[2:12:39.480 --> 2:12:43.480]  means to clean house. We'll go to Hagman here in just one moment. At first off, holding
[2:12:43.480 --> 2:12:49.480]  the longest here would be Kimberly in Idaho. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[2:12:49.480 --> 2:12:55.480]  Hi, Alex. It's so nice to talk to you. I have wanted to talk to you for so long. It's so
[2:12:55.480 --> 2:13:03.480]  hard to get through on the phone sometimes. I just wanted to know why isn't George Soros
[2:13:03.480 --> 2:13:09.480]  and his son charged as an enemy of the state? I mean, we could use the money that he has
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:15.480]  leveraged against, you know, currency crashing to pay down our national debt.
[2:13:15.480 --> 2:13:21.480]  Sure. Sure. It's the same reason I'm still on air is I'm protected by God. He's protected
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:25.480]  by the devil. That's the best info we've got. And he knows where all the bodies are buried.
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:29.480]  He's got all sorts of trap doors and naked shorts and threatens to wreck the economy.
[2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:34.480]  So the globalists act like they want to work with Trump, but then under the surface
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:38.480]  attacking. So Trump's trying to not have a war. He's trying to just fix things and have
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:42.480]  so much prosperity they back off. But now Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bloomberg, they've
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:46.480]  all seen it. They've all come out and said dump your stocks, bring down Trump, which
[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:50.480]  means bring down the people and that the prosperity is over to try to sabotage this
[2:13:50.480 --> 2:13:56.480]  nationalist movement. Just like with Brexit, the EU unelected tyranny is trying to sabotage
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:14:01.480]  them. And so this is all like a Mexican standoff where everybody's got guns on each other.
[2:14:01.480 --> 2:14:06.480]  We'll talk to Hagman about that in a moment, but they are really hyping economic downfall
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:11.480]  trying to think we're so dumb that if they're successful in a depression or a recession
[2:14:11.480 --> 2:14:16.480]  expanding that somehow it's Trump's fault when he had everything turbocharged and working.
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:21.480]  So they're trying to blow this Trump rocket up on the tarmac. In fact, we'll just have
[2:14:21.480 --> 2:14:25.480]  Hagman co-host with these callers and then get to the latest on pizza again at the bottom
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:29.480]  of the hour. But that's a great point. You know, Hagman, I've got these callers on and
[2:14:29.480 --> 2:14:34.480]  then pop back in camera in a moment. Of course, Hagman and Hagman talk show, very popular.
[2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:38.480]  Of course, they have a law enforcement advisory group and they also have the Northeast intelligence
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:42.480]  network with Hagman report.com. I'm not going to go over your whole bio in the interest of time,
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:47.480]  but clearly they're openly trying to plunge the stock market and the economy right now
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:54.480]  dug to kill the economy. What do we do? How do we respond to this? What can you add to
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:15:00.480]  what she just said? Why Soros is allowed to overthrow countries, fund the Islamic jihad,
[2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:05.480]  overthrow of nations, total evil, try to bet against the dollar. They're in the news saying
[2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:08.480]  plunge the dollar. Why? Why is he allowed to do this?
[2:15:08.480 --> 2:15:13.480]  A great question. And by the way, Soros also, the favorite Prince of George Soros are also
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:22.480]  on the anti ban or the ban, the anti Trump initiative to extremely vet or extreme vetting
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:31.480]  of the refugees or the immigrants coming in. But as to the why, it's my view and based on
[2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:35.480]  everything I've been told is the fact that there's two types of politicians inside the
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:41.480]  beltway, those that are bribed and those that are compromised. And so you're seeing this,
[2:15:41.480 --> 2:15:48.480]  whether you're Republican or Democrat, you're seeing this pushback. You're seeing this fear
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:54.480]  of being exposed, whether it's the immorality of the politicians or of the criminality of
[2:15:54.480 --> 2:16:00.480]  the politicians. So there's this hands off a soft glove approach to people like Soros
[2:16:00.480 --> 2:16:05.480]  and those people who he funds and backs and Soros is behind a lot of stuff. But it's just
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:11.480]  not him. It's there are sure he's the focal point of that whole shadow global system.
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:17.480]  Exactly. Yeah. So so and you had mentioned earlier in the program, they would want to
[2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:21.480]  take Trump out. And there's three different methods. Robert Davis Steele, I'm sure you're
[2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:27.480]  familiar with them. Three different ways to take Trump out. One, of course, is by assassination.
[2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:32.480]  God forbid. The second, of course, is through impeachment, which the articles of impeachment
[2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:38.480]  are being compiled via David Brock media matters for America and the Soros funded groups there.
[2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:42.480]  And the third, of course, is to just make the next four years of living hell for Trump
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:47.480]  and every person that is backing Trump through the riots and protests against Soros fingerprints
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:53.480]  are all across that as well as David Brock and many of the same people. So we're going
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:58.480]  to get to that more in a moment. Kimberly, anything else? Oh, yeah, I just wanted to ask
[2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:06.480]  you to I want to know if Hillary Clinton and Obama are going to be investigated and jailed.
[2:17:06.480 --> 2:17:11.480]  I mean, he wasn't even an American citizen and he's a he was our president. Now, that's
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:16.480]  right. The only promise that Trump hasn't kept so far is he said, if I become president,
[2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:19.480]  you should be in jail. Now, technically, he's not breaking the promise because it's not
[2:17:19.480 --> 2:17:24.480]  the president's job to do that. He's trying to appoint sessions who said, you know, if
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:29.480]  I'm confirmed, I will recuse myself when we go after Hillary. So he's not leaving a question
[2:17:29.480 --> 2:17:34.480]  mark in there. He's saying they're going to go after him. So I think that's why they're
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:39.480]  desperately fighting Trump so hard. But that's a good question, Doug. Yeah, I have no doubt
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:44.480]  in my mind that that's that's on the agenda of the that's on Trump's agenda. I think a
[2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:50.480]  couple of things right now, the sessions appointment, obviously confirmation that and also that
[2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:54.480]  they he's got to do some house cleaning within the various intelligence agencies, including
[2:17:54.480 --> 2:17:58.480]  but not limited to the FBI. There's moles everywhere. And he's also got to jumpstart the
[2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:03.480]  economy so that people are on his side when he moves against the enemy. Exactly. And that
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:09.480]  that's I've been told by a couple of FBI agents directly that, hey, there's a lot of things
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:14.480]  are taking place right now. Many of the career people don't like it. Some of the newcomers
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:20.480]  don't like it. But but the moral people do, in fact, welcome it. So we're going to see
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:24.480]  some things happen. And we've already seen, as you alluded to earlier, we've already seen
[2:18:24.480 --> 2:18:31.480]  some things, some things take place, including some arrests that were related to some pushback
[2:18:31.480 --> 2:18:35.480]  by the NYPD and the investigators from there. And you said that was coming. We're going to
[2:18:35.480 --> 2:18:38.480]  go to that coming up at the bottom of the hour. We're going to skip this break for more time.
[2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:42.480]  Thank you, Kimberly. Great questions. Let's talk to Kevin in Florida. You're on the air.
[2:18:42.480 --> 2:18:43.480]  Go ahead.
[2:18:43.480 --> 2:18:50.480]  Thank you, Alex. I just had this. I was thinking about this, this whole stock market analogy.
[2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:56.480]  And I equate it to, I feel like, like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs and Bank of America
[2:18:56.480 --> 2:19:00.480]  and all the big banks that are trying to implode the stock market. They're kind of like the
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:06.480]  cobwebs of the old West and Tombstone. And everything was going fine because there was
[2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:10.480]  no opposition, but now Donald Trump and Mike Pence roll in and they're like Wyatt Earp
[2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:16.480]  and Doc Holliday trying to restore some law and order. Absolutely. I mean, Pence, I'm
[2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:21.480]  really impressed with Pence now. Didn't know him that well. Trump, I'm so impressed. It's
[2:19:21.480 --> 2:19:26.480]  crazy. And again, if you just joined us in the first hour, I covered it. AP Reuters, CNN,
[2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:33.480]  MSNBC, just the Communist Chinese, everybody is betting, naked shorting, Soros trying to
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:37.480]  drive down our stock market, trying to drive down the dollar to blame Trump. And they're
[2:19:37.480 --> 2:19:42.480]  so arrogant, they're saying, we're going to plunge it to make him look bad. It's like,
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:47.480]  we're going to burn your house down to make you hate your neighbor and blame it on him.
[2:19:47.480 --> 2:19:52.480]  But you're telling me you're going to burn it down. Again, it's the arrogance, Doug.
[2:19:52.480 --> 2:20:00.480]  Absolutely. Yes. And I think Trump is doing a fine job with keeping his enemies close
[2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:05.480]  and everybody under surveillance. And that's kind of our mantra as well.
[2:20:05.480 --> 2:20:10.480]  Sure. And of course, we're not saying surveillance in the classical big brother sense, but he's
[2:20:10.480 --> 2:20:14.480]  watching what everybody's doing, watching what they're saying, watching what they do,
[2:20:14.480 --> 2:20:19.480]  and basically making a list. Because listen, I'm not somebody that wants authoritarianism.
[2:20:19.480 --> 2:20:24.480]  We've been invaded by globalists. We've been taken over. These are horrible people. At the
[2:20:24.480 --> 2:20:28.480]  top, they're a bunch of pedophiles. And so the gloves are off. They're openly in hundreds
[2:20:28.480 --> 2:20:32.480]  of publications saying kill Trump. They're openly saying kill their opposition. They're
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:36.480]  shutting down free speech. They're a foreign army. Gloves are off. Okay. And it's not because
[2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:40.480]  I have some fantasy about authoritarianism. I hate it, but we're in emergency cancer
[2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:45.480]  surgery here. And so quite frankly, he's been very restrained right now. I'm just wondering
[2:20:45.480 --> 2:20:49.480]  like you said, when the point comes, when the gloves come off, because to have all these
[2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:54.480]  major writers and people saying, let's kill Trump, that's not free speech. That's illegal.
[2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:59.480]  I mean, I'm sure you saw Doug, the former deputy of the Department of Defense went around
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:05.480]  last week and on TV and radio and print and is organizing a coup saying it's okay. Coups
[2:21:05.480 --> 2:21:12.480]  are no big deal. Let's have one. I mean, that's like terrorism. I mean, it's classic. I guarantee
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:18.480]  if I was like organizing in public, robbing a bank, I would be arrested within hours. And
[2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:22.480]  I should be or the cops are doing their job. This is flagrant illegal. So I'm going to
[2:21:22.480 --> 2:21:27.480]  press the president, but he's holding back. I think because he knows they're wanting to
[2:21:27.480 --> 2:21:31.480]  bait him in. I was in DC. I've seen the footage all over the country. They're targeting women,
[2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:36.480]  beating women up. They're saying kill Trump. They're clearly trying to bait him into some
[2:21:36.480 --> 2:21:40.480]  kind of move. Even when he does what he said he would do to control the borders and people
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:45.480]  coming in and vetted, they block that and say it's outrageous authoritarianism. So I think
[2:21:45.480 --> 2:21:47.480]  they're trying to set him up as a dictator.
[2:21:47.480 --> 2:21:53.480]  I think so as well. And look at people like Robert Reich, the former head of the Department
[2:21:53.480 --> 2:22:00.480]  of Labor. For example, coming out and saying, just as an example, saying that the rioters,
[2:22:00.480 --> 2:22:05.480]  the people who were brought in to create all this havoc and damage, were in fact paid
[2:22:05.480 --> 2:22:11.480]  by Trump people, pro-Trump people. The entire mess here.
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:16.480]  It's come out every time that it's the Soros and the Democrats doing. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:22:16.480 --> 2:22:23.480]  No, it just gives a whole new name to Reichstag, I suppose. But what you said is exactly right.
[2:22:23.480 --> 2:22:27.480]  And this is what I'm hearing again from my people inside the beltway is the fact that,
[2:22:27.480 --> 2:22:31.480]  all right, we have to watch this. We can't fall for the bait. We have to be smarter than
[2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:37.480]  they are and not react but respond. And there's a difference between reacting and responding.
[2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:41.480]  And of course, this is what Donald Trump is attempting to do based on the information I'm
[2:22:41.480 --> 2:22:42.480]  getting.
[2:22:42.480 --> 2:22:45.480]  All right, let's finish up with calls and get into the latest news. I don't want to call
[2:22:45.480 --> 2:22:49.480]  it an investigation. Everybody knows what that means now. Again, the media knew that we were
[2:22:49.480 --> 2:22:53.480]  on to the emails and all the weird sex trafficking stuff and spirit cooking and occult stuff.
[2:22:53.480 --> 2:22:56.480]  And we don't know who's innocent and who's guilty. It's all confusing. There's definitely
[2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:02.480]  a lot of weirdness going on. We're told by sources, it's wiener and child porn charges
[2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:07.480]  and underage stuff, sending photos. That's all come out now. So we're confirmed there.
[2:23:07.480 --> 2:23:11.480]  Suddenly, New York Times, Washington Post, others CNN go, oh, look at this poor pizza
[2:23:11.480 --> 2:23:15.480]  place, the center of the WikiLeaks claiming they're killing kids in a basement here. We
[2:23:15.480 --> 2:23:20.480]  look at the place. It's a little weird. It's got Democrats involved. But, you know, basements
[2:23:20.480 --> 2:23:27.480]  with kids in Hillary know they then straw man us and say that we're saying that to divert
[2:23:27.480 --> 2:23:33.480]  off the tens of thousands of emails, the cornucopia of sickening behavior. Now, though, we can
[2:23:33.480 --> 2:23:37.480]  double back and say, see what we originally talked about is coming out and you suddenly
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:41.480]  see law enforcement moving against these networks, which is what Doug Hagman said they would do
[2:23:41.480 --> 2:23:45.480]  after Trump got into office. We're two weeks in. We're now 17 days in less than two and
[2:23:45.480 --> 2:23:49.480]  a half weeks in. Doug has been proven crystal absolute on target with that that we go back
[2:23:49.480 --> 2:23:52.480]  to the last interviews with Doug hadn't been on since then. We're going to wait and see
[2:23:52.480 --> 2:23:55.480]  not that it trusting. We were just waiting to have it back on. It's happening now. So
[2:23:55.480 --> 2:23:59.480]  we'll get his latest intel coming up. But right now I was going to hold the longest
[2:23:59.480 --> 2:24:03.480]  here. Chris in Virginia, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:24:03.480 --> 2:24:08.480]  Yeah, that's why I believe it was very important for him to go with the blitz style attack
[2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:13.480]  of coming at everything, because I believe that they knew that the Democrats only strategy
[2:24:13.480 --> 2:24:19.480]  was the stall tactics. And the only thing the way to apply pressure on Congress is the
[2:24:19.480 --> 2:24:24.480]  work in a way that Congress is not used to. If you move real fast, they got a lot of things
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:30.480]  going on so that they're going to have to eventually get the gears of Congress rolling
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:35.480]  so they can get these laws going. And plus it throws a little diversion to his enemies
[2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:38.480]  so he can get other things done. Your thoughts.
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:42.480]  I agree. You're totally, you ought to be, you ought to host this show. Chris, I'm serious.
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:45.480]  You just crystallize what I've said in hours.
[2:24:45.480 --> 2:24:49.480]  Trump shouldn't get caught up on this immigration ban and the Ninth Circuit that's totally
[2:24:49.480 --> 2:24:53.480]  socialist and the most liberal and like he's getting beat and having a perfect record.
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:57.480]  He just needs to keep blitzing, blitzing, blitzing, blitzing, blitzing, blitzing, blitzing,
[2:24:57.480 --> 2:25:00.480]  blitzing and just run them over, Doug.
[2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:05.480]  I totally agree and I think he's going to have to watch. I think he is already watching
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:11.480]  and being very careful about who his friends in Congress are, who his close associates are.
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:19.480]  Reporters came out recently that a number of lawmakers, I believe eight and counting
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:23.480]  have been funded or have received funds from George Soros, for example.
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:30.480]  So all of that said, I think that Trump is perhaps in one of the most critical positions
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:35.480]  where he's going to have to be a lot smarter, his tactics a lot more incisive against the enemies
[2:25:35.480 --> 2:25:38.480]  that are coming against him and I think he's doing just that.
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:45.480]  So I think that what we're seeing here is a very, very well-gained up plan by Trump and his advisors.
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:49.480]  I've got to say, and I don't just have to be gushing because I almost don't want to be gushing,
[2:25:49.480 --> 2:25:53.480]  to be honest, Trump is ridiculously good and ridiculously smart.
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:57.480]  I mean, this is a godsend and I don't want your take on that,
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:25:59.480]  but I want to get Chris' take on that.
[2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:04.480]  Chris, I mean, all, if you look what he's actually doing, all he's doing is trying to flood the people
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:09.480]  with prosperity and trying to secure our nation and I just, it's so good, I can't believe it,
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:13.480]  and it actually brings tears to my eyes to see all these ignorant people telling lies
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:18.480]  when all he's trying to do is help him and then to see the media trying to promote killing him.
[2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:22.480]  Man, I'm wondering what happens if they do kill Trump? Go ahead, Chris.
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:27.480]  That's why it's more important for him to do this transparency thing that he's doing.
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:31.480]  You notice that everything he's doing, he's showing us what he's doing, what's being done.
[2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:38.480]  I've never seen this before. I've never seen such transparency and I believe that shining that light on that transparency,
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:44.480]  that's what's giving him the protection as well as God and a lot of the info warriors and good patriots out there.
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:50.480]  And he's getting a lot of help now. I've never seen nobody go off over appointment of a number two at this CIA.
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:57.480]  What is that all about? And, you know, so Trump just got to stick with this trip and we'll be fine.
[2:26:57.480 --> 2:27:06.480]  I hope so, because I tell you, Doug, the epic time we're living in, I mean, just from an interesting perspective
[2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:11.480]  of what's going on happening, it's so incredible how more happens in a day than used to happen in a year.
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:14.480]  What would you call this time around right now?
[2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:20.480]  Biblical. In a word, biblical. I think epic is correct as well.
[2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:22.480]  I think biblical is better. You're right.
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:28.480]  But I think we're also seeing after eight years of do nothing, say nothing, nothing gets done.
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:35.480]  I think we're seeing a cultural, social and spiritual whiplash that occurs when all of a sudden you have somebody get in office
[2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:41.480]  and says, OK, I'm going to do exactly what I said I'm going to do and show the American people that.
[2:27:41.480 --> 2:27:45.480]  And that, of course, is a shock to many people that, hey, there's stuff getting done.
[2:27:45.480 --> 2:27:53.480]  So biblical epic and definitely it's great to see some things getting done.
[2:27:53.480 --> 2:27:55.480]  That's right. That's right.
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:58.480]  Donald in Michigan. Go ahead. You're on the other one. Come back with the news.
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:03.480]  We're talking about how they're trying to plunge stocks publicly. I mean, talk about nasty.
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:06.480]  Donald, what do you think is happening?
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:11.480]  I think it's just a simple feeble attempt to inhibit growth by destroying investors
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:14.480]  from involving themselves in the betterment of the U.S. infrastructure.
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:18.480]  It's pretty simple. Like they just trying to do anything they can to determine.
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:23.480]  I agree. It's called sabotage and how do they announce sabotage
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:26.480]  and then think they won't get blamed if they're successful?
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:30.480]  People are educated enough to do their own research. It's pretty basic.
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:33.480]  I've had enough people under hypnotic spell on them.
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:36.480]  I agree. Let me just show new TV viewers some of these articles.
[2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:39.480]  I think that we're just making this up while you and Doug talk.
[2:28:39.480 --> 2:28:42.480]  Goldman Sachs says Trump rally has been curbed.
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:46.480]  Goldman Sachs economists are starting to worry about Trump president.
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:49.480]  Time to sell the dollar on erratic Trump policy. J.P. Morgan.
[2:28:49.480 --> 2:28:53.480]  Treasuries, gold rise, U.S. stock slip with oil market wrap.
[2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:56.480]  They're really trying to raise interest rates on Trump right now.
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:28:58.480]  What do you think this goes, Donald?
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:29:03.480]  It's just they're doing the best they can to shut down any avenue of growth
[2:29:03.480 --> 2:29:07.480]  that Trump has to offer. And I'm not 100% even for any candidate,
[2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:11.480]  but I'm definitely 100% against this info.
[2:29:11.480 --> 2:29:14.480]  Absolutely. This is sick.
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:15.480]  Alright, thank you. God bless, Donald.
[2:29:15.480 --> 2:29:17.480]  Alright, now I'm going to come back with the big news.
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:21.480]  Give Doug the floor here to recap what happened with so-called PizzaGate.
[2:29:21.480 --> 2:29:25.480]  It's not fair in America. If I put PizzaGate in the headline, it won't.
[2:29:25.480 --> 2:29:28.480]  It'll be delisted by YouTube. It'll be on our channel,
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:31.480]  but it can't get on any list as it climbs.
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:34.480]  Like Joe Rogan has the record podcast he's ever had.
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:37.480]  Didn't show up anywhere on iTunes or YouTube. It's blocked.
[2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:39.480]  You have to go find the actual link to even get it.
[2:29:39.480 --> 2:29:42.480]  It should be in all the best of top feeds and get 50 million views.
[2:29:42.480 --> 2:29:44.480]  But it's still number one. You still got beat.
[2:29:44.480 --> 2:29:56.480]  I'll be back.
[2:30:15.480 --> 2:30:18.480]  We brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2,
[2:30:18.480 --> 2:30:20.480]  SuperMail Vitality and so many others,
[2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:24.480]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process
[2:30:24.480 --> 2:30:26.480]  designed for maximized effects.
[2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:30.480]  This formula is the platinum standard of multi-vitamin mineral products,
[2:30:30.480 --> 2:30:32.480]  and this part is most important.
[2:30:32.480 --> 2:30:37.480]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived
[2:30:37.480 --> 2:30:39.480]  or of the highest quality lab standard.
[2:30:39.480 --> 2:30:42.480]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[2:30:42.480 --> 2:30:45.480]  And rest-secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the info war.
[2:30:45.480 --> 2:30:48.480]  That's infowarslives.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:30:48.480 --> 2:30:51.480]  Take action now before we sell out.
[2:30:51.480 --> 2:30:53.480]  I'm a truck driver from Missouri.
[2:30:53.480 --> 2:30:55.480]  For 13 hours a night, I sit in my truck and I drive.
[2:30:55.480 --> 2:30:57.480]  On a boredom, I'll stop and eat.
[2:30:57.480 --> 2:31:01.480]  If I'm not doing fast food, I guarantee there's a bag of chips open on my dashboard.
[2:31:01.480 --> 2:31:04.480]  That was all until Andro 400. I started out four months ago,
[2:31:04.480 --> 2:31:07.480]  and since taking Andro 400, I have dropped 45 pounds.
[2:31:07.480 --> 2:31:09.480]  I'm sleeping better. There's no cravings.
[2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:11.480]  I actually don't even think about food.
[2:31:11.480 --> 2:31:14.480]  My knee pain went away. I've had some lower back issues,
[2:31:14.480 --> 2:31:16.480]  and I've noticed that that went away,
[2:31:16.480 --> 2:31:19.480]  and I can only contribute that to Andro 400.
[2:31:19.480 --> 2:31:22.480]  One thing that Andro 400 said on the radio ad is it attacks belly fat.
[2:31:22.480 --> 2:31:24.480]  Well, let me tell you it did.
[2:31:24.480 --> 2:31:29.480]  The second month is where I saw a drastic change in the size of my stomach.
[2:31:29.480 --> 2:31:32.480]  I've lost six inches. This product really does work.
[2:31:32.480 --> 2:31:35.480]  So guys, if you'd like to experience similar results,
[2:31:35.480 --> 2:31:41.480]  then get Andro 400, the safe, natural and inexpensive way to boost your testosterone.

[2:31:54.480 --> 2:31:56.480]  feeling better than you have in years,
[2:31:56.480 --> 2:31:58.480]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,
[2:31:58.480 --> 2:32:01.480]  blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:04.480]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives,
[2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:05.480]  and you could be one of them.
[2:32:05.480 --> 2:32:07.480]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[2:32:07.480 --> 2:32:10.480]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract,
[2:32:10.480 --> 2:32:13.480]  talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[2:32:13.480 --> 2:32:16.480]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract
[2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:20.480]  is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids,
[2:32:20.480 --> 2:32:23.480]  enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[2:32:23.480 --> 2:32:26.480]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure,
[2:32:26.480 --> 2:32:29.480]  balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[2:32:29.480 --> 2:32:33.480]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[2:32:33.480 --> 2:32:36.480]  So if the body is an amazing thing, it simply needs some help
[2:32:36.480 --> 2:32:38.480]  so it has the tools to heal itself.
[2:32:38.480 --> 2:32:40.480]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[2:33:11.480 --> 2:33:15.480]  We are now only 17 days into the Trump presidency.
[2:33:15.480 --> 2:33:18.480]  And Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, everybody else have announced
[2:33:18.480 --> 2:33:22.480]  they want to implode the economy to try to discredit Trump
[2:33:22.480 --> 2:33:25.480]  and bring him down.
[2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:28.480]  Remember, with Briggs at the EU openly said,
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:30.480]  we will destroy your stock market.
[2:33:30.480 --> 2:33:32.480]  We will make you poor.
[2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:37.480]  You will let our unelected bureaucracy run you.
[2:33:37.480 --> 2:33:40.480]  Just like Hitler bombed England trying to make them surrender,
[2:33:40.480 --> 2:33:44.480]  I don't think that's going to work too well.
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:46.480]  Wow, what a time to be alive.
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:48.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got so much I want to do with reporters
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:51.480]  and crew and amazing people we've found to join the team
[2:33:51.480 --> 2:33:53.480]  to really change the world.
[2:33:53.480 --> 2:33:56.480]  You think info wars, thanks to your support's already gone far?
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:00.480]  We've only gotten to the platform level we need
[2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:03.480]  to really dominate the globalist.
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:07.480]  I want in the arena with their biggest systems.
[2:34:07.480 --> 2:34:09.480]  And I am in the arena.
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:13.480]  I'm hurting them bad, but I want to crush them.
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:16.480]  And I'm ready.
[2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:17.480]  It's my duty.
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:19.480]  I don't want to say I'm not afraid.
[2:34:19.480 --> 2:34:20.480]  It's beyond that.
[2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:21.480]  It's got to be done.
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:23.480]  I will take them on.
[2:34:23.480 --> 2:34:25.480]  And we finally have the skills, the understanding.
[2:34:25.480 --> 2:34:27.480]  We've been through the trials.
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:30.480]  We're now at the skill level to go to the next level.
[2:34:30.480 --> 2:34:33.480]  And I say that very humbly.
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:36.480]  We carry the light in the dark of the night.
[2:34:36.480 --> 2:34:38.480]  We're ready to set those brush fires everywhere

[2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:19.480]  but a major intelligence agency called up and said,
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:24.480]  does that really stop even pistol rounds through rifles?
[2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:27.480]  And as they did know, the Pentagon's been using it
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:29.480]  and state police have been using it.
[2:36:29.480 --> 2:36:30.480]  We're like, yeah, no, it's real.
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:32.480]  I mean, it's that crazy developed
[2:36:32.480 --> 2:36:35.480]  and taxes made right here in the USA.
[2:36:35.480 --> 2:36:37.480]  We get the exclusive to civilians first
[2:36:37.480 --> 2:36:41.480]  because we have patriots inside these laboratories.
[2:36:41.480 --> 2:36:44.480]  So this comes out on one of the big defense laboratories.
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:45.480]  Developed the University of Texas.

[2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:52.480]  Secret Service says, hey,

[2:36:55.480 --> 2:36:57.480]  when I'm at the RNC in Cleveland.

[2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:03.480]  All right, we're ready to meet with you at a disclosed location.
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:05.480]  Hillary Clinton's falling down all the time.
[2:37:05.480 --> 2:37:07.480]  She's having seizures every 25, 30 minutes.
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:10.480]  She's having to go into medical tents all the time.
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:12.480]  They tend to get her to go into one before
[2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:15.480]  or usher into one after.
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:17.480]  Millie Weaver and her team caught Hillary
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:19.480]  for 45 minutes inside of medical tent
[2:37:19.480 --> 2:37:21.480]  with emergency stretchers.
[2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:23.480]  Five days later, she collapses in New York.
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:24.480]  It's caught on tape.
[2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:26.480]  I mean, we have real sources.
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:28.480]  And I don't, I say this, everybody knows that.
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:31.480]  He told you about Benghazi and everything first.
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:36.480]  But Doug Hagman from his sources confirmed
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:39.480]  that they were looking at not just political stuff
[2:37:39.480 --> 2:37:43.480]  and not just, you know, the sell out to foreign governments
[2:37:43.480 --> 2:37:49.480]  on the foundation with her husband.
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:52.480]  You know, that's Hillary's girlfriend's husband, Wiener.
[2:37:52.480 --> 2:37:55.480]  They weren't just looking at that at Uma Abedin.
[2:37:55.480 --> 2:37:58.480]  They were looking at child porn pictures.
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:02.480]  And so before it was ever even in the news
[2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:05.480]  or even rumored, we broke it.
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:07.480]  That's New York, not some pizza place.
[2:38:07.480 --> 2:38:11.480]  David Brock's boyfriend is a diversion.
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:14.480]  And so now that's come out and pedophile networks
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:15.480]  are getting arrested.
[2:38:15.480 --> 2:38:19.480]  474 in LA alone, hundreds all over the country.
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:20.480]  This is a big deal.
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:21.480]  And this is their control arm.
[2:38:21.480 --> 2:38:24.480]  So I want to have Doug Hagman, who's a humble guy,
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:25.480]  take the floor.
[2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:27.480]  I'll interrupt you in five seconds.
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:29.480]  I'll just write notes here while you're talking.
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:31.480]  Lay out the history of this, what you think they did with
[2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:33.480]  PizzaGate, where this is going, and what these
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:34.480]  new developments are.
[2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:36.480]  And what we were told, you were told nice separately,
[2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:40.480]  just be cool, wait till Trump gets in, you'll see action.
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:41.480]  We're starting to see it.
[2:38:41.480 --> 2:38:43.480]  The question is, what's coming next?
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:45.480]  And no wonder the bad guys are fighting so hard
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:47.480]  to remove Trump because, you know,
[2:38:47.480 --> 2:38:48.480]  Trump doesn't like pedophiles.
[2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:50.480]  He doesn't like people that grab kids out of the back
[2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:54.480]  of their yard and take them to slave dungeons.
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:56.480]  No, you're exactly right, Alex.
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:38:58.480]  Just to kind of set the stage a little bit,
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:02.480]  just so people understand, in terms of the systemic issue,
[2:39:02.480 --> 2:39:05.480]  the systemic problem with respect to pedophilia inside
[2:39:05.480 --> 2:39:09.480]  and outside of the beltway, right now the ICMEC,
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:12.480]  which is the International Center for Missing Children,
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:15.480]  estimates that 8 million children are reported missing
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:17.480]  every year around the world.
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:20.480]  And of that number, an estimated 800,000 children
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:22.480]  will go missing here in the United States.
[2:39:22.480 --> 2:39:26.480]  And that's at a rate, by the way,
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:29.480]  of over 2,000 missing children each day.
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:31.480]  That just is mind-blowing.
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:37.480]  However, there's 466,950 odd cases
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:40.480]  are entered into the NCIC or the FBI's
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:44.480]  National Crime Information Center on an annual basis.
[2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:46.480]  Now, having said all of that, that kind of lays out
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:48.480]  the groundwork of what we're dealing with.
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:54.480]  Now, advance, of course, advance to October 3rd of last year,
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:58.480]  there was a document dump on WikiLeaks, the Podesta emails,
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:40:03.480]  and I think there were several email dumps.
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:05.480]  Investors and journalists and investigators
[2:40:05.480 --> 2:40:09.480]  had caught with some interesting terminology
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:13.480]  that had already been on the FBI watch list
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:16.480]  in terms of, well, code words used by pedophiles.
[2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:18.480]  And if I can just interject something here,
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:20.480]  just to be clear, I think you handled
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:23.480]  that whole pizza gate, whole issue very eloquently
[2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:26.480]  when you pulled back with respect to pizza gate,
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:28.480]  because this is not just pizza gate.
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:32.480]  This is the currency.
[2:40:32.480 --> 2:40:35.480]  Children are the currency, unfortunately.
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:40.480]  And human trafficking is the currency of the globalists.
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:42.480]  It's the currency of the religion.
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:44.480]  Yes, both.
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:51.480]  It's a spiritual crime, but it's also one of, well,
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:53.480]  it's just horrific.
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:55.480]  But having said all of that, just to bring it back
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:58.480]  to where we were when we spoke,
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:01.480]  of course, the Podesta email leaks had suggested
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:05.480]  some sort of code that was going on within the email,
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:07.480]  within the emails.
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:10.480]  And having said all of that, yeah, excuse me, that's my...
[2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:12.480]  We love it. We love dogs.
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:15.480]  That's actually a ringtone.
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:24.480]  Anyway, so once the Podesta emails had been exposed,
[2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:26.480]  the citizen journalists said, wait a minute,
[2:41:26.480 --> 2:41:29.480]  there's something here, and as they began to investigate,
[2:41:29.480 --> 2:41:33.480]  they began to connect some dots between John and Tony Podesta,
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:36.480]  for example, the old friends of Jeffrey Epstein,
[2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:39.480]  Dennis Hastert, and Clement Freud.
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:42.480]  And then that expanded into the Clinton Foundation,
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:44.480]  and it just kept going and going and going.
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:47.480]  And it suddenly developed James Alafantis,
[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:50.480]  who is the former lover of David Brock,
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:53.480]  and David Brock, of course, media matters for America
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:55.480]  and other NGOs and nonprofits.
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:58.480]  That's how that whole pizza gate aspect got kind of involved in this.
[2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:00.480]  And then that guy tied into Haiti,
[2:42:00.480 --> 2:42:02.480]  and a lady that got busted shipping a bunch of kids in
[2:42:02.480 --> 2:42:03.480]  and on and on and on.
[2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:06.480]  And that's his brother in the Washington Post saying,
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:09.480]  I've got deviant art of naked kids with their butts paddled
[2:42:09.480 --> 2:42:12.480]  and just weirder and weirder and rock bands at the pizza place
[2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:14.480]  saying our preference is children.
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:17.480]  And just, it's like, what the hell's going on here?
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:19.480]  Oh, yeah, yeah, it's ridiculous.
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:21.480]  So we have all of that.
[2:42:21.480 --> 2:42:24.480]  And then, of course, at the same time,
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:27.480]  you had the server scandal going on,
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:29.480]  or the server investigation,
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:35.480]  and the FBI going to Huma Abedin's now ex-husband,
[2:42:35.480 --> 2:42:38.480]  Anthony Weiner or whatever at the time,
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:41.480]  her husband, and saying, wait,
[2:42:41.480 --> 2:42:43.480]  there's all kinds of classified documents here,
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:48.480]  over 650,000 classified documents on the computers
[2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:51.480]  at the Weiner slash Abedin household.
[2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:55.480]  So, all right, so you've got that,
[2:42:55.480 --> 2:42:59.480]  and that kind of overlapped into the sexting,
[2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:00.480]  or depending how you look at it,
[2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:03.480]  the sexting with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina
[2:43:03.480 --> 2:43:07.480]  overlapped into the FBI investigation of the secured files,
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:11.480]  the top secret classified files on the unauthorized laptop.
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:14.480]  And that kind of dragged Hillary into this as well,
[2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:17.480]  because some of the emails of Hillary's
[2:43:17.480 --> 2:43:20.480]  were found on that laptop, of course.
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:22.480]  But it's more than a laptop, it's a desktop,
[2:43:22.480 --> 2:43:24.480]  it's thumb drives, it's a modem.
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:28.480]  Trust me when I tell you, there's a lot of pieces to this
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:30.480]  focused around Weiner.
[2:43:30.480 --> 2:43:33.480]  It's a whole enterprise of her selling data.
[2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:35.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:37.480]  So then you've got this task force
[2:43:37.480 --> 2:43:40.480]  that's investigating the child sexting,
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:42.480]  this child porn thing with Weiner.
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:44.480]  And then, of course, you have the FBI
[2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:46.480]  and the other investigators,
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:49.480]  the federal investigators focused on the secret documents
[2:43:49.480 --> 2:43:51.480]  or the classified documents.
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:54.480]  So there was this kind of a push-and-pull fight
[2:43:54.480 --> 2:43:57.480]  that took place in real time,
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:00.480]  and according to my sources, in real life,
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:02.480]  between investigators.
[2:44:02.480 --> 2:44:05.480]  Well, all right, just to give you some idea,
[2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:09.480]  I do have information that the task force
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:14.480]  assigned to the sexting scandal of Anthony Weiner
[2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:21.480]  made insurance copies of some of the documents,
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:24.480]  if not all of the documents that were found on the laptop.
[2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:27.480]  So there's that. There's documents, reportedly,
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:32.480]  that are in the custody of some very moral,
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:35.480]  upright people that belong or that were resident
[2:44:35.480 --> 2:44:38.480]  on the computers owned by Weiner.
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:41.480]  And I'm not talking about the classified stuff.
[2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:43.480]  I'm talking about the sexting stuff.
[2:44:43.480 --> 2:44:44.480]  The pervert stuff.
[2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:45.480]  Yeah, all right.
[2:44:45.480 --> 2:44:49.480]  So having said all of that,
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:52.480]  the task force itself said,
[2:44:52.480 --> 2:44:54.480]  okay, we need to do something.
[2:44:54.480 --> 2:44:55.480]  We need to move on this.
[2:44:55.480 --> 2:44:58.480]  There was pushback by the Fed, by the FBI, by the feds.
[2:44:58.480 --> 2:45:02.480]  And what happened was the Comey was kind of caught in the middle.
[2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:06.480]  As much as I, well, Comey was caught in the middle of this.
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:07.480]  He had to act.
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:09.480]  So I think part of his decision to come out
[2:45:09.480 --> 2:45:11.480]  right before the election had to do with it.
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:13.480]  And that's what I was told by other sources.
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:15.480]  That's why he had to go back and forth,
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:17.480]  because he didn't want to look like either way,
[2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:19.480]  but he still had to do his duty.
[2:45:19.480 --> 2:45:20.480]  And so now Trump knows that.
[2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:22.480]  That's why he's basically retaining.
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:23.480]  Exactly.
[2:45:23.480 --> 2:45:25.480]  And you're right on the money with your sources.
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:26.480]  So here we are.
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:30.480]  And people are saying, well, what about all of this?
[2:45:30.480 --> 2:45:32.480]  If this really truly did exist,
[2:45:32.480 --> 2:45:34.480]  then there would be people doing things about it.
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:36.480]  There'd be a rest being made.
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:38.480]  Well, true.
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:42.480]  However, there's an issue with the Justice Department,
[2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:43.480]  the Department of Justice.
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:45.480]  What do you do without an attorney general?
[2:45:45.480 --> 2:45:48.480]  What do you do with a very antagonistic group?
[2:45:48.480 --> 2:45:50.480]  Well, it's clear. There's a civil war going on.
[2:45:50.480 --> 2:45:52.480]  That's why they're battling everything Trump's doing,
[2:45:52.480 --> 2:45:54.480]  trying to keep him getting in position.
[2:45:54.480 --> 2:45:55.480]  Right.
[2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:57.480]  And by the way, that's why I believe,
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:45:59.480]  and based on information I received,
[2:45:59.480 --> 2:46:03.480]  that the prosecutor, Preet Bahara,
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:05.480]  in the southern district of New York,
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:08.480]  was retained because he has some information about this,
[2:46:08.480 --> 2:46:11.480]  and he intends to go forward.
[2:46:11.480 --> 2:46:12.480]  No, exactly.
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:14.480]  And let's say the Death Star is the good guys,
[2:46:14.480 --> 2:46:15.480]  not the bad guys in this.
[2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:18.480]  The Death Star is going to clear the planet to fire.
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:20.480]  They've already launched their X-Wings to blow up Trump
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:22.480]  before he can get clear to fire.
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:23.480]  And it's just like the movie,
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:25.480]  but Luke Skywalker's the bad guy in this one.
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:27.480]  We're trying to get clear to fire on him,
[2:46:27.480 --> 2:46:29.480]  but the president's not clear to fire yet.
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:31.480]  But I heard from little birds that this would happen
[2:46:31.480 --> 2:46:32.480]  about two weeks ago.
[2:46:32.480 --> 2:46:34.480]  It started rolling up other networks
[2:46:34.480 --> 2:46:36.480]  to put pressure on their California network,
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:39.480]  their Pennsylvania network, their Florida network,
[2:46:39.480 --> 2:46:41.480]  so that they are totally panicked,
[2:46:41.480 --> 2:46:44.480]  even if they're able to destroy all the evidence in this area,
[2:46:44.480 --> 2:46:46.480]  that we would see the bust of again.
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:49.480]  We're seeing unprecedented child porn bust right now
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:51.480]  of not just child porn, but the actual sex slaves.
[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:53.480]  So do you have any intel on that?
[2:46:53.480 --> 2:46:56.480]  Yeah, well, and I think one of the artifacts
[2:46:56.480 --> 2:47:00.480]  or one of the consequences from the take
[2:47:00.480 --> 2:47:05.480]  from the Wiener slash Abedin slash Clinton emails
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:11.480]  was the 474 arrests made in Los Angeles County.
[2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:14.480]  55 victims were rescued, as a matter of fact,
[2:47:14.480 --> 2:47:18.480]  in this massive Southern California child trafficking network
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:21.480]  dubbed Operation Reclaim and Rebuild.
[2:47:21.480 --> 2:47:24.480]  But there are other key issues here or key cases that...
[2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:26.480]  And notice the Trumpian language,
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:28.480]  reclaim America, rebuild America.
[2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:29.480]  Yeah.
[2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:30.480]  Starting with our children.
[2:47:30.480 --> 2:47:31.480]  Exactly.
[2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:32.480]  And I...
[2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:35.480]  Reclaim it from the pedophiles, rebuild morals.
[2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:36.480]  Exactly, yeah.
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:38.480]  And that involved more than 30 federal,
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:40.480]  state and local law enforcement agencies.
[2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:44.480]  And I was going to mention that great pickup on that.
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:46.480]  And of course, we saw the Bucks County, Pennsylvania,
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:49.480]  arrest here that made the news back at the end of January.
[2:47:49.480 --> 2:47:51.480]  And I'm told there's a lot not making the news.
[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:54.480]  I'm told some people are so bad that it's just bye-bye.
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:56.480]  Yeah, there was a Long Island priest
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:47:59.480]  that was just arrested here this past,
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:01.480]  well, it was about a week ago.
[2:48:01.480 --> 2:48:06.480]  Christopher King, the priest with the St. James Episcopal Church
[2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:07.480]  in Long Beach, New York.
[2:48:07.480 --> 2:48:08.480]  But there was also a case...
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:10.480]  And again, that's getting people to talk, right?
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:13.480]  That's rolling up their procurers, correct?
[2:48:13.480 --> 2:48:14.480]  Yeah, low-hanging fruit.
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:16.480]  And that's kind of...
[2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:20.480]  If they can't or would somehow be disallowed,
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:24.480]  or if things didn't go properly with respect to the evidence
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:25.480]  that they did have.
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:28.480]  And this is one of the things I ran into as an investigator.
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:31.480]  Sometimes you might get a piece of evidence that you can't use because...
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:33.480]  I should add, you've written books a decade ago
[2:48:33.480 --> 2:48:35.480]  on satanic ritual abuse and justice stuff.
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:37.480]  Plus, you're a leading expert on this.
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:42.480]  Well, yeah, Russ Dizdar, for example, who's an associate,
[2:48:42.480 --> 2:48:46.480]  he's really informative in terms of the satanic ritual abuse of this.
[2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:48.480]  In fact, my book, Save My Blood,
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:50.480]  I had no idea what I was into back in the mid-80s
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:52.480]  when I was investigating the murder of my uncle.
[2:48:52.480 --> 2:48:55.480]  And a parallel investigation with respect to satanic ritual abuse
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:57.480]  I stumbled into.
[2:48:57.480 --> 2:48:59.480]  And that's what my book, Save My Blood, is about.
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:00.480]  But having said all of that,
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:02.480]  we're seeing the real-life case come forward here
[2:49:02.480 --> 2:49:05.480]  with the systematic pedophilia of satanic ritual abuse
[2:49:05.480 --> 2:49:09.480]  taking place in the United States with respect to
[2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:12.480]  PCA and the emails.
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:13.480]  And this is not how it works, though.
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:14.480]  You have a good heart, you love God,
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:16.480]  you're nobody's perfect, but you're not a pedophile,
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:17.480]  I'm not either.
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:18.480]  We love God, we want justice.
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:20.480]  You're off just doing good, not backing down,
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:22.480]  and you break through a wall and it's like,
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:23.480]  what the...
[2:49:23.480 --> 2:49:24.480]  What?
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:25.480]  You know, that's how my life is.
[2:49:25.480 --> 2:49:27.480]  It's like, it's that bad?
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:28.480]  Yeah.
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:30.480]  Yeah, it's...
[2:49:30.480 --> 2:49:31.480]  And this is something...
[2:49:31.480 --> 2:49:34.480]  I mean, a lot of times we stumble into it,
[2:49:34.480 --> 2:49:37.480]  we stumble into it, but we're there for a purpose,
[2:49:37.480 --> 2:49:38.480]  I believe.
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:39.480]  And I think we've done...
[2:49:39.480 --> 2:49:41.480]  You've done a tremendous job, by the way.
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:42.480]  Your sources are 100% accurate,
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:43.480]  but you've got to be in that position.
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:46.480]  We have to play our positions and be in position
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:48.480]  for the sources to give us information
[2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:49.480]  and to make a difference.
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:51.480]  And to never burn those sources.
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:53.480]  Oh, exactly.
[2:49:53.480 --> 2:49:55.480]  Do it once, and you might as well just
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:49:57.480]  fold up shop and go home,
[2:49:57.480 --> 2:50:00.480]  because you're not going to be trusted by anyone again.
[2:50:00.480 --> 2:50:01.480]  I know.
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:03.480]  Some of the stuff I know I wish I could talk about.
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:05.480]  I feel bad not saying some of this stuff,
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:07.480]  but then I understand.
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:09.480]  Like, we've had people jump the gun on announcements before,
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:11.480]  and then it blows up a whole operation.
[2:50:11.480 --> 2:50:13.480]  And all I'm saying is there are really good people
[2:50:13.480 --> 2:50:15.480]  in the government dedicated.
[2:50:15.480 --> 2:50:17.480]  Some of the worst people are in the government,
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:19.480]  some of the best are in the government.
[2:50:19.480 --> 2:50:22.480]  And this is quite a time to be alive, isn't it, Doug?
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:25.480]  Oh, yeah, indeed it is.
[2:50:25.480 --> 2:50:28.480]  We are looking, I believe, at a time...
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:31.480]  Well, a time like no other, but we have to do...
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:33.480]  We have to play our positions.
[2:50:33.480 --> 2:50:35.480]  And I just admire what you do.
[2:50:35.480 --> 2:50:36.480]  Oh, I admire you.
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:38.480]  It's just good to be in this together,
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:40.480]  fighting a bunch of child-raping devils.
[2:50:40.480 --> 2:50:42.480]  And again, folks, we're not child-raping devils,
[2:50:42.480 --> 2:50:43.480]  so we don't believe it.
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:45.480]  I don't believe it either, except it's really happening.
[2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:46.480]  It's like, what?
[2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:48.480]  People kidnap kids and torture them?
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:50.480]  Yeah, folks, they do.
[2:50:50.480 --> 2:51:12.480]  By now, you know that wireless technology, like cell phones,
[2:51:12.480 --> 2:51:34.480]  will rotate.
[2:51:34.480 --> 2:51:39.120]  Alan Laudinger takes a look at how the law of attraction really works and how it is being

[2:53:52.240 --> 2:53:58.720]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[2:53:58.720 --> 2:54:04.720]  a war on for your mind.
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:16.800]  All right, I'm going to be out here five after and then David Knight's going to take over. He's
[2:54:16.800 --> 2:54:21.760]  got a lot to cover. He's going to play some excerpts from Trump's latest speech at Centcom.
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:26.320]  I know we've got a lot of great callers too. Matt, let's talk about the economic collapse,
[2:54:26.320 --> 2:54:33.040]  a judge blocking executive branch, sorrow, son, reinstate military officers that Obama
[2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:37.040]  snubbed. Maybe I'll take a few of these calls in the next segment, but I got to let Hagman go
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:42.720]  his website where you can find out about his show and more. It's HagmanReport.com does his own
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:48.000]  daily broadcast, such an asset to have him. And he's so on target with what he says
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:52.320]  he threw Hagman 10 years ago. They're bringing in jihad. He's letting them build training camps.
[2:54:52.320 --> 2:54:56.480]  There's a plan to flood Europe later and bring in a caliphate. I'm like, that guy's fair mongering.
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:54:59.280]  But then most of what he said, it was true. So I was like, wow, I better get him on.
[2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:02.960]  And then now it's all come true. But it's just like, again, we don't think like that.
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:08.720]  You know, I feel guilty if I drink the last milk out of the jug at night knowing my kids will
[2:55:08.720 --> 2:55:12.880]  want it in the morning or, you know, or if I don't do the laundry and I'm lazy and, you know,
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:17.760]  let the family do it or, you know what I mean? Or I'll let the garage get dirty. I just, I'm
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:22.960]  wracked with not even guilt like conscience. And then meanwhile, I mean, I just, it's so alien to
[2:55:22.960 --> 2:55:27.760]  me to kidnap kids and rape them or kill them. But this is going on historically. It's a fact.
[2:55:27.760 --> 2:55:31.520]  And look at the Catholic church and look at Penn State and look at Boys Town and look at
[2:55:31.520 --> 2:55:35.760]  all of it. It just keeps coming out. There is this cult. So in the last four minutes,
[2:55:35.760 --> 2:55:39.360]  other key points, Doug Hagman, about where all this is going, what your intel's telling you?
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:44.960]  Well, one kind of a side note or a footnote in this, it's rather interesting as I was looking at the
[2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:50.160]  anti-Trump protests, the Women's March. And I just, I may have mentioned this, but I want to
[2:55:50.160 --> 2:55:56.800]  just reiterate this. It's interesting because those who preach the inclusiveness and tolerance
[2:55:56.800 --> 2:56:02.080]  like the women's people that sponsor the Women's March, I found it very interesting that in addition
[2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:07.680]  to Linda Sinsauer, who wants to, one of the co-founders of the Women's March, who wants to
[2:56:07.680 --> 2:56:14.080]  make sure we end in the United States, the overlap between the perversity of people in the government
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:18.640]  and outside of the government and those that are pushing these demonstrations for example.
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:22.400]  Extreme Islam is very perverse and satanic, so it meshes together.
[2:56:23.040 --> 2:56:30.960]  Yeah. Well, in fact, sharing the dias with Linda Sinsauer, it was Donna Hilton.
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:35.520]  And come to find out, she served a number of years, two decades in prison.
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:38.000]  For kidnapping.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:39.680]  For kidnapping, right, right. So you've got that.
[2:56:39.680 --> 2:56:41.760]  Didn't they kill him too, didn't they?
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:46.480]  Oh, yeah. It's horrible. That's what I mean. No, it's not like one of the women leaders is
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:52.480]  like that. They're like all bank robbing, killing, sharia. They write books about sexual mutilation.
[2:56:52.480 --> 2:56:54.640]  They're just a bunch of crazy people.
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:58.640]  Yeah. And people, I really want people to understand, and you've done a great job
[2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:05.760]  pointing this out, the overlap between things like what is known as Pizzagate or the pedophilia,
[2:57:05.760 --> 2:57:14.320]  large-scale pedophilia, civil to DC and beyond, the overlap between that as well as the anti-Trump
[2:57:14.320 --> 2:57:18.400]  protests. These are some of the same people, the same fingerprints, the same tactics.
[2:57:18.400 --> 2:57:21.040]  And that's why they beat up women and other people in wheelchairs.
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:25.680]  Yeah, exactly. You're exactly right. So we have to look at, in my view, anyway,
[2:57:25.680 --> 2:57:31.760]  we have to look at the larger picture. And again, I just props for the way you handled.
[2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:34.320]  Oh, please stop it. Props to you, brother. We're all in this together.
[2:57:34.320 --> 2:57:42.880]  Yeah, but you know what? The way that this was playing out, boy, you were on some tenuous
[2:57:42.880 --> 2:57:46.800]  ground there with respect to Pizzagate. And I saw how you were getting roped in,
[2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:50.880]  and that was immediately taken care of. So that's a good job. But we have to keep looking,
[2:57:50.880 --> 2:57:56.720]  I think, in my view, at the bigger picture here. We have to keep our wits about us to make sure
[2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:02.640]  that Trump is, that we don't fall for any kind of, we don't get sucked into anything that would
[2:58:02.640 --> 2:58:06.960]  go. No, I agree. We've got to be as wise and serpents, as peaceful as Doves, as Moses said,
[2:58:06.960 --> 2:58:12.640]  and his pray for guidance, because I always try to go on my gut weeks before. I kind of let it
[2:58:12.640 --> 2:58:16.480]  run away with me with some of the crew. And then they're great, too. I just got to go with my gut.
[2:58:16.480 --> 2:58:20.400]  It was definitely set up. And now you see it coming out, though, what they didn't want to come out.
[2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:23.760]  So praise God for that, Doug Hagman. Look forward to having you back up very soon.
[2:58:23.760 --> 2:58:29.920]  Thank you so much, sir. Thank you, Alex. Wow. We'll be right back with the fourth hour. I'll
[2:58:29.920 --> 2:58:33.840]  introduce David Knight coming up. We've got a few phone calls first. Stay with us
[2:58:33.840 --> 2:58:36.640]  in fourwars.com. They don't like this broadcast, folks.
[2:58:40.880 --> 2:58:47.600]  President Donald Trump says negative polls are usually fake news. The president took to Twitter
[2:58:47.600 --> 2:58:54.080]  this morning to slam media coverage that cites negative polls. This, after CNN released one
[2:58:54.080 --> 2:59:00.160]  yesterday that claimed the majority of Americans oppose President Trump's executive order to
[2:59:00.160 --> 2:59:06.640]  temporarily ban refugees from failed state countries with ties to terrorism. Trump said on
[2:59:06.640 --> 2:59:13.200]  Twitter, any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN ABC NBC polls in the election.
[2:59:13.200 --> 2:59:19.040]  Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. Another poll, this time by CBS,
[2:59:19.040 --> 2:59:24.640]  claims that more than half of Americans disagree with Trump's travel restriction order. However,
[2:59:24.640 --> 2:59:30.160]  two polls released last week by Reuters and Rasmussen, not reported by the mainstream media,
[2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:36.400]  found the opposite. Those polls suggest that the majority of Americans strongly support Trump's
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:52.320]  order. You can learn more right now at infowars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:52.320 --> 3:00:09.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:15.680]  so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:15.680 --> 3:00:21.840]  Yep, never knew I'd grew up to be the head
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:30.800]  chief cook and bottle washer at one of the main resistance arms against a worldwide scientific
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:34.000]  tyranny. But here we are, I just want to let the listeners know it's all about you,
[3:00:34.720 --> 3:00:38.240]  all about you spreading the word, all about you praying for us, all about you buying the products,
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:42.960]  all about you starting your own shows, all about you taking action.
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:46.800]  All these other talk show hosts go, man, you have all these other talk show hosts on,
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:50.080]  you promote their books, even though a lot of times you're not selling them. What are you doing?
[3:00:50.080 --> 3:00:54.400]  I'm just trying to win. You understand? I don't care about who wins a football game.
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:00:58.720]  I knew Trump was a fan of the Patriots, but I didn't carry the way.
[3:01:01.040 --> 3:01:03.760]  And I didn't even get into that today, how they're saying it's white supremacism,
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:07.680]  because there's a few white, there's a few more white players. It's like the team's like more
[3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:13.680]  than half black and then you've got some Hispanic players and some white players and it looks like
[3:01:13.680 --> 3:01:17.680]  black guys making most of the touchdowns. I mean, yeah, it's a good quarterback and it's a good,
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:21.680]  good receiver. That's white guys and black guys working together. It's humans working together
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:28.160]  and the media said, man, that's racist. I mean, the articles are on info wars.com. How do you take
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:33.360]  that turn into something racist? But that's what they're doing to handicap everybody. So this
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:39.840]  country's a bunch of basket cases. But frankly, I can't even believe at this point.
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:47.440]  Because when you're informed, this stuff is so obvious. It's like I have eyesight and the general
[3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:52.800]  public that isn't awake is blind. And so I'm awake on this plane of existence. I have eyesight,
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:59.280]  I have touch, I have smell, I have mobility and I'm in this plane and I see the majority of people
[3:01:59.280 --> 3:02:04.000]  are like blind or they're halfway blind or, you know, they're, they're, and I'm trying to wake
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:09.680]  them up. So you have sight, you know, just take the goggles off. All of a sudden I hear somebody
[3:02:09.680 --> 3:02:13.520]  next to me who's got eyesight. Oh, hey, you can see, why don't you help them? And they go, I'm
[3:02:13.520 --> 3:02:19.120]  going to eat these people. I'm going to abuse them and enslave them as they don't have sight.
[3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:24.000]  Stop trying to give them sight. I'm like, I'm not giving them sight. They've got blinders on. I want
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:28.800]  to take them off. I, I got kids. I want them to be friends with their kids. Just feed on them.
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:33.120]  They don't want your help. Watch this. I'll just, I'll just take one's goggles off and say you're
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:38.480]  a bad guy. He's a bad guy. Then the guy attacks me. See, I told you, you don't want to give them sight.
[3:02:39.040 --> 3:02:43.840]  They're profane. They don't deserve the sight. You will be given the sight.
[3:02:45.920 --> 3:02:52.160]  But you didn't give me the sight. God did. And I tell you, it is metaphysical because in my life
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:58.960]  there's a lot of things that happened. I'll never tell anybody about because it's too heavy, but
[3:02:58.960 --> 3:03:03.760]  I will just tell you there's a lot going on this universe. It's not in these books and the elite
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:10.880]  know all this stuff. They know it and they don't want you to know. I mean, you're like a composite
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:15.520]  of all these people before you in this human journey and their genetics and it's been proven you
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:20.480]  have their instincts and many of their memories and you can access all of that and the enemy knows
[3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:28.240]  that. I had an article I'm going to get to today and I didn't get to it. How they've confirmed
[3:03:28.240 --> 3:03:33.840]  that trees have fungus networks and that trees communicate with trees hundreds of miles away
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:38.560]  through underground internet of things. And of course they show you that in the movie Avatar
[3:03:38.560 --> 3:03:42.880]  because this was done 50 years ago. But there is an internet of things between people
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:48.560]  and the globalists are trying to build an artificial system overall of that.
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:54.720]  And that's the BBC reporting that. What about ancestral memories?
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:00.640]  You know, you seem like a Vulcan mind melt.
[3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:04.400]  What do you think stuff like that comes from, huh?
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:10.400]  Can you imagine being a child and having the knowledge of an old man put into you?
[3:04:13.280 --> 3:04:18.080]  Now they call that the occult. No, the people that want to keep all that hidden, that's the occult.
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:22.000]  All this stuff should be known. And the media makes jokes about this when I talk about it,
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:25.920]  but you know what? They all are trying to find out about it. Well, that's what I know all about it.
[3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:32.480]  And I'm certainly not going to sit here and play games with people who are trying to suppress
[3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:36.720]  humanity. I want to empower humanity. Now, I got a loaded phone here, but I'm sorry I'm out of time.
[3:04:36.720 --> 3:04:40.080]  No pressure on David. If he wants to flush him, I understand that the great people,
[3:04:40.080 --> 3:04:44.240]  but he's had a lot to cover in a Trump speech to get to and a lot more. But David Knight is coming
[3:04:44.240 --> 3:04:48.960]  up here in just a moment. I'm Alex Jones, not only news tonight, 7 o'clock central in FullWars.com.
[3:05:14.320 --> 3:05:18.400]  Ted Malick's credentials read like the perfect resume of an elitist. In fact, he even wrote a
[3:05:18.400 --> 3:05:24.720]  biography titled Davos, Aspen and Yale, but it's a tagline that says it all. My life behind the
[3:05:24.720 --> 3:05:29.840]  curtains as a global sherpa. He knows globalism from the inside, having served as an expert to
[3:05:29.840 --> 3:05:35.040]  prepare summits, and he will serve them no more. But the UN is the center, the driving force of
[3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:39.680]  globalism. So why not put someone like Malick on point there rather than an establishment figure
[3:05:39.680 --> 3:05:44.800]  like Nikki Haley? If they can aid European nations and resting their sovereignty back from Brussels,
[3:05:44.800 --> 3:05:50.480]  Trump will have allies in the fight against the United Nations. Renfowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[3:05:50.480 --> 3:05:54.800]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the
[3:05:54.800 --> 3:06:00.240]  air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates of the chemicals
[3:06:00.240 --> 3:06:05.920]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that
[3:06:05.920 --> 3:06:11.440]  brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa

[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:27.440]  our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for
[3:06:27.440 --> 3:06:34.240]  themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.

[3:06:39.200 --> 3:06:44.000]  putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a

[3:08:10.080 --> 3:08:17.760]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host for this
[3:08:17.760 --> 3:08:22.320]  fourth hour. We're going to take a look at Donald Trump's speech at CENTCOM, and of course, the
[3:08:22.320 --> 3:08:26.480]  events that are the backdrop for that speech, the things that have been happening with Iran.
[3:08:27.040 --> 3:08:32.480]  We see an escalation in tensions, and of course, NPR comes out and says, well, let's take a look at
[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:37.120]  the exact language in the UN resolutions to try to give them some wiggle room, because it was
[3:08:37.120 --> 3:08:43.120]  UN who said that you will not do this, and then came back and said, we call on you not to do that,
[3:08:43.120 --> 3:08:47.840]  and they maintain that that gives them license to do that. We'll take a look at whether that does
[3:08:47.840 --> 3:08:52.320]  really give them license or not, and we're going to take a look at what Donald Trump says to the
[3:08:52.320 --> 3:08:57.440]  military. Of course, this is his first time visiting a military base as president, and so
[3:08:57.440 --> 3:09:04.320]  it's very important for us to take a look at what he said today, as well as what may be happening
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:08.160]  in the Middle East. But there's something else that I want to talk about, and you may have heard
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:15.680]  the one minute that we've been playing and cycle through the show about Ted Malick,
[3:09:15.680 --> 3:09:21.920]  and of course, he's a man who has been tipped to be Donald Trump's pick as ambassador to the
[3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:27.520]  European Union. As far as I can tell, it's not exactly official, but he is going everywhere
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:33.680]  and being interviewed by the BBC, by other European press, as if he is now the pick,
[3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:40.160]  and there's also a movement in the European Parliament trying to stop him from being picked,
[3:09:40.160 --> 3:09:44.160]  because they don't think that the U.S. ought to be allowed to have a say in that.
[3:09:44.160 --> 3:09:50.240]  This is the arrogance of these people. And remember that it was Herman von Rumpway,
[3:09:50.240 --> 3:09:56.240]  who was the first president of the European Union, that Nigel Farage said, who do you think you are?
[3:09:56.800 --> 3:10:00.800]  You have the demeanor of a third-rate bank clerk. Who do you think you are deposing
[3:10:00.800 --> 3:10:07.520]  the democratically elected leader of Greece and putting in a Goldman Sachs banker? Remember
[3:10:07.520 --> 3:10:15.680]  when they did that? He goes, at the very place where democracy began, you shut it down, the European
[3:10:15.680 --> 3:10:20.960]  Union. And so I want to take a quick look at some of the things that were said this last weekend in
[3:10:20.960 --> 3:10:28.080]  Europe by Ted Malick. Now, one of the things that you need to know about Ted Malick, again,
[3:10:28.080 --> 3:10:36.560]  it kind of says it in the title of his book Davos, Aspen, and Yale. My life behind the elite curtain
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:42.480]  as a global Sherpa. Now, he calls himself a Sherpa, not to say that, hey, I carried the
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:46.720]  baggage for these guys. I saw what happens behind the curtain. I'm not going to be their porter
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:54.720]  anymore. A Sherpa is really an executive that they have selected to essentially head a summit
[3:10:54.720 --> 3:11:00.320]  conference, say to play on words. Remember Sherpas are the people that they hire as guides,
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:05.120]  when they're going to go up the Himalayas, when they're going to climb a mountain, right? So
[3:11:05.120 --> 3:11:10.320]  when they're going to have a summit, and instead it's not Everest, but they're going to have a
[3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:14.720]  summit, then what they do is they hire a guy who is going to be the one who's going to walk them
[3:11:14.720 --> 3:11:21.520]  through. And so he's been a guy who has a very interesting history here. He's a former Yale
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:27.920]  professor. He's been a business executive. He has been a diplomat, a scholar diplomat,
[3:11:27.920 --> 3:11:33.760]  appointed by the U.S. State Department. And he also gave a one-to-one seminar for the chairman
[3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:40.160]  of Toyota. This guy is very intelligent. I would say he is our own Nigel Farage here in the United
[3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:46.080]  States. And he was not cowed down when the British press said, why would you even want to come here?
[3:11:46.080 --> 3:11:50.240]  You don't like the European Union. They said the same thing to Nigel Farage, didn't they? Why would
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:54.640]  you go there? You don't even like the European Union. And I was like, yeah, because we're going
[3:11:54.640 --> 3:12:02.080]  to push back against it. And it's interesting because you had the European Council President,
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:07.360]  so they understand the European Union has this massive bureaucracy. They have a President of
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:14.480]  the European Commission. That person is Jean-Claude Junker. They also have a European Council President
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:20.560]  who was kind of referred to as a President of the EU. Are you confused? Well, you're supposed to be
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:24.000]  because that's the whole point of bureaucracy. There's so many different presidents and so
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:28.400]  many different councils and committees that they want to shut this whole thing down by
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:31.520]  shifting. Oh, no, you're not talking to the right person. It's kind of like what happens
[3:12:31.520 --> 3:12:36.000]  when you go to the Department of Motor Vehicles. No, no, no, this isn't the person you need to
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:40.240]  talk to. You need to go down there, you know, no matter what happens. Okay, so you've got
[3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:45.040]  Jean-Claude Junker, who's President of the European Commission, Donald Tusk, who is a European Council
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:53.600]  President. Now Tusk is a former Prime Minister of Poland, and he actually said this. He said,
[3:12:53.600 --> 3:12:59.840]  Trump's US is among the external threats to the European Union along with China, Russia,
[3:12:59.840 --> 3:13:06.800]  and radical Islam. Do you understand that? They think that Donald Trump is a threat to Europe
[3:13:06.800 --> 3:13:14.240]  like radical Islam. These people are absolutely amazing. The people who bring in, open up their
[3:13:14.240 --> 3:13:19.120]  borders. And of course, they're doing that for other reasons. They're not doing that to provide
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:27.040]  safety for their citizens. See, their responsibility, first and foremost, should be to protect the
[3:13:27.040 --> 3:13:30.240]  safety of their citizens. That's why you have governments. They're there to protect your
[3:13:30.240 --> 3:13:37.040]  rights. They're there to protect your physical safety. And yet, they surrender that to these people
[3:13:37.040 --> 3:13:41.360]  coming in from other countries, putting the citizens of foreign countries over the citizens
[3:13:41.360 --> 3:13:48.240]  of their own country. As some people, I call me on that when I said that before on YouTube.
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:54.400]  I'm not saying that the government and its safety claims trump our liberty. No,
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:59.120]  government should first and foremost protect our liberty. I've said that many times. Anybody
[3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:03.280]  that says that doesn't really understand what I'm saying here. What I'm saying, though, is that the
[3:14:03.280 --> 3:14:10.160]  safety and security of foreign citizens does not trump the safety and security of those who are
[3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:14.800]  citizens of the country that they're supposed to be the government of. You understand? The American
[3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:19.680]  government should put the American citizens' safety above that of foreign citizens. That's
[3:14:19.680 --> 3:14:24.400]  what I'm saying here. And yet, of course, the German government doesn't do that. Why? Because
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:28.800]  they want to replace these citizens here. So when you look at some of the things that were
[3:14:28.800 --> 3:14:32.080]  said this last weekend, one of the most interesting things that he said was,
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:38.560]  Davos man is dead. That's what Ted Malick said. Now, what does that mean? Davos man is dead.
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:44.880]  Well, you may not know who Davos man is. Davos man is a term that they have used to refer to
[3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:51.280]  themselves, the Davos globalist elite. It refers to a global elite of wealthy,
[3:14:51.280 --> 3:14:55.440]  predominantly man whose members view themselves as completely international.
[3:14:55.440 --> 3:15:00.240]  They supposedly see their identity as a matter of personal choice and not an accident of birth.
[3:15:00.240 --> 3:15:06.160]  So they say, look, I'm going to choose to be an international man, a global man. I may have been
[3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:12.080]  born in America or Germany or Britain, but I don't really care about those countries. I'm
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:17.280]  transcending that. And according to a political scientist who coined that term, his name is Huntington,
[3:15:17.280 --> 3:15:22.320]  he said, quote, there are people who have little need for national loyalty. They view national
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:27.040]  boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing. They see national governments as
[3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:33.280]  residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite's global operations.
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:37.600]  Does that sound like George Soros? Does that sound like the people who run Davos? Of course,
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:43.920]  it does. They refer to them self-consciously as Davos man. See, Davos is their public face.
[3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:48.080]  And when they talk about themselves as being Davos man, they don't talk about what they do
[3:15:48.080 --> 3:15:52.640]  at Bilderberg. They tried to keep that secret for a number of years that eventually they couldn't
[3:15:52.640 --> 3:15:57.360]  keep it secret any longer. But they were open about Davos. They invite celebrities to come to
[3:15:57.360 --> 3:16:06.480]  Davos. And they're very clear about what that is. And they even created Davos man, who is the ideal,
[3:16:07.280 --> 3:16:12.560]  the international global elite. That's what they call Davos man. Well, Ted Malik just threw them
[3:16:12.560 --> 3:16:19.680]  the gauntlet down to them and said, Davos man is dead. And this is what he had to say.
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:24.560]  This is an interview he had with RT over the weekend. RT said the European Parliament is
[3:16:24.560 --> 3:16:29.600]  somehow trying to veto your appointment as the next ambassador to the European Union.
[3:16:29.600 --> 3:16:34.880]  What's your reaction? He said, well, they must have not gotten the notice that Donald Trump won
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:39.840]  the American election. In other words, that's not their authority to do that. He said, of course,
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:44.560]  ambassadors are chosen by their home countries to represent those countries and those national
[3:16:44.560 --> 3:16:50.080]  interests in foreign capitals in this case in Brussels. And then they say, well, how out of
[3:16:50.080 --> 3:16:54.960]  touch are the elites who are continuing to be in European capitals and the mainstream media when
[3:16:54.960 --> 3:16:59.760]  it comes to Trump? He says, I don't think it's just Europe. It certainly is the case around the
[3:16:59.760 --> 3:17:06.000]  world. The Davos man is dead. We had the Davos world economic form the other week. And of course,
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:09.920]  they had a lot of Hasbens there. The keynote speakers were all people who were leaving office.
[3:17:09.920 --> 3:17:14.480]  For example, the US Secretary of State John Kerry, the leader of China was their poster boy for
[3:17:14.480 --> 3:17:20.000]  globalization. In effect, China has been the beneficiary of globalization. The 300 million
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  jobs that were created in China was a significant economic fact, but lots of those jobs were taken
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:33.440]  out of the hallowed places of Western Europe and Middle America. This is Ted Malick, the guy that
[3:17:33.440 --> 3:17:38.800]  Donald Trump has picked for EU ambassador. And so you look at this, you look at the strong statements
[3:17:38.800 --> 3:17:44.000]  that this guy's made. My first response to it was, why don't we get this guy as the UN ambassador?
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:48.880]  I mean, Trump put in Nikki Haley, who's really a statist establishment politician, if there ever
[3:17:48.880 --> 3:17:54.240]  was one, to be the UN ambassador. And I thought, it really does make a lot of sense. It's really
[3:17:54.240 --> 3:17:59.680]  smart that the Trump administration, Trump and Bannon and others would look at this and say, look,
[3:17:59.680 --> 3:18:06.640]  we can't take on the EU unless we've got allies. We will have allies if some of these European
[3:18:06.640 --> 3:18:13.040]  nations can reclaim their national sovereignty and leave the European Union. Then we will have some
[3:18:13.040 --> 3:18:19.680]  allies in the fight against the true center enemy, the United Nations, if you will, the Death Star.
[3:18:20.320 --> 3:18:24.800]  So you're going to get some of these other allies freed so they can join you in the fight.
[3:18:24.800 --> 3:18:29.760]  It was also interesting yesterday. And so that was on Saturday that he said Davos Man is dead.
[3:18:30.400 --> 3:18:36.640]  Then Ted Malick goes on the BBC on Sunday and he's talking about the collapse of the European
[3:18:36.640 --> 3:18:41.920]  Union. And he said, Trump hopes that Europe succeeds completely and he wants to deal with them
[3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:48.320]  bilaterally. But obviously, he doesn't want a union that is tilted towards Germany. I mean,
[3:18:48.320 --> 3:18:54.240]  he's telling it like it is. I can't believe the candor of these people and the Trump administration,
[3:18:54.240 --> 3:18:59.920]  especially Ted Malick. Here he's saying, look, Germany is in charge of the European Union.
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:03.120]  You all know that. The people in Britain knew that. That's one of the reasons why they picked
[3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:08.160]  Brexit. They said, we don't want to be run by Germany. Forget about Brussels. That's just window
[3:19:08.160 --> 3:19:15.280]  dressing. The people who are truly running the European Union are the Germans. And so he said,
[3:19:15.280 --> 3:19:23.200]  look, I hope that they succeed and we will deal with them one on one, a bilateral, two, two sides,
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:28.320]  the United States and Britain, the United States and France, the United States and Spain, whatever.
[3:19:28.320 --> 3:19:35.200]  They will deal with them on an individual basis, but he does not want to have a massive bureaucracy
[3:19:35.200 --> 3:19:40.240]  that is multilateral. That is the core of the issue. We got some other great quotes from this guy.
[3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:46.240]  I mean, he is truly an interesting guy and really said some very interesting things this Saturday
[3:19:46.240 --> 3:19:50.000]  and Sunday. Stay with us. We'll be right back. And we're going to have Donald Trump's speech
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:54.640]  from CENTCOM at McGill Air Force Base. Wow, look at these roses. They're gorgeous.

[3:20:50.560 --> 3:20:57.440]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation. Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[3:20:57.440 --> 3:21:01.520]  Let me just read a little thing here. The American system of justice must be changed to
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:06.240]  conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to take the backseat to the
[3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:09.440]  collective. Well, you know what the next one's gonna be, don't you? It's gonna be coming after
[3:21:09.440 --> 3:21:14.400]  you, good? Oh, yeah. I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all. It ain't gonna sit well.
[3:21:14.400 --> 3:21:21.120]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America? They lost. We won. Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[3:21:21.120 --> 3:21:26.320]  It's time to ride, boss. We need a thousand pallet of beers. When I was a boy, it was okay to be
[3:21:26.320 --> 3:21:33.600]  proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie. And beef was for supper. Revelation,

[3:22:04.240 --> 3:22:10.720]  stressed out. It gave me so much more energy. Energy to walk, energy to play sports. Everything

[3:23:59.280 --> 3:24:14.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're going to continue what happened
[3:24:14.240 --> 3:24:20.080]  this last week with the tentative pick for the European Union as an ambassador. Donald Trump's
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:26.960]  pick for the European Union ambassador. Ted Malick had some amazing and interesting things to say
[3:24:26.960 --> 3:24:32.880]  this last weekend. And as I pointed out in the last segment, there is a move to try to block
[3:24:32.880 --> 3:24:38.560]  his appointment. And he said, look, maybe they don't realize that Trump won the American election.
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:43.040]  Ambassadors are chosen by their home countries to represent those countries and their national
[3:24:43.040 --> 3:24:46.880]  interests and foreign capitals, in this case in Brussels. So, you know, you don't understand what
[3:24:46.880 --> 3:24:51.680]  an ambassador is for. But that is the way the opposition always tries to react, isn't it?
[3:24:51.680 --> 3:24:58.560]  Whether it is somebody speaking at a university or whether it is a protest or a counter-protest,
[3:24:58.560 --> 3:25:02.800]  they just want to censor the other side. And understandably, they would want to censor
[3:25:02.800 --> 3:25:08.560]  this guy because he is a very effective speaker and he gets exactly to the center of the point
[3:25:08.560 --> 3:25:13.280]  that's going on here. And he says, and of course, he supports Brexit. He thinks that the European
[3:25:13.280 --> 3:25:20.880]  Union, that the euro is going to collapse as well as the European Union. And even the person who is
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:26.720]  not very sympathetic to him in the Guardian says it was never a requirement of envoys to the Soviet
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:32.480]  Union that they support communism or of those to Saudi Arabia that they support the misogyny or even
[3:25:33.120 --> 3:25:38.720]  that they would have to decline to support the Saudi Arabian misogyny or Soviet Union communism.
[3:25:38.720 --> 3:25:44.080]  So, why should the American ambassador to the European Union have to support globalism?
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:48.160]  Of course, they don't. And this is what he had to say. Of course, he said the Davos man is dead.
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:53.440]  We explained what that was. But he also had some other interesting things to say. He said that
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:25:59.040]  Trump hopes that Europe succeeds, but he will deal with people on a bilateral basis and on that
[3:25:59.040 --> 3:26:04.160]  basis alone. But he also had some interesting things to say about Jean-Claude Juncker, the
[3:26:04.160 --> 3:26:09.760]  president of the European Commission. In the same way that you had Nigel Farage talk about
[3:26:09.760 --> 3:26:15.280]  Herman von Rumpoy saying he had the demeanor of a third-rate bank clerk, you have Ted Malick saying
[3:26:15.280 --> 3:26:21.680]  Mr. Juncker was a very adequate mayor, I think, of some city in Luxembourg. Maybe he should go back
[3:26:21.680 --> 3:26:26.800]  and do that again. Of course, Luxembourg being one of the smallest, if not the smallest country.
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:31.040]  If you don't count like the Vatican, I think Luxembourg probably is the smallest country.
[3:26:31.680 --> 3:26:36.320]  I'm sure somebody will fact check me on that. Nevertheless, Luxembourg is incredibly small
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:39.840]  and he wasn't the president of Luxembourg. He was a mayor of a city in Luxembourg and
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:45.120]  so he was really a put down. But he goes on to say this, which is very substantive. He says
[3:26:46.800 --> 3:26:51.680]  Donald Trump has said some things about Germany that have caused concerns in those
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:56.960]  circles in terms of the people in Europe. He says, Trump doesn't like an organization that is
[3:26:56.960 --> 3:27:05.200]  supranational, that is unelected, where the bureaucrats run amok and that is frankly not a
[3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:13.440]  proper democracy. Wow, he laid it out. Think about that. This is a supranational organization that
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:20.240]  is unelected with a massive, unaccountable bureaucracy and isn't a proper democracy.
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:23.280]  Of course, you could say the same thing about Washington too. That's why the bureaucrats in
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:29.200]  Washington are so afraid of Donald Trump. The bureaucrats have been running amok. They basically
[3:27:29.200 --> 3:27:33.760]  write the laws. They've been handed the keys to the city by the Congress who have abdicated their
[3:27:33.760 --> 3:27:39.280]  position. You know, when Nancy Pelosi said we'll have to pass this bill so we can find out what's
[3:27:39.280 --> 3:27:44.800]  in it, that wasn't as crazy as it sounds. It was a reflection of the reality in Washington
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:51.120]  that Congress hands off these massive issues to bureaucracy, which then writes all the laws.
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:56.640]  So we truly do have legislation without representation. So it's going to be very
[3:27:56.640 --> 3:28:02.480]  interesting to see how this develops. He went on to say, and this is one of the things that got
[3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:08.480]  people upset on the BBC yesterday. He said, Trump won't cow down to the powers that be.
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:12.560]  He said this to the BBC. They said, why do you want to have this position
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:17.760]  at all anyway? And you don't like this organization? Well, he said, he's not going to
[3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:22.160]  cow down to the powers that be. He'll speak his mind, even if he gets him in trouble,
[3:28:22.160 --> 3:28:28.960]  or if he's held in disregard by others. It used to be called honesty. But in the age of baby talk
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:36.080]  and political correctness, and mostly bull BS is what he, but he said, it's now regarded as dishonesty.
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:41.920]  And they were very upset that he talked that frankly to them. He said, look,
[3:28:42.640 --> 3:28:48.400]  he's going to tell you what he thinks. And of course, you don't like that. Now we have an age
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:53.040]  in which people are expected to speak in baby talk, and to be politically correct. And we think
[3:28:53.040 --> 3:28:57.360]  that's absolutely BS, and we're not going to do it. And he laid it down. He said, you have
[3:28:57.360 --> 3:29:03.440]  an elected supranational organization that is not responsive and is undemocratic. And we are
[3:29:03.440 --> 3:29:09.840]  going to do everything we can to make sure that that doesn't continue to exist. And that's what
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:14.400]  the Trump administration is doing. He just laid it out right in their face. Now, one of the things
[3:29:14.400 --> 3:29:18.080]  that they're very concerned about, of course, is the French election, which is coming up.
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:24.400]  And so what are they doing? They're now working with Facebook and Google and all the mainstream
[3:29:24.400 --> 3:29:29.200]  French press organizations to say, we're going to vet fake news. We're all going to come together.
[3:29:29.760 --> 3:29:34.320]  And if there's something that doesn't put our perspective out there, we're going to censor it
[3:29:34.320 --> 3:29:38.960]  by saying that it's fake. We're going to push it out of the Facebook and Google feeds. That's the
[3:29:38.960 --> 3:29:41.680]  way they're going to fight in France. Stay with us. We'll be right back with Donald Trump.

[3:29:54.080 --> 3:29:59.520]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[3:29:59.520 --> 3:30:05.200]  me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages
[3:30:05.200 --> 3:30:11.600]  in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[3:30:11.600 --> 3:30:17.440]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now with all the refugees spreading disease
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:22.080]  around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us
[3:30:22.080 --> 3:30:25.280]  about all the stuff that said that there's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in
[3:30:25.280 --> 3:30:30.960]  there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse
[3:30:30.960 --> 3:30:34.480]  at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back
[3:30:34.480 --> 3:30:38.480]  on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks,

[3:33:08.880 --> 3:33:17.200]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're going to cover Donald Trump's
[3:33:17.200 --> 3:33:21.280]  speech. We've got a couple of clips that we're going to play from it that he went to Centcom.
[3:33:21.280 --> 3:33:28.160]  That's at McDell Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. That is now, of course, the United States Central
[3:33:28.160 --> 3:33:34.480]  Command, the hub for operations for Middle East operations. So he was there to talk to them.
[3:33:34.480 --> 3:33:39.120]  And of course, the backdrop of this is what is going on in Iran. So we're going to talk about
[3:33:39.120 --> 3:33:43.840]  that as well. Before we get to that clip and before we talk about what's happening with Iran,
[3:33:43.840 --> 3:33:47.040]  just want to remind you that we have extended until midnight tonight.
[3:33:47.680 --> 3:33:52.640]  And that's the end of it. The 25% off of Alexa Pure Pro water filter systems
[3:33:52.640 --> 3:33:58.640]  and Alexa Pure Breeze air filters at infowarsstore.com. Alexa Pure filtration system,
[3:33:58.640 --> 3:34:06.640]  that's the water filter removes up to 99.9999% of bacteria, disinfectants, contaminants,
[3:34:06.640 --> 3:34:11.760]  and hormones. Because think about it, folks. All of those things are in your water,
[3:34:11.760 --> 3:34:15.280]  whether you're getting water off of a municipal system or whether you're pumping it out of the
[3:34:15.280 --> 3:34:20.320]  ground with your own well. It just has a different mixture depending on where you are. If you're
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:24.880]  getting it out of a well, they may not, nobody's dumping fluoride and chlorine into the water.
[3:34:24.880 --> 3:34:30.160]  But there's also going to be, that may be in there in terms of runoff from a municipal system.
[3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:35.440]  You're also going to possibly have some chemicals like glyphosates that might be used in a rural
[3:34:35.440 --> 3:34:39.600]  setting, more likely to be in your water if you're on a rural system than if you're in the city.
[3:34:39.600 --> 3:34:45.840]  But all of this stuff is there as well as the kind of hormones and contaminants and pharmaceuticals
[3:34:45.840 --> 3:34:51.440]  that accumulate in our water system that are not filtered out by the municipal water filters.
[3:34:51.440 --> 3:34:56.400]  And it's not going to be filtered out by your home filtration system unless you've got something
[3:34:56.400 --> 3:35:03.840]  that can get out, can filter it that closely. 99.9999%. So that's the water filtration system,
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:11.280]  the gravity feed. Also, we have alexipere breeze eliminates 99.97% of airborne contaminants like

[3:35:49.040 --> 3:35:56.640]  Now 10% off at infowarslife.com. So as I said earlier today, we had just about an hour or so ago
[3:35:57.360 --> 3:36:04.880]  that made about an hour and a half now that Donald Trump was at SETCOM. And there he kind of broke
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:08.960]  this down. We're going to have a couple of different segments here. One of these is about NATO. And
[3:36:08.960 --> 3:36:16.080]  again, we were just talking about the tension between the European Union and the Trump administration.
[3:36:16.080 --> 3:36:21.360]  Ted Malick getting very pointed saying we're not going to support a super national organization
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:29.360]  with unelected bureaucrats that flies in the face of democracy. We want to deal one on one with the
[3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:36.880]  individual nations, but not empower this massive predatory bureaucracy. And of course, he also
[3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:43.360]  said this weekend, the Davos man, the international globalists, people like to think of George Soros.
[3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:49.840]  He is the epitome of the Davos man, the man who recognizes no country as his own, but thinks that
[3:36:49.840 --> 3:36:55.680]  the world belongs to him. And he's going to do whatever he, they see the borders as an obstacle
[3:36:55.680 --> 3:37:00.720]  to their power, these elitists. And so this is a guy who used to be, as he put it, a Sherpa. And
[3:37:00.720 --> 3:37:05.520]  that's not a metaphorical phrase. That's really a title that people who put together massive
[3:37:05.520 --> 3:37:12.080]  summits like Davos have for themselves, talking in reference to the summits of Everest and so forth.
[3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:19.600]  But anyway, going back to sitcom, he took on NATO. He said, my administration strongly supports the
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:24.160]  alliance. We only ask that all NATO members make their full and proper financial contributions
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:28.960]  to the alliance, which many of them have not been doing. They're very unfair to us. So let's play
[3:37:28.960 --> 3:37:37.600]  this clip part of Donald Trump's speech at sitcom earlier today.
[3:37:37.600 --> 3:37:44.800]  I don't know, held it there. Let's stop this. That's not Donald Trump. That's Donald Duck.
[3:37:44.800 --> 3:37:48.000]  Let's get that proper speech. You want to roll that back to the beginning?
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:54.240]  Definitely is the defense of our nation. Supreme Court's so important, but we have to defend our
[3:37:54.240 --> 3:38:05.040]  nation. And we will do that, believe me. We will do that. And each and every one of you
[3:38:05.040 --> 3:38:10.240]  is central to that mission. The men and women serving in SENTCOM and SOCOM
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:17.600]  have poured out their hearts and souls for this country. They've really experienced things that
[3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:22.720]  very few people get to experience. You've shed your blood across the continents and the oceans,
[3:38:22.720 --> 3:38:29.920]  you've engaged the enemy on distant battlefields, toiled in the burning heat and bitter cold
[3:38:29.920 --> 3:38:39.680]  and sacrificed everything so that we can remain safe and strong and free. Our administration
[3:38:39.680 --> 3:38:46.160]  will always honor our sacred bond to those who serve, and we will never ever forget you.
[3:38:46.160 --> 3:38:53.920]  Believe me, we will never ever forget you. We will ensure that the men and women of our military
[3:38:53.920 --> 3:39:00.800]  have the tools, equipment, resources, training, and supplies you need to get the job done.
[3:39:00.800 --> 3:39:10.560]  You've seen me say, we've been depleted. Our Navy is at a point almost as low as World War One.
[3:39:10.560 --> 3:39:17.120]  It's a long time ago. It's a long time ago. It's not going to happen anymore, folks. It's not going
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:23.040]  to happen anymore. Not with me. But we will ensure no taxpayer dollars are wasted. I have already
[3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:33.280]  saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation or the F-35. You know about that.
[3:39:34.080 --> 3:39:38.480]  And I want to thank Lockheed Martin, and I want to thank Boeing, and I want to thank all of the
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:45.840]  companies that have really opened up. And when I say opened up, Rick Scott understands this very
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:52.000]  well. Opened up and cut their prices, okay? Because that's what they did. And we've got that program.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:57.520]  It's going to be back in really great shape from really being very troubled. And we are going to
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:03.360]  be taking care of our great veterans. We will make a historic financial investment in the armed forces
[3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:10.960]  of the United States and show the entire world that America stands with those who stand in defense
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:21.520]  of freedom. We have your back every hour, every day, now, and always. That also means getting
[3:40:21.520 --> 3:40:31.520]  our allies to pay their fair share. It's been a very unfair to us. We strongly support NATO.
[3:40:31.520 --> 3:40:37.440]  We only ask that all of the NATO members make their full and proper financial contributions
[3:40:38.400 --> 3:40:44.560]  to the NATO Alliance, which many of them have not been doing. Many of them have not been even
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:53.280]  close. And they have to do that. Central Command and Central Operations Command are at the very
[3:40:53.280 --> 3:41:03.440]  center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism. America stands in awe of your courage.
[3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:09.760]  Those serving at CENTCOM have bravely fought across the theater of war in the Middle East
[3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:17.600]  and bravely battled a vicious enemy that has no respect for human life. Today, we express our
[3:41:17.600 --> 3:41:24.320]  gratitude to everyone serving overseas, including all of our military personnel in Afghanistan.
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:32.720]  SOCOM has dispatched its legendary warriors to the most secret sensitive and daring missions
[3:41:33.280 --> 3:41:42.560]  in defense of the United States of America. No enemy stands a chance against our special forces.
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:49.440]  Not even a chance. They don't have a chance. And that's the way we're going to keep it.
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:54.960]  And you're going to be better off because you're going to have the finest equipment known to man.
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:01.600]  Going to be better off. The proof that our nation has been blessed by God
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:07.520]  looked no further than the men and women of the United States military. They are the greatest
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:13.680]  fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth.
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:19.120]  All right. And as he's talking about readiness and preparedness and having the best equipment,
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:24.640]  I'm hopeful that what he's going to do is get rid of this climate of bureaucracy,
[3:42:24.640 --> 3:42:29.440]  the famous $600 toilet seats and so forth. And we've seen that. He's now negotiated down,
[3:42:29.440 --> 3:42:34.240]  as he pointed out, of the new fighter jet program. Just as he complained initially
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:38.400]  coming in and talking with Boeing about the cost of Air Force One. I think he's going to get more
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:42.880]  for our money. Of course, it's still going to be very expensive because these are custom things.
[3:42:42.880 --> 3:42:50.640]  But also, I hope that Donald Trump is going to look not only at the quantity of things or the
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:56.320]  price of things, but also at the quality. Take a look at this state-of-the-art Zoom alt class
[3:42:56.960 --> 3:43:02.160]  destroyer. This is a stealth destroyer. If you remember that, that was a destroyer that was
[3:43:02.160 --> 3:43:08.320]  designed not to operate in deep water, but in kind of close to the shore. They call that literal.
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:15.040]  And it had to be towed back on its maiden voyages. It only went 50 miles. This is the thing that
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:20.080]  caused, I forget why the price of it was $100 million, a couple of $100 million, incredibly
[3:43:20.080 --> 3:43:23.440]  expensive. It was stealth. If you looked at the thing, it didn't look like a real ship. It looked
[3:43:23.440 --> 3:43:28.960]  like some kind of a toy model because like a stealth fighter, it had these reflective surfaces on it
[3:43:28.960 --> 3:43:34.640]  that were supposed to keep it from being detected by radar. But it went about 50 miles and then had
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:38.400]  to be towed back because its engine broke down and they didn't have a backup engine designed
[3:43:38.400 --> 3:43:44.640]  into that destroyer. See, that's part of what's wrong with the military. And that's what I think
[3:43:44.640 --> 3:43:49.440]  Donald Trump is really going to get to the heart of. Not only the waste in terms of spending,
[3:43:49.440 --> 3:43:55.200]  but also the sloppy design that you see in things like these Zoom alt class destroyers.
[3:43:55.200 --> 3:43:58.000]  That doesn't serve anybody well. That doesn't protect the United States.
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:03.360]  It puts sailors' lives in danger when they break down after going only 50 miles. But it does make
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:08.320]  the military industrial complex a lot of money. And I think Donald Trump is going to take that on.
[3:44:08.320 --> 3:44:13.680]  Hopefully, he will do that in a way that we have seen previous presidents just give them a pass.
[3:44:13.680 --> 3:44:17.360]  But I want to go to the next thing that he was talking about. And of course, this began
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:22.160]  with the test firing of a missile at the end of the week last week. I think it was on Friday,
[3:44:22.160 --> 3:44:26.800]  they did this. And Iran comes out and says, no, we weren't sending a message to Donald Trump.
[3:44:26.800 --> 3:44:31.760]  Really, you weren't sending a message to them. But at the same time that a very next day,
[3:44:31.760 --> 3:44:36.400]  they come out and they say, this was reported by Jerusalem Post. You can see this on the
[3:44:36.400 --> 3:44:41.440]  drug report. They said, only seven minutes is needed for an Iranian missile to hit Tel Aviv.
[3:44:41.440 --> 3:44:46.160]  This is a senior member of the Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission.
[3:44:46.880 --> 3:44:53.120]  And they told that to the semi-official FARS, Farsi news agency. They did that on Saturday.
[3:44:53.120 --> 3:44:56.800]  So at the same time, they come out and say, you know, don't read anything into this.
[3:44:58.160 --> 3:45:04.880]  And as the articles point out, they've test fired several ballistic missiles since the 2015
[3:45:04.880 --> 3:45:10.320]  sweetheart deal that the Obama administration gave them. But this is the first time they violated
[3:45:10.320 --> 3:45:15.840]  that agreement and the UN prohibitions says Donald Trump has been president.
[3:45:16.720 --> 3:45:20.960]  But I thought it was interesting when the Washington Post came out and said that this
[3:45:20.960 --> 3:45:25.280]  is the title. Of course, the Washington Post always opposes Donald Trump on everything.
[3:45:25.280 --> 3:45:30.000]  Even they'll take the side of Iran against Trump when it comes into this. But the Washington Post
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:36.480]  says Trump wants to push back against Iran. But Iran is now more powerful than ever. And here's
[3:45:36.480 --> 3:45:42.480]  the very first sentence of their article. President Trump's tough talk on Iran is winning him friends
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:48.160]  in the Arab world. But and then they go on to make their case. Think about that. Think about the fact
[3:45:48.160 --> 3:45:55.440]  that Iran is not just chanting death to America every day. Since they took over the Iranian
[3:45:55.440 --> 3:46:01.520]  embassy 40 some odd years ago. No, they are not just chanting death to America, death to Israel,
[3:46:01.520 --> 3:46:08.080]  but the Arab nations don't like Iran as well. You have to understand, Arabs and Muslims are not
[3:46:08.080 --> 3:46:14.880]  this monolithic thing. You've got Saudi Arabia attacking Yemen, you've got Iran and Iraq were
[3:46:14.880 --> 3:46:18.640]  fought each other for quite a long time. Remember that? Remember that Iran-Iraq war?
[3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:26.560]  And so the Arab world is very happy that Trump is talking about keeping them in their place.
[3:46:26.560 --> 3:46:29.520]  I think that's the interesting thing to take a look at. Let's go to this clip
[3:46:29.520 --> 3:46:31.600]  where he talks about Iran today at SIPCOM.
[3:46:32.240 --> 3:46:39.360]  Proof that our nation has been blessed by God. Look no further than the men and women of the
[3:46:39.360 --> 3:46:45.280]  United States military. They are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice
[3:46:46.240 --> 3:46:52.960]  on the face of the earth and that the world has ever known. The challenges facing
[3:46:54.160 --> 3:47:02.320]  our nation nevertheless are very large, very, very large. We're up against an enemy that celebrates
[3:47:02.320 --> 3:47:11.200]  death and totally worships destruction. You've seen that. ISIS is on a campaign of genocide
[3:47:11.200 --> 3:47:18.160]  committing atrocities across the world. Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our
[3:47:18.160 --> 3:47:28.000]  homeland as they did on 9-11, as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino. And all
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:36.000]  across Europe you've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's happening.
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:42.400]  It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported and in many cases the very,
[3:47:42.400 --> 3:47:49.440]  very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.
[3:47:49.440 --> 3:47:57.120]  So today we deliver a message in one very unified voice to these forces of death
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:48:05.520]  and destruction. America and its allies will defeat you. We will defeat them.
[3:48:06.880 --> 3:48:13.840]  We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and we will not allow it to take root in our country.
[3:48:13.840 --> 3:48:18.480]  We're not going to allow it. You've been seeing what's been going on over the last few days.
[3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:28.160]  We need strong programs so that people that love us and want to love our country and will end up
[3:48:28.160 --> 3:48:36.480]  loving our country are allowed in. Not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country.
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:48.880]  That's the military audience at CENTCOM, Central Command in Florida. Let's go back to his speech. They like what he had to say.
[3:48:49.840 --> 3:48:58.080]  Security and justice will prevail. In his first state of the union message, President George Washington
[3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:06.720]  wrote that to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.
[3:49:08.320 --> 3:49:15.200]  Almost 200 years later, as the general was also speaking about Ronald Reagan,
[3:49:16.400 --> 3:49:24.640]  he said that wisdom comes in three very, very strong words. Peace through strength.
[3:49:24.640 --> 3:49:28.000]  I've said it many times during the campaign,
[3:49:29.040 --> 3:49:34.640]  speaking in front of tens of thousands of people at one sitting, and I'd always mention
[3:49:35.520 --> 3:49:42.400]  America first, a phrase that you probably never heard, make America great again. Anybody out here?
[3:49:46.320 --> 3:49:52.720]  And peace through strength. The men and women of the United States military provide the strength
[3:49:52.720 --> 3:50:00.880]  to bring peace to our troubled, troubled times. We stand behind you, we support your mission,
[3:50:01.760 --> 3:50:11.440]  we love our country, we are loyal to our people, we respect our flag, we celebrate our traditions,
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:20.160]  we honor our heroes, you are our heroes, and we are prepared to fight and we pray for peace.
[3:50:20.160 --> 3:50:27.600]  Peace. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
[3:50:27.600 --> 3:50:31.840]  And again, that's Donald Trump speaking at U.S. Central Command at McDill Air Force Base
[3:50:31.840 --> 3:50:35.920]  in Tampa earlier today. He said we will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. We will not allow
[3:50:35.920 --> 3:50:41.200]  it to take root in our country. People that love us and want to love us will be allowed in,
[3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:48.880]  not those who want to destroy us. That is why we have to know who is coming into this country.
[3:50:48.880 --> 3:50:50.320]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[3:51:18.960 --> 3:51:23.280]  These are not the normal signs of aging. They are the warning signs that accompany

[3:53:55.840 --> 3:54:01.040]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:54:04.720 --> 3:54:06.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[3:54:06.800 --> 3:54:12.080]  You know we saw in the wake of Donald Trump appointing Neil Gorsuch, nominating him,
[3:54:12.080 --> 3:54:17.040]  I should say, for Supreme Court chair that was vacated by Justice Scalia's death.
[3:54:17.760 --> 3:54:22.960]  We saw liberals start to say, wait a minute, this could get really bad for us because Donald
[3:54:22.960 --> 3:54:28.320]  Trump is going to nominate solid conservative judges to the Supreme Court. Now this particular
[3:54:28.320 --> 3:54:33.360]  seat is not going to change the balance of the Supreme Court, but it's likely that there might be
[3:54:33.360 --> 3:54:37.040]  as many as three more. There are three more liberal or liberal-leaning
[3:54:37.600 --> 3:54:42.800]  justices who are quite elderly and quite beyond the average retirement age for Supreme
[3:54:42.800 --> 3:54:48.320]  Court justices of 79. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83 and she's already had a couple of bouts of cancer,
[3:54:48.320 --> 3:54:52.480]  one of them pain-creatic cancer, which is usually a death sentence. So the liberals are concerned
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:54:59.360]  about her health. A lot of them are taking to social media saying, is she getting enough fresh air?
[3:54:59.360 --> 3:55:05.200]  Is she walking? Is she staying low stress? Is she getting enough fiber? Is she eating kale?
[3:55:05.200 --> 3:55:08.480]  Have her eat more kale? Can we put somebody on there to take care of her health? Well,
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:12.480]  you know what you can do liberals? You can take a look at the products that we sell at
[3:55:12.480 --> 3:55:16.560]  InfowarsLife.com and we have, if you're worried about her getting enough fresh air,

[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:31.520]  at InfowarsLife.com. Now, the interesting thing about this, of course, is they're saying,
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:36.960]  can't she eat more kale? That's the top of the title of that article. And of course,
[3:56:36.960 --> 3:56:43.040]  if she were in Europe, she might have difficulty doing that. Because in Europe, they're experiencing
[3:56:43.040 --> 3:56:50.960]  a severe shortage of vegetables. Why? Because of climate. It's very cold. It's not global warming
[3:56:50.960 --> 3:56:55.840]  folks. It is so cold in Europe that they can't grow vegetables reliably. They say shops across
[3:56:55.840 --> 3:57:01.120]  Europe, particularly in the UK, have seen their shelves stripped of green produce like lettuce,
[3:57:01.120 --> 3:57:08.720]  broccoli, spinach, kale, eggplant, zucchinis. And the reason is they have cold weather that is
[3:57:08.720 --> 3:57:15.120]  overtaken even southern Europe, even places like Spain where they typically grow vegetables this
[3:57:15.120 --> 3:57:21.120]  time of year. They're able to do that there now. They are being frozen out because of cold weather.
[3:57:21.120 --> 3:57:27.440]  You see, the data continues to overtake them. That story was up on the Drudge Report, along with
[3:57:27.440 --> 3:57:34.960]  this one over the weekend about how NASA and NOAA, that's the climate organizations here,
[3:57:34.960 --> 3:57:40.640]  they're saying that the climate data is fake data. This is coming from realclimatescience.com.
[3:57:41.280 --> 3:57:45.760]  And of course, they're showing places where there is supposedly record heat,
[3:57:45.760 --> 3:57:52.080]  but they don't have any data from those areas. Okay, we've talked about how they want to discount
[3:57:52.080 --> 3:57:57.920]  satellite imaging data, which shows that there is no warming trend. They say, oh, but we have our
[3:57:57.920 --> 3:58:02.800]  thermometers that we've recorded this on. And not only have they moved the thermometers to,
[3:58:02.800 --> 3:58:08.080]  like, airport runways to underscore their data, but they're also saying that they have
[3:58:08.800 --> 3:58:13.520]  thermometer data from places where they don't even have any instruments. That's what this,
[3:58:13.520 --> 3:58:18.720]  that's what this, that's the level of deception that we've got. Meanwhile, they say, Donald Trump
[3:58:18.720 --> 3:58:22.480]  is shutting down climate science. No, he's not. He's calling your bluff. He's showing you,
[3:58:23.280 --> 3:58:27.600]  showing what you're, that you've been trying to hide the decline in temperatures, but we can all
[3:58:27.600 --> 3:58:30.880]  see it. That's it for today's broadcast. Join us tonight for the N4Wars Nightly News.
[3:58:30.880 --> 3:58:40.880]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
