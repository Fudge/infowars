[00:00:05.273 --> 00:00:06.575]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:08.356]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:10.098]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.098 --> 00:00:11.700]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.242]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:17.446]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:21.511]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:26.882]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:31.585]  Today I'm David Knight, your host on this Monday, February the 9th, 2015.
[00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:35.448]  I'll be joined in the next hour by Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:37.369]  We're going to talk about some breaking news.
[00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.792]  There's a lot of breaking news across the waterfront today.
[00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:41.973]  We've got the U.S.
[00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:49.638]  continuing to push for escalation in Ukraine, continuing to push for war right at the door front of the Russians.
[00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:53.421]  This is essentially the Cuban Missile Crisis in reverse.
[00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.622]  And of course, Ted Cruz
[00:00:55.362 --> 00:01:04.626]  His father was very much involved in the fight against Castro, knows very well the history of the Cuban Missile Crisis, but now they're essentially setting this up in reverse.
[00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:12.910]  Trying to start, in my opinion, and in the opinion of most of the people in Europe, who are very concerned about this, looks like they're trying to start a massive war with Russia.
[00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.631]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:21.575]  We've also got the looming budget crisis for homeland security, not fully funding homeland security.
[00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:28.278]  And Senator McCluskey out of Maryland is issuing some dire warnings.
[00:01:28.278 --> 00:01:30.159]  This is something to be very scared about.
[00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.623]  She says, it leaves us open to attacks from ghoulish, grim predators.
[00:01:36.623 --> 00:01:37.743]  There you go.
[00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:42.406]  The only thing saving you from ghoulish, grim predators is the TSA.
[00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:45.899]  I'm sorry, I thought they were the ghoulish Grim Predators.
[00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.522]  We've also got the Supreme Court weighing in on gay marriage, saying that that's okay to have gay marriage.
[00:01:51.522 --> 00:01:57.666]  And so now I guess that some politically appointed judges say that they're going to redefine marriage.
[00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:02.990]  I guess we should all just shut up and accept the definition, like we should shut up and take our vaccines.
[00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.772]  They don't need our consent.
[00:02:04.772 --> 00:02:08.837]  They don't care what the majority of people think about marriage.
[00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.540]  And of course, I first saw this story.
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.849]  We'll talk about this in the next segment, but this first came up when I was traveling with Libertarian candidate for president, North Carolina, Andre Marou.
[00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.855]  He was asked about gay marriage, and I'll tell you what he said 20-some-odd years ago.
[00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:27.520]  That was 92, so that's about 23 years ago.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.407]  I think it still holds today, and I'm very sad to see the Libertarian Party essentially change their position on this.
[00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:33.767]  And of course,
[00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:44.354]  HSBC, Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank, the bank that got its start in the drug-opium wars of China.
[00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:45.615]  They're at it again.
[00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:47.337]  We've had whistleblowers in the past.
[00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:48.577]  We've interviewed several times.
[00:02:48.577 --> 00:02:56.644]  Everett Stern on the Nightly News, as well as on the radio program here, Alex Jones' radio program, blowing the whistle on money laundering.
[00:02:56.644 --> 00:03:01.908]  They've been caught multiple times laundering money for drug dealers, for terrorists abroad.
[00:03:01.908 --> 00:03:03.149]  Now they've been caught
[00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.530]  With tax evasion schemes.
[00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.110]  It just keeps coming.
[00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.572]  But of course, if we look at what's happened in the past, I'm sure they'll get off with a slap on the wrist.
[00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:14.032]  Nobody ever goes to jail.
[00:03:14.032 --> 00:03:16.533]  Remember what the Department of Justice said?
[00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:21.535]  They said, you know, these money laundering scandals that are so gigantic, anybody else would go to jail.
[00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:28.177]  But, you know, it really doesn't serve a purpose, which is what Eric Holder's Justice Department said.
[00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:30.358]  It doesn't serve a purpose to send these guys to jail.
[00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:36.460]  We can't really shut down one of these banks, as everybody at that point said, and it was very true.
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.142]  They're not only too big to fail, they're too big to jail.
[00:03:40.142 --> 00:03:43.303]  They can, and do, get away with anything.
[00:03:43.303 --> 00:03:48.505]  And I'm going to play again for you some of the clips from a 60 minutes investigation
[00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:52.314]  But they did 40 years ago.
[00:03:52.314 --> 00:03:54.878]  Remember the swine flu epidemic?
[00:03:54.878 --> 00:03:56.780]  Wasn't really an epidemic.
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.886]  But it did injure a lot of people with the vaccine that they forced on the public.
[00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:06.973]  So we're going to play a couple of clips of that as well as a clip that I thought yesterday was just truly amazing.
[00:04:07.373 --> 00:04:10.855]  Of a guy from some website called Blue Nation.
[00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:14.657]  He's going to tell you why you should just shut up and take the vaccine.
[00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:34.789]  And of course we've seen this appeal to authority, the idea that somehow, even though the individuals are not effectively vaccinated, are protected from these diseases, even though it doesn't work for an individual, somehow if we put everything into some kind of a collective and call it a herd immunity, somehow that works.
[00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:41.559]  We're going to talk about the notion as to whether or not you can have herd immunity if you don't have individual immunity.
[00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:48.189]  You can't sacrifice individual rights for the greater good, because we're all fundamentally individual.
[00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:49.311]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back.
[00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:06.438]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:32.922]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:32.922 --> 00:06:37.204]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:37.204 --> 00:06:38.984]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:44.306]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:46.847]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:47.987]  But for how long?
[00:06:47.987 --> 00:06:54.609]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:54.609 --> 00:06:57.430]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.515]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:07:02.515 --> 00:07:06.020]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.109]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:13.491]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:15.614]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:07:15.714 --> 00:07:17.276]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:07:17.276 --> 00:07:22.063]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:07:22.063 --> 00:07:26.669]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.313]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[00:07:29.313 --> 00:07:31.496]  And to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month,
[00:07:31.636 --> 00:07:37.339]  We're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.

[00:08:11.747 --> 00:08:18.852]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:18.852 --> 00:08:24.075]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, February the 9th, 2015.
[00:08:24.075 --> 00:08:28.698]  We're going to be joined in the next hour, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:08:28.698 --> 00:08:31.320]  I'm David Knight, your host for this show today.
[00:08:32.273 --> 00:08:39.180]  The last couple of days, actually the last week, we've been talking about informed consent.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.683]  And this is coming out in a number of different ways today.
[00:08:42.683 --> 00:08:52.754]  We have another report about the EPA setting up people to be gassed in little chambers to extend their regulatory reach on fine particulate matter.
[00:08:53.314 --> 00:09:00.697]  If you remember, when I first began at InfoWars a couple of years ago, there was a story that was breaking out of North Carolina at the time.
[00:09:00.697 --> 00:09:06.020]  They were literally hooking people up directly to the tailpipe of a diesel truck.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.722]  They had searched for people who had respiratory and heart issues.
[00:09:10.722 --> 00:09:14.044]  They were trying to find people who were going to have an adverse reaction to this.
[00:09:14.964 --> 00:09:22.706]  Now, according to testimony from the EPA, this was something that kills more people than cancer does.
[00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:28.168]  And yet, they were exposing people to levels that were 70 times higher than what they said were dangerous.
[00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:32.369]  Not just make you sick, she emphasized when Lisa Jackson talked to Congress.
[00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:35.010]  Not just make you sick, this will kill you.
[00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.550]  We're talking about deaths, is what she said.
[00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.971]  Now, if you have a situation like that,
[00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:42.996]  You can never get informed consent.
[00:09:42.996 --> 00:09:55.272]  It's a violation of every civil and criminal law, both in America and nationally, to experiment on people and something that you say is going to kill them.
[00:09:55.272 --> 00:09:56.954]  But of course, they don't really care anymore.
[00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.932]  We see this story coming out of Austin.
[00:10:00.932 --> 00:10:10.739]  We've got a lawsuit in Austin where cops were said to put a bag on a woman's head, strap her to the chair, and choke her so they could draw blood for a DUI test.
[00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:13.661]  This is an article that's up on Infowars.com today.
[00:10:13.661 --> 00:10:14.702]  Steve Watson.
[00:10:14.702 --> 00:10:25.450]  A woman is suing a host of parties after it emerged that cops in Austin, Texas forcibly took her blood for a DUI test in a scene that sounds more like something that would occur at Gitmo.
[00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:35.413]  She was taken to a small padded room where she was surrounded by officers, strapped into the chair with her legs, wrists and shoulders restrained.
[00:10:35.413 --> 00:10:39.414]  They continued to abuse her to take her blood in order to stop her from trembling.
[00:10:39.414 --> 00:10:45.576]  One of the officers used a choke hold, pressure points on her neck until her body went limp, says the complaint.
[00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:49.784]  The defendant, Ramsey Graham, stabbed Ms.
[00:10:49.784 --> 00:10:51.146]  Callaway again while Ms.
[00:10:51.146 --> 00:10:57.071]  Callaway was limp, continues, and when the officer released her neck, she gasped for air.
[00:10:57.071 --> 00:11:07.601]  She could not see because there was a bag over her head, but she felt the weight of a boot in the crook of her arm, which along with the rest of her body was still tied to the chair.
[00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:12.624]  See, they don't need your stinking consent.
[00:11:12.624 --> 00:11:14.306]  They don't need no stinking badges.
[00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:16.107]  They don't need no stinking law.
[00:11:16.107 --> 00:11:17.568]  They're law unto themselves.
[00:11:17.568 --> 00:11:27.975]  And yet, we've got the mainstream media, we've got people like Megyn Kelly, who a year ago, the left was laughing about the fact that she said everybody knows that Santa Claus is white.
[00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:32.898]  Now they're embracing her, when she says, you've got to have big brother sometime.
[00:11:32.898 --> 00:11:34.980]  This is what big brother looks like.
[00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:40.938]  Let's play a clip of a report out of Atlanta, because this is not just happening in Austin.
[00:11:40.938 --> 00:11:42.939]  And it's not just limited to DUIs.
[00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:44.699]  It's not just limited to the EPA.
[00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:46.719]  They're going to do it to everybody.
[00:11:46.719 --> 00:11:50.780]  That's why they're hyping this little measles outbreak out of Disney.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.921]  Let's play this clip out of MyFox Atlanta, where they're doing the same type of forced blood draw.
[00:12:13.273 --> 00:12:20.537]  What they're doing at the Gwinnett County Jail is strapping down suspected drunk drivers to a gurney so a nurse can take their blood.
[00:12:20.537 --> 00:12:25.761]  Evidence that can be used against them later in court, even though the suspects refuse to give their consent.
[00:12:26.221 --> 00:12:28.502]  What country is this?
[00:12:28.502 --> 00:12:30.663]  What country is this?
[00:12:30.663 --> 00:12:34.265]  David Boyle is a former Gwinnett prosecutor, now defense attorney.
[00:12:34.265 --> 00:12:47.491]  Holding down and forcing someone to submit this is really intrusive in terms of that level of invasive procedure into somebody's body is ridiculous for investigating a misdemeanor.
[00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:48.951]  Intrusive, certainly.
[00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:50.212]  Invasive, you bet.
[00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:51.993]  But legal?
[00:12:51.993 --> 00:12:53.655]  Yes, say authorities.
[00:12:53.655 --> 00:12:56.877]  Even though the law supposedly gives you a choice.
[00:12:56.877 --> 00:13:07.045]  To get a Georgia driver's license, you have to agree to take a state-administered test, like this Intoxalizer 5000, if an officer suspects you've been drinking and driving.
[00:13:07.045 --> 00:13:09.047]  It's called implied consent.
[00:13:09.047 --> 00:13:12.930]  You can refuse, but if you do, you lose your license for a year.
[00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.254]  Plus, that decision can be used as evidence against you when you go to trial.
[00:13:17.734 --> 00:13:23.640]  Still, a growing number of DUI defense attorneys suggest you should say no to the test if you've been drinking.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:36.091]  In fact, many advise refusing all field sobriety tests, claiming you're simply helping the police manufacture evidence against you, and a one-year suspension might be preferable to having a drunk driving conviction on your record.
[00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:41.836]  Veteran lawmen like Douglas County Sheriff Phil Miller admit that strategy has made their job tougher.
[00:13:41.836 --> 00:13:42.397]  If you're drunk,
[00:13:43.278 --> 00:13:44.480]  Okay, let's hold it right there.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.545]  One of the things they say in this report, of course, which is pretty amazing, is that...
[00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:57.977]  You can refuse a breathalyzer test, but you can't refuse having the blood drawn, because you gave your implied consent when you got a driver's license.
[00:13:57.977 --> 00:14:09.225]  Maybe people ought to start thinking and rethinking this whole idea that we have turned the fundamental right to travel into a government-granted privilege with these driver's licenses.
[00:14:09.225 --> 00:14:12.868]  That's maybe the core issue at the bottom of all this, but if you see somebody
[00:14:13.368 --> 00:14:22.273]  And you're on a jury, and I don't know what they do with jury trials in Georgia, but certainly in Texas, you have an opportunity to have a jury trial for any of these traffic violations.
[00:14:22.273 --> 00:14:25.415]  If you see something like this, you ought to let these people go.
[00:14:25.415 --> 00:14:37.442]  If they're going to start strapping people down and doing what they did here in Austin, putting a bag over your head, strapping them into the chair, getting violent with somebody so that they can draw blood out,
[00:14:38.703 --> 00:14:42.546]  That is a situation where if I was in a jury, I would let that person go.
[00:14:42.546 --> 00:14:47.329]  That is so over the top, but that is what they're going to do with vaccines.
[00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:55.155]  I think it's kind of ironic, I was talking about this with my son Lance last night, and we're laughing about the fact that people are acting like the lemmings.
[00:14:55.155 --> 00:15:05.422]  Remember that Disney True Life adventure where they told us all that the lemmings were rushing in this suicidal race over the edge of the cliff, when in actuality they were pushing them over?
[00:15:06.857 --> 00:15:17.480]  It's kind of ironic that now Disney is part of this lemming-like move towards medical tyranny that we see the left embracing, left and right.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.680]  Let's play a clip.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.020]  We had a clip yesterday we played.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.801]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:28.502]  This is something that my sister-in-law put up on Facebook, and she actually agrees with this idiot.
[00:15:28.502 --> 00:15:31.223]  This guy's name is Jesse Bernie, I think.
[00:15:31.223 --> 00:15:33.684]  He writes for something called the Blue State.
[00:15:33.684 --> 00:15:34.384]  Let's play this clip.
[00:15:35.287 --> 00:15:38.329]  You know what one of modern medicine's greatest accomplishments is?
[00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:39.690]  Vaccines.
[00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.573]  Now, you've probably heard about the outbreak at Disneyland.
[00:15:43.573 --> 00:15:52.960]  It's up to nearly a hundred confirmed cases of measles, a disease which we could completely eradicate if everyone would just vaccinate their damn kids.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.843]  Some people still choose not to vaccinate, and the reasons are terrible.
[00:15:57.683 --> 00:15:59.565]  He doesn't tell us what the reasons are though.
[00:15:59.565 --> 00:16:03.029]  You don't know your child's body better than your pediatrician does.
[00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:07.855]  He went to like a special school where he studied your child's body for years.
[00:16:07.855 --> 00:16:09.596]  He knows all the names of all the parts.
[00:16:10.612 --> 00:16:11.893]  Including the parts on the inside.
[00:16:11.893 --> 00:16:17.395]  And he knows what medicines protect your child against terrible diseases.
[00:16:17.395 --> 00:16:17.816]  There we go.
[00:16:17.816 --> 00:16:20.057]  Second, you're not just making that choice for yourself.
[00:16:20.057 --> 00:16:28.501]  He, like, went to school for, like, a long time, and he, like, totally knows all the names of your kid's body parts, even the ones on the inside.
[00:16:28.501 --> 00:16:29.582]  So you should just shut up.
[00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:32.484]  And take the vaccine for your damn kids.
[00:16:32.484 --> 00:16:35.926]  That's the anger that's behind this, that's being directed at us.
[00:16:35.926 --> 00:16:49.096]  And this guy, on his bio, says that he's been a voice for Democrat campaigns, he's consulted for a diverse array of campaign organizations, written for dozens of Democrat elected officials and surrogates, including Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:57.565]  Ted Kennedy, Robert Redford, Elizabeth Warren, he also has had work published in the Guardian, Salon, Wonka, Huffington Post.
[00:16:57.565 --> 00:17:04.612]  Doesn't surprise me because we see those same left-wing rags pushing for mandatory vaccines.
[00:17:05.433 --> 00:17:13.659]  The way this is going to look is you're going to have these SWAT teams that break into your home and strap you down just like you see them doing with DUI people.
[00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:22.987]  Forcibly not extracting your blood, but forcibly injecting you with something for which they do not have your consent, nor do they care to have your consent.
[00:17:23.936 --> 00:17:30.757]  You know, 40 years ago, and we talked about this yesterday, I'm gonna play some of the clips today again, because it's just so amazing.
[00:17:30.757 --> 00:17:42.320]  60 minutes, 40 years ago, when the broadcast companies weren't totally owned by the pharmaceutical companies, they actually went back and did a post-mortem on the swine flu scare of 1976.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.961]  They had more than 40 million people get vaccinated.
[00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:52.222]  And as Mike Wallace talks to the then head of the CDC, David Spencer,
[00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:59.471]  He just died a couple years ago at 86, but he was affiliated with the CDC his entire life.
[00:17:59.471 --> 00:18:05.837]  Nothing that he did with this swine flu situation, nothing tarnished his reputation.
[00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:08.479]  He actually became the CDC's historian.
[00:18:08.479 --> 00:18:11.001]  He worked on the board for a long period of time.
[00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:13.403]  What they did was they injected over 40 million people.
[00:18:13.403 --> 00:18:18.408]  They had 4,000 people sue the government because of permanent
[00:18:19.048 --> 00:18:21.831]  damage that was very seriously that was done to them.
[00:18:21.831 --> 00:18:23.292]  Many people died.
[00:18:23.292 --> 00:18:27.836]  There was a lot of Guillain-Barre syndrome that came out of this and autoimmune disease.
[00:18:27.836 --> 00:18:38.186]  Mike Wallace interviews a lady who basically was paralyzed so much they had to do a tracheotomy so that she could even breathe and she would never fully regain the use of her limbs.
[00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:42.129]  Her husband was grief stricken because he pushed her to get the vaccine.
[00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.112]  And they even talked about how they had celebrity endorsements.
[00:18:46.112 --> 00:18:48.072]  Let's play one of those clips here, guys.
[00:18:48.072 --> 00:18:52.555]  Let's play the one about the no cases of flu.
[00:18:52.555 --> 00:18:56.416]  Let's play that one from the 60 Minutes Report.
[00:18:56.416 --> 00:18:57.557]  This is 40 years ago.
[00:18:57.557 --> 00:19:01.339]  See, 40 years ago, they lied to people in order to get their consent.
[00:19:02.139 --> 00:19:08.141]  Today, they lie to people in order to remove the whole idea that there ought to be any medical consent.
[00:19:08.141 --> 00:19:09.241]  Let's play that clip.
[00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:16.083]  Dr. David Sensor, then head of the CDC, the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, is now in private industry.
[00:19:16.083 --> 00:19:19.825]  He devised the swine flu program and he pushed it.
[00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:23.446]  You began to give flu shots to the American people in October of 76.
[00:19:23.446 --> 00:19:24.766]  October 1st.
[00:19:24.766 --> 00:19:29.448]  By that time, how many cases of swine flu around the world had been reported?
[00:19:29.448 --> 00:19:29.988]  There had been
[00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.160]  Several reported, but none confirmed.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.322]  None confirmed.
[00:19:34.322 --> 00:19:34.762]  No cases confirmed.
[00:19:34.762 --> 00:19:39.950]  Nearly everyone must receive the shot in a public health facility where a doctor might not be present.
[00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:48.222]  Therefore, it was up to the CDC to come up with some kind of official consent form, giving the public all the information it needed about the swine flu shot.
[00:19:49.156 --> 00:19:52.680]  This form stated that the swine flu vaccine had been tested.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.984]  So there you go, they lied to people about the consent form.
[00:19:55.984 --> 00:20:00.790]  They said we've tested this and yet the form of vaccine they gave him was a different one.
[00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:01.992]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[00:22:11.027 --> 00:22:15.950]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:16.930]  The phone line.

[00:22:22.193 --> 00:22:25.935]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:29.399]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[00:23:49.889 --> 00:23:50.789]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.705]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.705 --> 00:24:09.986]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:24:09.986 --> 00:24:22.840]  We were just talking in the last segment about the swine flu debacle of 1976, and it's really eye-opening to go back and look at this report from 60 Minutes, Mike Wallace.
[00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:37.837]  Getting this guy, grilling him, you see the guy sweating on the camera, classic 60-minute stuff, saying, you knew that this vaccine that you were giving people was different than the one that you had them, that you said was tested on the consent form, yet you did it.
[00:24:37.837 --> 00:24:40.099]  You knew there were problems with it, yet you still did it.
[00:24:40.099 --> 00:24:41.160]  He says, no, we didn't know that.
[00:24:41.957 --> 00:24:49.122]  And he's got another guy who was a whistleblower in the CDC saying yes we did and then Mike Wallace produces the document.
[00:24:49.122 --> 00:25:00.191]  We see the same pattern happening over and over again except this time what's changed is there's nobody in the mainstream media to point out that the CDC is doing something wrong.
[00:25:00.931 --> 00:25:02.193]  Like Mike Wallace did.
[00:25:02.193 --> 00:25:09.081]  Today, we have nothing but a unified voice saying, force people to get the vaccine because the vaccine isn't effective.
[00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:17.311]  And no matter how many people who have been vaccinated twice get the disease, they stick to this 99% figure, which is really a lie.
[00:25:17.311 --> 00:25:18.513]  It does not convey 99% immunity.
[00:25:20.555 --> 00:25:28.782]  If you look at an outbreak that happened last year in California, 18% of the people that came down with measles had been vaccinated.
[00:25:28.782 --> 00:25:37.949]  In this most recent outbreak at Disneyland, 14%, I'm sorry, 18% came out two years ago, 14% in this most recent one.
[00:25:37.949 --> 00:25:43.733]  But we had an outbreak in 2011 in New York where patient zero was a twice vaccinated individual.
[00:25:44.554 --> 00:25:49.380]  Everybody that got it from her, the other four patients, were all vaccinated individuals.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.744]  Two of the four who got it from her had records that they had been twice vaccinated.
[00:25:53.744 --> 00:25:54.906]  Yet we see these calls.
[00:25:54.906 --> 00:25:59.731]  We've got calls in California to just get rid of the personal belief exemption.
[00:25:59.731 --> 00:26:01.253]  That's what they call consent.
[00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:05.345]  We're going to give you an exemption if you just don't agree with us.
[00:26:05.345 --> 00:26:07.127]  No, we're going to take that away.
[00:26:07.127 --> 00:26:09.410]  We're not going to let you have consent.
[00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.651]  Just going to remove that.
[00:26:10.651 --> 00:26:18.320]  I got a Wall Street Journal article today saying that doctors are working to ease vaccine fears and they're going to have discussions that are going to be presumptive.
[00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:26.126]  For example, they say, well, you know, if you come in and you talk to the patient and you start off with something like, well, what do you do about shots?
[00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:33.951]  Well, typically they might back off and not take these shots, but you come in and talk to them and say, well, we have to do some shots.
[00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:39.295]  They say in those cases, only 26% of the parents resisted vaccines.
[00:26:39.295 --> 00:26:46.000]  But of course, if that doesn't work, they'll give you the celebrity endorsements like they lied about during the swine flu vaccine.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:46.901]  And if that doesn't work,
[00:26:47.517 --> 00:26:53.199]  They'll just come in and strap you to a gurney like they're doing DUI patients across the country.
[00:26:53.199 --> 00:26:56.820]  Not only here in Austin, but in Georgia and elsewhere.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:06.724]  Just strap you down and draw blood because they don't care about the consent, they don't care about your individual rights, and they don't care about the law or the Constitution.
[00:27:07.898 --> 00:27:18.226]  People need to understand, first and foremost, if you're just going to talk about the science of it, they need to understand that there is no herd immunity if you don't have any individual immunity.
[00:27:18.226 --> 00:27:24.311]  And if you're going to destroy the rights of individuals, the herd is made up of individuals.
[00:27:24.311 --> 00:27:25.832]  So it's not for the greater good.
[00:27:27.042 --> 00:27:30.483]  And we see the same thing is happening yet again with the EPA.
[00:27:30.483 --> 00:27:34.925]  Not informing people of the risks that the EPA has said exist.
[00:27:34.925 --> 00:27:37.926]  Let's play this clip real quickly from the EPA.
[00:27:37.926 --> 00:27:50.871]  This is former Lisa Jackson, EPA administrator, going before Congress in a dog and pony show, trying to step up the regulations on fine particulate matter, saying that she's not talking about people getting sick, but about people dying.
[00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:57.453]  Cumulatively, what are the benefits of cleaning up particulate matter?
[00:27:57.453 --> 00:28:01.295]  Does that help or hurt others to battle cancer?
[00:28:01.295 --> 00:28:03.136]  To battle the impact?
[00:28:03.136 --> 00:28:03.756]  To battle cancer.
[00:28:03.756 --> 00:28:06.037]  See, he's already worked out these answers with her.
[00:28:06.037 --> 00:28:08.618]  Particulate matter or soot causes premature deaths.
[00:28:08.618 --> 00:28:09.698]  It doesn't make you sick.
[00:28:09.698 --> 00:28:13.340]  It's directly causal to dying sooner than you should.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:21.323]  So the impacts of delaying efforts, cost-effective efforts, I might add, to address particulate matter are more people dying sooner than they should.
[00:28:21.403 --> 00:28:24.005]  How would you compare it to the fight against cancer?
[00:28:24.005 --> 00:28:25.245]  Reducing particulate matter?
[00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:26.686]  Yeah, I was briefed not long ago.
[00:28:26.686 --> 00:28:34.611]  If we could reduce particulate matter to healthy levels, it would have the same impact as finding a cure for cancer in our country.
[00:28:34.611 --> 00:28:36.472]  Can you say that sentence one more time?
[00:28:36.472 --> 00:28:37.272]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:37.272 --> 00:28:46.037]  If we could reduce particulate matter to levels that are healthy, we would have an identical impact to finding a cure for cancer.
[00:28:46.037 --> 00:28:47.798]  A bold-faced lie.
[00:28:47.798 --> 00:28:50.100]  A bold-faced lie that she's worked out with Markey.
[00:28:50.902 --> 00:28:57.546]  Now, we had this case that first broke in North Carolina, then we discovered that it was being done to children in California.
[00:28:57.546 --> 00:29:03.529]  Now they've come back to North Carolina and they're trying to single out black teenagers who have asthma.
[00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:05.270]  This is what JunkScience.com says.
[00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.692]  The EPA cannot tell the public, as we just heard the EPA say.
[00:29:09.272 --> 00:29:23.883]  That airborne particulate matter can cause death within hours, even at normal ambient levels, but then not make the same disclosure to the study subjects, who will be tested, this is what they did, at levels up to 70 times greater than what they said would kill you.
[00:29:23.883 --> 00:29:29.147]  You cannot get informed consent to do that kind of
[00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.292]  Life-threatening experiments to people.
[00:29:33.292 --> 00:29:35.734]  This is Tuskegee all over again.
[00:29:35.734 --> 00:29:38.036]  It matters if we have informed consent.
[00:29:38.036 --> 00:29:38.857]  Stay with us.
[00:29:38.857 --> 00:29:44.362]  Right after the break, we're gonna have a special viral report that John Bowne put together, so stay with us.
[00:29:44.362 --> 00:29:48.725]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.725 --> 00:29:50.126]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.126 --> 00:29:52.648]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.648 --> 00:29:55.351]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.434 --> 00:30:02.815]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:30:02.815 --> 00:30:06.337]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:12.399]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:13.800]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.921]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:30:16.021 --> 00:30:17.581]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:30:17.581 --> 00:30:22.363]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:30:22.363 --> 00:30:29.605]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month, how we can come together and win the human race.

[00:33:09.218 --> 00:33:15.365]  If you let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[00:33:15.365 --> 00:33:20.371]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[00:33:20.371 --> 00:33:25.236]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:27.219]  It's not about food.
[00:33:27.219 --> 00:33:29.841]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[00:33:36.491 --> 00:33:38.614]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:38.614 --> 00:33:41.538]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:44.324 --> 00:33:44.724]  That's right.
[00:33:44.724 --> 00:33:45.665]  It's not about the food.
[00:33:45.665 --> 00:33:47.845]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[00:33:47.845 --> 00:33:49.786]  And it's not about the vaccines either.
[00:33:49.786 --> 00:33:52.587]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[00:33:52.587 --> 00:33:57.169]  Ron Paul has an article that's up on Infowars.com talking about how we need market decisions.
[00:33:57.169 --> 00:34:06.412]  We need voluntary, informed consent about what we're going to eat, what we're going to put in our bodies with injections, if we're going to put anything into our bodies with injections.
[00:34:07.032 --> 00:34:12.217]  And we can see from an article from Natural Society, we can see how this can happen.
[00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:17.562]  We've seen the food babe, and she's going to be on the show later in the week with Alex Jones.
[00:34:17.562 --> 00:34:23.387]  She had another victory with General Mills this week, getting them to take out a dangerous preservative that they only put...
[00:34:24.148 --> 00:34:25.908]  In their US cereal.
[00:34:25.908 --> 00:34:29.009]  They don't put it in the cereal anywhere else in the world.
[00:34:29.009 --> 00:34:31.810]  So she pressured them with that and that's the market speaking.
[00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:35.270]  That's people saying we don't want this in our food.
[00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.911]  We saw the same thing happen now with Breyers ice cream.
[00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:44.152]  They said they're going to drop milk with Monsanto's RBST growth hormones.
[00:34:44.152 --> 00:34:46.773]  They're trying to keep this natural food
[00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.574]  Uh, label, which has really been their trademark.
[00:34:50.574 --> 00:34:51.995]  They're trying to keep that going.
[00:34:51.995 --> 00:34:55.797]  They said they've always looked for additive-free food.
[00:34:55.797 --> 00:35:02.400]  Well, the problem is this RBST is something that is genetically grown.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.023]  It's an artificial growth hormone that is actually produced by companies like Monsanto.
[00:35:07.603 --> 00:35:12.384]  And it's very different from the natural bovine growth hormone, regular BST.
[00:35:12.384 --> 00:35:14.265]  This is R-BST.
[00:35:14.265 --> 00:35:24.768]  They say that the R-BST that Breyers is no longer going to have in their, they're not going to accept milk where that growth hormone has been given to the cows.
[00:35:24.768 --> 00:35:30.630]  That growth hormone that is created by Monsanto is actually genetically engineered E. coli bacteria.
[00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:35.912]  It has been banned in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, and the European Union.
[00:35:35.912 --> 00:35:36.652]  But in America,
[00:35:37.475 --> 00:35:43.159]  We've got people like this Jesse Bernie who is just saying, you know, just shut up and take this vaccine.
[00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:44.760]  These guys know what's better for you.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.282]  Look, we've been lied to by the CDC.
[00:35:47.282 --> 00:35:51.145]  We've been lied to by the EPA because they don't want our consent.
[00:35:51.145 --> 00:35:51.966]  They could care less.
[00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:57.748]  If we're informed, they lie to us about what's in the vaccines, about what's in the food.
[00:35:57.748 --> 00:36:06.231]  We see in South Africa, they have had Monsanto was forced to pull advertisements because somebody actually fact-checked them.
[00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:19.475]  They've been saying that GMO crops, quote, enable us to produce more food sustainably whilst using fewer resources, providing a healthier environment by saving on pesticides, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing crop yields substantially.
[00:36:19.475 --> 00:36:21.096]  They said, where's the proof of any of that?
[00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.891]  Monsanto said, all right, we'll pull the ad off.
[00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:28.011]  This is what they're doing time and time again.
[00:36:28.011 --> 00:36:30.212]  It's not about the science.
[00:36:30.212 --> 00:36:32.532]  The science is very clear about vaccines.
[00:36:32.532 --> 00:36:40.494]  Louis Pasteur had to fight conventional wisdom when he explained germs, when they started talking about active immunity and passive immunity.
[00:36:40.494 --> 00:36:45.415]  But it's no longer just about active and passive immunity, or vaccines or germs.
[00:36:45.415 --> 00:36:51.557]  Once you add these types of things to the vaccines, like they're adding to the food, it becomes something completely different.
[00:36:52.637 --> 00:37:06.282]  Speaking of something completely different, oh, before I go to the clip from the special report about the secret covenant, I just want to let you know we're going to have joining us in the third hour, Dr. Dunn from Junk Science.
[00:37:06.282 --> 00:37:11.284]  This is the organization that did the FOIA request that found the information about the EPA human experimentation.
[00:37:11.704 --> 00:37:20.136]  And of course, there's another one that has just started up, so we're going to talk to him about the whole idea of informed consent, especially about these specifics in the EPA.
[00:37:20.136 --> 00:37:22.700]  He's going to be joining us in the third hour.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.985]  Right now, we're going to play for you a special report that's really gone viral.
[00:37:26.866 --> 00:37:28.587]  It's called the Secret Covenant.
[00:37:28.587 --> 00:37:30.587]  This is a document, authors unknown.
[00:37:30.587 --> 00:37:36.209]  We don't know whether this is valid or not, but it is really thought-provoking.
[00:37:36.209 --> 00:37:43.532]  We've seen this type of information when we've seen the globalist agenda essentially go down these lines.
[00:37:43.532 --> 00:37:54.295]  So whether or not these guys believe it, whether or not you believe this is happening or not, we're also going to have this report going up on Facebook and Twitter, and you'll find it on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:54.295 --> 00:37:56.276]  Let's go to the special report, Secret Covenant.
[00:38:03.877 --> 00:38:06.218]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[00:38:06.218 --> 00:38:30.265]  And if there was an outside threat, like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, running the Mujahideen War, and whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now, and sits on the board of Iridium Satellite, and tell them, we know the government's planning terrorism, we know Oklahoma City and World Trade Center was terrorism, we know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners, Baltimore Sun, if you do it, we're going to blame you, because we know who's up to it.
[00:38:30.265 --> 00:38:33.746]  Or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center, we know
[00:38:34.166 --> 00:38:37.250]  I don't know who to blame.
[00:38:56.761 --> 00:39:02.886]  We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us.
[00:39:02.886 --> 00:39:08.330]  We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive.
[00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:11.512]  If you wanted to run against Preston Bush, you should have run four years ago.
[00:39:11.512 --> 00:39:19.899]  The fate of China and the United States have become linked in a way far beyond
[00:39:21.494 --> 00:39:24.557]  What any of us could imagine.
[00:39:24.557 --> 00:39:28.260]  We are now facing a common challenge.
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:39.070]  And the challenge is how to build a world order for the first time in history on a global basis.
[00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:46.978]  Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves.
[00:39:46.978 --> 00:39:47.178]  This
[00:39:49.684 --> 00:39:59.186]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically
[00:40:15.405 --> 00:40:21.349]  Opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:34.358]  We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.
[00:40:34.358 --> 00:40:43.104]  Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.
[00:40:43.104 --> 00:40:43.685]  Even today,
[00:40:44.702 --> 00:40:52.028]  There is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.
[00:40:52.028 --> 00:41:05.958]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
[00:41:07.426 --> 00:41:10.388]  Welcome to He Who Speaks.
[00:41:10.388 --> 00:41:17.772]  We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite.
[00:41:17.772 --> 00:41:24.135]  We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is real.
[00:41:30.313 --> 00:41:31.415]  We're good to go.
[00:41:40.689 --> 00:41:44.452]  The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds.
[00:41:44.452 --> 00:41:48.016]  We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts.
[00:41:48.016 --> 00:41:51.159]  Yet, we will feed them more poison.
[00:41:51.159 --> 00:41:53.100]  There aren't reasons to not get vaccinated.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.802]  Are you telling parents you should get your kids vaccinated?
[00:41:54.802 --> 00:41:56.323]  You should get your kids vaccinated.
[00:41:56.323 --> 00:41:57.144]  It's good for them.
[00:41:57.144 --> 00:42:01.027]  The poisons will be absorbed through their skin and mouths.
[00:42:01.027 --> 00:42:04.390]  They will destroy their minds and reproductive systems.
[00:42:05.191 --> 00:42:12.297]  From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal this information.
[00:42:12.297 --> 00:42:16.280]  The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.264]  In what they drink, eat, breathe, and wear.
[00:42:21.264 --> 00:42:26.248]  We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons, for they can see far.
[00:42:26.248 --> 00:42:32.614]  We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones.
[00:42:33.434 --> 00:42:36.336]  Those they look up to will help.
[00:42:36.336 --> 00:42:40.298]  We will enlist them to push our poisons.
[00:42:40.298 --> 00:42:48.582]  They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect.
[00:42:48.582 --> 00:42:56.546]  When they give birth, we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them it's for their help.
[00:42:56.546 --> 00:42:59.628]  We will start early on when their minds are young.
[00:43:00.409 --> 00:43:04.105]  We will target their children with what children love most.
[00:43:12.449 --> 00:43:13.009]  I'm good.
[00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:49.113]  On Tuesday, Oregon State Police got a tip that a young woman had created a 17-minute porn video that ended up on PornHub.com.
[00:43:49.113 --> 00:43:50.693]  Yeah, it's a buzzer on campus.
[00:44:08.963 --> 00:44:13.525]  Their minds will belong to us, and they will do as we say.
[00:44:13.525 --> 00:44:20.808]  If they refuse, we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives.
[00:44:20.808 --> 00:44:23.849]  We will use fear as our weapon.
[00:44:23.849 --> 00:44:28.091]  We will establish their governments and establish opposites within.
[00:44:28.091 --> 00:44:30.332]  We will own both sides.
[00:44:30.332 --> 00:44:34.213]  We will always hide our objective, but carry out our plan.
[00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:35.934]  They will perform the labor for us.
[00:44:36.534 --> 00:44:40.196]  And we shall prosper from their toil.
[00:44:40.196 --> 00:44:42.958]  Our families will never mix with theirs.
[00:44:42.958 --> 00:44:45.500]  Our blood must be pure always.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.881]  For it is the way.
[00:44:46.881 --> 00:44:49.923]  We will make them kill each other when it suits us.
[00:44:49.923 --> 00:44:56.267]  We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion.
[00:44:56.267 --> 00:45:03.872]  We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how.
[00:45:03.872 --> 00:45:05.693]  We will guide them kindly
[00:45:06.133 --> 00:45:13.838]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:45:30.111 --> 00:45:35.773]  We will make them rip each other's hearts apart and kill their own children.
[00:45:35.773 --> 00:45:42.716]  We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend.
[00:45:42.716 --> 00:45:51.240]  The hate will blind them totally and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.021]  They will be busy killing each other.
[00:45:54.021 --> 00:45:58.103]  They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we
[00:45:59.143 --> 00:46:00.924]  We're good to go.
[00:46:28.112 --> 00:46:32.815]  If we accomplish this, the tools will be provided by their labor.
[00:46:32.815 --> 00:46:37.438]  We will make them hate themselves and their neighbors.
[00:46:37.438 --> 00:46:46.023]  We will always hide the divine truth from them that we are all one.
[00:46:46.023 --> 00:46:48.964]  This they must never know.
[00:46:48.964 --> 00:46:51.546]  They must never know that color is an illusion.
[00:46:58.194 --> 00:47:00.215]  We're good to go.
[00:47:17.447 --> 00:47:25.198]  We will establish a money system that will imprison him forever, keeping them and their children in debt.
[00:47:25.198 --> 00:47:33.410]  When they shall bind together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world, for we shall own them.
[00:47:35.362 --> 00:47:40.967]  We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favor.
[00:47:40.967 --> 00:47:46.772]  When they shall rise up against us, we will crush them like insects.
[00:47:46.772 --> 00:47:48.914]  But they are less than that.
[00:47:48.914 --> 00:47:51.336]  They will be helpless to do anything.
[00:47:51.336 --> 00:47:55.500]  For they will have no weapons.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.923]  We will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans.
[00:47:58.923 --> 00:48:02.466]  We will promise them eternal life, but eternal life they will never have.
[00:48:03.387 --> 00:48:05.771]  We're good to go.
[00:48:23.882 --> 00:48:33.364]  For their work, they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but never will they become immortal and join us.
[00:48:33.364 --> 00:48:38.365]  Never will they receive the light and travel the stars.
[00:48:38.365 --> 00:48:46.327]  They will never reach the higher realms, for the killing of their own kind would prevent passage to the realm of enlightenment.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.820]  The truth will be hidden in their face.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:59.121]  So close they will not be able to focus on it until it is too late.
[00:48:59.121 --> 00:49:00.722]  Oh yes.
[00:49:00.722 --> 00:49:07.583]  So grand the illusion of freedom will be that they will never know they are our slaves.
[00:49:07.583 --> 00:49:13.624]  When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them.
[00:49:13.624 --> 00:49:17.144]  This reality will be their prison.
[00:49:17.144 --> 00:49:19.825]  They will live in self-delusion.
[00:49:20.405 --> 00:49:25.572]  When our goal is accomplished, a new era of domination will begin.
[00:49:25.572 --> 00:49:29.156]  Their minds will be bound by their beliefs.
[00:49:29.156 --> 00:49:34.382]  The beliefs we have established from time immemorial.
[00:49:34.382 --> 00:49:37.366]  But if they ever find out they are our equal.
[00:49:38.328 --> 00:49:42.872]  We're turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[00:49:42.872 --> 00:49:45.295]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:49:45.295 --> 00:49:47.236]  We shall perish then.
[00:49:47.236 --> 00:49:54.843]  This they must never know, if they ever find out that together they can vanquish us.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.783]  Never, ever find out what we have done.
[00:50:02.783 --> 00:50:11.790]  For if they do, we shall have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen.
[00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:19.797]  Our actions will have revealed who we are, and they will hunt us down, and no person shall give us shelter.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.941]  Or spoken of.
[00:50:33.941 --> 00:50:55.360]  For if it is, the consciousness it will spawn will release the fury of the Prime Creator upon us and we shall be cast to the depths from whence we came and remain there until the end time of infinity itself.
[00:51:00.026 --> 00:51:00.847]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:51:00.847 --> 00:51:02.628]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:51:02.628 --> 00:51:04.289]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:51:04.289 --> 00:51:07.111]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:51:07.111 --> 00:51:09.393]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:51:09.393 --> 00:51:13.916]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:51:13.916 --> 00:51:17.859]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:51:17.859 --> 00:51:21.622]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:51:21.622 --> 00:51:21.942]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:51:21.942 --> 00:51:23.684]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:51:29.238 --> 00:51:30.339]  This is an alert.
[00:51:30.339 --> 00:51:34.441]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[00:51:34.441 --> 00:51:38.643]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[00:51:38.643 --> 00:51:44.026]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.
[00:51:44.026 --> 00:51:47.568]  And we're offering rebates of up to $20,000 to help you build today.
[00:51:47.568 --> 00:51:50.770]  Call General Steel for free information that could save you thousands.
[00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:51.210]  Call 866-91-STEEL.
[00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:51.430]  866-91-STEEL.
[00:51:54.892 --> 00:51:58.656]  That's 866-917-8335.
[00:51:58.656 --> 00:52:02.640]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.145]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:52:08.145 --> 00:52:10.568]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:52:13.362 --> 00:52:17.643]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:52:17.643 --> 00:52:19.744]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:52:19.744 --> 00:52:23.025]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:52:23.025 --> 00:52:26.106]  Children left with no homes and no one's coming to help them.
[00:52:26.106 --> 00:52:28.947]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:52:29.167 --> 00:52:31.568]  is a visit to MyPatriotSupply.com.
[00:52:31.568 --> 00:52:39.429]  There, you'll find the absolute best prices on storable foods, non-GMO seeds, emergency water filtration devices, and so much more.

[00:52:43.711 --> 00:52:45.771]  Call 866-229-0927.
[00:52:45.771 --> 00:52:48.032]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:52:48.032 --> 00:52:51.672]  And speak to one of our preparedness advisors today.
[00:52:51.672 --> 00:52:54.513]  Or visit us at MyPatriotSupply.com.
[00:52:54.513 --> 00:52:57.774]  Remember, before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[00:52:58.194 --> 00:53:02.096]  My name's Clyde, age 59, and I reside in Florence, South Carolina.
[00:53:02.096 --> 00:53:04.477]  The doctors diagnosed me as having clogged arteries.
[00:53:04.477 --> 00:53:08.379]  It felt like I was carrying heavy concrete blocks around my feet and legs.
[00:53:08.379 --> 00:53:11.280]  I started taking Heart and Body Extract as directed.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.061]  It is less than three weeks, and now I'm like a young man again.
[00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:18.083]  It's unbelievable that an herbal formula can work so fast and so powerfully.
[00:53:18.083 --> 00:53:26.046]  Learn the secrets of an effective, natural, 100% organic nutritional supplement for a healthy heart and circulation at HBExtract.com.

[00:53:56.741 --> 00:53:57.061]  Go now.
[00:53:59.878 --> 00:54:01.122]  Oh, yeah.
[00:54:11.072 --> 00:54:12.373]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:12.373 --> 00:54:13.414]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:54:13.414 --> 00:54:16.557]  I'll be joined in the next hour with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:54:16.557 --> 00:54:28.126]  We're going to be talking about, of course, your television spying on you, as well as a breaking story that Paul had up that we didn't get to yesterday about white privilege.
[00:54:28.126 --> 00:54:29.347]  So stick with us for that.
[00:54:29.347 --> 00:54:32.510]  Now, we were talking before the break.
[00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.832]  We had the special report about the secret covenant.
[00:54:34.832 --> 00:54:36.353]  Do you think that that's something that
[00:54:37.614 --> 00:54:38.474]  Really doesn't apply?
[00:54:38.474 --> 00:54:42.856]  Take a look at what happened at the Grammys last night.
[00:54:42.856 --> 00:54:43.677]  Let's play this clip.
[00:54:43.677 --> 00:54:53.381]  I'll try to narrate this for people who are listening on the radio right now.
[00:54:53.381 --> 00:54:55.642]  They're just showing the crowd clapping.
[00:55:00.586 --> 00:55:01.547]  Okay, here we go.
[00:55:01.547 --> 00:55:04.111]  Satanic horns.
[00:55:04.111 --> 00:55:06.995]  Key person being lifted up in some kind of a mock sacrifice.
[00:55:06.995 --> 00:55:07.896]  There you go.
[00:55:07.896 --> 00:55:10.179]  Yeah, so, you know, all this Satanism stuff.
[00:55:10.179 --> 00:55:12.202]  These guys really do believe this.
[00:55:12.202 --> 00:55:13.624]  They really do celebrate it.
[00:55:13.624 --> 00:55:16.227]  All you have to do is look at the pop culture.
[00:55:17.128 --> 00:55:19.210]  Now we've been talking a lot about consent.
[00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:24.115]  The fact that the government doesn't feel like they need to inform us or they lie to us in order to gain our consent.
[00:55:24.115 --> 00:55:30.662]  But right now what they're doing is they're lying to us in order to remove the whole idea that there should even be consent.
[00:55:30.662 --> 00:55:32.404]  We're going to be talking in the third hour to Dr. Dunn.
[00:55:34.366 --> 00:55:36.707]  Who's with JunkScience.com.
[00:55:36.707 --> 00:55:43.871]  They've been exposing, through FOIA requests and other research, EPA's human experiments to try to benefit the bureaucracy.
[00:55:43.871 --> 00:55:56.598]  And of course, either they're lying about the dangers of fine particulate matter, or they are violating every ethical law on the books, nationally as well as internationally.
[00:55:56.598 --> 00:55:58.759]  But it's not just health issues.
[00:55:58.759 --> 00:56:03.342]  It's not just what they put in our food where they don't really want our informed consent.
[00:56:04.022 --> 00:56:07.083]  No, it's now even extending to things like homeschooling.
[00:56:07.083 --> 00:56:09.664]  This came up this weekend on Wired Magazine.
[00:56:09.664 --> 00:56:10.824]  Here's the title.
[00:56:10.824 --> 00:56:16.286]  Homeschooling only deepens Silicon Valley's rift with the rest of us.
[00:56:16.286 --> 00:56:20.548]  See, what they're complaining about is just a few months ago they were complaining about the fact that
[00:56:21.028 --> 00:56:45.845]  The educated and the affluent in California were opting to not get their kids vaccinated because they had concerns about the preservatives, about the adjuvants, about contaminants that were being placed into these vaccines because they're not simply vaccines any more than your cereal that is laced with all kinds of chemicals or your fast food products, your french fries that are laced with silica, silly putty.
[00:56:45.845 --> 00:56:47.586]  It's no longer just a potato.
[00:56:47.586 --> 00:56:50.508]  People who were educated, people who were affluent,
[00:56:50.868 --> 00:56:52.229]  We're doing their research.
[00:56:52.229 --> 00:56:56.893]  They weren't happy with the answers that they were getting and what they were seeing, so they decided not to do it.
[00:56:56.893 --> 00:57:01.578]  And so what they're complaining about is, they're saying, hey, this is happening with homeschooling as well.
[00:57:01.578 --> 00:57:02.659]  This is the way they describe it.
[00:57:02.659 --> 00:57:10.626]  They say the same do-it-yourself mentality idealized by Silicon Valley's startup scene is fueling the tech-minded move to homeschooling.
[00:57:11.366 --> 00:57:16.071]  One Silicon Valley parent says, we're going to direct to learning.
[00:57:16.071 --> 00:57:22.777]  We don't need to hold to this old paradigm of top-down where someone tells me what to do.
[00:57:22.777 --> 00:57:26.901]  And an app designer from Brooklyn, meanwhile, he said, reaches straight for Silicon Valley's origin story.
[00:57:26.901 --> 00:57:32.746]  He says, the only possible conclusion is, hey, I could do this better myself out of my garage.
[00:57:33.467 --> 00:57:40.904]  But of course, the person writing for Wired Magazine is not very happy about this, because from their collectivist mindset, you're leaving the herd!
[00:57:40.904 --> 00:57:42.548]  You're leaving the herd behind!
[00:57:43.533 --> 00:57:46.514]  Now, the herd could take care of their own kids.
[00:57:46.514 --> 00:57:49.434]  They could take an interest in their kids' education.
[00:57:49.434 --> 00:57:56.955]  They could do something other than accept the mandated one-size-fits-all system that's being fed to them.
[00:57:56.955 --> 00:57:59.036]  But no, they should stay in the herd.
[00:57:59.036 --> 00:58:08.938]  And even more importantly, we should stop those people who are trying to do the best for their kids, who are looking at a broken system and are saying, I could do better.
[00:58:08.938 --> 00:58:10.678]  I could do better even in my garage.
[00:58:11.641 --> 00:58:18.644]  And yet, they continue to send their kids to these prison schools, as John Whitehead from the Rutherford Institute pointed out.
[00:58:18.644 --> 00:58:21.106]  Now we have handcuffs, leg shackles, and tasers.
[00:58:21.106 --> 00:58:23.647]  That's a new face of punishment in public schools.
[00:58:23.647 --> 00:58:28.249]  So you gotta put your kid in that, rather than having direct education.
[00:58:28.249 --> 00:58:32.571]  Because they don't want you to have the options of freedom.
[00:58:32.571 --> 00:58:34.692]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:58:41.459 --> 00:58:44.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.304 --> 00:58:58.190]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:04.794]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:59:05.294 --> 00:59:08.776]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:59:08.776 --> 00:59:10.417]  population could perish.
[00:59:10.417 --> 00:59:13.898]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:59:13.898 --> 00:59:16.139]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:59:16.139 --> 00:59:17.780]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:19.961]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[00:59:19.961 --> 00:59:24.043]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[00:59:24.043 --> 00:59:29.706]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,

[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:06.677]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.677 --> 01:00:08.438]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.199]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.199 --> 01:00:11.779]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.523]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.523 --> 01:00:21.565]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.379 --> 01:00:27.601]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:27.601 --> 01:00:28.542]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:32.024]  We're going to be joined in the next segment, Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:00:32.024 --> 01:00:36.908]  We're going to cover some of his breaking articles that have come out yesterday and today.
[01:00:36.908 --> 01:00:40.972]  As I was saying in just the last segment, this is all about informed consent.
[01:00:40.972 --> 01:00:46.976]  We're going to be joined in the third hour with Dr. Dunn from JunkScience.com.
[01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:50.019]  It's an organization that has been at the forefront of exposing
[01:00:50.848 --> 01:01:03.695]  I believe some really hideous EPA human testing that raises huge ethical considerations and fundamentally this is an ethical consideration when we're talking about consent.
[01:01:03.695 --> 01:01:05.476]  And it's not just about vaccines.
[01:01:05.476 --> 01:01:07.077]  It's about what's going into your food.
[01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:17.668]  Are we going to apply market pressure to get them to clean up our food, to take out preservatives that are not allowed anywhere else in the rest of the world, yet they're putting it in our food.
[01:01:17.668 --> 01:01:21.108]  Even when we find some of these things and bring it to their attention.
[01:01:21.108 --> 01:01:24.009]  Pepsi, I believe, there was something that was brought to their attention.
[01:01:24.009 --> 01:01:25.069]  They didn't take it out.
[01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:28.190]  They were only putting it in in America, but they refused to take it out.
[01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:30.930]  Coke did, but Pepsi left it in.
[01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:31.990]  This is what we're talking about.
[01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:35.391]  It's violating our consent, misinforming us in a number of ways.
[01:01:36.684 --> 01:01:38.946]  They appeal to authority.
[01:01:38.946 --> 01:01:40.727]  They appeal to credentials.
[01:01:40.727 --> 01:01:43.770]  Let me give you an example of this.
[01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.912]  There was a man, Samuel Pierpont Langley.
[01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.253]  Now, of course, he taught at Harvard.
[01:01:48.253 --> 01:01:50.155]  He taught at the Naval Academy.
[01:01:50.155 --> 01:01:52.597]  He was Secretary of the Smithsonian.
[01:01:52.597 --> 01:01:53.798]  This guy has a lot of credentials.
[01:01:54.508 --> 01:02:00.750]  On the other hand, we've got a couple of guys, Orville and Wilbur Wright, the Wright Brothers.
[01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:04.371]  These are a couple of guys who are just homeschoolers and entrepreneurs.
[01:02:04.371 --> 01:02:09.192]  These guys dropped out of school, wanted to start a printing business.
[01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:12.413]  They then got into a bicycle business.
[01:02:12.413 --> 01:02:16.835]  Now, who would you think would make the first working airplane?
[01:02:16.835 --> 01:02:21.016]  The homeschoolers who dropped out, just making bicycles in their garage?
[01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:25.314]  Or, this guy, Samuel Pierpont Langley.
[01:02:25.314 --> 01:02:28.156]  Harvard, Naval Academy, Smithsonian.
[01:02:28.156 --> 01:02:30.638]  Well, of course, we all know the Wright Brothers did.
[01:02:30.638 --> 01:02:31.959]  Why?
[01:02:31.959 --> 01:02:36.802]  Because they challenged the tables that had false information in them.
[01:02:36.802 --> 01:02:44.847]  They had coefficients of lift and drag that had been put in that, of course, the academic Pierpont Langley just went with.
[01:02:44.847 --> 01:02:46.849]  He wouldn't question the conventional wisdom.
[01:02:47.759 --> 01:03:05.626]  But these two guys who are homeschooled, who are entrepreneurs, who are the very type of people that I was just talking about in the last segment that Wired Magazine commentator was wringing their hands over the fact that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are realizing that, hey, I can do a much better job educating my own kids.
[01:03:05.626 --> 01:03:10.487]  These kids went back and said, you know, maybe the information that we're starting with is not correct.
[01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:16.530]  They went back, they created their own coefficient of drag tables, and they got their airplane to work.
[01:03:17.463 --> 01:03:25.638]  So you should always question when you're being given something and appeal just to authority or to credentials.
[01:03:25.638 --> 01:03:26.519]  I've been through college.
[01:03:26.519 --> 01:03:28.182]  I'm not impressed with credentials.
[01:03:29.085 --> 01:03:31.387]  I always do my own research.
[01:03:31.387 --> 01:03:32.948]  You should do your own research.
[01:03:32.948 --> 01:03:35.810]  You have the capability of doing your own research.
[01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:39.352]  And if something happens to your family, you're ultimately responsible.
[01:03:39.352 --> 01:03:45.997]  Whether you got the vaccine or whether you didn't get the vaccine is something that you need to look at.
[01:03:45.997 --> 01:03:50.259]  You need to look at the information and you need to decide whether you're going to do that or not.
[01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:53.402]  And we need to have the freedom and the respect
[01:03:54.488 --> 01:04:00.102]  in our government and in our society for people to make those kinds of decisions and yet we see again another
[01:04:01.075 --> 01:04:05.337]  Another article from the Wall Street Journal saying, hey, doctors need to be presumptive.
[01:04:05.337 --> 01:04:07.438]  In other words, they need to browbeat the parents.
[01:04:07.438 --> 01:04:15.961]  They found that if they really browbeat the parents at the schools, if the pediatricians do it, then they can get a very high compliance rate.
[01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:23.064]  But they still have that 1 out of 10, that 1 out of 12 that says, no, I've done my research.
[01:04:23.064 --> 01:04:24.104]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:04:24.104 --> 01:04:26.325]  So what's the answer to that?
[01:04:26.325 --> 01:04:27.826]  We're going to do it by force.
[01:04:28.809 --> 01:04:33.410]  If we can't convince you, if we can't lie to you, we're going to do it by force.
[01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:34.831]  They say, hey, we've got to counter.
[01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:37.112]  This is a quote from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:04:37.112 --> 01:04:43.674]  Pediatricians need to step up their game to counter a spigot of unscientific anti-vaccine material distributed over the Internet.
[01:04:43.674 --> 01:04:46.655]  Hey, we've looked at the history of this.
[01:04:46.655 --> 01:04:48.215]  We know what happened 40 years ago.
[01:04:48.215 --> 01:04:50.236]  We know what you're putting in the vaccines.
[01:04:50.236 --> 01:04:52.156]  It's not simply a vaccine.
[01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:52.556]  Stay with us.
[01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:54.197]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:03.154]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:03.154 --> 01:05:07.418]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:07.418 --> 01:05:09.199]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:09.199 --> 01:05:17.066]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:17.066 --> 01:05:18.207]  But for how long?
[01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:24.852]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:24.852 --> 01:05:27.675]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:05:29.002 --> 01:05:32.503]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:32.503 --> 01:05:40.764]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:40.764 --> 01:05:46.186]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:46.186 --> 01:05:48.706]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:05:48.706 --> 01:05:50.807]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:06:05.874 --> 01:06:07.095]  Security alert.
[01:06:07.095 --> 01:06:09.097]  This is Homeland Security.

[01:06:12.679 --> 01:06:17.683]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:17.683 --> 01:06:18.724]  Prime Directive.
[01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:20.285]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.285 --> 01:06:23.127]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:23.127 --> 01:06:26.369]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:26.369 --> 01:06:28.531]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:30.172]  People are assaulting us.
[01:06:30.172 --> 01:06:32.333]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:32.333 --> 01:06:34.954]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:34.954 --> 01:06:39.015]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:46.939]  Imperative.
[01:06:46.939 --> 01:06:48.980]  Destroy criminalized TV.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:53.662]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:53.662 --> 01:06:55.042]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:55.783]  You can feel it.
[01:06:58.519 --> 01:07:05.721]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:08:04.468 --> 01:08:07.188]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:14.232]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:14.232 --> 01:08:15.433]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:08:15.433 --> 01:08:19.357]  Joining me in this segment is Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:08:19.357 --> 01:08:26.885]  Now in the last hour, I didn't plug, we have several specials at the InfoWarsLife.com store.
[01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:31.110]  One of those right now involves an introductory special of Ancient Defense.
[01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:33.831]  That's our new herbal immunity formula.
[01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:40.773]  If you buy two survival shield, nascent iodine, you get one bottle of ancient defense herbal immunity for free.
[01:08:40.773 --> 01:08:46.174]  That's a $20 savings and you'll find that on InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:46.174 --> 01:08:49.475]  Now joining us from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:08:49.475 --> 01:08:52.196]  Paul, there's a story that we talked about a little bit yesterday.
[01:08:52.196 --> 01:08:55.077]  You've got a full article up on it today about Samsung.
[01:08:55.757 --> 01:09:00.581]  Talking about how they're going to turn over your conversations to third parties.
[01:09:00.581 --> 01:09:01.842]  That's kind of left open-ended.
[01:09:01.842 --> 01:09:06.806]  But again, it kind of ties in what we've been talking about all day and that is consent.
[01:09:06.806 --> 01:09:13.272]  Sometimes they put the consent in the fine print and you just click a little box there and they start sharing your information.
[01:09:13.272 --> 01:09:18.616]  We've seen this happen with iPhone apps, with computer programs, but especially with phone apps.
[01:09:18.616 --> 01:09:21.378]  Now they're doing it with your television set and of course
[01:09:22.219 --> 01:09:25.440]  Just so that you can have the convenience of voice recognition.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.741]  Presumably it works.
[01:09:26.741 --> 01:09:27.681]  I don't even know if it works.
[01:09:27.681 --> 01:09:33.303]  But they are listening and grabbing your information and sharing it with other people.
[01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:34.084]  Well, yeah, David.
[01:09:34.084 --> 01:09:37.365]  I mean, the road to serfdom is paved with convenience.
[01:09:37.365 --> 01:09:40.226]  And there's been an update on this Samsung story today.
[01:09:40.976 --> 01:09:45.940]  Which is odd, you know, because we first reported this three months ago in November.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:48.743]  It was also reported by Salon.com.
[01:09:48.743 --> 01:09:52.506]  Their writer said he was terrified of his TV at the time.
[01:09:52.506 --> 01:09:56.529]  But why has it taken three months for this now to become a viral story?
[01:09:56.529 --> 01:10:02.174]  It's basically the top news story across a ton of different mainstream media websites today.
[01:10:02.174 --> 01:10:06.518]  And it stems from Samsung's global privacy policy.
[01:10:07.296 --> 01:10:20.949]  Which states, please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of voice recognition.
[01:10:20.949 --> 01:10:28.756]  So they're basically admitting that the voice recognition program, which people use to download content over the internet to their televisions,
[01:10:29.316 --> 01:10:30.958]  It's only now that it's gone big, it's gone viral.
[01:10:43.527 --> 01:11:00.374]  That the company has been forced to respond and they said that they admitted that if consumers gave permission for the voice recognition feature to be activated, their words would be, quote, sent to a server which searches for the requested content and returns the desired content to the TV.
[01:11:01.261 --> 01:11:21.718]  So not only their words in terms of requesting what program they want on their television, but all private conversations that you have in your living room if you own a Samsung TV and have activated this option, which is basically the reason why people buy these smart TVs in the first place, is being uploaded to the internet.
[01:11:21.718 --> 01:11:24.080]  So again, it's another massive privacy scandal.
[01:11:25.057 --> 01:11:30.559]  And we've seen it with other companies that have basically got no press attention when they're doing the same thing.
[01:11:30.559 --> 01:11:44.043]  Microsoft Kinect, two years ago, gamers complained that Microsoft Kinect was monitoring their Skype calls and then banning their uploaded videos of themselves playing video games because they used obscenity.
[01:11:44.603 --> 01:12:06.871]  In the video uploads, but then Microsoft Connect users complained that they had not even uploaded any videos and yet they were getting account bans for using obscenities both within video games and Skype calls, suggesting that Microsoft was actually recording and listening to Skype conversations, private Skype conversations for obscenities.
[01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:10.312]  And as we mentioned yesterday, people who play, for example,
[01:12:11.238 --> 01:12:19.941]  Football management simulation games who shouted out obscenity swear words during the game also had account bans placed on them.
[01:12:19.941 --> 01:12:36.847]  So this is not just Samsung, this is a ton of different companies, and this is the danger of the Internet of Things, where every device in your household is connected to the Internet, potentially acting as a surveillance bug, as former CIA Director General David Petraeus
[01:12:37.447 --> 01:12:41.349]  Hailed back in that Wired Magazine article a few years ago.
[01:12:41.349 --> 01:12:43.270]  Oh yeah, this has been going on for a very long time.
[01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:58.696]  You point out that in this particular case, in the case of the Samsung TV, we reported on that back in November, and yet we know this is happening with computer monitors, that the NSA can put something on your computer to listen to and monitor what you're doing.
[01:12:58.696 --> 01:13:00.897]  That's all been revealed with Snowden.
[01:13:01.397 --> 01:13:07.460]  Alex was talking about that, you were talking about that well before we got the revelations from the Snowden document leaks.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:17.226]  This is something that is pervasive and as Petraeus was bragging about it and saying we're going to listen to you through your appliances, through your dishwasher or whatever with this Internet of Things.
[01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:24.030]  Paul, what concerns me so much is that this Internet of Things is being extended to transportation.
[01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:37.925]  And we should all remember that the very first DARPA contest that was put out there, even before they started the robotics contest, we all saw the Atlas robot and these other robots last year.
[01:13:38.752 --> 01:13:46.122]  Well, before that, ten years ago, their very first DARPA competition was a self-driving car.
[01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:47.183]  It was the U.S.
[01:13:47.183 --> 01:13:55.173]  military, Eisenhower, who wanted to put in an interstate system, primarily so that it could be used by the military whenever they had a need to.
[01:13:55.954 --> 01:14:08.439]  And it was Eisenhower who saw the Autobahn in Germany that wanted to replicate it here, primarily for military purposes, because it's very important for them to have control over transportation as a chokehold.
[01:14:08.439 --> 01:14:18.923]  And that's something that really concerns me, is the loss of the ability to anonymously travel without the government watching everywhere that you go, but also the
[01:14:20.223 --> 01:14:41.835]  Danger that it exposes us to if somebody hacks into these self-driving cars or actually which they should say that they are Computer-controlled and government driven because that's what's going to happen they're going to limit where when and how you can drive and The goal as Google and uber and many of these people have said the goal is just to take away private ownership of cars So that's the next thing.
[01:14:41.835 --> 01:14:46.358]  It's not just watching you but it is controlling where you're even able to go and
[01:14:47.805 --> 01:14:59.928]  Yeah, and we had the article a couple of weeks back, the UK government's official transportation policy going forward over the next three decades that they're developing with Ofcom, which controls all the communications in Britain.
[01:15:00.632 --> 01:15:18.498]  Directs them to install black boxes in all cars, and this is also being introduced in other European countries as well as Japan, whereby it would be run by a Wi-Fi signal to, quote, solve traffic congestion and reduce global warming, reduce CO2 footprints.
[01:15:18.498 --> 01:15:25.761]  They would remotely control people's cars to slow down so as to reduce the chance of traffic jams, of course.
[01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:36.895]  If they have control of that, they have control of your basic right to mobility, because they could withdraw permission for you to even start the car in the first place.
[01:15:36.895 --> 01:15:42.397]  So that's the big problem with the Internet of Things as it relates to transportation going forward.
[01:15:42.737 --> 01:15:46.039]  And they're even talking about that as being part of the Internet of Things.
[01:15:46.039 --> 01:15:49.601]  Of course, it raises security issues for people.
[01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:52.742]  Malicious hackers could cause car crashes.
[01:15:52.742 --> 01:15:59.206]  You could have governments could single out particular individuals and of course they could have a malfunction.
[01:15:59.206 --> 01:16:10.652]  We should all remember that all these cases that we've had in recent past of various automobile manufacturers who had uncontrolled acceleration that left people dead or crippled in many instances.
[01:16:10.652 --> 01:16:11.893]  You didn't hear much about that.
[01:16:12.233 --> 01:16:12.433]  I think?
[01:16:27.811 --> 01:16:30.092]  Now you're physically in that crash.
[01:16:30.092 --> 01:16:31.713]  But of course they will cover that up.
[01:16:31.713 --> 01:16:35.595]  They will compensate the victims under condition that they don't talk about that.
[01:16:35.595 --> 01:16:43.538]  So they be able to maintain this illusion that all the people that are dying from accidents from careless drivers, that'll all be gone.
[01:16:43.538 --> 01:16:47.000]  Of course we'll have people who will be dying then from software errors.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.160]  That's the thing that concerns me.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:53.343]  But even more so, Paul, is the fact that they're going to have control over our movement.
[01:16:53.343 --> 01:16:53.683]  And this is
[01:16:54.403 --> 01:16:56.104]  This affects a lot of things.
[01:16:56.104 --> 01:17:04.967]  This affects the Agenda 21 example, where they restrict you to certain urban centers and keep you out of the rest of the country.
[01:17:04.967 --> 01:17:14.611]  This is a very pervasive total control regime, and when they do it with transportation, that's when they can exercise total physical control.
[01:17:14.611 --> 01:17:23.054]  Yeah, and the challenge we've got, David, is to get young people irate and angry about this, because I was looking at some of the polls beforehand on
[01:17:23.977 --> 01:17:28.043]  How young people view surveillance because we talk about this again and again.
[01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:32.790]  They they appear to be quite happy to sacrifice privacy for convenience.
[01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:36.274]  They've grown up in the Internet age where everything is on demand.
[01:17:36.274 --> 01:17:39.399]  Everything is instant and they're willing to sacrifice that.
[01:17:39.799 --> 01:17:43.804]  And they don't really seem to care about privacy rights and where that's heading.
[01:17:43.804 --> 01:17:55.559]  So there was a Pew Research Center poll not too long ago which found that NSA spying receives more support from people under 30 years old than any other age group.
[01:17:56.039 --> 01:18:09.563]  So people aged 18 to 29 approved of the NSA spying program, this was after the Snowden revelations, at a rate of 61% compared to just 40% from the 65 and older crowd.
[01:18:09.563 --> 01:18:11.903]  And that was a Pew Research Center poll.
[01:18:11.903 --> 01:18:17.505]  So, you know, even people on the left like Noam Chomsky have looked at this and concluded that
[01:18:18.368 --> 01:18:19.390]  You know, why is this?
[01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:23.635]  Why do young people so willingly sacrifice privacy for convenience?
[01:18:23.635 --> 01:18:27.481]  Why do they not seem to be so put off by government surveillance?
[01:18:27.481 --> 01:18:35.372]  And he points out that the whole exhibitionist nature of the internet culture, with social media and specifically Facebook,
[01:18:35.892 --> 01:18:43.457]  Has made people so much more comfortable with the idea that everything they do is going to be public, no matter what it is.
[01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:56.386]  Which comes back to the Samsung thing and what John McCain said after the Don Sterling revelations, that every private conversation you have, you should consider that to be on the record, to be open to surveillance.
[01:18:56.906 --> 01:19:01.868]  As Julian Assange said, it's like Facebook and Twitter is like having all your friends wearing a wire.
[01:19:01.868 --> 01:19:14.214]  But I think it's no coincidence, Paul, that the very first reality show, which it's almost as if the younger generation believes that they're in a constant reality show, that if everybody is watching everything that they do, that somehow that makes them a celebrity.
[01:19:14.214 --> 01:19:17.816]  The very first one of those shows was called, of course, Big Brother.
[01:19:18.604 --> 01:19:20.245]  I don't think that's any coincidence.
[01:19:20.245 --> 01:19:41.322]  One of the things you're talking about, how they love social network, they're going to be perfectly happy to have their movement completely controlled and limited by the government if they'll be able to sit in their little bubble of a car without a steering wheel, without any brakes, and just sit there with their face on social media, with their face in Facebook, and tweeting out where they're going.
[01:19:41.482 --> 01:19:43.123]  That's where the next generation is going.
[01:19:43.123 --> 01:19:44.783]  That's the challenge before us.
[01:19:44.783 --> 01:19:46.844]  And of course, the schools are a large part of that.
[01:19:46.844 --> 01:19:47.184]  Stay with us.
[01:19:47.184 --> 01:19:49.125]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.

[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:06.502]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:21:06.502 --> 01:21:14.325]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:14.605 --> 01:21:19.129]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:21:19.129 --> 01:21:23.113]  Bipatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:23.113 --> 01:21:29.078]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:29.078 --> 01:21:34.343]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach, and that's why I stock my pantry.

[01:21:58.067 --> 01:22:00.969]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[01:22:00.969 --> 01:22:04.511]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:22:04.511 --> 01:22:06.653]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:22:06.653 --> 01:22:15.959]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:22:15.959 --> 01:22:21.963]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:59.033]  Quantitative easing.
[01:22:59.033 --> 01:23:01.135]  Unemployment at depression levels.
[01:23:01.135 --> 01:23:03.196]  Europe financial system falling apart.
[01:23:03.196 --> 01:23:04.457]  China getting out of U.S.
[01:23:04.457 --> 01:23:05.218]  Treasuries.
[01:23:05.218 --> 01:23:12.584]  At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at $11 trillion, gold trading around $850 per ounce.
[01:23:12.584 --> 01:23:19.410]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1,600 per ounce.
[01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:22.252]  The $20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[01:23:22.492 --> 01:23:26.614]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[01:23:26.614 --> 01:23:29.295]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[01:23:29.295 --> 01:23:35.078]  A hundred years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your own gold standard.
[01:23:35.078 --> 01:23:36.879]  Don't be fooled with paper promises.

[01:24:12.637 --> 01:24:15.779]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:15.779 --> 01:24:17.700]  I'm your host today, David Knight.
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:20.042]  Joined from the UK with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:24:20.042 --> 01:24:27.207]  And Paul, just before the break, we were talking about how passive the younger generation is towards social media.
[01:24:27.207 --> 01:24:28.908]  We had to cut it short to go the break.
[01:24:28.908 --> 01:24:30.449]  Go ahead and continue with what you were going to say.
[01:24:31.621 --> 01:24:40.966]  Yeah, I was just going to make the point that, you know, on the flip side of that argument, young people are now so energised about healthy lifestyles and eating well and food.
[01:24:40.966 --> 01:24:45.668]  We saw the recent victory with the Food Babe getting the preservative out of the cereals.
[01:24:45.668 --> 01:24:46.948]  That was a massive victory.
[01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:52.051]  They instantly had to respond to that petition and remove the preservative from cereals.
[01:24:52.051 --> 01:24:56.233]  And we're having numerous victories on the health front, driven mainly by young people.
[01:24:56.753 --> 01:25:06.276]  So the question I have is, you know, why are larger numbers of people willing to change their habits, their lifestyles and spend more money on what they eat and their health?
[01:25:06.276 --> 01:25:12.478]  Why are they more likely to want to reassert more control over their health than they are their privacy rights?
[01:25:12.478 --> 01:25:16.819]  And again, it goes back to this, this problem about Facebook and social media where
[01:25:17.495 --> 01:25:29.709]  You know, it promotes mindless content over serious content, so it encourages people to post more and more private information about themselves, and then that normalizes the whole process.
[01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:31.231]  They've actually done studies whereby...
[01:25:32.116 --> 01:25:48.740]  You know, narcissism is now through the roof and people's brains are actually becoming more infantile because of this reward they get from the likes, from the comments on Facebook when they post mindless photographs of themselves or reveal private information about themselves.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:58.062]  So, whereas in the past that wouldn't be rewarded, now it's being socially rewarded by the very basic algorithm of how Facebook works.
[01:25:58.522 --> 01:26:05.613]  So, you know, I could post a serious article or a video and it will get four shares and seven comments.
[01:26:05.613 --> 01:26:10.900]  I can post a comment, as I did the other day, saying, what's your favorite mobster movie?
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.705]  And within five minutes, it's got 50 comments.
[01:26:14.185 --> 01:26:27.136]  So Facebook, their algorithm works to promote mindless content, so that encourages people to be more mindless, to be more infantile and narcissistic about how they relate with Facebook, and then they get rewarded for that.
[01:26:27.136 --> 01:26:39.467]  So that's the challenge that we have to overcome in getting people concerned about privacy and scaling back this idea that sharing every facet of your private life is somehow normal and should be encouraged, because it shouldn't.
[01:26:40.293 --> 01:26:41.494]  Well, it's bread and circuses.
[01:26:41.494 --> 01:26:47.557]  I mean, that's really what's behind so much of this, and certainly that's behind what's going on with the Samsung television as well.
[01:26:47.557 --> 01:26:53.360]  People don't care that somebody is listening to every single word and is being transmitted to a third party.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.822]  All the conversations, the private conversations happening in their living room, they really don't care that they got a Big Brother box there.
[01:26:58.822 --> 01:27:04.625]  And as we mentioned yesterday in the Snowden documents that came out in Germany late last spring,
[01:27:06.486 --> 01:27:12.290]  The NSA was bragging about how they had enacted Big Brother using the iPhone.
[01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:17.834]  And laughing at Americans and people all over the world who would line up to pay for their own Big Brother device.
[01:27:17.834 --> 01:27:20.056]  And that certainly is what the Samsung device is.
[01:27:20.056 --> 01:27:24.439]  But it's all about convenience, it's about entertainment, it's about bread and circuses.
[01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:28.602]  That's the way they've always used, they've always controlled the mass.
[01:27:29.462 --> 01:27:32.424]  Public, and that's the way they're doing it now.
[01:27:32.424 --> 01:27:35.406]  We're going to take some calls in the next segment with Paul.
[01:27:35.406 --> 01:27:39.589]  The number, if you want to call in, is 800-259-9231.
[01:27:39.589 --> 01:27:40.129]  Again, that's 800-259-9231.
[01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:45.993]  Paul, I want to go to another story that you put up today, kind of a curious story.
[01:27:45.993 --> 01:27:48.475]  I haven't had time to see the video.
[01:27:48.475 --> 01:27:52.978]  Maybe you could kind of walk us through this hoax, you ask.
[01:27:52.978 --> 01:27:57.100]  There's a bizarre satanic ritual being described by children in a video.
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:57.761]  Tell us about that.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:02.324]  Yeah, this is a chilling video, whether it's a hoax or not.
[01:28:02.324 --> 01:28:04.807]  I mean, it's gone completely viral over the weekend.
[01:28:04.807 --> 01:28:06.729]  It's got over a thousand comments on Reddit.
[01:28:06.729 --> 01:28:10.233]  It's got 200,000 views on the original YouTube video.
[01:28:10.233 --> 01:28:12.195]  And it's basically two young children...
[01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:29.731]  Describing how they were allegedly sexually abused and forced to partake in bizarre satanic baby sacrifice rituals by all these police headteachers and other local officials in an area of London.
[01:28:30.311 --> 01:28:37.358]  There are literally 20 videos of these children on the internet describing in detail what they were put through.
[01:28:37.358 --> 01:28:41.802]  It's not substantiated other than the claims that they're making.
[01:28:41.802 --> 01:28:47.046]  A lot of people have watched the video and said they're being coached by their parents to say these things.
[01:28:47.046 --> 01:28:51.911]  They're saying that this is just to demonize the father in a custody battle.
[01:28:51.911 --> 01:28:54.353]  But the fact that it's gone so viral over the weekend
[01:28:55.268 --> 01:29:01.011]  Means that it needs to be addressed by the relevant authorities because it's becoming a huge story.
[01:29:01.011 --> 01:29:09.556]  So I merely drew attention to it and then made the point that unfortunately a lot of these allegations are now proving to be true in different areas.
[01:29:09.556 --> 01:29:12.057]  We've got the Westminster paedophile scandal.
[01:29:12.057 --> 01:29:15.079]  Of course, we have the Jimmy Savile scandal where a lot of these
[01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:21.623]  Satanic rituals are actually alleged to have taken place by the victims and a lot of that is now coming true.
[01:29:21.623 --> 01:29:25.585]  So God only hopes that it's a hoax because it's a very disturbing video.
[01:29:25.585 --> 01:29:30.629]  But I thought it was important to draw attention to it simply because of the traction it's got, which is massive.
[01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:37.093]  And of course that Jimmy Savola case, that was covered up multiple times by Scotland Yard.
[01:29:37.093 --> 01:29:38.874]  They shut down that investigation from higher up.
[01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:39.915]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:29:39.915 --> 01:29:40.855]  If you want to talk to Paul, 800-259-9231.
[01:29:48.688 --> 01:29:50.091]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.091 --> 01:29:52.637]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:55.322]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.781]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:30:02.781 --> 01:30:06.283]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:30:06.283 --> 01:30:12.365]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:13.746]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:30:13.746 --> 01:30:15.867]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:30:15.967 --> 01:30:17.547]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:30:17.547 --> 01:30:22.329]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:30:22.329 --> 01:30:26.910]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:29.551]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[01:31:33.230 --> 01:31:37.513]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:37.513 --> 01:31:39.294]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:39.294 --> 01:31:47.139]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:47.139 --> 01:31:48.280]  But for how long?

[01:32:45.142 --> 01:32:50.286]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[01:33:03.092 --> 01:33:04.977]  We are on the march.
[01:33:04.977 --> 01:33:08.145]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:08.145 --> 01:33:11.854]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:18.581 --> 01:33:19.802]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.802 --> 01:33:20.943]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:33:20.943 --> 01:33:23.946]  We have Paul Joseph Watson on the line with us from the UK.
[01:33:23.946 --> 01:33:28.971]  We have some callers who are lined up to ask Paul some questions.
[01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:33.896]  Before we go back to Paul, though, I want to let you know that we have a February special at Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:34.757 --> 01:33:49.788]  It is Super Male and Female Vitality, a unique formula, completely free of GMOs, harmful additives, gluten, and it's made in the USA, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[01:34:01.537 --> 01:34:10.403]  Now, also in the next hour, we're going to be joined by Dr. John Dunn, a physician of 44 years, an attorney for 36 years.
[01:34:10.403 --> 01:34:14.586]  He specializes in the juncture of science and ethics.
[01:34:14.586 --> 01:34:20.530]  Particularly, we're going to be talking about yet another case we see from the EPA of human experimentations.
[01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:27.575]  We're going to talk about the medical as well as the ethical issues of that with Dr. John Dunn from JunkScience.com.
[01:34:28.375 --> 01:34:29.416]  That's where he is an editor.
[01:34:29.416 --> 01:34:35.600]  Of course, he's involved as a policy and science advisor for a number of institutions.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:40.324]  But he's going to be talking to us about yet another case of human experimentation by the EPA.
[01:34:40.324 --> 01:34:41.504]  Because you know what?
[01:34:41.504 --> 01:34:44.727]  Your informed consent doesn't matter anymore.
[01:34:45.347 --> 01:34:57.514]  That's why we got everybody screaming at the top of their lungs from both the left and the right, Fox News to CNN to C-SPAN, not C-SPAN, CNBC I should say, and MSNBC.
[01:34:57.514 --> 01:35:09.962]  They're all saying, hey, just shut up and do what the government tells you because they've been to school and they know the names of all the body parts, inside of your kid even, even the parts that are inside.
[01:35:10.802 --> 01:35:12.543]  Let's go to some of your calls.
[01:35:12.543 --> 01:35:14.204]  You had some questions for Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:35:14.204 --> 01:35:16.605]  Let's go to Casey in Louisiana.
[01:35:16.605 --> 01:35:18.886]  Casey.
[01:35:18.886 --> 01:35:20.226]  How's it going, guys?
[01:35:20.226 --> 01:35:20.647]  Doing good.
[01:35:20.647 --> 01:35:22.667]  What's your question?
[01:35:22.667 --> 01:35:23.788]  Really, it was a comment.
[01:35:23.788 --> 01:35:33.832]  I was really calling to agree with him whenever he mentioned about Facebook, how you can post something mindless and you get many hits versus posting something for real.
[01:35:33.832 --> 01:35:39.715]  I've shared your articles and I've shared different things for years with InfoWars and other stuff I find and get no comment.
[01:35:40.307 --> 01:35:40.507]  Yeah.
[01:35:40.507 --> 01:35:40.647]  Yeah.
[01:36:09.007 --> 01:36:14.511]  Absolutely.
[01:36:14.511 --> 01:36:16.753]  You know, we were just talking with Paul.
[01:36:16.753 --> 01:36:27.401]  I'll let Paul comment on this, but one of the cars that was offered at the Consumer Electronics Show, of course, this year, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, is all about self-driving cars.
[01:36:27.401 --> 01:36:32.985]  And of course, the one that was probably the most complete was the Mercedes that was rolled out.
[01:36:33.385 --> 01:36:46.408]  And one of the things that they had were these large virtual displays on the door so that you could, instead of looking out the window, you could look at this display that had cameras showing you views of the outside.
[01:36:46.408 --> 01:36:47.908]  And it's like, wow.
[01:36:47.908 --> 01:36:52.649]  I remember when we just used to look out the windows and it was this real 3D reality.
[01:36:52.649 --> 01:36:54.150]  It wasn't virtual reality.
[01:36:54.150 --> 01:36:56.830]  I mean, to me that just seems incredibly silly.
[01:36:56.830 --> 01:37:00.531]  Is that the same kind of car that Michael Hastings was driving?
[01:37:01.196 --> 01:37:05.519]  Uh, well, it's a little bit, it's their, their self-driving car they're going to introduce in a few years.
[01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:08.521]  But yeah, Mercedes has been leading the forefront.
[01:37:08.521 --> 01:37:17.447]  That's why they have the most complete self-driving cars at the moment, because they've been adding these systems gradually to the car to assist you in driving.
[01:37:17.447 --> 01:37:21.930]  But of course, those systems, even at this point, can easily be hacked.
[01:37:21.930 --> 01:37:29.895]  Richard Clark, former advisor, Homeland Security and Security Issues, pointed that out during the Michael Hastings
[01:37:31.316 --> 01:37:33.718]  Inquiry said, hey, we've done this before.
[01:37:33.718 --> 01:37:34.819]  We've hacked cars before.
[01:37:34.819 --> 01:37:37.802]  We can make them crash just by hacking into the systems.
[01:37:37.802 --> 01:37:40.684]  So what are they going to do when they take over complete control of your car?
[01:37:40.684 --> 01:37:42.626]  Paul, did you have a comment?
[01:37:42.626 --> 01:37:47.530]  Yeah, just on Facebook, you know, people say, why don't you just delete your Facebook account?
[01:37:47.530 --> 01:37:49.171]  Well, that's where the audience is.
[01:37:49.171 --> 01:37:53.675]  You know, Facebook still has five times the amount of users compared to Twitter.
[01:37:53.675 --> 01:37:57.298]  So if you actually want to try and reach anybody, that's not really a solution.
[01:37:57.298 --> 01:37:58.519]  What's interesting to me is
[01:37:59.279 --> 01:38:01.741]  Um, there's a story out of the AP today.
[01:38:01.741 --> 01:38:06.364]  Robbery suspects say Facebook posts about inheriting jewelry made them target home.
[01:38:06.364 --> 01:38:15.070]  So somebody posted the fact that they just inherited a bunch of jewelry, and then men wearing ski masks arrived shortly afterwards.
[01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:19.733]  So yeah, the fact that people are posting pictures of their children is completely insane.
[01:38:19.733 --> 01:38:23.175]  I can't even imagine why you would entertain that in the first place.
[01:38:23.175 --> 01:38:27.638]  But for people using it to spread information, it's a very good tool, and that's why we use it.
[01:38:27.638 --> 01:38:28.679]  But as the caller said,
[01:38:29.319 --> 01:38:33.662]  Facebook deliberately relegates anything serious.
[01:38:33.662 --> 01:38:39.385]  They promote mindless stuff about people, you know, falling over, having accidents, funny stuff like that.
[01:38:39.385 --> 01:38:42.327]  And anything with a link in it basically gets relegated.
[01:38:42.327 --> 01:38:44.148]  You get very few comments or shares.
[01:38:44.148 --> 01:38:51.833]  So it's a constant battle because they're constantly changing their algorithm to relegate serious content and now bringing in censorship
[01:38:52.313 --> 01:39:03.681]  Where committed groups of political agitators can claim that something's a hoax if they merely disagree with it and then that post gets relegated so less people see it.
[01:39:03.681 --> 01:39:14.229]  So it's a constant battle with Facebook to try and get around their algorithm which is, you know, determined to obfuscate and relegate any serious news.
[01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.889]  Thanks Casey.
[01:39:14.889 --> 01:39:16.931]  Let's go to Keith in Michigan.
[01:39:16.931 --> 01:39:18.612]  Keith, you said you had a comment for Paul.
[01:39:18.612 --> 01:39:18.872]  Go ahead.
[01:39:22.261 --> 01:39:22.901]  Are you there?
[01:39:22.901 --> 01:39:23.542]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:39:23.542 --> 01:39:26.143]  You're on.
[01:39:26.143 --> 01:39:34.406]  Well, I just wanted to say that I've been listening since, uh, like 2000 and I love the show and I just kind of wanted to make a comment.
[01:39:34.406 --> 01:39:42.209]  I just pulled out some old albums, uh, from the seventies and I've got a Steppenwolf album with the song called monster.
[01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:45.530]  And it just reminds me, it's just so much about what we're talking about.
[01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:46.651]  Monster on the loose.
[01:39:47.423 --> 01:39:51.570]  It's got her head into a noose and it just sits there watching us.
[01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:53.032]  It's like Big Brother.
[01:39:53.032 --> 01:39:58.761]  And I just thought I would just pass that on, that song Monster by Steppenwolf.
[01:39:58.761 --> 01:39:59.422]  Any comment, Paul?
[01:40:01.263 --> 01:40:13.454]  I'm not a fan of Steppenwolf personally, but yeah, this whole idea about Big Brother in the past being something to be feared, now it's kind of being incorporated into the culture as something trendy, like you said with the Big Brother reality show.
[01:40:13.454 --> 01:40:16.077]  You know, maybe Big Brother's our friend now.
[01:40:16.077 --> 01:40:20.141]  Well I'll tell you what, I'm not a big Steppenwolf fan, but I like... Sorry?
[01:40:20.947 --> 01:40:21.367]  Go ahead.
[01:40:21.367 --> 01:40:23.229]  Take a listen to that song.
[01:40:23.229 --> 01:40:27.572]  And it's kind of like in the, you know, I don't know if you remember the song, Born to be Wild.
[01:40:27.572 --> 01:40:28.712]  That's what I was going to say.
[01:40:28.712 --> 01:40:29.653]  I like that.
[01:40:29.653 --> 01:40:31.294]  That's a great driving song.
[01:40:31.294 --> 01:40:31.614]  Thanks.
[01:40:31.614 --> 01:40:33.776]  Let's go to Mike in Georgia.
[01:40:33.776 --> 01:40:36.818]  Mike, you said you had a question for Paul?
[01:40:36.818 --> 01:40:41.421]  Yeah, I guess it's really more just about the info war as a whole.
[01:40:41.421 --> 01:40:44.903]  And so I've been pretty awake for two years now.
[01:40:44.903 --> 01:40:47.805]  And the thing that I noticed is if you listen to this show and others,
[01:40:49.389 --> 01:40:52.511]  You'll hear something, but you gotta go research it afterwards.
[01:40:52.511 --> 01:41:00.936]  You can't just say, oh yeah, I heard this is linked to this, and then you just say it and spout it off, and you're actually hurting the info war at that point.
[01:41:00.936 --> 01:41:08.701]  If someone says something and it sounds bombastic, when you have free time, get on the internet and read about it.
[01:41:08.701 --> 01:41:17.707]  You know, the thing to me that I've been learning, and I don't know how to really approach this, because obviously you want people on your side, but you want informed people on your side, is
[01:41:18.450 --> 01:41:21.173]  The, like, vaccinations and autism.
[01:41:21.173 --> 01:41:22.715]  Like, I haven't read the reports on it.
[01:41:22.715 --> 01:41:27.199]  I know that it's a thing, but if I haven't read about it, I can't say anything about it.
[01:41:27.199 --> 01:41:31.364]  What I can say is, the inserts say all these things, so I know that to be a fact.
[01:41:32.611 --> 01:41:43.483]  So I really just don't know how to approach this and wake people up and get them to actually research what they're hearing on these shows and not just repeat it.
[01:41:43.483 --> 01:41:52.914]  I'll let Paul comment on that, but my comment first of all would be that one of the best ways to wake people up if they haven't heard anything other than mainstream news, one of the best ways to wake them up
[01:41:53.434 --> 01:41:54.616]  Is with documentaries.
[01:41:54.616 --> 01:41:57.359]  Alex has got a lot of documentaries.
[01:41:57.359 --> 01:41:59.141]  Most of them you'll find on YouTube.
[01:41:59.141 --> 01:42:09.674]  Of course, if you get a Prison Planet TV subscription, you can get all the documentaries there, you can share it with people, and then you get the nightly news each night and they can see the application of
[01:42:10.635 --> 01:42:27.994]  Those principles what we understand about the long-term trends that Alex explains in detail in the documentaries you can see that as it's happening daily in the news so you can put those two things together to get a bigger picture but I think documentaries are one of the best ways to wake people up to the fact that they've been lied because
[01:42:28.795 --> 01:42:38.565]  You can't really, in a news broadcast or radio program, you can't really go into sufficient depth to explain this to somebody if they haven't seen it before.
[01:42:38.565 --> 01:42:46.894]  Of course, the articles that Paul and others put up on Infowars.com, they back up what they've got there with links to, in most cases, mainstream media.
[01:42:46.894 --> 01:42:49.496]  It's like, look, the New York Times has pointed this out.
[01:42:49.496 --> 01:42:50.738]  And so they can go to us.
[01:42:52.159 --> 01:42:56.822]  Information sources that they perhaps trust because they've heard them a lot.
[01:42:56.822 --> 01:43:00.504]  And they can see that they're saying the same thing, but it doesn't get much airplay.
[01:43:00.504 --> 01:43:02.325]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:43:02.325 --> 01:43:05.526]  Yeah, well, I mean, people have to take responsibility.
[01:43:05.526 --> 01:43:10.709]  We've never had greater access to information in the history of mankind.
[01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:18.033]  So if you're pointing out there's issues to people and they're not following up on it, they're not doing their own research, then that's really not your fault.
[01:43:18.033 --> 01:43:20.835]  You could look at it through a more selfish paradigm where you think
[01:43:21.515 --> 01:43:36.305]  If I research this information and it turns out to be accurate and it's confirmed and I apply it to my life, you know, in the arena of, you know, finance, health, civil liberties, any of those contexts, then that helps you live a better, more empowered, more free life.
[01:43:36.305 --> 01:43:40.088]  If other people refuse to do that, there's no excuse for them anymore.
[01:43:40.088 --> 01:43:41.368]  The information's right there.
[01:43:41.368 --> 01:43:43.750]  Everybody's got direct access for it.
[01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:47.212]  So from that, through that prism, it's really their responsibility.
[01:43:47.212 --> 01:43:48.493]  It's not on your head anymore.
[01:43:48.493 --> 01:43:50.875]  If they fail to do it, then it's their own fault.
[01:43:51.555 --> 01:43:53.036]  And of course, I would agree with that.
[01:43:53.036 --> 01:44:06.542]  I would say that maybe if the people who support vaccines, you think that regardless of what's in the vaccine, you ought to just shut up and listen to the people with credentials, the people in authority, do what they tell you to do and not question it.
[01:44:06.542 --> 01:44:09.604]  Maybe we could just say, well, we'll wait and see who wins the Darwin Award.
[01:44:09.604 --> 01:44:13.586]  You think that this is something that's dangerous?
[01:44:13.586 --> 01:44:14.426]  That's not dangerous?
[01:44:14.426 --> 01:44:15.407]  I think it's something that is.
[01:44:15.407 --> 01:44:16.127]  Let's just wait and see.
[01:44:16.127 --> 01:44:17.828]  But they're not content to do that.
[01:44:18.288 --> 01:44:26.635]  I think that's one of the reasons we have to engage them, because not only are they not content to do their own research, but they want to force their ignorance on other people.
[01:44:26.635 --> 01:44:35.663]  They want to destroy our fundamental human rights, our civil liberties, our legal structure, our Constitution, and force us to do things without our consent.
[01:44:35.663 --> 01:44:38.725]  And that's what, at this juncture, is so incredibly dangerous.
[01:44:39.646 --> 01:44:41.487]  That is what government is always about.
[01:44:41.487 --> 01:44:43.767]  It's simply about forcing people to do things.
[01:44:43.767 --> 01:44:46.448]  It's not about explaining stuff to people.
[01:44:46.448 --> 01:44:50.189]  As Washington said, it's not about eloquence.
[01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:52.470]  It's not about compassion.
[01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:53.770]  It's simply force.
[01:44:53.770 --> 01:44:54.811]  That's what government is.
[01:44:54.811 --> 01:44:59.312]  So now it's gotten to the point where it's not good enough for them to have 9 out of 10 people vaccinated.
[01:44:59.312 --> 01:45:04.774]  They're going to force you if you don't want to submit to that kind of medical tyranny.
[01:45:06.474 --> 01:45:07.794]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:45:07.794 --> 01:45:09.535]  You want to make another comment?
[01:45:09.535 --> 01:45:10.435]  No, no, that's fine.
[01:45:10.435 --> 01:45:20.117]  Well, yeah, just really as far as people who are informed and are learning and educating themselves, I guess it's just an on-call.
[01:45:20.117 --> 01:45:24.538]  You know, it's like you can't say, yeah, I heard about this and swear it's true.
[01:45:24.538 --> 01:45:28.219]  You have to hear about it and then educate yourself too.
[01:45:28.219 --> 01:45:28.559]  And so,
[01:45:29.301 --> 01:45:34.085]  You know, you guys do a great job there as far as like having the link there for us to read.
[01:45:34.085 --> 01:45:34.725]  But guess what?
[01:45:34.725 --> 01:45:35.766]  We have to read them.
[01:45:35.766 --> 01:45:40.569]  You know, we can't just say we heard it on the show because what good is that?
[01:45:40.569 --> 01:45:42.210]  You have to read it for yourself.
[01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:43.571]  Yeah, you have to know what you believe.
[01:45:43.571 --> 01:45:50.697]  And one of the things they found in California was when they required people who said, well, I'm not really comfortable with vaccines, when they required them to come in,
[01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:58.261]  And have quote-unquote counseling where somebody in authority would sit down and very sternly tell them you understand that we know what's best for you.
[01:45:58.261 --> 01:46:00.541]  We've looked at this and so forth and so on.
[01:46:00.541 --> 01:46:08.905]  They found that in most cases the people would submit to that kind of authoritarian pressure because they weren't sure of why they were uncomfortable with it.
[01:46:08.905 --> 01:46:14.087]  So yeah, fundamentally you have to understand what's going on and don't find yourself in the kind of
[01:46:14.927 --> 01:46:27.352]  Regret that so many people in the panic of the swine flu vaccinations in 1976, when they were lied to, when that was hyped by the CDC, by the government, there were a lot of people who wound up with regrets.
[01:46:27.352 --> 01:46:31.354]  And there's a lot of people who have regrets that they had vaccines as well.
[01:46:31.354 --> 01:46:31.834]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:46:31.834 --> 01:46:33.995]  Let's go to Nathan in Louisiana.
[01:46:33.995 --> 01:46:36.176]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:46:36.176 --> 01:46:38.477]  You have something else you want to say, Mike?
[01:46:38.477 --> 01:46:39.918]  Okay, let's go to Nathan in Louisiana.
[01:46:39.918 --> 01:46:40.278]  Nathan?
[01:46:41.502 --> 01:46:42.102]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:42.102 --> 01:46:59.894]  I wanted to know, Paul, if you heard about and read the articles about the 2012 and 2014 court rulings in Italy, where the judges and the courts found that the vaccines with aluminum and thimerosal both have caused autism.
[01:46:59.894 --> 01:47:04.017]  You know, it's basically been a media blackout in the United States.
[01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:09.200]  But, you know, it had these basically monumental rulings in Italy.
[01:47:11.454 --> 01:47:13.135]  Yeah, there's a ton of stuff.
[01:47:13.135 --> 01:47:16.817]  I mean, Ron Paul put out a good article today, which is on Infowars.
[01:47:16.817 --> 01:47:29.905]  He points to the 2007 HPV vaccine, which again, amidst this national debate about enforcing mandatory vaccines against people's will, at gunpoint, which is the logical conclusion of their argument,
[01:47:30.465 --> 01:47:39.647]  Look back to 2007 when Rick Perry signed this order to mandate the HPV vaccine when most young girls were not even at risk of HPV.
[01:47:39.647 --> 01:47:43.808]  It was a massive outcry and that was subsequently rescinded.
[01:47:43.808 --> 01:47:56.651]  So, this idea of making it mandatory in California, the history behind it is not good for the potential mandatory application of vaccines.
[01:47:56.651 --> 01:47:58.432]  Of course it wasn't just... Yeah, go ahead.
[01:47:59.461 --> 01:48:03.144]  It's not just in Italy, it's also in Japan.
[01:48:03.144 --> 01:48:05.346]  They quit using MMR vaccines.
[01:48:05.346 --> 01:48:06.427]  I don't know if they started back or not.
[01:48:06.427 --> 01:48:09.869]  This is an old article going back to about 2000.
[01:48:09.869 --> 01:48:17.435]  They said they stopped using the MMR vaccine in Japan because it was linked to outbreaks of non-viral meningitis and other damaging side effects.
[01:48:17.435 --> 01:48:25.101]  They found at the time that a quarter of the roughly 4,000 medical compensation claims relating to vaccine
[01:48:25.801 --> 01:48:31.082]  Over a 30-year period had been made to people who had gotten the MMR vaccine.
[01:48:31.082 --> 01:48:32.482]  They were concerned about it.
[01:48:32.482 --> 01:48:40.864]  The statistics that they had been given said that they were only going to have a problem in about 1 out of every 100,000 to 200,000.
[01:48:40.864 --> 01:48:44.525]  Yet, it was 2,000 times greater than that.
[01:48:44.525 --> 01:48:49.766]  It was about 1 in every 900 kids was experiencing problems from the MMR vaccine.
[01:48:50.146 --> 01:48:58.895]  One of the things that they did, which is one of the things that Dr. Andrew Wakefield suggested, was to separate these out, to do them one at a time instead of a collective vaccine.
[01:48:58.895 --> 01:49:04.962]  But then there's still the issues of what has been added as preservatives, what has been added as adjuvants.
[01:49:04.962 --> 01:49:10.448]  People are asking for clean vaccines just like they're asking for clean food.
[01:49:11.008 --> 01:49:15.052]  But of course, they talk down to us and say, you don't understand what a vaccine's for.
[01:49:15.052 --> 01:49:20.757]  I understand the difference between a fast food french fry and a potato.
[01:49:20.757 --> 01:49:22.318]  And that's what this essentially boils down to.
[01:49:22.318 --> 01:49:25.121]  They're trying to tell us that we don't understand the science of vaccines.
[01:49:25.121 --> 01:49:28.404]  We perfectly do understand the science of vaccines.
[01:49:28.404 --> 01:49:32.407]  We're asking if they're going to have vaccines for them to be clean.
[01:49:32.407 --> 01:49:36.671]  But we're demanding, demanding that we have informed consent.
[01:49:36.671 --> 01:49:37.812]  Did you want to say anything else, Nathan?
[01:49:38.959 --> 01:49:45.361]  Yes sir, InfoWars is laying out a battle plan for people and showing people how to become citizen journalists.
[01:49:45.361 --> 01:49:56.886]  Last year, I found my own website, TheDailyResistance.com, and then I actually hooked up with another citizen journalist in New Orleans, David Abney from the NOLA Report, who y'all actually ran his story.
[01:49:56.886 --> 01:50:04.669]  He was the guy that interviewed John McCain about Benghazi at the Bill Cassidy rally, and y'all ran his story on National News.
[01:50:05.089 --> 01:50:16.140]  Well, in him now, because of InfoWars and because of Citizen Journalism, we now host a radio show on 8 o'clock on WGSO, 990 AM in New Orleans.
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:17.501]  It's called Battle of New Orleans.
[01:50:17.501 --> 01:50:19.363]  So, check it out.
[01:50:19.363 --> 01:50:24.187]  So, everybody, InfoWars is laying out a plan how to become Citizen Journalist.
[01:50:24.187 --> 01:50:26.710]  People want to understand and know what to do?
[01:50:26.710 --> 01:50:30.233]  Then put a notepad in your pocket and listen to the show and take notes.
[01:50:30.513 --> 01:50:30.753]  Absolutely.
[01:50:30.753 --> 01:50:31.394]  Battle for New Orleans.
[01:50:31.394 --> 01:50:31.734]  That's great.
[01:50:31.734 --> 01:50:33.575]  Yeah, you have to understand why you believe what you believe.
[01:50:33.575 --> 01:50:34.116]  Don't be intimidated.
[01:50:34.116 --> 01:50:35.857]  Don't be ignorant about what they're trying to do with you.
[01:50:35.857 --> 01:50:36.317]  Stay with us.
[01:50:36.317 --> 01:50:38.479]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Wesson and your calls.

[01:52:58.311 --> 01:53:02.792]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[01:53:02.792 --> 01:53:07.634]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[01:53:07.634 --> 01:53:15.116]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.

[01:53:29.979 --> 01:53:33.900]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:37.341]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:53:38.021 --> 01:53:39.021]  It's been the past week or so.
[01:53:39.021 --> 01:53:41.602]  I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain is gone.
[01:53:41.602 --> 01:53:45.963]  I'm just finishing up a five-pound tuff I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.

[01:54:14.838 --> 01:54:16.279]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:16.279 --> 01:54:23.564]  I'm David Knight, your host today, and I have Paul Joseph Watson with us on the line from the UK, and we're taking your calls, questions for Paul.
[01:54:23.564 --> 01:54:31.429]  Of course, in the next hour, we're going to be talking to Dr. John Dunn, a physician of 44 years, an attorney for 36 years.
[01:54:31.429 --> 01:54:40.015]  He's going to be joining us to talk about the medical and ethical questions behind the continued human testing being conducted by the EPA.
[01:54:40.015 --> 01:54:41.416]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:41.416 --> 01:54:43.497]  Let's go to Chad in Washington.
[01:54:43.497 --> 01:54:44.518]  Chad, you had a question for Paul.
[01:54:46.798 --> 01:54:52.643]  Yeah, I just quickly want to touch on two things.
[01:54:52.643 --> 01:55:12.718]  As far as that one guy talking about research and stuff, I think if people wanted to research a topic, an important one would be geoengineering, just so that when the media tries to come out with, you know, the climate change and the carbon taxes, they'll at least be aware of what's being sprayed in the sky.
[01:55:13.499 --> 01:55:21.712]  But then the other thing I just wanted to know what happened with that post that Joe Biggs put out last night of the big bomb going off in Ukraine.
[01:55:21.712 --> 01:55:26.380]  I wondered if anybody knew any more about that.
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:26.580]  Good.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:28.043]  Paul, you want to touch that?
[01:55:29.278 --> 01:55:35.220]  Yeah, from what I read from the reports in the morning, it was a chemical factory that got bombed.
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:42.842]  So it was the Kiev government bombing the pro-Russian rebels and it was actually a chemical factory that got bombed.
[01:55:42.842 --> 01:55:44.803]  So on the other subject,
[01:55:45.501 --> 01:55:46.782]  Geoengineering.
[01:55:46.782 --> 01:55:50.085]  Obviously, we've had this huge global warming scandal that came out yesterday.
[01:55:50.085 --> 01:55:54.850]  They got caught adding one degree to all the ground surface temperature data.
[01:55:54.850 --> 01:55:56.852]  Again, huge scandal.
[01:55:56.852 --> 01:56:00.835]  But their solutions to solve global warming, a problem that doesn't exist.
[01:56:00.835 --> 01:56:02.717]  There's been no global warming for the past 18 years.
[01:56:03.738 --> 01:56:14.247]  And actually, they amended the 1930s data to make the 1930s look cooler, so the subsequent temperature increases looked more dramatic.
[01:56:14.247 --> 01:56:22.033]  But their solutions are things like, you know, spraying the atmosphere with sulfur, which is linked with acid rain, immune deficiency, and a bunch of other horrors.
[01:56:22.033 --> 01:56:31.181]  So the proposals to solve a problem that doesn't exist, global warming, are worse than any speculation about climate change itself.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:47.249]  And of course, it's all just a beard for global control of, basically fund a global government through global taxes, as well as to redistribute your income to people like Al Gore and his partner, Mr. Blood.
[01:56:47.249 --> 01:56:48.790]  Blood and Gore.
[01:56:48.790 --> 01:56:50.991]  Let's go to Gerald in California.
[01:56:50.991 --> 01:56:51.552]  Gerald, go ahead.
[01:56:53.297 --> 01:56:57.060]  Hey guys, hey Mr. Watson, hey Mr. Knight, I appreciate everything you guys do.
[01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:07.429]  I want to touch on three things, and pardon me if I'm going backwards, but the State of the Union speech by, you know, who we all know as The Crook.
[01:57:07.429 --> 01:57:22.121]  Do you guys think the emphasis on the possible power grid failure is a way to pretty much stage an EMP attack on this country as well as, you know, the staged economic crisis that we're looking at?
[01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:24.710]  Paul, do you want to comment?
[01:57:24.710 --> 01:57:26.512]  Or do you want me to?
[01:57:26.512 --> 01:57:29.256]  I'm not sure if it's directly linked.
[01:57:29.256 --> 01:57:35.964]  I know the fact is that many wealthy elitists now in more and more numbers are escaping the United States.
[01:57:35.964 --> 01:57:41.751]  We had the economist at the Davos Economic Forum just over a week ago come out and say that
[01:57:42.171 --> 01:57:45.453]  People are buying property in New Zealand in remote locations.
[01:57:45.453 --> 01:57:55.739]  The realtors that they spoke to in New Zealand said that the elitists are citing, you know, concerns about their own personal safety as a result for leaving the United States.
[01:57:55.739 --> 01:58:07.006]  And it's something that you hear over and over again, that the wealthier, they're preparing an escape plan to leave the United States, which could be for a number of reasons, mainly economic.
[01:58:07.006 --> 01:58:10.709]  I'm not sure about the EMP angle, but definitely they've got that escape plan.
[01:58:11.269 --> 01:58:17.750]  Well, certainly, they're looking for ways to take over the Internet, and that would be one of the justifications to protect the power grid.
[01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:22.271]  That is what they're going to move on, regardless of what he said about education or taxes.
[01:58:22.271 --> 01:58:28.333]  It's really about NAFTA, not NAFTA, but the Transatlantic Trans-Pacific Partnerships, and taking over control of the Internet.
[01:58:28.333 --> 01:58:29.793]  That's where they're going to be moving.
[01:58:29.793 --> 01:58:30.533]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:58:30.533 --> 01:58:32.233]  Paul Joseph Watson, stay with us.
[01:58:32.233 --> 01:58:39.075]  In the next hour, we're going to be talking to Dr. John Dunn about medical ethics and human experimentation.
[01:58:39.075 --> 01:58:39.495]  Stay with us.

[02:00:17.427 --> 02:00:21.489]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.834 --> 02:00:27.194]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:27.194 --> 02:00:28.415]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:00:28.415 --> 02:00:30.936]  I'm going to be joined in the next segment, Dr. John Dunn.
[02:00:30.936 --> 02:00:33.856]  As we pointed out, he's a physician and lawyer.
[02:00:33.856 --> 02:00:41.579]  He's going to be talking to us about the medical and ethical issues behind the EPA's continued human experimentation.
[02:00:41.579 --> 02:00:46.560]  But in this segment, I want to try to cover some of the people who've been holding to talk to Paul.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:49.861]  Paul's no longer with us, but I'll still take your calls and comments.
[02:00:49.861 --> 02:00:52.142]  Let's go to Jimmy in New Jersey.
[02:00:52.142 --> 02:00:52.342]  Jimmy?
[02:00:53.991 --> 02:00:55.251]  Hey, how are you doing, David?
[02:00:55.251 --> 02:00:56.272]  Doing good.
[02:00:56.272 --> 02:00:57.232]  What's your comment?
[02:00:57.232 --> 02:01:04.534]  Um, I actually just, I wanted to ask a question, um, about remote neural monitoring, I guess.
[02:01:04.534 --> 02:01:06.255]  I've been reading about it.
[02:01:06.255 --> 02:01:12.297]  Um, and literally my cousin who is, uh, in the, uh, the army, he's in Germany.
[02:01:12.297 --> 02:01:18.779]  He's recently called me and he's been saying things like, if I hadn't been listening to this show, I would literally think he's crazy.
[02:01:19.799 --> 02:01:38.407]  Um, but he's telling me that he's hearing nothing but voices, he can't go to sleep, um, something happened to him at some point, and it's kind of like a cell phone, like a back and forth thing he's saying, that he hears things talking to him, um, and, and kind of answering.
[02:01:38.407 --> 02:01:46.750]  Now, again, I know it sounds, it sounds nuts, but then I started reading more about it, and I'm like, how can I even help him?
[02:01:48.690 --> 02:01:50.993]  I don't have an answer for you as to how you can help him.
[02:01:50.993 --> 02:01:58.403]  In terms of what they're capable of doing, we know that there's a lot of stuff that they're capable of doing that they haven't made public.
[02:01:58.403 --> 02:02:04.251]  We do know that they have made public a lot of brain research that they're working on, the Brain Project.
[02:02:04.251 --> 02:02:06.213]  We know that they have done a lot of research.
[02:02:07.034 --> 02:02:13.501]  In the name of helping disabled veterans being able to remotely control brains by using an implant.
[02:02:13.501 --> 02:02:22.652]  But what you're talking about is kind of an RF feed and of course this is the classic tinfoil hat wearing that the people mock about.
[02:02:23.499 --> 02:02:29.162]  Yet we had the guy who shot up the Navy Yard right on the butt of his gun.
[02:02:29.162 --> 02:02:31.823]  This is my ELF weapon.
[02:02:31.823 --> 02:02:33.884]  Extremely low frequency.
[02:02:33.884 --> 02:02:48.552]  We know that, I guess it was about 30 years ago in the information war, that Michael Aquino, the Satanist who works for the NSA, was talking about how it would be very useful to control populations with extremely low frequency.
[02:02:49.632 --> 02:03:01.238]  I personally don't know any details about that but I know that a lot of people we've interviewed people who have physicians who have talked to people that said that they believed that they were being
[02:03:02.432 --> 02:03:22.820]  Monitor that they were having information Transmitted in the brains and of course the brain is electrical So there's a lot that can be done in that area and then as to whether that's what's happening with your friend I don't know, but there are very If I can remember now this article that we when we when this came out with the shooting we talked to a guy who was a physician and
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:40.033]  And he made some very clear distinctions between people who are just suffering from real schizophrenia versus people who had a late life, sudden onset of hearing these voices, that he believed there was very clear case that this was something that was being done electronically to those people.
[02:03:40.033 --> 02:03:42.515]  So I can't really give you any more of an answer than that, Jimmy.
[02:03:42.515 --> 02:03:44.877]  Sorry.
[02:03:44.877 --> 02:03:47.579]  Let's go to A.D.
[02:03:47.579 --> 02:03:48.200]  in Delaware.
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:48.580]  Go ahead.
[02:03:50.222 --> 02:03:51.303]  Yeah, how you guys doing?
[02:03:51.303 --> 02:03:52.804]  I know that's a dumb question.
[02:03:52.804 --> 02:04:00.110]  Look, Richard Allen Miller just talks about these chemtrails turning human beings into antennas.
[02:04:00.110 --> 02:04:00.591]  I believe it.
[02:04:00.591 --> 02:04:07.897]  When I went to stopthecrime.net, they're talking about the triangulation between smartphones, smart meters, and the entire spy grid.
[02:04:08.717 --> 02:04:28.002]  Uh, I believe with these vaccines and some of these other issues, they're trying to get these metals and chemicals into the children, into people quicker, uh, using these, uh, ridiculous measles outbreaks as a way to, like they did the H1N1 and the swine flu, but that's absolutely what is happening.
[02:04:28.002 --> 02:04:31.403]  They're worrying, they're working on, just like the, uh, Aurora shooter,
[02:04:32.083 --> 02:04:34.504]  Who is involved in this program.
[02:04:34.504 --> 02:04:37.785]  They want to have mind control through electronics.
[02:04:37.785 --> 02:04:41.746]  And I believe that they are turning us into human antennas.
[02:04:41.746 --> 02:04:48.467]  I believe that the military is the biggest guinea pig laboratory on the planet.
[02:04:48.467 --> 02:04:49.888]  And you know what else happens Dave?
[02:04:51.448 --> 02:04:52.269]  We're about out of time.
[02:04:52.269 --> 02:04:54.311]  We're going to be right back with Dr. John Dunn.
[02:04:54.311 --> 02:04:58.776]  And regardless, I have a lot of concerns about the additives going into our food and our vaccines.
[02:04:58.776 --> 02:05:03.141]  We know the government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.141 --> 02:05:07.086]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:07.406 --> 02:05:09.188]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:09.188 --> 02:05:17.057]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:17.057 --> 02:05:18.198]  But for how long?
[02:05:18.198 --> 02:05:21.261]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:05:21.261 --> 02:05:24.886]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:05:28.993 --> 02:05:32.494]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:32.494 --> 02:05:40.737]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:40.737 --> 02:05:46.158]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:05:46.158 --> 02:05:48.699]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:05:48.699 --> 02:05:50.800]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:06:58.939 --> 02:07:02.324]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:07:02.324 --> 02:07:05.828]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:07:05.828 --> 02:07:11.916]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:07:11.916 --> 02:07:13.318]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:07:13.318 --> 02:07:13.799]  I'm all about...
[02:07:13.939 --> 02:07:15.440]  The individual being empowered.
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.081]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:07:17.081 --> 02:07:21.883]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:07:21.883 --> 02:07:26.465]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[02:07:26.465 --> 02:07:29.126]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[02:08:31.593 --> 02:08:32.914]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:32.914 --> 02:08:34.195]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:08:34.195 --> 02:08:37.118]  Joining us now is Dr. John Dunn.
[02:08:37.118 --> 02:08:40.000]  Dr. Dunn is a physician for 44 years.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.862]  He's been a practicing attorney for 36 years.
[02:08:42.862 --> 02:08:50.228]  His particular interest is in the philosophy of science and ethics, and of course he looks at scientific misconduct.
[02:08:50.228 --> 02:08:52.530]  A good place to look is the EPA.
[02:08:53.430 --> 02:09:02.337]  When I first began here at InfoWars, as a story was breaking, this was something that was originally turned up by JunkScience.com.
[02:09:02.337 --> 02:09:05.660]  Steve Malloy at JunkScience.com had filed some FOIA requests.
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:13.547]  He saw some interesting reports that looked kind of strange to him, and he probed a little bit further with some FOIA requests, and he found out
[02:09:14.187 --> 02:09:22.256]  That the EPA in North Carolina was actually conducting human experiments and doing it without informed consent.
[02:09:22.256 --> 02:09:24.398]  Doing things that were very dangerous.
[02:09:25.419 --> 02:09:29.801]  According, especially according to what the EPA had testified before Congress.
[02:09:29.801 --> 02:09:39.385]  We've got a clip of EPA's director at the time, Lisa Jackson, talking to Congressman Markey at the time, and listen to this dialogue back and forth.
[02:09:39.385 --> 02:09:48.549]  They've already worked out what they're going to say, and so Congressman Markey is feeding her information about how this is more dangerous than cancer.
[02:09:48.549 --> 02:09:51.550]  What they're talking about is fine particulate matter.
[02:09:53.432 --> 02:09:56.555]  2.5 millimeters, or maybe it's nanometers.
[02:09:56.555 --> 02:10:03.363]  Anyway, it's small, particular matter, and of course Dr. Dunn can clarify that for us, but listen to what they said in the congressional testimony.
[02:10:04.048 --> 02:10:09.651]  Cumulatively, what are the benefits of cleaning up particulate matter?
[02:10:09.651 --> 02:10:13.493]  Does that help or hurt our efforts to battle cancer?
[02:10:13.493 --> 02:10:18.236]  To battle the impact that it has upon the health of people in our country?
[02:10:18.236 --> 02:10:20.817]  Particulate matter causes premature deaths.
[02:10:20.817 --> 02:10:21.898]  It doesn't make you sick.
[02:10:21.898 --> 02:10:25.380]  It's directly causal to dying sooner than you should.
[02:10:25.380 --> 02:10:26.881]  It doesn't make you sick, it kills you.
[02:10:27.581 --> 02:10:33.631]  Efforts, cost-effective efforts, I might add, to address particulate matter are more people dying sooner than they should.
[02:10:33.631 --> 02:10:35.514]  How would you compare it to the fight against cancer?
[02:10:36.172 --> 02:10:37.432]  Reducing particulate matter?
[02:10:37.432 --> 02:10:38.893]  Yeah, I was briefed not long ago.
[02:10:38.893 --> 02:10:46.816]  If we could reduce particulate matter to healthy levels, it would have the same impact as finding a cure for cancer in our country.
[02:10:46.816 --> 02:10:48.676]  Can you say that sentence one more time?
[02:10:48.676 --> 02:10:49.477]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:49.477 --> 02:10:58.020]  If we could reduce particulate matter to levels that are healthy, we would have an identical impact to finding a cure for cancer.
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:10:59.680]  That's a pretty good cumulative impact.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:03.982]  Yeah, it's also questionable whether or not that's true, but if it is true,
[02:11:04.878 --> 02:11:26.214]  What they did in these human experiments, if this is something that kills more people than cancer, if this is something that doesn't just make you sick, but kills you, what they did in their experiments at the University of North Carolina, and then what they subsequently did to children in California, and now what they're starting to do to asthmatic African American teenagers, they're continuing the experiments in North Carolina,
[02:11:26.994 --> 02:11:32.736]  If, in fact, it does kill you, not just make you sick, then what they're doing is criminal.
[02:11:32.736 --> 02:11:38.459]  Because they're exposing people to over 70 times the limit that they have said would kill you.
[02:11:38.459 --> 02:11:41.800]  Let's go to Dr. Dunn and have him break this down for us.
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:43.441]  Welcome, Dr. Dunn.
[02:11:43.441 --> 02:11:45.062]  Thank you for having me.
[02:11:45.062 --> 02:11:48.103]  I want to make one correction.
[02:11:48.103 --> 02:11:50.044]  I don't practice law.
[02:11:50.044 --> 02:11:55.426]  I'm a non-practicing attorney and I may have put that down wrong in the biography that I sent to you.
[02:11:55.748 --> 02:11:57.130]  You got it, and I read it wrong.
[02:11:57.130 --> 02:11:57.651]  Sorry.
[02:11:57.651 --> 02:11:58.032]  Yes.
[02:11:58.032 --> 02:12:04.602]  I graduated from law school in 1979, but I never have practiced law.
[02:12:04.602 --> 02:12:10.792]  I just took the bar exams in the places where I lived, just so that I could say that I was a member of the bar.
[02:12:11.644 --> 02:12:15.985]  And never had any intention of having clients in the practice of law.
[02:12:15.985 --> 02:12:17.085]  I understand.
[02:12:17.085 --> 02:12:22.606]  Nevertheless, with your interest in law and as a physician, you're interested in medical ethics.
[02:12:22.606 --> 02:12:27.587]  Tell us about this experiment with the EPA and what you have concerns about.
[02:12:27.587 --> 02:12:40.230]  We discovered that the EPA admits under oath in a lawsuit that we filed to try to stop the human experiments at the University of North Carolina.
[02:12:41.038 --> 02:12:55.667]  That there are 10 medical schools in the United States that have been doing human exposure experiments with air pollutants in laboratories to see if they could cause any harm to the subjects.
[02:12:55.667 --> 02:13:04.912]  Then they would report it as proof that these air pollutants are toxic.
[02:13:04.912 --> 02:13:06.914]  This whole calloury between
[02:13:08.058 --> 02:13:08.318]  Ms.
[02:13:08.318 --> 02:13:12.079]  Jackson and Congressman Markey.
[02:13:12.079 --> 02:13:19.520]  It is a setup and it follows what has been the theme of the EPA for about 20 years.
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:26.182]  Small particles in the air are toxic, lethal and cause cancer.
[02:13:26.182 --> 02:13:28.982]  And there is no safe level.
[02:13:28.982 --> 02:13:37.024]  So if you apply an ethical standard to it, you have to consider it to be a situation where human
[02:13:38.544 --> 02:13:58.895]  Experiments would not be allowed under any even tortured interpretation of the law in the United States and international law as well as all the recommendations of international groups in regards to human experimentation.
[02:13:58.895 --> 02:14:06.799]  The problem of human experimentation was made acutely a consideration
[02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:25.124]  As in the post-World War II era, and the Nuremberg trials included trials of about 20 physicians who were involved in the most notorious of the human experiments that the Nazis did.
[02:14:25.124 --> 02:14:35.326]  It wasn't the whole list of doctors who may have been involved in human experiments that were unethical and immoral and illegal and criminal, but these were the guys who
[02:14:36.005 --> 02:14:39.947]  Organized and led these experimental groups.
[02:14:39.947 --> 02:14:46.511]  And they did things like take people's arms off to see if they could transplant them to somebody else.
[02:14:46.511 --> 02:14:50.894]  And of course, naturally the patient died.
[02:14:50.894 --> 02:15:01.240]  They did what was considered to be extremely harmful and horrific experiments on freezing.
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:02.101]  What they did was they
[02:15:02.628 --> 02:15:09.449]  They put people in freezing water to see if they could be revived from the point where they were dead.
[02:15:09.449 --> 02:15:16.551]  There were all kinds of human experiments that were done by Nazi physicians and it resulted in the Nuremberg Code.
[02:15:16.551 --> 02:15:30.014]  The Nuremberg Code is a list of rules for physicians and researchers in regards to doing a human experiment and it prohibits any human experiment that might be harmful to the subject.
[02:15:30.014 --> 02:15:31.274]  You cannot consent
[02:15:32.423 --> 02:15:34.550]  to a human experiment
[02:15:40.919 --> 02:15:41.339]  That's right.
[02:15:41.339 --> 02:15:50.868]  And, of course, today we're hearing many on the left, even Fox News, saying, well, you know, if you don't want to get your MMR vaccine, I don't need to get your informed consent.
[02:15:50.868 --> 02:15:52.529]  I can just make you take it.
[02:15:52.529 --> 02:15:53.690]  But we've seen this history.
[02:15:53.690 --> 02:15:55.271]  It's not just Nazi Germany.
[02:15:55.271 --> 02:16:04.840]  This happened in the United States, of course, with the infamous Tuskegee experiments, where they did not inform these people that they were giving them syphilis.
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:08.583]  Well, you know, race was the reason why the Tuskegee experiments were
[02:16:09.116 --> 02:16:12.939]  We're considered to be extraordinarily offensive.
[02:16:12.939 --> 02:16:27.510]  But understand this, there were experiments conducted by the CIA in regards to mind-bending drugs like LSD.
[02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:37.298]  And they were done, in some cases, on staff of the CIA without their knowledge, just to see what would happen if you gave them
[02:16:38.220 --> 02:16:41.603]  Yes, that book was, I think, a terrible mistake.
[02:16:41.603 --> 02:16:43.224]  What was the guy's name?
[02:16:43.224 --> 02:16:44.145]  You know his name?
[02:16:44.145 --> 02:16:48.168]  You are a real researcher.
[02:16:48.168 --> 02:16:50.410]  In any event, there are human experiments
[02:17:07.409 --> 02:17:23.258]  With regards to yellow fever, with regards to tuberculosis, with regards to leprosy, that no longer are considered to be acceptable in ethical terms, moral terms, or legal terms.
[02:17:23.258 --> 02:17:32.403]  There are criminal offenses involved in exposing someone to a harmful substance intentionally.
[02:17:32.403 --> 02:17:33.283]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:17:35.066 --> 02:17:40.778]  Uh, by a criminal intent or in this case, uh, research that might be, uh, done on human,
[02:17:43.434 --> 02:17:45.235]  Hang on, we've got to go to a commercial break.
[02:17:45.235 --> 02:17:46.955]  Just let people know before we go to a commercial break.
[02:17:46.955 --> 02:17:48.216]  That is a terrible mistake.
[02:17:48.216 --> 02:17:53.658]  It was a story of Frank Olson who was working with the biological chemical experiments.
[02:17:53.658 --> 02:18:04.382]  They had brought over many war criminals from Nazi Germany, from Japan to head up that biological chemical research and as part of Operation Paperclip.
[02:18:04.382 --> 02:18:07.983]  But of course, there's numerous examples as Dr. Dunn has pointed out.
[02:18:07.983 --> 02:18:11.745]  When we come back, we're going to talk about the
[02:18:12.385 --> 02:18:40.463]  The EPA has kind of painted themselves into a corner where they either have to admit that they were lying to us about the danger of fine particulate matter 2.5 or they were lying to the patients and violated the Nuremberg rules as well as national criminal prohibitions against that.
[02:18:40.463 --> 02:18:40.643]  Dr. Dunn,
[02:18:42.124 --> 02:18:49.408]  Give us a quick take on where we're going to go with this after the break when we look at the rules that they violated.
[02:18:49.408 --> 02:19:03.096]  Well, I'd like to make sure that the people who are listening understand that small particulate matter is probably not lethal, as the EPA claims it is, and that there was always a wink and a nod about this.
[02:19:03.096 --> 02:19:10.980]  They were saying on the one hand to the public and to the Congress, oh my goodness, we need to control small particulate air pollution because it's going to kill
[02:19:11.531 --> 02:19:16.421]  As many people as cancer does, when in fact they knew that was a lie.
[02:19:16.421 --> 02:19:23.716]  And I would like to talk to people about the research that was funded by the EPA that produced that lie.
[02:19:25.023 --> 02:19:25.564]  Absolutely.
[02:19:25.564 --> 02:19:31.808]  But the issue is, and I agree with you, I don't think it is nearly as dangerous as the EPA says that it is.
[02:19:31.808 --> 02:19:36.052]  They exposed people to levels that were 70 times higher than they said would kill people.
[02:19:36.052 --> 02:19:37.233]  It didn't kill people.
[02:19:37.233 --> 02:19:47.000]  Nevertheless, what is really important is that they could establish a precedent that they don't need to get people's informed consent for something that they say could kill you.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.524]  If they can do it for something that isn't a real threat, they can do it for something that really is a threat to your health.
[02:19:51.845 --> 02:19:52.186]  Stay with us.
[02:19:52.186 --> 02:19:58.407]  We're going to be right back with Dr. John Dunn talking about medical ethics and informed consent.
[02:19:59.395 --> 02:20:00.816]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[02:20:00.816 --> 02:20:02.958]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[02:20:02.958 --> 02:20:06.281]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com.

[02:24:07.621 --> 02:24:08.506]  Yeah.
[02:24:16.168 --> 02:24:19.091]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:19.091 --> 02:24:21.794]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Dr. John Dunn.
[02:24:21.794 --> 02:24:25.758]  He's been a practicing physician for 44 years.
[02:24:25.758 --> 02:24:32.264]  He is also a policy and science advisor for Heartland Institute of Chicago and the American Council on Science and Health.
[02:24:32.264 --> 02:24:38.270]  He's current editor for JunkScience.com and that's the capacity in which we're calling him right now because it was Junk Science
[02:24:38.891 --> 02:24:39.412]  Thank you.
[02:24:54.042 --> 02:24:57.644]  Particulate matter was not something that would just make you sick, it would kill you.
[02:24:57.644 --> 02:25:23.462]  Nevertheless, even though we don't believe that that was true, we believe the EPA was overstating the danger of particulate, fine particulate matter, nevertheless, using their own information, they proceeded to do human experimentation on people without their informed consent, not telling them what the dangers are, not telling them that you're going to be exposed to 70 times the fine particulate matter that we say will kill you.
[02:25:24.222 --> 02:25:25.643]  That's the issue right here.
[02:25:25.643 --> 02:25:39.447]  So whether or not it was something that would actually was a danger to them, nevertheless we have established a precedent where the government can come in and subject you to something that the government believes and says is going to kill you.
[02:25:39.447 --> 02:25:42.828]  That's the really dangerous thing here in my opinion.
[02:25:42.828 --> 02:25:46.790]  The lack of informed consent and as Dr. Dunn was pointing out, you cannot
[02:25:47.350 --> 02:25:55.495]  legally give informed consent for something that is that dangerous, something that is going to permanently harm or kill you.
[02:25:55.495 --> 02:25:59.418]  You cannot legally give informed consent for yourself or for your children.
[02:25:59.418 --> 02:26:05.962]  Dr. Dunn, you were getting ready to talk as we ran out of time about the actual issues of fine particulate matter.
[02:26:05.962 --> 02:26:07.403]  Go ahead.
[02:26:07.403 --> 02:26:16.749]  Well, you have to understand that the reason this is important is that for 20 years the EPA has been increasingly aggressive
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:31.251]  In regulating emissions from smokestacks and emissions from vehicles, and it was always on the basis of the fact that they were going to save all these lives.
[02:26:31.251 --> 02:26:44.621]  That emissions of various kinds had small particulates in them, and that those small particulates, according to the EPA, were proven by research to be killing people.
[02:26:45.208 --> 02:26:52.350]  Well, the research that they did is called epidemiology, which is a population study.
[02:26:52.350 --> 02:27:04.493]  And it's so uncontrolled that small signs of some effect have to be measured against the nature of the research itself and the methodology.
[02:27:04.493 --> 02:27:07.974]  And there's no way that the epidemiology that the EPA uses
[02:27:08.789 --> 02:27:12.151]  Can prove anything, and they admitted it under oath.
[02:27:12.151 --> 02:27:31.860]  We sued them about the human experiments at the University of North Carolina, and as a part of the initial discovery in federal court, the parties are asked to give declarations under oath, a written statement of their case or their defense of the case.
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:38.063]  In this case, there were five EPA officials who provided declarations
[02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:43.271]  Under oath, in writing, that admitted to a couple of things.
[02:27:43.271 --> 02:28:04.555]  First, the physician, Dr. Wayne Cascio, who was in charge of the human experiments at the University of North Carolina, admitted that ten medical schools in the United States and six medical schools in foreign countries were doing human exposure experiments with air pollution.
[02:28:04.555 --> 02:28:06.916]  The second admission that I thought was important
[02:28:07.566 --> 02:28:22.978]  Was Dr. Martin Case, who was the administrator of the University of North Carolina program, and he said that they did not tell people that they could die from their exposure to small particle air pollution in the experiment.
[02:28:22.978 --> 02:28:36.868]  So when they got a consent to do the experiment, the individuals who agreed to the experiment, who were paid some money to do it, they were like college students and people that were
[02:28:37.646 --> 02:28:45.168]  Living in the Chapel Hill area who wanted to make a little money from being a subject of an experiment.
[02:28:45.168 --> 02:28:49.649]  They were not told that they could die from this or that they could get cancer.
[02:28:49.649 --> 02:28:56.230]  And of course they were selecting out people who had respiratory illness, who had heart issues as well.
[02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:58.210]  Well some of them were and some of them weren't.
[02:28:58.210 --> 02:29:00.031]  And the experiments were more than one.
[02:29:00.031 --> 02:29:05.932]  So you could say that the subjects of the experiments varied from the experimental method
[02:29:06.721 --> 02:29:06.921]  I don't
[02:29:26.636 --> 02:29:27.477]  Hang on, Dr. Dunn.
[02:29:27.477 --> 02:29:29.538]  We've got to take another commercial break and we're going to be right back.
[02:29:29.538 --> 02:29:30.880]  We've got a long segment.
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:36.584]  We'll also take your calls if you have any questions about this particular experiment.
[02:29:36.584 --> 02:29:44.831]  It's amazing to me that they're essentially hooking people up to the tailpipe of a diesel engine and observing them.
[02:29:44.831 --> 02:29:47.734]  This is what the EPA is doing to people in North Carolina.
[02:29:47.734 --> 02:29:49.695]  We'll be back with Dr. John Dunn.
[02:29:49.695 --> 02:29:50.055]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.055 --> 02:29:52.538]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:30:59.292 --> 02:31:02.674]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:31:02.674 --> 02:31:06.176]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:31:06.176 --> 02:31:12.260]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:31:12.260 --> 02:31:13.381]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:31:13.641 --> 02:31:15.781]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:31:15.781 --> 02:31:17.422]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:31:17.422 --> 02:31:22.223]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:31:22.223 --> 02:31:26.804]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[02:31:59.222 --> 02:32:08.151]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[02:32:08.151 --> 02:32:14.737]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:32:15.237 --> 02:32:18.719]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[02:32:18.719 --> 02:32:20.360]  population could perish.
[02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:23.842]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[02:32:23.842 --> 02:32:26.084]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[02:32:26.084 --> 02:32:27.725]  Mass riots will follow.
[02:32:27.725 --> 02:32:29.906]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[02:32:29.906 --> 02:32:33.988]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?

[02:33:00.174 --> 02:33:06.697]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:33:06.697 --> 02:33:11.079]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:11.079 --> 02:33:16.702]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:24.153]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.153 --> 02:33:25.275]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:33:25.275 --> 02:33:32.348]  We've been talking to Dr. John Donne, a physician who is concerned about medical ethics.
[02:33:32.348 --> 02:33:35.153]  It's a shame we don't have more physicians who are concerned about that.
[02:33:35.976 --> 02:33:48.304]  We're talking about informed consent and we're talking about, as Dr. Dunn pointed out, this is something that's been going on for quite some time by the EPA in violating people's informed consent.
[02:33:48.304 --> 02:33:52.386]  Of course, you can never have informed consent if it is something that is life-threatening.
[02:33:52.386 --> 02:33:55.188]  That's part of the Nuremberg Prohibitions.
[02:33:55.188 --> 02:33:57.630]  The difficult spot that the EPA is in...
[02:33:58.570 --> 02:34:08.894]  Is they either have to admit that their regulations are far overstated or else they are literally exposing people to things that could kill them.
[02:34:08.894 --> 02:34:11.555]  There's no way that they can justify that.
[02:34:11.555 --> 02:34:14.516]  We're going to go back to Dr. Dunn in just a moment.
[02:34:14.516 --> 02:34:17.917]  We'll also take your calls if you have calls or questions or comments for Dr. Dunn.
[02:34:18.537 --> 02:34:21.440]  That number is 800-259-9231.
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:25.924]  We've got a couple of callers who are still holding over from when we had Paul Watson on.
[02:34:25.924 --> 02:34:28.506]  I apologize that we weren't able to get to you.
[02:34:28.506 --> 02:34:33.611]  If you want to hold on to the overdrive, I'll take your calls and questions then.
[02:34:33.611 --> 02:34:42.439]  But I want to take people who have calls at this point in time for Dr. Dunn regarding what we've been talking about, about EPA human experimentation.
[02:34:43.019 --> 02:34:48.181]  Before we go back to Dr. Don, I want to let you know that we have a February special here at Infowarslife.com.
[02:34:48.181 --> 02:34:52.743]  You can save 20% off of super male and super female vitality.
[02:34:52.743 --> 02:34:57.325]  This is a unique formula, completely free of GMOs, harmful additives, gluten.
[02:34:57.325 --> 02:35:05.288]  It's made in the USA and specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.
[02:35:05.948 --> 02:35:08.890]  Again, that's 20% off for the month of February.
[02:35:08.890 --> 02:35:11.212]  Super male, super female vitality.
[02:35:11.212 --> 02:35:15.274]  You can get that at Infowarslife.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[02:35:15.274 --> 02:35:18.717]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:35:18.717 --> 02:35:25.721]  Dr. Dunn, you were just talking about how this is something that's been going on for quite some time.
[02:35:25.721 --> 02:35:30.905]  Before I get your comments, I just want to lay this out again for the audience, what they are doing in these experiments.
[02:35:31.485 --> 02:35:37.332]  This is EE News, Energy and Environment Policy News, reports about these experiments.
[02:35:37.332 --> 02:35:43.639]  They say that the EPA is recruiting asthmatic African American teenagers now from Raleigh, North Carolina.
[02:35:43.639 --> 02:35:46.122]  They're going to get paid $594 for six weekly visits, about $100 a week.
[02:35:49.346 --> 02:35:52.267]  To answer questions about the exposures that they're going to get.
[02:35:52.267 --> 02:35:53.827]  Now, what are they going to do to these kids?
[02:35:53.827 --> 02:36:02.789]  Well, they're going to have the recruits brought into study chambers at the EPA's Human Studies Facility at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
[02:36:02.789 --> 02:36:10.390]  They're going to be exposed to air pollutants like diesel exhaust, ozone, or concentrated air particles from car exhaust.
[02:36:10.390 --> 02:36:17.292]  That's right, they're going to hook these people, they're going to put them in a small enclosure, hook them up directly to tailpipes,
[02:36:17.932 --> 02:36:24.014]  You know, I sent a letter and called the people in charge of the Institutional Review Board at the University of North Carolina.
[02:36:49.406 --> 02:36:52.328]  I said, what are you doing?
[02:36:52.328 --> 02:37:16.160]  How could you possibly excuse the idea that, on the one hand, the EPA is telling the Congress and the public that these air pollutants are lethal, toxic, and cause cancer, and there is no safe level, and in a laboratory that is sponsored and approved by the EPA
[02:37:17.546 --> 02:37:33.053]  And the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, you're exposing people to these air pollutants in chambers at levels that are clearly higher than what the EPA says is the safe level in the United States.
[02:37:33.053 --> 02:37:37.855]  And I want to remind you that the EPA has an interesting approach to this.
[02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:55.416]  They really what they say is that there is no safe level and then every so often they just crank down the level that's acceptable so that they can put another compliance and regulatory rule in effect.
[02:37:55.416 --> 02:38:02.499]  Energy companies and coal-fired energy plants are being regulated
[02:38:03.112 --> 02:38:18.684]  And then what they do is, a year or two after the first regulation comes in, there's a second regulation that reduces the levels of emissions allowed even more, on the theory that there is no safe level for these air pollutants.
[02:38:18.684 --> 02:38:26.350]  They want to say that there's no safe level, they have a level that they say will kill you, not just make you sick, and yet they expose these people to 70 times that level.
[02:38:26.350 --> 02:38:28.572]  They can't have it both ways.
[02:38:28.572 --> 02:38:31.033]  Well, that's true, and the reason that this
[02:38:33.053 --> 02:38:35.354]  Think about it this way.
[02:38:35.354 --> 02:38:43.835]  Let's say that these subjects are actually being exposed to something that's not really going to kill them, not going to give them cancer, not even going to hurt them.
[02:38:43.835 --> 02:38:45.076]  Okay?
[02:38:45.076 --> 02:38:52.237]  And then they find out that the EPA says that it causes cancer, there's no safe level, it's toxic and lethal.
[02:38:52.237 --> 02:39:01.359]  What do you think is going to be the state of mind of a subject who took 50 bucks or 100 bucks to be a participant in one of these studies?
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:05.042]  For the rest of his life.
[02:39:05.042 --> 02:39:05.542]  Exactly.
[02:39:05.542 --> 02:39:13.969]  But of course, they're told in this article, EE News are saying, in addition to getting cash, participants are told they'll be helping humanity.
[02:39:13.969 --> 02:39:23.037]  Thanks to people like you, who've participated in studies, the EPA has set air pollutant regulations that help improve the health of millions of individuals every year.
[02:39:23.037 --> 02:39:26.099]  Your participation makes the world a better and healthier place for us all.
[02:39:26.099 --> 02:39:28.261]  So, they're not doing it just for the children.
[02:39:28.641 --> 02:39:35.284]  They're doing it for the herd, and you can lay your life down on the line for the EPA's human experimentation.
[02:39:35.284 --> 02:39:38.065]  I don't know, I just... Can I... Yes, go ahead.
[02:39:38.065 --> 02:39:39.846]  Can I interrupt just a minute on that?
[02:39:39.846 --> 02:39:40.066]  Mm-hmm.
[02:39:40.066 --> 02:39:40.806]  Okay?
[02:39:40.806 --> 02:39:54.752]  There is a specific prohibition to experiments that would cause harm to the subject, regardless of what may be some intended benefit.
[02:39:54.752 --> 02:39:55.232]  Exactly.
[02:39:55.609 --> 02:40:20.104]  The only exception to a human experiment that might harm the subject is special circumstances where there is a very serious risk that has been identified and the individuals involved in the research themselves decide to expose themselves to the potential toxin or harm.
[02:40:20.104 --> 02:40:20.564]  Yes.
[02:40:20.564 --> 02:40:23.846]  You cannot ask people from the outside to do it.
[02:40:24.776 --> 02:40:29.097]  It is prohibited and it's illegal.
[02:40:29.097 --> 02:40:40.021]  And under the common rule, which is the rule that the American federal government has adopted with regards to human experiments, there is no exception.
[02:40:40.021 --> 02:40:51.165]  There are states that have adopted codes for human experimentation, and there are international codes and guidelines on human experiments that all follow the same rule.
[02:40:51.165 --> 02:40:51.985]  You cannot
[02:40:52.845 --> 02:40:56.955]  Exposed individuals to something that might cause them harm.
[02:40:58.911 --> 02:40:59.332]  Absolutely.
[02:40:59.332 --> 02:41:04.815]  And they're not even telling them the level of risk that the EPA says that they're being exposed to.
[02:41:04.815 --> 02:41:06.295]  I mean, that's the other part of it.
[02:41:06.295 --> 02:41:12.339]  They're not informing them about the level of risk according to the EPA's published judgments.
[02:41:12.339 --> 02:41:17.121]  But as you point out, even if they did inform them, it still would be prohibited.
[02:41:17.121 --> 02:41:20.423]  It would be unethical and prohibited by the Nuremberg laws.
[02:41:20.423 --> 02:41:23.925]  Let's take a couple of callers, Dr. Dunn, who had questions.
[02:41:23.925 --> 02:41:26.467]  Let's go to Mama in Oregon.
[02:41:26.467 --> 02:41:27.047]  Go ahead, Mama.
[02:41:28.871 --> 02:41:33.835]  Hello, David, thank you for all the hard work that you do.
[02:41:33.835 --> 02:41:35.236]  Oh no, thank you for listening.
[02:41:35.236 --> 02:41:37.838]  What's your question?
[02:41:37.838 --> 02:41:51.408]  Yeah, I'm an amateur researcher and all that, but mainly, why do you think that they keep getting away with these experiments that get worse and worse?
[02:41:51.408 --> 02:41:53.370]  Mr. Knight, I can't hear a question.
[02:41:53.945 --> 02:41:55.086]  I'll repeat that for you.
[02:41:55.086 --> 02:41:58.108]  She asked, why do they keep getting away with this?
[02:41:58.108 --> 02:42:03.931]  Of course, you were part of the effort to try to get a restraining order to stop the EPA from doing these experiments.
[02:42:03.931 --> 02:42:08.795]  We found out about it at UNC in 2012.
[02:42:08.795 --> 02:42:13.858]  The judges shut that down and then we subsequently learned, as you pointed out, that they're doing it at 10 universities.
[02:42:13.858 --> 02:42:15.479]  They did it in California with children.
[02:42:15.479 --> 02:42:18.481]  Now they're back starting a new experiment in Chapel Hill.
[02:42:18.481 --> 02:42:21.583]  Her question is, why do they keep getting away with this?
[02:42:24.266 --> 02:42:28.388]  There is a tremendous amount of money involved.
[02:42:28.388 --> 02:42:41.834]  The institutional review boards are supposed to prevent this sort of experimentation at universities, schools of medicine, and other research facilities sponsored by universities.
[02:42:41.834 --> 02:42:49.758]  But you have to realize that millions of dollars are changing hands, and for every experiment that the university approves,
[02:42:50.524 --> 02:42:55.268]  They get a cut of the amount of money that's awarded.
[02:42:55.268 --> 02:42:57.830]  It's all driven by money.
[02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:59.391]  Understand this.
[02:42:59.391 --> 02:43:04.154]  The climate campaign is driven by money.
[02:43:04.154 --> 02:43:18.165]  20 billion dollars a year are being granted to people who can establish on the basis of some kind of scientific experiment or even modeling and some of that is really not very scientific.
[02:43:18.922 --> 02:43:25.306]  But what amounts to a situation where they're paying for these whores?
[02:43:25.306 --> 02:43:30.349]  And the whores are in the institutional review boards.
[02:43:30.349 --> 02:43:40.935]  I sent a letter to the 10 deans of the medical schools that are involved in these experiments and the university medical schools that are involved.
[02:43:41.616 --> 02:44:01.224]  Our University of North Carolina, Rutgers, Rochester, Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, Washington University in the state of Washington, UCLA, and University of Southern California, and the Lovelace Clinic, which is affiliated with the University of New Mexico.
[02:44:01.224 --> 02:44:08.347]  I sent a letter to the deans of all these medical schools, and I said, okay, here's the deal.
[02:44:08.996 --> 02:44:18.701]  You and your Institutional Review Board are approving experiments on humans that are illegal, unethical, and immoral.
[02:44:18.701 --> 02:44:33.168]  If you are to believe what the EPA says, which is that air pollution kills, is lethal in short or long-term ways, and it causes cancer.
[02:44:33.168 --> 02:44:34.649]  Did they reply to you?
[02:44:34.649 --> 02:44:36.230]  No, not a single one.
[02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:37.991]  Now let me tell you another thing that will really
[02:44:38.917 --> 02:44:40.298]  Irritate the devil out of you.
[02:44:40.298 --> 02:44:49.842]  There are, in the Congress of the United States, the Senate and the House, 19 positions.
[02:44:49.842 --> 02:44:53.704]  One of them is a Democrat from the state of Washington.
[02:44:53.704 --> 02:45:01.168]  His name is Jim McDermott, and he's a crazy leftist, and there's no point in me writing him a letter about anything.
[02:45:01.168 --> 02:45:04.250]  He's a psychiatrist, too, so you've got to give him a wide
[02:45:08.181 --> 02:45:19.709]  There are 18 other physicians ranging from anesthesiologists to orthopedic surgeons.
[02:45:19.709 --> 02:45:21.911]  You can think of the names of some of them.
[02:45:21.911 --> 02:45:24.152]  Rand Paul is an ophthalmologist.
[02:45:24.152 --> 02:45:27.674]  John Barrasso is an orthopedist.
[02:45:27.674 --> 02:45:35.860]  There's a fellow named Andy Harris from Maryland who's an anesthesiologist.
[02:45:37.799 --> 02:45:41.820]  Family practitioner from Georgia, Dr. Broon.
[02:45:41.820 --> 02:45:46.421]  Anyway, I wrote to all of these physicians and I said, here's what's going on.
[02:45:46.421 --> 02:45:49.021]  And we put the case there in front of them.
[02:45:49.021 --> 02:45:52.522]  And we said, we can't get the EPA to do anything.
[02:45:52.522 --> 02:46:00.744]  The judge says we don't have standing to stop the experiment because we're not being injured by the experiment.
[02:46:00.744 --> 02:46:03.905]  And so he threw the case out of court.
[02:46:03.905 --> 02:46:05.545]  But you need to do something about this.
[02:46:07.014 --> 02:46:09.276]  You want to ask your question about that, too?
[02:46:09.276 --> 02:46:09.457]  Yeah.
[02:46:09.457 --> 02:46:11.339]  You didn't hear anything from any of them, did you?
[02:46:11.339 --> 02:46:12.119]  No, I didn't.
[02:46:12.119 --> 02:46:12.600]  Yeah.
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:13.361]  No, I didn't.
[02:46:13.361 --> 02:46:14.862]  And I sent it on my letterhead.
[02:46:14.862 --> 02:46:26.074]  It wasn't like they were getting a letter from some goofball who's writing on the back of an old tablet about something that may or may not actually be happening.
[02:46:26.074 --> 02:46:29.618]  We gave them all the supportive information.
[02:46:30.157 --> 02:46:46.903]  Now, you have to remember that one of the things that I think is important, really important in terms of the evidence in this case, is I have declarations under oath by the individuals who work for the EPA who said, uh, yeah, we did it.
[02:46:46.903 --> 02:46:50.084]  And yeah, we're going to continue to do it.
[02:46:50.084 --> 02:46:58.367]  And yeah, you know, we know what you're talking about, but here's what Dr. Robert Devlin, who was the chief
[02:46:58.911 --> 02:47:02.555]  Research scientist for the University of North Carolina program.
[02:47:02.555 --> 02:47:09.684]  He said under oath Well, we know we know I'm sorry.
[02:47:09.684 --> 02:47:15.050]  We know that the epidemiology doesn't work and that it doesn't prove anything.
[02:47:15.848 --> 02:47:22.030]  Hang on, I'm going to let you get that dog under control, and I'll tell you too that I know that Dr. David Schneer also worked with us.
[02:47:22.030 --> 02:47:23.851]  He worked for a long time with the EPA.
[02:47:23.851 --> 02:47:27.332]  He was very concerned about the ethics involved here.
[02:47:27.332 --> 02:47:28.573]  We had him on the program.
[02:47:28.573 --> 02:47:30.513]  Alex Jones interviewed Dr. Schneer.
[02:47:32.074 --> 02:47:38.302]  And of course, you contacted, I know all of you contacted the medical board there in North Carolina.
[02:47:38.302 --> 02:47:47.112]  Essentially, the medical boards, the elected representatives, you point out, people who are in Congress and the Senate who are doctors, nobody seems to have a problem with this.
[02:47:47.993 --> 02:47:50.775]  And it's simply the money, as you point out.
[02:47:50.775 --> 02:48:01.204]  It's the money for the universities involved in this research program as well as the EPA and other bureaucracies like them who want to grow their little bureaucratic empire.
[02:48:01.204 --> 02:48:10.251]  It's extending power over our lives and meanwhile their partners in academia can easily be bought off regardless of the ethics issues.
[02:48:10.251 --> 02:48:14.295]  And to say that we don't have legal standing in here is just absolutely
[02:48:14.895 --> 02:48:15.475]  Not true.
[02:48:31.201 --> 02:48:34.763]  Well, you know, the important thing to understand is there are licensure laws in the states
[02:49:01.380 --> 02:49:04.341]  For any physician who has a license.
[02:49:04.341 --> 02:49:10.703]  And the licensure law is usually under the moniker of a medical practice act.
[02:49:10.703 --> 02:49:21.667]  And a medical practice act specifically requires a licensed physician to act in an ethical and moral manner.
[02:49:21.667 --> 02:49:30.210]  And we contacted the medical boards in the state of Michigan to complain about research that was done at the University of Michigan.
[02:49:30.971 --> 02:49:32.551]  And we complained.
[02:49:32.551 --> 02:49:41.013]  I wrote letters to the state medical board in North Carolina, and those positions were cleared within a month.
[02:49:41.013 --> 02:49:45.553]  Within a month, I had received a letter saying, we don't see any problem here.
[02:49:45.553 --> 02:49:47.094]  Yeah.
[02:49:47.094 --> 02:49:47.334]  Yeah.
[02:49:47.334 --> 02:49:48.454]  Money talks, doesn't it?
[02:49:48.454 --> 02:49:57.416]  That is, I think, for anybody out there who's thinking, well, gee, you know, what is it now?
[02:49:57.416 --> 02:50:00.176]  How many people are now involved who are complicit?
[02:50:01.104 --> 02:50:05.427]  An immoral and unethical human testing.
[02:50:05.427 --> 02:50:29.061]  Let's see, it's the physicians, the PhD researchers, the EPA, all the people from the EPA who send money to these different programs, the institutional review boards of the medical schools that approve the research, the deans and all the leadership of the medical schools, and the leadership and
[02:50:34.540 --> 02:50:37.682]  It's widespread corruption, isn't it, Dr. Dunn?
[02:50:37.682 --> 02:50:41.285]  It's just amazing to see the extent of this.
[02:50:41.285 --> 02:50:49.390]  We look at this in so many different aspects of our society where there is absolutely no respect for individual rights, no respect for the rule of law.
[02:50:49.390 --> 02:50:49.750]  Stay with us.
[02:50:49.750 --> 02:50:52.973]  We're going to be right back, taking your phone calls for Dr. John Dunn.
[02:50:52.973 --> 02:50:54.874]  I promise we'll get to your phone calls right after the break.
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:02.021]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[02:51:02.021 --> 02:51:03.101]  Get back to nature.

[02:52:02.017 --> 02:52:05.501]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:52:05.501 --> 02:52:11.589]  What if we the patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:52:11.589 --> 02:52:12.991]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:52:12.991 --> 02:52:13.472]  I'm all about...

[02:52:58.423 --> 02:53:00.344]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:53:00.344 --> 02:53:03.966]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:53:03.966 --> 02:53:05.327]  A pair of scissors.
[02:53:05.327 --> 02:53:11.130]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[02:53:11.130 --> 02:53:16.053]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:53:16.053 --> 02:53:17.033]  The phone line.
[02:53:17.033 --> 02:53:22.296]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:53:22.296 --> 02:53:26.018]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:53:26.178 --> 02:53:29.502]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:53:29.502 --> 02:53:31.965]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[02:53:36.330 --> 02:53:37.411]  Scissors can't cut it.

[02:54:10.069 --> 02:54:11.250]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:11.250 --> 02:54:11.850]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:11.850 --> 02:54:15.512]  I have Dr. John Dunn, physician and ethicist.
[02:54:15.512 --> 02:54:25.678]  We're talking about the EPA's human experiments, why we can't get those stopped, why they keep doing it, what it tells us about the state of America right now.
[02:54:26.078 --> 02:54:31.339]  Now I'm going to go back to your calls, try to get as many of you as I can in this last segment that we have with Dr. Dunn.
[02:54:31.339 --> 02:54:34.540]  Joanna in Kansas and Aaron in Texas who've been on hold for a long time.
[02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:37.681]  I'll try to take your calls in overdrive if you can hold on for just a little bit longer.
[02:54:37.681 --> 02:54:40.081]  Let's go right now to Chad in Washington.
[02:54:40.081 --> 02:54:43.162]  Chad?
[02:54:43.162 --> 02:54:44.983]  Thank you, David.
[02:54:44.983 --> 02:54:54.125]  I just wanted to point out on the topic of particulates, I called in earlier about geoengineering and I just want to point out that
[02:54:55.562 --> 02:55:02.254]  Regardless of what EPA says, I mean, we're all breathing in the nanoaluminum particles as well.
[02:55:02.254 --> 02:55:06.781]  So, I just wanted to make that aware, and people should research geoengineering.
[02:55:07.945 --> 02:55:09.125]  Yeah, I just want to say that
[02:55:29.312 --> 02:55:45.086]  Everything that's happening right now with geoengineering, with manipulating human DNA, with creating new entities from that, has been going on since the days of Noah in biblical times.
[02:55:45.086 --> 02:55:46.367]  This is nothing new.
[02:55:46.367 --> 02:55:48.109]  There's nothing new under the sun.
[02:55:48.109 --> 02:55:51.572]  The things that have happened in the days of Noah will happen in the days after.
[02:55:51.992 --> 02:55:57.234]  These things are all biblical prophecies that are being fulfilled till this day.
[02:55:57.234 --> 02:55:58.834]  All this stuff isn't new.
[02:55:58.834 --> 02:56:03.396]  We've learned about these things, and these things are continuing to happen.
[02:56:03.396 --> 02:56:07.077]  I just want people to know that this is nothing new.
[02:56:07.077 --> 02:56:07.757]  Absolutely.
[02:56:07.757 --> 02:56:09.618]  People, please open your eyes.
[02:56:09.618 --> 02:56:13.299]  And Alex, please, thank you so much for everything you do.
[02:56:13.299 --> 02:56:18.140]  Alex Jones, sir, if you're listening, thank you for everything you do and all the information you put out.
[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:19.581]  But people, please open your eyes.
[02:56:19.881 --> 02:56:21.762]  Thank you, William.
[02:56:21.762 --> 02:56:40.795]  It's very interesting, and of course the thing that has changed is that they do it out in the open, and as we pointed out, as Dr. Dunn pointed out, even though they complained to medical boards about the ethics of this, even though they complained to universities, to congressmen and senators who are physicians who should know better, nobody does anything to stop it.
[02:56:40.795 --> 02:56:43.156]  Let's go to Mr. Lawler in Oregon.
[02:56:43.156 --> 02:56:43.416]  Go ahead.
[02:56:46.494 --> 02:56:49.576]  Hey guys, I want to thank you for taking the call today.
[02:56:49.576 --> 02:56:59.084]  And just to be clear on the EPA, let's just know that on 9-11 they were ordered to let everyone breathe the toxic dust.
[02:56:59.084 --> 02:57:04.268]  And so to take their word for it is just like, okay, well go ahead and take your word for it and see where it gets you.
[02:57:04.676 --> 02:57:05.136]  That's true.
[02:57:05.136 --> 02:57:09.400]  They told everybody not to worry about that dust as those buildings are falling down there.
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:17.306]  We saw that a lot of people have had severe and actually have died from the consequences of the dust that they were told.
[02:57:17.306 --> 02:57:18.287]  It's just fine.
[02:57:18.287 --> 02:57:18.988]  Go ahead and go in.
[02:57:18.988 --> 02:57:19.228]  Go ahead.
[02:57:20.563 --> 02:57:33.281]  Yeah, and then on top of that, I think with the GMOs and the vaccines and the geoengineering and everything that's going on right now is kind of supercharging things on every level.
[02:57:33.281 --> 02:57:36.245]  You might take a vaccine, it will supercharge the GMO you're eating.
[02:57:37.017 --> 02:57:38.138]  Uh, who knows at this point?
[02:57:38.138 --> 02:57:39.819]  That's what I wanted to ask the doctor.
[02:57:39.819 --> 02:57:44.262]  Is there any link between those things that can supercharge each other?
[02:57:44.262 --> 02:57:53.349]  And then on second of all, uh, why take any of these Fox News or CNN commercials for every single commercial they have on there?
[02:57:53.349 --> 02:57:55.471]  Pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:57:55.471 --> 02:57:56.992]  And then on top of that, to make it worse,
[02:57:57.632 --> 02:58:00.313]  Let's focus on what we're talking about today.
[02:58:00.313 --> 02:58:04.773]  And what we're talking about today is something that's pretty straightforward.
[02:58:04.773 --> 02:58:05.053]  EPA claims
[02:58:24.065 --> 02:58:33.693]  That air pollutants are lethal, toxic, and cause cancer, and yet, they're exposing people to those air pollutants in the lab.
[02:58:33.693 --> 02:58:39.418]  Either they're lying about toxicity, or they're lying to the people that... Absolutely right.
[02:58:39.418 --> 02:58:40.379]  Thank you, Dr. Dunn.
[02:58:40.379 --> 02:58:41.580]  JunkScience.com.
[02:58:41.580 --> 02:58:42.781]  Stay with us right after the break.
[02:58:42.781 --> 02:58:44.523]  We're gonna be back in overdrive with your calls.
[02:58:44.523 --> 02:58:44.863]  Thank you.
[02:58:49.246 --> 02:58:52.627]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:58:52.627 --> 02:58:56.148]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:58:56.148 --> 02:59:02.210]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:59:02.210 --> 02:59:03.610]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:59:03.610 --> 02:59:05.731]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:59:05.831 --> 02:59:07.393]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:59:07.393 --> 02:59:12.198]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:59:12.198 --> 02:59:16.783]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[02:59:16.783 --> 02:59:20.828]  How we can come together and win the human race and celebrate the kickoff of human
[02:59:20.848 --> 02:59:21.208]  We're good.
[02:59:51.764 --> 02:59:54.374]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:11.625 --> 03:00:13.147]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:13.147 --> 03:00:15.551]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:00:15.551 --> 03:00:20.718]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:20.718 --> 03:00:24.384]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:27.970 --> 03:00:29.231]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:29.231 --> 03:00:29.551]  I'm David.
[03:00:29.551 --> 03:00:32.854]  I don't want to take a couple of callers who are waiting to talk to Paul.
[03:00:32.854 --> 03:00:37.198]  They've been very patient and hung on for over an hour.
[03:00:37.198 --> 03:00:39.399]  Joanna in Kansas and Aaron in Texas.
[03:00:39.399 --> 03:00:42.802]  And just to put a book in on what Dr. Dunn was telling us.
[03:00:43.723 --> 03:00:49.206]  I just find it absolutely amazing that these people who used to, and of course it's been going on for a very long time.
[03:00:49.206 --> 03:00:53.849]  We've got the famous Tuskegee experiments, but of course there's the CIA experiments.
[03:00:53.849 --> 03:00:58.472]  So many things that have been done for so many decades, but they did them in the shadows.
[03:00:58.472 --> 03:00:59.733]  They did them in the dark.
[03:01:00.473 --> 03:01:02.214]  Now they no longer care.
[03:01:02.214 --> 03:01:13.799]  Even when you call them out on it, even when you point out that they are doing things for which there is no ethical justification in violation of criminal laws, they continue to do it.
[03:01:13.799 --> 03:01:15.879]  And we don't get any help from the medical boards.
[03:01:15.879 --> 03:01:20.481]  We certainly don't get any help from the universities that are participating in this and profiting from it.
[03:01:22.142 --> 03:01:31.746]  Bureaucracy, the EPA, which is constantly trying to extend its jurisdiction, extends it into saying that they own all the water anywhere, going into the cases.
[03:01:31.746 --> 03:01:38.208]  I don't want to go down that whole rabbit trail, but they have tried to exert authority over people's ponds.
[03:01:38.348 --> 03:01:38.708]  That's right.
[03:02:09.589 --> 03:02:10.830]  Oh yeah, thank you very much.
[03:02:10.830 --> 03:02:12.671]  I appreciate the time.
[03:02:12.671 --> 03:02:19.897]  Real brief, I'd like to challenge a few things that you said, but commented about our
[03:02:20.567 --> 03:02:29.994]  Our authority figures, the doctors and scientists, are doing these things without our permission and not requiring our consent.
[03:02:29.994 --> 03:02:37.379]  And I question that, because... You question whether they're doing that or whether we should just let them tell us what to do?
[03:02:37.379 --> 03:02:42.843]  No, I'm saying that we are giving them consent.
[03:02:42.843 --> 03:02:46.606]  In our own ways, we are actually allowing them to do this.
[03:02:46.606 --> 03:02:46.966]  Good point.
[03:02:48.047 --> 03:02:53.328]  Yeah, I mean there's nothing that's gone on now that has not taken into consideration.
[03:02:53.328 --> 03:03:05.512]  If you take a look at what's been going on in terms of vaccinations and experiments, it usually winds up happening to groups of people or cultures that have been deemed unacceptable or
[03:03:07.467 --> 03:03:10.450]  Not a part of the mainstream.
[03:03:10.450 --> 03:03:12.332]  That's a very good point.
[03:03:12.332 --> 03:03:13.613]  They have contempt for us.
[03:03:13.613 --> 03:03:19.959]  They think that we're primitives and they can get away with anything that they want to do and of course the Constitution is not self-enforcing is it?
[03:03:21.067 --> 03:03:21.828]  Absolutely.
[03:03:21.828 --> 03:03:41.482]  So if you take a look at everything that's taken place from the Nazis and the Jewish nation, and you go all the way up to Tuskegee, it just seems like everyone that is being experimented on has been deemed unworthy or not worth the time or energy.
[03:03:41.482 --> 03:03:48.567]  And one of the questions that I wanted to ask the doctor, because he had listed a number of the places where these experiments were taking place.
[03:03:49.888 --> 03:03:57.491]  I would like him to tell us what is the population of these areas that he's named.
[03:03:57.491 --> 03:04:03.113]  I mean, what is the cultural makeup of these areas where these experiments are taking place?
[03:04:03.113 --> 03:04:10.816]  Well, Joanna, we know that this most recent one, they're targeting asthmatic African-American teenagers.
[03:04:10.816 --> 03:04:13.397]  That's the demographic that they're going for in Raleigh now with this newest test.
[03:04:14.355 --> 03:04:21.120]  And I'm black, so I'm all ready to, like, either get in line or wait for my gift card or whatever, you know?
[03:04:21.120 --> 03:04:37.032]  I mean, seriously, the whole idea of it is based upon this very liberal agenda that clearly separates people according to race, gender, value, etc., etc.
[03:04:37.032 --> 03:04:41.675]  And we also should be taking a look at what FEMA is, what part FEMA is going to play in this.
[03:04:41.715 --> 03:04:42.395]  Very good point.
[03:04:42.395 --> 03:04:43.215]  We're out of time.
[03:04:43.215 --> 03:04:45.116]  Thank you for holding for so long, Joanna.
[03:04:45.116 --> 03:04:47.417]  Aaron in Texas, I'm sorry if you call us tomorrow.
[03:04:47.417 --> 03:04:49.017]  I'm sure they'll put you at the front of the line.
[03:04:49.017 --> 03:04:49.978]  I'm sorry you held for so long.
[03:04:49.978 --> 03:04:51.438]  I wasn't able to get to you.
[03:04:51.438 --> 03:04:52.738]  That's it for today's show.
[03:04:52.738 --> 03:04:55.639]  Join us tonight, 7 central, for the nightly news.
[03:04:55.639 --> 03:04:57.040]  Alex Jones will be with us tomorrow.
