[00:00.000 --> 00:12.300]  Ladies and gentlemen it's 145 days out from the 2020 election and the
[00:12.300 --> 00:16.900]  globalist forces are throwing everything they've got at us. So strap
[00:16.900 --> 00:21.700]  yourselves in it's gonna be an insane time. We are gonna be broadcasting for
[00:21.700 --> 00:26.060]  the next four hours worldwide and this is one hell of a transmission. Your
[00:26.060 --> 00:29.580]  special guest in studio a neocon coup plot against President Trump has been
[00:29.580 --> 00:35.360]  discovered will exclusively lay it out in so much more here today but first this
[00:35.360 --> 00:40.760]  video report was up on YouTube less than two hours on a separate channel and was
[00:40.760 --> 00:45.640]  taken down for community guidelines violations. Instagram is banning FBI
[00:45.640 --> 00:49.240]  statistics as well because they're covering up the giant truth that
[00:49.240 --> 00:53.880]  destroys their lives. Here is the report exclusively at Band-Aid video.
[00:53.880 --> 01:00.900]  Black Lives Matter is a lie. There is no genocide of young innocent black men.
[01:00.900 --> 01:07.860]  In 2019 there were only 10 cases in which unarmed African-Americans were
[01:07.860 --> 01:13.560]  fatally shot by the police. In five out of 10 cases an officer was attacked
[01:13.560 --> 01:18.860]  just before the shooting and in two of the remaining four the officer was
[01:18.860 --> 01:26.680]  criminally charged. Where is the injustice? Also in 2019 there were 25
[01:26.680 --> 01:32.200]  unarmed white Americans who were fatally shot by the police. According to
[01:32.200 --> 01:38.000]  FBI statistics even though African-Americans make up only 13% of
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.900]  the population they commit over 50% of all murder in America. Blacks kill 10
[01:44.900 --> 01:50.880]  times the amount of whites as whites kill blacks and a police officer is 18
[01:50.880 --> 01:55.600]  and a half times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.280]  black male is to be killed by a police officer. Black Lives Matter has been a
[02:01.280 --> 02:07.800]  lie since its very beginning. In 2013 the movement began on social media after
[02:07.800 --> 02:12.720]  the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin but
[02:12.720 --> 02:18.160]  the case against Zimmerman was a lie. The prosecution had used an imposter as a
[02:18.160 --> 02:23.040]  fake witness who they claimed wrote the only piece of criminal evidence they had
[02:23.040 --> 02:29.220]  a letter that the fake witness admitted under oath to not writing. Founded by
[02:29.220 --> 02:34.200]  known communists and fueled with millions of dollars from George Soros
[02:34.200 --> 02:40.480]  Black Lives Matter organized riots in Ferguson, Baltimore and Chicago and
[02:40.480 --> 02:45.880]  began recruiting an army of haters hiding beneath the guise of social
[02:45.880 --> 02:52.960]  justice. The entire foundation of Black Lives Matter is an obvious lie and yet
[02:52.960 --> 02:57.760]  the lie sells. It sells because communities have been broken by
[02:57.760 --> 03:04.240]  government programs such as LBJ's war on poverty that incentivize this full
[03:04.240 --> 03:10.040]  report is on band.video and we're gonna be airing it in full coming up at the
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.520]  bottom of the hour on all of our radio and TV stations but let's put the article
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.960]  up there it is YouTube deletes video exposing FBI stats on black crime and
[03:19.960 --> 03:24.800]  here we have the community guidelines announcement that well the communist
[03:24.800 --> 03:29.600]  community complaining doesn't like your video Black Lives Matter as a globalist
[03:29.600 --> 03:39.480]  trojan horse and so that's a strike against you. So that's how the system
[03:39.480 --> 03:43.880]  operates you show FBI numbers you show it's incredibly rare for a police
[03:43.880 --> 03:51.840]  officer to shoot and killed an unarmed black person and well your band but I'm
[03:51.840 --> 03:55.680]  gonna add an addendum to this where the fact there is a genocide against black
[03:55.680 --> 03:59.000]  babies by the left and Planned Parenthood the same group that funds
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.800]  Black Lives Matter through Soros. By the way all of the United States American
[04:03.800 --> 04:08.280]  flags are now being grabbed and burned off homes at CBS News this is the
[04:08.280 --> 04:12.840]  operating system of the left they are cancer and they are attempting their
[04:12.840 --> 04:21.200]  takeover right now so that's all coming up today also we have a really great
[04:21.200 --> 04:24.840]  researcher who's got a lot of sources inside the Republican National Committee
[04:24.840 --> 04:28.840]  you know most of this is public information already but we're gonna
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.000]  have some exclusive information at the bottom of the second hour with Richard
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.240]  Reeves in studio we have discovered the neocon coup plan they are officially
[04:36.240 --> 04:43.120]  gonna be launching soon to not have Trump get the nomination coming up in
[04:43.120 --> 04:46.600]  Jacksonville it looks like they're gonna move it for North Carolina that's all
[04:46.600 --> 04:51.600]  coming up as well with one four five out scrap yourselves in because it's gonna
[04:51.600 --> 04:59.000]  be a one hell of a rough ride and by the way there are no spectators it's
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.800]  finally here introducing the new survival shield X2 spray available now for

[06:13.840 --> 06:23.680]  145 days 145 rotations of the earth as we spin around the Sun until the
[06:23.680 --> 06:28.280]  historic election with the forces of globalism are throwing everything they
[06:28.280 --> 06:32.680]  have at our president and at the American people to shut down the economy
[06:32.680 --> 06:38.760]  bankrupt the nation under siege under terrorism until we finally bow and get
[06:38.760 --> 06:43.800]  on our knees to their globalist agenda thank you so much for joining us today
[06:43.800 --> 06:47.800]  coming up when I start the next hour we've done an investigation into this
[06:47.800 --> 06:52.480]  old 70-year-old man that supposedly got pushed over by the police for no reason
[06:52.480 --> 06:57.800]  and that Trump's been questioning as a type of false flag you've gone to the
[06:57.800 --> 07:02.880]  raw footage looked at it very very closely and we'll give you our findings
[07:02.880 --> 07:09.400]  coming up at the start of the next hour then Richard Reeves will be joining us in
[07:09.400 --> 07:13.320]  studio he's been at the delegate level worked in Republican Party for many many
[07:13.320 --> 07:19.040]  years first person ever told me that Trump would run for president in 2016
[07:19.040 --> 07:25.480]  when he told me that like in 2012 smart guy has a lot of sources inside the RNC
[07:25.480 --> 07:29.600]  and he's been telling me for months that Romney and others are gonna try to
[07:29.600 --> 07:33.920]  steal the nomination by blocking it and they have a procedure to do that at the
[07:33.920 --> 07:37.960]  RNC event coming up now they're saying they're gonna have it in Jacksonville
[07:37.960 --> 07:45.120]  not in North Carolina but in Florida but that's not official yet well he was
[07:45.120 --> 07:47.960]  telling me that months ago he's on air months ago saying that now they're
[07:47.960 --> 07:52.200]  officially beginning the groundwork to do it and they can do it if people aren't
[07:52.200 --> 07:56.720]  aware procedurally how to block it the person that blocked it last time was of
[07:56.720 --> 08:03.120]  course mr. Manafort he was rewarded with prison time and is now on house arrest
[08:03.120 --> 08:08.280]  like I guess so many other people in blue states and blue cities but he's out of
[08:08.280 --> 08:13.600]  prisons serving out the remainder of his term at home anyone that helped get
[08:13.600 --> 08:17.240]  Trump elected at a high level has been persecuted has been targeted because the
[08:17.240 --> 08:23.760]  globalists know we are the seeds of their corrupt systems downfall but it does
[08:23.760 --> 08:28.200]  not make it any more fun to be their target but the fruit of the labor and
[08:28.200 --> 08:33.680]  the torture is certainly sweet and so in the end game we win the new order to
[08:33.680 --> 08:39.280]  lose this so that's all coming up quite a transmission lined up for you today we
[08:39.280 --> 08:42.000]  have several other guests will be telling you about and John Robport's gonna
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.680]  be on and he is really fired up in the fourth hour let me do this first though
[08:49.680 --> 08:55.600]  when we come back the transparency of the deep state saying they wanted to
[08:55.600 --> 08:59.040]  crash the economy to punish the American people for supporting President
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.360]  Trump is incredible and now they admit that's the plan and they're hoping to
[09:03.360 --> 09:06.560]  keep the economy suppressed and they're hoping that even if the economy stays
[09:06.560 --> 09:11.720]  suppressed we're gonna blame Trump they treat us like we're completely stupid I
[09:11.720 --> 09:16.280]  keep projecting my intelligence on to the public hoping that a lot of folks
[09:16.280 --> 09:20.040]  out there are savvy some folks are smarter than me quite a few aren't I'm
[09:20.040 --> 09:23.840]  not pleased by that the globalists are very happy there's so many dumb people
[09:23.840 --> 09:27.440]  they can rule over them but if we're ever gonna defeat the system we've got to
[09:27.440 --> 09:32.360]  get people informed and engaged and believing it's important to not be a
[09:32.360 --> 09:39.680]  chump that said Fauci says oh COVID-19 is the worst thing on earth and that we've
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.760]  got to spike in cases as more testing goes out and that we've got to just keep
[09:43.760 --> 09:48.680]  the economy shut permanently no one points out that he set up the lab nobody
[09:48.680 --> 09:52.040]  points out that he and Bill Gates have their fingers all over it nobody points
[09:52.040 --> 09:55.520]  out they're calling all the regular deaths COVID-19 nobody points out
[09:55.520 --> 10:02.280]  they're making massive amounts of money off this it's insane and so we have to
[10:02.280 --> 10:06.600]  keep beating the drum on COVID-19 to push back that hoax that's why they
[10:06.600 --> 10:10.880]  launched this whole race riot garbage as the next part of their offensive to
[10:10.880 --> 10:15.400]  distract from the power grab that was the COVID-19 fraud so that's coming up
[10:15.400 --> 10:22.440]  Los Angeles homicide rose to 50% shooting 56% during protest week and of
[10:22.440 --> 10:25.760]  course many of the deaths were black but they won't personalize any of those
[10:25.760 --> 10:32.040]  folks that died it's all about the evil white people that's 22 trillion stock
[10:32.040 --> 10:37.680]  rally now hinges on rapid economic recovery mainstream media like Yahoo
[10:37.680 --> 10:41.280]  Finance promotes the crash of the dollar they say it's coming it's all over
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.840]  Dr. Fauci calls coronavirus his worst nightmare and says pandemic is far from
[10:45.840 --> 10:52.800]  over as many as 25,000 US stores may close in 2020 mostly in malls here's a
[10:52.800 --> 10:58.920]  big one food shortages loom with outbreaks at 16 US plants the looming bank
[10:58.920 --> 11:02.120]  collapse that's out of the Atlantic that's be the big banks taking over all
[11:02.120 --> 11:08.640]  your local banks so much more we're gonna be breaking down on that front now
[11:08.640 --> 11:14.280]  they're trying to torpedo the president when we come back but the first thing I
[11:14.280 --> 11:19.200]  want to hit is this I've been telling listeners for four or five months you
[11:19.200 --> 11:22.600]  need to get storeable food not because of coronavirus but because of the lock
[11:22.600 --> 11:25.840]  down in the economy that they were gonna have which they had which is still
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.440]  ongoing blue states and blue cities have no intention of ever reopening even if
[11:30.440 --> 11:34.000]  they get back in full power they want you suppressed they want you bankrupted
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.440]  they want to totally implode everything to buy it all up for pennies on the
[11:37.440 --> 11:44.440]  dollar and to get huge federal bailouts which they steal that's that's why they
[11:44.440 --> 11:48.800]  mismanage things by design they're not mismanaging it they are skimming things
[11:48.800 --> 11:56.040]  down to the bone well this is out of MSM and Bloomberg more food shortages loom
[11:56.040 --> 12:02.440]  with outbreaks at 60 US plants oh my gosh oh my gosh they did testing
[12:02.440 --> 12:07.560]  everybody's a a symptomatic they have plants with thousands of people tested no
[12:07.560 --> 12:14.200]  one is sick but they'll say oh 350 people or 600 people oh you've seen the
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.040]  stories there they've got COVID-19 we've got to close and lawyers are putting up
[12:19.040 --> 12:23.480]  billboards outside the meat-backing plant saying did you have COVID call us did
[12:23.480 --> 12:33.800]  they make you work make you work what is even me and now the food shortages are
[12:33.800 --> 12:37.280]  beginning and the food prices are going up and the meat quality isn't good
[12:37.280 --> 12:41.600]  because we've been sabotaged and if the globalist are successful shut the
[12:41.600 --> 12:47.120]  economy off and we have a prolonged oppression Katie bar the door that's
[12:47.120 --> 12:51.280]  why I've been saying to listeners even after the COVID hoax was proven to be
[12:51.280 --> 12:55.400]  one that the aftershocks of it and the ongoing strangulation of the West is
[12:55.400 --> 12:59.760]  only an intensify that's why while you still have time hope for the best
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.440]  prepare for the worst maybe this turns around we have a soft crash landing but
[13:04.440 --> 13:09.120]  it goes from there as the best scenario into just road warrior total collapse
[13:09.120 --> 13:13.240]  because the instincts of the globalist are they can't stop undermining and
[13:13.240 --> 13:17.680]  stealing and robbing and because they they just they love doing it even though
[13:17.680 --> 13:23.160]  they're having to build armored fortresses in Hawaii and in New Zealand
[13:23.160 --> 13:25.920]  and other areas and they believe that they destroyed everything and it's all
[13:25.920 --> 13:29.200]  gonna collapse they believe they're gonna sit out there while all collapses from
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.040]  a distance is the planned implosion that's why it's so vital to expose them
[13:34.040 --> 13:37.800]  during the collapse so that they don't come out on top in the end this is a
[13:37.800 --> 13:43.840]  long war as they say it under strange love mr. president we cannot allow a
[13:43.840 --> 13:51.200]  mine shaft gap now I want to tell listeners about this I was talking to
[13:51.200 --> 13:54.880]  my Patriot supplier great suppliers and I was talking to him last week they
[13:54.880 --> 13:59.320]  said well we're really down to two weeks on most deliveries now I said I'm
[13:59.320 --> 14:02.040]  gonna tell people that they said well some specialty foods and things it's
[14:02.040 --> 14:07.800]  still six weeks and so I talked to the owner I talked to the CEO yesterday
[14:07.800 --> 14:14.120]  today my crew did they said fine you can now say four weeks on average for
[14:14.120 --> 14:18.240]  storeable food it's the highest quality they've got it they've got four plants in
[14:18.240 --> 14:20.960]  the US depending on what you order depending on how fast you get it but
[14:20.960 --> 14:25.800]  really the average is like three weeks I just said say four under promise over
[14:25.800 --> 14:30.560]  deliver the rave reviews five star reviews at m4store.com we have their
[14:30.560 --> 14:34.320]  whole catalog they're in our back end they take the orders it goes right to you
[14:34.320 --> 14:39.280]  in the queue where your order comes in and use this little rest we have caught
[14:39.280 --> 14:42.440]  in the current to come up to the service get some air before you get sucked
[14:42.440 --> 14:46.800]  back down I personally am ordering more storeable food I personally have gotten
[14:46.800 --> 14:50.360]  a place out in the country which I never did we have family land in East Texas
[14:50.360 --> 14:55.400]  but I never actually moved out and got a place in the middle of the countryside
[14:55.400 --> 15:00.280]  I've done that now I'm putting a trailer on it you know in a water well and in
[15:00.280 --> 15:05.560]  some solar panels because it's bad folks and I have to now start going into
[15:05.560 --> 15:11.240]  defense posture 80% offense but I've always been 100% offense trying to fully
[15:11.240 --> 15:14.560]  you know stop the globalists and we've given them a good run and I think down
[15:14.560 --> 15:18.880]  the road they'll be defeated but we are gonna still go down the hard road now
[15:18.880 --> 15:23.640]  there were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down but we've mitigated some
[15:23.640 --> 15:26.560]  of this but it's it's still gonna be bad my view you need to get high quality
[15:26.560 --> 15:30.000]  storeable food it's something you need we have high quality ready to get out to
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.280]  you and it supports the broadcast of 360 wins so please take carrier

[15:38.720 --> 15:42.920]  it so you have it some great containers high quality last 25 years get it while
[15:42.920 --> 15:46.080]  you can because if you think things are about to let up you ain't seen nothing
[15:46.080 --> 15:49.960]  yet they just sent more US aircraft carriers of the South China Sea as
[15:49.960 --> 15:54.720]  everything goes into overdrive a lot of crazies is unfolding strap yourselves in
[15:54.720 --> 15:58.480]  we'll be right back I'm always excited about info war's life products they're
[15:58.480 --> 16:01.200]  amazing they're cutting edge you love them I love them and they found the
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.840]  info war in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new
[16:05.840 --> 16:13.560]  product over a year in development that is amazing the only organic hand
[16:13.560 --> 16:19.040]  sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it and there's
[16:19.040 --> 16:25.000]  another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.640]  gross goo but it's high quality and aerosolized is it in a really great way
[16:30.640 --> 16:34.840]  I like to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic
[16:34.840 --> 16:39.040]  alcohol in it so spray it right in your eyes but I just love it personally has
[16:39.040 --> 16:43.160]  something that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real innovation I don't know
[16:43.160 --> 16:46.960]  why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has

[18:41.480 --> 18:46.960]  screen something David Knight taking off today to the at the dentist just like I
[18:46.960 --> 18:50.560]  was doing yesterday for part of the day tweeted this out this morning imagine
[18:50.560 --> 18:58.440]  being shown this photo in 2019 with no explanation and if you're a radio
[18:58.440 --> 19:05.440]  listener it is Nancy Pelosi and the guy that thinks that Guam and islands float
[19:05.440 --> 19:11.760]  behind him behind her and then you've got Chuck E. Schumer the intelligence
[19:11.760 --> 19:17.840]  agencies have seven ways for Sunday to get the president and they're all up
[19:17.840 --> 19:29.360]  there wearing their COVID mask with their Kwanzaa scarves acting powerful this is
[19:29.360 --> 19:35.000]  what it's like to live in a giant cult and the big mega banks the big mega tech
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.560]  companies that work always authoritarian countries they're just used to
[19:37.560 --> 19:42.080]  winning and they're used to having people that are compliant and subservient
[19:42.080 --> 19:45.800]  and that go along with them and right now you're being told Neil you're being
[19:45.800 --> 19:49.280]  told wear a mask you're being told ignore all the statistics that COVID-19 was a
[19:49.280 --> 19:54.120]  total hoax you're being told that it's now Trump's fault when they were the
[19:54.120 --> 19:58.800]  ones saying two years ago and a year ago and six months ago in December
[19:58.800 --> 20:03.160]  breathlessly Bill Maher we've got to have a depression we've got to smash the
[20:03.160 --> 20:07.120]  economy to teach this guy and I'm like do they think we're that dumb that if
[20:07.120 --> 20:11.840]  they smash the economy somehow if they dynamite the bridge that the Trump
[20:11.840 --> 20:16.200]  train's going down when we reach the river they dynamite it like Wiley
[20:16.200 --> 20:20.240]  coyote and then we blame Trump the conductor because the train goes into
[20:20.240 --> 20:28.240]  the river I guess they think that and I keep projecting my intelligence on to
[20:28.240 --> 20:34.080]  people I was sitting there this weekend out on this little farm I bought outside
[20:34.080 --> 20:41.000]  town and I was sitting there looking at a cow that leases the property of the
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.280]  owner of the cow and it looked kind of smart they're looking at me but I knew
[20:45.280 --> 20:50.480]  it wasn't smart it's very stupid and I was projecting my thoughts onto the cow
[20:50.480 --> 20:55.080]  and so much the time the public you try to tell them things and I think you're
[20:55.080 --> 20:57.800]  showing off because you know something or it's it's like weird it's like an
[20:57.800 --> 21:04.600]  idiocracy set in the future 200 years where the IQ average is about 70 and so
[21:04.600 --> 21:09.680]  just an average person in the future that this is suspended animation wakes up
[21:09.680 --> 21:15.520]  as the smartest person in the world we're not waiting to get there 200 years
[21:15.520 --> 21:22.280]  we're we're here ladies and gentlemen they are again attacking the Lincoln
[21:22.280 --> 21:29.520]  Memorial they're attacking the black civil war soldier memorial for the north
[21:29.520 --> 21:34.960]  they're attacking the British Prime Minister that had England go to war with
[21:34.960 --> 21:39.440]  a bunch of countries to end slavery and they are totally ignorant but does it
[21:39.440 --> 21:43.480]  matter because the media is on their side and Tucker Carlson's been pointing
[21:43.480 --> 21:51.000]  all of that out that's coming up next segment but what I wanted to hit now was
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.960]  how they're going after the president look at these headlines
[21:53.960 --> 21:59.640]  Politico breathlessly White House goes quiet on coronavirus as outbreak spikes
[21:59.640 --> 22:05.040]  again across the US we've done more testing than all countries combined and
[22:05.040 --> 22:08.720]  these companies are told by their lawyers by their insurance companies do
[22:08.720 --> 22:13.960]  the right thing test for COVID and then they test and almost all the tests are
[22:13.960 --> 22:17.480]  fraudulent with false positives if you've had the flu or a cold the last 10
[22:17.480 --> 22:22.080]  years and then oh my gosh the whole company needs to shut down and you've
[22:22.080 --> 22:25.320]  got a self quarantine and oh we've got it and they're testing meat packing
[22:25.320 --> 22:30.240]  plants and in some cases half the people have COVID-19 and they don't and then
[22:30.240 --> 22:37.400]  there's the headline AP 300 plus test positive at cargo plant all asymptomatic
[22:37.400 --> 22:43.240]  because they don't have it but Bill Gates is Chinese controlled firm churned
[22:43.240 --> 22:51.760]  out tens of millions of tests before the FDA shut it down because it's a fraud the
[22:51.760 --> 22:56.080]  whole thing is run by the people that control him systematic organized
[22:56.080 --> 23:01.640]  orchestrated choreographed crime every time the Democrats sue me they always
[23:01.640 --> 23:05.120]  want we want the secret documents we want the battle plan we want the doctrine
[23:05.120 --> 23:10.440]  we want who gives you orders I'm not like you I'm smart I'm informed I'm in
[23:10.440 --> 23:14.200]  the information I remember all this stuff there's nobody giving the orders
[23:14.200 --> 23:19.440]  dumbasses I give the orders and that's what you followers don't understand I'm
[23:19.440 --> 23:22.440]  not talking to the audience of activists who aren't followers I mean the
[23:22.440 --> 23:27.320]  establishment types you are all slaves you follow globalist orders you think
[23:27.320 --> 23:33.400]  I'm following orders from some man I'm following orders from God that's who I
[23:33.400 --> 23:39.200]  about to in the middle of the night in the still of the night in the place of
[23:39.200 --> 23:44.800]  the most high not you you do not have the spirit of enlightenment you have none
[23:44.800 --> 23:47.920]  of it and we have to stop looking at the globals that are powerful they're
[23:47.920 --> 23:52.320]  amazing they're just fallen criminals like cancer willing to go against God's
[23:52.320 --> 23:58.040]  law that's why they're in control of the planet because Satan's been given
[23:58.040 --> 24:04.080]  control of the planet they're ugly they're stupid they're mindless the
[24:04.080 --> 24:06.840]  leadership of the new world order and what do they want they want the
[24:06.840 --> 24:12.080]  innocence that's what these demons feed upon that's their quarry that's their
[24:12.080 --> 24:18.760]  target and no amount of groveling or submitting to them will ever make them
[24:18.760 --> 24:25.640]  happy it'll only make them want more more more so the White House now knows
[24:25.640 --> 24:28.760]  it's a total fraud that he wasn't watching his flank the medical tyranny
[24:28.760 --> 24:32.440]  foul chief for Bill Gates Bill Gates acted like he was Trump's friend
[24:32.440 --> 24:37.000]  signaled up to him and now they're saying oh we can't reopen just like we said
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.800]  oh no governor Newsom says still can't go to the beach oh no sorry we're by the
[24:41.800 --> 24:46.480]  way I learned a bunch of other Democrat states are sending old people to their
[24:46.480 --> 24:52.880]  deaths by sending people with the flu or pneumonia calling it COVID into them so
[24:52.880 --> 24:59.080]  they get that higher death number still because it was peaking three weeks ago
[24:59.080 --> 25:02.400]  that oh they're killing old people oh they're criminals something should be
[25:02.400 --> 25:05.520]  done oh it's all a hoax oh and then there's always something wrong with the
[25:05.520 --> 25:14.160]  cops millions of police 350 million Americans they took that Floyd case
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.360]  hyped it up drove it the media energized it to distract from everything else
[25:19.360 --> 25:27.160]  that's going on look at this headline out of variety the country is doomed hear
[25:27.160 --> 25:31.680]  that abandon ship they want to kill your confidence and they going to say it's
[25:31.680 --> 25:39.240]  Trump's fault America's going down Trump's 2020 path gets trickier with tag as
[25:39.240 --> 25:46.120]  recession president oh that's right it's all Trump's fault everything is
[25:46.120 --> 25:50.720]  president Trump's fault Trump make him pair himself to Nixon in 68 but he's
[25:50.720 --> 25:54.280]  really resembles Wallace
[25:55.080 --> 25:59.880]  Trump brings back his 2016 veterans as his campaign makes aggressive turn and
[25:59.880 --> 26:06.880]  yes talk about a war on logic NPR CNN they're all attacking Trump for saying
[26:06.880 --> 26:11.840]  he's gonna have his rallies as dangerous as murderous as criminal as illegal as
[26:11.840 --> 26:17.760]  need to be blocked and stopped and call the police oh but it's so good to go out
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.760]  and burn things and attack people in their cars and the man in Colorado that
[26:22.760 --> 26:26.320]  just pulled up to his four-way stop weird white lawyer shot him in the head
[26:26.320 --> 26:32.520]  he's in life support probably gonna die but you'll never know his name because
[26:32.520 --> 26:37.280]  he's not one of the special people the media is gonna hype up and talk about
[26:37.280 --> 26:40.960]  they won't talk about the homicide soaring 250 percent since this whole
[26:40.960 --> 26:44.920]  kill the police thing started that's all who needs the police oh but you do need
[26:44.920 --> 26:49.400]  him to enforce illegal lockdowns and face masks they can't go to the beach but
[26:49.400 --> 26:52.760]  we should still disband them double-think two plus two equals a hundred
[26:52.760 --> 27:02.000]  total mental illness what our champions made of here's a man who can show you

[30:22.460 --> 30:24.380]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[30:24.380 --> 30:30.300]  There is now no longer any doubt that the UN global government
[30:30.300 --> 30:33.020]  is out in the open, and it's using COVID-19
[30:33.020 --> 30:35.140]  to reveal itself and take full control, giving us
[30:35.140 --> 30:36.980]  all planetary ID numbers.
[30:36.980 --> 30:39.220]  They'll be used to track and trace and control
[30:39.220 --> 30:40.660]  our every movement.
[30:40.660 --> 30:44.260]  The censorship that we started seeing after Trump won three
[30:44.260 --> 30:48.220]  and a half years ago is up a billion percent.
[30:48.220 --> 30:50.780]  I mean, it's just everyone's being censored.
[30:50.780 --> 30:52.580]  Everything's being blocked.
[30:52.580 --> 30:56.180]  Every old movie, TV show, books, films.
[30:56.180 --> 30:59.300]  Everything's being digitally erased and burned.
[30:59.300 --> 31:01.620]  We're going to be covering that coming up next segment
[31:01.620 --> 31:02.820]  with Gregory's in studio.

[31:14.060 --> 31:16.340]  It is so precious when you decide to share
[31:16.340 --> 31:17.980]  the articles and the videos.
[31:17.980 --> 31:25.340]  It is so precious when you realize you are the power
[31:25.340 --> 31:30.700]  and that you're taking action is absolutely everything.
[31:30.700 --> 31:32.260]  It's not just some little side thing.

[31:37.580 --> 31:40.780]  as an individual, you deciding to spread the word
[31:40.780 --> 31:44.660]  as the modern Paul Revere changes everything.
[31:44.660 --> 31:47.620]  And Big Tech is going after all the big server companies.
[31:47.620 --> 31:48.940]  They're buying them up.
[31:48.940 --> 31:51.860]  Microsoft has bought tens of thousands of companies.
[31:51.860 --> 31:53.820]  Google has bought thousands of companies.
[31:53.820 --> 31:55.580]  Apple's buying thousands.
[31:55.580 --> 31:57.500]  Twitter's buying hundreds.
[31:57.500 --> 31:59.980]  And they're buying up all the payment processors
[31:59.980 --> 32:02.300]  and all the server companies and all the software companies.
[32:02.300 --> 32:05.540]  And they're going in now and blacklisting organizations
[32:05.540 --> 32:09.060]  and groups, including the Republican Party,
[32:09.060 --> 32:10.660]  and saying, you're not allowed to operate.
[32:10.660 --> 32:13.540]  I have stacks of news we'll cover next segment.
[32:13.540 --> 32:18.100]  And then in the third dimension on the ground,
[32:18.100 --> 32:22.260]  Antifa is going up to cars of white people
[32:22.260 --> 32:23.420]  on highways and roads.
[32:23.420 --> 32:27.100]  And if you don't bow and plead and worship them,
[32:27.100 --> 32:31.380]  you are physically being attacked.
[32:31.380 --> 32:32.420]  That's what's going on.
[32:32.420 --> 32:35.060]  And then after they climb up and try to kill you,
[32:35.060 --> 32:37.860]  they call the police and say, you attacked them.
[32:37.860 --> 32:44.620]  The mainstream media praised it when they climbed up
[32:44.620 --> 32:48.500]  on our armored vehicle with a rock hammer, a spike hammer,
[32:48.500 --> 32:52.500]  and began bashing out the expensive windows and saying,
[32:52.500 --> 32:53.820]  why do you need an armored truck?
[32:53.820 --> 32:55.780]  Because I knew this was coming.
[32:55.780 --> 32:58.100]  I said, last year when I got it, there's going to be riots.
[32:58.100 --> 33:02.020]  We're going to need to have these at the RNC and DNC.
[33:02.020 --> 33:03.500]  And no contrary to the media, I did not
[33:03.500 --> 33:06.140]  buy the vehicle for $700,000.
[33:06.140 --> 33:09.820]  I bought it for $245,000.
[33:09.820 --> 33:11.380]  It's been well worth it in the advertising
[33:11.380 --> 33:13.420]  to get the word out and to go to events
[33:13.420 --> 33:16.580]  and take over the media with our message.
[33:16.580 --> 33:19.420]  But I got it for security because we
[33:19.420 --> 33:21.500]  need to be able to go in and show what's happening
[33:21.500 --> 33:24.380]  and not be denied to get into those areas.
[33:24.380 --> 33:26.380]  There's a less expensive armored vehicle
[33:26.380 --> 33:28.620]  that's used that's got almost as much protection.
[33:28.620 --> 33:30.580]  It's about 150,000.
[33:30.580 --> 33:31.940]  It's about 20 years old.
[33:31.940 --> 33:33.700]  But we're looking to get another one right now
[33:33.700 --> 33:35.460]  because we don't have enough for our crew.
[33:35.460 --> 33:37.460]  We're going to be able to get in and get out of these places.
[33:37.460 --> 33:38.220]  It's very dangerous.
[33:38.220 --> 33:39.420]  The police won't help you.
[33:39.420 --> 33:42.700]  It's the lawlessness, the anarchy,
[33:42.700 --> 33:47.860]  that they bring in to destabilize the nation.
[33:47.860 --> 33:50.820]  And it's an exercise of raw power by the mob
[33:50.820 --> 33:53.060]  that the globalists control.
[33:53.060 --> 33:55.900]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night talking
[33:55.900 --> 33:57.580]  about how the mainstream media directs this
[33:57.580 --> 34:01.580]  and calls this peaceful.
[34:01.580 --> 34:04.780]  The press isn't simply covering the riots meanwhile,
[34:04.780 --> 34:06.500]  insisting the riots.
[34:06.500 --> 34:09.620]  At the New York Times, the most recent Pulitzer Prize winner,
[34:09.620 --> 34:12.060]  2020 winner, Nicole Hannah-Jones,
[34:12.060 --> 34:15.100]  said that words you thought you knew the meaning of now
[34:15.100 --> 34:17.060]  have completely different meanings.
[34:17.060 --> 34:20.620]  Violence, for example, when she supports it,
[34:20.620 --> 34:22.860]  isn't really violence.
[34:22.860 --> 34:25.780]  Violence is when an agent of the state
[34:25.780 --> 34:28.820]  kneels on a man's neck until all of the life
[34:28.820 --> 34:31.860]  is leached out of his body.
[34:31.860 --> 34:34.340]  Destroying property which can be replaced
[34:34.340 --> 34:35.900]  is not violence.
[34:35.900 --> 34:39.140]  And to put those things, to use the exact same language,
[34:39.140 --> 34:46.420]  to describe those two things, I think really is not moral.
[34:46.420 --> 34:49.380]  Well, thank you, both of the clown, for telling us that.
[34:49.380 --> 34:51.780]  There are at least 20 police officers
[34:51.780 --> 34:53.500]  dead the last three weeks.
[34:53.500 --> 34:54.580]  No one knows their names.
[34:54.580 --> 34:56.140]  We've said some of their names.
[34:56.140 --> 34:59.540]  Michael Dorn, David Dorn.
[34:59.540 --> 35:02.020]  Another man just got stopped two days ago in Colorado,
[35:02.020 --> 35:03.500]  shot in the head for no reason.
[35:03.500 --> 35:05.700]  The media says he deserves it.
[35:05.700 --> 35:08.820]  The antifa lawyer that did it is proud of it.
[35:08.820 --> 35:13.420]  Smiling and he said, shot him in the head, he's white.
[35:13.420 --> 35:15.100]  By the way, he's on live support.
[35:15.100 --> 35:17.380]  Word is, they may unplug him.
[35:17.380 --> 35:20.220]  But we'll never hear his name.
[35:20.220 --> 35:22.100]  He doesn't have any value because he's white.
[35:22.100 --> 35:24.100]  He deserves to get shot in the head.
[35:24.100 --> 35:25.700]  And then we try to put the statistics out
[35:25.700 --> 35:27.500]  that it's 10 to 1 black on white crime,
[35:27.500 --> 35:29.860]  that the media is encouraging, it's getting worse.
[35:29.860 --> 35:32.700]  Well, it's deleted off Instagram, off YouTube,
[35:32.700 --> 35:34.260]  because it's so credible.
[35:35.780 --> 35:38.500]  And the system can't stand it.
[35:38.500 --> 35:41.780]  So all these nameless people are being killed.
[35:42.740 --> 35:44.540]  It's the left that always wants more police,
[35:44.540 --> 35:46.340]  the left that wants all the thought police.
[35:46.340 --> 35:48.740]  They don't want to get rid of the police.
[35:48.740 --> 35:50.300]  They want to control them.
[35:51.660 --> 35:53.900]  And that's when it becomes a police state.
[35:55.860 --> 35:58.740]  It's the SJWs want in those uniforms.
[35:58.740 --> 36:00.620]  That's why they're having to relax the standards
[36:00.620 --> 36:03.420]  so you can be obese, she can be on drugs.
[36:03.420 --> 36:05.820]  And now you literally have transgendered,
[36:05.820 --> 36:08.420]  bald-headed, pink-haired, buzz-of-the-clown men
[36:09.620 --> 36:11.500]  who are police officers,
[36:11.500 --> 36:13.900]  who are jacked up on so many hormones and so many drugs,
[36:13.900 --> 36:16.220]  they don't know what planet they're on.
[36:16.220 --> 36:18.500]  Because our acquiescence, our going along
[36:18.500 --> 36:20.340]  with all this spoiled rotten behavior,
[36:20.340 --> 36:23.260]  us paying for 30 years for millions of sex changes,
[36:23.260 --> 36:25.900]  us letting pedophiles that access our kids in the schools,
[36:25.900 --> 36:29.100]  the name of diversity, has green-lit all this.
[36:29.100 --> 36:32.580]  So there's a report up at band.video.
[36:32.580 --> 36:34.180]  The article's up on infowars.com.
[36:34.180 --> 36:35.180]  I suggest you share it.
[36:35.180 --> 36:36.420]  It's going viral now.
[36:38.300 --> 36:42.900]  White Supremis attacks hero Antifa in Austin, Texas.
[36:42.900 --> 36:44.100]  Or the alternate headline is,
[36:44.100 --> 36:47.700]  Alex Jones joins Antifa attacks Nazis.
[36:47.700 --> 36:50.100]  This is satire for the media.
[36:50.100 --> 36:51.620]  I'm not gonna eat my neighbors either.
[36:51.620 --> 36:52.780]  This is how Antifa acts.
[36:52.780 --> 36:56.340]  The media says they're heroes when they attack people.
[36:56.340 --> 36:58.940]  So we have our own platform, despite all their attacks.
[36:58.940 --> 37:01.780]  We can still put stuff out and you can still share it.
[37:01.780 --> 37:03.620]  So take action and share the video right now
[37:03.620 --> 37:06.020]  from band.video or infowars.com.
[37:06.020 --> 37:07.180]  Here it is.
[37:07.180 --> 37:08.700]  Look, there's a car right there.
[37:08.700 --> 37:09.660]  It's Hitler.
[37:09.660 --> 37:10.620]  Get him!
[37:10.620 --> 37:11.460]  Get him!
[37:11.460 --> 37:12.300]  Ha!
[37:12.300 --> 37:13.140]  Ha!
[37:13.140 --> 37:13.980]  Ha!
[37:13.980 --> 37:14.820]  Ha!
[37:14.820 --> 37:15.660]  Ha!
[37:15.660 --> 37:16.500]  Ha!
[37:16.500 --> 37:17.340]  Hitler!
[37:17.340 --> 37:19.260]  Get him out of here!
[37:19.260 --> 37:20.100]  Hitler!
[37:20.100 --> 37:21.580]  Come on, get him!
[37:21.580 --> 37:22.420]  Ha!
[37:22.420 --> 37:23.260]  Ha!
[37:23.260 --> 37:24.100]  Ha!
[37:24.100 --> 37:24.940]  Ha!
[37:24.940 --> 37:25.780]  Ha!
[37:25.780 --> 37:26.620]  Ha!
[37:26.620 --> 37:27.460]  Ha!
[37:27.460 --> 37:28.300]  Ha!
[37:28.300 --> 37:29.140]  Ha!
[37:29.140 --> 37:29.980]  Ha!
[37:29.980 --> 37:30.820]  Ha!
[37:30.820 --> 37:31.660]  Ha!
[37:31.660 --> 37:33.020]  You hit me!
[37:33.020 --> 37:33.980]  He hit me!
[37:33.980 --> 37:34.820]  Ha!
[37:34.820 --> 37:35.660]  Ha!
[37:35.660 --> 37:36.500]  Ha!
[37:36.500 --> 37:37.340]  Ha!
[37:37.340 --> 37:38.180]  Ha!
[37:38.180 --> 37:39.020]  Ha!
[37:39.020 --> 37:39.860]  Ha!
[37:39.860 --> 37:40.860]  Get him out of here!
[37:40.860 --> 37:41.700]  Ha!
[37:43.620 --> 37:47.980]  A lot of people told me over the years that I was wrong.
[37:47.980 --> 37:51.260]  They told me Antifa was the way to go.
[37:51.260 --> 37:52.980]  I had to tell you lately I've been watching what's
[37:52.980 --> 37:54.020]  happening out there.
[37:54.020 --> 37:57.140]  The heroes of Antifa are beginning to run over my cars.
[37:57.140 --> 37:59.580]  It's shot and everything else.
[37:59.580 --> 38:01.700]  And so right now, I'm going to tell you
[38:01.700 --> 38:06.580]  I've placed myself on Antifa and George Soros.
[38:06.580 --> 38:08.820]  And those shows are showing Antifa.
[38:08.820 --> 38:11.180]  There's no black people here right now.
[38:11.180 --> 38:14.980]  I want you to bow to me or your racist.
[38:14.980 --> 38:16.140]  That's not enough.
[38:16.140 --> 38:17.820]  Get on your stomachs.
[38:17.820 --> 38:21.140]  I want you to pledge allegiance to George Soros
[38:21.140 --> 38:23.580]  and Hillary Clinton right now.
[38:23.580 --> 38:25.220]  Listen here.
[38:25.220 --> 38:28.460]  So I'm going out there in the street and the road.
[38:28.460 --> 38:31.940]  And the first car we see is a Nazi fascist.
[38:31.940 --> 38:35.020]  If they stop, they're a well-trained Nazi fascist.
[38:35.020 --> 38:37.940]  If they try to grab through us, they're a Nazi fascist.
[38:37.940 --> 38:41.060]  Regardless, we attack.
[38:41.060 --> 38:42.740]  We jump on the hood of the car.
[38:42.740 --> 38:43.620]  And then we're heroes.
[38:43.620 --> 38:45.620]  We call the police like our brother
[38:45.620 --> 38:47.220]  are doing all over the world right now.
[38:47.220 --> 38:48.940]  We're not like thugs or terrorists
[38:48.940 --> 38:50.580]  indistriminately attacking people.
[38:50.580 --> 38:53.020]  No, we're just indistriminately attacking people's cars.
[38:53.020 --> 38:55.500]  Ha!
[38:55.500 --> 38:56.500]  Yeah!
[38:56.500 --> 38:57.500]  Yeah!
[38:57.500 --> 38:58.500]  Yeah!
[38:58.500 --> 38:59.500]  Yeah!
[38:59.500 --> 39:00.500]  Yeah!
[39:00.500 --> 39:01.500]  Yeah!
[39:01.500 --> 39:02.500]  Yeah!
[39:02.500 --> 39:03.500]  Yeah!
[39:03.500 --> 39:04.500]  Yeah!
[39:04.500 --> 39:05.500]  Yeah!
[39:05.500 --> 39:06.500]  Yeah!
[39:06.500 --> 39:07.500]  Yeah!
[39:07.500 --> 39:09.500]  I am an anti-fum all-star.
[39:09.500 --> 39:12.900]  Now, as Jones joins Antifa, let's go out and find
[39:12.900 --> 39:16.020]  the first terrorist we can when we block the road.
[39:16.020 --> 39:17.020]  Death to Nazis!
[39:17.020 --> 39:21.020]  That means anybody we find, leave those survivors out!
[39:21.020 --> 39:23.020]  Yeah!
[39:23.020 --> 39:24.020]  Yeah!
[39:24.020 --> 39:26.020]  Our brethren are shooting people in the head
[39:26.020 --> 39:28.020]  in other areas being called heroes.
[39:28.020 --> 39:29.020]  We're not gonna do that.
[39:29.020 --> 39:31.020]  We're gonna throw ourselves in their vehicles
[39:31.020 --> 39:32.020]  and say they attacked us.
[39:32.020 --> 39:34.020]  Are you ready to be Jesse Spallett?
[39:34.020 --> 39:35.020]  Yeah!
[39:35.020 --> 39:36.020]  Yeah!
[39:36.020 --> 39:37.020]  Look!
[39:37.020 --> 39:38.020]  There's a car right there!
[39:38.020 --> 39:39.020]  It's Hitler!
[39:39.020 --> 39:40.020]  Get him!
[39:40.020 --> 39:41.020]  Get him!
[39:41.020 --> 39:42.020]  Ha!
[39:42.020 --> 39:43.020]  Ha!
[39:43.020 --> 39:44.020]  Ha!
[39:44.020 --> 39:45.020]  Ha!
[39:45.020 --> 39:46.020]  Ha!
[39:46.020 --> 39:47.020]  Ha!
[39:47.020 --> 39:48.020]  Ha!
[39:48.020 --> 39:49.020]  Ha!
[39:49.020 --> 39:50.020]  Ha!
[39:50.020 --> 39:52.020]  The ending conclusion is at man.video.
[39:52.020 --> 39:53.020]  Stay with us.

[41:23.020 --> 41:52.020]  See you next time.
[41:53.020 --> 41:56.020]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense,
[41:56.020 --> 41:58.020]  and it's been sold out for over four months
[41:58.020 --> 42:01.020]  because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[42:01.020 --> 42:04.020]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast,
[42:04.020 --> 42:06.020]  and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense
[42:06.020 --> 42:07.020]  to get it for yourself.
[42:07.020 --> 42:09.020]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[42:09.020 --> 42:11.020]  I looked. In January 2016, I went into a hospital.
[42:11.020 --> 42:13.020]  I went into VA Hospital out here in Boyce,
[42:13.020 --> 42:15.020]  and I was in there until June,
[42:15.020 --> 42:17.020]  and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal
[42:17.020 --> 42:20.020]  was listening to Infowars three hours a day,
[42:20.020 --> 42:23.020]  and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about
[42:23.020 --> 42:25.020]  Living Defense. Let me tell you something, man.
[42:25.020 --> 42:27.020]  I had an internal digestive problem,
[42:27.020 --> 42:30.020]  and I stumbled with it for about five or six years,
[42:30.020 --> 42:32.020]  and the doctors, they tried every step.
[42:32.020 --> 42:34.020]  Nobody could figure out what it is,
[42:34.020 --> 42:36.020]  and then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group
[42:36.020 --> 42:37.020]  and those commercials, I said,
[42:37.020 --> 42:39.020]  you know what, I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[42:39.020 --> 42:41.020]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals
[42:41.020 --> 42:43.020]  because they don't want you to have that stuff,
[42:43.020 --> 42:45.020]  but I ordered it, and it shipped to me.
[42:45.020 --> 42:47.020]  I got it. I hid it from the nurses.
[42:47.020 --> 42:48.020]  I started taking it, man.
[42:48.020 --> 42:50.020]  I have changed my life. It saved my life.
[42:50.020 --> 42:53.020]  Alex Jones and Infowars saved my life.
[42:53.020 --> 42:56.020]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism,
[42:56.020 --> 42:59.020]  and so, populist movements are throwing the globalists
[42:59.020 --> 43:01.020]  out of their countries.
[43:01.020 --> 43:03.020]  That's why the New World Order
[43:03.020 --> 43:05.020]  is instituting race war and division,
[43:05.020 --> 43:08.020]  and telling the people that rebellion is about
[43:08.020 --> 43:10.020]  overthrowing your local police
[43:10.020 --> 43:13.020]  and government and destroying essential services.
[43:13.020 --> 43:17.020]  This is an attempt to have society collapse,
[43:17.020 --> 43:19.020]  and the globalists, as they've done in the third world,
[43:19.020 --> 43:21.020]  will come in and pick up the pieces.
[43:21.020 --> 43:24.020]  They must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank,
[43:24.020 --> 43:28.020]  and the EU openly saying they fund the police.
[43:28.020 --> 43:31.020]  The police have a lot of problems. We all have a lot of problems,
[43:31.020 --> 43:33.020]  but this is our government and our local tabulary,
[43:33.020 --> 43:36.020]  and believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[43:36.020 --> 43:39.020]  they are going to put in a real police state
[43:39.020 --> 43:41.020]  where you have no due process or freedom.
[43:41.020 --> 43:44.020]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world,
[43:44.020 --> 43:46.020]  and they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[43:46.020 --> 43:49.020]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots,
[43:49.020 --> 43:51.020]  and must be opposed.
[43:51.020 --> 43:53.020]  Infowars.com
[43:56.020 --> 43:59.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[43:59.020 --> 44:06.020]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[44:06.020 --> 44:09.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:10.020 --> 44:15.020]  So, big tech now with AI systems is on record saying
[44:15.020 --> 44:18.020]  that they're not going to allow internet access
[44:18.020 --> 44:20.020]  or internet access,
[44:20.020 --> 44:23.020]  but they're not going to allow internet access
[44:23.020 --> 44:25.020]  or internet access,
[44:25.020 --> 44:28.020]  and they're not going to allow internet access
[44:28.020 --> 44:30.020]  or internet access.
[44:30.020 --> 44:33.020]  They're not going to allow any FBI statistics
[44:33.020 --> 44:36.020]  on Google, on Facebook, on Twitter,
[44:36.020 --> 44:39.020]  on Instagram to be shown.
[44:39.020 --> 44:42.020]  It was an article a few days ago about this.
[44:42.020 --> 44:47.020]  On infowars.com, Instagram censors FBI crime stats as hate speech.
[44:47.020 --> 44:49.020]  Well, it just happened.
[44:49.020 --> 44:51.020]  This morning, it went live on YouTube,
[44:51.020 --> 44:53.020]  on his own personal channel, Gregory's,
[44:53.020 --> 44:56.020]  who, again, we hired because it was great camera work.
[44:56.020 --> 44:59.020]  It's a great video exposing FBI stats on black crime.
[44:59.020 --> 45:01.020]  It's posted on Band-Aid video,
[45:01.020 --> 45:04.020]  but why is this so important?
[45:04.020 --> 45:08.020]  Look at the massive increase in censorship happening.
[45:08.020 --> 45:12.020]  No more blacklist and slaves.
[45:12.020 --> 45:16.020]  Microsoft developer rekindles call to make coding
[45:16.020 --> 45:18.020]  politically correct.
[45:18.020 --> 45:22.020]  A blacklist goes back to when you take black marker
[45:22.020 --> 45:25.020]  and you scratch out something.
[45:25.020 --> 45:26.020]  Everybody knows that.
[45:26.020 --> 45:29.020]  When I show an email, somebody sent me all blackout
[45:29.020 --> 45:31.020]  because it's white paper, their name.
[45:31.020 --> 45:35.020]  Whiteout's another way to do it for typewriters
[45:35.020 --> 45:37.020]  because you're going to type over it.
[45:37.020 --> 45:40.020]  It's a thing of function.
[45:40.020 --> 45:43.020]  It's like saying, get rid of your black jacket.
[45:43.020 --> 45:45.020]  It's mean to black people.
[45:45.020 --> 45:48.020]  It's like mentally ill people seeing ghosts in the walls.
[45:48.020 --> 45:51.020]  But the system wants this, so you're not educated, informed,
[45:51.020 --> 45:52.020]  and into knowledge.
[45:52.020 --> 45:55.020]  They want you superstitious and scared of all knowledge.
[45:55.020 --> 45:58.020]  Marion Webster agrees to change definition of racism
[45:58.020 --> 46:00.020]  after a woman complains.
[46:00.020 --> 46:02.020]  She wants to say everything's racism.
[46:02.020 --> 46:03.020]  They say, we agree.
[46:03.020 --> 46:05.020]  It's whatever you say.
[46:05.020 --> 46:06.020]  So first they get the West.
[46:06.020 --> 46:08.020]  It first stood up against what you'd call racism.
[46:08.020 --> 46:11.020]  Christianity did that.
[46:11.020 --> 46:13.020]  Just say we don't want racism,
[46:13.020 --> 46:15.020]  and now they can define whatever they want as racism
[46:15.020 --> 46:18.020]  and white it out, black it out, erase it, pull it down,
[46:18.020 --> 46:20.020]  memory hold it.
[46:20.020 --> 46:23.020]  Blogging platform bams writer for listing corporations
[46:23.020 --> 46:25.020]  that be funded writers.
[46:25.020 --> 46:28.020]  That funded writers.
[46:28.020 --> 46:30.020]  That defended writers.
[46:30.020 --> 46:33.020]  So blogging platform bams writer for listing corporations
[46:33.020 --> 46:38.020]  that defended writers and funded writers.
[46:38.020 --> 46:41.020]  And medium said, you're not allowed to show who's pushing
[46:41.020 --> 46:45.020]  Black Lives Matter or who's pushing antifa or gun control.
[46:45.020 --> 46:46.020]  No, no, no.
[46:46.020 --> 46:48.020]  They call that targeted harassment because they're really all
[46:48.020 --> 46:52.020]  bullying us, harassing us, controlling us, surveilling us.
[46:52.020 --> 46:55.020]  And when we just say, hey, here's who's oppressing us.
[46:55.020 --> 46:57.020]  Oh, no, you can't do that.
[46:57.020 --> 47:01.020]  HBO removes Gone with the Wind, a racing first black woman
[47:01.020 --> 47:04.020]  to win an Oscar.
[47:04.020 --> 47:06.020]  They're going to re-release it with subtitles saying how it's bad
[47:06.020 --> 47:10.020]  and how it's evil because, oh, after the Civil War,
[47:10.020 --> 47:14.020]  the black woman stays there with the people at the plantation.
[47:14.020 --> 47:15.020]  Doesn't matter.
[47:15.020 --> 47:17.020]  That's historically true 90% of the time.
[47:17.020 --> 47:22.020]  It's a way to take over all art, control all art, dominate all art
[47:22.020 --> 47:25.020]  just like the old Soviet Union and Nazi Germany did it.
[47:25.020 --> 47:28.020]  London counselor, member of the city council,
[47:28.020 --> 47:33.020]  petitions to remove Churchill mural.
[47:33.020 --> 47:38.020]  So this is what it's all about is total power over the human mind.
[47:38.020 --> 47:39.020]  And Greg Reese is here.
[47:39.020 --> 47:42.020]  We're going to play this report on a bunch of TV and radio stations
[47:42.020 --> 47:44.020]  and hopefully you'll share it up and on video.
[47:44.020 --> 47:47.020]  But look at where we are, little OACs, little islands
[47:47.020 --> 47:50.020]  that are so allowed to function and tell the truth.
[47:50.020 --> 47:52.020]  And once we're taken off air, they hope,
[47:52.020 --> 47:57.020]  then they can steal our identities and say in our names whatever they want, Greg.
[47:57.020 --> 47:59.020]  It's happening so quickly right now.
[47:59.020 --> 48:03.020]  And what I'm noticing is this split is now becoming more pure on both sides.
[48:03.020 --> 48:07.020]  One side wants the truth and is just looking for truth.
[48:07.020 --> 48:09.020]  And what we're seeing with the other side at this point,
[48:09.020 --> 48:12.020]  because it's so blatant, is what I'm seeing at least,
[48:12.020 --> 48:15.020]  people are revealing that they don't really care about the truth.
[48:15.020 --> 48:18.020]  They're revealing that all that has just been talk.
[48:18.020 --> 48:20.020]  How many Democrats have said,
[48:20.020 --> 48:23.020]  I don't care if he cooks children, I don't care if he rapes women,
[48:23.020 --> 48:24.020]  I want Joe Biden.
[48:24.020 --> 48:25.020]  Right.
[48:25.020 --> 48:28.020]  And this I'm seeing now all the way down to our level.
[48:28.020 --> 48:30.020]  I mean, we've seen it at the level of the elites
[48:30.020 --> 48:34.020]  and I'm starting to see it, well, on Facebook at least with some old friends
[48:34.020 --> 48:37.020]  that seem to be echoing the same sentiment of like,
[48:37.020 --> 48:40.020]  all they care about is their own personal rage and anger.
[48:40.020 --> 48:42.020]  Yeah, their followers, they're mad at the system
[48:42.020 --> 48:46.020]  and then they're following directives of the core of the establishment.
[48:46.020 --> 48:48.020]  They claim their anti-establishment,
[48:48.020 --> 48:51.020]  but leftists are the most establishment lap dogs ever.
[48:51.020 --> 48:54.020]  And like every multinational corporation is backing them up.
[48:54.020 --> 48:58.020]  So I mean, how do they possibly think they are in some type of revolution?
[48:58.020 --> 48:59.020]  Exactly.
[48:59.020 --> 49:02.020]  In a military sense, they have a thousand tanks, a thousand planes,
[49:02.020 --> 49:05.020]  a million troops, and we've got a peace shoe.
[49:05.020 --> 49:08.020]  And they're like, you're the establishment, we're going to get you.
[49:08.020 --> 49:13.020]  And it's like, whoa, watching these followers line up to do this is frightening for them.
[49:13.020 --> 49:17.020]  And I've even heard people that I used to think were reasonable,
[49:17.020 --> 49:20.020]  basically try to, it convinced me that this is good.
[49:20.020 --> 49:23.020]  The only price you have to pay is you have to go against Whitey.
[49:23.020 --> 49:26.020]  But other than that, the whole world can get in on this
[49:26.020 --> 49:30.020]  and it's a world revolution so long as you denounce Whitey,
[49:30.020 --> 49:34.020]  which is insane, but I've heard people try to sell this to me as if that's...
[49:34.020 --> 49:35.020]  But it's mainly White people.
[49:35.020 --> 49:36.020]  Yeah.
[49:36.020 --> 49:40.020]  This is a Marxist-Leninist class war by the ultra-rich trying to destroy their only competition,
[49:40.020 --> 49:42.020]  the latter out of poverty, the middle class.
[49:42.020 --> 49:45.020]  They're killing the American system right now in front of us.
[49:45.020 --> 49:48.020]  It's all about a lockdown, a straight jacket, a mask over our mouths,
[49:48.020 --> 49:51.020]  bowing, it's all cult programming.
[49:51.020 --> 49:54.020]  And now the left goes, damn right, we're censoring you.
[49:54.020 --> 49:55.020]  Damn right, we want...
[49:55.020 --> 49:58.020]  The ADL said just a few months ago, we want Alex Jones' band
[49:58.020 --> 50:01.020]  and we want people that don't do what we say at Big Tech arrested
[50:01.020 --> 50:04.020]  and we, the ADL, will decide what can be seen.
[50:04.020 --> 50:09.020]  You must go through us first as a filter, the biggest power grab in human history.
[50:09.020 --> 50:10.020]  Absolutely.
[50:10.020 --> 50:15.020]  You know, after the whole fiasco with the homeless gentlemen in Austin, Texas,
[50:15.020 --> 50:20.020]  with the riots, I started getting a lot more lefties attacking me on Twitter
[50:20.020 --> 50:23.020]  and so I engaged a little bit and I followed one of them
[50:23.020 --> 50:28.020]  and right in his bio, it said, I want off of this rock
[50:28.020 --> 50:30.020]  and it was a bit more harsh than that.
[50:30.020 --> 50:34.020]  And I mean, that just kind of, and I challenged him on that and he doubled down on it.
[50:34.020 --> 50:37.020]  So basically these are people that are just miserable, they hate their lives,
[50:37.020 --> 50:41.020]  they want it to end and they just want to bring the whole thing down with them.
[50:41.020 --> 50:44.020]  That's right, let's go to your report that can only be seen here
[50:44.020 --> 50:46.020]  and only spread by you, Paul Reverez.
[50:46.020 --> 50:50.020]  Here is, Black Lives Matter is a new world order globalist Trojan horse.
[50:52.020 --> 50:54.020]  Black Lives Matter is a lie.
[50:54.020 --> 50:58.020]  There is no genocide of young innocent black men.
[50:58.020 --> 51:04.020]  In 2019, there were only 10 cases in which unarmed African Americans
[51:04.020 --> 51:07.020]  were fatally shot by the police.
[51:07.020 --> 51:12.020]  In five out of 10 cases, an officer was attacked just before the shooting
[51:12.020 --> 51:17.020]  and in two of the remaining four, the officer was criminally charged.
[51:17.020 --> 51:20.020]  Where is the injustice?
[51:20.020 --> 51:25.020]  Also in 2019, there were 25 unarmed white Americans
[51:25.020 --> 51:29.020]  who were fatally shot by the police.
[51:29.020 --> 51:31.020]  According to FBI statistics,
[51:31.020 --> 51:34.020]  I tell you what, I went to this 15 seconds late,
[51:34.020 --> 51:37.020]  so when we come back at six after next hour, Greg, you stay with me.
[51:37.020 --> 51:39.020]  We're going to play this report there.
[51:39.020 --> 51:42.020]  And again, this is an exercise in resistance.
[51:42.020 --> 51:47.020]  Total AI surveillance control over all the major platforms is here.
[51:47.020 --> 51:49.020]  They're coming out with global IDs,
[51:49.020 --> 51:51.020]  tested in China to track everywhere you go.
[51:51.020 --> 51:54.020]  If you're not a good globalist, they're saying they're going to defund you.
[51:54.020 --> 51:56.020]  They're going to block you from commerce.
[51:56.020 --> 51:58.020]  People say, well, I better go along with it.
[51:58.020 --> 52:00.020]  No, you better resist it.
[52:00.020 --> 52:03.020]  Don't act like the French when the Germans invaded in World War II, folks.
[52:03.020 --> 52:07.020]  It's only going to get worse for you the longer you grovel and give in.
[52:07.020 --> 52:09.020]  These are post-human exterminists.
[52:09.020 --> 52:11.020]  These are globalists that believe we're a weak species.
[52:11.020 --> 52:13.020]  They believe they're supermen,
[52:13.020 --> 52:17.020]  and they believe they're making their move to power grab the whole future.
[52:17.020 --> 52:19.020]  And the fact that you act, well, yes,
[52:19.020 --> 52:24.020]  they believe that a social Darwin level gives them the right and the deed to do it.
[52:24.020 --> 52:25.020]  Yeah.
[52:25.020 --> 52:27.020]  You know, the system we have isn't perfect.
[52:27.020 --> 52:28.020]  No one says it is.
[52:28.020 --> 52:32.020]  But at this point, our system is like a lifeboat in an emergency.
[52:32.020 --> 52:36.020]  The system coming in overwrites everything.
[52:36.020 --> 52:39.020]  And it's using the spoiled bratness of our system.
[52:39.020 --> 52:42.020]  And I'll open and free it as compared to what you're about to get.
[52:42.020 --> 52:44.020]  And it's true, though.
[52:44.020 --> 52:45.020]  It's a paradox.
[52:45.020 --> 52:48.020]  This much freedom, on average, made us decadent, slob-like, and weak.
[52:48.020 --> 52:50.020]  But now apex predators like Bill Gates come in,
[52:50.020 --> 52:54.020]  and it's just crazy to watch the weakest people all piled up and ready
[52:54.020 --> 52:58.020]  to attack anybody that's got a car nicer than theirs,
[52:58.020 --> 53:02.020]  or who's white, led by weird, crazy, mentally ill white people.
[53:02.020 --> 53:03.020]  I mean, it's just insane.
[53:03.020 --> 53:09.020]  It's like no dystopic novel, no science fiction movie could describe something this freakish.
[53:09.020 --> 53:10.020]  No, absolutely not.
[53:10.020 --> 53:11.020]  And it's only going to get more freakish.
[53:11.020 --> 53:13.020]  I think it needs to get more freakish.
[53:13.020 --> 53:15.020]  A lot of people have been around the office,
[53:15.020 --> 53:18.020]  have been talking, there's a concern that Trump has enacted and done anything.
[53:18.020 --> 53:22.020]  But I'm starting to think that if we want to actually clean things up to the level
[53:22.020 --> 53:27.020]  that we want to clean them up, then people need to wake up out of this luxuriant laziness.
[53:27.020 --> 53:28.020]  But see, that's the ignorance.
[53:28.020 --> 53:29.020]  But see, there's the paradox.
[53:29.020 --> 53:32.020]  The left thinks collapse it, and we'll wake up out of the nightmare,
[53:32.020 --> 53:33.020]  except they are the nightmare.
[53:33.020 --> 53:34.020]  Right.
[53:34.020 --> 53:37.020]  So they want us to wake up out of our dream to the nightmare that's them.
[53:37.020 --> 53:40.020]  When we wake up, it's bye-bye to them, not us.
[53:40.020 --> 53:43.020]  You think you're safe and your armored fortress is globalist?
[53:43.020 --> 53:46.020]  Think again, scumbag!
[53:46.020 --> 53:47.020]  And then there's your...
[53:47.020 --> 53:48.020]  See the paradox, though?
[53:48.020 --> 53:49.020]  Yes, absolutely.
[53:49.020 --> 53:52.020]  And then someone pointed out, I believe it was Harrison Smith this morning, pointed out
[53:52.020 --> 53:57.020]  that if people didn't wake up during these riots when cities were burning down,
[53:57.020 --> 54:01.020]  if people just stayed home then, what makes anyone think that there's going to be some kind of...
[54:01.020 --> 54:02.020]  Oh, that was the other point.
[54:02.020 --> 54:05.020]  I was talking to a police officer friend of mine this morning,
[54:05.020 --> 54:10.020]  and he was arguing with other APD officers on Facebook about our video.
[54:10.020 --> 54:13.020]  He was arguing, oh, nobody got hurt in Austin.
[54:13.020 --> 54:15.020]  Jones is making stuff up where I did the joke where I'm anti-fun.
[54:15.020 --> 54:16.020]  I'm attacking this person.
[54:16.020 --> 54:19.020]  What do you mean we caught it on tape multiple times?
[54:19.020 --> 54:21.020]  Blocking roads, beating up white people.
[54:21.020 --> 54:23.020]  Our cameras caught it multiple times.
[54:23.020 --> 54:25.020]  What the hell are you talking about?
[54:25.020 --> 54:26.020]  Yeah.
[54:26.020 --> 54:27.020]  Things have gone...
[54:27.020 --> 54:30.020]  A lot of the Austin cops, folks, love it, because they're followers,
[54:30.020 --> 54:32.020]  and so they're getting into hating themselves.
[54:32.020 --> 54:35.020]  It's called Stock Home Syndrome.
[54:35.020 --> 54:37.020]  Stock Home Syndrome.
[54:37.020 --> 54:38.020]  Gregory, stay there.
[54:38.020 --> 54:39.020]  We're going to come back.
[54:39.020 --> 54:40.020]  We're going to be more important and more commentary
[54:40.020 --> 55:09.020]  than we got a big coup against Trump news coming up.
[55:10.020 --> 55:14.020]  Again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine,
[55:14.020 --> 55:16.020]  not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[55:16.020 --> 55:17.020]  We're really excited about it.
[55:17.020 --> 55:19.020]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[55:19.020 --> 55:23.020]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle
[55:23.020 --> 55:25.020]  that had us talk to the scientists and developers
[55:25.020 --> 55:28.020]  and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body
[55:28.020 --> 55:31.020]  in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[55:31.020 --> 55:34.020]  Get your survival shield X2 nascent iodine spray now
[55:34.020 --> 55:37.020]  at 33% off at infowarstore.com
[55:37.020 --> 55:44.020]  and experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[55:44.020 --> 55:48.020]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media
[55:48.020 --> 55:53.020]  and the Chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[55:53.020 --> 55:56.020]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression
[55:56.020 --> 55:58.020]  and the death sentence for the third world.
[55:58.020 --> 56:02.020]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persist,
[56:02.020 --> 56:04.020]  the worse it's going to be.
[56:04.020 --> 56:08.020]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth
[56:08.020 --> 56:10.020]  that's been built up in a complex economy.
[56:10.020 --> 56:11.020]  That's what we've always said.
[56:11.020 --> 56:14.020]  It's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[56:14.020 --> 56:17.020]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent
[56:17.020 --> 56:19.020]  so that we're under their control.
[56:19.020 --> 56:21.020]  They've admitted all of this.
[56:21.020 --> 56:27.020]  So remember, how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases
[56:27.020 --> 56:29.020]  to be able to predict things before they happen
[56:29.020 --> 56:33.020]  because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan
[56:33.020 --> 56:36.020]  and yes, it's dystopic and yes, it's scary.
[56:36.020 --> 56:40.020]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[56:40.020 --> 57:04.020]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[57:10.020 --> 57:15.020]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:15.020 --> 57:20.020]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, June 10th,
[57:20.020 --> 57:23.020]  2020 transmission with 145 days left
[57:23.020 --> 57:24.020]  until the election.
[57:24.020 --> 57:26.020]  Greg recently with me next segment
[57:26.020 --> 57:30.020]  and then Richard Reeves going to be in studio with really frightening information
[57:30.020 --> 57:36.020]  but knowing it's half the battle, that's coming up bottom of the hour today.
[57:36.020 --> 57:40.020]  We're going to continue to look at all the censorship of FBI crime statistics
[57:40.020 --> 57:43.020]  about who's really targeting black people, who's really targeting white people.
[57:43.020 --> 57:46.020]  We'll look at all that censored information with Greg Reeves
[57:46.020 --> 57:51.020]  and play his report that's been censored by YouTube coming up on the other side.
[57:51.020 --> 57:55.020]  Now, the big, huge mega sale, the biggest sale of 2020 so far,
[57:55.020 --> 57:58.020]  we'll probably have some similar deals around Christmas, is gone.
[57:58.020 --> 58:00.020]  We ran it for two weeks.
[58:00.020 --> 58:04.020]  We sold out of our 60 top items or so, more than half of them.
[58:04.020 --> 58:06.020]  All of the other products aren't coming in for a few months.
[58:06.020 --> 58:08.020]  We've still got a lot of the great products there
[58:08.020 --> 58:13.020]  and I've decided to on some of the top selling products that we still have in stock
[58:13.020 --> 58:17.020]  to have them continue at 60% off until they sell out,
[58:17.020 --> 58:20.020]  like X2, like X3, like a real red pill.
[58:20.020 --> 58:23.020]  We're talking about a thousand bottles or so of each one of these.
[58:23.020 --> 58:26.020]  So this will probably run for a week
[58:26.020 --> 58:28.020]  and then those are going to be gone for a few months
[58:28.020 --> 58:30.020]  but we've got some other exciting announcements.
[58:30.020 --> 58:34.020]  It's finally here, introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray,
[58:34.020 --> 58:39.020]  available for 33% off 1995, intro pricing.
[58:39.020 --> 58:44.020]  And this has got a great proprietary system that it's in, how it gets delivered.
[58:44.020 --> 58:46.020]  It's different than X2.
[58:46.020 --> 58:50.020]  It's the Deep Earth Crystals but a different Constitution,
[58:50.020 --> 58:56.020]  the way it mixes with the delivery product that's with it.
[58:56.020 --> 59:02.020]  I'm really, really proud of Survival Shield X2.
[59:02.020 --> 59:05.020]  Spray and infowarstore.com.
[59:05.020 --> 59:12.020]  It's now here and the reason I like it is you're able to carry it with you on the road.
[59:12.020 --> 59:14.020]  The droppers are great under the tongue.
[59:14.020 --> 59:18.020]  That's the best place to take it but then it can get messy.
[59:18.020 --> 59:20.020]  It's not good with kids.
[59:20.020 --> 59:23.020]  This is a smaller bottle.
[59:23.020 --> 59:26.020]  It's the same amount in the bottle but it's a little bit more snug.
[59:26.020 --> 59:29.020]  It's got a little snug nose spray bottle and it goes easier in your pocket.
[59:29.020 --> 59:32.020]  It stays in your truck, stays in your van, stays in your car.
[59:32.020 --> 59:34.020]  It's great in your office drawer.
[59:34.020 --> 59:35.020]  It's just a great delivery system.
[59:35.020 --> 59:37.020]  It's a new way to get X2.
[59:37.020 --> 59:40.020]  And again, the solution it's in is different.
[59:40.020 --> 59:43.020]  The scientists explained to me this aridine system,
[59:43.020 --> 59:46.020]  the way it aerosolizes and the way the molecules form with the iodine
[59:46.020 --> 59:48.020]  and the way it gets delivered different.
[59:48.020 --> 59:50.020]  Just trust me, it's good.
[59:50.020 --> 59:51.020]  We're proud of it.
[59:51.020 --> 59:56.020]  And my biggest problem is I tend to forget to take my X2.
[59:56.020 --> 59:58.020]  And it's something that is essential.
[59:58.020 --> 1:00:00.020]  It's something that changes the entire body chemistry.
[1:00:00.020 --> 1:00:03.020]  It's something that is so good for your thyroid, all your glands,
[1:00:03.020 --> 1:00:07.020]  your blood, your bones, your eyes, your brain, libido, everything.
[1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:10.020]  And so for me, it's a better way to take it with me on the road
[1:00:10.020 --> 1:00:12.020]  and another way for me to remember to take it.
[1:00:12.020 --> 1:00:15.020]  And it also aerosolizes into the back of the throat and into the palate
[1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:17.020]  instead of just going under the tongue.
[1:00:17.020 --> 1:00:19.020]  So it's a different way to take it.
[1:00:19.020 --> 1:00:22.020]  It's better in some ways better, not as good in other ways.
[1:00:22.020 --> 1:00:23.020]  It's apples and oranges.
[1:00:23.020 --> 1:00:27.020]  So get your survival shield X2 spray at infowarstore.com today.
[1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:30.020]  Also, they're attacking us on cyberspace.
[1:00:30.020 --> 1:00:34.020]  Their communist forces are trying to intimidate us in the third dimension.
[1:00:34.020 --> 1:00:37.020]  We're kicking their butt with numbers and with information
[1:00:37.020 --> 1:00:41.020]  and with intellectual arguments when they attack us physically as well.
[1:00:41.020 --> 1:00:44.020]  But we have $9.95.
[1:00:44.020 --> 1:00:46.020]  That is on average at cost.
[1:00:46.020 --> 1:00:47.020]  Some shirts cost us $14.
[1:00:47.020 --> 1:00:50.020]  Some shirts cost us $5 apiece, depending on the quality.
[1:00:50.020 --> 1:00:53.020]  Whether it's a designer's super luxurious shirt
[1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:56.020]  or just an average t-shirt, we've got all different types.
[1:00:56.020 --> 1:00:59.020]  Made in America, made in Venezuela, made in Mexico, made wherever.
[1:00:59.020 --> 1:01:01.020]  We've got a made all over Latin America.
[1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:02.020]  Some people want a really cheap shirt.
[1:01:02.020 --> 1:01:03.020]  We've got those.
[1:01:03.020 --> 1:01:05.020]  We have the expensive Made in America shirts.
[1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:08.020]  The point is, is that they're all $9.95.
[1:01:08.020 --> 1:01:13.020]  That averages out to the average cost of the t-shirts.
[1:01:13.020 --> 1:01:16.020]  That way you can get them for the campaign,
[1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:18.020]  get them for what's happening in the world.
[1:01:18.020 --> 1:01:20.020]  Whether it's an out in the open Info War shirt
[1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:22.020]  or whether it's just a don't tread on me shirt
[1:01:22.020 --> 1:01:25.020]  or whether it's a 5G shirt or whether it's a Space Force shirt.
[1:01:25.020 --> 1:01:26.020]  It's all there.
[1:01:26.020 --> 1:01:27.020]  Choose your own adventure.
[1:01:27.020 --> 1:01:28.020]  Meet like-minded people.
[1:01:28.020 --> 1:01:29.020]  Support the Info War.
[1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:31.020]  But I want to get all these t-shirts out there.
[1:01:31.020 --> 1:01:33.020]  We haven't done this since the last time.
[1:01:33.020 --> 1:01:36.020]  There was a campaign going for a general election four years ago.
[1:01:36.020 --> 1:01:37.020]  We're doing it again.
[1:01:37.020 --> 1:01:40.020]  All shirts at costinfowarstore.com
[1:01:40.020 --> 1:01:43.020]  or AAA-2533139.
[1:01:43.020 --> 1:01:46.020]  All right, stay with us, Greg Rees and the censored video
[1:01:46.020 --> 1:01:48.020]  with FBI crime statistics of Black Lives Matter
[1:01:48.020 --> 1:01:49.020]  straight ahead.
[1:01:53.020 --> 1:01:56.020]  We're living in insanely dangerous times
[1:01:56.020 --> 1:01:58.020]  and I told folks going back three months ago,
[1:01:58.020 --> 1:02:00.020]  I'm not buying horrible food
[1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:02.020]  because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[1:02:02.020 --> 1:02:03.020]  I'm worried about the food shortages
[1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:05.020]  and the economic collapse.
[1:02:05.020 --> 1:02:07.020]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun
[1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:09.020]  that's already caused food shortages
[1:02:09.020 --> 1:02:11.020]  and the collapse of farms and ranches
[1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:13.020]  across the United States and it's even worse
[1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:14.020]  in the Third World.
[1:02:14.020 --> 1:02:15.020]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives,
[1:02:15.020 --> 1:02:17.020]  can clean this up and fix it.
[1:02:17.020 --> 1:02:19.020]  But with the election fraud and the COVID-19,
[1:02:19.020 --> 1:02:21.020]  all the wars and the Third World collapsing
[1:02:21.020 --> 1:02:23.020]  and everything else is going on,
[1:02:23.020 --> 1:02:25.020]  now is the time to get storeable foods
[1:02:25.020 --> 1:02:27.020]  because they'll last for 25 years.
[1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:29.020]  They're in easily totable bags.
[1:02:29.020 --> 1:02:31.020]  It's high quality food and it's good to have
[1:02:31.020 --> 1:02:33.020]  that box checked off to be ready.
[1:02:33.020 --> 1:02:34.020]  And it funds the Info War.
[1:02:34.020 --> 1:02:36.020]  So we have storeable food available again.
[1:02:36.020 --> 1:02:40.020]  InfoWarstore.com or call toll-free, AAA-2533139

[1:02:42.020 --> 1:02:44.020]  because the globalists want you dependent on them.
[1:02:44.020 --> 1:02:46.020]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.

[1:03:38.020 --> 1:03:40.020]  Hope from Winfrey,
[1:03:40.020 --> 1:03:42.020]  who hangs out secretly with the Clintons
[1:03:42.020 --> 1:03:44.020]  and Bill Gates with Jeffrey Epstein,
[1:03:44.020 --> 1:03:46.020]  Warren Buffett, Ted Turner and others,
[1:03:46.020 --> 1:03:49.020]  running their secret world government
[1:03:49.020 --> 1:03:51.020]  depopulation organization,
[1:03:51.020 --> 1:03:53.020]  has come out and said she's leading
[1:03:53.020 --> 1:03:55.020]  the ransom note for America.
[1:03:55.020 --> 1:03:58.020]  The media will endorse the burning of the cities,
[1:03:58.020 --> 1:04:00.020]  the murder of police,
[1:04:00.020 --> 1:04:03.020]  if you do not follow her list of demands.
[1:04:03.020 --> 1:04:06.020]  It's a Jamie White article on infowars.com.
[1:04:06.020 --> 1:04:08.020]  Oprah leads BLM Ransom Summit
[1:04:08.020 --> 1:04:10.020]  with list of demands for America,
[1:04:10.020 --> 1:04:12.020]  joined by far-left Democrats
[1:04:12.020 --> 1:04:14.020]  like Stacy Abrams,
[1:04:14.020 --> 1:04:16.020]  Atlanta Mayor
[1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:18.020]  and others.
[1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:20.020]  Oprah is leading a two-day televised
[1:04:20.020 --> 1:04:22.020]  racial summit
[1:04:22.020 --> 1:04:24.020]  on behalf of Black Lives Matter to lay out
[1:04:24.020 --> 1:04:26.020]  the racial organization's list of demands,
[1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:28.020]  which is, by the way,
[1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:30.020]  don't have a traditional family, kill black babies.
[1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:32.020]  Seriously, look it up.
[1:04:32.020 --> 1:04:34.020]  Demands moving forward following almost two weeks
[1:04:34.020 --> 1:04:37.020]  of nationwide rioting over George Floyd's death.
[1:04:37.020 --> 1:04:39.020]  Absolutely incredible.
[1:04:39.020 --> 1:04:41.020]  It's up on infowars.com.
[1:04:41.020 --> 1:04:43.020]  Learn the rest of the story,

[1:04:45.020 --> 1:04:47.020]  until they probably change it.
[1:04:47.020 --> 1:04:50.020]  Billionaires meet in secret to stop over population.
[1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:52.020]  And you'll get Wall Street Journal,
[1:04:52.020 --> 1:04:54.020]  New York Times, all of them
[1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:56.020]  15 years ago, 12 years ago,
[1:04:56.020 --> 1:04:58.020]  that Oprah's part of a group to set up
[1:04:58.020 --> 1:05:00.020]  world government to reduce the population
[1:05:00.020 --> 1:05:02.020]  of Africa.
[1:05:02.020 --> 1:05:04.020]  You can also pull up
[1:05:04.020 --> 1:05:06.020]  the London Guardian saying that's their goal.
[1:05:06.020 --> 1:05:08.020]  We'll show you that here in just a moment.
[1:05:08.020 --> 1:05:10.020]  But, Greg Ries,
[1:05:10.020 --> 1:05:12.020]  your piece
[1:05:12.020 --> 1:05:14.020]  taking off YouTube for thought crime
[1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:16.020]  and all you're showing is FBI statistics
[1:05:16.020 --> 1:05:18.020]  about what's really killing black people.
[1:05:18.020 --> 1:05:20.020]  Yeah, and you know, I remember growing up,
[1:05:20.020 --> 1:05:22.020]  it was always kind of known,
[1:05:22.020 --> 1:05:24.020]  these numbers were always kind of known.
[1:05:24.020 --> 1:05:26.020]  I grew up in a
[1:05:26.020 --> 1:05:28.020]  in a very liberal
[1:05:28.020 --> 1:05:30.020]  town in Cleveland, Cleveland Heights.
[1:05:30.020 --> 1:05:32.020]  There was a very large black population there.
[1:05:32.020 --> 1:05:34.020]  There was a lot of, it was a very
[1:05:34.020 --> 1:05:36.020]  integrated neighborhood,
[1:05:36.020 --> 1:05:38.020]  or I think that's the integrated neighborhood,
[1:05:38.020 --> 1:05:40.020]  I guess you could say, and
[1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:42.020]  these numbers were always kind of known,
[1:05:42.020 --> 1:05:44.020]  but it was just sort of like unspoken
[1:05:44.020 --> 1:05:46.020]  because it was sort of understood that it was
[1:05:46.020 --> 1:05:48.020]  social, economic, it was
[1:05:48.020 --> 1:05:50.020]  because of all these issues and problems
[1:05:50.020 --> 1:05:52.020]  growing up in the ghetto and stuff like that.
[1:05:52.020 --> 1:05:54.020]  Having a rough time,
[1:05:54.020 --> 1:05:56.020]  that's how it was felt.
[1:05:56.020 --> 1:05:58.020]  But now, when it's being used
[1:05:58.020 --> 1:06:00.020]  so blatantly,
[1:06:00.020 --> 1:06:02.020]  best case scenario, it's
[1:06:02.020 --> 1:06:04.020]  sinister almost. I mean,
[1:06:04.020 --> 1:06:06.020]  the way it's being used
[1:06:06.020 --> 1:06:08.020]  and the way that
[1:06:08.020 --> 1:06:10.020]  it seems, it's being completely
[1:06:10.020 --> 1:06:12.020]  socially acceptable
[1:06:12.020 --> 1:06:14.020]  when together and unite
[1:06:14.020 --> 1:06:16.020]  against whitey. It's just crazy.
[1:06:16.020 --> 1:06:18.020]  And it's working on a lot of people.
[1:06:18.020 --> 1:06:20.020]  And
[1:06:20.020 --> 1:06:22.020]  again, if anyone just wants to do this,
[1:06:22.020 --> 1:06:24.020]  there's literally London Guardian, AP
[1:06:24.020 --> 1:06:26.020]  Reuters, New York Times, Wall Street Journal,
[1:06:26.020 --> 1:06:28.020]  billionaires meeting the secret
[1:06:28.020 --> 1:06:30.020]  to discuss depopulation.
[1:06:30.020 --> 1:06:32.020]  And you'll get Oprah Winfrey
[1:06:32.020 --> 1:06:34.020]  at the secret meetings with Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:06:34.020 --> 1:06:36.020]  Okay?
[1:06:36.020 --> 1:06:38.020]  So, she wants to kill black people.
[1:06:38.020 --> 1:06:40.020]  She admits that's her plan.
[1:06:40.020 --> 1:06:42.020]  So, of course, she's the face of Planned Parenthood,
[1:06:42.020 --> 1:06:44.020]  the real Nazis, the eugenicists that are now using
[1:06:44.020 --> 1:06:46.020]  the death of black people to push their total
[1:06:46.020 --> 1:06:48.020]  takeover agenda. These are the same people
[1:06:48.020 --> 1:06:50.020]  that run the COVID-19 response that put
[1:06:50.020 --> 1:06:52.020]  people with pneumonia and the flu
[1:06:52.020 --> 1:06:54.020]  in hospitals and
[1:06:54.020 --> 1:06:56.020]  in nursing homes to get a higher death rate.
[1:06:56.020 --> 1:06:58.020]  These are monster Nazis.
[1:06:58.020 --> 1:07:00.020]  Well, I remember
[1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:02.020]  after COVID, before the riots,
[1:07:02.020 --> 1:07:04.020]  I remember thinking, you'll know when things are about
[1:07:04.020 --> 1:07:06.020]  to get really hairy when a lot of these powerful
[1:07:06.020 --> 1:07:08.020]  people start disappearing from the
[1:07:08.020 --> 1:07:10.020]  surface, from the public view.
[1:07:10.020 --> 1:07:12.020]  And I don't know if that's what's happening in the riots or not,
[1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:14.020]  but it certainly seems like
[1:07:14.020 --> 1:07:16.020]  all of this is just
[1:07:16.020 --> 1:07:18.020]  heavy, heavy distractions keeping everyone
[1:07:18.020 --> 1:07:20.020]  completely disorientated
[1:07:20.020 --> 1:07:22.020]  disorientated in chaos
[1:07:22.020 --> 1:07:24.020]  while other plans are being
[1:07:24.020 --> 1:07:26.020]  rolled out.
[1:07:26.020 --> 1:07:28.020]  The Guardian, the headline is, they're called
[1:07:28.020 --> 1:07:30.020]  the club to save the world
[1:07:30.020 --> 1:07:32.020]  and help present it to depopulate.
[1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:34.020]  And the other headline is, Bill Gates is worried
[1:07:34.020 --> 1:07:36.020]  about African overpopulation
[1:07:36.020 --> 1:07:38.020]  wants to help them depopulate.
[1:07:38.020 --> 1:07:40.020]  So depopulating the black people's good
[1:07:40.020 --> 1:07:42.020]  according to the liberals,
[1:07:42.020 --> 1:07:44.020]  but then the black people are all supposed to cry
[1:07:44.020 --> 1:07:46.020]  for George Floyd when the globalists ring
[1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:48.020]  the bell and tell them what to do.
[1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:50.020]  Well, Alex, if it's called the good club,
[1:07:50.020 --> 1:07:52.020]  then doesn't that mean
[1:07:52.020 --> 1:07:54.020]  if you oppose it, then you're bad?
[1:07:54.020 --> 1:07:58.020]  That's right, we're in the bad club.
[1:07:58.020 --> 1:08:00.020]  And that works.
[1:08:00.020 --> 1:08:02.020]  That's Black Lives Matter.
[1:08:02.020 --> 1:08:04.020]  Well, we're going to play the report right now
[1:08:04.020 --> 1:08:06.020]  that, again,
[1:08:06.020 --> 1:08:08.020]  YouTube has taken down saying you violated
[1:08:08.020 --> 1:08:10.020]  community guidelines. We have the screenshots of that
[1:08:10.020 --> 1:08:12.020]  on infowars.com.
[1:08:12.020 --> 1:08:14.020]  YouTube eletes video exposing FBI
[1:08:14.020 --> 1:08:16.020]  stats on black crime.
[1:08:16.020 --> 1:08:18.020]  Watch here. And then we come back.
[1:08:18.020 --> 1:08:20.020]  Trump vilifies the elderly protester
[1:08:20.020 --> 1:08:22.020]  on his campaign struggles
[1:08:22.020 --> 1:08:24.020]  to relaunch. Really?
[1:08:24.020 --> 1:08:26.020]  We looked into this and why people are questioning
[1:08:26.020 --> 1:08:28.020]  what really happened. Is Trump right?
[1:08:28.020 --> 1:08:30.020]  Is it a false flag? Somebody attacked
[1:08:30.020 --> 1:08:32.020]  all those Jewish cemeteries and blamed him.
[1:08:32.020 --> 1:08:34.020]  Turns out it was a Jewish leftist.
[1:08:34.020 --> 1:08:36.020]  Just a small stage of stuff.
[1:08:36.020 --> 1:08:38.020]  So we've got to watch all this very carefully.
[1:08:38.020 --> 1:08:40.020]  Your full reports at Band-Aught Video.
[1:08:40.020 --> 1:08:42.020]  Hope folks share it. Here it is.
[1:08:42.020 --> 1:08:44.020]  Black Lives Matter is a lie.
[1:08:44.020 --> 1:08:46.020]  There is no genocide
[1:08:46.020 --> 1:08:48.020]  of young, innocent black men.
[1:08:48.020 --> 1:08:50.020]  In 2019,
[1:08:50.020 --> 1:08:52.020]  there were only 10 cases
[1:08:52.020 --> 1:08:54.020]  in which unarmed African Americans
[1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:56.020]  were fatally shot by the police.
[1:08:56.020 --> 1:08:58.020]  In 5
[1:08:58.020 --> 1:09:00.020]  out of 10 cases, an officer
[1:09:00.020 --> 1:09:02.020]  was attacked just before the shooting.
[1:09:02.020 --> 1:09:04.020]  And in 2 of the remaining
[1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:06.020]  4, the officer was
[1:09:06.020 --> 1:09:08.020]  criminally charged.
[1:09:08.020 --> 1:09:10.020]  Where is the injustice?
[1:09:10.020 --> 1:09:12.020]  Also in 2019,
[1:09:12.020 --> 1:09:14.020]  there were 25
[1:09:14.020 --> 1:09:16.020]  unarmed white Americans
[1:09:16.020 --> 1:09:18.020]  who were fatally shot by the police.
[1:09:18.020 --> 1:09:20.020]  According to FBI
[1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:22.020]  statistics, even though
[1:09:22.020 --> 1:09:24.020]  African Americans make up only
[1:09:24.020 --> 1:09:26.020]  13% of the population,
[1:09:26.020 --> 1:09:28.020]  they commit over 50%
[1:09:28.020 --> 1:09:30.020]  of all murder in America.
[1:09:30.020 --> 1:09:32.020]  Blacks kill 10
[1:09:32.020 --> 1:09:34.020]  times the amount of whites as
[1:09:34.020 --> 1:09:36.020]  whites kill blacks.
[1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:38.020]  And a police officer is 18
[1:09:38.020 --> 1:09:40.020]  and a half times more likely
[1:09:40.020 --> 1:09:42.020]  to be killed by a black male
[1:09:42.020 --> 1:09:44.020]  than an unarmed black male is
[1:09:44.020 --> 1:09:46.020]  to be killed by a police officer.
[1:09:46.020 --> 1:09:48.020]  Black Lives Matter
[1:09:48.020 --> 1:09:50.020]  has been a lie since its very beginning.
[1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:52.020]  In 2013,
[1:09:52.020 --> 1:09:54.020]  the movement began on social media
[1:09:54.020 --> 1:09:56.020]  after the acquittal of George Zimmerman
[1:09:56.020 --> 1:09:58.020]  in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.
[1:09:58.020 --> 1:10:00.020]  But the case against
[1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:02.020]  Zimmerman was a lie.
[1:10:02.020 --> 1:10:04.020]  The prosecution had used
[1:10:04.020 --> 1:10:06.020]  an imposter as a fake witness
[1:10:06.020 --> 1:10:08.020]  who they claimed
[1:10:08.020 --> 1:10:10.020]  wrote the only piece of criminal evidence they had.
[1:10:10.020 --> 1:10:12.020]  A letter that the fake witness
[1:10:12.020 --> 1:10:14.020]  admitted under oath to not writing.
[1:10:14.020 --> 1:10:16.020]  Founded
[1:10:16.020 --> 1:10:18.020]  by known communists
[1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:20.020]  and fueled with millions of dollars
[1:10:20.020 --> 1:10:22.020]  from George Soros,
[1:10:22.020 --> 1:10:24.020]  Black Lives Matter organized
[1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:26.020]  riots in Ferguson, Baltimore
[1:10:26.020 --> 1:10:28.020]  and Chicago
[1:10:28.020 --> 1:10:30.020]  and began recruiting an army
[1:10:30.020 --> 1:10:32.020]  of haters hiding beneath
[1:10:32.020 --> 1:10:34.020]  the guise of social justice.
[1:10:34.020 --> 1:10:36.020]  The entire foundation
[1:10:36.020 --> 1:10:38.020]  of Black Lives Matter is
[1:10:38.020 --> 1:10:40.020]  an obvious lie.
[1:10:40.020 --> 1:10:42.020]  And yet, the lie sells.
[1:10:42.020 --> 1:10:44.020]  It sells because communities
[1:10:44.020 --> 1:10:46.020]  have been broken by government programs
[1:10:46.020 --> 1:10:48.020]  such as LBJ's War on Poverty
[1:10:48.020 --> 1:10:50.020]  that incentivized single motherhood
[1:10:50.020 --> 1:10:52.020]  and got young people hooked
[1:10:52.020 --> 1:10:54.020]  on welfare handouts.
[1:10:54.020 --> 1:10:56.020]  It sells because
[1:10:56.020 --> 1:10:58.020]  people worship their favorite celebrities
[1:10:58.020 --> 1:11:00.020]  like false idols
[1:11:00.020 --> 1:11:02.020]  and believe the media is a source
[1:11:02.020 --> 1:11:04.020]  of undisputed truth.
[1:11:04.020 --> 1:11:06.020]  It sells because people are afraid
[1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:08.020]  of being called a racist
[1:11:08.020 --> 1:11:10.020]  even when they know it's a lie.
[1:11:10.020 --> 1:11:12.020]  It sells because many prefer their own rage
[1:11:12.020 --> 1:11:14.020]  over seeking the truth.
[1:11:14.020 --> 1:11:16.020]  Following the COVID-19 shutdown,
[1:11:16.020 --> 1:11:18.020]  perhaps
[1:11:18.020 --> 1:11:20.020]  the most traumatizing time
[1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:22.020]  for any American alive,
[1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:24.020]  Black Lives Matter joined forces
[1:11:24.020 --> 1:11:26.020]  with Antifa
[1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:28.020]  and used a senseless murder as an excuse
[1:11:28.020 --> 1:11:30.020]  to wage war
[1:11:30.020 --> 1:11:32.020]  upon the American people.
[1:11:32.020 --> 1:11:34.020]  Dragging innocent people from their cars,
[1:11:34.020 --> 1:11:36.020]  burning homes
[1:11:36.020 --> 1:11:38.020]  to the ground,
[1:11:38.020 --> 1:11:40.020]  including everything in sight
[1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:42.020]  and demanding that
[1:11:42.020 --> 1:11:44.020]  white people bow before them
[1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:46.020]  and kiss their feet.
[1:11:46.020 --> 1:11:48.020]  They are subjugating white people,
[1:11:48.020 --> 1:11:50.020]  creating them around in chains
[1:11:50.020 --> 1:11:52.020]  and demanding the dissolution
[1:11:52.020 --> 1:11:54.020]  of the police department.
[1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:56.020]  What do you suppose is coming next?
[1:11:56.020 --> 1:11:58.020]  Black Lives Matter
[1:11:58.020 --> 1:12:00.020]  is a dangerous cancer
[1:12:00.020 --> 1:12:02.020]  that is poisoning
[1:12:02.020 --> 1:12:04.020]  our already damaged society.
[1:12:04.020 --> 1:12:06.020]  The mainstream media
[1:12:06.020 --> 1:12:08.020]  our elected officials,
[1:12:08.020 --> 1:12:10.020]  world leaders
[1:12:10.020 --> 1:12:12.020]  and practically every multinational corporation
[1:12:12.020 --> 1:12:14.020]  are all on board
[1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:16.020]  with BLM.
[1:12:16.020 --> 1:12:18.020]  But the real problem is that we allow
[1:12:18.020 --> 1:12:20.020]  the lie to exist.
[1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:22.020]  When all we have to do
[1:12:22.020 --> 1:12:24.020]  is be brave, tell the truth
[1:12:24.020 --> 1:12:26.020]  and seek justice.
[1:12:26.020 --> 1:12:28.020]  In the end, we will get exactly
[1:12:28.020 --> 1:12:30.020]  what we deserve.
[1:12:30.020 --> 1:12:36.020]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Ries.
[1:12:48.020 --> 1:12:50.020]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news.
[1:12:50.020 --> 1:12:52.020]  Today.
[1:12:52.020 --> 1:12:54.020]  The United States is not communist China.
[1:12:54.020 --> 1:12:56.020]  We don't have 3 million people
[1:12:56.020 --> 1:12:58.020]  in concentration camps.
[1:12:58.020 --> 1:13:00.020]  We don't blow up churches.
[1:13:00.020 --> 1:13:02.020]  We don't kill political dissidents
[1:13:02.020 --> 1:13:04.020]  and sell their organs.
[1:13:04.020 --> 1:13:06.020]  But all over the news,
[1:13:06.020 --> 1:13:08.020]  we see the U.N. Billable Indigates,
[1:13:08.020 --> 1:13:10.020]  WHO, mainstream corporate media
[1:13:10.020 --> 1:13:12.020]  praising communist China
[1:13:12.020 --> 1:13:14.020]  for their response.
[1:13:14.020 --> 1:13:16.020]  And if communist China shoots women
[1:13:16.020 --> 1:13:18.020]  at checkpoints and welds people
[1:13:18.020 --> 1:13:20.020]  into their houses and has robots
[1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:22.020]  controlling people, well then, gee,
[1:13:22.020 --> 1:13:24.020]  we've got to do that.
[1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:26.020]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio
[1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:28.020]  and New York's calling it the European virus.
[1:13:28.020 --> 1:13:30.020]  These people are out of control.
[1:13:30.020 --> 1:13:32.020]  Control freaks.
[1:13:32.020 --> 1:13:34.020]  And they are going to lose big time
[1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:36.020]  because we, the people, are aware of their criminal activities
[1:13:36.020 --> 1:13:38.020]  and are exposing them in their power grab.
[1:13:38.020 --> 1:13:40.020]  The Resistance lives
[1:13:40.020 --> 1:13:42.020]  at band.video and infowars.com.
[1:13:42.020 --> 1:13:44.020]  Spread those links
[1:13:44.020 --> 1:13:46.020]  and jam it down the censors' throats
[1:13:46.020 --> 1:13:48.020]  and then we'll be able to defeat their operation
[1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:58.020]  that much quicker.
[1:14:18.020 --> 1:14:20.020]  We know iodine is an essential mineral
[1:14:20.020 --> 1:14:22.020]  that supports thyroid health,
[1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:24.020]  as well as healthy metabolism,
[1:14:24.020 --> 1:14:26.020]  healthy hormone levels,
[1:14:26.020 --> 1:14:28.020]  and healthy cognitive function.
[1:14:28.020 --> 1:14:30.020]  Iodine may also support your body
[1:14:30.020 --> 1:14:32.020]  and healthy response to environmental
[1:14:32.020 --> 1:14:34.020]  and dietary toxins.
[1:14:34.020 --> 1:14:36.020]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine
[1:14:36.020 --> 1:14:38.020]  and experience the benefits
[1:14:38.020 --> 1:14:40.020]  of true nascent iodine today.

[1:14:54.020 --> 1:14:56.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:06.020 --> 1:15:08.020]  There's a man
[1:15:08.020 --> 1:15:10.020]  going around taking names.
[1:15:10.020 --> 1:15:12.020]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:12.020 --> 1:15:14.020]  I am your host, Alex Jones
[1:15:14.020 --> 1:15:16.020]  and we're about to break down
[1:15:16.020 --> 1:15:18.020]  the definition of Agiprop
[1:15:18.020 --> 1:15:20.020]  for you here today.
[1:15:20.020 --> 1:15:22.020]  This is very, very important.
[1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:26.020]  And this is how the globalists operate.
[1:15:26.020 --> 1:15:28.020]  This is their game plan.
[1:15:28.020 --> 1:15:30.020]  They go out and
[1:15:30.020 --> 1:15:32.020]  they create crises.
[1:15:32.020 --> 1:15:34.020]  They create meltdowns
[1:15:34.020 --> 1:15:36.020]  to offer
[1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:38.020]  their solutions.
[1:15:38.020 --> 1:15:40.020]  Now, last week
[1:15:40.020 --> 1:15:42.020]  an old man in Buffalo, New York
[1:15:42.020 --> 1:15:44.020]  comes up to the police
[1:15:44.020 --> 1:15:46.020]  and
[1:15:46.020 --> 1:15:48.020]  is in their face and they bump him
[1:15:48.020 --> 1:15:50.020]  and
[1:15:50.020 --> 1:15:52.020]  he falls over when they barely touching.
[1:15:52.020 --> 1:15:54.020]  He comes over
[1:15:54.020 --> 1:15:56.020]  and starts touching the police. One officer barely touches him
[1:15:56.020 --> 1:15:58.020]  with what looks like
[1:15:58.020 --> 1:16:00.020]  one pound of force
[1:16:00.020 --> 1:16:02.020]  and he just flies back.
[1:16:02.020 --> 1:16:04.020]  Everybody knows when a kid's
[1:16:04.020 --> 1:16:06.020]  you know, in a
[1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:08.020]  play at middle school, they're not very good actors.
[1:16:08.020 --> 1:16:10.020]  Looks fake.
[1:16:10.020 --> 1:16:12.020]  Well, then the video came out
[1:16:12.020 --> 1:16:14.020]  and I checked the raw footage we're about to show
[1:16:14.020 --> 1:16:16.020]  and blood pours out of his ear
[1:16:16.020 --> 1:16:18.020]  and you can see a tube leading up to it
[1:16:18.020 --> 1:16:20.020]  that's been
[1:16:20.020 --> 1:16:22.020]  had makeup put over it, it looks like
[1:16:24.020 --> 1:16:26.020]  and then people actually went and found
[1:16:26.020 --> 1:16:28.020]  the stuntman gear that you wear on your back
[1:16:28.020 --> 1:16:30.020]  that actually goes up to the side of your ear
[1:16:30.020 --> 1:16:32.020]  to have a blood pack that then comes out.
[1:16:32.020 --> 1:16:34.020]  I'm saying that's what it looks like.
[1:16:34.020 --> 1:16:36.020]  Maybe it's real.
[1:16:36.020 --> 1:16:38.020]  Maybe all this is just bizarre.
[1:16:38.020 --> 1:16:40.020]  But regardless, Trump
[1:16:40.020 --> 1:16:42.020]  vilifies elderly
[1:16:42.020 --> 1:16:44.020]  protestors as his campaign struggles
[1:16:44.020 --> 1:16:46.020]  to relaunch.
[1:16:46.020 --> 1:16:48.020]  Buffalo protestors shoved by police could be
[1:16:48.020 --> 1:16:50.020]  an antivirocateur. A 75-year-old
[1:16:50.020 --> 1:16:52.020]  Martin
[1:16:52.020 --> 1:16:54.020]  Grino
[1:16:54.020 --> 1:16:56.020]  was pushed away after appearing to scan
[1:16:56.020 --> 1:16:58.020]  police communications in order to break
[1:16:58.020 --> 1:17:00.020]  out the equipment.
[1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:02.020]  OAN comes out with it.
[1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:04.020]  He fell harder
[1:17:04.020 --> 1:17:06.020]  than he was pushed.
[1:17:06.020 --> 1:17:08.020]  He was aiming scanner.
[1:17:08.020 --> 1:17:10.020]  Could it be a setup?
[1:17:10.020 --> 1:17:12.020]  Well, we've got the raw videos
[1:17:12.020 --> 1:17:14.020]  of him clearly before this, scanning
[1:17:14.020 --> 1:17:16.020]  the police
[1:17:16.020 --> 1:17:18.020]  equipment
[1:17:18.020 --> 1:17:20.020]  which is
[1:17:22.020 --> 1:17:24.020]  an NFC hack.
[1:17:24.020 --> 1:17:26.020]  There's big articles
[1:17:26.020 --> 1:17:28.020]  on that.
[1:17:28.020 --> 1:17:30.020]  NFC
[1:17:30.020 --> 1:17:32.020]  Drive By Hack
[1:17:32.020 --> 1:17:34.020]  Look it up yourself. NFC exploit.
[1:17:34.020 --> 1:17:36.020]  Be very, very careful what your smart
[1:17:36.020 --> 1:17:38.020]  phone gets near CNN
[1:17:38.020 --> 1:17:40.020]  money.
[1:17:40.020 --> 1:17:42.020]  So he's got his phone going up
[1:17:42.020 --> 1:17:44.020]  in multiple videos, showing it again for
[1:17:44.020 --> 1:17:46.020]  TV viewers, literally coming up to police
[1:17:46.020 --> 1:17:48.020]  and putting it up to their
[1:17:48.020 --> 1:17:50.020]  phones and
[1:17:50.020 --> 1:17:52.020]  attempting to touch them.
[1:17:52.020 --> 1:17:54.020]  So another officer comes over
[1:17:54.020 --> 1:17:56.020]  while the guy's got his phone right up to
[1:17:56.020 --> 1:17:58.020]  him and barely
[1:17:58.020 --> 1:18:00.020]  pushes him back and he just
[1:18:00.020 --> 1:18:02.020]  falls over and then blood
[1:18:02.020 --> 1:18:04.020]  doesn't pour out the back of his head.
[1:18:04.020 --> 1:18:06.020]  Blood
[1:18:06.020 --> 1:18:08.020]  pours out of his ear. It's got a weird
[1:18:08.020 --> 1:18:10.020]  looks like makeuped over
[1:18:10.020 --> 1:18:12.020]  tube going up. Maybe he's just got a weird looking
[1:18:12.020 --> 1:18:14.020]  vein that swiggles sideways like nothing I've
[1:18:14.020 --> 1:18:16.020]  ever seen.
[1:18:16.020 --> 1:18:18.020]  Now let's go ahead
[1:18:18.020 --> 1:18:20.020]  here
[1:18:20.020 --> 1:18:22.020]  and go to the first video. This is
[1:18:22.020 --> 1:18:24.020]  one American news.
[1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:26.020]  Old man
[1:18:26.020 --> 1:18:28.020]  starts at one minute, shows
[1:18:28.020 --> 1:18:30.020]  what Trump is referring to. Here it is.
[1:18:30.020 --> 1:18:32.020]  However, newly released videos
[1:18:32.020 --> 1:18:34.020]  appear to show Gujino using
[1:18:34.020 --> 1:18:36.020]  a police tracker on his phone
[1:18:36.020 --> 1:18:38.020]  trying to scan police communications
[1:18:38.020 --> 1:18:40.020]  during the protest.
[1:18:40.020 --> 1:18:42.020]  The tactic known as skimming is
[1:18:42.020 --> 1:18:44.020]  an old trick used by Antifa
[1:18:44.020 --> 1:18:46.020]  to locate police officers and plan
[1:18:46.020 --> 1:18:48.020]  violent activities by passing
[1:18:48.020 --> 1:18:50.020]  the police response. In addition
[1:18:50.020 --> 1:18:52.020]  the 75 year old who's been
[1:18:52.020 --> 1:18:54.020]  referred to as an agitator
[1:18:54.020 --> 1:18:56.020]  was supposedly using the technology to
[1:18:56.020 --> 1:18:58.020]  black out police communications.
[1:18:58.020 --> 1:19:00.020]  That however didn't quite work
[1:19:00.020 --> 1:19:02.020]  and many Buffalo police officers
[1:19:02.020 --> 1:19:04.020]  support their embattled colleagues.
[1:19:04.020 --> 1:19:06.020]  And they were applauded by
[1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:08.020]  their colleagues as they left the courthouse.
[1:19:08.020 --> 1:19:10.020]  Officers Robert McCabe
[1:19:10.020 --> 1:19:12.020]  and Aaron Torgalski pleaded not guilty.
[1:19:12.020 --> 1:19:14.020]  The arrest of McCabe
[1:19:14.020 --> 1:19:16.020]  and Torgalski and subsequent resignations
[1:19:16.020 --> 1:19:18.020]  by 57 of their fellow
[1:19:18.020 --> 1:19:20.020]  officers on the unit sparked
[1:19:20.020 --> 1:19:22.020]  concerns of public safety in the city.
[1:19:22.020 --> 1:19:24.020]  Meanwhile, mainstream
[1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:26.020]  media failed to acknowledge the controversy
[1:19:26.020 --> 1:19:28.020]  and were continuing to push
[1:19:28.020 --> 1:19:30.020]  the narrative of so called police brutality.
[1:19:30.020 --> 1:19:32.020]  Okay, so Martin
[1:19:32.020 --> 1:19:34.020]  Gujino, if you blow up the video
[1:19:34.020 --> 1:19:36.020]  it's the raw footage, has
[1:19:36.020 --> 1:19:38.020]  blood that starts pouring out of his ear
[1:19:38.020 --> 1:19:40.020]  but not out of the
[1:19:40.020 --> 1:19:42.020]  back of his head.
[1:19:42.020 --> 1:19:44.020]  And it looks just like
[1:19:44.020 --> 1:19:46.020]  that blood and you can even see
[1:19:46.020 --> 1:19:48.020]  like the earpiece there. It looks just like
[1:19:48.020 --> 1:19:50.020]  the blood that you see in Hollywood
[1:19:50.020 --> 1:19:52.020]  films that look so fake.
[1:19:52.020 --> 1:19:54.020]  But you see him fall back, he literally
[1:19:54.020 --> 1:19:56.020]  barely touch him, he falls back. You see him
[1:19:56.020 --> 1:19:58.020]  putting his phone up, everybody's scanning it.
[1:20:00.020 --> 1:20:02.020]  This is just incredible
[1:20:02.020 --> 1:20:04.020]  and I've had them
[1:20:04.020 --> 1:20:06.020]  try to set me up. I've had an entity
[1:20:06.020 --> 1:20:08.020]  for you seen it try to set me up everywhere.
[1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:10.020]  Just last week they said we burned down a homeless camp
[1:20:10.020 --> 1:20:12.020]  even though they're on video. Mainstream news said
[1:20:12.020 --> 1:20:14.020]  we burned it down. I wasn't even there.
[1:20:14.020 --> 1:20:16.020]  Our crime was having
[1:20:16.020 --> 1:20:18.020]  a crew there to show them burning it.
[1:20:18.020 --> 1:20:20.020]  And they start fights with me in restaurants
[1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:22.020]  and then edit the tape to make it look like I'm attacking
[1:20:22.020 --> 1:20:24.020]  them and the media goes with this.
[1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:26.020]  So let's look at some of these articles
[1:20:26.020 --> 1:20:28.020]  right here. Doc Mcamp shot please.
[1:20:28.020 --> 1:20:30.020]  Here he is with this line up his back
[1:20:30.020 --> 1:20:32.020]  and then he's got
[1:20:32.020 --> 1:20:34.020]  if you zoom in you can see
[1:20:34.020 --> 1:20:36.020]  what looks
[1:20:36.020 --> 1:20:38.020]  like a tube going up
[1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:40.020]  to his neck.
[1:20:40.020 --> 1:20:42.020]  And
[1:20:42.020 --> 1:20:44.020]  there's similar systems like this that are used in Hollywood.
[1:20:44.020 --> 1:20:46.020]  Here he is
[1:20:46.020 --> 1:20:48.020]  and the blood
[1:20:48.020 --> 1:20:50.020]  is again pouring out
[1:20:50.020 --> 1:20:52.020]  of his ear just absolutely
[1:20:52.020 --> 1:20:54.020]  bizarre.
[1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:56.020]  And there's other photos that show what looks like a tube
[1:20:56.020 --> 1:20:58.020]  up his neck that's got makeup on it.
[1:20:58.020 --> 1:21:00.020]  Maybe he's just got interesting looking veins.
[1:21:00.020 --> 1:21:02.020]  Oh here he is on his phone inside the ambulance
[1:21:02.020 --> 1:21:04.020]  but they say you know he's in critical condition.
[1:21:04.020 --> 1:21:06.020]  All I know is he's out there
[1:21:06.020 --> 1:21:08.020]  in people's faces. Here's another clip.
[1:21:08.020 --> 1:21:10.020]  Old man agitating shows Martin
[1:21:10.020 --> 1:21:12.020]  being confronted by other protesters
[1:21:12.020 --> 1:21:14.020]  black protesters one says looks like
[1:21:14.020 --> 1:21:16.020]  he wants to get punched in the face.
[1:21:16.020 --> 1:21:18.020]  Here's the video.
[1:21:18.020 --> 1:21:20.020]  He's looking to get punched in the face.
[1:21:20.020 --> 1:21:22.020]  He's looking to get punched in the face.
[1:21:22.020 --> 1:21:24.020]  He's looking to get fired.
[1:21:24.020 --> 1:21:26.020]  I was just
[1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:28.020]  crying over there. It was a moment of silence.
[1:21:28.020 --> 1:21:30.020]  What's
[1:21:30.020 --> 1:21:32.020]  going on here? Fill me in.
[1:21:32.020 --> 1:21:34.020]  I
[1:21:34.020 --> 1:21:36.020]  was just
[1:21:36.020 --> 1:21:38.020]  crying.
[1:21:38.020 --> 1:21:40.020]  I was
[1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:42.020]  just crying.
[1:21:42.020 --> 1:21:44.020]  So what if somebody comes
[1:21:44.020 --> 1:21:46.020]  up to you over and over again
[1:21:46.020 --> 1:21:48.020]  and there's more video of this
[1:21:48.020 --> 1:21:50.020]  and just keeps putting his phone up against your phone
[1:21:50.020 --> 1:21:52.020]  up against your pants, up against your side.
[1:21:52.020 --> 1:21:54.020]  What are you going to do? You're going to push him off of you.
[1:21:54.020 --> 1:21:56.020]  And he'd been out there all day
[1:21:56.020 --> 1:21:58.020]  according to protesters starting stuff
[1:21:58.020 --> 1:22:00.020]  with the police and they didn't want that.
[1:22:00.020 --> 1:22:02.020]  They wanted to protest against police brutality.
[1:22:02.020 --> 1:22:04.020]  They didn't want to cause a problem but here's
[1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:06.020]  the agitator. We need to look into this guy
[1:22:06.020 --> 1:22:08.020]  and you know research exactly what's going on.
[1:22:08.020 --> 1:22:10.020]  And then whoop
[1:22:10.020 --> 1:22:12.020]  he just the minute they touch him he just
[1:22:12.020 --> 1:22:14.020]  oh he flies back
[1:22:14.020 --> 1:22:16.020]  and then he hits his head. And maybe he really did hit his head.
[1:22:16.020 --> 1:22:18.020]  Maybe some, we can talk to a medical doctor.
[1:22:18.020 --> 1:22:20.020]  I never knew like you hit your back of your head. They're hitting blood there.
[1:22:20.020 --> 1:22:22.020]  It just comes out the side of your ear.
[1:22:22.020 --> 1:22:24.020]  And it comes out real thick too.
[1:22:24.020 --> 1:22:26.020]  What kind of big artery
[1:22:26.020 --> 1:22:28.020]  there is inside the head that broke?
[1:22:28.020 --> 1:22:30.020]  I mean maybe he's an old guy. Maybe
[1:22:30.020 --> 1:22:32.020]  maybe that's what's happening on the way he just
[1:22:32.020 --> 1:22:34.020]  had the phone in his hand and lets it go limp.
[1:22:34.020 --> 1:22:36.020]  You know we've seen the white helmet
[1:22:36.020 --> 1:22:38.020]  stage stuff.
[1:22:38.020 --> 1:22:40.020]  Chemical attacks. We've seen
[1:22:40.020 --> 1:22:42.020]  smaller stage stuff. ABC stage
[1:22:42.020 --> 1:22:44.020]  attacks. I mean we've seen this
[1:22:44.020 --> 1:22:46.020]  over and over again
[1:22:46.020 --> 1:22:48.020]  and we all know it when we in basketball
[1:22:48.020 --> 1:22:50.020]  and soccer and football with fake fouls
[1:22:50.020 --> 1:22:52.020]  where somebody doesn't really touch you but you fall down.
[1:22:52.020 --> 1:22:54.020]  Everybody knows
[1:22:54.020 --> 1:22:56.020]  about it. You know fake when you see it
[1:22:56.020 --> 1:22:58.020]  and you know looks fake to me.
[1:23:00.020 --> 1:23:02.020]  Kind of like when I'm at the mall and I see a big fat guy
[1:23:02.020 --> 1:23:04.020]  with a white beard and they say it's Santa Claus.
[1:23:04.020 --> 1:23:06.020]  Hey Santa Claus doesn't exist. So I know
[1:23:06.020 --> 1:23:08.020]  it's fake. Plus I can see it's a fake beard.
[1:23:08.020 --> 1:23:10.020]  Again I could be at a
[1:23:10.020 --> 1:23:12.020]  Havardy's clothing store
[1:23:12.020 --> 1:23:14.020]  or Havardy's furniture store and they got a bowl
[1:23:14.020 --> 1:23:16.020]  of fake fruit 50 yards away
[1:23:16.020 --> 1:23:18.020]  in a showroom of furniture. Why don't I walk over
[1:23:18.020 --> 1:23:20.020]  and have a banana or an apple. I can see
[1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:22.020]  it's fake. I know it's fake.
[1:23:22.020 --> 1:23:24.020]  You have a degree in plastics son?
[1:23:24.020 --> 1:23:26.020]  Well no I just go plastic when I see it.
[1:23:26.020 --> 1:23:28.020]  So yeah Trump's right again just like you said
[1:23:28.020 --> 1:23:30.020]  the attacks on the Jewish centers were stage
[1:23:30.020 --> 1:23:32.020]  because he had state police that told him came out a month later
[1:23:32.020 --> 1:23:34.020]  it was indeed stage.
[1:23:34.020 --> 1:23:36.020]  So Trump is telling it like it is
[1:23:36.020 --> 1:23:38.020]  maybe it's real
[1:23:38.020 --> 1:23:40.020]  you know that plastic fruit looks pretty
[1:23:40.020 --> 1:23:42.020]  real these days. Maybe I'm wrong.
[1:23:42.020 --> 1:23:44.020]  We're all out to question Jesse
[1:23:44.020 --> 1:23:46.020]  Smollett and all these
[1:23:46.020 --> 1:23:48.020]  people and we will continue to question them.
[1:23:48.020 --> 1:23:50.020]  The people of the world have
[1:23:50.020 --> 1:23:52.020]  awakened to globalism.
[1:23:52.020 --> 1:23:54.020]  And so populist movements are throwing
[1:23:54.020 --> 1:23:56.020]  the globalist out of their
[1:23:56.020 --> 1:23:58.020]  countries. That's why the New World Order
[1:23:58.020 --> 1:24:00.020]  is instituting race war and division
[1:24:00.020 --> 1:24:02.020]  and telling the people that
[1:24:02.020 --> 1:24:04.020]  rebellion is about overthrowing
[1:24:04.020 --> 1:24:06.020]  your local police and
[1:24:06.020 --> 1:24:08.020]  government and destroying essential services.
[1:24:08.020 --> 1:24:10.020]  This is an attempt
[1:24:10.020 --> 1:24:12.020]  to have society collapse
[1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:14.020]  and the globalists as they've done in the
[1:24:14.020 --> 1:24:16.020]  third world will come in and pick up
[1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:18.020]  the pieces. We must stand against
[1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:20.020]  the UN, the IMF, the World Bank
[1:24:20.020 --> 1:24:22.020]  and the EU openly saying
[1:24:22.020 --> 1:24:24.020]  we fund the police. The police
[1:24:24.020 --> 1:24:26.020]  have a lot of problems. We all have a lot of problems
[1:24:26.020 --> 1:24:28.020]  but this is our government and our local
[1:24:28.020 --> 1:24:30.020]  tabulary and believe me once the globalists
[1:24:30.020 --> 1:24:32.020]  have overthrown this country
[1:24:32.020 --> 1:24:34.020]  they're going to put in a real police
[1:24:34.020 --> 1:24:36.020]  state where you have no due process or freedom.
[1:24:36.020 --> 1:24:38.020]  The globalist believe communist China is the model
[1:24:38.020 --> 1:24:40.020]  of the world and
[1:24:40.020 --> 1:24:42.020]  they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[1:24:42.020 --> 1:24:44.020]  The people helping them are collaborators
[1:24:44.020 --> 1:24:46.020]  and are idiots and must be opposed
[1:24:46.020 --> 1:24:48.020]  infowars.com
[1:24:48.020 --> 1:24:50.020]  It's finally here

[1:25:44.020 --> 1:25:46.020]  at infowarsstore.com
[1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:50.020]  Feudalism in the ancient world
[1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:52.020]  from Asia to Europe
[1:25:52.020 --> 1:25:54.020]  from Africa to Latin America
[1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:56.020]  was the most common form of government.
[1:25:56.020 --> 1:25:58.020]  You had a ruling class
[1:25:58.020 --> 1:26:00.020]  of the king and queen sitting on top of it
[1:26:00.020 --> 1:26:02.020]  and the rest of the public were kept
[1:26:02.020 --> 1:26:04.020]  at a subsistence starving level
[1:26:04.020 --> 1:26:06.020]  for control.
[1:26:06.020 --> 1:26:08.020]  In fact, in most cultures
[1:26:08.020 --> 1:26:10.020]  they call the peasants the little people
[1:26:10.020 --> 1:26:12.020]  because they were usually a foot or more
[1:26:12.020 --> 1:26:14.020]  shorter than the lords and ladies
[1:26:14.020 --> 1:26:16.020]  because they kept them again
[1:26:16.020 --> 1:26:18.020]  at a starving level.
[1:26:18.020 --> 1:26:20.020]  They were so busy trying to survive
[1:26:20.020 --> 1:26:22.020]  they would never try to challenge
[1:26:22.020 --> 1:26:24.020]  the entrenched elite. Well, now all the big
[1:26:24.020 --> 1:26:26.020]  Google owners and the Rockefellers
[1:26:26.020 --> 1:26:28.020]  and the childs, the Jeff Bezos
[1:26:28.020 --> 1:26:30.020]  is the world. They're sitting back on their giant
[1:26:30.020 --> 1:26:32.020]  estates with their jet helicopters
[1:26:32.020 --> 1:26:34.020]  and private jets living the life
[1:26:34.020 --> 1:26:36.020]  laughing at you
[1:26:36.020 --> 1:26:38.020]  shut down, going bankrupt
[1:26:38.020 --> 1:26:40.020]  in the third world starving to death.
[1:26:40.020 --> 1:26:42.020]  Their religion is power and control
[1:26:42.020 --> 1:26:44.020]  and they are pressing
[1:26:44.020 --> 1:26:46.020]  that advantage against us.
[1:26:46.020 --> 1:26:56.020]  We must break free from these monsters.
[1:27:16.020 --> 1:27:26.020]  The same. We have a constitution.
[1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:28.020]  We have to follow the constitution
[1:27:28.020 --> 1:27:30.020]  and the presidents drifted away from it.
[1:27:30.020 --> 1:27:32.020]  I'm so proud of what these generals
[1:27:32.020 --> 1:27:34.020]  and admirals have done and others have done.
[1:27:34.020 --> 1:27:36.020]  But you know, I didn't write a letter
[1:27:36.020 --> 1:27:38.020]  because I made my point with respect
[1:27:38.020 --> 1:27:40.020]  to Trump's performance some four years ago
[1:27:40.020 --> 1:27:42.020]  when he was running for office
[1:27:42.020 --> 1:27:44.020]  and when I heard some of the things he was saying
[1:27:44.020 --> 1:27:46.020]  it made it clear that I could not
[1:27:46.020 --> 1:27:48.020]  possibly vote for this individual.
[1:27:48.020 --> 1:27:50.020]  Well, that makes me want Trump even more.
[1:27:50.020 --> 1:27:52.020]  This is the guy that lied to us about WNBs.
[1:27:52.020 --> 1:27:54.020]  This is the guy that lied to us
[1:27:54.020 --> 1:27:56.020]  about the Mealime massacre.
[1:27:56.020 --> 1:27:58.020]  This is a guy that is literally
[1:27:58.020 --> 1:28:00.020]  a stuffed shirt
[1:28:00.020 --> 1:28:02.020]  fake general paper tiger
[1:28:02.020 --> 1:28:04.020]  and now you've got Mitt Romney
[1:28:04.020 --> 1:28:06.020]  you've got George W. Bush
[1:28:06.020 --> 1:28:08.020]  all of them saying they're endorsing
[1:28:08.020 --> 1:28:10.020]  the weirdo globalist
[1:28:10.020 --> 1:28:12.020]  kleptocrat
[1:28:12.020 --> 1:28:14.020]  Joe Biden who's just a placeholder
[1:28:14.020 --> 1:28:16.020]  for whoever they're planning to slide in
[1:28:16.020 --> 1:28:18.020]  at the DNC coming up
[1:28:18.020 --> 1:28:20.020]  in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[1:28:20.020 --> 1:28:22.020]  Richard Reeves is a good friend of mine.
[1:28:22.020 --> 1:28:24.020]  He's the first guy that told me Trump was going to run for president.
[1:28:24.020 --> 1:28:26.020]  Long before he did, he was dead right about that.
[1:28:26.020 --> 1:28:28.020]  He's been a delegate to the RNC
[1:28:28.020 --> 1:28:30.020]  and he's been on the inside of it
[1:28:30.020 --> 1:28:32.020]  and predicted how they try to take the delegates
[1:28:32.020 --> 1:28:34.020]  and then how they try to not
[1:28:34.020 --> 1:28:36.020]  let him be seated as president
[1:28:36.020 --> 1:28:38.020]  and so he's here now to lay out
[1:28:38.020 --> 1:28:40.020]  what he told me months ago.
[1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:42.020]  He said they're going to try to take the nomination
[1:28:42.020 --> 1:28:44.020]  at the RNC.
[1:28:44.020 --> 1:28:46.020]  They're going to have a bunch of events
[1:28:46.020 --> 1:28:48.020]  and a bunch of protests as the cover for it.
[1:28:48.020 --> 1:28:50.020]  Well now Mitt Romney and the neocons
[1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:52.020]  are starting to actually go in that direction.
[1:28:52.020 --> 1:28:54.020]  They have the Republican Party National
[1:28:54.020 --> 1:28:56.020]  share that
[1:28:56.020 --> 1:28:58.020]  controls the purse
[1:28:58.020 --> 1:29:00.020]  for the Republican organizations on campus.
[1:29:00.020 --> 1:29:02.020]  That is
[1:29:02.020 --> 1:29:04.020]  saying they're not endorsing Trump.
[1:29:04.020 --> 1:29:06.020]  So the entire Republican establishment
[1:29:06.020 --> 1:29:08.020]  if you think they were after Trump
[1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:10.020]  years ago, get ready now
[1:29:10.020 --> 1:29:12.020]  and there are procedures where they think
[1:29:12.020 --> 1:29:14.020]  legally and lawfully they can block it.
[1:29:14.020 --> 1:29:16.020]  Remember George Will
[1:29:16.020 --> 1:29:18.020]  said in an op-ed four years ago,
[1:29:18.020 --> 1:29:20.020]  we don't care what the general public wants
[1:29:20.020 --> 1:29:22.020]  or what Republican Party people want.
[1:29:22.020 --> 1:29:24.020]  We don't care about that.
[1:29:24.020 --> 1:29:26.020]  We don't care.
[1:29:26.020 --> 1:29:28.020]  We
[1:29:28.020 --> 1:29:30.020]  in the Republican Party will decide
[1:29:30.020 --> 1:29:32.020]  who the nominee will be. Well they failed.
[1:29:32.020 --> 1:29:34.020]  Then Trump brought the economy back.
[1:29:34.020 --> 1:29:36.020]  We brought it back.
[1:29:36.020 --> 1:29:38.020]  Now the riot hoax
[1:29:38.020 --> 1:29:40.020]  that they're all coming in the Republicans against Trump
[1:29:40.020 --> 1:29:42.020]  on saying it's all his fault
[1:29:42.020 --> 1:29:44.020]  when they're the authors of it.
[1:29:44.020 --> 1:29:46.020]  It's totally transparent and they're hoping
[1:29:46.020 --> 1:29:48.020]  that we don't have a memory.
[1:29:48.020 --> 1:29:50.020]  So here in the next few segments Richard Reeves is joining us
[1:29:50.020 --> 1:29:52.020]  to lay out the strategy
[1:29:52.020 --> 1:29:54.020]  of how they plan to have this coup
[1:29:54.020 --> 1:29:56.020]  this bloodless coup
[1:29:56.020 --> 1:29:58.020]  I guess the fourth coup
[1:29:58.020 --> 1:30:00.020]  against President Trump
[1:30:00.020 --> 1:30:02.020]  this next attempted coup.
[1:30:02.020 --> 1:30:04.020]  Well that's exactly what we've seen Alex
[1:30:04.020 --> 1:30:06.020]  this next attempted coup after another.
[1:30:06.020 --> 1:30:08.020]  This is totally a attack, attack, attack
[1:30:08.020 --> 1:30:10.020]  and so the RNC
[1:30:10.020 --> 1:30:12.020]  is another Achilles heel coming up.
[1:30:12.020 --> 1:30:14.020]  The convention schedules
[1:30:14.020 --> 1:30:16.020]  have been totally upended by the Wuhan.
[1:30:16.020 --> 1:30:18.020]  The Wuhan has upended
[1:30:18.020 --> 1:30:20.020]  all the convention schedules. We should
[1:30:20.020 --> 1:30:22.020]  here in Texas we should have already wrapped up
[1:30:22.020 --> 1:30:24.020]  our state convention. That didn't happen.
[1:30:24.020 --> 1:30:26.020]  We haven't even had our senatorial district
[1:30:26.020 --> 1:30:28.020]  conventions. There's a lot of reasons they did
[1:30:28.020 --> 1:30:30.020]  cover the medical tyranny, the global ID,
[1:30:30.020 --> 1:30:32.020]  the UN
[1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:34.020]  the big one is mail-in ballots, email ballots
[1:30:34.020 --> 1:30:36.020]  and then upending the normal
[1:30:36.020 --> 1:30:38.020]  process for Democrats and Republicans
[1:30:38.020 --> 1:30:40.020]  to be able to shoehorn whoever they want in over
[1:30:40.020 --> 1:30:42.020]  Biden and to pull hanky-panky
[1:30:42.020 --> 1:30:44.020]  right now with Trump.
[1:30:44.020 --> 1:30:46.020]  Totally, well it just makes sense. We've been talking
[1:30:46.020 --> 1:30:48.020]  about the potentiality of Joe Biden
[1:30:48.020 --> 1:30:50.020]  just being a placeholder, a nomination
[1:30:50.020 --> 1:30:52.020]  of the Democrat party. It just makes sense
[1:30:52.020 --> 1:30:54.020]  that they would be angling at the Republican
[1:30:54.020 --> 1:30:56.020]  convention as well. And the
[1:30:56.020 --> 1:30:58.020]  danger is right now since the Wuhan did
[1:30:58.020 --> 1:31:00.020]  upend all of the convention
[1:31:00.020 --> 1:31:02.020]  schedules, then a lot of people
[1:31:02.020 --> 1:31:04.020]  think it's a foregone conclusion
[1:31:04.020 --> 1:31:06.020]  that Trump will get the nomination at the
[1:31:06.020 --> 1:31:08.020]  RNC, but that could not be
[1:31:08.020 --> 1:31:10.020]  that potentially could not be the case because
[1:31:10.020 --> 1:31:12.020]  the Mitt Romney wing, the Bush
[1:31:12.020 --> 1:31:14.020]  wing, the McCain wing, the Lindsey
[1:31:14.020 --> 1:31:16.020]  Graham wing still exists in the Republican
[1:31:16.020 --> 1:31:18.020]  party and last week when Trump
[1:31:18.020 --> 1:31:20.020]  went out to the church
[1:31:20.020 --> 1:31:22.020]  and held up that Bible, you know, you had
[1:31:22.020 --> 1:31:24.020]  a lot of senators that would not back up
[1:31:24.020 --> 1:31:26.020]  Donald Trump when that happened.
[1:31:26.020 --> 1:31:28.020]  Yeah, the president can't show
[1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:30.020]  support for God. Right.
[1:31:30.020 --> 1:31:32.020]  Well, he's a human being, he's allowed,
[1:31:32.020 --> 1:31:34.020]  everything he does they say is evil.
[1:31:34.020 --> 1:31:36.020]  Right, exactly. He can do no right.
[1:31:36.020 --> 1:31:38.020]  It's like I heard one talk show
[1:31:38.020 --> 1:31:40.020]  Jose one time that if Donald Trump
[1:31:40.020 --> 1:31:42.020]  walked on water they would say, oh look
[1:31:42.020 --> 1:31:44.020]  Donald Trump can't swim. It's like
[1:31:44.020 --> 1:31:46.020]  he can do nothing right. So
[1:31:46.020 --> 1:31:48.020]  Donald Trump, that's just it. That's where
[1:31:48.020 --> 1:31:50.020]  you're at. They're always going to
[1:31:50.020 --> 1:31:52.020]  criticize you. He was showing respect for God
[1:31:52.020 --> 1:31:54.020]  and holding it above his head like preachers do.
[1:31:54.020 --> 1:31:56.020]  This is the law. He was saying this is it.
[1:31:56.020 --> 1:31:58.020]  Right. They said it was a disrespect.
[1:31:58.020 --> 1:32:00.020]  This is the law and also
[1:32:00.020 --> 1:32:02.020]  as we saw the mainstream media
[1:32:02.020 --> 1:32:04.020]  worldwide and nationwide
[1:32:04.020 --> 1:32:06.020]  focused on the little bit of police
[1:32:06.020 --> 1:32:08.020]  roughing up the crowd in Lafayette
[1:32:08.020 --> 1:32:10.020]  Square, in Lafayette Park.
[1:32:10.020 --> 1:32:12.020]  But meanwhile all over the country,
[1:32:12.020 --> 1:32:14.020]  you know, they don't talk about that hardly at all
[1:32:14.020 --> 1:32:16.020]  that, oh look at the tyranny
[1:32:16.020 --> 1:32:18.020]  to me the George. The church is getting
[1:32:18.020 --> 1:32:20.020]  burned but here's the deal. They're afraid of
[1:32:20.020 --> 1:32:22.020]  Trump really embracing
[1:32:22.020 --> 1:32:24.020]  God and he's gone to the pro-life events
[1:32:24.020 --> 1:32:26.020]  where the president did that. They're afraid of him
[1:32:26.020 --> 1:32:28.020]  activating his base. He needs
[1:32:28.020 --> 1:32:30.020]  to really have more prayer rallies. He needs
[1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:32.020]  to fully, you know, say that he's
[1:32:32.020 --> 1:32:34.020]  accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior. The system
[1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:36.020]  is so scared of that. It's the right thing to do.
[1:32:36.020 --> 1:32:38.020]  I know Trump's a Christian. I know folks that
[1:32:38.020 --> 1:32:40.020]  know him privately. I know behind the scenes
[1:32:40.020 --> 1:32:42.020]  Roger Stone stuff. I mean Billy Graham
[1:32:42.020 --> 1:32:44.020]  Jr. you know really did,
[1:32:44.020 --> 1:32:46.020]  Franklin Graham really did have a come to Jesus
[1:32:46.020 --> 1:32:48.020]  moment with Roger because there are no
[1:32:48.020 --> 1:32:50.020]  atheists and foxholes. You're either a devil worshiper
[1:32:50.020 --> 1:32:52.020]  or you're with God. Right. And I
[1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:54.020]  wish Trump would openly do that plus
[1:32:54.020 --> 1:32:56.020]  become the educator in chief because
[1:32:56.020 --> 1:32:58.020]  it's like, you know, you mentioned Roger Stone a while
[1:32:58.020 --> 1:33:00.020]  ago. Roger Stone that
[1:33:00.020 --> 1:33:02.020]  we heard about the judicial
[1:33:02.020 --> 1:33:04.020]  malfeasance going on on this show
[1:33:04.020 --> 1:33:06.020]  on Info Wars back, I guess it was
[1:33:06.020 --> 1:33:08.020]  about two years ago when you were talking about it
[1:33:08.020 --> 1:33:10.020]  when the case was going on when they were selecting the
[1:33:10.020 --> 1:33:12.020]  jury when it was going on. Well, it didn't really hit
[1:33:12.020 --> 1:33:14.020]  the mainstream in a big way until
[1:33:14.020 --> 1:33:16.020]  Donald Trump talks about it, you know, and
[1:33:16.020 --> 1:33:18.020]  it's like this show is powerful. This
[1:33:18.020 --> 1:33:20.020]  is actually the most important audience
[1:33:20.020 --> 1:33:22.020]  on the whole planet and thank you for giving
[1:33:22.020 --> 1:33:24.020]  me the opportunity to speak. No, please, I told you
[1:33:24.020 --> 1:33:26.020]  not to thank me. Well, I broke that rule.
[1:33:26.020 --> 1:33:28.020]  I'm thinking, I'm thinking. No one does anything I want
[1:33:28.020 --> 1:33:30.020]  around here. Alright.
[1:33:30.020 --> 1:33:32.020]  Richard, it's not about me.
[1:33:32.020 --> 1:33:34.020]  It's about the audience of activists taking action.
[1:33:34.020 --> 1:33:36.020]  So, yes, but
[1:33:36.020 --> 1:33:38.020]  yes, this is an influential broadcast because it doesn't
[1:33:38.020 --> 1:33:40.020]  have a filter. The globalists don't control it
[1:33:40.020 --> 1:33:42.020]  and they're scared of what we do here, but
[1:33:42.020 --> 1:33:44.020]  let's get into how they're planning to go after Trump. Okay.
[1:33:44.020 --> 1:33:46.020]  Okay. Well, it's real simple since
[1:33:46.020 --> 1:33:48.020]  the convention schedule has been upended
[1:33:48.020 --> 1:33:50.020]  the potentiality
[1:33:50.020 --> 1:33:52.020]  for the McCain wing, the Romney wing
[1:33:52.020 --> 1:33:54.020]  of still out there
[1:33:54.020 --> 1:33:56.020]  delegates and Democrat or Republicans
[1:33:56.020 --> 1:33:58.020]  are going to try to take all of these
[1:33:58.020 --> 1:34:00.020]  delegate positions in the upcoming conventions.
[1:34:00.020 --> 1:34:02.020]  And then they're going to bulk
[1:34:02.020 --> 1:34:04.020]  and say, because of conscience, I will
[1:34:04.020 --> 1:34:06.020]  not dominate him. Right. They already tried it
[1:34:06.020 --> 1:34:08.020]  last time. You told me they would. I didn't
[1:34:08.020 --> 1:34:10.020]  believe it. It happened. So they're going to do it now.
[1:34:10.020 --> 1:34:12.020]  Well, they've got that opportunity.
[1:34:12.020 --> 1:34:14.020]  So what is what does Trump do? Well, it's
[1:34:14.020 --> 1:34:16.020]  not what Trump does. It's what we
[1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:18.020]  do. It's what we do.
[1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:20.020]  The info warriors showed up, I believe
[1:34:20.020 --> 1:34:22.020]  in about a 50%
[1:34:22.020 --> 1:34:24.020]  minority
[1:34:24.020 --> 1:34:26.020]  majority faction. They were right. Probably
[1:34:26.020 --> 1:34:28.020]  we were the Democrats admit this in Rolling Stone
[1:34:28.020 --> 1:34:30.020]  in AP. They hate us because I'm just
[1:34:30.020 --> 1:34:32.020]  the half the t-shirts outside or wearing info
[1:34:32.020 --> 1:34:34.020]  wars at the RNC. They know that we were the
[1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:36.020]  group over the top that actually carried
[1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:38.020]  and came and got the delegate positions. Right.
[1:34:38.020 --> 1:34:40.020]  The reason Trump got in right in 2016.
[1:34:40.020 --> 1:34:42.020]  That's not me. That's the listeners
[1:34:42.020 --> 1:34:44.020]  that took action. It's the listeners.
[1:34:44.020 --> 1:34:46.020]  That's why it's important that it's about them.
[1:34:46.020 --> 1:34:48.020]  It's about the listeners. Absolutely.
[1:34:48.020 --> 1:34:50.020]  That's the question. I knew you were going to say it's not about Trump. It's about us.
[1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:52.020]  This is about the listeners. This is about
[1:34:52.020 --> 1:34:54.020]  the listeners. It's not just about telling them
[1:34:54.020 --> 1:34:56.020]  they're important. They're everything. Right.
[1:34:56.020 --> 1:34:58.020]  Right. It's like we can't go canoeing
[1:34:58.020 --> 1:35:00.020]  if they're in water. You're the damn lake.
[1:35:00.020 --> 1:35:02.020]  You're it. Yep.
[1:35:02.020 --> 1:35:04.020]  You're the whole enchilada, baby.
[1:35:04.020 --> 1:35:06.020]  That's why it's obscene to
[1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:08.020]  think me. I'm just one more drop in
[1:35:08.020 --> 1:35:10.020]  the river, baby. You guys are
[1:35:10.020 --> 1:35:12.020]  it. If you don't show up to these upcoming
[1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:14.020]  conventions in your county, states,
[1:35:14.020 --> 1:35:16.020]  district, wherever you're located, from
[1:35:16.020 --> 1:35:18.020]  coast to coast, this is a nationwide
[1:35:18.020 --> 1:35:20.020]  thing. The territories
[1:35:20.020 --> 1:35:22.020]  show up at the territories. Info warriors,
[1:35:22.020 --> 1:35:24.020]  you need to call your county
[1:35:24.020 --> 1:35:26.020]  GOP chairman
[1:35:26.020 --> 1:35:28.020]  and ask him if you're not involved in the
[1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:30.020]  convention process already. You need to ask him
[1:35:30.020 --> 1:35:32.020]  how do I get involved and don't take no for an
[1:35:32.020 --> 1:35:34.020]  answer. Tell them you love Ronald Reagan.
[1:35:34.020 --> 1:35:36.020]  You like George Bush.
[1:35:36.020 --> 1:35:38.020]  You like, you know,
[1:35:38.020 --> 1:35:40.020]  I mean, look, we're in a war. Tell them you love
[1:35:40.020 --> 1:35:42.020]  me and hate Trump. They'll push you right
[1:35:42.020 --> 1:35:44.020]  the top. Well, find out if they're a pro. I
[1:35:44.020 --> 1:35:46.020]  never used to. We shouldn't lie, but my god,
[1:35:46.020 --> 1:35:48.020]  this is a war. I mean, and it's all I'm
[1:35:48.020 --> 1:35:50.020]  telling you is if it's a pro-Trump guy, be
[1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:52.020]  honest with him, but I wouldn't be overly
[1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:54.020]  how you hate Mitt Romney, how you hate
[1:35:54.020 --> 1:35:56.020]  Hillary. Just say, I really want Hillary
[1:35:56.020 --> 1:35:58.020]  to win and they'll put you right at the top.
[1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:00.020]  Well, I would be very cautious about that
[1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:02.020]  because they genuinely do not like
[1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:04.020]  Hillary, but anyway, I got you.
[1:36:04.020 --> 1:36:06.020]  I got you. I got you. Anyway, just
[1:36:06.020 --> 1:36:08.020]  hey, take, you know,
[1:36:08.020 --> 1:36:10.020]  be contemplative about your approach. How
[1:36:10.020 --> 1:36:12.020]  about that? And then go after him.
[1:36:12.020 --> 1:36:14.020]  Call him up. Email. Don't take no for
[1:36:14.020 --> 1:36:16.020]  an answer. Find other precinct chairs
[1:36:16.020 --> 1:36:18.020]  in your county to meet
[1:36:18.020 --> 1:36:20.020]  with and discuss with and they'll help
[1:36:20.020 --> 1:36:22.020]  mentor you. Bottom line is
[1:36:22.020 --> 1:36:24.020]  we need a majority. We need
[1:36:24.020 --> 1:36:26.020]  50, 60, 70 percent
[1:36:26.020 --> 1:36:28.020]  majority info warriors
[1:36:28.020 --> 1:36:30.020]  at the RNC.
[1:36:30.020 --> 1:36:32.020]  Let's talk about the logistics of that because
[1:36:32.020 --> 1:36:34.020]  this is how you win wars, folks. It's boots on the ground.
[1:36:34.020 --> 1:36:36.020]  It's in the guts. It's in the machinery. It's
[1:36:36.020 --> 1:36:38.020]  not all sexy unless you think
[1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:40.020]  defeat is sexy. You know, it's super sexy
[1:36:40.020 --> 1:36:42.020]  doesn't look sexy, but once you get
[1:36:42.020 --> 1:36:44.020]  in between the sheets here, it's Meryl Monroe, baby.
[1:36:48.020 --> 1:36:50.020]  I'm always excited about info wars life products.
[1:36:50.020 --> 1:36:52.020]  They're amazing. They're cutting edge. You love them. I love
[1:36:52.020 --> 1:36:54.020]  them. And they found the info war in the
[1:36:54.020 --> 1:36:56.020]  face of the globalist onslaught.
[1:36:56.020 --> 1:36:58.020]  But we have come up with a new product
[1:36:58.020 --> 1:37:00.020]  over a year in development
[1:37:00.020 --> 1:37:02.020]  that is amazing.
[1:37:02.020 --> 1:37:04.020]  The only organic
[1:37:04.020 --> 1:37:06.020]  hand sanitizer
[1:37:06.020 --> 1:37:08.020]  on the market with organic
[1:37:08.020 --> 1:37:10.020]  essential oils on top of it
[1:37:10.020 --> 1:37:12.020]  and there's another innovation
[1:37:12.020 --> 1:37:14.020]  it's the spray
[1:37:14.020 --> 1:37:16.020]  cap. It doesn't just pour out
[1:37:16.020 --> 1:37:18.020]  a bunch of thick, gross
[1:37:18.020 --> 1:37:20.020]  goo, but it's high quality
[1:37:20.020 --> 1:37:22.020]  and aerosolizes it in a really
[1:37:22.020 --> 1:37:24.020]  great way. I like to put it on my hands
[1:37:24.020 --> 1:37:26.020]  rub a little bit on my face. It's got
[1:37:26.020 --> 1:37:28.020]  organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your
[1:37:28.020 --> 1:37:30.020]  eyes. But I just love it
[1:37:30.020 --> 1:37:32.020]  personally as something that's a moisturizer
[1:37:32.020 --> 1:37:34.020]  as well. So this is
[1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:36.020]  a real innovation. I don't know why others
[1:37:36.020 --> 1:37:38.020]  think of coming out with a hand sanitizer
[1:37:38.020 --> 1:37:40.020]  that actually has essential oil in it
[1:37:40.020 --> 1:37:42.020]  so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[1:37:42.020 --> 1:37:44.020]  It's so refreshing.
[1:37:44.020 --> 1:38:04.020]  This is a big winner.
[1:38:14.020 --> 1:38:16.020]  Thank you so much for watching.
[1:38:16.020 --> 1:38:18.020]  I hope you enjoyed this video.
[1:38:18.020 --> 1:38:46.020]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[1:38:48.020 --> 1:38:50.020]  Globalists have gotten away
[1:38:50.020 --> 1:38:52.020]  with their Russiagate hoax
[1:38:52.020 --> 1:38:54.020]  their Ukraine hoax, their
[1:38:54.020 --> 1:38:56.020]  COVID-19 hoax, and now
[1:38:56.020 --> 1:38:58.020]  it's the
[1:38:58.020 --> 1:39:00.020]  race riot hoax
[1:39:00.020 --> 1:39:02.020]  of 2020.
[1:39:02.020 --> 1:39:04.020]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next
[1:39:04.020 --> 1:39:06.020]  what I can tell you. It's going to be a
[1:39:06.020 --> 1:39:08.020]  bunch of big old fat mass
[1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:10.020]  shootings to create even a
[1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:12.020]  bigger race war.
[1:39:12.020 --> 1:39:14.020]  It's going to be an economic collapse
[1:39:14.020 --> 1:39:16.020]  show.
[1:39:16.020 --> 1:39:18.020]  China invading Taiwan,
[1:39:18.020 --> 1:39:20.020]  Hong Kong,
[1:39:20.020 --> 1:39:22.020]  you name it, the globalists
[1:39:22.020 --> 1:39:24.020]  are attacking on every front.
[1:39:24.020 --> 1:39:26.020]  That's why now more than ever
[1:39:26.020 --> 1:39:28.020]  we have to realize they tried to censor
[1:39:28.020 --> 1:39:30.020]  inforwars off the air because they knew
[1:39:30.020 --> 1:39:32.020]  when they launched this whole
[1:39:32.020 --> 1:39:34.020]  situation that they didn't want the
[1:39:34.020 --> 1:39:36.020]  people's voice to still be on air.
[1:39:36.020 --> 1:39:38.020]  But thanks to you and our crew
[1:39:38.020 --> 1:39:40.020]  we are still on air.
[1:39:40.020 --> 1:39:42.020]  So let's boost that transmission like
[1:39:42.020 --> 1:39:44.020]  the Batman signal now more than ever
[1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:46.020]  inforwars.com
[1:39:46.020 --> 1:40:14.020]  Live.
[1:40:14.020 --> 1:40:16.020]  We are Hispanics, Cubans,
[1:40:16.020 --> 1:40:18.020]  Puerto Ricans.
[1:40:18.020 --> 1:40:20.020]  We used to be on Monster
[1:40:20.020 --> 1:40:22.020]  and Red Bull and Rolla
[1:40:22.020 --> 1:40:24.020]  and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking
[1:40:24.020 --> 1:40:26.020]  all that sugar and I just want to thank you for that man.
[1:40:26.020 --> 1:40:28.020]  Well brother, we put more in this
[1:40:28.020 --> 1:40:30.020]  than any other long-term high quality
[1:40:30.020 --> 1:40:32.020]  energy powder there is.
[1:40:32.020 --> 1:40:34.020]  So this was designed on one of the top guys
[1:40:34.020 --> 1:40:36.020]  in the country, he didn't want his name on it because
[1:40:36.020 --> 1:40:38.020]  obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money
[1:40:38.020 --> 1:40:40.020]  for this formulation just for the design of it. And we believe
[1:40:40.020 --> 1:40:42.020]  it is the best, strongest, but
[1:40:42.020 --> 1:40:44.020]  the best energy out there and
[1:40:44.020 --> 1:40:46.020]  you're saying that it's made your life better so that means a lot to me.
[1:40:46.020 --> 1:40:48.020]  Thank you. To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[1:40:52.020 --> 1:40:54.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:40:54.020 --> 1:40:56.020]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[1:40:56.020 --> 1:40:58.020]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[1:40:58.020 --> 1:41:00.020]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:41:00.020 --> 1:41:02.020]  It is Wednesday, June 10th, 2020
[1:41:02.020 --> 1:41:04.020]  and Richard Reeves is dead on
[1:41:04.020 --> 1:41:06.020]  when it comes to politics.
[1:41:06.020 --> 1:41:08.020]  And with the many years that you've been
[1:41:08.020 --> 1:41:10.020]  in the past, I'm sure you've got a lot of
[1:41:10.020 --> 1:41:12.020]  people who have been watching this show.
[1:41:12.020 --> 1:41:14.020]  I'm sure you've got a lot of people who have been
[1:41:14.020 --> 1:41:16.020]  watching this show.
[1:41:16.020 --> 1:41:18.020]  I'm sure that you've got a lot of people
[1:41:18.020 --> 1:41:20.020]  who have been watching this show.
[1:41:20.020 --> 1:41:22.020]  I'm sure you've got a lot of people who have been watching this show.
[1:41:22.020 --> 1:41:24.020]  I'm sure you're going to have a lot of people who
[1:41:24.020 --> 1:41:26.020]  are watching this show.
[1:41:34.020 --> 1:41:36.020]  I'm sure you've got a lot of people who are watching this show.
[1:41:44.020 --> 1:41:46.020]  Manifold.
[1:41:46.020 --> 1:41:48.020]  Let's talk about it one day.
[1:41:48.020 --> 1:41:50.020]  Of course he's concerned about that.
[1:41:50.020 --> 1:41:52.720]  time to make sure a lot of our t-shirts got out there.
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:55.620]  We sold our t-shirts at cost.
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:41:58.820]  We sold the Hillary for prison shirts for $5.
[1:41:58.820 --> 1:41:59.820]  That's what they cost us.
[1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:04.720]  The xxxx ones are like $6, but that and then some of the small ones are
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:07.120]  like three and a half dollars, but on average are $5 a piece.
[1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:08.620]  We've got a lot of designer shirts.
[1:42:08.620 --> 1:42:10.420]  Some of them cost us $15 a piece.
[1:42:10.620 --> 1:42:11.620]  A lot of them are about 12.
[1:42:11.620 --> 1:42:14.220]  They have the real soft, nice fabric, you know, made in America.
[1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:15.120]  That costs more.
[1:42:15.420 --> 1:42:17.020]  So we've got a lot of stuff made in America as well.
[1:42:17.020 --> 1:42:17.620]  It's your choice.
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:18.920]  Other stuff made in Latin America.
[1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:22.120]  We avoid the Chinese stuff at all cost.
[1:42:23.220 --> 1:42:25.220]  There are a lot of toxic dyes and stuff from there, obviously, and
[1:42:25.220 --> 1:42:28.720]  it doesn't help the people, but all t-shirts are $9.95.
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:30.820]  And on average, that is cost.
[1:42:31.220 --> 1:42:32.420]  Some shirts cost us $5.
[1:42:32.420 --> 1:42:36.520]  Some shirts cost us $15, but $9.95 is the dead reckoning average.
[1:42:37.820 --> 1:42:40.120]  Some shirts we only got a few hundred of, some we got a few thousand of.
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:42.820]  infowarstore.com.
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:44.420]  Go to the t-shirts.
[1:42:44.420 --> 1:42:49.520]  Whether it's an info war shirt, a space force shirt, a 5g kill shirt, a
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:51.720]  mass murderers agree, gun control work shirt.
[1:42:53.020 --> 1:42:56.020]  We are going to sell out of everything.
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:42:58.020]  And I think it'll only take a few weeks to do this.
[1:42:58.020 --> 1:42:59.520]  People really responded last time.
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:02.520]  And at the RNC and DNC, there was a sea of info war shirts.
[1:43:02.820 --> 1:43:06.320]  So get them at cost at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:06.820 --> 1:43:09.220]  I would say it supports the broadcast, but really just supports the truth
[1:43:09.220 --> 1:43:12.620]  because we're not making money off that, but it does trigger leftist who
[1:43:12.620 --> 1:43:15.720]  think they control the universe and who love to censor when I'm out riding
[1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:18.620]  around in Austin and the armored vehicle on the left is for throwing
[1:43:18.620 --> 1:43:21.520]  bottles and metal poles that is attacking us with hammers.
[1:43:22.620 --> 1:43:26.520]  They go, you're off Twitter at face, but they just celebrated, but they're
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:30.620]  so pissed that we've still got info wars.com and all these radio
[1:43:30.620 --> 1:43:31.820]  stations that are so precious.
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:34.620]  So please support those local radio stations as well and don't take it
[1:43:34.620 --> 1:43:37.820]  for granted the position that you've built, what we've got here in this fight.
[1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:43.820]  Also, survival shield X2 deep earth crystal iodine is now available
[1:43:43.820 --> 1:43:47.820]  in a spray bottle and it's a new formulation that some of the experts
[1:43:47.820 --> 1:43:50.820]  thinks even better delivery in the solution it's in.
[1:43:51.320 --> 1:43:54.820]  Learn about the delivery system and infowarstore.com.
[1:43:54.820 --> 1:43:56.820]  We're about to sell out of the regular X2.
[1:43:56.820 --> 1:44:03.820]  This is in and it is 1995, 33% off and that supports the broadcast as well
[1:44:03.820 --> 1:44:06.820]  and high quality swarble foods are available now more than ever.
[1:44:06.820 --> 1:44:07.820]  You need them.
[1:44:07.820 --> 1:44:09.820]  They last 25 years for all the uncertainty.
[1:44:09.820 --> 1:44:12.820]  Have that checkbox checked and support the broadcast.
[1:44:12.820 --> 1:44:15.820]  Now four weeks on average for delivery.
[1:44:15.820 --> 1:44:19.820]  It's really like three weeks, but they said say four weeks, but they've
[1:44:19.820 --> 1:44:21.820]  gotten caught up four factories in the U.S.
[1:44:21.820 --> 1:44:22.820]  High quality.
[1:44:22.820 --> 1:44:25.820]  You need to have swarble food with the economy and the globalist and all
[1:44:25.820 --> 1:44:26.820]  the rest of things that are happening.
[1:44:26.820 --> 1:44:27.820]  You need to be self-sufficient.
[1:44:27.820 --> 1:44:28.820]  That's a great way to do it.
[1:44:28.820 --> 1:44:29.820]  So infowarstore.com.
[1:44:29.820 --> 1:44:32.820]  All right, Richard Reeves and former info wars reporter, good friend
[1:44:32.820 --> 1:44:37.820]  of mine of, I don't know, like 19 years now, just get to the facts.
[1:44:37.820 --> 1:44:40.820]  What they're saying they're going to do, what the neocons are going to try,
[1:44:40.820 --> 1:44:45.820]  what the never Trumpers are going to do ahead of the RNC and what the people
[1:44:45.820 --> 1:44:48.820]  can do right now to ensure that they can't steal the nomination.
[1:44:48.820 --> 1:44:50.820]  Well, it's pretty simple.
[1:44:50.820 --> 1:44:54.820]  The people that are out there, they're still in the old Mitt Romney Bush
[1:44:54.820 --> 1:44:58.820]  McCain wing are going to try to attempt to flood all of these conventions
[1:44:58.820 --> 1:45:02.820]  upcoming, the censor of district conventions, state conventions, ultimately
[1:45:02.820 --> 1:45:04.820]  get themselves to the RNC.
[1:45:04.820 --> 1:45:11.820]  And if they can get a majority faction of McCain Bush Romney delegates at the
[1:45:11.820 --> 1:45:16.820]  RNC, there is a good possibility that they will overthrow that nomination
[1:45:16.820 --> 1:45:18.820]  of Trump and they will try it in somebody else.
[1:45:18.820 --> 1:45:22.820]  And one of the big red flag warnings was, as you know, earlier in this
[1:45:22.820 --> 1:45:26.820]  interview, you were showing that interview where you had Colin Powell
[1:45:26.820 --> 1:45:30.820]  being interviewed by Jake, the snake tapper on state of the union.
[1:45:30.820 --> 1:45:34.820]  And I happened to hear the audio of that on that program this past Sunday.
[1:45:34.820 --> 1:45:39.820]  And one of the clues was his tapper reminds us all, oh, by the way,
[1:45:39.820 --> 1:45:43.820]  you came in third in the 2016 president presidential election.
[1:45:43.820 --> 1:45:45.820]  Alex, did you know Colin Powell came in third?
[1:45:45.820 --> 1:45:50.820]  Actually, in the electoral college, he had three Republican electors switch
[1:45:50.820 --> 1:45:51.820]  to Colin Powell.
[1:45:51.820 --> 1:45:55.820]  So he actually, that was Nancy Pelosi's daughter that was on showing that.
[1:45:55.820 --> 1:45:56.820]  It was, yeah.
[1:45:56.820 --> 1:45:58.820]  And so, I mean, there, there you are.
[1:45:58.820 --> 1:46:00.820]  So you have a lot of troublemakers all over.
[1:46:00.820 --> 1:46:02.820]  We got to be a little bit concerned about the Republican.
[1:46:02.820 --> 1:46:07.820]  Ryan's previous was the Republican national chairman at the 2016.
[1:46:07.820 --> 1:46:12.820]  Right now, I still, still believe that the latest related to Mitt Romney,
[1:46:12.820 --> 1:46:13.820]  Ronan McDaniel.
[1:46:13.820 --> 1:46:15.820]  I think she's related to Mitt Romney.
[1:46:15.820 --> 1:46:16.820]  That's right.
[1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:17.820]  So they've got all their little people in place.
[1:46:17.820 --> 1:46:18.820]  Potentially, yeah.
[1:46:18.820 --> 1:46:19.820]  Potentially she can overturn.
[1:46:19.820 --> 1:46:21.820]  Oh, they're going to take a shot at the president because they never
[1:46:21.820 --> 1:46:22.820]  get held accountable.
[1:46:22.820 --> 1:46:24.820]  And she can't do it by herself though, because it's those delegates.
[1:46:24.820 --> 1:46:25.820]  They got to count the delegates.
[1:46:25.820 --> 1:46:27.820]  They got to deal with the delegates.
[1:46:27.820 --> 1:46:28.820]  We, we need delegates.
[1:46:28.820 --> 1:46:30.820]  We need info warriors that no, that's why they tried to sell.
[1:46:30.820 --> 1:46:32.820]  Oh, no one can be, that'll be virtual.
[1:46:32.820 --> 1:46:34.820]  That would be easier to steal.
[1:46:34.820 --> 1:46:35.820]  Explain that.
[1:46:35.820 --> 1:46:36.820]  Right.
[1:46:36.820 --> 1:46:37.820]  Well, well, then that's just it.
[1:46:37.820 --> 1:46:40.820]  Who, who the heck knows who's even in attendance there when it's all virtual?
[1:46:40.820 --> 1:46:44.820]  I mean, the, you know, they, they can now, you don't hear the real yay or nay.
[1:46:44.820 --> 1:46:45.820]  You don't hear the up or down.
[1:46:45.820 --> 1:46:46.820]  Right.
[1:46:46.820 --> 1:46:47.820]  Right.
[1:46:47.820 --> 1:46:49.820]  And even then electronically, you could be hitting, you know, the yes button
[1:46:49.820 --> 1:46:53.820]  or the no button and then translates, you know, via the magic of the internet.
[1:46:53.820 --> 1:46:58.820]  So how does somebody listening in Dallas or listening in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
[1:46:58.820 --> 1:47:01.820]  listening in Buffalo, New York or Jacksonville, Florida?
[1:47:01.820 --> 1:47:03.820]  What do they do?
[1:47:03.820 --> 1:47:04.820]  Okay.
[1:47:04.820 --> 1:47:05.820]  It's very simple.
[1:47:05.820 --> 1:47:10.820]  Get on the internet and search for the GOP parties, internet presence, website,
[1:47:10.820 --> 1:47:12.820]  et cetera on in your county.
[1:47:12.820 --> 1:47:15.820]  It has to be in your county, wherever you're located.
[1:47:15.820 --> 1:47:17.820]  Some places have parishes like Louisiana.
[1:47:17.820 --> 1:47:20.820]  And let's be clear, even if you're in a totally blue state, it doesn't matter
[1:47:20.820 --> 1:47:21.820]  because this is, this is about the primary.
[1:47:21.820 --> 1:47:23.820]  You need to be more involved in the blue areas, right?
[1:47:23.820 --> 1:47:25.820]  Because that's where they really run the scams.
[1:47:25.820 --> 1:47:27.820]  Well, the Democrats have their own problems.
[1:47:27.820 --> 1:47:28.820]  Okay.
[1:47:28.820 --> 1:47:32.820]  Regardless of it's blue, there's always a Republican party pretty much in every county.
[1:47:32.820 --> 1:47:34.820]  There's always a Democrat party in every county.
[1:47:34.820 --> 1:47:36.820]  But I interrupt and go back to how they do it because it's easy.
[1:47:36.820 --> 1:47:37.820]  Just go do it folks.
[1:47:37.820 --> 1:47:38.820]  Right.
[1:47:38.820 --> 1:47:39.820]  Right.
[1:47:39.820 --> 1:47:45.820]  Find your GOP parties, website, Facebook, et cetera, contact the chairman of that county
[1:47:45.820 --> 1:47:50.820]  or parish or district that's covers your area where you live.
[1:47:50.820 --> 1:47:51.820]  Simple as that.
[1:47:51.820 --> 1:47:56.820]  You've got to contact that GOP chairman and you got to ask him, how can I be involved
[1:47:56.820 --> 1:47:59.820]  in all of the upcoming convention process?
[1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:05.820]  Even if you didn't vote in the primary, for instance, in Texas, you can still participate
[1:48:05.820 --> 1:48:12.820]  in the Republican conventions if you do an oath of allegiance, basically an oath of affiliation.
[1:48:12.820 --> 1:48:14.820]  You can't participate in the libertarian party stuff.
[1:48:14.820 --> 1:48:16.820]  You can't participate in the Democrat stuff.
[1:48:16.820 --> 1:48:21.820]  You can only participate in the Republican party side of the convention process.
[1:48:21.820 --> 1:48:23.820]  Then they're not going to allow you otherwise.
[1:48:23.820 --> 1:48:27.820]  But anyway, even if you didn't vote in the primary, you're still eligible if you've not
[1:48:27.820 --> 1:48:28.820]  violated those rules.
[1:48:28.820 --> 1:48:31.820]  And again, this is where the rubber meets the road.
[1:48:31.820 --> 1:48:32.820]  Right.
[1:48:32.820 --> 1:48:35.820]  This is like where the farmers are cutting down the corn and you later eat it, you know,
[1:48:35.820 --> 1:48:37.820]  at the restaurant or at home.
[1:48:37.820 --> 1:48:39.820]  This is where the works getting done.
[1:48:39.820 --> 1:48:40.820]  Right.
[1:48:40.820 --> 1:48:41.820]  This is where the works getting done.
[1:48:41.820 --> 1:48:42.820]  This is where the sauce is being made.
[1:48:42.820 --> 1:48:45.820]  You know, whatever cliche you want to come up with, but it's so vital.
[1:48:45.820 --> 1:48:47.820]  It's not sexy.
[1:48:47.820 --> 1:48:48.820]  It's not exciting.
[1:48:48.820 --> 1:48:53.820]  It's not except victory is really, but hey, yeah, do we want to get our country back?
[1:48:53.820 --> 1:48:54.820]  That's where the excitement lies.
[1:48:54.820 --> 1:48:59.820]  So each info warrior, I think, you know, you just need to take it on like a part time gig
[1:48:59.820 --> 1:49:03.820]  where you, you do six or eight hours a week, 10 hours a week.
[1:49:03.820 --> 1:49:07.820]  All these patriots who are great people like once the UN takes over, I'll just shoot them.
[1:49:07.820 --> 1:49:10.820]  This is the UN just took over with COVID-19.
[1:49:10.820 --> 1:49:11.820]  We got all the UN documents.
[1:49:11.820 --> 1:49:14.820]  I'm going to cover it next hour with special guests.
[1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:18.820]  Look, we don't want a shooting war, but believe me, if you're not going to go knock on doors
[1:49:18.820 --> 1:49:21.820]  and if you're not going to go down to precincts and if you're not going to go watch these
[1:49:21.820 --> 1:49:25.820]  politicos and get involved, you're never going to get in a war if we lose.
[1:49:25.820 --> 1:49:26.820]  We don't want to lose.
[1:49:26.820 --> 1:49:27.820]  We don't want to war.
[1:49:27.820 --> 1:49:31.820]  Yeah, we'll win a physical war and I'm ready to participate in one if I have to.
[1:49:31.820 --> 1:49:32.820]  But let's not go there.
[1:49:32.820 --> 1:49:37.820]  If it gets to a shooting war, we lost and what breaks my heart is knowing that Alex,
[1:49:37.820 --> 1:49:38.820]  we have the numbers.
[1:49:38.820 --> 1:49:42.820]  I'll tell you what, to be honest with you, we have the numbers out there in the info
[1:49:42.820 --> 1:49:46.820]  warriors to not only take over the Republican party, lock, stock and barrel.
[1:49:46.820 --> 1:49:47.820]  We have those numbers.
[1:49:47.820 --> 1:49:51.820]  If they all knew what to do and what action to take, we could have the Republican party
[1:49:51.820 --> 1:49:52.820]  and the Democrat party.
[1:49:52.820 --> 1:49:57.820]  If you want to get rid of election fraud, we control both sides of the ballot then both
[1:49:57.820 --> 1:50:01.820]  sides of the ballot could be under our control because all of these scoundrels that one run
[1:50:01.820 --> 1:50:04.820]  one run for office, they come to the executive.
[1:50:04.820 --> 1:50:05.820]  That's another point.
[1:50:05.820 --> 1:50:06.820]  The Democrats can have a revival.
[1:50:06.820 --> 1:50:07.820]  It could be taken over.
[1:50:07.820 --> 1:50:08.820]  Exactly.
[1:50:08.820 --> 1:50:09.820]  Yeah.
[1:50:09.820 --> 1:50:12.820]  If you have great enough numbers can take over the Democrat party too.
[1:50:12.820 --> 1:50:15.820]  And by the way, Bernie bros, you should get involved in your convention process.
[1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:19.820]  Otherwise you're probably going to end up with Hillary as your candidate on the Democrat
[1:50:19.820 --> 1:50:20.820]  side.
[1:50:20.820 --> 1:50:21.820]  They're now admittedly planning that.
[1:50:21.820 --> 1:50:22.820]  Yeah.
[1:50:22.820 --> 1:50:23.820]  So we're going to have to watch for that.
[1:50:23.820 --> 1:50:24.820]  That's just it.
[1:50:24.820 --> 1:50:26.820]  The new people say, why would they run a corpse?
[1:50:26.820 --> 1:50:29.820]  She looks, that's, she looks healthy compared to Biden.
[1:50:29.820 --> 1:50:30.820]  Yeah.
[1:50:30.820 --> 1:50:31.820]  Yeah.
[1:50:31.820 --> 1:50:33.820]  And actually is able to make a little bit more sense than Biden, not much more, but
[1:50:33.820 --> 1:50:34.820]  some more.
[1:50:34.820 --> 1:50:35.820]  Yeah.
[1:50:35.820 --> 1:50:37.820]  So that's the scary thing is, okay, what are we going to see on the Democrat side?
[1:50:37.820 --> 1:50:39.820]  So how do you make a corpse look good?
[1:50:39.820 --> 1:50:41.820]  We'll put a more rotten one up there.
[1:50:41.820 --> 1:50:42.820]  Yeah.
[1:50:42.820 --> 1:50:43.820]  Well, maybe that's it.
[1:50:43.820 --> 1:50:45.820]  You know, Matt Drudge long ago, he said, you know, pretty soon we're going to have
[1:50:45.820 --> 1:50:46.820]  a head in the jar.
[1:50:46.820 --> 1:50:47.820]  Right.
[1:50:47.820 --> 1:50:48.820]  So, you know, maybe that's Hillary or Biden.
[1:50:48.820 --> 1:50:49.820]  I don't know.
[1:50:49.820 --> 1:50:51.820]  He's more head in the jar than Hillary was brain in the jar.
[1:50:51.820 --> 1:50:52.820]  Yeah.
[1:50:52.820 --> 1:50:53.820]  Yeah.
[1:50:53.820 --> 1:50:54.820]  Brain in the jar.
[1:50:54.820 --> 1:50:56.820]  It's like that old Saturday Night Live deal where Michael Corleone, Godfather five or
[1:50:56.820 --> 1:50:57.820]  whatever, they won't let him.
[1:50:57.820 --> 1:50:59.820]  They won't let me quit the brains in a jar.
[1:50:59.820 --> 1:51:00.820]  Look, look at her.
[1:51:00.820 --> 1:51:01.820]  This is, this is what we're up.
[1:51:01.820 --> 1:51:02.820]  We can't beat.
[1:51:02.820 --> 1:51:06.820]  It's like a revelation says after Satan's caged, people say this is who did all this.
[1:51:06.820 --> 1:51:07.820]  I mean, that's pretty pathetic.
[1:51:07.820 --> 1:51:10.820]  Well, the question is, has she hit her knees and her belly yet?
[1:51:10.820 --> 1:51:11.820]  I don't know.
[1:51:11.820 --> 1:51:12.820]  Has that happened yet?
[1:51:12.820 --> 1:51:13.820]  And what about Pelosi?
[1:51:13.820 --> 1:51:14.820]  You know, at least one.
[1:51:14.820 --> 1:51:16.820]  She's the one that got the law passed calling black men superpreters.
[1:51:16.820 --> 1:51:17.820]  Yeah.
[1:51:17.820 --> 1:51:18.820]  Well, and Hillary helped on that.
[1:51:18.820 --> 1:51:19.820]  Right.
[1:51:19.820 --> 1:51:22.460]  So, but you know, that one police chief set that new standard.
[1:51:22.460 --> 1:51:23.820]  You got to not just get on your knees.
[1:51:23.820 --> 1:51:24.820]  You got to get on your belly.
[1:51:24.820 --> 1:51:25.820]  Like a snake.
[1:51:25.820 --> 1:51:26.820]  Yeah.
[1:51:26.820 --> 1:51:30.820]  So we want to see all these Democrat leaders not on your knees, not sufficient.
[1:51:30.820 --> 1:51:33.820]  I wanted to show that I want them to all the blood and brains out.
[1:51:33.820 --> 1:51:34.820]  I'm not going to do it.
[1:51:34.820 --> 1:51:36.820]  I'm not going to do it.
[1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:42.820]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[1:51:42.820 --> 1:51:47.820]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.

[1:54:03.820 --> 1:54:29.820]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:54:29.820 --> 1:54:35.820]  I want their ideas to be destroyed, but bowing, lying down their stomachs isn't enough.
[1:54:35.820 --> 1:54:39.820]  When does it get to the point, Richard, where we're asked for human sacrifice to atone for
[1:54:39.820 --> 1:54:40.820]  how we're bad?
[1:54:40.820 --> 1:54:42.820]  I mean, once you're on your knees, what else do you do?
[1:54:42.820 --> 1:54:43.820]  Actually, we're there.
[1:54:43.820 --> 1:54:49.820]  You described actually on one of your shows recently that these vaccine programs are a form of human
[1:54:49.820 --> 1:54:50.820]  sacrifice.
[1:54:50.820 --> 1:54:51.820]  So we're there.
[1:54:51.820 --> 1:54:54.820]  Of course, I wasn't really going to eat my neighbors, but you were saying during the break,
[1:54:54.820 --> 1:54:56.820]  especially eating us.
[1:54:56.820 --> 1:54:59.820]  I'll tell you what, they are eating us.
[1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:03.820]  And if we fail, InfoWars, if we fail, there's no hiding under the radar.
[1:55:03.820 --> 1:55:05.820]  They've got this internet thing.
[1:55:05.820 --> 1:55:09.820]  They got us all figured out even if you don't have internet or smartphone or whatever, you're
[1:55:09.820 --> 1:55:11.820]  probably on the top of the list.
[1:55:11.820 --> 1:55:15.820]  So it's either we're going to push the New World Order back however many 100, 200 years,
[1:55:15.820 --> 1:55:17.820]  we know revelation is true.
[1:55:17.820 --> 1:55:19.820]  So sooner or later, they get their moment in the sun.
[1:55:19.820 --> 1:55:22.820]  But I think it's really up to our activities right now.
[1:55:22.820 --> 1:55:27.820]  I think God has given us the free will and the ability to push back the evil and have
[1:55:27.820 --> 1:55:28.820]  more time.
[1:55:28.820 --> 1:55:33.820]  And I think this is where Donald Trump has an unprecedented opportunity to bring the
[1:55:33.820 --> 1:55:35.820]  First Amendment to the whole planet.
[1:55:35.820 --> 1:55:37.820]  He can do it with the trade deals.
[1:55:37.820 --> 1:55:40.820]  The First Amendment, the people are clamoring for First Amendment.
[1:55:40.820 --> 1:55:42.820]  You got Hong Kong over there.
[1:55:42.820 --> 1:55:45.820]  Potentially, you know, that could be our 51st state Hong Kong.
[1:55:45.820 --> 1:55:47.820]  Those people are ready to be Americans by the way.
[1:55:47.820 --> 1:55:52.820]  The U.S. since aircraft carrier as China makes moves in the Pacific, China says they may invade
[1:55:52.820 --> 1:55:53.820]  Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[1:55:53.820 --> 1:55:54.820]  I know.
[1:55:54.820 --> 1:55:56.820]  And by the way, the Washington Post is like supporting that.
[1:55:56.820 --> 1:55:57.820]  Well, sure they are.
[1:55:57.820 --> 1:56:00.820]  The, you know, the baseless post that doesn't, it's no surprise there.
[1:56:00.820 --> 1:56:02.820]  You've got a lot of leftists supporting that.
[1:56:02.820 --> 1:56:04.820]  It's just really upside down world.
[1:56:04.820 --> 1:56:06.820]  Things have gone crazy as your audience knows.
[1:56:06.820 --> 1:56:10.820]  And we have, like I say, Donald Trump, you've got an opportunity right now.
[1:56:10.820 --> 1:56:16.820]  You know, I told you in January of 2016, Alex, I was in Iowa following the Trump campaign.
[1:56:16.820 --> 1:56:19.820]  And I told you, look, Trump's got two choices on this.
[1:56:19.820 --> 1:56:23.820]  He's either going to be the best president ever or the worst president ever.
[1:56:23.820 --> 1:56:27.820]  And right now I'm sorry, but he's tacking towards the worst side right now.
[1:56:27.820 --> 1:56:29.820]  So he really needs to take big action.
[1:56:29.820 --> 1:56:31.820]  He needs to be great.
[1:56:31.820 --> 1:56:33.820]  But now they've counter struck to kill the economy.
[1:56:33.820 --> 1:56:36.820]  He needs to be out there saying you're the ones that launched the COVID hype.
[1:56:36.820 --> 1:56:38.820]  You're the ones saying keep us locked down.
[1:56:38.820 --> 1:56:41.820]  You're the ones that say everybody should riot, but we can't have a mega rally.
[1:56:41.820 --> 1:56:42.820]  He needs to go on the offense.
[1:56:42.820 --> 1:56:43.820]  He is.
[1:56:43.820 --> 1:56:45.820]  He needs to step up and be educator in chief.
[1:56:45.820 --> 1:56:48.820]  He needs to be like Alex Jones firing off and bringing up.
[1:56:48.820 --> 1:56:50.820]  He can wake up the planet.
[1:56:50.820 --> 1:56:52.820]  He can wake up the planet out.
[1:56:52.820 --> 1:56:54.820]  Donald Trump can wake up the planet.
[1:56:54.820 --> 1:56:55.820]  Please do that.
[1:56:55.820 --> 1:56:58.820]  So right now you should be out there saying the Democrats, the party, the KKK,
[1:56:58.820 --> 1:57:02.820]  the minimum sentencing, the board, all the black babies, reading Margaret Sanger quotes,
[1:57:02.820 --> 1:57:03.820]  he could destroy them.
[1:57:03.820 --> 1:57:08.820]  Donald Trump assume the role of educator in chief.
[1:57:08.820 --> 1:57:10.820]  Assume the role of educator in chief.
[1:57:10.820 --> 1:57:12.820]  Start the rallies back up.
[1:57:12.820 --> 1:57:13.820]  He's doing that.
[1:57:13.820 --> 1:57:17.820]  But I think he knows now he's being set up with 145 days out because I told you Trump
[1:57:17.820 --> 1:57:19.820]  was going to win and he still has a chance to.
[1:57:19.820 --> 1:57:21.820]  But let me tell you, they're lined up this time.
[1:57:21.820 --> 1:57:22.820]  Yeah.
[1:57:22.820 --> 1:57:23.820]  Yep.
[1:57:23.820 --> 1:57:27.820]  They're always lined up and let, you know, do those rallies, no social distancing.
[1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:30.820]  You know, pretty much everybody should not wear a mask.
[1:57:30.820 --> 1:57:32.820]  Make it optional on the mask.
[1:57:32.820 --> 1:57:33.820]  You know, make it optional.
[1:57:33.820 --> 1:57:34.820]  And you're rundown number six.
[1:57:34.820 --> 1:57:36.820]  It's a real pneumonia.
[1:57:36.820 --> 1:57:38.820]  He was the Democrats put now learned it's 10 states.
[1:57:38.820 --> 1:57:39.820]  I was saying four or four.
[1:57:39.820 --> 1:57:41.820]  They got attention on purpose.
[1:57:41.820 --> 1:57:44.820]  COVID patients with nursing home people.
[1:57:44.820 --> 1:57:46.820]  That's a known death sentence.
[1:57:46.820 --> 1:57:47.820]  Just to get the numbers up.
[1:57:47.820 --> 1:57:49.820]  I mean, that is some evil people.
[1:57:49.820 --> 1:57:51.820]  I know that's old news, but now it's confirmed.
[1:57:51.820 --> 1:57:55.820]  They told doctors that the health department in New York threatened to arrest state board
[1:57:55.820 --> 1:57:59.820]  examiners that said, don't do this, which that brings up another source point of frustration
[1:57:59.820 --> 1:58:05.820]  for me is Trump has allowed these criminals to just continue and doing their nefarious
[1:58:05.820 --> 1:58:06.820]  activities.
[1:58:06.820 --> 1:58:10.820]  It's just like you talked about with the, the murder and scum that's putting COVID
[1:58:10.820 --> 1:58:12.820]  infecting patients and nursing homes.
[1:58:12.820 --> 1:58:18.820]  Well, I'm frustrated true cause true also because Trump has known about Antifa since
[1:58:18.820 --> 1:58:24.820]  the spring of 2016 when Antifa and other black block groups made them cancel Trump's
[1:58:24.820 --> 1:58:26.820]  Chicago event in 2016.
[1:58:26.820 --> 1:58:27.820]  It turned out with you.
[1:58:27.820 --> 1:58:30.820]  Like Hillary and Soros were behind that Richard Reeves of info wars.
[1:58:30.820 --> 1:58:31.820]  Thank you, Richard.
[1:58:31.820 --> 1:58:32.820]  Great points.
[1:58:32.820 --> 1:58:33.820]  Thanks.
[1:58:33.820 --> 1:58:34.820]  All right.
[1:58:34.820 --> 1:58:35.820]  I've been a fan of these guys for years.

[2:00:06.820 --> 2:00:09.820]  I'm not a fan of a 6 arm volunteers.
[2:00:09.820 --> 2:00:11.820]  The whole seas to ground in Seattle.
[2:00:11.820 --> 2:00:13.820]  What could go wrong?
[2:00:13.820 --> 2:00:14.820]  It's all over the land.
[2:00:14.820 --> 2:00:17.820]  It hits number one on Amazon after HBO Bands film.
[2:00:17.820 --> 2:00:22.820]  Neocon Colin Powell says he will vote for Biden and has now put out new comments.
[2:00:22.820 --> 2:00:23.820]  Check yourself, Negro.
[2:00:23.820 --> 2:00:29.820]  Cornell West explodes on Leo Turrell during handy debate about the funding police.
[2:00:29.820 --> 2:00:30.820]  I guess he's like Joe Biden.
[2:00:30.820 --> 2:00:34.820]  He's like if you don't do what I say, you're not black, you're not American, you're not
[2:00:34.820 --> 2:00:35.820]  anything.
[2:00:35.820 --> 2:00:41.860]  Absolutely insane, but you know what? I've decided before we go to our guest here the hodge twins here in just a moment
[2:00:41.860 --> 2:00:43.860]  I have decided
[2:00:44.020 --> 2:00:46.180]  To join Antifa because they're the heroes
[2:00:46.740 --> 2:00:52.460]  When you randomly just attack somebody's vehicle, so here's a little bit of footage of me joining Antifa in an initiation yesterday
[2:00:52.460 --> 2:01:09.460]  But there's a car right there. It's Hitler
[2:01:22.460 --> 2:01:30.220]  By the way, everyone's commenting that my t-shirts too small
[2:01:30.620 --> 2:01:36.520]  That's the point is I'm doing a comedy piece. All right big fans these guys for years the hodge twins
[2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:40.940]  I want to plug your website, but they want you to go their YouTube channel conservative twins gentlemen
[2:01:40.940 --> 2:01:44.820]  You need no introduction here great to have you on with us. I know you've been on some of the other shows
[2:01:44.820 --> 2:01:49.900]  But thanks for being here with us and wow, where do you want to start with what's currently happening?
[2:01:49.900 --> 2:01:52.060]  I mean, what would you call this period of time we're in right now?
[2:01:52.060 --> 2:02:06.380]  This is what caused all it is and it's all been pushed on this live that cops are hunting down black people on a daily basis
[2:02:06.380 --> 2:02:12.060]  Right, which is the biggest lie. I mean statistically speaking a majority of our encounters with police officers is good
[2:02:12.140 --> 2:02:18.220]  But this mainstream media trying to push this idea that they're hunting down black folks and kill them in in numbers
[2:02:18.220 --> 2:02:22.380]  That's not seeing you know the demographics. Yeah, please brutality is a problem
[2:02:22.380 --> 2:02:29.340]  But it happens across all walks of life not just with black people and ever since president Trump got elected
[2:02:29.340 --> 2:02:36.140]  Yeah, they were saying how divisive he is. I mean when you look at mainstream media, they're all about divisiveness
[2:02:36.140 --> 2:02:44.460]  This they have never been bringing America together and right now you unfortunately you can see how things breaking out because of identity politics
[2:02:44.460 --> 2:02:49.580]  Do you think they're successful? Where do you think this is all going?
[2:02:52.620 --> 2:02:58.620]  Man, it's these damn globalists. They're trying to western civilization. They're trying to destroy us
[2:02:59.180 --> 2:03:05.420]  Yeah, I think they're well on their way. Yeah, because you got black people thinking that they're less than human
[2:03:05.420 --> 2:03:10.940]  They're less than white people. They believe in white privilege. They believe cops out here hunting us down
[2:03:10.940 --> 2:03:18.460]  That's all a lie. Michael makes it just years ago. The media is the most powerful organization. They can make the innocent
[2:03:19.180 --> 2:03:24.140]  Look guilty and make the guilty look innocent. They did it with Trump. They doing it with the police
[2:03:24.380 --> 2:03:27.500]  Yeah, they're actually causing our society to crumble
[2:03:27.980 --> 2:03:31.660]  Yeah, and they they've uh make Joe Biden like a saint
[2:03:32.220 --> 2:03:37.580]  I mean, it's it's pretty obvious when you see this man on camera that he's not a good person
[2:03:37.580 --> 2:03:42.460]  The things that he does that how you avoid people's personal space regardless of gender
[2:03:42.700 --> 2:03:45.980]  It just makes me sick because when you look at this man
[2:03:46.860 --> 2:03:49.980]  You can tell that this man is evil. He's been in office
[2:03:50.460 --> 2:03:57.020]  For over 40 years. He's did nothing and now they're trying to preach to the american people that it's all trump's fault
[2:03:57.180 --> 2:04:01.260]  He's only been in office for three years. These people have been in office for decades
[2:04:02.380 --> 2:04:04.380]  Sick, well, I was about to say
[2:04:04.380 --> 2:04:09.340]  What trump's gotten done has been incredible and I wish he'd do more, but he's totally surrounded
[2:04:09.820 --> 2:04:16.460]  He he's massively turned the economy on massively increased funding to black colleges and all these other places actually help people
[2:04:16.700 --> 2:04:19.340]  He's he's ending wars. He said he would end
[2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:24.620]  Uh, he's getting conservative supreme court people in all I see is him fighting like hell
[2:04:24.860 --> 2:04:28.300]  To keep his promises and now the democrats said we want to plunge the economy
[2:04:28.700 --> 2:04:33.420]  And now they're like oh covet 19 that they hyped up plunge the economy and now they're blaming it on trump
[2:04:33.420 --> 2:04:37.500]  They think we're so stupid. We don't have a memory. Well, you guys have a memory
[2:04:37.740 --> 2:04:40.620]  I have a memory, but I gotta tell you a lot of americans out there
[2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:46.620]  It seemed don't have a memory and I'm really worried about trump. What do you gut level thinks about to happen in this election in 145 days?
[2:04:48.060 --> 2:04:49.580]  man
[2:04:49.580 --> 2:04:54.300]  It's really remarkable what this man has been able to accomplish since he went to office because
[2:04:54.700 --> 2:04:59.180]  then the media the government itself is after him, but
[2:04:59.180 --> 2:05:05.820]  I cannot see how this man is not reelected. Yeah, I mean everything. He's done regardless of
[2:05:06.380 --> 2:05:13.020]  Of the some of the things you said nobody's perfect, but trump has did some amazing things. Yeah, it's it's like
[2:05:13.820 --> 2:05:18.380]  Literally half this country cannot think for themselves if he loses this next election
[2:05:18.620 --> 2:05:24.300]  It's because of that because a lot of times people they turn on the tv. They don't want to form an opinion
[2:05:24.300 --> 2:05:29.340]  They they follow what the media is pushing. Yeah, and that's why this country is in a situation that it is
[2:05:29.500 --> 2:05:31.500]  People do not think for themselves anymore
[2:05:32.060 --> 2:05:34.540]  Conservatives we think for ourselves, but on the left
[2:05:35.180 --> 2:05:41.100]  They they go with whatever the media pushes and that's if he loses election. That's why he will lose
[2:05:41.100 --> 2:05:42.300]  I totally agree
[2:05:42.300 --> 2:05:49.100]  Bad harming attacks everything that they say is opinionated. They form an opinion and they they tell their audience
[2:05:49.100 --> 2:05:51.500]  What to think instead of two things? Yeah
[2:05:51.500 --> 2:05:55.500]  What do you make of CNN and MPR saying Trump's bad to have rallies again?
[2:05:55.500 --> 2:05:59.500]  But all these other big mass rallies that are anti-trump anti-america are good
[2:05:59.740 --> 2:06:04.860]  Again, they're literally talking on both sides of their mouth in front of us. It's like a war on logic
[2:06:06.620 --> 2:06:11.820]  Right there. There's no logic. Yeah, it's no logic. They told us with this COVID stay home
[2:06:11.820 --> 2:06:17.420]  Yeah, when this uh, George Floyd thing happened forget all about all that. We need to write. We need to protest
[2:06:17.420 --> 2:06:22.380]  Yeah, it's hypocrisy at its finest, but it's weird to me that half the country
[2:06:22.860 --> 2:06:25.260]  They can't they can't see that. Yeah
[2:06:25.580 --> 2:06:31.740]  Politics in this country is so probabilistic now people just stick with their side and they don't sit there
[2:06:32.060 --> 2:06:34.060]  And and continue to be objective
[2:06:34.860 --> 2:06:36.860]  I
[2:06:36.860 --> 2:06:38.860]  I agree. What do you make of
[2:06:39.420 --> 2:06:41.420]  Pelosi and them dressing up
[2:06:41.740 --> 2:06:45.900]  With with like some type of I guess Kenyan scarf, which is even Kenyan
[2:06:45.900 --> 2:06:52.060]  And then bowing and kneeling and then other people getting on their bellies. I mean quite frankly, I think this is very condescending. I think
[2:06:52.700 --> 2:06:54.700]  I think this is really patronizing. What do you think?
[2:06:55.660 --> 2:07:00.140]  But that's what they've been doing for decades Alex. They they it works
[2:07:00.380 --> 2:07:05.660]  They've been telling black people that they're not american that they're african-american
[2:07:06.140 --> 2:07:08.140]  Yeah, and black people even they don't
[2:07:08.780 --> 2:07:13.900]  They pink us as african-americans. They won't just call out and just tell us that we americans
[2:07:13.900 --> 2:07:17.580]  Tell us that we americans know we're african-americans. We're less than american
[2:07:17.820 --> 2:07:22.940]  Then when they show up in his kente cloth, it is so patronizing. It's right there in your face
[2:07:23.260 --> 2:07:28.700]  Yeah, you know and people don't see it black people don't see it black if I showed up in a native american
[2:07:29.260 --> 2:07:32.620]  funeral wearing face paint in fellas exactly
[2:07:33.260 --> 2:07:38.140]  Disrespectful, but they do it in front of I was about to say they say it's a halloween deal and I dress up
[2:07:38.140 --> 2:07:42.140]  And I'm just having fun as being a greek or indian or something that that's not meaning to be match
[2:07:42.140 --> 2:07:46.060]  What's not bad in my view, but if I showed up at a native american funeral dressed up like a big chief
[2:07:46.220 --> 2:07:49.500]  They go, hey dude, you're a little bit of a weirdo and you're acting like you're us
[2:07:49.580 --> 2:07:52.060]  You're not or showing up at a black funeral in blackface
[2:07:52.300 --> 2:07:56.700]  This is literally like when hillary would would would be in, uh, kentucky and she goes
[2:07:56.780 --> 2:08:00.380]  Hey, y'all didn't talking to like granny clamping. I mean the
[2:08:00.940 --> 2:08:05.020]  Because I mean if I was in new york, I wouldn't put on a new york accent or if I was in alabama
[2:08:05.100 --> 2:08:08.060]  I wouldn't put on a southern drawl. I don't get this fakeness
[2:08:08.060 --> 2:08:12.620]  Yeah, alc Hillary Clinton showing up with a bottle of hot sauce
[2:08:13.100 --> 2:08:18.140]  Joe Biden saying if you don't vote for me, you're not black. I mean when are black people going to wake up?
[2:08:18.220 --> 2:08:23.580]  This is so exactly I couldn't imagine showing up and say some mexican people's house and I go
[2:08:23.660 --> 2:08:27.340]  Hey, look, I got hot sauce. I mean what who the hell thinks like that?
[2:08:28.220 --> 2:08:30.460]  Hey, alex, don't forget about the sombrero hat
[2:08:31.660 --> 2:08:36.460]  Man, I tell you it's getting crazier and crazier and crazier when I show up at my friend's houses
[2:08:36.460 --> 2:08:38.620]  I only think about what color they are. I'm like, hey, where are we going to go eat?
[2:08:39.420 --> 2:08:42.860]  I mean, it's it's it's rub it again. Democrats they put everything through a lens
[2:08:43.580 --> 2:08:45.580]  Why do they do that?
[2:08:45.740 --> 2:08:49.500]  Identity politics divide and conquer. Yeah, that's the whole motto
[2:08:49.820 --> 2:08:52.860]  If if people wake up and stop looking at people
[2:08:53.260 --> 2:08:58.620]  Judging them based on the color of the skin just by the contour that character and what who's got the best ideas
[2:08:58.940 --> 2:09:02.380]  Yeah, america being a lot better position. But until that happens
[2:09:02.380 --> 2:09:08.700]  Unfortunately people of color minorities, they're going to continue to suffer. Yeah, that's why the democrats are panicking
[2:09:08.700 --> 2:09:10.060]  I don't want to talk to you guys about this when we come back
[2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:12.300]  We see the polls but I've learned not to believe those but I know
[2:09:12.780 --> 2:09:16.140]  A lot of people of every color and it does seem like with quote minorities
[2:09:16.220 --> 2:09:21.500]  Trump is very very popular compared to other republicans. Well, other republicans are super boring weirdos. I don't I don't blame them
[2:09:21.820 --> 2:09:24.700]  So so the polls show upwards of 40 percent of black males like trump
[2:09:25.020 --> 2:09:26.140]  That's up from 10 percent
[2:09:26.140 --> 2:09:31.580]  You know previously is that an accurate number from what you see just in general talking to folks when we come back in
[2:09:31.580 --> 2:09:36.860]  What other tricks does the deep state have up their sleeve try to derail trump and if trump did lose?
[2:09:37.660 --> 2:09:41.740]  What will the democrats do next? Let's talk about worst-case scenario when we come back
[2:09:46.700 --> 2:09:51.660]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I've told folks going back three months ago
[2:09:51.740 --> 2:09:55.100]  I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the covet 19 virus
[2:09:55.100 --> 2:10:00.700]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun
[2:10:00.700 --> 2:10:05.260]  It's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the united states
[2:10:05.340 --> 2:10:06.860]  And it's even worse in the third world
[2:10:06.860 --> 2:10:09.740]  So I hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it
[2:10:09.740 --> 2:10:15.900]  But with the election fraud and the covet 19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on
[2:10:16.300 --> 2:10:22.300]  Now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years. They're an easily totable bags
[2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:27.020]  It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready and it funds the info war

[2:10:46.060 --> 2:10:50.860]  Let's go to one in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Hello. Can you hear me? I sure can sir. Thank you
[2:10:51.020 --> 2:10:54.380]  Hey, Alex before I start man. I just I've been wanted to talk to you
[2:10:54.380 --> 2:10:57.740]  Bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now here, man
[2:10:57.820 --> 2:11:00.940]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you brother from New Brink, Connecticut
[2:11:00.940 --> 2:11:07.180]  And I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two before that have changed the way I drive
[2:11:07.340 --> 2:11:13.900]  Me and me and my my brothers that drive there's a couple of us. We are Hispanics Cubans Puerto Ricans
[2:11:14.300 --> 2:11:15.900]  we used to be on
[2:11:15.900 --> 2:11:22.140]  Monster and and Red Bull and Rolla and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to
[2:11:22.140 --> 2:11:27.820]  Thank you for that man. Well brother. We put more in this than any other long-term high quality energy powder
[2:11:27.820 --> 2:11:31.020]  There is so this this was designed on one of the top guys in the country
[2:11:31.020 --> 2:11:33.500]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues
[2:11:33.500 --> 2:11:36.220]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it
[2:11:36.220 --> 2:11:41.980]  And we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life better
[2:11:41.980 --> 2:11:44.620]  So that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you
[2:11:44.620 --> 2:11:50.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:12:08.700 --> 2:12:11.740]  From the front lines of the information war
[2:12:11.740 --> 2:12:17.660]  It's Alex Jones and it's the hodge twins check them out on youtube at conservative twins
[2:12:18.300 --> 2:12:20.300]  They've got almost 500,000 subscribers
[2:12:21.820 --> 2:12:26.060]  Hundreds of millions of billions of years. Look at these new articles that just went live at news wars.com
[2:12:26.620 --> 2:12:31.740]  Antifa releases list of demands after capturing six blocks of downtown Seattle
[2:12:32.300 --> 2:12:35.340]  Demands include reparations abolishing police
[2:12:37.180 --> 2:12:39.180]  Releasing violent criminals
[2:12:39.180 --> 2:12:41.180]  And rent controls
[2:12:41.740 --> 2:12:44.940]  And all it is is a globalist mom meant to destabilize the country
[2:12:45.420 --> 2:12:48.220]  I want to go back to our guests the hodge twins and ask you that question
[2:12:48.780 --> 2:12:52.060]  The unthinkable. What will democrats do if they win the election interview?
[2:12:54.300 --> 2:12:56.780]  Man, they will destroy this country that ideas
[2:12:57.420 --> 2:13:00.140]  The ideas have never worked anywhere socialism
[2:13:00.860 --> 2:13:05.420]  I mean, they will actually destroy this country. Yeah, it's just be one step closer because
[2:13:05.420 --> 2:13:10.220]  You know, you look at all great nations all great countries all the empires. They never fall
[2:13:10.860 --> 2:13:15.900]  Outside of the country. They always fall within and the democrats if they win this next election
[2:13:16.220 --> 2:13:22.540]  That's they're just one step closer destroying this country and try to remodel this country some socialist communist country that they
[2:13:22.860 --> 2:13:28.940]  That's that that's that main motive. That's what they want to do. They want to ruin western civilization. They want to ruin our
[2:13:29.660 --> 2:13:34.300]  our celebrations our holidays and they want to turn into something that's this evil and
[2:13:34.300 --> 2:13:40.140]  Corrupt and that's socialism works on paper, but in reality it doesn't work. It's never worked
[2:13:40.460 --> 2:13:43.420]  Yeah, but it works for the people that bring it in they sure get rich
[2:13:44.540 --> 2:13:51.180]  Oh, definitely. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, you have their leaders like hollywood politicians. They're doing well, but the majority of america
[2:13:51.340 --> 2:13:53.100]  They're going to suffer
[2:13:53.100 --> 2:13:55.100]  What do you make of
[2:13:55.100 --> 2:13:57.100]  I think it's trump's biggest failure
[2:13:57.340 --> 2:14:02.300]  And he says he's going to do something now, but the censorship is now over everybody everything
[2:14:02.300 --> 2:14:08.220]  All my family a lot of them. I would even call them super conservative if they just say something supporting the president
[2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:13.420]  They get blocked on twitter or facebook. They're blocking everything now. They're they're censoring the president's tweets
[2:14:14.860 --> 2:14:19.900]  Yeah, yeah, I was reading the argument yesterday. He's actually trying to bang the president of the united states
[2:14:20.540 --> 2:14:24.940]  From twitter. I mean just what you think he couldn't get any crazier. Yeah
[2:14:25.500 --> 2:14:29.900]  It just keeps getting dumber and dumber and dumber. It's like it doesn't stop
[2:14:29.900 --> 2:14:37.340]  It's because these people who are in leadership positions as democrats. They don't have any ideas. Not they're not very smart people
[2:14:37.580 --> 2:14:44.460]  Yeah, and I people on the on the left. They get voted in because they're gay or black or they're female
[2:14:44.540 --> 2:14:48.940]  They're not elected because of their ideas. It's because of their their identity
[2:14:49.340 --> 2:14:55.260]  And then the females or the black folks that are actually smart and patriots they get blocked and attacked by the left the most
[2:14:55.500 --> 2:14:59.340]  I mean, can you speak to that or maybe i'm wrong? But isn't the greatest bullying?
[2:14:59.340 --> 2:15:03.980]  Uh reserved for people that that happen to be black or a woman or whatever who are successful
[2:15:04.060 --> 2:15:06.060]  But who aren't doing what the democrats say?
[2:15:06.780 --> 2:15:12.540]  Yeah, all the racism we experience is from blacks. Yeah, we get death threats
[2:15:12.700 --> 2:15:18.700]  Yeah, just because I don't I don't agree with the leftist mob with the leftist agenda because I have strong conservative values
[2:15:19.020 --> 2:15:24.700]  I'm called racial slurs and they get a pass if a white man comes out and call a black man the n word
[2:15:24.700 --> 2:15:29.340]  They're crucified, but on the left when they do it to us conservatives. It's okay
[2:15:30.220 --> 2:15:35.740]  What we need to do is people like conservative in general. We need not we need to stop being so nice
[2:15:36.140 --> 2:15:41.580]  Yeah, we need to wake up these people are every day from the moment they wake up
[2:15:41.660 --> 2:15:45.180]  They's what they're gonna do to ruin our country people on the right
[2:15:45.260 --> 2:15:46.300]  We need to wake up
[2:15:46.300 --> 2:15:51.820]  We need to stand up and we need to do something about it or just sit back and let this country get destroyed
[2:15:51.820 --> 2:15:56.460]  By the way, you're calling them evil and corrupt. I don't I know the listeners know this
[2:15:56.460 --> 2:16:01.980]  But but even I have been in the trenches for 20-something years when I go out of these rallies now democrats didn't used to act this crazy
[2:16:01.980 --> 2:16:04.780]  You know, I'm being mean to white people, but let's just say it. It's like 90%
[2:16:05.500 --> 2:16:12.060]  Crazy wild-eyed white people screaming f you you're white shut up. You're white. You can't speak and they're white yelling this at you
[2:16:12.300 --> 2:16:17.580]  I've got hundreds of videos. It's like they're so cartoonish and I don't know what happened to them
[2:16:17.580 --> 2:16:22.220]  I mean, I know you've got some rabid black people after you but I mean, I know you've been out to rallies and stuff
[2:16:22.220 --> 2:16:24.220]  These are some weird white people too
[2:16:27.180 --> 2:16:32.780]  And there's Skype froze right there as soon as it comes back we'll talk to them about that and they they mentioned what's wrong with the left as well
[2:16:34.220 --> 2:16:36.220]  I was sent by a very well-known talk show host
[2:16:36.220 --> 2:16:41.660]  I'll leave it at that a very interesting piece of information about an hour ago and during the breaks. I was reading it
[2:16:42.220 --> 2:16:44.220]  uh, Rolf deegan
[2:16:44.220 --> 2:16:50.700]  On twitter said people vulnerable to depression are less likely to identify with mainstream right parties
[2:16:50.860 --> 2:16:56.860]  Less likely to vote for them and less likely to place themselves on the right side of the autological spectrum. There's a big
[2:16:57.820 --> 2:16:59.580]  medical study
[2:16:59.580 --> 2:17:02.860]  That's been put out by a major medical journal depression and politics
[2:17:02.860 --> 2:17:11.180]  Almost blue and it just goes on to say it's almost completely blue. Who's on the drugs? Who's on the psychotropic? Who is?
[2:17:12.300 --> 2:17:14.300]  Having all these problems
[2:17:14.300 --> 2:17:19.900]  And I'm telling you folks you go out you get around democrats. It is a lunatic
[2:17:20.460 --> 2:17:22.460]  asylum 20 years ago
[2:17:22.780 --> 2:17:27.020]  There were a lot of weirdos in democratic circles, but most of them are anti-war. They were into health stuff
[2:17:27.020 --> 2:17:30.460]  They were pretty smart about you know cell phones cause you know cancer
[2:17:30.460 --> 2:17:34.060]  I mean they were they were informed. I don't know. Are they all dead now?
[2:17:34.700 --> 2:17:39.740]  Where'd they go man Soros bought up the left and it is rabid
[2:17:40.220 --> 2:17:42.220]  Crazy people. Let me tell you something
[2:17:43.260 --> 2:17:48.380]  We go out to any democrat event and we have to use a fake or not a fake organization
[2:17:48.380 --> 2:17:53.420]  But you know like an action seven or something else just so they don't try to kill our reporters
[2:17:54.780 --> 2:17:56.780]  and
[2:17:56.780 --> 2:17:59.180]  It's like a mental institution
[2:17:59.180 --> 2:18:01.180]  A mental institution
[2:18:02.380 --> 2:18:04.880]  You we've all seen mentally ill homeless people. It's very sad
[2:18:06.620 --> 2:18:10.140]  A homeless corner bus stop is more sane than democrat event
[2:18:11.660 --> 2:18:13.660]  and
[2:18:14.540 --> 2:18:20.140]  Then you get all these other people hyped up that are following it all that just start beating the snot out of white people
[2:18:20.940 --> 2:18:24.940]  And I mean if you had groups of white dudes blocking the road beating up black people randomly
[2:18:24.940 --> 2:18:28.940]  Everyone would completely and totally freak out
[2:18:29.900 --> 2:18:31.580]  So
[2:18:31.580 --> 2:18:33.980]  It's crazy and you read the antifa documents that we got
[2:18:35.340 --> 2:18:41.260]  Hello fbi. Hello everybody. You should be investigating this for the plans for marshal on baltimore in 2015
[2:18:42.700 --> 2:18:47.180]  It's white antifa saying we're trying to agitate the blacks to do something
[2:18:48.780 --> 2:18:51.260]  I would never think i'm going to go down to a black neighborhood
[2:18:51.260 --> 2:18:55.020]  And i'm going to try to manipulate them or pay them to go commit crimes
[2:18:55.260 --> 2:18:58.220]  So I can speak for them and say look the blacks are rising up
[2:18:59.580 --> 2:19:03.580]  But that's what the corporate media. That's what all these shills are doing. That's what they're pushing
[2:19:04.300 --> 2:19:07.180]  Again, our guest skype wrote down it happens more and more
[2:19:07.580 --> 2:19:10.300]  skype's now telling folks if your politics is wrong, you can't use it
[2:19:10.620 --> 2:19:12.540]  It's all part of the surveillance. I'm not saying that happened here
[2:19:12.540 --> 2:19:14.620]  But as soon as we get the twins back
[2:19:14.620 --> 2:19:19.820]  We'll do that really interesting fellows that do some great videos the hodge twins conservative twins is what it's called
[2:19:19.820 --> 2:19:21.820]  On youtube
[2:19:23.020 --> 2:19:25.020]  Separately we have 995
[2:19:25.260 --> 2:19:29.260]  Which on average is the average cost so instead of like saying this shirt's five dollars
[2:19:29.260 --> 2:19:31.980]  Does it cost five dollars this shirt's 13 dollars? It's 13 dollars
[2:19:32.540 --> 2:19:34.540]  We just average it together did the math
[2:19:34.940 --> 2:19:38.300]  It's around 995 or so the average cost of a shirt
[2:19:38.780 --> 2:19:42.860]  So whether it's a designer shirt or whether it's just a regular shirt with a great message
[2:19:43.100 --> 2:19:48.780]  Like mass murderers agree gun control works or info or shirt or a designer space force shirt that goes costs like 10 bucks
[2:19:48.780 --> 2:19:50.780]  They're all 9
[2:19:51.340 --> 2:19:56.540]  95 and they've all got info wars.com or news wars.com or band up video on them
[2:19:57.020 --> 2:19:59.660]  And you can choose your own adventure. You wear an info or shirt and let this area

[2:20:08.940 --> 2:20:10.780]  The left wants to extinct this behavior
[2:20:10.780 --> 2:20:13.980]  So now you got to do it because if you think alex jones pops out here on air

[2:21:49.020 --> 2:21:59.020]  You
[2:22:19.020 --> 2:22:48.120]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the
[2:22:48.120 --> 2:22:53.180]  globalist out of their countries. That's why the New World Order is instituting race
[2:22:53.180 --> 2:22:58.700]  war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local
[2:22:58.700 --> 2:23:05.700]  police and government and destroying essential services. This is an attempt to have society
[2:23:05.700 --> 2:23:10.020]  collapse and the globalists as they've done in the third world will come in and pick up
[2:23:10.020 --> 2:23:15.660]  the pieces. He must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU openly
[2:23:15.660 --> 2:23:20.420]  saying defund the police. The police have a lot of problems, we all have a lot of problems,
[2:23:20.420 --> 2:23:24.700]  but this is our government and our local constabulary and believe me once the globalists have overthrown
[2:23:24.700 --> 2:23:29.340]  this country they are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process
[2:23:29.340 --> 2:23:34.100]  or freedom. The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world and they are
[2:23:34.100 --> 2:23:38.900]  orchestrating this entire thing. The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots
[2:23:38.900 --> 2:23:45.900]  and must be opposed. Infowars.com.
[2:24:08.900 --> 2:24:13.700]  It's internal, it's not Bill Gates doing it today. We are on the radio and TV satellites,
[2:24:13.700 --> 2:24:17.820]  this is all the archive, infowars.com and newswars.com. We're not a hundred billion
[2:24:17.820 --> 2:24:20.540]  dollar company or a trillion dollar company like Apple or a seven hundred billion dollar
[2:24:20.540 --> 2:24:26.820]  company like Google. We are all our own infrastructure, radio, TV, satellites, the feeds, the connections,
[2:24:26.820 --> 2:24:31.580]  all of it and we get attached to certain pieces of equipment around here and a lot of weirdness,
[2:24:31.580 --> 2:24:36.300]  but we're going to continue to try to stay on air as long as we can. Going back to our
[2:24:36.300 --> 2:24:43.380]  guest here today, I have a clip here that's up on infowars.com. Check yourself. Cornel
[2:24:43.380 --> 2:24:49.420]  West explodes on Leo Terrell during handy debate about defunding police. This is all
[2:24:49.420 --> 2:24:52.740]  this bullying about people's views. Here it is.
[2:24:52.740 --> 2:24:56.500]  You know, Sean, you asked Dr. Cornel West the type of question you asked in the court
[2:24:56.500 --> 2:25:00.260]  of law. He won't answer because he's just giving you old talking points. I'll speak
[2:25:00.260 --> 2:25:05.180]  to you, Dr. Cornel West, black man to black man. There's a loopy going on and you try
[2:25:05.180 --> 2:25:10.860]  to conflate. It's my turn. It's my turn. You try to conflate. You try to conflate
[2:25:10.860 --> 2:25:16.860]  protesting and police misconduct and shame on you and you're absolutely wrong. You won't
[2:25:16.860 --> 2:25:21.660]  address the issue. You will refuse to address the issue because I'm talking to you. I'm
[2:25:21.660 --> 2:25:26.260]  talking to you. You're not my brother. You're not my brother. You are. You are hurting black
[2:25:26.260 --> 2:25:31.100]  people by acting in this position. You are taking the wrong position. That's it. No,
[2:25:31.100 --> 2:25:39.340]  my brother. That's the place out. That's the question. Do you? Oh my gosh. You have lost
[2:25:39.340 --> 2:25:46.020]  control. You're a dinosaur. You're a dinosaur. You have lost it, sir. I'm not part of your
[2:25:46.020 --> 2:25:56.220]  group. I'm not part of your group. You are a dinosaur. And you know what? You are wrong,
[2:25:56.220 --> 2:25:59.980]  my friend. No, I don't think so because your position is so way up.
[2:25:59.980 --> 2:26:06.540]  I love how Cornel West is wearing his mask in his house. It's all like I'm good. You're
[2:26:06.540 --> 2:26:11.500]  not good. And the whole thing's a hoax. They put all the regular deaths in the COVID-19
[2:26:11.500 --> 2:26:17.300]  column. It's all come out. It's a hoax. Bill Gates' models were 23 times higher than what
[2:26:17.300 --> 2:26:22.900]  even happened. Gentlemen, well, let's finish another minute of this and your take on Cornel
[2:26:22.900 --> 2:26:50.620]  West meltdown. Here it is. Hang on, guys. Leo, give me a second. Guys, everybody's
[2:26:50.620 --> 2:26:55.860]  mic down. Hang on, guys. One at a time. Cornel West, then we'll go to Leo. Cornel, you're
[2:26:55.860 --> 2:27:04.300]  up. Now in Florida, Junior put in the grave. No, no, no. Leo? Okay. I'll wait. Thank you.
[2:27:04.300 --> 2:27:09.140]  Can I just, you know what? You asked him a very simple question. He won't say he's against
[2:27:09.140 --> 2:27:13.940]  defunding the police because you know what? He's in favor of defunding the police. I'm
[2:27:13.940 --> 2:27:20.860]  opposed to it. And this man is a dinosaur. We have to protect our community, our black
[2:27:20.860 --> 2:27:25.860]  community. You know what? Professor West and I are on this program because we have education.
[2:27:25.860 --> 2:27:31.100]  We have to improve education. Let me go back to Professor West. Professor, go ahead. I
[2:27:31.100 --> 2:27:35.500]  love the term. I call mainstream media dinosaur media. I coined that term 20 years ago. But
[2:27:35.500 --> 2:27:40.500]  this whole system is a dinosaur system. What do you guys make of this freak out? Defunding
[2:27:40.500 --> 2:27:47.380]  the police. I mean, if anybody should be against defunding the police, it's black people. Black
[2:27:47.380 --> 2:27:52.500]  people don't even realize that half the murders in this country is done committed by 5% of
[2:27:52.500 --> 2:27:58.940]  the population. That 5% of the population is black Americans. Yeah. That guy, this whole
[2:27:58.940 --> 2:28:05.100]  defunding police started with George Floyd's murder. Do y'all realize what his record was?
[2:28:05.100 --> 2:28:10.860]  That guy once robbed a pregnant woman and put a gun to her stomach. Yeah. I mean, nobody
[2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:16.380]  says anything until, unfortunately, just because his police officer is white, then the mainstream
[2:28:16.380 --> 2:28:21.020]  media wants to feed this lie to American people, especially the black community that you're
[2:28:21.020 --> 2:28:25.500]  being hunted down like animals when that's not even the case. And defunding the police
[2:28:25.500 --> 2:28:29.820]  department, we need police. Without a police department, you don't have a civil society.
[2:28:29.820 --> 2:28:37.460]  Yeah. Look what's happened over the last week with police. What is it in LA? 244% increase
[2:28:37.460 --> 2:28:43.900]  in homicides since this happened. Right. It's crazy. You want to get rid of the police?
[2:28:43.900 --> 2:28:48.620]  Yeah. But they don't like what happened to a mob robbery. Y'all see that's vigilante
[2:28:48.620 --> 2:28:52.180]  justice. You know, statistically, I got an article here. The left is more often calling
[2:28:52.180 --> 2:28:55.940]  the police that they want the police forever. They want the police to arrest us if we're
[2:28:55.940 --> 2:28:59.980]  not wearing masks, but they want to defund them. Again, there's no logic. Sorry. It's
[2:28:59.980 --> 2:29:05.260]  a 250%. I don't know why I said 244. I think the actual number is 244. But I mean, look
[2:29:05.260 --> 2:29:13.140]  at that. Yeah. It's no logic. It's irrational. And this guy, this professor, he's actually
[2:29:13.140 --> 2:29:17.620]  teaching kids our future generation. Yeah. This man looked like he belongs to the mental
[2:29:17.620 --> 2:29:25.420]  asylum defunding the police. He looks like a mad man. He does. He does look like a crazy
[2:29:25.420 --> 2:29:30.980]  Einstein. Psychopath. That dude needs to be in a straight
[2:29:30.980 --> 2:29:37.380]  jacket in a room. That's what he looked like on Fox News. Man, some people watch you. This
[2:29:37.380 --> 2:29:42.820]  is how you act. Imagine how this guy acts behind closed doors in his own house, talking
[2:29:42.820 --> 2:29:49.700]  about when it's not on the record. Yeah. Uncivil, irrational, mental case. And this guy's in
[2:29:49.700 --> 2:29:53.940]  charge of our future, but the black community, they look up to this guy. By the way, I'm
[2:29:53.940 --> 2:29:58.460]  a big fan of Leo Terrell. I've read his writings and heard some of his show, but he was kicking
[2:29:58.460 --> 2:30:01.900]  ass right there. We need to get this guy on the air. He was just knocking it out. He
[2:30:01.900 --> 2:30:06.620]  said, listen, I don't belong to you just because I'm black and you're black. You don't speak
[2:30:06.620 --> 2:30:10.580]  like some white dude would tell me you're white. So I speak for you and I speak for
[2:30:10.580 --> 2:30:17.220]  you and you speak for me. That's how cults operate. That's exactly it. He's preaching
[2:30:17.220 --> 2:30:22.220]  black supremacy. If white people can't do it, watching blacks do that. It's the exact
[2:30:22.220 --> 2:30:26.140]  same logic. Oh, you're not being white right now. He's doing the exact same thing. Oh,
[2:30:26.140 --> 2:30:30.220]  you're not being black. You're not my brother right now. He's preaching black supremacy.
[2:30:30.220 --> 2:30:33.980]  You either believe in everything I say, or you're not one of us. Yeah. And you hit the
[2:30:33.980 --> 2:30:39.100]  nerve on the head, Alex. That's like a cult ideology. Yeah. Somebody else speaks for you.
[2:30:39.100 --> 2:30:43.660]  No, I speak for myself. Yeah. I had family reach out to me, Alex. Oh, what would your
[2:30:43.660 --> 2:30:49.860]  mom think? Or what would your aunt think? Because I don't check in with my aunt and ask her permission
[2:30:49.860 --> 2:30:54.300]  who the mayor or how to think or how to live my life. Yeah, I'm a grown man. Yeah, I think
[2:30:54.300 --> 2:30:58.980]  for myself. Yeah, I'm the man I am because of my mama. My mama told me to practice self
[2:30:58.980 --> 2:31:04.220]  accountability. If my mom was still alive today, she would be happy with any of this
[2:31:04.220 --> 2:31:09.380]  stuff. But this is what is taught in black communities. Yeah. I'm an uncle Tom. I'm
[2:31:09.380 --> 2:31:15.100]  a coon if I don't think like that. Well, you take the police officer, uh, David Dorn that
[2:31:15.100 --> 2:31:20.700]  got shot and killed, a retired detective, a retired captain. And it came out in the
[2:31:20.700 --> 2:31:23.780]  news. Well, he was a black guy protecting the business turned out it was a black business.
[2:31:23.780 --> 2:31:28.060]  He was protected. But who cares? How is he an uncle Tom? Because he did well and was
[2:31:28.060 --> 2:31:32.660]  loved the community and was a police captain. How is black people becoming the establishment
[2:31:32.660 --> 2:31:38.180]  bad? That's that's that's becoming the system. I mean, how the left teaches black people
[2:31:38.180 --> 2:31:43.660]  that you stay poor on welfare and you never run anything. And if anybody ever gets in
[2:31:43.660 --> 2:31:48.380]  a position, they're a sellout. That is the again, they're literally, as they say, trying
[2:31:48.380 --> 2:31:54.260]  to keep black people down. Yeah, our school system, especially in the black, you know,
[2:31:54.260 --> 2:31:58.940]  urban urban neighborhoods have have failed black kids. I mean, if the reason why we study
[2:31:58.940 --> 2:32:04.180]  history so we won't prevent it, Thomas Jefferson said it years ago, if your government is big
[2:32:04.180 --> 2:32:09.180]  enough to give you something, they're big enough to take that away from you. And people,
[2:32:09.180 --> 2:32:16.420]  black people don't realize that big government is not good. It's just it's just it's not
[2:32:16.420 --> 2:32:20.980]  the answer. It's not the answer. The only way any person is going to live the American
[2:32:20.980 --> 2:32:28.180]  dream is to hard work making great decisions and practicing self accountability. Your figures,
[2:32:28.180 --> 2:32:33.700]  your failures cannot be blamed on the white man. You need to look in the mirror. Yeah,
[2:32:33.700 --> 2:32:39.340]  your fails cannot be blamed on something that happened 400 years ago. People, black folks
[2:32:39.340 --> 2:32:44.540]  are actually walking around thinking they're slaves. They keep going in the past. We can't
[2:32:44.540 --> 2:32:48.860]  change the past, but you can change your future being self accountable. It's not just black
[2:32:48.860 --> 2:32:54.540]  folks. I know so many people that think being a victim is like the royal or something. Oh,
[2:32:54.540 --> 2:32:59.060]  something bad happened to me. So now you've got to take care of me and feel sorry for me.
[2:32:59.060 --> 2:33:02.740]  I had all sorts of bad stuff happen to me. And quite frankly, the fact that I survived
[2:33:02.740 --> 2:33:06.740]  it, I look back on those bad times. And it's like they were good. I'm not defending bad
[2:33:06.740 --> 2:33:11.220]  things happening, but Nietzsche said it. That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[2:33:11.220 --> 2:33:16.340]  Yeah, bad things happen to everybody. Yeah, when bad stuff happened to you, take it as
[2:33:16.340 --> 2:33:20.660]  an opportunity to learn from it. So it never happens again. Instead, people like to victimize
[2:33:20.660 --> 2:33:25.980]  that self and they glorify it. Yeah. And they're doomed to keep repeating being, uh, make
[2:33:25.980 --> 2:33:29.780]  them. I appreciate you coming on the broadcast. Folks can find you on Twitter at conservative
[2:33:29.780 --> 2:33:33.300]  twins. I want to come back and give you the floor on any topics you want to cover in the
[2:33:33.300 --> 2:33:37.940]  final segment of this hour. Then John Rabaport is ready to go. I'm going to hit the psychological
[2:33:37.940 --> 2:33:43.220]  study on the left being five times more depressed than conservatives. What info wars has been
[2:33:43.220 --> 2:33:48.500]  able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth has been nothing
[2:33:48.500 --> 2:33:56.220]  short of historic and truly epic. This is the battle for the future of humanity. And now
[2:33:56.220 --> 2:34:03.100]  open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[2:34:03.100 --> 2:34:09.540]  Now the internal operations of the globalist are being externalized. You must decide which
[2:34:09.540 --> 2:34:14.940]  side you're on. Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness will
[2:34:14.940 --> 2:34:20.980]  only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally death. And this is a spiritual
[2:34:20.980 --> 2:34:27.660]  death. We're talking about not just a physical death. The delusions must end now. Info wars
[2:34:27.660 --> 2:34:33.020]  was correct about it all. We have come so far by exposing the enemy. Most people that
[2:34:33.020 --> 2:34:37.740]  are aware of the new will order decided to join it out of fear. They are truly fools.
[2:34:37.740 --> 2:34:45.980]  We must fight this or lose our souls. Aerodyne technology delivery system, the first of its
[2:34:45.980 --> 2:34:52.100]  kind pure nascent atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle. The next
[2:34:52.100 --> 2:34:58.500]  level of innovation of X2 is here. Introducing survival shield X2 spray. The great part about
[2:34:58.500 --> 2:35:02.780]  the X2 spray is it's great on the go. When you've got it in the dropper, it's great
[2:35:02.780 --> 2:35:07.580]  at your house. It's great at work. But this is great for the car. It's great to keep with
[2:35:07.580 --> 2:35:12.940]  you. And again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not
[2:35:12.940 --> 2:35:17.340]  to just ingest it into the stomach. We're really excited about it. It's 33% off out
[2:35:17.340 --> 2:35:22.060]  of the gates. It was listeners idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that
[2:35:22.060 --> 2:35:26.020]  had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes
[2:35:26.020 --> 2:35:30.860]  it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way. Get your survival
[2:35:30.860 --> 2:35:37.020]  shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and experience the
[2:35:37.020 --> 2:35:43.580]  power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[2:35:43.580 --> 2:35:48.420]  The United States is not communist China. We don't have 3 million people in concentration
[2:35:48.420 --> 2:35:54.220]  camps. We don't blow up churches. We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[2:35:54.220 --> 2:36:00.460]  But all over the news, we see U.N., billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[2:36:00.460 --> 2:36:05.860]  praising communist China for their response. And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints
[2:36:05.860 --> 2:36:10.100]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well, then gee,
[2:36:10.100 --> 2:36:13.980]  we've got to do that. And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying we'll
[2:36:13.980 --> 2:36:19.180]  arrest you if you say Chinese virus. Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European
[2:36:19.180 --> 2:36:25.020]  virus. These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time
[2:36:25.020 --> 2:36:29.220]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[2:36:29.220 --> 2:36:35.980]  power grab. The resistance lives at band.video and infowarstore.com. Spread those links and
[2:36:35.980 --> 2:36:39.700]  jam it down the censors' throats, and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that
[2:36:39.700 --> 2:36:40.700]  much quicker.
[2:36:40.700 --> 2:36:54.340]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax,
[2:36:54.340 --> 2:37:03.100]  and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020. We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[2:37:03.100 --> 2:37:08.180]  Well, I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even
[2:37:08.180 --> 2:37:14.380]  a bigger race war. It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong,
[2:37:14.380 --> 2:37:19.580]  you name it. The globalists are attacking on every front. That's why now more than ever
[2:37:19.580 --> 2:37:24.540]  we have to realize, they tried to censor info wars off the air because they knew that when
[2:37:24.540 --> 2:37:28.700]  they launched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be
[2:37:28.700 --> 2:37:34.940]  on air. But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air. So let's boost that transmission
[2:37:34.940 --> 2:37:59.900]  like the Batman's signal now more than ever, info wars.com lives.
[2:38:05.580 --> 2:38:09.620]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here live. I was just in the break room getting a glass of
[2:38:09.620 --> 2:38:17.460]  water and there was Fauci saying, oh, COVID-19 is far from over. In fact, it's worse because
[2:38:17.460 --> 2:38:21.340]  there's more tests go out, they've been proven that are fraudulent. About a bubble in the
[2:38:21.340 --> 2:38:25.940]  gates that got shut down by the FDA, not before tens of thousands of tests went out, tens
[2:38:25.940 --> 2:38:31.820]  of millions. They didn't say, oh, you're all positive. Nobody's sick of this meat packing
[2:38:31.820 --> 2:38:38.940]  plan, but we got to close it. Sabotaging the entire economy. Meanwhile, Elmo and his dad
[2:38:38.940 --> 2:38:44.380]  discussed why racism is a huge problem in our country in CNN town hall. Now, oh, we don't
[2:38:44.380 --> 2:38:50.220]  believe lying CNN puppets of the New World Order. So now they give us actual puppets.
[2:38:50.220 --> 2:38:54.460]  This is getting too insane. The hodge twins find the great work of conservative twins
[2:38:54.460 --> 2:38:57.980]  on YouTube and gentlemen, fire at your website as well. Because I mean, I'm all about promoting
[2:38:57.980 --> 2:39:01.220]  the big platforms. People can find you, but it's also important to promote the actual
[2:39:01.220 --> 2:39:06.380]  websites. People can find you there in cyberspace, give folks the best website for you. Yeah,
[2:39:06.380 --> 2:39:10.980]  you can follow us on Instagram with official hodge twins. Yeah, we're on YouTube at the
[2:39:10.980 --> 2:39:19.260]  hodge twins. No, that's Facebook. Oh, YouTube, we're conservative 20. Right. All right, gentlemen,
[2:39:19.260 --> 2:39:23.820]  I could ask a lot of questions, but just at the time we have here, what else do you want
[2:39:23.820 --> 2:39:29.900]  to put front and center to the couple million folks that are watching? Man, it's man. This
[2:39:29.900 --> 2:39:35.500]  is what we've seen over the last week or so has been a culmination of what the media's
[2:39:35.500 --> 2:39:40.860]  been pushing on the left for like the last couple of years. Now those chickens are coming
[2:39:40.860 --> 2:39:45.780]  home the roots and they're getting what they want. Our society is starting to crumble.
[2:39:45.780 --> 2:39:50.980]  I don't want a lot of people to buy into this country's races. I mean, we've traveled all
[2:39:50.980 --> 2:39:55.180]  over this country. We've traveled all over the world. This is still the best country
[2:39:55.180 --> 2:39:59.540]  on this planet. Do not feed into the lives that mainstream media is preaching everybody
[2:39:59.540 --> 2:40:05.820]  that whites are against blacks. Don't believe that. A majority of people in the United States
[2:40:05.820 --> 2:40:11.100]  are good people, hardworking people, not racist. Yeah. Don't let a few bad apples destroy the
[2:40:11.100 --> 2:40:16.500]  entire bunch. This is still the greatest country on this planet, but we have to still continue
[2:40:16.500 --> 2:40:23.300]  to fight for this country because this country is under attack from within our own politicians.
[2:40:23.300 --> 2:40:28.740]  Yeah. They're trying to take this country in the direction that other countries have
[2:40:28.740 --> 2:40:32.940]  taken in the past and those countries have failed. People are actually fleeing those
[2:40:32.940 --> 2:40:38.180]  countries to come here, but now we're trying to institute those same failed policies from
[2:40:38.180 --> 2:40:44.700]  other countries. Yeah. We need to stand up. Yeah. You need to believe in our country capitalism.
[2:40:44.700 --> 2:40:51.540]  It's the best political economic system that's freed more people out of poverty. This socialism,
[2:40:51.540 --> 2:40:56.780]  it does not work. You not buy into a huge government that's going to provide you a house
[2:40:56.780 --> 2:41:01.340]  you're American dream. It will not happen. It cannot happen. The only way you're going
[2:41:01.340 --> 2:41:05.860]  to achieve the American dream is through hard work and making good decisions. You never
[2:41:05.860 --> 2:41:09.500]  want to have bowed down in your government. Your government can't give you that American
[2:41:09.500 --> 2:41:14.740]  dream. You have to remember when that sad black lady in Florida got up and asked Obama
[2:41:14.740 --> 2:41:19.420]  for a free house and he said, we'll get it for you. And then the Democrats never called
[2:41:19.420 --> 2:41:23.620]  her, but Republicans got together and got her the house to make a point. But that is
[2:41:23.620 --> 2:41:27.500]  just sick to tell that woman, we're going to help you. She's living out of her car and
[2:41:27.500 --> 2:41:33.180]  they didn't even help her. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they just, whatever they do, it's for a vote.
[2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:37.460]  It's not out of the goodness of the heart. Yeah. They're seeking power. That's all they
[2:41:37.460 --> 2:41:42.180]  want. Yeah. Soon as that camera turns on, Alex, they start, they go into that little,
[2:41:42.180 --> 2:41:46.660]  little, little acting role they're going to. Soon as that camera turns on, it's like they
[2:41:46.660 --> 2:41:50.380]  cut it off. They forget everything they just said. And that's because the system recruits
[2:41:50.380 --> 2:41:56.020]  sociopaths. Sociopaths are maybe one out of 50 people folks, but the studies show that
[2:41:56.020 --> 2:42:00.340]  sociopaths and psychopaths at the top of a government during its collapse. And I think
[2:42:00.340 --> 2:42:05.460]  we're going into the collapse cycle. As you said, I hope we can have a renaissance and
[2:42:05.460 --> 2:42:11.700]  come out of it. What do you guys see longterm? Longterm, we got a Trump's got to get reelected
[2:42:11.700 --> 2:42:16.020]  because I mean, what they're pushing on the bottom has no backbone. This guy's actually
[2:42:16.020 --> 2:42:22.740]  pushing policies. He's never stood for his 40 years in office. He's never stood for
[2:42:22.740 --> 2:42:27.540]  any of this stuff. And now he's, he's advocating for all this socialist crap. All these horrible
[2:42:27.540 --> 2:42:32.660]  ideas because he has no backbone. Trump's a true leader, true leader. He's going to
[2:42:32.660 --> 2:42:38.900]  take this country in the right direction. He needs to get reelected. I hate to imagine
[2:42:38.900 --> 2:42:43.900]  him losing an election. Yeah. What that would do. I couldn't imagine it either, but sometimes
[2:42:43.900 --> 2:42:48.740]  Alex, you do have to take two steps back before you can walk forwards. Hopefully we don't
[2:42:48.740 --> 2:42:52.900]  have to take those two steps backwards in the meantime. We took those two steps back
[2:42:52.900 --> 2:42:59.620]  with Obama. Trump, we taking steps forward. No, I agree, but it's, you talk about a backlash
[2:42:59.620 --> 2:43:03.220]  though. If Biden got in because look, here's the deal. Maybe Trump's going too far with
[2:43:03.220 --> 2:43:06.860]  his prison reform, but there are people that have been in jail 30 years for one thing.
[2:43:06.860 --> 2:43:10.260]  They need to get out. I mean, I think some of it is too extreme, but here's Trump doing
[2:43:10.260 --> 2:43:15.140]  what liberals always said they wanted. Biden's the guy with lock up all the black people
[2:43:15.140 --> 2:43:18.420]  and then he's the one up there saying Trump wants to hurt the black people. I mean, it's
[2:43:18.420 --> 2:43:23.740]  just not true. It's just, it, when you know the players, it's ridiculously fraudulent.
[2:43:23.740 --> 2:43:28.980]  Yeah. Yeah. It's like, how many times someone's going to tell you these lies, like Mimi showed
[2:43:28.980 --> 2:43:32.460]  up at the, uh, the black church and told everybody they're going to put you back in
[2:43:32.460 --> 2:43:38.220]  chains and there's no pushback. Yeah. They believe everything this man says, they, they
[2:43:38.220 --> 2:43:43.020]  on the left, they preach that old white man or races, but they sit back and listen to
[2:43:43.020 --> 2:43:48.620]  him. Yeah. Joe Biden is a whole white man. There's nothing wrong with being older than
[2:43:48.620 --> 2:43:52.740]  white. Yeah. I'll tell you this. The average old white person is like a virtue signaling
[2:43:52.740 --> 2:44:01.220]  liberal who literally is on another planet. I mean, I, it's just crazy. I wouldn't call
[2:44:01.220 --> 2:44:07.740]  them liberal anymore. They're far from liberal. Yeah. I wish they would bring liberals back.
[2:44:07.740 --> 2:44:13.740]  These people are lefties. I agree. You're right. In fact, Prager, you have a great,
[2:44:13.740 --> 2:44:18.540]  uh, five minute piece on the difference between a liberal and a lefty. You guys give me your
[2:44:18.540 --> 2:44:22.380]  definition and closing of a liberal versus a lefty.
[2:44:22.380 --> 2:44:28.740]  A liberal is typically, it's typically what a, a Republican is now leftist. They're illogical.
[2:44:28.740 --> 2:44:34.740]  They irrational. Yeah. Their views are hypocritical. Yeah. I mean, they, they, they, they come
[2:44:34.740 --> 2:44:40.700]  up with far just dumb stuff. There's no such thing as gender science has already proven
[2:44:40.700 --> 2:44:47.500]  this hundreds of years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Typical liberal nowadays, they don't believe in anything
[2:44:47.500 --> 2:44:51.740]  or true liberal belief. They're like second amendment freedom of speech. Yeah. Everything
[2:44:51.740 --> 2:44:56.500]  nowadays they've, they've stolen that term liberal and made it into something that is
[2:44:56.500 --> 2:45:01.860]  not. I totally agree. Yeah, but they're not liberal anymore. They're leftist. They're
[2:45:01.860 --> 2:45:07.860]  illogical. They're no reason that whatsoever. Never knew what you had until it's gone. I
[2:45:07.860 --> 2:45:12.260]  wish the liberals would come back. I agree. Back that up. I love that one senator with
[2:45:12.260 --> 2:45:16.820]  a white hair. I forget his name. He's got a leopard print face mask as well with his
[2:45:16.820 --> 2:45:20.420]  Kwanzaa outfit. I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[2:45:20.420 --> 2:45:26.180]  Right. If I showed up at black friend's house and like a, like a Zulu outfit, they'd be
[2:45:26.180 --> 2:45:30.660]  like, what the hell is this? I'd be like, is this a joke? They'd laugh about it. But
[2:45:30.660 --> 2:45:35.820]  I mean, if I showed up serious though and said, I like you and I like a black face on
[2:45:35.820 --> 2:45:40.820]  I was an African outfit. They'd like, this is crazy, man. These people are crazy. I don't
[2:45:40.820 --> 2:45:48.380]  know how that looks to the average person. Right. I mean, I was, I was thinking maybe
[2:45:48.380 --> 2:45:54.620]  Nancy was going to braid her hair. I thought, I thought, um, what's the, what's the big
[2:45:54.620 --> 2:46:00.060]  guy's name? Jared Nantle. Maybe he should have showed up in corn rolls. Yeah. He done,
[2:46:00.060 --> 2:46:02.300]  I don't think he knows what planet he's on, man.
[2:46:02.300 --> 2:46:08.980]  Look, I was trying to put the mask on. That was like, and this guy can't even put a face
[2:46:08.980 --> 2:46:12.460]  mask on. This guy is a member of our government. Yeah.
[2:46:12.460 --> 2:46:17.780]  He's in the committee house. And then she can't even get back up. She's leading this
[2:46:17.780 --> 2:46:21.740]  country and she doesn't know her own physical health. If I get down right here, I'm not
[2:46:21.740 --> 2:46:25.220]  going to be able to get back up, but see, but she's leading this country.
[2:46:25.220 --> 2:46:28.980]  I was about to say nothing against her that she couldn't get up. But if you can't get
[2:46:28.980 --> 2:46:34.740]  up, don't do that on camera. Exactly. But you know why she did that, Alex? They thought
[2:46:34.740 --> 2:46:39.100]  they was going to edit that part out. She knew she couldn't get back up. They wanted
[2:46:39.100 --> 2:46:41.660]  those cameras to make them look good. Yeah.
[2:46:41.660 --> 2:46:47.580]  These are crazy gentlemen. You're awesome. And again, on YouTube, it is conservative
[2:46:47.580 --> 2:46:51.260]  twins and people can find everything there. The hodge twins. We love you. Please come
[2:46:51.260 --> 2:46:54.740]  back again, my friends. Oh, thank you for having us.
[2:46:54.740 --> 2:46:57.860]  Folks, please boost what they're doing. They're reaching millions of people a week. They've
[2:46:57.860 --> 2:47:01.740]  had a lot of courage and please boost us. The only way we get out and reach new people
[2:47:01.740 --> 2:47:07.700]  is when you take action. All right. Normally somebody who's a great host, John Rapoport
[2:47:07.700 --> 2:47:10.820]  is like, yeah, I don't care if I do the show or not for a tower. He's like, I want to do
[2:47:10.820 --> 2:47:16.700]  the fourth hour today. John Rapoport is fired up. He is ready to take over, but I've got
[2:47:16.700 --> 2:47:23.060]  to play Fauci. And the crazy stuff he's doing. And then this report about Democrats being
[2:47:23.060 --> 2:47:27.700]  way more likely to be on psychotrophics and being depressed. We already know that, but
[2:47:27.700 --> 2:47:34.420]  they don't just look like mental patients for nothing. They are mental patients and the
[2:47:34.420 --> 2:47:38.380]  mental illness is growing because it's been made fashionable to turn Lucy, your mind and
[2:47:38.380 --> 2:47:44.860]  go crazy. So that's all coming up separately. High quality, storeable food is now available.
[2:47:44.860 --> 2:47:49.500]  Now only a four week wait. In fact, some people are getting in two weeks with all the craziness
[2:47:49.500 --> 2:47:53.620]  in the world, folks. You need storeable food in case Trump fails, in case we fail, in case
[2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:56.820]  it goes into total depression, which there's a good chance it will. I don't want to be
[2:47:56.820 --> 2:48:00.100]  negative. I'm just telling you, you're crazy. If you don't get storeable food in the highest
[2:48:00.100 --> 2:48:06.780]  quality, very low price, very affordable, ready to ship to you is available at infoworkstore.com.
[2:48:06.780 --> 2:48:10.460]  And then that funds this infrastructure and everything we're doing and a lot of upgrades
[2:48:10.460 --> 2:48:12.980]  and a lot of things we're doing behind the scenes. Take a lot of money to run this operation.
[2:48:12.980 --> 2:48:18.220]  So I want to thank you all. We've got like, I learned 10 year old switches for the internet.
[2:48:18.220 --> 2:48:23.060]  That's $60,000. They just reordered new switches earlier because it knocked us off the internet.
[2:48:23.060 --> 2:48:27.580]  So that just, it takes money to run this. I want to thank you all for your support infowarstore.com.
[2:48:27.580 --> 2:48:32.580]  We now have the X2 and spray bottles as well.
[2:48:32.580 --> 2:48:39.540]  This is the end, my friends. My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of
[2:48:39.540 --> 2:48:47.620]  everything that stands, the end, the safety, the delusion. It's all over, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:48:47.620 --> 2:48:54.380]  because there was only the mirage of safety. Movies and partying and living like children,
[2:48:54.380 --> 2:48:59.420]  never growing up, never caring about other people. This delivered us into the hands of
[2:48:59.420 --> 2:49:04.100]  tyranny. Just like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states. Every time
[2:49:04.100 --> 2:49:09.620]  Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity
[2:49:09.620 --> 2:49:15.220]  because their people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they
[2:49:15.220 --> 2:49:20.860]  were enslaved. We are repeating that again today. Compliance and going along with this
[2:49:20.860 --> 2:49:27.860]  system leads to absolute bondage. Info wars has decided to fight for freedom. Info wars
[2:49:27.860 --> 2:49:32.460]  has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[2:49:32.460 --> 2:49:38.260]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot
[2:49:38.260 --> 2:49:42.900]  an L, it could stay 600 yards. Even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still
[2:49:42.900 --> 2:49:50.860]  run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards. They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries
[2:49:50.860 --> 2:49:55.420]  and through their veins. But all of a sudden, they slow down. They realize what's happened.
[2:49:55.420 --> 2:50:01.340]  They fall over and they die. Then you go back and haul them back in. Well, that's what's
[2:50:01.340 --> 2:50:07.140]  going to happen to the entire world now. And that's what the economic numbers show, is
[2:50:07.140 --> 2:50:11.860]  that we've been shot right in the heart. And for the first world, it's going to mean a
[2:50:11.860 --> 2:50:16.620]  long, horrible depression and a lot of death. Well, for the third world, it's going to mean
[2:50:16.620 --> 2:50:20.300]  probably over 100 million dead according to the UN and I believe their numbers. Because
[2:50:20.300 --> 2:50:25.180]  it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world. So to all
[2:50:25.180 --> 2:50:28.860]  the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers
[2:50:28.860 --> 2:50:35.580]  and you've bought into something better than what Hitler did.
[2:50:35.580 --> 2:50:45.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:45.300 --> 2:51:07.820]  The Republic is live. Operation Off World initiated. Rain boost completed. Galactic orbit. Come
[2:51:07.820 --> 2:51:14.860]  and sing. I'm Alex Jones, your host, broadcasting worldwide.
[2:51:14.860 --> 2:51:18.860]  I wanted to hit this because I've been to do it for days. When I get up here and I say
[2:51:18.860 --> 2:51:23.420]  the United Nations is running the riots, the UN is running our medicine. I don't just say
[2:51:23.420 --> 2:51:29.140]  that. Treaty signed by George Herbert Walker Bush and others have us under UNESCO. And even
[2:51:29.140 --> 2:51:32.620]  though Trump two years ago pulled us out of UNESCO and UNESCO Treaty, which is a great
[2:51:32.620 --> 2:51:38.100]  thing Trump did, just like he's pulling us out of the WHO, it's still being implemented
[2:51:38.100 --> 2:51:44.140]  through the agreements and bureaucracies because Trump isn't a mastermind of studying how this
[2:51:44.140 --> 2:51:47.860]  works. And I'm not blaming him. He was running hundreds of properties and all this other
[2:51:47.860 --> 2:51:54.900]  stuff. But we've done the study. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, back at the time,
[2:51:54.900 --> 2:52:01.500]  2015, announces the launch of the Strong Cities Network at United Nations General Assembly,
[2:52:01.500 --> 2:52:09.580]  Justice.gov. There's video of her saying the UN will oversee our police and disarm them.
[2:52:09.580 --> 2:52:14.340]  The Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremism in the United
[2:52:14.340 --> 2:52:21.980]  States. They already run our healthcare. Launch of Strong Cities Network to strengthen community,
[2:52:21.980 --> 2:52:27.820]  resilience against violent extremism, Justice.gov. And you read it and it says they'll disarm
[2:52:27.820 --> 2:52:36.060]  the American people and the police and then have a UN paramilitary force that controls
[2:52:36.060 --> 2:52:43.540]  it all. You need to go read this from yourself. You need to understand what's really going
[2:52:43.540 --> 2:52:49.500]  on. But we're going to go to break and come back with Fauci saying the lockdown never ends.
[2:52:49.500 --> 2:52:54.180]  And then John Rappaport taking over. But first, this is on infowords.com. Elmo and his dad
[2:52:54.180 --> 2:52:59.420]  discussed why racism is a huge problem in our country at CNN's Town Hall. The new gimmick
[2:52:59.420 --> 2:53:03.100]  is, oh, you know the puppet politicians. You don't like them or the puppet reporters
[2:53:03.100 --> 2:53:08.580]  reading teleprompters. How about actual puppets now talking to you like you're five years old
[2:53:08.580 --> 2:53:12.260]  trying to put you into a trance. Here it is.
[2:53:12.260 --> 2:53:39.580]  A protest is when people come together to show they are upset and disagree about something.
[2:53:39.580 --> 2:53:45.940]  They want to make others aware of the problem. This is more mind control. They know the average
[2:53:45.940 --> 2:53:49.100]  baby boomer watches this as a kid now. So they're literally trying to put you in a trance
[2:53:49.100 --> 2:53:57.660]  like Mr. Rogers. Yeah, I'm bringing this sign to the protest at the community center
[2:53:57.660 --> 2:54:06.580]  later. I mean, look at this crap. We could do something better just in five minutes.
[2:54:06.580 --> 2:54:10.540]  They are sad. Oh, you know, the main Elmo got her not was a pedophile. Every right to
[2:54:10.540 --> 2:54:17.700]  be Elmo. People are upset. Oh, Elmo, people being mean to you, Elmo. We're gonna put
[2:54:17.700 --> 2:54:25.900]  you in a Chinese death camp. Oh, that liberal. Oh, racism is when people treat. I love the
[2:54:25.900 --> 2:54:31.520]  white dude doing Elmo's dad's voice is like, how you doing? Never go full retard. Like
[2:54:31.520 --> 2:54:37.420]  dropping thunder. So money on it. The guy doing Elmo's dad's voice is a white dude,
[2:54:37.420 --> 2:54:40.860]  which is another form of blackface, which I say fine, have a white to do like this
[2:54:40.860 --> 2:54:48.420]  voice. But like, Elmo, they're coming to get you, Elmo. Oh, white devil's Elmo. Elmo,
[2:54:48.420 --> 2:54:54.540]  I got a shot for you. Elmo Bill Gates loves black people. He says he wants to kill us.
[2:54:54.540 --> 2:55:00.500]  But just don't just don't just just the huge Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey. She wants to
[2:55:00.500 --> 2:55:07.420]  love on you a little bit, Elmo. She really love on the girls over at Epstein's place.
[2:55:07.420 --> 2:55:11.740]  Just guys going to meet with the girls and you know, Oprah Winfrey like a little girl
[2:55:11.740 --> 2:55:18.740]  here and there, a little friend. Oh, what we are seeing is people saying enough is enough.
[2:55:18.740 --> 2:55:27.740]  They want to end. Yes, even Elmo's against it. No. Thank you for being my dad's voice
[2:55:27.740 --> 2:55:33.740]  isn't true. I want everybody to be treated. I'm going to take pro's that can give it
[2:55:33.740 --> 2:55:42.020]  suicide. Is it pedophile drag queen time now for Elmo? It's finally here. Introducing
[2:55:42.020 --> 2:55:47.020]  the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine. Listers have been
[2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:51.820]  asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal
[2:55:51.820 --> 2:55:56.620]  nascent iodine. After extensive development, it's finally here. Our proprietary new aerodyne
[2:55:56.620 --> 2:56:01.460]  technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7000 feet
[2:56:01.460 --> 2:56:04.940]  below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula. I have been using the new
[2:56:04.940 --> 2:56:09.380]  X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of true nascent iodine
[2:56:09.380 --> 2:56:13.700]  working for my body. I can personally feel the difference. We know iodine is an essential
[2:56:13.700 --> 2:56:18.780]  mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels
[2:56:18.780 --> 2:56:22.860]  and healthy cognitive function. Iodine may also support your body and healthy response
[2:56:22.860 --> 2:56:27.940]  to environmental and dietary toxins. Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience
[2:56:27.940 --> 2:56:33.260]  the benefits of true nascent iodine today. Get the new survival shield X2 spray for 33%
[2:56:33.260 --> 2:56:37.860]  off at infowarstore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment. That's
[2:56:37.860 --> 2:56:54.700]  infowarstore.com. Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones. So what you're all witnessing
[2:56:54.700 --> 2:57:00.260]  is classical brainwashing, classical cult programming and they're saying oh great the
[2:57:00.260 --> 2:57:04.620]  economy screwed up by COVID that'll defeat Trump and oh but don't open it back up though
[2:57:04.620 --> 2:57:11.620]  in the blue states of blue cities and Fauci on the tip of the middle of the Gates Foundation
[2:57:11.620 --> 2:57:16.780]  says oh COVID is just beginning. It's going to get much worse because we're sending out
[2:57:16.780 --> 2:57:20.900]  all the fraudulent tests that the FDA already shut down the middle of the Gates Foundation
[2:57:20.900 --> 2:57:24.900]  for but millions are out there and they're showing COVID is everywhere. No one's sick
[2:57:24.900 --> 2:57:30.860]  at the meat packing plants but if someone, if someone tests positive you've got to shut
[2:57:30.860 --> 2:57:38.620]  the plant down. Not close to over. Oh no. Not even close to over. It doesn't matter if
[2:57:38.620 --> 2:57:43.220]  the German Interior Ministry comes out and says it's all a fraud or the Italian government
[2:57:43.220 --> 2:57:48.420]  comes out or scientists here. No, no, it's all dangerous. It's all over. It's never
[2:57:48.420 --> 2:57:55.900]  ending. You've got to wear a mask unless you're out there protesting George Floyd and then
[2:57:55.900 --> 2:58:01.540]  meanwhile YouTube, Facebook, all of them are censoring any articles with FBI statistics
[2:58:01.540 --> 2:58:07.420]  showing that cops killing unarmed black men is like winning a lottery ticket but in the
[2:58:07.420 --> 2:58:14.140]  bad way. I mean it's rarer than tits on a board. It's not as rare as leprechauns or
[2:58:14.140 --> 2:58:19.500]  Santa Claus because that doesn't exist but it's entering Santa Claus area which shows
[2:58:19.500 --> 2:58:22.860]  the police have just turned these areas over to lawlessness because political correctness
[2:58:22.860 --> 2:58:26.780]  which is why you got record numbers of blacks killing each other. It's very sad to let this
[2:58:26.780 --> 2:58:31.060]  paralyze the police when there's no policing in black neighborhoods now essentially. So
[2:58:31.060 --> 2:58:35.740]  all that's going on. So here's Fauci, the cult leader, the true Jim Jones who says we
[2:58:35.740 --> 2:58:41.900]  should never shake hands again. Shaking hands is over. It's over. They predicted COVID at
[2:58:41.900 --> 2:58:45.900]  20 plus times the death rate. The death rates all fake numbers out of those that had already
[2:58:45.900 --> 2:58:49.780]  died of other things. That's all admitted but it doesn't matter because Fauci gave us
[2:58:49.780 --> 2:58:56.460]  the AIDS fraud. Here he is. I wouldn't be surprised that members of the congregation
[2:58:56.460 --> 2:59:01.940]  that were there demonstrating could also be infected and many of them would then go back
[2:59:01.940 --> 2:59:06.980]  to where they were because not everyone was demonstrating in the city where they live.
[2:59:06.980 --> 2:59:10.980]  They've come from the outside so it's the kind of things that we were concerned about
[2:59:10.980 --> 2:59:17.220]  and unfortunately we're seeing it come true right now. Was that voice who could be anybody
[2:59:17.220 --> 2:59:21.060]  else? Of course, that was the nation's leading infectious disease. That was Fauci telling
[2:59:21.060 --> 2:59:26.580]  you how it works. China's been open for months. So is Sweden. So is many other areas of the
[2:59:26.580 --> 2:59:32.140]  world leader saying it's a hoax. But he says no going outside until there's a vaccine even
[2:59:32.140 --> 2:59:38.420]  though everything he said was a fraud. That's just the way it is. Well, we're about to have
[2:59:38.420 --> 2:59:43.260]  a very important push and investigative journalist John Lappaport take over. But first I wanted
[2:59:43.260 --> 2:59:47.900]  to hit this. The National Talk Show host who will go unnamed. One of the biggest names
[2:59:47.900 --> 2:59:51.980]  out there. There's only two guys that are really bigger than Info Wars and they are.
[2:59:51.980 --> 2:59:57.980]  One of them sent me this. People vulnerable to depression are less likely to identify
[2:59:57.980 --> 3:00:02.540]  with mainstream right parties, less likely to vote for them and less likely to place
[3:00:02.540 --> 3:00:08.380]  themselves on the right side of the ideological perspective. That's Ralph Deegan in a big
[3:00:08.380 --> 3:00:16.940]  new study that's been put out by major universities. The Diagnostic Statistical Manual looking at
[3:00:16.940 --> 3:00:24.060]  the actual numbers. Journals.sagepub.com that you are many, many, many, many, many times
[3:00:24.060 --> 3:00:29.700]  more likely according to dozens of studies. This is an aggregate right down of being depressed
[3:00:29.700 --> 3:00:36.140]  or committing suicide. If you are a leftist, you're also higher rates of stealing, lying,
[3:00:36.140 --> 3:00:40.460]  virtue signaling. You're nine times more likely to say that you're going to give the charity
[3:00:40.460 --> 3:00:45.420]  but actually don't. So basically you're a fake, you're a fraud. And now I've got reports
[3:00:45.420 --> 3:00:52.060]  here. An 80 plus percent increase in people taking psychotropic drugs during the COVID
[3:00:52.060 --> 3:00:57.660]  lockdown and massive increases in crime. This is what you'd expect. Getting the powder keg
[3:00:57.660 --> 3:01:04.460]  souped up and ready. We're going to have John Lappaport of NoMoreFakeNews.com take over.
[3:01:04.460 --> 3:01:08.340]  Please don't forget that if we don't navigate this properly, we're going to have a supermassive
[3:01:08.340 --> 3:01:11.860]  global meltdown collapse that the globalists want to use for depopulation. We're going
[3:01:11.860 --> 3:01:16.860]  to have a major recession, depression, regardless. Obligate swarable food. Now they're up to
[3:01:16.860 --> 3:01:20.860]  speed. Two weeks, four weeks, five weeks. They said say four weeks. It's actually less
[3:01:20.860 --> 3:01:26.620]  than that on average. Highest quality swarable foods. Very low price. Great packaging. InfoWars.com
[3:01:26.620 --> 3:01:31.420]  now available. You should be getting prepared now. Also, all InfoWars apparel is at cost
[3:01:31.420 --> 3:01:38.420]  $9.95. Some shirts cost us $15. Average shirt costs us like $8 or $9.10. So it's $9.95. Only
[3:01:38.420 --> 3:01:43.100]  did this four years ago during the last election. All shirts at cost. That's a limited time.
[3:01:43.100 --> 3:01:47.380]  Because a lot of these are going to sell out very, very quickly. Also, survival shield
[3:01:47.380 --> 3:01:51.460]  X2, deep earth iodine now in a high quality spray bottle. That's now available. 33% off
[3:01:51.460 --> 3:01:57.100]  out of the gates. And the lowest price ever on Alexa Pure Breeze, four stage ion filters.
[3:01:57.100 --> 3:02:04.140]  They will never do this again. They're actually selling it to us and we're making like $30.
[3:02:04.140 --> 3:02:09.660]  They've taken their profit out, leading competitors like 500 bucks a piece. Because same folks
[3:02:09.660 --> 3:02:14.500]  on my Patreon, same folks sell the Alexa Pure water filtration, which is the highest
[3:02:14.500 --> 3:02:18.540]  study, highest quality out there as well. For whatever reason, people aren't buying air
[3:02:18.540 --> 3:02:22.820]  filtration during this crisis, which is so important for your house. Each big room needs
[3:02:22.820 --> 3:02:27.780]  one, you know, a small house needs a couple of them, big house four, five of them. I've
[3:02:27.780 --> 3:02:29.820]  got them every area of this area. It's ion filter, but it's the first stage you clean
[3:02:29.820 --> 3:02:38.060]  off every month. This is $149.95. And it's because they've got a warehouse full of them.
[3:02:38.060 --> 3:02:43.420]  And they're just giving us the steal. Nobody else has this. It's retails 300 bucks. Infoworkstore.com,
[3:02:43.420 --> 3:02:48.060]  you cannot, this is at cost for them. They're selling it. We make like 30 bucks, get those
[3:02:48.060 --> 3:02:52.540]  limited supply, Alexa Pure Breeze. I think warehouse is like one, they got three containers
[3:02:52.540 --> 3:02:55.660]  of them. And he's wants to get them out of the warehouse. So if you want air filtration,
[3:02:55.660 --> 3:03:01.380]  you can't beat this deal. Infoworkstore.com as well. Okay, John Rappaport is ready to
[3:03:01.380 --> 3:03:08.940]  go. And for the next 48 minutes, he is in charge. No more fake news.com, John.
[3:03:08.940 --> 3:03:14.620]  Thank you, Alex. I give you a name. I want you to remember the name. I want you to write
[3:03:14.620 --> 3:03:20.940]  it down. Think about it because that's what this rest of this hour is all about. Erin,
[3:03:20.940 --> 3:03:31.060]  Marie Olszewski. Erin, Marie Olszewski. A military nurse working at the epicenter of
[3:03:31.060 --> 3:03:39.020]  the epicenter of the epicenter, which is supposed to be New York Elmhurst Hospital, Queens,
[3:03:39.020 --> 3:03:51.820]  where we are told that most people are dying of COVID, COVID, COVID. She's a hero. Okay.
[3:03:51.820 --> 3:03:59.980]  She went undercover in the hospital with video camera, with audio, talking to nurses, talking
[3:03:59.980 --> 3:04:05.540]  to doctors. And she was interviewed at length over an hour and 10 minutes. There she is
[3:04:05.540 --> 3:04:10.220]  on your screen. We've got eight clips. We're going to play them. I'm going to talk about
[3:04:10.220 --> 3:04:18.780]  them. This is a major gigantic smoking gun on what is happening. One piece of background.
[3:04:18.780 --> 3:04:25.540]  July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Barbara Starfield, revered
[3:04:25.540 --> 3:04:31.300]  public health expert at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, published a review, is U.S.
[3:04:31.300 --> 3:04:38.980]  Health the best in the world. In it, she describes the following. Every year in the U.S., medical
[3:04:38.980 --> 3:04:49.780]  treatment in hospitals, including errors and what else would you call it, mistreatment,
[3:04:49.780 --> 3:05:00.140]  result in 119,000 deaths per year, added up per decade. This does not even include deaths
[3:05:00.140 --> 3:05:09.140]  as a result of toxic meds or vaccines. Mistreatment, errors in hospitals. We're going to be talking
[3:05:09.140 --> 3:05:17.900]  about one of these now. Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, New York, supposed to be the epicenter
[3:05:17.900 --> 3:05:23.860]  of the epicenter. Play clip one.
[3:05:23.860 --> 3:05:30.100]  I am pulling up like their laboratory results. So if you look here, you'll see COVID-19
[3:05:30.100 --> 3:05:41.540]  bio reference lab. Here are the test results. As you can see, 51, 2020 at 17, 16, not detected.
[3:05:41.540 --> 3:05:52.660]  The test for a second time, 54, 2020 at 17, 59, not detected. So both of those are negative.
[3:05:52.660 --> 3:06:01.580]  Roll up to the top. This is my patient. They are on event and they are being called COVID-19
[3:06:01.580 --> 3:06:05.540]  confirmed. Droplet in contact and eye protection.
[3:06:05.540 --> 3:06:15.580]  So this person is... Okay, that's clip one. You get it? Labeling people, even the people
[3:06:15.580 --> 3:06:25.700]  who by their own test talked about that before. Negative, negative, no COVID. Mark them COVID.
[3:06:25.700 --> 3:06:33.060]  Stick them on a ventilator. That procedure we will discuss. Very, very dangerous. It's
[3:06:33.060 --> 3:06:38.220]  called murder. Be with you after break.
[3:06:38.220 --> 3:06:43.700]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism. And so populist movements are throwing the
[3:06:43.700 --> 3:06:48.780]  globalist out of their countries. That's why the new world order is instituting race
[3:06:48.780 --> 3:06:54.260]  war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local
[3:06:54.260 --> 3:07:01.260]  police and government and destroying essential services. This is an attempt to have society
[3:07:01.260 --> 3:07:05.420]  collapse and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick
[3:07:05.420 --> 3:07:11.220]  up the pieces. They must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and the EU openly
[3:07:11.220 --> 3:07:15.980]  saying defund the police. The police have a lot of problems. We all have a lot of problems.
[3:07:15.980 --> 3:07:20.260]  But this is our government and our local constabulary. And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown
[3:07:20.260 --> 3:07:24.900]  this country, they are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process
[3:07:24.900 --> 3:07:29.540]  or freedom. The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world. And they
[3:07:29.540 --> 3:07:34.500]  are orchestrating this entire thing. The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots
[3:07:34.500 --> 3:07:41.460]  and must be opposed. info wars dot com. Let's go to one in Connecticut. You're on the air.
[3:07:41.460 --> 3:07:45.060]  Thanks for holding. Hello. Can you hear me? I sure can, sir. Thank you. Hey, Alex. Before
[3:07:45.060 --> 3:07:50.140]  I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right
[3:07:50.140 --> 3:07:55.260]  now. Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother. I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just
[3:07:55.260 --> 3:08:00.700]  want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive. Me
[3:08:00.700 --> 3:08:06.940]  and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[3:08:06.940 --> 3:08:13.700]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla. And I have lost weight because I stopped drinking
[3:08:13.700 --> 3:08:17.660]  all that sugar. And I just want to thank you for that, man. Well, brother, we put more in
[3:08:17.660 --> 3:08:22.980]  this than any other long term high quality energy powder there is. So this this was designed
[3:08:22.980 --> 3:08:25.820]  on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't want his name on it because obviously
[3:08:25.820 --> 3:08:28.740]  the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the
[3:08:28.740 --> 3:08:33.300]  design of it. And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[3:08:33.300 --> 3:08:36.180]  And you're saying that it's made your life better. So that means a lot to me. Thank you
[3:08:36.180 --> 3:08:44.220]  to all your truck drivers. We love you. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:44.220 --> 3:09:04.140]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to the
[3:09:04.140 --> 3:09:32.460]  Alex Jones show. And now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:09:35.100 --> 3:09:41.980]  Video camera in the hospital undercover for an extended period of time, not just once,
[3:09:41.980 --> 3:09:52.780]  audio in the hospital. Basically, while being a nurse, in this incredible scene there at
[3:09:52.780 --> 3:09:58.980]  the hospital, also being an investigative journalist, interviewed on video, the video
[3:09:58.980 --> 3:10:06.540]  is up in several places now. It's a band video. You've got to watch the whole thing an hour
[3:10:06.540 --> 3:10:19.620]  and 10 minutes. I've been doing nothing but since last night. So we established COVID patients
[3:10:19.620 --> 3:10:27.980]  in this hospital. They come in even by conventional tests. They test negative, negative, negative,
[3:10:27.980 --> 3:10:35.700]  but they're coded as COVID-19. What do you know about that? That's what Aaron documented,
[3:10:35.700 --> 3:10:45.020]  showed it in the first clip. What happens then, as she said, put on ventilators. This is very
[3:10:45.020 --> 3:10:51.980]  serious treatment. Como, the governor of New York state, of course, was screaming about
[3:10:51.980 --> 3:10:58.860]  the need for ventilators, ordered 30,000 ventilators. What does he know about medicine, health, healing?
[3:10:58.860 --> 3:11:05.660]  Zero, less than zero. But of course, he's suddenly a medical professional, and he knows
[3:11:05.660 --> 3:11:14.540]  everything. He's also the person who said hydroxychloroquine should never be used, refused
[3:11:14.540 --> 3:11:21.500]  to allow it to be used, finally said, okay, in a desperate situation, you can use it,
[3:11:21.500 --> 3:11:30.980]  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. What's happening at this hospital? Play clip two, reality.
[3:11:30.980 --> 3:11:37.860]  I compare this hospital to a third world country. I've been in a third world country hospital
[3:11:37.860 --> 3:11:43.580]  in Iraq. The Iraq hospital is better than this one. And that says a lot. I've been there.
[3:11:43.580 --> 3:11:50.220]  I've had, I've been in both hospitals. Play clip three.
[3:11:50.220 --> 3:11:55.940]  There are good nurses that work there, too. Like, I have made good friends with a lot
[3:11:55.940 --> 3:12:03.180]  of the nurses that do work there. There's good people, but they're outnumbered.
[3:12:03.180 --> 3:12:08.380]  So what happens? People come in, like, this 37-year-old, and what was he complaining of,
[3:12:08.380 --> 3:12:14.740]  or what was going on? Respiratory distress. He didn't have COVID either. He did not have
[3:12:14.740 --> 3:12:16.380]  COVID. And how do we know that?
[3:12:16.380 --> 3:12:22.340]  I took care of him. I have the same type of results from his chart as I do with my other
[3:12:22.340 --> 3:12:25.900]  patient. It was, like, the day before intubation, he was fine on their own breather.
[3:12:25.900 --> 3:12:30.980]  And then they intubated, and then he got a new mom, and then they went out to have a
[3:12:30.980 --> 3:12:35.100]  joke, and then they went to a church. And now he's 37-years-old and dead.
[3:12:35.100 --> 3:12:42.460]  That's what I'm seeing. Like, all these negative tests, and they're putting them on these
[3:12:42.460 --> 3:12:50.140]  fans, hopeful that they'll get it. They'll be put on these COVID floor. It's murder.
[3:12:50.140 --> 3:12:56.540]  It's straight up is, it is setting these people up for failure based on...
[3:12:56.540 --> 3:13:08.260]  Okay. It's murder. It's murder. They put people on these ventilators that have no reason in
[3:13:08.260 --> 3:13:17.380]  the world to be on the ventilators. As you saw on the screen, young patient developed
[3:13:17.380 --> 3:13:24.420]  pneumonia. That is a serious medical problem that is understood very well in the medical
[3:13:24.420 --> 3:13:31.980]  community to be a problem associated with ventilators. So you don't use ventilators
[3:13:31.980 --> 3:13:40.780]  just casually as they're obviously doing by calling patients a test negative for COVID
[3:13:40.780 --> 3:13:49.860]  positive and putting them on the ventilators and killing them at the epicenter of the epicenter.
[3:13:49.860 --> 3:14:04.220]  It's murder. It's murder. Does the governor know? Does the president know? Does the mayor
[3:14:04.220 --> 3:14:12.380]  of New York know? Does anybody in New York really know what's going on at this hospital?
[3:14:12.380 --> 3:14:18.740]  Does anybody in New York in an official position really, really know what's going on at any
[3:14:18.740 --> 3:14:31.020]  of the hospitals in New York? So at this particular hospital in Elmhurst, they're generally serving
[3:14:31.020 --> 3:14:43.740]  the poor, black, Hispanic populations. What about the elderly? Another quote, demographic.
[3:14:43.740 --> 3:14:48.780]  What about the elderly at this hospital and other hospitals in New York? How are they
[3:14:48.780 --> 3:15:03.260]  dealing with them? Getting the message here, Erin Marie Polzowski. So imagine that you're
[3:15:03.260 --> 3:15:09.900]  a military nurse. You serve tours in Iraq as she has. You come back to the States. You're
[3:15:09.900 --> 3:15:21.740]  working, I think originally, Michigan, Florida, now up to New York. Okay. Suddenly, you're
[3:15:21.740 --> 3:15:29.860]  in the middle of this dire, incredible situation that you recognize is like being, it's worse
[3:15:29.860 --> 3:15:38.900]  than the hospitals that you worked in in Iraq. What are you going to do? You're there. You're
[3:15:38.900 --> 3:15:44.020]  going to walk away. You're going to try to talk to people. She does that. You'll see,
[3:15:44.020 --> 3:15:51.100]  if you watch the entire video, she talks to a doctor in the hospital, engages him in dialogue.
[3:15:51.100 --> 3:15:59.020]  His answers are quite revealing. And I would say typical and cold-blooded as to what to
[3:15:59.020 --> 3:16:09.020]  do, what can't be done, the attitude, and so on and so forth. What does she decide to do?
[3:16:09.020 --> 3:16:14.700]  Erin Marie Polzowski. She decides to expose everything that's going on and laying it out
[3:16:14.700 --> 3:16:23.020]  to the public and to any public officials that want to know what exactly is happening.
[3:16:23.020 --> 3:16:24.020]  Play the next clip.
[3:16:24.020 --> 3:16:30.020]  Because they're all scared. Everybody's scared. And everybody's scared to stick up for themselves.
[3:16:30.020 --> 3:16:37.020]  And I've called a lot of doctors unethical to their face, and they deserve it.
[3:16:37.020 --> 3:16:49.020]  Falling doctors unethical to their face, and they deserve it. You would think that when
[3:16:49.020 --> 3:16:57.020]  there's this explosion of people dying in this one area of Queens, New York, that somebody
[3:16:57.020 --> 3:17:07.020]  is going to say, maybe we should look at the hospital. Not just what's happening out there
[3:17:07.020 --> 3:17:13.020]  before they get to the hospital. How about we look at the hospital? Why don't we go inside
[3:17:13.020 --> 3:17:22.020]  the hospital and find out what they're really doing to patients there? That's what this nurse did.
[3:17:22.020 --> 3:17:29.020]  That's what is happening. She deserves every amount of support we can give her because
[3:17:29.020 --> 3:17:37.020]  she's put herself at great risk in many ways. Be back after the break. Don't go anywhere.
[3:17:37.020 --> 3:17:44.020]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.

[3:21:00.020 --> 3:21:06.020]  It's the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:21:06.020 --> 3:21:33.020]  Okay, we're back here. We're talking about Aaron Marie Olszewski, military nurse, Elmhurst
[3:21:33.020 --> 3:21:41.020]  Hospital Queens, New York, who has gone undercover in the hospital with video, with audio, talking
[3:21:41.020 --> 3:21:47.020]  freely about everything that's going on in that hospital where people are being killed.
[3:21:47.020 --> 3:21:55.020]  It's murder. Play clip four.
[3:21:55.020 --> 3:22:03.020]  They're all scared. Everybody's scared, and everybody's scared to stick up for themselves,
[3:22:03.020 --> 3:22:08.020]  and I've called a lot of doctors unethical to their face, and they deserve it.
[3:22:08.020 --> 3:22:10.020]  Okay, go on to the next clip.
[3:22:10.020 --> 3:22:27.020]  This is in the United States, and this hospital is treating low-income, mostly, people, and it almost makes me feel like they think these people are disposable,
[3:22:27.020 --> 3:22:35.020]  and they're not. They're people. People are not disposable.
[3:22:35.020 --> 3:22:49.020]  Especially the ones that are struggling, day in and day out, the hard workers, trying to reach that American dream,
[3:22:49.020 --> 3:22:55.020]  and they're not giving a chance because they're brought to this place where nobody cares.
[3:22:55.020 --> 3:23:02.020]  And is there an understood financial incentive to diagnose COVID?
[3:23:02.020 --> 3:23:09.020]  Yeah, of course. So in the hospital that I'm in right now, it's all COVID at this point.
[3:23:09.020 --> 3:23:18.020]  It's all COVID. Financial incentive to diagnose people with COVID.
[3:23:18.020 --> 3:23:23.020]  Their own tests are negative. They're diagnosed with COVID. And again, what does that mean?
[3:23:23.020 --> 3:23:37.020]  It isn't just a game they're playing to get money. It is that because the insurance payouts, as I've described before, are considerably higher when you have a patient come into the hospital and there's diagnosis COVID.
[3:23:37.020 --> 3:23:52.020]  We understand that. We're talking about something a lot more serious than that for the patient, which is they're put on a train from the point of the diagnosis in this hospital onto ventilators.
[3:23:52.020 --> 3:24:01.020]  Highly risky procedure. It's not just, I'll put them on event. No.
[3:24:01.020 --> 3:24:14.020]  The people that are working these things have to know exactly what they're doing, have to be doing it for exactly the right reason with the individual patient if absolutely necessary.
[3:24:14.020 --> 3:24:23.020]  This is not a one size fits all, as the nurse Erin describes here at some point in the video.
[3:24:23.020 --> 3:24:35.020]  And as you'll see, because we're leading up to this, there will be a section here where it's much worse than just the ventilator.
[3:24:35.020 --> 3:24:46.020]  There's more involved on this train to death and nowhere than just being put on a ventilator, which itself is dangerous enough.
[3:24:46.020 --> 3:24:59.020]  Using the wrong protocol, too much pressure on the lungs, collapsing the lungs, destroying the patient's life, et cetera, pneumonia that leads to death, et cetera, et cetera, from the ventilator.
[3:24:59.020 --> 3:25:07.020]  But there's even more, and I want to make sure that we get all this in. So go to the next clip.
[3:25:07.020 --> 3:25:11.020]  There is in here, you know, I guess the word traveled after this.
[3:25:11.020 --> 3:25:22.020]  You mentioned earlier that this is a common occurrence where people come in able to speak and they just have low oxygen levels and then they're put on event.
[3:25:22.020 --> 3:25:29.020]  So what's going on there?
[3:25:29.020 --> 3:25:39.020]  I don't know. I honestly, I have no idea how they're assuming everybody is just the same. There's no individuality anymore.
[3:25:39.020 --> 3:25:49.020]  These residents, I think a lot of them are just stone cold, you know, there's no emotion, and they don't view people as people anymore.
[3:25:49.020 --> 3:25:59.020]  And it's really sad, like, I came a little bit later, you know, after the big rush, but there was still a lot of people coming in, and a lot of us were just in shock.
[3:25:59.020 --> 3:26:03.020]  Within the first couple days, you could see exactly what was going on.
[3:26:03.020 --> 3:26:13.020]  My bigger problem with this whole scenario is when they intimate people who don't need it, and it looks very clear to me that they're just pushing it.
[3:26:13.020 --> 3:26:19.020]  You almost feel like you're literally living in the Twilight Zone.
[3:26:19.020 --> 3:26:29.020]  Living in this Twilight Zone, intubating people that don't need it, meaning putting them on ventilators, when they absolutely don't need it.
[3:26:29.020 --> 3:26:38.020]  It's murder. Who cares in New York? Who really cares in New York?
[3:26:38.020 --> 3:26:48.020]  I'll tell you something else. I've also, I believe, reported this on another episode here on InfoWars.
[3:26:48.020 --> 3:26:54.020]  A trusted emergency room doctor, not at this hospital, another hospital, said,
[3:26:54.020 --> 3:27:04.020]  One of the things that these doctors now don't realize is that many elderly people live with chronically low levels of oxygen.
[3:27:04.020 --> 3:27:09.020]  Is it optimal? No. Do they survive? Yes.
[3:27:09.020 --> 3:27:22.020]  It's just what is happening to them as they get older, as they get diagnosed, of course, with multiple conditions and are treated with toxic drugs, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:27:22.020 --> 3:27:26.020]  Yes. They survive.
[3:27:26.020 --> 3:27:44.020]  But they come to a hospital like this, which, as Aaron says, the residents there, they're not working like true professionals that are really competent and understand from experience what's going on.
[3:27:44.020 --> 3:27:52.020]  So what does low oxygen in a patient look like to them in an elderly patient? Put them on a ventilator. Put them on a ventilator.
[3:27:52.020 --> 3:28:07.020]  Put them on the train that leads to the ventilator, that leads to pneumonia, that leads to wrong protocol, that leads to too much pressure, that leads to collapsing of lungs, that leads to pneumonia, that leads to death.
[3:28:07.020 --> 3:28:19.020]  Put them on that train because he's an old or she's an old person who has chronically low levels of oxygen but manages to survive year to year, decade to decade to decade,
[3:28:19.020 --> 3:28:30.020]  but they don't recognize that. They don't see that. They don't know that. They have no clue who is educating these people, who is responsible for that,
[3:28:30.020 --> 3:28:44.020]  and where are the investigations of all the hospitals in New York dealing with all the people and what is really going on in these hospitals, not just in Elmhurst.
[3:28:44.020 --> 3:28:46.020]  Play the next clip.
[3:28:46.020 --> 3:28:50.020]  What killed him? Did the vent kill him?
[3:28:50.020 --> 3:28:59.020]  Yeah, oh yes. They're so sedated. He had probably eight or nine drips. It's all sedation. It's all sedation and paralytics.
[3:28:59.020 --> 3:29:10.020]  So you are asleep. It is essentially like you're under, you know, you're in surgery, you know, and they put you under like that for a good month straight.
[3:29:10.020 --> 3:29:18.020]  There's no way you can recover from something like that. You're being brain dead if you do.
[3:29:18.020 --> 3:29:32.020]  That's the key clip. That's the key clip right there. That's the one that needs to be expanded, elucidated, explained, stressed, laid out in full.
[3:29:32.020 --> 3:29:43.020]  What she's talking about there is not just the fake COVID diagnosis leading on the train to the ventilator.
[3:29:43.020 --> 3:29:52.020]  And she's not just talking about the patient being given a light muscle relaxer while on the ventilator.
[3:29:52.020 --> 3:29:55.020]  Play that clip again.
[3:29:55.020 --> 3:29:59.020]  What killed him? Did the vent kill him?
[3:29:59.020 --> 3:30:08.020]  Yeah, oh yes. They're so sedated. He had probably eight or nine drips. It's all sedation. It's all sedation and paralytics.
[3:30:08.020 --> 3:30:19.020]  So you are asleep. It is essentially like you're under, you know, you're in surgery, you know, and they put you under like that for a good month straight.
[3:30:19.020 --> 3:30:25.020]  There's no way you can recover from something like that. You're being brain dead if you do.
[3:30:25.020 --> 3:30:34.020]  We'll explain that detail after the break. Stay with us here on InfoWars.
[3:30:55.020 --> 3:31:00.020]  We got it in the dropper. It's great at your house. It's, you know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[3:31:00.020 --> 3:31:08.020]  It's great to keep with you. And again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[3:31:08.020 --> 3:31:11.020]  We're really excited about it. It's 33% off out of the gates.
[3:31:11.020 --> 3:31:23.020]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way.
[3:31:23.020 --> 3:31:34.020]  Get your survival shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[3:31:34.020 --> 3:31:54.020]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[3:31:54.020 --> 3:31:56.020]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[3:31:56.020 --> 3:32:08.020]  I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war. It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[3:32:08.020 --> 3:32:22.020]  The globalists are attacking on every front. That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor info wars off here because they knew that when they watched this whole situation that they did want the people's voice to still be on air.
[3:32:22.020 --> 3:32:34.020]  Thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air. So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now, more than ever, info wars.com lives.
[3:32:53.020 --> 3:33:04.020]  With an end game to depopulate the planet, now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized. You must decide which side you're on.
[3:33:04.020 --> 3:33:13.020]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally death.
[3:33:13.020 --> 3:33:20.020]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death. The delusions must end now.
[3:33:20.020 --> 3:33:26.020]  Info wars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[3:33:26.020 --> 3:33:53.020]  Most people that are aware of the new order decide to join it out of fear. They are truly fools. We must fight this or lose our souls.
[3:33:57.020 --> 3:34:10.020]  And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[3:34:10.020 --> 3:34:16.020]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face. It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[3:34:16.020 --> 3:34:20.020]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[3:34:20.020 --> 3:34:30.020]  So, this is a real innovation. I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out. It smells great.
[3:34:30.020 --> 3:34:51.020]  It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[3:34:51.020 --> 3:35:09.020]  John Rafferport back here, the last segment of this hour. Okay. What you saw in the clip just before we took a break there was it's not just a ventilator.
[3:35:09.020 --> 3:35:22.020]  It's a ventilator plus heavy, heavy, heavy sedatives. She was talking about somebody who was on eight or nine different drugs.
[3:35:22.020 --> 3:35:33.020]  They put you to sleep on the ventilator for a long period. That's what she was saying. You don't wake up.
[3:35:33.020 --> 3:35:48.020]  How do you like that kind of death? Somebody, just negative even on their own tests for COVID, comes in the hospital, maybe has low oxygen level, whatever.
[3:35:48.020 --> 3:36:03.020]  Oh, it must put them on a ventilator. Put them on the train to the ventilator, to the effects that I've indicated earlier in the segment, pneumonia, et cetera, et cetera, wrong protocol, lung collapse, et cetera, whatever.
[3:36:03.020 --> 3:36:21.020]  A sedative, massive sedation. The person never wakes up under a ventilator sedated, isolated, no friends, no family permitted, dies.
[3:36:21.020 --> 3:36:34.020]  You're the mayor of New York, de Blasio. If you were the governor of New York, Como, wouldn't you be interested in knowing how often that happens in your city and your state? Wouldn't you be interested?
[3:36:34.020 --> 3:36:47.020]  Wouldn't you demand that this be discussed and investigated and prosecuted? Wouldn't you? What about you reporters in New York?
[3:36:47.020 --> 3:37:02.020]  Don't you think this is a story? Don't you think you should be camping out in that hospital and at the governor's office and the mayor's office demanding for once in your life demanding that you get answers,
[3:37:02.020 --> 3:37:18.020]  that you want to know what's happening and why this is happening on the train to death in the epicenter of the epicenter? Don't you think that might be important enough to get up off your ass every day and do the job that you're supposed to be doing
[3:37:18.020 --> 3:37:35.020]  as a reporter and a journalist, much less a governor and a mayor instead of harassing your own citizens and driving them to despair by insisting on massive lockdowns when lockdowns are absurd and counterproductive,
[3:37:35.020 --> 3:37:54.020]  and you know it by now and you're lying through your teeth all the time, all day, all night, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Governor, don't you think it's time to lay it out and speak the truth for once in your life?
[3:37:54.020 --> 3:38:20.020]  Even if it involves admitting what you did when you insisted Como, there had to be 30,000 ventilators immediately put into New York when you said that hydroxychloroquine could not be used except in the very late stages and so on and so forth.
[3:38:20.020 --> 3:38:35.020]  Or are you just going to sit there and let's just all play out the endless amounts of economic destruction, the health destruction? Play the next clip.
[3:38:35.020 --> 3:38:50.020]  The same reason they won't use other treatments that are successful around the world and I had a conversation with a doctor about this. Are you guys doing different sorts of treatments?
[3:38:50.020 --> 3:39:03.020]  Nothing works. Yeah, but they're coming out with different things that are in the testing. It's the same thing they come with a platform that kill more people than actually save, so that's one.
[3:39:03.020 --> 3:39:14.020]  He said that they don't work anyway and I told him, well, obviously what you guys haven't gone on here isn't working, so what's the harm in trying?
[3:39:14.020 --> 3:39:18.020]  I don't expect any of these people to survive. 90% of them would die.
[3:39:18.020 --> 3:39:24.020]  I mean, it's just maintaining, so I figured if it's assumed they're going to die anyway, just try not to throw a few.
[3:39:24.020 --> 3:39:33.020]  It's, you know, I don't know, that's always an issue in medicine whether they're dying anyway or not.
[3:39:33.020 --> 3:39:40.020]  But if you could find a cure, well, there's no cure, so there's no antiviral therapy, the only way to do it is cure.
[3:39:40.020 --> 3:39:43.020]  Or treatment, I should say, rephrase, treatment.
[3:39:43.020 --> 3:39:50.020]  You could treat it, but you know, it has some scientific basis for whether these things are working or not.
[3:39:50.020 --> 3:39:54.020]  If you don't get them, you could make them worse. So, you know.
[3:39:54.020 --> 3:39:56.020]  Worse than death?
[3:39:56.020 --> 3:39:59.020]  Well, we said 90% maybe, the 10% maybe.
[3:39:59.020 --> 3:40:01.020]  Maybe they're true, I don't know.
[3:40:01.020 --> 3:40:08.020]  But I mean, if there's no basis for it working, I mean, you wouldn't just try things just because.
[3:40:08.020 --> 3:40:09.020]  I would.
[3:40:09.020 --> 3:40:11.020]  You could save my life?
[3:40:14.020 --> 3:40:18.020]  She says, I would try to save my life.
[3:40:18.020 --> 3:40:22.020]  And you'll see when you watch the entire video at Band Video.
[3:40:22.020 --> 3:40:26.020]  She's talking about hydroxychloroquine plus zinc.
[3:40:26.020 --> 3:40:33.020]  She's talking about injections or IV of high-dose vitamin C.
[3:40:33.020 --> 3:40:39.020]  She mentions this to the doctor, the study that was done, he just passes it off of no concern.
[3:40:39.020 --> 3:40:41.020]  What do we care?
[3:40:41.020 --> 3:40:45.020]  And she's saying, well, why not try something if death is the alternative?
[3:40:45.020 --> 3:40:50.020]  Don't you think a rational or sane doctor would say, well, yeah, let's try something.
[3:40:50.020 --> 3:40:56.020]  Because we know the alternative is something called death.
[3:40:56.020 --> 3:40:59.020]  But no. No.
[3:40:59.020 --> 3:41:02.020]  No. What difference does it make? What use is it?
[3:41:02.020 --> 3:41:04.020]  This is a doctor.
[3:41:04.020 --> 3:41:08.020]  This is actually a healer of some kind.
[3:41:08.020 --> 3:41:15.020]  Not any kind that I've ever known about. It's actually a healer.
[3:41:15.020 --> 3:41:21.020]  With that attitude, it sounds very dangerous, in fact, to me.
[3:41:21.020 --> 3:41:26.020]  Extremely dangerous. Extremely dangerous.
[3:41:26.020 --> 3:41:32.020]  You've got to watch the entire one-hour, 10-minute video.
[3:41:32.020 --> 3:41:39.020]  Erin Marie Polzuski, military nurse.
[3:41:39.020 --> 3:41:47.020]  Been a nurse for many years in the military, in civilian life.
[3:41:47.020 --> 3:41:50.020]  Goes to the epicenter of the epicenter.
[3:41:50.020 --> 3:42:01.020]  And eventually, because she's horrified at what she's seen, decides to do something that very few people would do while still working there.
[3:42:01.020 --> 3:42:06.020]  A camera in her glasses.
[3:42:06.020 --> 3:42:10.020]  Undercover, day after day. Audio, video.
[3:42:10.020 --> 3:42:17.020]  Gathering information. And then having that interview.
[3:42:17.020 --> 3:42:21.020]  And just laying it out there completely as to what's happening.
[3:42:21.020 --> 3:42:26.020]  The whole story.
[3:42:26.020 --> 3:42:30.020]  Not many people would do that.
[3:42:30.020 --> 3:42:37.020]  There's every possible support that we can give.
[3:42:37.020 --> 3:42:41.020]  It's just amazing. Just amazing.
[3:42:41.020 --> 3:42:45.020]  I don't know what else to say about it.
[3:42:45.020 --> 3:42:49.020]  It's all laid out.
[3:42:49.020 --> 3:42:52.020]  Where are the public health authorities in New York?
[3:42:52.020 --> 3:42:55.020]  Instead of yammering about this and that.
[3:42:55.020 --> 3:42:59.020]  And you've got to worry about the mask and you have to keep the distance.
[3:42:59.020 --> 3:43:15.020]  When the health agencies themselves even admit and mainstream people who are educated in that kind of science epidemiology readily say,
[3:43:15.020 --> 3:43:18.020]  this whole thing has been completely politicized.
[3:43:18.020 --> 3:43:22.020]  Fauci is just a frontman.
[3:43:22.020 --> 3:43:27.020]  Why is he there being the spokesman for the epidemic?
[3:43:27.020 --> 3:43:30.020]  Why? Because he's on television. That's why.
[3:43:30.020 --> 3:43:33.020]  Because he wormed his way up to that position.
[3:43:33.020 --> 3:43:38.020]  Has nothing to do with knowledge or science or credentials.
[3:43:38.020 --> 3:43:42.020]  You know, some idiot like this interviews him and this idiot talks.
[3:43:42.020 --> 3:43:47.020]  And everybody watches on television and suddenly, I love Fauci. Is he wonderful?
[3:43:47.020 --> 3:43:49.020]  He's the only guy that makes any sense.
[3:43:49.020 --> 3:43:56.020]  Yeah, that's because you're deranged that you think he makes sense.
[3:43:56.020 --> 3:44:00.020]  And having somebody that actually makes sense.
[3:44:00.020 --> 3:44:03.020]  Look up Scott Atlas.
[3:44:03.020 --> 3:44:07.020]  California. He makes a degree of sense.
[3:44:07.020 --> 3:44:13.020]  Look up the leaked German study out of the interior ministry that said the whole thing is a false alarm.
[3:44:13.020 --> 3:44:18.020]  Even within the conventional picture of this whole epidemic.
[3:44:18.020 --> 3:44:28.020]  With all of the focus being on the lockdown, which means the destruction of human life and destruction of economies, which is the purpose behind the whole thing.
[3:44:28.020 --> 3:44:38.020]  To bring on the vaccine and to destroy economies and to create the new normal for everybody and never go back to the way it was.
[3:44:38.020 --> 3:44:42.020]  There's murder happening in New York.
[3:44:42.020 --> 3:44:51.020]  There is murder happening in New York hospital, Governor Como de Blasio, public health authorities.
[3:44:51.020 --> 3:44:54.020]  Find it.
[3:44:54.020 --> 3:45:00.020]  People are not going to be appointed by those idiots to do a real investigation.
[3:45:00.020 --> 3:45:05.020]  You're going to have to do it yourself and find out what's really happening.
[3:45:05.020 --> 3:45:08.020]  Watch the video. Watch the whole thing.
[3:45:08.020 --> 3:45:14.020]  I played eight clips here. You've got a flavor of what this is about. There's a lot more.
[3:45:14.020 --> 3:45:17.020]  Thank you, Aaron. Appreciate your work.
[3:45:17.020 --> 3:45:20.020]  Stay well.
[3:45:20.020 --> 3:45:41.020]  See you next time here on InForward.
