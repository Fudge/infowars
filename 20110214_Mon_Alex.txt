[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:30.400]  we're live it's Monday February 14th 2011 it's the Alex Jones show I'm Paul
[00:30.400 --> 00:35.040]  Joseph Watson and I'll be filling in for Alex today and coming up later we've
[00:35.040 --> 00:40.000]  got Aaron Dykes live in studio and Aaron's gonna guide you through the show
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.280]  after I leave what's going on in the world today well revolution continues to
[00:46.280 --> 00:52.640]  sweep the globe as the kaleidoscope of the New World Order remains in a flux
[00:52.640 --> 00:58.880]  but unlike Glenn Beck and the rest of the neocons who are busy ringing their
[00:58.880 --> 01:03.680]  hands trying to make sense of these revolutions and what they could lead to
[01:03.680 --> 01:12.360]  we have of course Tunisia Egypt and now Algeria experiencing similar unrest but
[01:12.360 --> 01:17.280]  unlike Glenn Beck we're gonna tell you who's really behind radical Islam and
[01:17.280 --> 01:23.120]  why it's being used as a weapon against people of every color and creed we're
[01:23.120 --> 01:29.040]  also going to explain why Ron Paul should feel honored to have been kicked
[01:29.040 --> 01:34.640]  out of the Young Americans for Freedom organization we've also got the move
[01:34.640 --> 01:39.360]  towards global currency heating up the global revolution that's sweeping the
[01:39.360 --> 01:45.120]  planet it's all coming up in today's show but first to Egypt where the
[01:45.120 --> 01:50.040]  military has taken control of the country of course after President Hosni
[01:50.040 --> 01:56.600]  Mubarak's resignation on Friday reports out of the Jerusalem Post now suggests
[01:56.600 --> 02:01.880]  that Mubarak is in a coma having collapsed following his speech on Friday
[02:01.880 --> 02:07.200]  that's yet to be confirmed what strange reports coming out about that and of
[02:07.200 --> 02:12.040]  course today the military has announced that it has suspended the Egyptian
[02:12.040 --> 02:18.120]  Constitution is banning strikes and it's telling the Egyptian protesters to
[02:18.120 --> 02:26.280]  leave Tigia Square meet the new boss same as the old boss and of course as we've
[02:26.280 --> 02:30.480]  explained in depth on the Alex Jones show the global elite have several
[02:30.480 --> 02:36.760]  pawns on standby ready to assume power and hijack the people's revolution that
[02:36.760 --> 02:43.120]  hasn't folded there in Egypt of course El Berardi chief amongst them they have
[02:43.120 --> 02:49.560]  several others waiting to sweep in and hijack the revolution Egypt's new
[02:49.560 --> 02:55.640]  military regime to effectively outlaw strikes this is out of Reuters Cairo
[02:55.640 --> 03:00.600]  Egypt's new military rulers will issue a warning on Monday against anyone who
[03:00.600 --> 03:06.000]  creates quote chaos and disorder an army source said the higher military
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.720]  council will also ban meetings by labor unions or professional syndicates
[03:10.720 --> 03:16.400]  effectively forbidding strikes and tell all Egyptians to get back to work after
[03:16.400 --> 03:23.240]  the unrest that toppled Hosni Mubarak so the higher military council is on the
[03:23.240 --> 03:27.160]  one hand saying they will allow protests and yet on the other telling all the
[03:27.160 --> 03:33.800]  protesters to go home so we've got a situation whereby you know they've
[03:33.800 --> 03:38.480]  turfed out the 30-year dictator Mubarak and now they've basically got a
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.880]  military dictatorship in his place obviously they say it's gonna gonna be
[03:43.880 --> 03:48.680]  temporary we're talking about six months until the election but they're gonna
[03:48.680 --> 03:56.040]  have a raft of New World Order approved candidates to take Mubarak's place now
[03:56.040 --> 04:01.400]  that's not to belittle the legitimate grievances of the Egyptian people which
[04:01.400 --> 04:06.200]  we've explained at length here on the Alex Jones show and it's not to downplay
[04:06.200 --> 04:11.760]  the victory that they indeed have had in getting rid of Mubarak the 30-year
[04:11.760 --> 04:18.800]  unelected dictator the fact is Egyptians were living on $2 a day they
[04:18.800 --> 04:25.280]  were spending 40% of their income on food food prices skyrocketed and that was
[04:25.280 --> 04:29.720]  one of the straws that broke the camel's back as well of course as soaring
[04:29.720 --> 04:35.280]  unemployment so to say that this was a completely staged and contrived color
[04:35.280 --> 04:41.240]  revolution from the very beginning is a kind of disservice to the more nuanced
[04:41.240 --> 04:47.040]  reality of the situation which will we will explore in further detail after the
[04:47.040 --> 05:01.120]  break on the Alex Jones show so stay tuned it's prisonplanet.tv don't go away

[07:00.760 --> 07:04.520]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[07:04.520 --> 07:08.280]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[07:08.280 --> 07:12.800]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[07:12.800 --> 07:17.000]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.640]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[07:21.640 --> 07:25.640]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[07:25.640 --> 07:29.760]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[07:29.760 --> 07:33.720]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[07:33.720 --> 07:37.880]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[07:37.880 --> 07:41.680]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[07:41.680 --> 07:45.200]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[08:00.920 --> 08:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.000 --> 08:19.520]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[08:19.520 --> 08:23.240]  alex jones
[08:23.240 --> 08:29.480]  Paul Joseph Watson sitting in for alex jones on this live broadcast and we're
[08:29.480 --> 08:35.480]  talking about the revolution of course they're in Egypt now this uprising could
[08:35.480 --> 08:40.320]  not have occurred of course without the causative factors of unemployment and
[08:40.320 --> 08:46.080]  soaring food costs but that doesn't mean for a second that the globalists
[08:46.080 --> 08:50.720]  weren't prepared from the outset to hijack this revolution and turn it
[08:50.720 --> 08:56.040]  towards their own ends indeed we know that the US Embassy as early as
[08:56.040 --> 09:02.080]  December 2008 had its informants telling them that there was unrest which would
[09:02.080 --> 09:08.160]  most likely lead to a revolution in Egypt in the year 2011 they put it down
[09:08.160 --> 09:15.760]  exactly to the precise year similarly in Tunisia with the Ben Ali regime as far
[09:15.760 --> 09:22.320]  back as 2006 the CIA were given the indication that an overthrow was
[09:22.320 --> 09:27.900]  possible over the next few years and that's exactly what happened so we saw
[09:27.900 --> 09:34.960]  this play out when it was first on the news in Egypt for about a week and while
[09:34.960 --> 09:41.440]  this happened that the pied pipers of the neocons slash tea party movement the
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.560]  hijacked republican distortion of it that is for about a week they had no
[09:46.560 --> 09:52.120]  idea how to fit the scenes we were seeing in out of Egypt into their
[09:52.120 --> 09:57.960]  manipulative left-right paradigm indeed one of the first things that happened
[09:57.960 --> 10:04.120]  when the riots started in Egypt was for Vice President Joe Biden to come out
[10:04.120 --> 10:10.320]  and basically lend his support to Mubarak the sitting dictator and that
[10:10.320 --> 10:15.960]  gave the indication that the Obama administration was against the protesters
[10:15.960 --> 10:23.600]  so the neocons didn't know you know on which side to come down on this the
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.720]  Obama administration was seemingly you know pro-mubarak and against the
[10:27.720 --> 10:34.800]  protesters but to praise the site of thousands of rioting Muslims 90% of
[10:34.800 --> 10:41.600]  Egyptians are Muslims just didn't sit comfortably with people who are trying to
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.720]  sell this idea of a clash of civilizations which people like Glenn Beck and
[10:46.720 --> 10:55.520]  the rest of the neocontalk show hosts are and while they're trying to sell this
[10:55.520 --> 11:02.960]  they're simultaneously ignoring the glaringly obvious fact the manifestly
[11:02.960 --> 11:10.040]  provable fact the radical Islam which they now fear will take over Egypt is a
[11:10.040 --> 11:15.200]  creature of the US military industrial complex not only from its inception with
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.840]  the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood the Wahabi Muslims in Egypt and also
[11:20.840 --> 11:29.920]  al-Qaeda to fight the Soviets in 79 but continuing to the present day so we put
[11:29.920 --> 11:33.000]  out an article on Saturday which talked about this and we're gonna have Aaron on
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.920]  the show later today to discuss it in greater depth but Glenn Beck and I caught
[11:38.920 --> 11:42.600]  his show on Friday and this is not about an obsession with Glenn Beck they're
[11:42.600 --> 11:47.320]  all saying it this is the tax that they've taken this is the line that
[11:47.320 --> 11:53.360]  they followed in the aftermath of this revolution Glenn Beck certainly on his
[11:53.360 --> 12:02.560]  Friday radio show and television show is busy saying that the aftermath of the
[12:02.560 --> 12:07.800]  revolution in Egypt will allow the Muslim Brotherhood to basically unite
[12:07.800 --> 12:15.000]  with global communism and global anarchism to advance the New World Order
[12:15.000 --> 12:24.160]  now Glenn Beck has no idea the radical Islam in and of itself was created by
[12:24.160 --> 12:27.960]  the New World Order or the US military industrial complex if you prefer and
[12:27.960 --> 12:34.560]  continues to be fostered and fomented provoked financed and funded by those
[12:34.560 --> 12:40.160]  same very forces so Beck is saying that it's a huge Muslim Brotherhood
[12:40.160 --> 12:46.560]  communist conspiracy which threatens the West without telling you that the
[12:46.560 --> 12:51.600]  radical Islamic threat is a mere tool a mere creation of the globalist that's
[12:51.600 --> 12:56.640]  going to be used as a weapon against us all what Glenn Beck won't tell you is
[12:56.640 --> 13:01.640]  the fact that the Islamic Wahabi in Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood that's now
[13:01.640 --> 13:06.200]  going to have a big say in these elections in six months established an
[13:06.200 --> 13:11.200]  alliance with and was heavily funded by the CIA at the same time that the CIA
[13:11.200 --> 13:20.360]  began its relationship with one Osama bin Laden now Beck is always on about how
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.760]  Islamic fundamentalism is being indoctrinated into the younger generation
[13:24.760 --> 13:31.680]  around the world those very doctrine Asian centers for radical Islam were set
[13:31.680 --> 13:36.880]  up at the same time with the aid of the Wahabi Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood
[13:36.880 --> 13:44.120]  again by the CIA at the same time that they were financing bin Laden it's a
[13:44.120 --> 13:50.360]  matter of historical facts and yet Glenn Beck never is able to put his
[13:50.360 --> 13:55.040]  finger on the pulse about who is truly behind this so-called Islamic threat
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.480]  which is not to say that it isn't a threat of course it's a threat because
[13:58.480 --> 14:04.360]  it's heavily financed by the US military industrial complex which you know is not
[14:04.360 --> 14:12.160]  an insufficient ally to have so Beck spends his entire Friday show basically
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.600]  in his TV show spinning connections between fundamentalist Muslims
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.520]  communist anarchists while never mentioning once the fact that Islamic
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.800]  fundamentalism and the threat of radical Islam and of course it's a media
[14:27.800 --> 14:33.200]  expression terrorism was not only founded by the CIA but continues to be
[14:33.200 --> 14:39.080]  contrived provoked financed and funded by the US military industrial complex to
[14:39.080 --> 14:45.080]  this day and again Beck's right to make the assertion that radical Islam is a
[14:45.080 --> 14:48.920]  threat but that's because it's been so heavily supported by the US military
[14:48.920 --> 14:54.600]  industrial complex which is the crucial part Beck is claiming that the New
[14:54.600 --> 14:59.720]  World Order is a combination of radical Islam communists and anarchists you know
[14:59.720 --> 15:06.480]  people like Van Jones and the rest of them when in reality all of these groups
[15:06.480 --> 15:10.480]  are merely tools that have been manipulated by the New World Order which
[15:10.480 --> 15:16.520]  is above them all and controls them all and how do I know this because every
[15:16.520 --> 15:22.720]  single major terror plot that has been blamed on radical Islam specifically in
[15:22.720 --> 15:28.200]  the United States has been contrived by the US military industrial complex and
[15:28.200 --> 15:34.240]  my article this morning on prisonplanet.com and it's still the top story
[15:34.240 --> 15:39.960]  proves this case by case terrorists who trained London bombers was working for
[15:39.960 --> 15:46.800]  the US government and this is a London Guardian report about Mohammed
[15:46.800 --> 15:54.800]  Junaid Babar who set up the terrorist training camp in Pakistan in 2003 at
[15:54.800 --> 16:01.240]  which the alleged ringleader of the 7-7 bombings in London Mohammed Sidi Khan
[16:01.240 --> 16:11.240]  learned his bomb-making techniques and now a New York judge after this Babar
[16:11.240 --> 16:16.640]  character admitted to five counts of terrorism including aiding the ringleader
[16:16.640 --> 16:23.360]  of the London bombings a New York judge reduced his 70 year sentence to less
[16:23.360 --> 16:30.960]  than five years and he's now free. Graham Fox a magistrate whose 22 year old son
[16:30.960 --> 16:37.080]  was whose 22 year old son David was killed by Khan at the Edgware Road
[16:37.080 --> 16:42.400]  underground station in 2005 he was a victim of the bombings said quote
[16:42.400 --> 16:46.200]  people get four and a half years for burglary they can get more for some
[16:46.200 --> 16:50.520]  road traffic offences so for an international terrorist who's directly
[16:50.520 --> 16:56.000]  linked to the death of my son and dozens and dozens of other people to get
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.960]  that sentence is just outrageous so why is he being released after four and a
[17:01.960 --> 17:09.200]  half years well it turns out that mr. Mohammed Junaid Babar was working for
[17:09.200 --> 17:13.720]  the US government as an informant not only after the London bombings and after
[17:13.720 --> 17:21.360]  his arrest in 2004 but before that when he was busy training the ringleader of
[17:21.360 --> 17:25.920]  7-7 on how to make bombs that's right he was working for the US government at
[17:25.920 --> 17:34.640]  the same time coincidence I wonder and also remember the fact that Haroon
[17:34.640 --> 17:39.840]  Rashid Aswat who was the so-called mastermind behind the bombers was a
[17:39.840 --> 17:47.120]  British intelligence asset as revealed by terrorist expert John Loftus who
[17:47.120 --> 17:52.480]  pointed out that Aswat was part of the Kosovo group that was being financed and
[17:52.480 --> 17:59.080]  controlled by the CIA back in the mid 90s so he was another client of the
[17:59.080 --> 18:05.800]  Central Intelligence Agency just as it appears that Mohammed Junaid Babar was
[18:05.800 --> 18:10.840]  prior to the London bombings when he was training the lead bomber the alleged
[18:10.840 --> 18:16.880]  lead bomber to cut the bomb he was working for the US government at the
[18:16.880 --> 18:25.280]  same time again the radical Islamic threat whose fingerprints are on it
[18:25.280 --> 18:32.800]  9-11 able danger program identified the hijackers long before 9-11 then he had
[18:32.800 --> 18:37.600]  of course Colonel Anthony Schaefer who tried to tell the 9-11 commission about
[18:37.600 --> 18:44.440]  this evidence he was gagged slandered and ignored the man who trained six of the
[18:44.440 --> 18:50.560]  9-11 hijackers Louis Alsaka CIA informant many of the other hijackers
[18:50.560 --> 18:55.920]  trained at US air bases two of the hijackers Khalid Al Midar and Naoui
[18:55.920 --> 19:03.480]  Falzami renting rooms in a house owned and lived in by an FBI informant Newsweek
[19:03.480 --> 19:10.960]  in 2002 reported the hijackers we let escape documented how caught the CIA
[19:10.960 --> 19:15.280]  tracked two suspected terrorists to an al-Qaeda summit in Malaysia in January
[19:15.280 --> 19:20.240]  2000 then looked on as they re-entered America and but began preparations to
[19:20.240 --> 19:28.720]  September 11th and of course you had the spiritual leader the granddaddy of the

[24:30.120 --> 24:36.320]  joining us in around 30 minutes time we're talking about terrorists
[24:36.320 --> 24:42.000]  who trained London bombers was working for US government now while people like
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.280]  Glenn Beck will try and tie together radical Islam and global communism and
[24:47.280 --> 24:51.720]  say that that's the real threat they will uniformly fail to point out the
[24:51.720 --> 24:57.400]  fact that radical Islamic fundamentalism is a complete contrivance of the US
[24:57.400 --> 25:03.240]  military industrial complex not once will Glenn Beck dare to mention that fact
[25:03.240 --> 25:08.520]  we've talked about it in relation to 9-11 before the break and in fact on
[25:08.520 --> 25:18.680]  prisonplanet.com in our top-featured story at the moment we break down a myriad
[25:18.680 --> 25:24.040]  of examples where every single major terror plot in the United States has
[25:24.040 --> 25:30.960]  been contrived by the FBI by the CIA through their network of Arab Muslim
[25:30.960 --> 25:37.160]  double-agent patsies who handle the would-be terrorists radicalize them and
[25:37.160 --> 25:41.840]  which gives them the justification to create giant federal government slush
[25:41.840 --> 25:46.680]  funds from which they get these public-private partnerships which make
[25:46.680 --> 25:52.640]  plenty of dollars for everyone concerned see something say something being one
[25:52.640 --> 25:58.720]  of them naked body scanners being another and on that very subject the
[25:58.720 --> 26:05.960]  underwear bomber of course again al-alaki the CIA lackey was meeting with
[26:05.960 --> 26:11.600]  pentagon top brass months after 9-11 having been the spiritual leader of the
[26:11.600 --> 26:17.680]  alleged hijackers he was involved in directing the underwear bomber it was
[26:17.680 --> 26:22.320]  of course allowed to board the plane by order of the US State Department that was
[26:22.320 --> 26:28.960]  in the Detroit news aided by a well-dressed man he was the CIA agent
[26:28.960 --> 26:33.760]  allowing him to get on the plane and of course the underwear bomber himself he
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.680]  was on a terror watch list he had no passport he had no business being on a
[26:37.680 --> 26:44.640]  plane and in fact eyewitnesses who observed the fizzle as the bomb was
[26:44.640 --> 26:51.480]  about to go off of course it was a aborted it didn't go off noted Abdul
[26:51.480 --> 26:55.520]  Molotov's behavior the underwear bomber has been completely inconsistent with
[26:55.520 --> 26:59.880]  somebody who knew what they were doing he was completely taken unawares by it
[26:59.880 --> 27:07.480]  he was the classic patsy and of course Delta 253 passenger Kurt Haskell has
[27:07.480 --> 27:13.000]  routinely appeared on the Alex Jones show he was on the plane and now he boldly
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.120]  and publicly states that everything he witnessed points to the fact that this
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.720]  was a staged event by the US government to create the pretext for the
[27:22.720 --> 27:28.480]  implementation of naked body scanners which of course came through immediately
[27:28.480 --> 27:36.000]  after the December 2009 staged event and of course made a whole bundle of money
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.520]  for a sir and mr. Chertoff and many others connected with homeland security
[27:40.520 --> 27:47.320]  and these public-private partnerships which continue today so another example
[27:47.320 --> 27:53.200]  where the feds contrived the Islamic threat here's another for you for
[27:53.200 --> 28:00.840]  hud shooting major Nidal Malik Hassan the FBI knew that he was communicating
[28:00.840 --> 28:06.760]  with alleged al-qaeda leaders again one of them was al-alaki the CIA laki for
[28:06.760 --> 28:13.160]  nearly a year before the four hud shootings they didn't seem to be too
[28:13.160 --> 28:16.600]  concerned about telling the army base that he was communicating with the so
[28:16.600 --> 28:22.520]  called al-qaeda terrorist and while he was still on the army base indeed Hassan
[28:22.520 --> 28:29.920]  was being invited to homeland security exercises at the same time so they knew
[28:29.920 --> 28:34.600]  that for hud was coming they knew that he was being handled by these double agent
[28:34.600 --> 28:39.720]  al-qaeda people who were working for the CIA again the attack went ahead the
[28:39.720 --> 28:45.000]  radical Islamic threat was bright was blamed but the true fingerprints of
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.840]  the culprits were never brought to light in the media for dicks the suit the
[28:50.840 --> 28:57.840]  2007 plot to quote kill as many soldiers as possible again the investigation
[28:57.840 --> 29:02.640]  concluded that quote FBI informants were the key figures behind the operation
[29:02.640 --> 29:09.160]  and the six foreign-born Muslims were merely bundling patsies and there's
[29:09.160 --> 29:13.960]  that man again al-alaki the CIA laki he was involved in grooming the patsies
[29:13.960 --> 29:20.800]  he's the main man he's the middleman he's the go-to double agent patsy and we
[29:20.800 --> 29:27.040]  can move to canada toronto the toronto 18 terrorists again the guy who gave them
[29:27.040 --> 29:30.720]  the bomb was working for the royal canadian mounted police we'll go
[29:30.720 --> 29:35.440]  through more examples and we'll play a video on this so-called mythical Islamic
[29:35.440 --> 29:39.360]  threat that's being contrived by the feds after the break stay tuned it's the

[33:06.640 --> 33:09.520]  has basically been financed by british intelligence
[33:09.520 --> 33:14.800]  for more than 90 years and that the revolution that we're seeing sweep all
[33:14.800 --> 33:19.200]  over the middle east and north africa the epicenter of course
[33:19.200 --> 33:23.360]  being cairo in egypt is a globalist operation
[33:23.360 --> 33:27.760]  to destabilize the middle east and with amazement today i watched glenn
[33:27.760 --> 33:30.880]  beck and he was talking about that saying
[33:30.880 --> 33:34.800]  that it's a destabilization campaign but he was saying that it was only george
[33:34.800 --> 33:39.120]  soros and van jones van jones is at the top of the pyramid
[33:39.120 --> 33:42.240]  on his chalkboard he's the leader van jones is some
[33:42.240 --> 33:45.680]  low-level nobody the washington post reported many years ago
[33:45.680 --> 33:48.880]  that tens of millions of dollars have been spent by the federal government
[33:48.880 --> 33:53.280]  to ship school books to muslim schools around the world
[33:53.280 --> 33:57.600]  radicalizing muslims against the west it's our own department of education
[33:57.600 --> 34:01.280]  under both political parties that promotes arabic in schools
[34:01.280 --> 34:05.120]  as part of their tower of babel balkanization
[34:05.120 --> 34:09.440]  multicultural move and that's the problem glenn beck is telling you that the
[34:09.440 --> 34:13.440]  caliphate which is basically just the rebirth of the ottoman empire
[34:13.440 --> 34:19.840]  is this organic socialist muslim movement and that they're somehow teamed up
[34:19.840 --> 34:23.120]  with george soros teamed up with george soros
[34:23.120 --> 34:26.320]  even the london telegraph has the headline
[34:26.320 --> 34:31.600]  egypt protest america's secret backing for rebel leaders behind uprising
[34:31.600 --> 34:36.080]  and glenn beck would say well see that's liberal obama liberal obama
[34:36.080 --> 34:40.400]  financed by the same wall street that funded george w bush and carl roe
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.240]  and his gaggle of crux it's on record that zbigniew
[34:44.240 --> 34:48.720]  brzezinski helped set up the mujahideen now known as al-qaeda
[34:48.720 --> 34:55.680]  in the afghan war it's on record that anwar al-alaki the supposed
[34:55.680 --> 34:59.520]  number one guy under a sum of bin laden and al-qaeda
[34:59.520 --> 35:03.040]  when he was on the most wanted list was meeting secretly
[35:03.040 --> 35:07.760]  at the pentagon two months after 9 11 with the secretary of the army even
[35:07.760 --> 35:11.440]  glenn beck's own fox news reported that it's on record that
[35:11.440 --> 35:18.240]  under bush u.s embassies were ordered to let the supposed hijackers travel from
[35:18.240 --> 35:22.400]  saudi arabia in the united states and said they're not really terrorist they're
[35:22.400 --> 35:25.760]  working for us it's on record that the state department
[35:25.760 --> 35:29.360]  was given orders by an unnamed u.s agency the state department admitted this
[35:29.360 --> 35:33.760]  to help get the underwear bomber on the plane do you think george soros
[35:33.760 --> 35:37.360]  is doing that glenn beck is engaged in a limited hangout
[35:37.360 --> 35:40.400]  he's saying everything's van jones everything's george soros
[35:40.400 --> 35:45.520]  those are just tasteful bad people but what he's not explaining to you is that
[35:45.520 --> 35:49.920]  radical islam has been controlled by the british pre-world war two
[35:49.920 --> 35:53.680]  on record then by hitler and then by western intelligence
[35:53.680 --> 35:58.080]  based in the united states it was radical muslims that were used to
[35:58.080 --> 36:01.200]  overthrow mohammed mozadek and operation ajax
[36:01.200 --> 36:04.640]  in 1953 because he was trying to modernize his nations and trying to keep
[36:04.640 --> 36:09.040]  their oil money for themselves the globalists want radical muslims
[36:09.040 --> 36:15.280]  who are oppressing women and dominating their regions so that they can keep them
[36:15.280 --> 36:19.760]  in squalor and use them as an enemy against the west
[36:19.760 --> 36:23.680]  so the new world order can build up a police state here domestically
[36:23.680 --> 36:28.720]  in the name of countering and glenn beck and his writers who fill his teleprompters
[36:28.720 --> 36:32.000]  know this in this attempt to keep the middle east
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.600]  central asia and north africa in the stone age
[36:35.600 --> 36:39.680]  has been going on for decades and is a grand strategy
[36:39.680 --> 36:44.080]  of destabilization so glenn beck it's that right this is destabilization
[36:44.080 --> 36:48.800]  but he doesn't tell you that there are mega world government promoting
[36:48.800 --> 36:54.400]  corporations he tells you that it's all van jones and george soros sure george
[36:54.400 --> 36:59.600]  soros is one of this gaggle of corrupt globalist
[36:59.600 --> 37:03.840]  but he's only one of them glenn beck tells you now about the new world order
[37:03.840 --> 37:08.080]  and world government but does he tell you that general electric
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.320]  and goldman sacks and jp morgan and all these
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.080]  institutions helped fund the creation of the un
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.880]  no see this is full spectrum dominance the military industrial complex that
[37:20.880 --> 37:24.720]  eisenhower warned us about are masters at controlling
[37:24.720 --> 37:29.520]  all points on the compass and playing three-dimensional chess
[37:29.520 --> 37:34.480]  being able to foresee how things are going to develop
[37:34.480 --> 37:38.720]  and how the dominos are going to fall and so yes they don't
[37:38.720 --> 37:42.400]  want a client dictator that does what they say
[37:42.400 --> 37:46.160]  but brings stability to the middle east they now want a
[37:46.160 --> 37:51.600]  stratagem of tension to create this great clash of civilizations
[37:51.600 --> 37:54.720]  and that's what glenn beck isn't telling you glenn beck
[37:54.720 --> 38:01.280]  is a knowing dupe a willing joseph mccarthy now i admire joseph mccarthy
[38:01.280 --> 38:05.520]  so let me be specific about this he was a well-meaning person who was an
[38:05.520 --> 38:09.760]  unconscious dupe glenn beck clearly is a conscious dupe he's very
[38:09.760 --> 38:12.960]  intelligent we have moles inside his organization
[38:12.960 --> 38:16.080]  we know exactly what's going on we know that they take the information that i
[38:16.080 --> 38:20.160]  cover the ron paul covers the true grassroots movement that we're leading
[38:20.160 --> 38:24.480]  and they synthesize it and turned into a neocon light
[38:24.480 --> 38:28.320]  system so they can control the patriot revolution
[38:28.320 --> 38:33.760]  against tyranny in this country now he may not be evil himself individually
[38:33.760 --> 38:37.600]  but he is someone who has come with the fox news logo
[38:37.600 --> 38:40.800]  to co-opt the liberty movement in this country
[38:40.800 --> 38:44.080]  and he's done a lot better in the last six months or so we challenged him
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.920]  to cover eugenics we've challenged him to cover the global population reduction
[38:47.920 --> 38:51.360]  program and he's come a long way because you're putting pressure on him
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.600]  to do that but in the final equation he's taking on
[38:55.600 --> 38:59.760]  this patriotic camouflage because he needs to have your confidence
[38:59.760 --> 39:02.800]  at the key moment when they put the next neocon
[39:02.800 --> 39:08.080]  savior into place stage terror attacks and try to clamp down this homeland
[39:08.080 --> 39:12.080]  security police state grid that all administrations
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.720]  from jimmy carter right through to barack obama
[39:16.720 --> 39:22.560]  have been continuing to build the bureaucracy is moving forward setting
[39:22.560 --> 39:25.520]  up the control grid that continuity of agenda is
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.840]  absolutely key to understand this but going back to
[39:29.840 --> 39:32.960]  joe mccarthy a well-meaning guy being conned
[39:32.960 --> 39:37.120]  versus willing dupes like obama and glenn beck
[39:37.120 --> 39:40.400]  if you go back and study what happened with mccarthy it's incredible you'll
[39:40.400 --> 39:43.440]  understand what's happening now when he was
[39:43.440 --> 39:49.360]  setting up a police state and interrogating file clerks at the fbi and
[39:49.360 --> 39:52.880]  talking about how communists were hiding under every
[39:52.880 --> 39:57.440]  desk he was loved because the government could set up a police state
[39:57.440 --> 40:00.000]  surveillance grid and get americans to give up their
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  cherished bill of rights and constitution in the name of countering
[40:04.000 --> 40:10.400]  the horrible tyrannical stylistic threat but then mccarthy did deep research
[40:10.400 --> 40:13.840]  and came out and said i've discovered the u.s army
[40:13.840 --> 40:17.920]  and the state department is helping russia and building factories
[40:17.920 --> 40:22.160]  and selling us out to them i've discovered that
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.480]  our government has helped turn over china to the communist
[40:28.480 --> 40:32.320]  and the media laughed and cackled and joe mccarthy went overnight for being
[40:32.320 --> 40:36.320]  this big messianic hero who could do no wrong
[40:36.320 --> 40:39.600]  because he was countering the communist threat by calling for the
[40:39.600 --> 40:42.880]  destruction of her own liberties see by facing that devil
[40:42.880 --> 40:46.160]  we dance with the devil we become the devil they're able to centralize
[40:46.160 --> 40:48.800]  control but as soon as he found out that the
[40:48.800 --> 40:53.600]  white house uh that the pentagon that the state department
[40:53.600 --> 40:57.920]  were actually funding communism and supporting it overnight he was politically
[40:57.920 --> 41:01.440]  destroyed they laughed at him they said sir do you have
[41:01.440 --> 41:05.360]  no decency and he was politically destroyed
[41:05.360 --> 41:08.800]  with all the dirt that they had on him for the alcoholism and the rest of it
[41:08.800 --> 41:12.560]  he was only human but you see glenn beck isn't making that mistake he isn't
[41:12.560 --> 41:15.440]  telling you that the pentagon and the state department
[41:15.440 --> 41:19.040]  are helping get underwear bombers on planes he's not telling you them or all
[41:19.040 --> 41:22.080]  a lucky the number one guy under a summum in laudan who's
[41:22.080 --> 41:25.120]  running the underwear bomber the times square attack the ford hood
[41:25.120 --> 41:28.880]  shooting the shoe bomber is admittedly a globalist
[41:28.880 --> 41:32.960]  agent this isn't our military at the top it isn't our government at the top
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.080]  it's a foreign banking cartel that's stolen tens of trillions from us
[41:38.080 --> 41:41.360]  and they are financing the muslim revolutions
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.920]  they are financing the socialist revolutions the big mega banks have
[41:45.920 --> 41:52.160]  always funded socialism because they get the horde the mass the angry mob
[41:52.160 --> 41:55.280]  to loot the middle class thinking they're going to get part of the money
[41:55.280 --> 42:00.320]  they get chicken feed paltry table scraps and the rest of it is transferred
[42:00.320 --> 42:04.720]  to corporate welfare to the defense system to trillion dollar
[42:04.720 --> 42:09.440]  banker bailouts and glenn beck will not do what macarthie did
[42:09.440 --> 42:12.960]  he'll tell you there's communists all day and there are
[42:12.960 --> 42:16.400]  but he won't tell you that they're funded by the big mega banks
[42:16.400 --> 42:20.320]  oh he'll pick out george soros who's definitely a dangerous globalist but
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.600]  he'll leave it at that he's splitting it again into a left right
[42:23.600 --> 42:26.960]  paradigm that oh there's this liberal soros he runs it all
[42:26.960 --> 42:31.840]  when soros is only one small piece of this larger system
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.000]  yes it's true that george soros connected groups have been supporting
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.240]  the muslim brotherhood and other organizations that are trying to take
[42:40.240 --> 42:44.800]  over egypt but it's also true that our pentagon
[42:44.800 --> 42:48.480]  and the state department and our government has been financing them
[42:48.480 --> 42:53.040]  for decades and that's what glenn beck isn't telling you
[42:53.040 --> 42:56.240]  that's what he won't talk about because if he did that
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.400]  he'd be destroyed just like joseph mccarthy but the difference is
[43:00.400 --> 43:06.560]  joe didn't know what he was doing glenn is willingly engaging in this duplicity
[43:06.560 --> 43:12.240]  anyway you slice it van jones is not at the top of the pyramid
[43:12.240 --> 43:16.000]  yes george soros is very near the top but he's only one
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.240]  operative in this system and the whole world is a stage and each of his players
[43:20.240 --> 43:26.880]  upon it let's not let glenn beck co-opt the answer to 1984 1776
[43:26.880 --> 43:31.040]  movement you are that movement ideas are invincible when
[43:31.040 --> 43:36.160]  they have truths on their side ideas are bulletproof and glenn's come a long
[43:36.160 --> 43:40.720]  way that's why i'm not making my film about glenn beck that's why
[43:40.720 --> 43:45.200]  i'm not attacking him uh even though every time i watch i see the
[43:45.200 --> 43:49.600]  deception because we're trying to get him to
[43:49.600 --> 43:54.640]  move truly towards the spirit of 1776 and if we demand liberty and
[43:54.640 --> 43:58.800]  freedom the system will respond and that's beginning to
[43:58.800 --> 44:02.080]  happen we told you day one this was a destabilization
[44:02.080 --> 44:05.680]  program to plunge the middle east into flames and now
[44:05.680 --> 44:09.840]  three weeks later it's all being confirmed this is a lot
[44:09.840 --> 44:13.600]  bigger than george soros and that's the point i'm trying to get
[44:13.600 --> 44:17.840]  across to you this is very sophisticated very complex and if we're
[44:17.840 --> 44:21.920]  going to have true liberty folks who do their research and find out the truth
[44:21.920 --> 44:25.360]  for themselves it's a lot more complex than a
[44:25.360 --> 44:29.360]  chalkboard with some socialist unions and and
[44:29.360 --> 44:33.040]  van jones and yes glenn beck overall tells the truth
[44:33.040 --> 44:37.200]  that these powerful communist elites want revolution
[44:37.200 --> 44:40.560]  to destabilize things so that they can come to power
[44:40.560 --> 44:44.400]  but what he doesn't tell you is that the mega banks have always promoted
[44:44.400 --> 44:48.560]  communism for the common man as a way of outlying
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.040]  their competition and through government taking our tax money and
[44:53.040 --> 44:56.320]  putting it into offshore havens that are immune
[44:56.320 --> 44:59.360]  from the socialistic communism that they visit
[44:59.360 --> 45:06.560]  upon us glenn tell the full truth don't tell us that the new world order just
[45:06.560 --> 45:12.320]  started and george soros created it george soros's people told mine in a
[45:12.320 --> 45:16.320]  very threatening way the ship has already sailed
[45:16.320 --> 45:20.720]  there will be a new world order get on the team
[45:20.720 --> 45:24.720]  or get out and i've seen you move in the right direction
[45:24.720 --> 45:29.440]  come all the way and i give you my word that i will
[45:29.440 --> 45:33.440]  support you at that point i want to see you do the right thing
[45:33.440 --> 45:38.800]  i don't want to see you sit there and play into this muslim phobia
[45:38.800 --> 45:42.560]  when on record republicans and democrats are part of the social
[45:42.560 --> 45:45.280]  engineering system and are doing everything they can
[45:45.280 --> 45:48.960]  to protect radical muslims the evidence is right there
[45:48.960 --> 45:52.000]  our own government is supporting the muslim
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.360]  brotherhood who's calling to break the peace treaty with israel
[45:55.360 --> 46:00.080]  to destabilize the region i am honored and thankful at many levels
[46:00.080 --> 46:04.240]  that you're taking our information but i'm also frustrated that you still
[46:04.240 --> 46:07.840]  twisted people out there need to understand that alex jones isn't your
[46:07.840 --> 46:12.320]  leader glenn beck isn't your leader common sense the bill of rights and
[46:12.320 --> 46:16.240]  constitution is the sheet of music we need to be singing from
[46:16.240 --> 46:20.480]  and glenn beck talks about how he loves the spirit of 1776
[46:20.480 --> 46:23.920]  but on so many fundamentals he doesn't support
[46:23.920 --> 46:28.160]  that bill of rights and constitution and he says don't support it when we're
[46:28.160 --> 46:32.560]  fighting the muslims but the radicalized muslims are on record
[46:32.560 --> 46:37.200]  funded by his bosses you want to find the new world order
[46:37.200 --> 46:41.520]  look at rupert murdoch glenn rupert murdoch is a big devos attendee
[46:41.520 --> 46:45.280]  promotes globalism promotes carbon taxes promotes everything george soros
[46:45.280 --> 46:48.000]  does but because he's cloaked in the fox news
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.440]  manel he's not criticized awake americans that we've awakened
[46:53.440 --> 46:58.000]  are just some market for you to exploit and that's wrong
[46:58.000 --> 47:02.000]  this is life and death we're dealing with and until i see glenn beck
[47:02.000 --> 47:05.920]  talk about amour aulaki uh working for the pentagon and running all the
[47:05.920 --> 47:09.680]  terrorist and until i hear glenn uh talk about
[47:09.680 --> 47:12.960]  the see something say something campaign and how it's all meant to have us
[47:12.960 --> 47:17.200]  title on each other uh we know that you're working for the dark side
[47:17.200 --> 47:21.040]  all right glenn you can't have it both ways decide which side you're on
[47:21.040 --> 47:24.960]  and now is the time to get involved and expose the globalist but not just their
[47:24.960 --> 47:32.000]  communist henchmen but the actual controllers it is extremely exciting
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.280]  that glenn beck is having to talk about the new world order and world
[47:35.280 --> 47:37.760]  government even if he's blaming it on mid-level
[47:37.760 --> 47:40.960]  patsies it shows how far our movement to get the
[47:40.960 --> 47:44.000]  truth out is the fact that this information has become so
[47:44.000 --> 47:49.520]  mainline shows that a renaissance of liberty a rediscovering of the spirit
[47:49.520 --> 47:54.160]  of 1776 is upon us and each and every one of us
[47:54.160 --> 47:58.400]  don't have front row seats to history we're active participants
[47:58.400 --> 48:02.480]  on the field and to all of you that have gotten the word out over the years
[48:02.480 --> 48:06.080]  to all of you that have stood up and told the truth and then laughed it by your
[48:06.080 --> 48:11.360]  neighbors they're not laughing now the people ready to hear the truth
[48:11.360 --> 48:16.560]  get out there together we can accelerate this awakening process
[48:16.560 --> 48:22.000]  and we can ensure that there is a force of awakened people that understand the
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.120]  true paradigm and we can defeat this new world order
[48:27.120 --> 48:30.080]  so you've just heard alex jones that break down
[48:30.080 --> 48:35.520]  the deception being conducted by glenn beck and others in the media
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.880]  invoking the threat of radical islam which is a real threat but
[48:40.880 --> 48:44.960]  completely omitting the fact that radical muslims are being
[48:44.960 --> 48:48.560]  controlled by the u.s military industrial complex
[48:48.560 --> 48:51.840]  and we were going through a list of how that's evident
[48:51.840 --> 48:56.800]  in every single terror plot that's been blamed on radical islam
[48:56.800 --> 49:00.960]  that's occurred in the united states certainly since 9 11
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.680]  and also even before 9 11 i mean take for example the recent
[49:05.680 --> 49:10.800]  portland plot mohammed osman moham adoud who was
[49:10.800 --> 49:16.320]  accused of you know trying to blow up this christmas tree ceremony there in

[49:25.440 --> 49:31.280]  van the vehicle and other implements that are used to help him carry out the
[49:31.280 --> 49:37.440]  aborted attack they gave him the bomb the fbi agents gave him the bomb
[49:37.440 --> 49:42.640]  it's just a byline you know two weeks after it all blows over nobody cares

[49:46.880 --> 49:52.000]  trained london bombers was working for u.s government the guy who set up the

[54:21.600 --> 54:27.520]  paul joseph watson sitting in for alex today we're talking about the radical
[54:27.520 --> 54:31.920]  islamic threat and how people like glenn beck will
[54:31.920 --> 54:38.240]  invoke this constantly while failing to point out the true culprits behind it
[54:38.240 --> 54:44.080]  and we're joined in studio to co-host for the remainder of this broadcast will
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.800]  be playing an interview in the final hour which will be a rebroadcast
[54:48.800 --> 54:52.880]  but erin dykes who wrote the big article on saturday
[54:52.880 --> 54:57.280]  regarding the egyptian revolution and how people like glenn beck and others in
[54:57.280 --> 55:02.000]  the media are completely obfuscating the fact that this is a
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.400]  contrivance of the brazinski crowd and the grand
[55:06.400 --> 55:12.000]  chess board that goes along with it erin dykes good to co-host with you
[55:12.000 --> 55:17.120]  today hi paul how you doing great now i was on the
[55:17.120 --> 55:21.520]  treadmill on friday night and i was listening to the glenn beck program
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.880]  the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment as they call it and he
[55:26.880 --> 55:31.440]  was talking about how this egyptian revolution and the
[55:31.440 --> 55:35.920]  fact that they got rid of mubarak was a deadly threat to america
[55:35.920 --> 55:39.440]  because now the muslim brotherhood would take a
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.920]  stranglehold of power and you've got the election coming up in six months now in
[55:43.920 --> 55:47.760]  egypt of course he completely completely failed to point out the
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.880]  fact um that the warhabi egyptian muslim brotherhood
[55:52.880 --> 55:56.320]  was founded and financed from its very inception
[55:56.320 --> 56:02.800]  by the cia and then on saturday you wrote the article with alex
[56:02.800 --> 56:06.800]  which talks about the history of some of this and the the grand chess board
[56:06.800 --> 56:10.480]  behind what's happening in egypt so we're go ahead and
[56:10.480 --> 56:14.640]  talk to us about that article yeah bottom line how long has british
[56:14.640 --> 56:18.160]  intelligence been uh messing around in the region
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.800]  for their own colonial interests they totally have contrived the whole arab
[56:22.800 --> 56:26.240]  thing and it's just like they could thrive communist threat
[56:26.240 --> 56:30.160]  during the soviet era when we find out that we built them up all along and
[56:30.160 --> 56:32.800]  they're supposed to be our great enemy throughout the world
[56:32.800 --> 56:36.720]  it's just ridiculous that people like glenn beck won't focus on the military
[56:36.720 --> 56:41.840]  interests behind this all and i i'm flabbergasted by it
[56:41.840 --> 56:45.280]  you know specifically in the article we've seen all these color revolutions
[56:45.280 --> 56:50.480]  over the past couple years uh kazakhstan and uh kyrgyzstan
[56:50.480 --> 56:54.160]  other places in central asia all fit into this brzezinski
[56:54.160 --> 56:58.400]  uh scheme to insert in circle russia and guarantee
[56:58.400 --> 57:05.200]  basically the anglo allied interest which is important because of course
[57:05.200 --> 57:10.640]  the man now being touted as one of the primary contenders to be the new
[57:10.640 --> 57:15.040]  egyptian president is mohammed al-baradi who is uh
[57:15.040 --> 57:18.240]  sits on the board of this international crisis group
[57:18.240 --> 57:21.840]  uh which by no coincidence is uh controlled by
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.320]  z big so been the big new brzezinski um who was the
[57:26.320 --> 57:30.240]  author of this grand chess board and who was fundamental in
[57:30.240 --> 57:34.800]  um financing the arab mujahideen along with the psalm bin ladin
[57:34.800 --> 57:39.280]  to fight the soviets in 1979 and of course it was
[57:39.280 --> 57:45.760]  brzezinski who in a cfr speech um last year i believe in june in canada
[57:45.760 --> 57:49.360]  said that very imminently there would be this mass
[57:49.360 --> 57:52.880]  global awakening that people were becoming more
[57:52.880 --> 57:56.640]  angry about their grievances especially young people
[57:56.640 --> 58:00.400]  in the middle eastern in africa and that we would soon see
[58:00.400 --> 58:05.440]  uh a grand political awakening um primarily led by young people which is
[58:05.440 --> 58:09.840]  exactly what we've now seen uh in tunisia uh in egypt
[58:09.840 --> 58:13.040]  of course and now in algeria and other countries
[58:13.040 --> 58:17.200]  um so the globalists were prepared for it and they uh they'd
[58:17.200 --> 58:21.920]  groomed their selected candidates to swoop in and hijack these revolutions
[58:21.920 --> 58:27.040]  in the aftermath so we'll continue to delve into those subjects and more here
[58:27.040 --> 58:31.120]  on the alex jones show on this monday february 14th edition

[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:23.120]  network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.840]  second hour of the alex jones show today paul joseph watson filling in for alex
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:33.760]  we've also got erin dykes info wars writer and researcher in studio
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.000]  and erin is co-hosting the rest of the broadcast with me today
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.520]  we're talking about glenn beck not just glenn beck but basically the entirety
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.680]  of the so-called right-wing neocon media
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.920]  um who have become very upset about the possibility of the muslim
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.600]  brotherhood taking the reins of power in egypt
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.360]  and certainly other countries in the region following this apparent
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.120]  wave of revolutions that shows no sign of abating
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.000]  and basically beck is trying to uh invoke the islamic threat
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.680]  but not in an honest way he's trying to tie it into this so-called
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.520]  uh global communist conspiracy for one world government that he's always
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.800]  talking about it without mentioning the truth
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.560]  which is the fact that both communism and radical islam
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.920]  are merely tools of the new world order being used
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.600]  to advance the to advance the overall agenda for
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:35.120]  global government um now erin dykes uh wrote an article on saturday called
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:42.000]  dear glenn beck egypt destabilization opt hatched by globalists not communists
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.240]  and in this article he explains how this wave of revolutions
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.640]  um is about a globalist agenda to destabilize the region
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.400]  uh so they can then swoop in with their carefully
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.640]  groomed establishment candidates to take over the reins of power
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.600]  um at the moment in egypt the situation is mubarak resigned on friday
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.120]  there were reports out of israel uh that he suffered a
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.080]  some kind of stroke and he's now in fact in a coma
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.280]  and now in egypt the military have taken command
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.720]  uh they've temporarily suspended the constitution
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.000]  and are now saying that strikes are illegal they're saying
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.600]  you can still protest but they're telling the protesters
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.240]  to go home while pointing guns at them so mixed message somewhat
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.080]  so basically it's a it's a military dictatorship temporarily
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.360]  at least uh and the key issue is who will take
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:42.160]  uh control of the country um in this election in six months time
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.480]  um and which candidate you know what interest they'll represent because the
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.240]  globalists under brazinski um certainly have
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:55.840]  um their finger in the melting pot um erin any other points you wanted to
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.080]  mention about your article uh well yeah paul because
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.480]  the haraats was also reporting it was a quiet military coup
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.440]  behind mubarak's resignation which we know was a us military backed
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.760]  silent coup and that's just part of the whole game that people like glenbeck
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.200]  will tell you it's radical islam with the left hand
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.720]  but they won't explain what's going on with the right hand uh certainly we
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.360]  can hope that this region isn't going to become
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.680]  more radical than it already is uh but to the extent that it is i think the
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.680]  us and the other allied intelligence agencies
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.680]  really have a hand in doing that and so it's pretty disingenuous
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.160]  uh the other aspect is um the popular uprising
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.560]  all the people in the streets uh you saw similar things last year with the ran
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.880]  uh george soros was indicated in that kind of popular uprising
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.040]  and i really wonder if that's just a rebranding effort uh the same as we saw
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.000]  with the change of guard from bush to obama
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.680]  uh when there was very little substantive change between the two
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.080]  uh what do you think paul well exactly and i mean
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.120]  what's amazing about that you mentioned about the no
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.200]  substantive change between obama and bush is the fact that
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.480]  today we've got this um young americans for freedom group coming out and i
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.720]  believe uh curt nimo has posted an article on this on infos.com in the
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.960]  past couple of hours expelling congressman ron paul
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.680]  from their movement because of his quote delusional and disturbing alliance
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.720]  with the fringe anti-war movement and they in fact point out that
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.280]  the obama administration is quote a feeble and appeasing administration
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.360]  and we'll point out their hypocrisy uh in the next segment on the alex
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:05:00.320]  joneshow at prison at planet dot tv don't go away
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.520]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.520]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.280]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.880]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.120]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:27.200]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:31.040]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.400]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.160]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.920]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.360]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.520]  sponsors you can get more information at
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:52.080]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.160]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:02.560]  or call 1-877-327-0365 alex told you the government announced recently
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.520]  that the recession is over it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:11.440]  unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.800]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.040]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.800]  news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.160]  in addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.360]  you should consider a food savings account from e-foods direct
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.760]  they both make fabulous investments food is our greatest dependency and we know
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.880]  it will be more precious than any financial resource
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.600]  you and your family need food to survive a crisis
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.000]  and you can't eat paper stocks or metals alex has been urging you to invest

[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.920]  before the break i was just getting into this story about how
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.440]  the young americans for freedom organization
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:37.280]  yaf announced saturday that they were going to expel
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.200]  ron paul from their organization because of his quote
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:46.400]  delusional and disturbing alliance with the fringe anti-war movement
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.560]  and basically they they uh labeled the obama administration as quote feeble
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.000]  and appeasing and attempted to uh lump
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.240]  ron paul in with the obama administration um
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.480]  and uh make out that he was some kind of weak-minded liberal
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:09.200]  in that he didn't want to support carpet bombing brown people in the third
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.640]  world now the the first the first thing to address
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.640]  on this is the fact that they label obama and his
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.400]  administration feeble and appeasing when in fact the
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:27.200]  obama administration war chest year after year
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.800]  has been bigger than anything that was ever passed
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:37.280]  under george w bush in fact obama's 2011 war chest
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.360]  um swelled to more than 700 billion dollars
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.240]  which is is more than bush ever got you know there are more troops in afghanistan
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.760]  now under obama than there ever were under bush
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.760]  and obama's tacit withdrawal of some troops out of iraq
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.200]  haven't you know they've only been replaced by more mercenaries
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.600]  um the first thing that obama did upon his election was
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.520]  to send 30 000 more troops into afghanistan
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.440]  expand the bush-ear of bombings in pakistan uh as well as opening up a new
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.960]  front in yemen so if you think that
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.040]  bombing brown people in the third world for the security interests of the
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.560]  united states is conservative then you should
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.480]  support the obama administration and yet the young
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.160]  americans for freedom are saying that ron paul
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.320]  isn't a real conservative because he doesn't support that
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:41.120]  now the fact that obama has a bigger military budget than bush
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:45.760]  year upon year um gives a pretty clear indication
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.280]  that occupying and invading foreign countries has nothing
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:56.320]  to do with true conservatism um of course the foundational belief system
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.480]  of the neocons and this was uh this came to light during the iraq
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:07.280]  invasion in 2003 um is leon trotsky remember the article out of the
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:12.000]  national uh post trotsky's ghost wandering the white house
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.200]  and trotsky of course was the head of the fourth international
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.440]  uh the communist organization so i mean he was
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.720]  he was the author of the doctrine of preemptive war
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.520]  and this is the guy who the top neocons who in the bush era
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.560]  helped launch the iraq war they were the authors of the peanut document
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.720]  you know trotsky was their philosophical guru
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:43.680]  as well as leo strauss this other uh neoconservative icon uh a man who
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:51.760]  advocated that the state engage in per perpetual deception of its citizens
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.240]  in order to create absolute power and basically pure fascism
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.720]  so this is the uh philosophical foundation of the neocon belief
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.560]  of preemptive warfare that obama is now aggressively
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.560]  continuing having picked up the baton from bush
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:12.080]  and because ron paul opposes that because he's a real
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.720]  founding father conservative the founding fathers of course advocated
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.600]  a non-interventionist foreign policy because ron paul sides with the founding
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:27.120]  fathers this uh pathetic little neocon organization has kicked him out of their
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.120]  group but i mean erin shouldn't ron paul be
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.560]  absolutely honored and proud to be rid of this group
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:40.080]  given uh who they align themselves with they should paul and this whole feeble
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.960]  thing is a code word for that they're very scared
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:48.560]  that ron paul you know single-handedly won the cpaq poll over the weekend
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.640]  you know defeating mit romney defeating sarah paleon defeating newt gingrich and
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.680]  all the other can candidates they have lined up
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.160]  uh you saw donald trump saying ron paul has no chance of winning
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.680]  uh that's because they were scared that conservatives at cpaq
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.000]  were completely for the ron paul camp they booed dick cheney they booed
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.240]  donald rumsfeld and they're really concerned that ron paul is hitting the
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.720]  notes really at the right time in place you've even seen sarah
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.880]  paleon now we know the tea party thing is controlled and contrived and taken over
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.400]  but it's still hopeful that you see sarah paleon saying
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.560]  cutting defense and military spending is no longer a sacred cow
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.000]  uh that this dead bubble uh is hitting at the right time
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.040]  uh just as we see this stuff happening in egypt
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.600]  it's very uh hopeful that we're seeing ron paul and other people talking about
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.120]  cutting the military budget uh of course you saw ron paul
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.520]  mentioned that in part of his speech uh i think that part of the establishment
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:51.840]  associated with the neocons it feels very threatened that they can even
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.800]  talk about in these debates cutting the military budget
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.440]  because it's done nothing but build up regardless of left or right presidents
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.440]  for the past 60 years or so and of course with obama you see a
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.280]  continuity of government uh not only because we know who's really calling
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.680]  the shots behind the scenes uh but because they all want war
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.640]  you see his deput deputee secretary of state under hillary
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:22.000]  uh steinberg he wrote a paper called preventive war a useful tool so
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  they're all just of this neocon mindset and to see someone like ron paul coming
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.040]  in with a strong backing stronger than he was in 2008 this whole wave has grown
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.480]  they're very concerned about a return to true conservatism
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.480]  or just into this anti-war paradigm
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.440]  well i mean if if they were so you know if they really thought that ron paul
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.920]  could never win the election as um donald trump said last week
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.320]  why would they so obsessively trash him every opportunity they get
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.040]  they're obviously scared about the fact that somebody like ron paul has got
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.880]  the grassroots movement behind him um to get the motivation to get the
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.200]  snowball effect that could really lead him to challenge obama
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:12.560]  and remember we had the um rasmus and paul last year i believe it was april
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.160]  2010 which showed that if there was an election
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:20.480]  there and then between ron paul and barack obama
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.720]  that obama would only win by one percent and that's with
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.600]  a significant portion of the u.s voting public a lot of them still don't even
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.720]  know ron paul is because he hasn't had the chance to get a
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.880]  significant platform as part of a national debate but even
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.320]  without that he was shown as only being one percentage point behind obama
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.440]  uh if they had gone head to head granted that's
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:49.760]  that's come down a little in in the past couple of months but only because
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:56.080]  obama enjoyed this 15 point bounce in the aftermath of the two son shootings
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:01.920]  um but still uh as i talked about on friday a rasmus and paul last week
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.240]  showed that ron paul had a better chance of defeating obama
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:11.120]  than sarah palin now palin's obviously going to be the darling of the
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.280]  establishment republicans and the co-opted tea party
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.680]  and yet ron paul's got a better chance of going head to head with obama
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.080]  so it just shows that this um idea that he's got no chance of
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:29.920]  winning the president presidency um is a a tactic on behalf of the neocons to
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.000]  create a self-fulfilling prophecy because all the polls show that he's got a
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.960]  very real chance of beating obama if it was a level playing field which of
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:42.480]  course the establishment media is determined not to
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.040]  be the case which is why uh during the 2008 campaign
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.720]  they consistently trashed ron paul's name similar to how they uh
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:57.120]  threw all manner of mud at rand paul during his recent
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.640]  senatorial campaign um which of course was completely skewed distorted it was
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.880]  a massive smear on every level everything they threw at him from the
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.520]  aqua buddha to the civil rights force and yet rand paul
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.720]  still easily defeated his opponents become senator
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.520]  and now indeed you know rand paul's talking about maybe running for president
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.000]  so i mean the game has changed in the past four years and
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.080]  i don't think they'll be able to discredit ron paul to the extent that
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.720]  they were four or five years ago which means that
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:35.040]  he's got a very real chance if he gets that momentum going
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.840]  i think he does and i think it's just that you see this contrived media voice
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.960]  always talking about sarah paleon always saying that
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.680]  you know certain establishment candidates are the only one anyone's
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.280]  going to pay attention to but it shows the power of the internet that the
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.000]  ron paul movement the supporters for rand paul
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.920]  have been out there and look what they're doing uh once they're in office
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.960]  we may not be able to trust the republicans themselves but
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:03.600]  rand paul came out strongly for not extending the patriot act
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.880]  uh even though the house ended up voting for it in that second vote
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.960]  we've seen ron paul talking about really just sacred cow issues cutting the
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:14.640]  military budget bringing home the troops as he has for years
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.160]  uh now it's finally gaining traction and i think the system is freaked out by
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.320]  that but it really is a contrived media thing to have
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.680]  all these people saying ron paul can't win not only is it a self-fulfilling
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:30.080]  prophecy but it's use of those media buzz terms i remember uh
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.160]  you know leading up to 2008 we did a poll for ron paul we commissioned one
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.160]  through zogby and uh at the time mit romney kept polling
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.160]  28 percent 30 percent uh we got that script
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.080]  the script for uh mit romney had been contrived it had all these buzzwords
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.600]  calling him a hero saying how you'd save the olympics how you
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.720]  done all these wonderful things when we had them rewrite it and use
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.240]  neutral terms he didn't poll nearly as high and uh
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.040]  so that's just an example of how you could see the media contrivance and
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:03.040]  who they predict supposedly as winners in these races
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.400]  so hopefully ron paul is gaining enough traction that he'll get a fair shot this
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.800]  time and i hope he runs well exactly he hasn't
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.960]  announced yet he's expected to announce i mean all the candidates at this
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:19.680]  c-pack conference are expected to announce their candidacy for president
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.680]  so we all expect ron paul to do the same
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.560]  what's important about it is that him and rand have straight stayed true to
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.360]  their principles as real conservatives and not marxists like
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.200]  leon trotsky as all these other neocons worship
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.520]  and that's the reason why why his popularity remains and why the grassroots
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.520]  movement behind him remains so strong we'll be back
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.760]  on the alex jones show after the break i watch the live stream at prison at

[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.440]  france will help the transition to a global financial system based on
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.280]  several international currencies the french economy minister said
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.680]  today and this is france and china basically calling for the end of the
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.440]  us dollar as the world reserve currency just days after the imf again
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.680]  called for sdrs to replace the dollar as the world reserve currency
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.160]  and indeed their own reserve accumulation and i am international
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.120]  monetary stability document in which they claim that a global
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.560]  currency called the bank or would be controlled by a
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.480]  global central bank and used to replace the us dollar
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.680]  so that agenda is now being kicked into high gear
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.760]  also an article that's just gone up on prisonplanet.com
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:20.080]  obama pencils in 37 billion dollar budget increase for dhs naked
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.800]  body scanners the obama administration is to propose a 37
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.880]  billion dollar increase in federal spending for the department of homeland
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.800]  security earmarking funds for more radiation firing naked body scanners
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.880]  in airports around the country and don't forget it's not just in airports
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.800]  anymore the truck checkpoints for commercial
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.640]  vehicles at rest stops that have been occurring over the past year or so
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.440]  now being expanded to highways and roads across the nation
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:55.680]  so this is a thumbs up from obama to big sis
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.560]  to continue the excellent job she's been doing in butchering the us
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.360]  constitution now of course napolitano herself gave
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.160]  a speech only last week in which she cited the
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.200]  portland attempted christmas tree bombing
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.480]  as a major reason why the dhs needs more money
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:22.240]  to fight the radical islamist threat um fail fail to uh add the fact that
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.560]  the fbi gave the guy the bomb the van the cell phone
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.480]  radicalized him and without the federal provocateurs that were involved in the
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.520]  plot wouldn't have been able to go forward with it
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:38.160]  so again big sis is seizing upon staged contrived
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:43.040]  terror plots that the fbi runs uh in order to get this 37
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:46.800]  billion dollar increase in funding from obama
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.920]  erin dykes your thoughts on that yeah i'm absolutely disgusted by this but we
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.160]  already knew they were going to stand down
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.280]  after the public said no to the body scanners
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.960]  uh back at thanksgiving time uh hopefully bob bar and them are still
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.320]  going to push that lawsuit forward but we saw
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.160]  dhs stand down and and supposedly listen to the people
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.840]  saying they didn't want body scanners while they roll it into the super bowl
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.040]  and while they announce it's going to go in shopping malls and
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.480]  and as you pointed out on the highways and stuff and now of course there's a
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.880]  bigger budget for naked body scanners why do we need these and and yes why
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.160]  aren't they talking about all the cases where it's an fbi
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.480]  contrivance a sting operation where they usually give them the bomb
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:33.520]  i i don't know what to say why is that never the story
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.200]  why is it always more more more of course it's because it's a continued agenda
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:41.520]  but uh what do you say paul well of course the naked body
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.720]  scanners they were implemented after the christmas day
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.400]  bombing with a staged underwear bomber who was allowed to get on the plane with
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:51.840]  the aid of the state department and the well-dressed man as we talked about
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.440]  earlier in the show and of course even in that case the naked
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.360]  bonus body scanners now being used in airports across the world would not
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.520]  have prevented that attempted bombing from taking place
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:08.080]  it's not only the privacy aspect uh the fact that the feds are going to see you
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.760]  and your children naked it's the fact that these scanners fire off
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.400]  radiation um which the largest radiation safety
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.120]  group on the planet has said could lead to serious health problems
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.360]  and indeed uh napolitano big sis as well as john
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:32.320]  pistolia the tsa had routinely lie uh pistolia again just a few days ago in
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.840]  in front of congress uh and saying that the johns hopkins
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.760]  university has completely validated these body
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:44.160]  scanners as being safe when in fact the johns hopkins university
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.560]  directly stated that they were a health threat and we've written many articles on
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.600]  the fact that every time it comes up every time
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:56.080]  napolitano or pistolia have to testify about this they just tell lie
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.320]  after lie after lie and it's no surprise that they
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.000]  instantly seize upon these terror plots that the federal government
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.760]  has contrived uh in order to guarantee this massive
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.360]  federal slosh fund which of course also goes to the
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.960]  private companies that are in on the scam with them
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.160]  yeah and of course the whole system's turned on its head the way to
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.400]  the way to protect us from radical tyrants is to uphold the
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.280]  fourth amendment the rest of the bill of rights not to destroy it
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.840]  enforce everyone to be checked um but you know those body scanners were
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:32.400]  coming into airports before that could thrive to
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.160]  christ was day bombing that was a contrived hoax and they already had the
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.280]  plan they were already rolling them out and they had already bought them
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.680]  that's right i'll leave you in the capable hands of erin
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.880]  dykes that's me for today stay tuned for the rest of

[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:12.880]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:16.080]  americans at home i've turned a memories influence
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.000]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots

[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:07.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.680]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.200]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:24.800]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:28.720]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:32.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.360]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:38.400]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:44.400]  federal reserve is working against our american system
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:47.600]  i added the headline it's the bank versus the republic
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:51.280]  uh really good take on andrew jackson versus the fed
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.960]  and the early founding father's attempt against the ross child interest
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:00.400]  and the other factions there uh we have cia director leon panetta warns of a
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.880]  possible cyber pearl harbor interesting choice pearl harbor because we
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:08.240]  know it'll be a contrived internet attack they've already talked about
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:12.080]  taking over the internet they have an internet kill switch in the works
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:18.320]  and bills uh to go along with it um mcclatchy obama assertion fbi can get
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.560]  phone records without oversight why not they're going to just continue
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.480]  this illegal terrorist operation against the american public
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.280]  always pretending the threat is greater and greater
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.440]  uh but we know who's really behind it and of course if they're going to
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.600]  extend the patriot act uh why not get phone fbi phone records without oversight
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.600]  algeria shuts down the internet and facebook is protest mount
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.440]  uh we've already got into this but uh we see the whole middle east
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.040]  in a supposed uprising we're going to keep a close eye on what's really going
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.880]  on there as egypt has just been taken over basically by the
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.440]  military uh the la times los angeles is getting
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.640]  tough with political protesters they want jail time
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:05.840]  uh for people blocking the streets and stuff like that
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.040]  uh let's hope they don't throw away the first amendment with it
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:15.200]  uh swine flu the vaccine for swine flu has been linked to a 900 increase in
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.320]  the risk of developing narcolepsy even though they've told us
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:22.080]  everyone must take these shots uh they've told us they're safe
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:26.080]  uh you better think twice about that arizona is suing the u.s government
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.920]  for failing to enforce immigration laws uh jan brewer
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:33.600]  certainly not perfect but she's been absolutely ridiculed over that
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.280]  um that the federal government should protect our borders
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:43.040]  is just a basic part of the constitution was joe was judge john roll the actual
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:47.600]  target of the giford shooting uh that's an article by ethan a huff
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.920]  um really raising questions about if the
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:57.200]  tusan shooting was contrived in any way and if the very constitutional judge
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.520]  john roll was targeted uh we've had sheriff mac brown um
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:05.120]  excuse me sheriff richard mackon about that and i think it's an important
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:10.400]  question to raise 21 signs that the once great u.s economy is being gutted
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.560]  engineered economic collapse approaching we better hope not
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:19.600]  and david eich talks about how there has been no revolution thus far in egypt
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:22.400]  uh for the same reasons we've talked about that it's been a
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.240]  military back who a silent coup ousting mubarak
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:31.840]  uh and we will see who takes control from there i wanted to get more into
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.560]  dear glenn beck egypt destabilization are patched by the globalist
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:39.920]  not the communist and the reason for that title
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.440]  is because the new world order globalists who are in power now
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:48.400]  uh have been in power for at least about a hundred years in its present form
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.320]  uh probably longer and everything we've seen going on
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:55.920]  with geopolitics including and the middle east region
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.720]  has been controlled by british intelligence and the british empire
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.880]  um designs uh which means that they're always using
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.000]  the hegelian dialectic to play both sides they
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.160]  they fund an enemy then they fight against them uh when they replace a
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.880]  dictator they always have someone new to go in
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:18.880]  and they most importantly never want too strong of a leader
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:23.360]  to stay in power for too long uh you saw this in egypt
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:27.040]  uh the whole time not only has british intelligence been behind the radical
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:31.120]  elements in that region they have put in place and taken out the
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:35.120]  dictators uh the muslim brotherhood and the cia
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.160]  ran out nasser uh in the 70s well in the late 60s and then the 70s
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.280]  they challenged his power then he had to kind of fight for it
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.920]  uh then we saw nasser have really a well timed and suspicious death
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:52.800]  and he's not the only leader but this is all part of the larger
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:58.400]  british intelligence now american great game for geopolitical control
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.560]  and in the post-world war two era you really saw
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.760]  uh u.s military forces taking over what had been the british empire
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:12.880]  uh the realignment uh given the victories of the allies in world war two
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.200]  uh you saw the british convince the us that they need to kind of take over
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.800]  these bases put bases into place and make sure they
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:28.400]  maintain stability over the global uh system by keeping chaos in the region
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:34.480]  chaos is the way to control the region as the slogan goes order out of chaos
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:40.560]  and this great game really well if you pull up spigman's rimlin which is in
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:45.200]  my article spigman's rimlin it shows a region of tension all
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:50.640]  the way from europe through the middle east through india central asia
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:55.120]  and all the way to the eastern side of aja circling russia
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.720]  and the you can see even as the lines pit together this is a hagellian dialectic
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.560]  it's meant to be order out of chaos clashing countries
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:07.840]  and it's just really interesting to go back through history
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:13.200]  we have the cecil round uh cecil roads roundtable group the secret societies
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:17.680]  cecil roads was in south africa and he and his people
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:20.800]  completely contrived the it used to be four states
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:24.640]  and he contrived the wars used his newspapers
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.800]  to create the clashes create the conflicts they provocated the wars in the
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.560]  middle of the night and what they ended up with was south africa
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:38.240]  but that was just the beginning because cecil roads who was a real magnet for
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:42.320]  the diamond and gold mines and everything else that goes with it
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:46.400]  uh started a secret society he left seven wills you can read about this in
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:49.520]  carol quigley's angelo american establishment
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:53.440]  and one of the groups he left behind was alfred millner's
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:57.280]  kindergarten and alfred millner was down there in south africa taking part in
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.600]  all this and but at oxford they have an intellectual group
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.000]  of a steering group for the secret society the same secret society that
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.880]  became the royal institute for international affairs
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:13.280]  the council on foreign relations in the u.s and the other branches of the
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.200]  international affairs institutes in other western countries
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:20.320]  the reason these groups are important is because they covertly
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:24.480]  have steered all these nations which used to be under british control
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:29.040]  and put in place a shadow government in many cases making these countries feel
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.320]  like they had a true uprising and the reason i'm bringing this up is to
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:37.040]  parallel it to egypt you have lionel curtis one of the head
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.880]  of the cecil roads secret society millner kindergarten
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:46.320]  who was also in south africa uh who had interactions with gondy when he started
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.400]  his protest in south africa against the racial
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:54.640]  policies on the first class train tickets against mandatory thumb printing
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.800]  against id cards and all that was really a provocation
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:03.680]  to the larger indian revolution uh that culminated in indian independence in
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:07.680]  1947 the cecil roads secret society particularly through
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:11.280]  lionel curtis really steered that whole thing
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:15.360]  the british who took over india starting in the 1600s
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.200]  and really had gained full control by the mid 1800s
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.560]  really never lost control even through the indian
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.000]  independence they maintained a shadow government behind them
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.440]  and you see this yet again in laurence of arabia
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:35.040]  the famous film by david lean te laurence was also part of the cecil roads
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:38.960]  secret society and they have played both sides and used
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.360]  an underhanded method to take over these regions maintain
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:48.560]  uh british colonial interest while giving uh the local people a sense of their own
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:52.480]  destiny a sense of their own leadership uh you can see that in the film but
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:57.200]  basically t laurence single-handedly uh unites the
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:00.160]  arabs the various arab tribes who are not a
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:03.600]  nation at that point and gets them together during the world war one
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:07.600]  period and wins victory for them only to sell them out in
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:11.600]  negotiations with the treaty of versailles and
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:15.520]  that's very interesting as well now i wanted to play a clip from
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:21.600]  the man who would be king uh 1979 movie it's based on the rudyard kippling
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.640]  a short story by the same name the man who would be king
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:29.120]  rudyard kippling uh was born in india and has been a very large proponent of
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:32.800]  the british colonial system he sort of acknowledged
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.480]  that we were passing the torch to the us and that they would be taking over the
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.720]  empire uh you know rudyard kippling was the
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:45.600]  architect of the white man's burden paradigm where
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.360]  basically defending that white white or
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:53.840]  anglo colonial interest should take over these
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:58.320]  far-reaching parts of the world and influence their affairs because it's
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.120]  just better to do that if we could queue up that clip
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.840]  i hope they have it ready
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:08.240]  this will show you how they play both sides uh they're going to take over
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.760]  a corrupt dictator and uh really have a plan to take over for their own means
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:17.600]  these are two british uh masonic soldiers from the man who would be king
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:22.400]  roll it we're not little men so we're going away to be kings
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:28.000]  kings of kafristown oh kafristown we hear they have two and thirty idols
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.600]  there so we'll be a thirty third and thirty fourth
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.920]  it's a place of warring tribes which is to say a land of opportunities it's a
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:40.800]  place of warring tribes that is to say a land of opportunity we'll go there
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:44.640]  we'll say to any chief we can find do you want to vanquish your faults
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:48.320]  of course you'll say go to it we'll fight for him
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:53.200]  make him king then we'll subvert that king we'll seize israel throne and look
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.320]  the country four ways from sunday as after a plan
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:00.480]  hold it right there so you see they're going to
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:03.920]  approach the local dictator approach the local king
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:06.720]  they're going to tell him do you want to vanquish your foes we'll fight your
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:09.600]  enemies for you this is classic agalean dialectic
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:13.040]  this is how the british empire has worked for literally hundreds of years
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:16.400]  uh this takes place of course back in the mid 1800s
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:20.320]  but it's not that much different of a game today even in the middle east
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:23.760]  uh this is kafristown is in a region basically
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.840]  part of modern day afghanistan and you see they're going to bribe the local
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:31.840]  dictators by fighting his enemies only to later loot him uh continue please
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.680]  he wants to know are you gods not gods englishmen
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:39.600]  which is the next best thing
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.720]  bringing enlightenment to the darker regions of the earth
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.680]  that's the white man's burden
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:49.120]  he wants to know how rifle works
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.240]  come on bitchy
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:02.000]  we are not gods exactly but we are heaven sent
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:08.240]  to deliver you from your enemies
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:12.240]  and i do have to kill you but the enemy is all around
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.440]  the bash guy are the worst red man will give him
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:22.400]  okay hold on like that okay so again you see this local dictator
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.480]  they've shown him the power of their firearms and said you know being
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:29.040]  englishman is almost the next thing to being god
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:33.040]  and they're gonna fight their foes for him that's when this local tribal king
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.880]  uh breaks down he says enemies i have enemies all around
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:40.080]  anything you could do to help me uh go on as they
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.160]  use his ego to win over this local dictator so they can play both sides for
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.440]  greater british control he says uh he give you
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.280]  two gods for each bash guy man's your killing a handsome offer
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.560]  but rather than knocking him over one at a time we like to do the whole thing in
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:00.960]  one fell swoop serve him up a proper victory storm bash guy
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:06.720]  take the city
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.400]  he says how much for all that only the honor of leading the brave men of our
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.000]  head into battle
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.280]  plus whatever we make fans in a way of souvenir looting the country
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:23.680]  mobile here and a pangal there oh
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:27.920]  bash guy is only the beginning we hope to go on from victory to victory
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:34.400]  until he runs out of enemies and a monarch of all use of a from the highest
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:42.480]  place in the valley utah the great utah akbar
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.240]  hey
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.680]  oh he says he prefers utah the terrible then utah the terrible
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.360]  it shall be and i think that's really funny uh
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.880]  utah the great's not good enough he wants to be utah the terrible
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.720]  well whatever you want because they're gonna put a dictator in control but
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.360]  they're really going to be the ones taking over the region
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.960]  and this is just classic great game uh british
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:14.160]  colonial um tension playing two sides against each other to control the
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:17.280]  region and i think in many ways this is what we're
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.640]  still seeing today in the middle east region
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.480]  only now it's not just the british it's also american interest it's israeli
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.960]  interest but they're all combined it's the new
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.120]  world order interest and just because glenn beck talks about
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:36.080]  left-leaning socialist elements in this in the system
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:40.240]  doesn't mean it isn't still the military interests who are calling who gets to be
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.360]  a dictator letting them feel powerful they're
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.360]  going to be utah the terrible but really who's in control will
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:50.800]  remain the u.s british allied interest and that's very
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:54.720]  interesting to see because it's just the brzezinski great
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:59.200]  game it's the kissinger great game it is the way they played out communist
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:02.960]  containment taking over third world countries so they wouldn't fall to
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:06.640]  communism always you have the left hand is the
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:09.920]  enemy the right hand is the savior it's very hegelian
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:13.840]  dialectic you create the problem you provide the solution
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:17.760]  after the population reacts and we can only hope that
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.680]  the populations in egypt will have a true revolution
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:24.960]  and will not fall into greater radicalism
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:28.800]  and that they will have true elections and be able to appoint their own leaders
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.440]  but we know how much of history has gone
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.480]  and it's just very startling to see that game
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:39.520]  um when we come back from break i want to talk more about ron paul he just gave
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:43.760]  a great speech where he says we shouldn't back up dictators anymore
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:47.680]  uh part of his larger theme of bringing home the us empire
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:51.840]  part of the larger theme of not giving foreign aid to all these countries
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:55.760]  only to finance dictators and have them not be our friends later
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:58.960]  and i think it's a great strategy it's very important
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:02.560]  um in fact maybe we should start that clip now and then we'll come back from
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.680]  break with it joining us is a republican congressman
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:08.640]  ron paul of texas he's joining us now from the conservative
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.880]  political action conference here in washington congressman paul thanks very
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:16.640]  much for joining us let's talk about egypt a subject you know quite a bit
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:20.800]  about you've said a controversial remarks that he said the united states is
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:27.600]  egypt is the united states is 30 year mistake now what were you referring to
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.760]  well we've invested a lot of money in the mubarak and uh i don't think it was a
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:35.040]  good investment that it was stable for a while but it was
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.800]  building the resentment and the instability that finally burst out
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.200]  so i would say the 30 of this 70 billion dollars was not worth it
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:47.120]  and that unfortunately many of those dollars ended up in swiss bank accounts
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:51.920]  for his family so i don't i think it was a big mistake and uh we really don't
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:55.520]  have the money to spare and i don't think it does anything for our national
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:58.720]  security so if you add your way the billion and a half
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:02.960]  dollars a year that the u.s provides egypt in military mostly military about
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:06.800]  1.3 billion about another 200 million dollars in economic
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.320]  assistance if you add your way all of that would be gone immediately is that
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:12.960]  what you're saying
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:17.280]  oh yeah i i think so i mean i'm not a believer in foreign aid and you know i
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.840]  sort of liked what eisenhower did in 1956 i was a college student then
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:25.680]  had remembered the korean war and when uh the british and the
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:30.240]  french were uh attacked by the egyptians to take the canal
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.560]  and they went to eisenhower and eisenhower said i don't want to have
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.680]  anything to do with it so i think that was good advice and that's probably the
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:40.080]  way we should have stayed that way and uh we should do a lot less a lot sooner
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.120]  and not waste all this money uh because it
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:46.080]  tends to come back to haunt us it reminds me a little bit about
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.280]  propping up the shaw of the rand just look at that problem then we ended up
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.600]  with the ayatollah so they're not good investments i like the i like the
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:57.520]  founders advice you know be friends with people and trade with people and
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:00.880]  negotiate and get along
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:04.400]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing

[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:15.760]  well we can't really give them a democracy they might elect the wrong
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:19.680]  person see we're all for democracy as long as they pick the right person
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:23.760]  and we just as soon prefer a dictator that will do our bidding and then we give
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:26.800]  them a lot of money i'd like another option rather than either just
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.600]  bombing people or giving them money i would say
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:33.520]  friendship and and diplomacy is a much better way to go
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:37.840]  i mean this army was built by us in the military industrial complex loved it
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.720]  they made a lot of money off that but the army was there to
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:44.480]  for all those 30 years was to protect mubarak it wasn't for national defense
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.320]  purposes so that's our army 450 000 troops that we
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:51.760]  more or less was uh i was just going to say administration
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:54.560]  officials going back to republican administrations whether
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:58.320]  bush or reagan or democratic administrations the current one
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:01.360]  or or bill clinton's administration they'll argue
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:05.040]  this military assistance to egypt is a good investment in the united states
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:08.560]  because egypt was an ally a strategic partner
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.320]  and cooperated with us in the war on terror for example
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.080]  so this was money well spent that's the argument we've here heard now for 30
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:19.440]  years well yeah but i think our current events
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:23.600]  proved my point it wasn't well spent because it ended up in chaos and we
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.920]  don't know who the next dictator is going to be
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:29.760]  and it helped contribute to our bankruptcy so i would say maybe the next
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.600]  maybe the next leader of egypt well but but if the next leader of egypt
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:37.680]  congressman is a democratically elected leader popular
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:41.200]  and doing all the right things there wouldn't necessarily be a dictator why
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:44.160]  do we have to say the next day of egypt's going to be a dictator
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.720]  yeah that would be great but i i i personally believe
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.080]  that the odds of that happening are much better if we're not there
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:55.600]  picking up and picking and the individuals to spend our money on it
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:59.920]  so i'm for that i just don't believe that the best way to do is get in there
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:03.840]  and finance the military the military right now of course is dependent on us
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:07.200]  and the military is in charge so we really own the country right now
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.440]  all right let's stop right there okay that is ron paul
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:16.000]  very hopefully talking it's very hopeful to me rather that they can finally talk
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.200]  about cutting military spending bringing home the troops
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:24.640]  ending this overseas foreign empire and the conservative movement at cpac
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.640]  really has shown that they're behind ron paul on this and they see through the
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:31.600]  neocon game and they've had enough of the cheney and
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:34.960]  rumsfeld types i've just gotten word that we are
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:39.760]  change has confronted uh dick cheney you can look for that tomorrow
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.840]  but for today we can really hope that uh we won't continue to destabilize the
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.400]  region to fund these dictators and to fund supposedly democratic
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:54.960]  movements only to see them go astray it's very good that we're talking
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:59.040]  about bringing ourselves back to a nation-based
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:04.000]  constitution-based system and i i'm just excited to see ron paul
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.680]  talking about that and that issue being on the table
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:11.360]  if you go to gcn live you can read terrorists who trained
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:16.320]  london bombers was working for u.s government more evidence that the 77
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:20.800]  plot was just another case of fbi mi-6 intelligence
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:25.040]  provocaturing sting operations where they give them the bombs
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:28.560]  it's disgusting the way this war on terrorists supposed to continue
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:33.360]  that we're supposed to clamp down at home and continue foment and chaos overseas
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:38.240]  it's probably not a good long-term strategy for true u.s dominance and i
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.320]  think we'd be wise to reconsider that

[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:38.160]  it's funny we were talking about this last night before i saw this news article
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:42.320]  this morning because i ran into carl roe but a restaurant
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:45.280]  and we were talking about when are they gonna arrest this guy for war crimes
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.640]  how can bush brag that he ordered torture he said it again in two
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:52.720]  two speeches last year but then send people in the military to prison who
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:56.320]  were caught torturing uh and we know that they've talked in spain
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:59.920]  about and dining cheney you know will will bush end up being locked up in the
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:05.040]  us kind of like uh people like chelchescu or you know

[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:19.920]  oh and i probably should introduce you uh you're a former uh a military man
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:23.440]  uh from the vietnam era and then of course you were the top presidential
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.400]  briefer to ronald reagan george herbert walker bush and you've been a big
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:30.080]  critic of the lies about wmds and famously confronted
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:33.120]  rumsfeld he tried to lie and say that he hadn't said that and
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:37.280]  you certainly scared him there uh and you've done so much more but uh thank
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:42.880]  you for coming on with us uh let's briefly get into the situation in egypt
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.040]  well alex there's an elephant in that living room
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:53.280]  and the name of the elephant is israel and surprise surprise no one in this
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:57.680]  country is talking about it this is an incredible
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:02.160]  blow not only to the united states but to israel
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:06.960]  they had depended on having a very safe frontier with
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:12.480]  egypt since the accord where egypt recognized israel
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:16.320]  and that's a long time ago and they had taken it for granted and all of a
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:20.560]  sudden whoa their strategic calculations are upset
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:25.360]  by this popular revolt in egypt so the real question is
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:31.600]  what will the israelis do now you know people say well they can't do
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.600]  anything they'll sit back and watch what happens right
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:40.240]  that's the way they operate number one they'll operate through their
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.280]  well how shall i say their their supporters here in the united states
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:50.240]  and this is one main reason why uh hillary clinton and our president have
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.200]  been waffling for the last week or 10 days
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:57.280]  not knowing whether to say you know bark needs to get out or
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:02.080]  oh maybe you can deal with this uh vice president who's a well-known torturer
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:06.080]  you know it's really been painful watching the twos and froes and the
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.320]  unspoken uh the the factor that can never be
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:14.560]  spoken on mainline tv is what this means to the israelis
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:18.880]  and how israeli supporters in this country are putting the screws on
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:22.480]  barack on barack obama again to make sure
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:25.680]  that he doesn't do anything they will make that part of the world
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:31.760]  still riskier for israel and now the la times reports a bunch of us ships
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:36.240]  are steaming into the area and on top of that
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.680]  we're getting reports that marines are being deployed
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:44.560]  into egypt they claim for evacuations do you buy that
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:48.080]  no i don't buy that i think the marines want to be
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:52.320]  want to be prepared to follow orders as they always do
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:56.080]  i don't think that the u.s. personages are in any danger
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:00.720]  there may be a you know back up at the airport but none of the protesters have
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:04.720]  have said they're going to do any harm to u.s. officials or tourists who remain
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:07.840]  there so this is a pretty ominous thing i hadn't gotten
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:11.600]  confirmation about these marine moves but that's what marines do
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.720]  and if we move ark decides to make a last stand
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:18.000]  he'll be supported not only by marines from our country
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:21.840]  but by all manner of support from israel which knows how to do this by the
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:26.960]  way and our only stunts throw away well we've had the british go into suez in
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:31.040]  the past and it is the business insider reporting on the marine
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:34.560]  situation but if they if they admit they're sending ships
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:38.160]  would marines go along with that and that's who comes off the ships
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:41.360]  yeah depending what kind of ships of course they can always justify the
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:45.920]  ships by a sensible danger to the suez
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:49.760]  canal we'll have to see how that plays out because i don't
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:53.680]  think the administration here knows what it's doing
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:05:00.960]  stay there let's finish up with egypt then get into bush arrest fears
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:04.560]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:09.760]  it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:12.480]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:15.680]  and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:18.400]  worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either

[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.280]  america today
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:07.040]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:12.560]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:15.840]  that's right the united states has been captured by big
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:19.680]  offshore corporations they're totally ruthless all over the world
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:23.120]  these multinationals have funded dictatorships corrupt
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:28.640]  bureaucracies to basically feed on top of their populations
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:32.400]  and the people are rebelling in egypt
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:35.680]  the establishment obviously recognized that and has said
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:39.600]  that they are funding the opposition i guess so they
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:46.160]  are still in control if hazi mubarak is forced out sooner than
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:51.600]  september and rey mcgovern of course top ci analyst ronald reagan and george
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:56.240]  bush senior he was also in the military during
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:01.440]  the vietnam war and we always appreciate him
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:06.240]  joining us he's made a lot of really accurate predictions i remember
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:09.920]  about a year and a half before it happened he said well i would look for
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:15.680]  cheney in the neocons to try to stage a gulf of tonkin situation to get into
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:20.640]  war with iran then about a year later that happened
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:24.960]  and then a year after that we learned that it had been a staged event
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:28.720]  so just amazing and so we need to listen up when he tells us what he thinks is
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:32.880]  really going on in egypt and where he thinks the situation is going
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:36.240]  what's happening with these pipelines going these gas pipelines into jordan
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:40.320]  and israel being blown up what the overall geopolitical
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:44.560]  ramifications are and not just briefing presidents he's now briefing us
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:48.000]  tell us again what's going on in egypt
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.600]  well alex uh it's very very complicated um
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:57.520]  the main factor really is that the the broad public support uh the
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:02.000]  revolutionaries or the uprising people uh are
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.800]  numerous but they seem to lack a coherent leadership
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:11.360]  the only bright light there is el-baraday the former
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:16.480]  chief u n inspector the head of the international atomic energy agency
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.560]  who has wide respect abroad as well as in egypt
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:25.840]  a reluctant draftee so to speak but he has said that he would be willing to
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:28.720]  lead now and form an interim government
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.000]  so that's the good news the bad news of course is that
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.400]  for israel and the united states el-baraday is poisoned
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:42.640]  why because oddly this statesman insists on telling the truth
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:47.120]  he was the one that has said all along that there is no real evidence that iran
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:51.040]  is working on a nuclear weapon and he should know his inspectors are
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:55.440]  crawling all over that country and he was the one you may recall
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:11:02.880]  back in march or april of 2003 who testified or is watching it live i'll
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:07.280]  never forget it testified before the u n security council and said
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:13.040]  you know those reports those reports that iraq was seeking a european
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:19.280]  take uranium from nigeria we have looked into it and in two days we found
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:25.280]  that they are not authentic not authentic they were forgeries
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:30.720]  forgeries by i think the chinese folks so the guy is poisoned the u.s tried to
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:34.800]  get him removed from his post in the iae 8 without success
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:38.000]  so where does that leave us well that leaves us with a
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.880]  with a very fearful israel stoking up fears in the united states
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:46.480]  about these uh those muslims you know these these muslim
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:50.320]  terrorists that could take over kairu which is a
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:52.800]  red herring they're never going to do that in egypt
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:57.520]  egypt is a country of 80 million people you know the rest is small fry
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:01.680]  egypt is so big the israel i think will have to
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:05.920]  determine what it's going to do and what it's going to do frightens me because
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:11.200]  it is all kinds of possibilities including well let me put it this way
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:16.720]  alex say if i were in a butter they i would insist on a whole platoon
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:20.560]  of soldiers and bodyguards around me rather than just the 10
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:27.680]  that exist now now ray what's the stratagem of disinformation then
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:35.040]  having the ap the london telegraph come out and say that the u.s is behind
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:38.720]  albarity and basically triggered this is that an attempt
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:45.200]  knowing that if the west and israel claim that albarity somehow works for them
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:51.280]  that that will discredit him uh at home in a country tired of foreign
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:55.200]  domination through the propped up dictator hazing mubarak who cheney is
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:59.200]  calling a great guy who uh and a good man who we should
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:03.520]  respect yeah alex if i were you know giving references
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.920]  for a job i don't i don't think i'd include dig cheney on my reference list
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:12.000]  yeah that speaks volumes doesn't it cheney thinks he's a great guy
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:17.040]  um your your initial point was having to do with the
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:21.760]  i forget now well no i mean the medias of the media yeah i'll be claiming that
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:26.640]  albarity is is backed by the u.s. yeah well you know there's all kinds of
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:31.280]  disinformation campaigns out there to discredit somebody like abadadi
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:34.800]  and you can be sure that we have our quote assets
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:39.600]  end quote in some of the more conservative the newspapers and magazines in
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:42.720]  britain and elsewhere and so you can expect them to
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.760]  sell all kinds of confusion the egyptian people know what abadadi is
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:51.200]  and what he isn't and that's what counts here
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:54.800]  the only problem is getting organized to the point where they
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:58.880]  they can actually uh face into the new vice president
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:05.120]  named by mubarak who by the way uh is the cia and israeli
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:11.280]  checkpoint their liaison guy not only that but he was the fellow in egypt
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:18.240]  that handle the uh... uh... the transfer of people that we wanted to get
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:21.360]  tortured uh renditions is what we call it
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:25.680]  the kind of nice super cat uh... yeah renditions and
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:30.080]  there was one particularly flagrant rendition
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:35.040]  uh... and this is worth recalling to mind the fellow's name was alibi because
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:38.480]  he came from libya okay and he had some sort of
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:42.560]  job with the training camps for al-qaeda it seems that he was sort of like
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:46.000]  the travel agent you know he would rain but repair tickets for people who want
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.600]  to come in and train he wasn't anywhere near close to
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:53.280]  to osama bin laden or salihiri or the others
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:56.400]  but they caught him okay and then before the war
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:01.200]  the premium was on getting somebody to quote confess and quote
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:05.440]  that's not a busain was training al-qaeda operatives
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:09.680]  and unconventional weapons okay yeah and the fake airplanes it turned out
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:14.240]  none of that was true yeah right so he got the alibi
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:19.440]  and he won't quote confess and quote and so they take them to to they send them
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:25.520]  off to al-sulaman the current egyptian vice president
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:29.120]  and they say you know you guys are better at this than we are
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:33.600]  and what we need to do is make sure we find out that
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:38.560]  salah mussein was training al-qaeda operatives and that alibi knew that
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:42.720]  because he was running the travel agency and guess what alex you'll never
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:47.440]  guess what but the egyptians can succeeded in doing that
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:52.560]  the cable went back to uh to washington the next day the president
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.720]  the vice president and later colvin powell before the u. n
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:02.880]  spun this tale as proof that soto voce salah mussein had some sort of
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:08.240]  tie with 911 because he was training al-qaeda operatives and that is only
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:12.960]  one of the thousands of admitted crimes and lies and deception
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:18.000]  uh shifting gears because you don't have a lot of time left with you uh uh uh ray
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.680]  let's go back to who was involved at this time bush cheney carl rove the
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:26.400]  architect uh alberta gonzalez putting out memos they could torture people
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:31.840]  including crushing children's genitals and now bush came out last year
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:35.840]  and in two different speeches and his book said i'd order tortured again
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:40.560]  uh so this is admittedly illegal there have been calls for at least carl rove
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:44.160]  over alberta gonzalez or john you to be brought up on war crimes
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:47.280]  but now we have the times of india other publications reporting bush fears
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.040]  arrest scraps swiss visit he was set to give a keynote
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:55.120]  address and had agreed to do it is now canceled the february 12th
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:59.760]  uh speech uh before we get into this recapping the international admitted
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:02.720]  crimes that were committed here the lives of w md's
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:06.560]  the downing street memo the white house memo i was at a restaurant last night
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:11.600]  carl rove sat down right next to us here in austin and i just couldn't eat what
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:14.880]  we got upset i'm not eating in the same room with somebody like hitler
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:17.840]  and we left uh it was a private place so i didn't want to start screaming at him
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:21.280]  in there uh but do you think i handled that right what would you have said to
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:25.120]  him well what i would have done alex is a qual code pink
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:30.480]  very quick uh they have handcuffs and they have courage the courage that
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:34.880]  continues to amaze me they have tried to arrest him at his book signings
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:38.640]  and what needs to happen is somebody needs to put the cuffs on him because he
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:41.920]  can be extradited and subjected to justice
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:45.600]  our government doesn't have the guts to do it but the spaniards
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.240]  the french the germans they all may under the principle of universal
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:54.800]  jurisdiction which briefly means that if the government who is harboring these
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:57.840]  criminals is unwilling to proceed against them in a legal
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:01.760]  fashion then under the convention against torture
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:06.320]  any government can initiate traditional proceedings
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:09.840]  now that's why george bush this is really amazing we have word
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:13.520]  late friday night that george bush had cancelled
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:18.480]  out of this appearance in geneva scheduled for february 12th and we
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:21.840]  learned from the center for constitutional rights
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:26.880]  that they and their european counterparts had assembled 2,500 pages
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:31.600]  worth of indictment on george bush and we're ready to serve it
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:35.760]  to the prosecutor in geneva now this is serious stuff
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:39.040]  you're so like you are so long you're separately here on air
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:42.560]  all we've got is a blurb in the times of india you're confirming
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:47.520]  that indeed this did go on and you have the bona fides yeah yeah please continue
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:51.920]  we've been in touch with the center for constitutional rights it almost worked
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:55.600]  someone someone leaked the fact that this thing had been given to the
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:59.840]  prosecutors in geneva and what bush did was cancel right away
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:04.240]  now the white house or the bush should spokespeople are saying well now he
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:07.040]  he had heard that there would be demonstrations and he didn't want to
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:10.480]  you know he didn't want to burden the swiss police
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:14.240]  well boulder dash but he was afraid it was getting detained
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:18.160]  and actually brought to the hate for trial now unless
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:21.440]  the less people think that this is far-fetched
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:28.720]  this happened before on october 26 2007 again the center for constitutional
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:32.720]  rights are really gutsy organization filed a petition
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:36.800]  with the with the prosecutor in paris donald rumsfeld
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:41.120]  happened to be in paris at the time these things need to be taken seriously
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.360]  witnessed the fact that don rumsfeld went out the back door of the embassy
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:49.360]  drove off the orly airport or the old airport and was on the first plane back
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:52.960]  to the united states canceled all his appearances
[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:57.920]  so you know the sad thing is that obama doesn't have the guts to do the right
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:03.120]  thing well raise stay there let's continue to look at this on the

[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:23.680]  dealing with pull shift people keep wanting me to talk about it
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:27.920]  paul watson's written a big article pull shift threatens to cause weather chaos
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:31.440]  that's what nasa and people are saying fox news reporting or having to
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:35.760]  recalibrate airport gps it's pretty strange so i'm
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:40.000]  going to give you my take on it uh coming up after ray leaves us ray i
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:43.360]  think it's so important here for those that don't know the history
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:47.200]  or those that might have forgotten it to recap briefly
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:50.960]  all the different war crimes i mean the the knowingly lying about wmd is the
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:55.360]  ordering of torture the secret arrest the the rendition uh the white house
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.360]  memos where the president is above the law i mean nixon tried that saying
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:01.840]  when it's the president breaking the law it's not illegal
[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:06.320]  that was proven to be a fraud if they are able to operate and set the president
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:09.280]  of doing this and we know obama's continuing the rendition
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:12.720]  then there is no bill of rights there is no constitution but worse than that
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:15.760]  we are tyrants because we're allowing it to happen and
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:19.840]  absolutely you know by pointing out that that's probably why bush has bottled
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:24.000]  that land in in uruguay or whatever that that that they are criminals that
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.040]  begins to put the idea in people's minds that they must be brought to justice
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:31.840]  but briefly recapping the crimes of these people
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:36.240]  well um you know how much time we have got about five minutes here but
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:40.720]  and then we'll come back yeah i uh i just of course because you could go for
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:46.000]  45 minutes just listening to them as dennis kusukinich to his great credit
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:51.840]  did do 35 35 articles of impeachment uh he
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:55.920]  read them it took six or seven hours on the floor of the house but he did that
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:00.080]  they're on the record that you can get them from war is a crime dot org
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:03.600]  you know the ones you mentioned are the more obvious ones
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:08.720]  also starting a war of aggression uh which was outlawed was banned after war
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:12.320]  war two and in numerous international documents
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:18.000]  but you know one of the things that toward the end i think it's article 33
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:23.760]  and 34 that talks about his uh at best his complete
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:27.280]  incompetence in handling the intelligence information that was
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:31.440]  available before 9 11 and that was that was criminal
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:35.520]  that was malfeasance not just misbeisance and then
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:41.600]  the lying about what he was told now not many people know that george tenet the
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:47.120]  head of the cia lie under oath during the 9 11 commission proceedings
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:51.120]  when uh one of the congressman on the commission asked him
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:54.800]  uh george what did you say to the president during the month of august
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:59.680]  2001 he's always had no contact with the president i never saw him
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:04.640]  and well how about telephone no no no he was on you know he's down cropper and i
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:09.760]  was on him well turns out that tenet saw the president
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:14.720]  on the 17th of august and on the 24th of august
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:18.320]  and on the 31st of august so he lied under oath
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:22.560]  his statesman or his spokesman a little while later oh yeah yeah he yared
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:26.320]  but that's what was on tv why did he err because tenet
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:31.840]  however incompetent he was did tell him about that the threat that the
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:36.160]  islamic terrorists were learning to fly airplanes
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:39.680]  he followed up on the president's daily brief item and so
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:43.440]  there's lots in those indictments that just show that the president
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:46.560]  and those who served him first and foremost
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:50.160]  the sycophant george tenet lied under oath and
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:54.320]  and you know there are lots of things that were in the articles of impeachment
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:59.040]  against president nixon three articles which are also very operative
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:02.400]  underbush the difference is that john kinyers had some guts
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:08.000]  back in the 1970s john kinyers is now an old part of the establishment and
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.480]  didn't want to risk uh democratic gains in the
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:17.440]  by-election of 2006 and of course going back to the condoleezza rise from a
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:20.720]  memo where they said we didn't hear a plan to fly planes in the buildings
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:23.200]  and then it turned out bin laden determined to attack
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:27.520]  and that the fbi memos even said fly planes in the world trade center
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:30.480]  so they lied about that they knew and they stood down
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:33.760]  yeah they didn't do anything now the charitable explanation is that they
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:37.840]  were just completely incompetent there's lots of reasons to
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:41.040]  believe that there's a more sinister explanation but
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:45.040]  none of them uh to my you know my investigative mind
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:48.720]  are conclusive just yet the other thing that needs to be mentioned of course
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:52.080]  is that there is a memorandum released by attorney general
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:57.280]  alberto gonzalez which shows that george bush on the 7th of February
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:01.520]  wow it's the anniversary isn't it the 7th of
[02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:05.600]  February 2002 approved torture what he said was
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:10.080]  we don't have to obey the genevi conventions we will treat prisoners
[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:14.080]  quote um what was the words he used uh
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:18.240]  human yeah quote humanely as appropriate
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:22.400]  and as consistent with military necessity period
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:26.800]  end quote that's what geneva says the president can't
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:30.960]  get just the precinct from geneva and that's what he did and then we got the
[02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:34.160]  more detailed memos where they talked about what can we do
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:38.160]  well we can bury people alive yeah we can torture children from their parents
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:41.680]  yeah rama governs stay there i want to talk about
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:45.200]  where this is going with an american president not able to travel to europe
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:49.280]  this is a big deal stay with us we'll be right back then i'm getting into the
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:55.040]  other big news item we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.000]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.480]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:14.320]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:17.520]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:21.040]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:24.720]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:27.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:31.600]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:34.720]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:38.160]  their power from weather-related onages number five a solar power
[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:41.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind

[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:12.800]  agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:15.920]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:19.920]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:25.200]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:28.400]  fall the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:32.800]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:32:32.800 --> 02:32:36.080]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:39.120]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches
[02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:42.560]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:46.000]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:05.840]  i would stand in line for this
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:10.800]  there's always room in life for this
[02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:16.960]  know me friends as a journalist and senior fellow
[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:20.240]  at demos and we're going to be talking the best-selling author here in just a
[02:33:20.240 --> 02:33:23.520]  moment she's an insider goldman sax whistleblower we're
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:27.680]  honored to have her but i said i'd play this clip uh this is
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:31.520]  uh barack obama during the campaign said at many times so did the vice
[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:34.960]  president biden that they wanted to bankrupt power plants
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:38.880]  in america meanwhile they're not pressuring china who builds a whole
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:43.040]  bunch of them you know every month to have any controls on theirs
[02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:46.720]  and now we're having rolling blackouts because of this and we have the
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:50.880]  article obama's blocking of new power plants triggers nationwide blackouts
[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:57.120]  and the big issue here is insiders at GE now heading up as economic council the
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:00.560]  former head of GE they get waivers from all this so it's another unfair trade
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:03.520]  advantage just like insiders getting waivers from having to buy health
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:06.880]  insurance for their employees like mcdonald's i mean this is mafia
[02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:10.320]  government where you get the favors from the mafia government that's why they
[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:14.080]  want to have authoritarian control nothing to do with environmentalism
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:17.840]  so here is that clip of obama saying he wants to bankrupt
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:22.400]  uh power plants that is an act of war of economic sabotage
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:25.520]  but that's what goldman sax and jp morgan and GE
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:28.560]  these guys are all about using government to shut down their competition
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:33.200]  so they can vertically integrate markets here's the clip
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:38.400]  of uh so if somebody wants to build a coal power plant they can
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:41.680]  it's just that it will bankrupt them because
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:49.440]  they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:53.920]  being emitted now obama was not drunk there our
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:58.320]  computer played it in slow time for some reason but
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:01.840]  it's only a 13-second clip we're gonna we're gonna try to play that
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:06.000]  clip for folks one more time but you can just search obama says he'll bankrupt
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.880]  plants you'll see many other clips of him online
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:12.560]  in different speeches here it is so if somebody wants to build a coal power
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:15.920]  plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:20.080]  they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:24.640]  greenhouse gas that's being emitted okay there you go they're going to
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:28.320]  bankrupt them now this dovetails with what uh
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:31.520]  no me prince has been talking about and of course
[02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:35.120]  her latest book is it takes a pillage behind the bonus bailouts
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:37.840]  and backroom deals from washington to wall street
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:40.640]  and of course he's also the author of other people's money the corporate
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:44.080]  mugging of america she wrote that uh six and a half years ago in
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.440]  october of 2004 a devastating expose into corporate
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:51.120]  corruption political collusion and wall street deception that's why the big
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:54.640]  megabanks and the insiders want big government because they can shut down
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:57.120]  their competition before becoming a journalist
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:00.160]  no me worked in wall street as a managing director at goldman sacks
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:03.760]  and running the international analytics group at bare sterns in london

[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.560]  honored to have you you heard me just getting into the
[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:36.160]  power plants being shut down that aren't insiders with the government
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:39.200]  that pretty much integrates with what you've been talking about
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:44.080]  about this rigged planned insider crony capitalist system what should take
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:48.400]  before we get into the larger issues on these power plants being shut down from
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:51.680]  georgia to texas and now blackouts everywhere
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:54.800]  well i mean that's the thing that what what uh what you're talking about what
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:58.160]  he was talking about is that if you don't have the money to effectively
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:01.600]  create your own loophole and work it out with the government
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.840]  is as one of the larger power companies like like g
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:09.520]  then you're going to not be able to operate and as a result
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:14.240]  that consolidates the power um no pun actually pun intended
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:18.160]  into a handful of few companies which is pretty much how corporate america works
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:22.320]  we are a nation in which the corporations have
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:26.160]  continued to merge have continued to consolidate
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:29.840]  power and therefore control and access to government and collusion with the
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:35.200]  government in order to yes get rid of competition
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:38.880]  and also control markets and whether those markets are with power
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:42.720]  or those markets are with with finances or those markets are with
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:48.240]  loans to homeowners it's all really part of the system where
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:51.920]  companies really not just control but are gaining
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:56.800]  every day more control over all the things that touch our lives
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:00.800]  absolutely and and this is a rigged rigged system and that's what the
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:05.760]  globalist admitted davos they want uh is a global system they control where
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:09.280]  they control the rules for their advantage and
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:12.400]  from my perspective it's purely a mafia tactic
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:16.960]  uh what would you call this system well it is you talk about the mafia
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:22.560]  as uh extracting money um from various small businesses in order to have
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:25.200]  garbage pick up you know in front of their businesses and then the list of
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:27.280]  course goes on and on but you're effectively
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:32.240]  extracting income in order to basically control a certain set of
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:35.200]  of practices and the united states government
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:38.080]  does really the same thing except it goes through the form of lobbyists and
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:41.680]  campaign contributors so it's basically the bigger company is
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:44.720]  the more they can pay for lobbyists the more they can pay for lawyers for
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:47.600]  accountants for everyone else to not just create laws
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:51.040]  but get around laws and and find their own loopholes and basically
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:54.640]  suggest laws that have loopholes in them for them to use
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:58.640]  and they have the funds to do that and you know we we still have a system where
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:01.680]  the supreme court is fine with that recently uh
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:06.000]  confirm the fact that they're fine with um campaign contributions coming through
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:09.440]  corporations obviously lobbyists are going in and out of
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:13.600]  washington and in many instances like with the head of g now they don't even
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:18.000]  have to um it's not even really an issue they're just on the advisory board of
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:21.840]  the obama administration and it's not uh just the obama
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:24.480]  administration of course with any administration is just the one that's
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:29.040]  currently operating um and that's really how the money not just gets
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:34.480]  consolidated on the profit of these companies but gets used to
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:38.960]  infiltrate our our laws create their own loopholes and
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:43.200]  facilitate their own uh future profits because of that
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:46.880]  nomi i could talk to you as a former goldman sacks managing director for
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:51.120]  10 hours there's so many things to discuss but on your radar screen right
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:54.640]  now i saw you on max keiser a few days ago it's actually gonna air tomorrow but
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:58.400]  he played an exclusive clip here of you basically saying yeah this is
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:01.600]  insider trading just with the or borders on it
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:05.680]  with the facebook goldman sacks uh or or jp morgan deal there's a lot of
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:11.440]  different deals uh that are uh going on uh right now but but
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:14.400]  what is most important on your radar screen that you want to warn people
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:17.920]  about you know being somebody who's been an insider and really knows how things
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:22.160]  work well i think um yeah you mentioned the facebook deal and and that's
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:25.760]  that's only important because it just demonstrates how um
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:31.040]  goldman sacks after having um created itself into a bank holding company
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:36.560]  basically the type of a bank that is supposed to administer
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:40.800]  deposits for its customers to provide loans for its customers those customers
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:43.680]  not being millionaires of course but being regular individuals which are the
[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:47.440]  customers of goldman sacks however the name of it as a bank holding company
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:52.160]  which it became in the fall of 2008 enabled it to have federal support from
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:56.960]  the fed from the treasury department from the fd ic um and enabled it to carry
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:41:01.120]  on its trading with our support with our federal
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:04.880]  support um which it should not be doing and and that's just an example of how
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:08.720]  a company uses a government when it needs the government in terms of funding
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:14.400]  it at the brink of a bankruptcy which it stood at in in uh the fall of 2008 um
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:17.840]  and then says you know the heck with you guys we're just going to go off
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:22.880]  shore do what we want raise money for our private deals and if the sdc is going
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:25.040]  to ask us questions we're just going to take them off
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:28.160]  shore and go somewhere we don't have any questions because those questions are
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:32.320]  annoying they get in the way of us you know raising fees and gaining our
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:35.680]  profits and we're just going to go around and so you have this global
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:39.600]  system which enables companies like goldman like morgan stanley like jp
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:44.880]  morgan like like any international conglomerate um to find the place where the regulations
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:49.200]  are going to be weakest for that particular deal that particular day that particular
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:54.240]  practice um in which they are going to be involved and and that's that's really
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:57.600]  a big problem with the system right now for example in egypt
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:01.040]  um one of the things that that i was looking at and i'm by no means
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:05.280]  uh a middle eastern scholar um so i preface this with that
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:11.120]  but a lot of the more recent economic problems that egypt and other countries
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:15.360]  in the millis have had have been due to the fact that they have pursued
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:18.960]  opening their borders to international speculators
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:23.120]  and international capital and international banks buying up portions of
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:26.320]  their land and portions of their financial system and of course when
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:30.800]  international capital comes into a country um it's there for a bet it's
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:34.000]  there for a short time it's there to find the best hot deal
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:39.840]  and it leaves as soon as um it's not making a good return on on it staying
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:42.480]  there and that's what's happened to a large extent
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:47.040]  in egypt in particular egypt was one of um according to the world bank
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:50.240]  and the international financial corporation which operates with the
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:54.880]  world bank um one of the top ten what they call reformers
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:58.720]  um reformers to them are not reforming their countries economics for their
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:02.160]  citizens they mean reforming their borders to allow
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:06.400]  speculative capital to come in and go out as freely as possible
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:11.280]  and it was in their top ten last for ten list for four out of the last five
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:14.240]  years um and the results of course when the worldwide
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:19.440]  depression started is that the money that came in equally left as quickly if
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:23.120]  not more so leaving a lot of further economic devastation to the citizens
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:27.280]  of that country um in its wake and then that's besides the corrupt
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:30.720]  dictatorship and and the regime that has been there for 29 years but this is
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:37.280]  really the more recent um effect of this this global domination of
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:40.800]  international capital to like to find itself wherever
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:47.280]  the borders are most um amenable to that no no me you talk about the worldwide
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:50.320]  depression i've had countless other prestigious
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:52.960]  economists on and they've agreed that we i mean even
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:56.160]  sticklets two three years ago nobel prize winner and we were going into a
[02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:59.840]  depression by every yardstick unemployment is 20 plus percent here
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:02.880]  30 in california the government lies and says it's
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:08.480]  9.6 9.7 you know as somebody who's been inside of the you know the heart of
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:12.080]  goldman sacks who's who's since then written and researched this
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:15.360]  from your research what's the real state of the world economy
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:21.280]  and where are we headed the real state of the world economy is that individuals
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:25.520]  are finding themselves less able to to make a living if they had a living and
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:28.960]  falling into the poverty levels of their respective countries more and more
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:34.240]  quickly and that's a direct result of trading and and of bank
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:38.960]  capital and hedge funds and private equity funds finding spots and sort of
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:43.040]  pillaging them to to use the term of my book but really pillaging
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:46.640]  whole economies for whether it's commodities whether it's
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:51.920]  um to turn a population into shady loans and to package those loans up into
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:55.600]  toxic assets and and leave the waste to the federal reserve and the rest of the
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:59.920]  country those are things that the financial industry in
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:03.280]  particular the financial industry is part of every other industry i mean i
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:06.800]  i focus on banks having been inside of banks but there's no company
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:10.640]  there's no large conglomerate that doesn't work with the large financial
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:17.520]  institutions to find ways around you know paying taxes creating
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:21.040]  long sustaining jobs in the areas into which
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:25.920]  they infiltrate because there's no need for them to do so
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:31.520]  and so the state of the world um is really captive
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:36.400]  to that type of of international financial strategies that continue to get
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:40.080]  worse and there's a why no no we go ahead
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:44.160]  no and that's why you know you see in the middle east all of those countries
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:47.600]  have on record somewhere between 10 and 16 percent
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:50.720]  unemployment but just like the united states where we have on record as you
[02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:55.120]  said 9.4 percent right now on employment that that does not in any way
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:59.680]  capture uh the underemployment the the jobs that are not
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:05.680]  sufficient to even cover health care or or rent or rising costs of food and
[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:09.280]  other types of commodities because they just don't stretch as far even when
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:12.000]  people have them and so you know if you look at the
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:16.720]  underemployment statistics they're they're in double digits and rising and
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:20.880]  that couples with the squeezing of prices and
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:25.760]  any type of commodity um and any type of financial service or any type of
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:29.360]  service throughout the world has the effect of squeezing
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:34.000]  people financially even further and and there's no barriers to that the
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:37.760]  the depression the worldwide depression that started
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:41.520]  um with you know what we call the crisis of 2008 was something that was
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:45.200]  really building up for many years for individuals not
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:49.520]  seeing jobs seeing prices get well that's right you predicted it in your 2004
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:53.280]  book and and and there's a method of this madness these big central banks
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:56.640]  who of course the shareholders are private central banks and and and
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:01.760]  families and shareholders they are openly
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:05.040]  dollar devaluing worldwide knowing that that would cause
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:08.640]  record food prices that then puts pressure on countries like
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:12.160]  egypt and then they offer the solution now admitting that they sent in
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:15.360]  albarity to start the revolt two weeks ago
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:19.840]  so uh back when sticklets quit in 2002 we got those thousands of pages
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:23.280]  of imf and world bank documents that bbc reported on
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:27.760]  and right there they said once we get a country under our control
[02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:31.520]  then we further bankrupt them then there's riots then that destroys
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:35.520]  confidence then we can come in and buy up things even cheaper
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:40.160]  and so they have a real stake in the pillaging uh putting the populations
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:43.600]  under their control into a servile position so they can come back and
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:47.840]  pillage them and basically in a mercantile uh
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:52.480]  neocolonial way conquer them uh what's the mindset of a goldman sacks what's
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:55.040]  the mindset of these pillagers what's their
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:58.560]  in game strategy because now they're saying they openly want world government
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:01.920]  a new global cashless currency that all of their currencies are
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:07.440]  dominated in run by private central bankers well that's the private central
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:10.880]  banks are the friends of the international
[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:14.880]  private banks because they yes they they allow for easy funding
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:20.640]  to trade and the motive for everything goldman sacks does is purely profit it
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:25.920]  it it's not obviously doing god's work it's it's not trying to create jobs it's
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:28.960]  not trying to stick around in regions and actually
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:33.280]  have a fair economic system meaning fair for the population of those particular
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:37.200]  regions it's in to get a good deal and it's in to get out
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:41.440]  really as soon as it can possibly do so as soon as it's churned
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:44.880]  whatever that good deal is i mentioned in a in a recent piece actually i think i
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:50.320]  might on my uh blog about for example in early 2008 when
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:54.240]  things were really getting obviously bad with the subprime
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:58.080]  lending and intoxic acid creation on the back of that here in the united states
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:02.320]  that there were uk arms for example of goldman sacks
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:07.920]  buying up pieces of luxury real estate developers in egypt you know sort of
[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:13.040]  trying to squeeze at that particular moment the last drops of what was the
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:17.280]  end of a real estate speculation boom which will which will re-boom again but
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:20.800]  which now is in its um it's in its lower stages
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:24.640]  and and and so that's the mentality mentalities where
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:29.920]  can i go where can i trade where can i get investors and see them
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:33.680]  to trade with me in order to make as much as i can
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:37.280]  as fast as i can and they're doing this a lot to what happens
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:41.120]  in the wake of that where do you see the derivatives bubble going because
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:44.480]  there's no way to get rid of that black hole but they've sold us on this
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:48.000]  too big to fail so now they've tied the treasure the pensions
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:53.360]  of the entire world to their Ponzi scheme well and not only that the financial
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:58.320]  reform bill um and i loosely use the term reform it's it's not a reform bill
[02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:02.320]  but the thing that passed um in congress and was signed by president
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:07.920]  obama last summer to supposedly reform the banking system and does absolutely
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:12.160]  nothing remotely of the sort it's just very very many pages of a lot of
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:15.920]  legal banter back and forth all of which can have holes poked in it
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:19.120]  really really quickly i mean i can poke a hole in almost any line in that reform
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:23.120]  bill without even having a staff of lawyers um but one of the things that it
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:27.760]  was supposed to do for example is create a
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:31.280]  clearing house or place where where derivatives would trade out in the open
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:34.880]  would be transparent but but all the loopholes related to that said well
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:38.640]  yeah we want them to be transparent and trade on clearing houses but we forgot
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:42.560]  to mention that 96 percent of the clearing activity of the place where
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:45.760]  these transactions are are penn and inks are basically
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:50.240]  transferred um are owned by the top five banks of the united states they're owned
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:54.240]  by jp morgan they're owned by goldman fact no me fact owns one of the largest
[02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:57.440]  clearing houses or portion of that in the world no me stay there we're gonna
[02:50:57.440 --> 02:51:00.480]  come back and continue along that line and ask you the question where's it all
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:02.880]  going is it really possible to get out of

[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:54.400]  uh... they basically you know want to secure their ill-gotten gains they want
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:58.640]  to make us pay off their derivatives uh... i was talking to during the break i
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:00.720]  mean you agree that we're basically by every
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:05.280]  measurement really are in a depression yeah i think we are and by the
[02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:09.680]  measurements that matter to individuals by the measurements that entail
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:13.760]  getting jobs or keeping jobs that enable one to afford
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:17.440]  life uh... by being able to afford whether it's
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:22.880]  health care or food or uh... oil or whatever it might be
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:28.160]  there's there's such a chasm uh... between
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:31.280]  the haves and the have nots and that's not been something that
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:34.800]  hasn't existed in our world before it's just that more recently
[02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:39.680]  and particularly since the economic crisis about it in two thousand eight in
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:43.120]  the fall of two thousand eight it's gotten worse the reason it's gotten
[02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:46.720]  worse is because there is this external veneer
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:52.880]  of recovery there's an external veneer that says well the stock market
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:56.960]  up well the stock market across the stock market across the world
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:01.520]  are up gvp's are increasing all and gvp's by the way are
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:04.800]  generally measured particularly for our country that's a substantial measure it
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:09.200]  has to do with financial services so that the creation of this sort of on paper
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:12.960]  wealth drives how we consider our recovery and other
[02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:16.880]  countries consider their recovery to be but only the mega bankers are making the
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:20.240]  record bonuses the only sector that's showing the big profits
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:23.840]  is the banksters because they're the parasite they're the pair that they're
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:28.720]  they're those services they're they're the purveyor of why markets go up why
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:32.880]  why why profits from corporations go up it's all
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:36.960]  related to what happens with the banking sector i mean it's the
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:40.720]  kernel of all of this worldwide because you know that they all operate
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:46.240]  worldwide but on the flip side are people's real economy on the flip side
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:50.000]  is not being able to make ends meet on the flip side is wages being
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:54.160]  worth less than what they were 35 years ago no matter there haven't been an
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:57.680]  increase for those people you predicted a lot of what happened six years ago in
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:00.000]  your first book because you were an insider
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.640]  where do you see things going because it's clear they're not going to change
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:05.520]  course even if the world's revolting against them
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:09.440]  how do you see it ending i honestly think it's going to get a whole lot worse
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:12.400]  before it gets better when i left the industry and rolled other people's
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:15.840]  money in 2004 and and credit derivatives were a
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:22.000]  tiny spec on the financial speculation screen and cdo's were tiny
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:25.360]  but they were but they were murky and they were they were
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:30.480]  leverageable and they were dangerous and things have gotten more complex and
[02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:36.160]  dangerous since then because um there's been no opposition
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:39.680]  there there've been no regulated regulatory barriers
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:44.080]  to stop the type of financial instruments and financial pillaging that's
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:47.280]  been going on it's only gotten worse but but now there's a pretense that it's
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:50.400]  better the pretense is financial reform stock markets are back up as we just
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:53.280]  mentioned and so forth so i don't think that gets
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:58.000]  better i don't think that changes people's individual economies i think
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.080]  it's going to get a lot worse therefore before it gets better because
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:05.840]  after all of what we saw in 2008 globally after
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:09.840]  banking systems throughout the world um particularly ours we're looking at
[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:13.840]  bankruptcy and and we're looking at potential collapse and an ability to
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:16.960]  fund themselves um they all got better they all got
[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:20.400]  government injections but the individuals people in the various
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:24.960]  countries did not and that will create a more unstable
[02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:29.280]  less equal set of economy is between the banking economy and the people's
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:32.240]  economy um for the foreseeable future so i just
[02:58:32.240 --> 02:58:35.680]  did unfortunately getting worse but i wish i i thought
[02:58:35.680 --> 02:58:38.480]  well i tend to agree with you unfortunately now me friends stay there
[02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:42.160]  we're gonna do five more minutes with the other side

[02:59:00.080 --> 02:59:04.080]  agree perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees but
[02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:06.560]  for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
