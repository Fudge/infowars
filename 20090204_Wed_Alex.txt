[00:45.560 --> 00:53.600]  who is a plaintiff and an expert on the fact that Hillary Clinton is not allowed
[00:53.600 --> 00:57.240]  into the Constitution to be the Secretary of State because she served in
[00:57.240 --> 01:02.320]  the legislative and voted for a pay raise for that position during the same
[01:02.320 --> 01:07.680]  period directly preceding it so we'll spend about 20 30 minutes on that coming
[01:07.680 --> 01:12.480]  up in the next hour then Peter Schiff in two hours joins us Euro Pacific
[01:12.480 --> 01:15.840]  Capital talk about the latest developments in the economy and then Peter
[01:15.840 --> 01:21.360]  Wallison American Enterprise Institute on the banker takeover situation he's

[01:25.720 --> 01:29.760]  different administrations so that is coming up today as well but he's a 30
[01:29.760 --> 01:35.640]  minute guest so is Peter Schiff so is our other guests so we'll have lots of
[01:35.640 --> 01:40.480]  time to cover other news and take your calls other news like this red alert red
[01:40.480 --> 01:47.840]  alert Cheney warns of new attacks Cheney warns of new attacks in an exclusive
[01:47.840 --> 01:53.760]  interview with Politico.com we'll be going over that report also new missing
[01:53.760 --> 02:01.040]  memos have been leaked that I guess were left on White House computers and it's
[02:01.040 --> 02:05.680]  now been leaked out by the Obamanoids I guess and it's just exactly what we said
[02:05.680 --> 02:10.600]  in fact worse where they openly say they're gonna use the military inside
[02:10.600 --> 02:14.040]  the United States and that there's no Constitution no Bill of Rights no Fourth
[02:14.040 --> 02:19.720]  Amendment and these are only one paragraph summaries this was just a
[02:19.720 --> 02:25.560]  memo summary left on a computer system and who knows they probably leaked this
[02:25.560 --> 02:29.680]  on purpose just to flaunt it in our face and the Obamanoids are now saying
[02:29.680 --> 02:34.640]  maybe Cheney's right about executive power and police state because it keeps
[02:34.640 --> 02:38.560]  us safe from al-Qaeda so we'll be getting into this Cheney warns of new
[02:38.560 --> 02:44.680]  attacks report remember Rahm Emanuel said that they're gonna attack gun
[02:44.680 --> 02:48.480]  control onto the anti-terror fight that he knows the American people will go
[02:48.480 --> 02:52.280]  with the anti-terror fight against the Second Amendment so that's how they're
[02:52.280 --> 02:55.600]  gonna phrase all of this out of the Democrats I predicted that before I
[02:55.600 --> 02:58.320]  even knew Rahm Emanuel had said this about a year ago that once the
[02:58.320 --> 03:02.360]  Democrats were in power they would mix gun control in with anti-terrorism and
[03:02.360 --> 03:06.520]  certainly that is of the battle plan what you won't turn your gun in your
[03:06.520 --> 03:13.040]  you you're with the terrorist I mean and I got an email person made a great
[03:13.040 --> 03:16.880]  point if they've got over a million Americans and growing by twenty plus
[03:16.880 --> 03:21.740]  thousand a month twenty five thousand plus a month being added to it and then
[03:21.740 --> 03:26.560]  they have this criminal database of two million if you're a suspected terrorist
[03:26.560 --> 03:29.160]  why aren't they interviewing you aren't they interrogating you why aren't they
[03:29.160 --> 03:33.400]  having a grand jury indict you well because under this new system they
[03:33.400 --> 03:37.280]  just say they think you might be a terrorist and you have no rights that's
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.000]  the whole point about not having a bill of rights or Constitution so they let
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.760]  these people they claim are terrorists a million Americans run around
[03:44.760 --> 03:49.120]  everywhere I mean there's a million Al-Qaeda terrorists in America and you've
[03:49.120 --> 03:52.720]  heard Fox News and BBC there's blonde-haired blue-eyed Al-Qaeda there
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.840]  everywhere look under your bed look in the closet at night look over in your
[03:57.840 --> 04:03.840]  back yard in the garden there may be Al-Qaeda hiding there amongst the
[04:03.840 --> 04:09.560]  turnips so I'm gonna break that down no doubt in my mind they're planning a
[04:09.560 --> 04:14.280]  stage in the inaugural bombing in the next six to seven months just like
[04:14.280 --> 04:19.040]  9-11 and there I mean you think the worship of Bush with a 92% approval
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.760]  writing after they stage 9-11 was I Obama will probably 98% or something
[04:23.760 --> 04:29.940]  except people are now aware of government sponsored terror but the
[04:29.940 --> 04:33.920]  Pentagon is running things for the foreign offshore banks we're going into
[04:33.920 --> 04:38.320]  receivership and they need to stage a terror attack to slap the lid on our
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.520]  freedoms and liberties and complete our journey into absolute complete
[04:42.520 --> 04:51.440]  enslavement despotism bondage so three big guests today your phone calls a ton
[04:51.440 --> 05:01.040]  is and Dick Cheney big-time Dick Cheney says get ready for the terror doctors
[05:01.040 --> 05:04.800]  around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH
[05:04.800 --> 05:08.960]  balanced alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly acidic due
[05:08.960 --> 05:13.680]  to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise pH balance is the foundation of
[05:13.680 --> 05:17.600]  energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease people
[05:17.600 --> 05:21.480]  who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar mental
[05:21.480 --> 05:25.160]  clarity and loss of weight it was intended for human beings to drink
[05:25.160 --> 05:29.560]  alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic the
[05:29.560 --> 05:33.440]  fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat
[05:33.440 --> 05:37.200]  accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't
[05:37.200 --> 05:42.320]  neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body now alcovision

[06:13.960 --> 06:21.080]  platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the AG made a
[06:21.080 --> 06:26.720]  statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing

[12:04.800 --> 12:14.600]  all right Cheney warns of new attacks Cheney warns of new terrorist attacks
[12:14.600 --> 12:19.600]  former vice president Dick Cheney warned that there is a high probability that
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.560]  terrorist will attempt a catastrophic nuclear biological attack in coming
[12:24.560 --> 12:28.520]  years and said he fears the Obama administration's policies will make it
[12:28.520 --> 12:36.840]  more likely the attempt will succeed how many years did I tell you and I saw
[12:36.840 --> 12:40.680]  them setting this up with Patriot Act 2 they said if you don't pass this this
[12:40.680 --> 12:44.520]  will allow terrorists to attack so this is classic terrorism they say give us
[12:44.520 --> 12:47.520]  what we want politically let us overthrow the Bill of Rights the
[12:47.520 --> 12:54.760]  Constitution or the boogeyman we'll come and we'll get you that is the
[12:54.760 --> 12:58.200]  definition of terrorism threatening violence or carrying out violence for
[12:58.200 --> 13:03.520]  a political or economic game and so we're being terrorized and even came out
[13:03.520 --> 13:09.480]  in White House memos Ari Fleischer the previous press secretary before Scott
[13:09.480 --> 13:14.920]  McClellan and then Perino he came out and said yeah the White House is
[13:14.920 --> 13:18.440]  issuing terror alerts for political gain like it was no big deal and the
[13:18.440 --> 13:23.640]  Associated Press reported on it amazing in a press conference in the White House
[13:23.640 --> 13:29.560]  press room on record they issue these to terrorize the public and for political
[13:29.560 --> 13:34.560]  gain to set up this huge police state apparatus that we told you over and over
[13:34.560 --> 13:41.000]  and over again was being designed and set up and built publicly in all the
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.120]  documents just not openly they weren't announcing it on the news but if you
[13:45.120 --> 13:49.240]  publicly went look to the documents it was for the American people for gun
[13:49.240 --> 13:54.480]  owners for marijuana smokers for people that won't hand over their land for
[13:54.480 --> 13:58.120]  people that sue government servants that call themselves officials and
[13:58.120 --> 14:03.960]  authorities and now you hear tens of thousands upon tens of thousands in some
[14:03.960 --> 14:08.080]  cases tens of thousands per state of using the Patriot Act against non-terror
[14:08.080 --> 14:15.760]  related cases arguing with police being caught with marijuana fist fights being
[14:15.760 --> 14:23.880]  charged as terrorists they're swinging the entire system they built around to be
[14:23.880 --> 14:30.440]  pointed right at myself right at you right at all of us and now we have
[14:30.440 --> 14:37.520]  inside the Brady campaign videotape released from inside the bowels of that
[14:37.520 --> 14:43.920]  at a closed meeting a giant auditorium filled with criminal creatures that
[14:43.920 --> 14:48.680]  wish to disarm defaying the American people castrate the American people
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.520]  bound to the American people so they can have our way with us saying we're
[14:52.520 --> 15:00.360]  going to use the threat of terrorism with guns as the pretext to ban it will
[15:00.360 --> 15:10.240]  from executive fiat individuals owning guns and I'm telling you folks I've
[15:10.240 --> 15:13.040]  seen him preparing it talking about wanting to put metal detectors in
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.040]  shopping malls wanting to put metal detectors on street corners make
[15:18.040 --> 15:23.040]  citizens line up and be searched all of this airport security business was
[15:23.040 --> 15:27.120]  training training the American people to take their shoes off to have their
[15:27.120 --> 15:30.400]  toothpaste taken away to have their bottled water taken away to have
[15:30.400 --> 15:35.680]  breastfeeding mothers drink their own milk out of a bottle it's all about
[15:35.680 --> 15:44.280]  humiliation it's all about training you to accept it now it backfired and people
[15:44.280 --> 15:48.560]  flying cut back massively so now when you fly they yes sir thank you it's all
[15:48.560 --> 15:54.080]  this fakeness but they still have you submit and go through all of this they
[15:54.080 --> 15:59.520]  even changed the color of the TSA uniforms to try to confuse people see
[15:59.520 --> 16:07.560]  it's backfiring on them and so now Dick Cheney got up before he left office and
[16:07.560 --> 16:11.120]  he said I think Barack Obama needs to keep all the new presidential executive
[16:11.120 --> 16:14.720]  tools we got where they say the president's even outside the executive
[16:14.720 --> 16:17.880]  and the vice president's outside even the executive outside all branches of
[16:17.880 --> 16:22.760]  government and literally can order torture secret arrest is above the law
[16:22.760 --> 16:30.520]  is the law like God speaking from the white throne of judgment and then
[16:30.520 --> 16:34.520]  Obama what three weeks ago with Stephanophilus on his Sunday morning TV
[16:34.520 --> 16:39.400]  show said yeah I agree with Cheney on that and now they're saying oh we do need
[16:39.400 --> 16:42.880]  to keep the tools of secret arrest and they're just going to change the name of
[16:42.880 --> 16:48.120]  torture to extreme and harsh interrogation there they may close
[16:48.120 --> 16:50.840]  Guantanamo but they're building other ones and saying they'll be right here in
[16:50.840 --> 16:53.800]  the United States then they announced they're building the FEMA camps more of
[16:53.800 --> 16:57.960]  them and trying to pass laws to merge local police under them inside the
[16:57.960 --> 17:01.560]  military compounds it's all there everything exactly as we told you what
[17:01.560 --> 17:06.240]  happened because we were reading their own documents and the documents were all
[17:06.240 --> 17:09.560]  compartmentalized but you could lay each one of them side by side and see a
[17:09.560 --> 17:13.400]  completely clear picture you could differ with my interpretation of it but
[17:13.400 --> 17:20.240]  now in hindsight you can't exactly right precisely right because I probably read
[17:20.240 --> 17:24.960]  50 60 70 books about the Nazis like Heinz Hobel order to the death said 900
[17:24.960 --> 17:29.680]  pages all about how they ran it all their own memos all their own details how
[17:29.680 --> 17:33.080]  they control dissidents while they took over the society how they federalize
[17:33.080 --> 17:39.120]  the police I probably read 15 20 books on Joseph Stalin on linen on the purges
[17:39.120 --> 17:45.760]  on the takeovers from 1917 right through into the 50s I've read many books about
[17:45.760 --> 17:49.000]  communist China including put out by the communist government itself admitting
[17:49.000 --> 17:54.320]  they killed 80 plus million our media says 60 million they say 80 million and
[17:54.320 --> 18:03.080]  they're proud of it the government of China says 80 plus mill one book says 84
[18:03.080 --> 18:09.520]  put out by the government one says 86 I don't know they're proud of that talk
[18:09.520 --> 18:15.400]  about mega death that's mega death 80 plus times mega death one million deaths
[18:15.400 --> 18:24.120]  that's 10 100 person 100,000 person football stadiums 10 100,000 person
[18:24.120 --> 18:31.240]  football stadiums 80 plus times think about that number
[18:32.040 --> 18:37.920]  that is thousands and thousands of sports stadiums with 100,000 people per
[18:37.920 --> 18:44.360]  stadium gone that's the hobby some of you like to bird watch your go out and
[18:44.360 --> 18:48.560]  watch butterflies and bees flap around some of you like to garden some of you
[18:48.560 --> 18:59.080]  like hot rods hop ups some of you like boating some of you like watches some of
[18:59.080 --> 19:04.600]  you like women some of you like men some of you like drinking some of you like
[19:04.600 --> 19:13.640]  sports some of you ride unicycles is your hobby some of you like to box others
[19:13.640 --> 19:21.720]  like to travel the globalists like to kill and that's what they do and they're
[19:21.720 --> 19:25.400]  gonna teach you to love being murdered they're gonna teach you to love have

[36:55.880 --> 37:06.400]  agreement and have handed over all their authority you know Obama said during
[37:06.400 --> 37:14.120]  the campaign he was gonna have this big buy America initiative and then he came
[37:14.120 --> 37:17.560]  out and said oh don't worry that was just rhetoric besides that would violate
[37:17.560 --> 37:21.640]  the world trade organization agreement we signed that's right the government
[37:21.640 --> 37:27.280]  can't even say it has a buy America initiative see there's no sovereignty
[37:27.280 --> 37:33.200]  there they create the world trade organization in 95 and within a few
[37:33.200 --> 37:37.840]  years Congress had passed laws signing over all its authority but it's a fraud
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.880]  just like they passed a law October 3rd last year ceding all authority over the
[37:42.880 --> 37:46.480]  private offshore banks where everything is secret and nothing can be looked at
[37:46.480 --> 37:49.600]  a reviewed and the Federal Reserve one of the board members was in front of
[37:49.600 --> 37:52.720]  Congress last week saying I'm not gonna tell you where the trillions went and
[37:52.720 --> 37:56.760]  congressmen are on record saying where is the money I don't have to tell you
[37:56.760 --> 38:06.200]  punk and that's a fraudulent contract a real contract to stand up in court has
[38:06.200 --> 38:13.520]  to be fair it has to have compensation and it can't be a fraud that's like if
[38:13.520 --> 38:17.280]  somebody can trick your 12-year-old son or daughter at school to sign a contract
[38:17.280 --> 38:21.000]  signing over all their money all their wealth all their intellectual property
[38:21.000 --> 38:28.680]  in their entire life it's a fraudulent contract if you trick an adult into
[38:28.680 --> 38:33.920]  signing a fraudulent contract it can't stand up it's a fraud offshore banks
[38:33.920 --> 38:39.680]  come in here and pay off the Congress to sign over all its authority on trade to
[38:39.680 --> 38:47.360]  an offshore private board and they just do it in any way that's what the Pentagon's
[38:47.360 --> 38:51.940]  there for now Thomas Barnett the big naval war college expert he goes on
[38:51.940 --> 38:56.400]  c-span and admits it that they work for Madison Avenue in the big banks in
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.800]  Wall Street I set him up for the show one time and right before the show he
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.320]  checked out who I was and said no I'm not coming on to John run the show right
[39:04.320 --> 39:10.440]  now so we called Barnett I called him during a break and I said why don't you
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.880]  come on he said I'm not up gonna grace and give validity anything you say I'm
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.960]  not coming on your show and I said your new world order will be defeated we're
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.160]  gonna stop world government he's just like keep on praying keep on hoping and
[39:24.160 --> 39:29.920]  like cackled like a witch and I said I commit before God we're gonna defeat you
[39:29.920 --> 39:34.080]  and he just went hung the phone up I mean you get on the phones with these guys
[39:34.080 --> 39:36.160]  and say we're gonna defeat global government we're gonna defend the
[39:36.160 --> 39:44.760]  Republic and they're just keep on dreaming keep on dreaming we run this
[39:44.760 --> 39:53.840]  thing we're in control to the public it's all the children the terrorists are
[39:53.840 --> 39:59.800]  gonna tackle guns just turn in the firearms just let us have some reasonable
[39:59.800 --> 40:05.000]  gun control for the children so they're safe let us ban whatever we want and
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.360]  to register everyone then by fiat ban anyone we want from owning a gun and
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.160]  ban any guns we want sign over to international bodies and you know dear
[40:14.160 --> 40:20.120]  at the UN to control us through treaty oh we just want to be your friend we're
[40:20.120 --> 40:23.760]  the government
[40:23.760 --> 40:30.920]  just turn the guns in and everything will be fine and then you'll be safe
[40:30.920 --> 40:37.600]  you'll be safe we want to protect you we're the government we're the nice
[40:37.600 --> 40:43.400]  people we're Rahm Emanuel Nancy Pelosi and Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense
[40:43.400 --> 40:50.600]  Gates there you go give me that gun there there now now these nice men in

[40:56.040 --> 41:01.280]  if I did this you are safe safe to be my slave if I choose to allow you to live
[41:01.280 --> 41:12.360]  that is literally the spirit we're dealing with
[41:12.360 --> 41:20.520]  fool fool weak-minded now you will die
[41:23.520 --> 41:26.640]  imagine the Bill of Rights the Constitutional Declaration of
[41:26.640 --> 41:32.960]  Independence that our forebears built to defend against tyranny built to
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.400]  strengthen liberty as a fortress now its walls pull down its battlements crush
[41:38.400 --> 41:43.000]  its doors rammed open but still we're here inside fortress liberty we could
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.880]  still defend the breaches but instead the enemy has its own agents above us
[41:47.880 --> 41:52.760]  leading the citadel stand down it's your friends there's no army at the gates
[41:52.760 --> 41:58.200]  there's no assault there's no new world order don't listen to conspiracy theorist
[41:58.200 --> 42:02.920]  those of you at the walls at the holes at the breaches stand back lay down your
[42:02.920 --> 42:09.320]  swords there's no army there and we say they're catapults their siege engines
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.720]  have knocked holes there are their forces just 10 feet ahead waiting for us
[42:13.720 --> 42:21.120]  to stand aside silence there is no assault listen to the fool who is he
[42:21.120 --> 42:29.560]  to speak but now the enemy is pouring into the
[42:29.560 --> 42:35.320]  breaches the public did stand down not all of them and so they're in the news
[42:35.320 --> 42:41.640]  going yes there's an army here to protect you lay down your arms yes yes yes
[42:41.640 --> 42:46.880]  but wait five minutes ago you said there wasn't an army there it doesn't
[42:46.880 --> 42:52.040]  matter it doesn't matter there was a crisis in the castle there were traders
[42:52.040 --> 42:57.360]  within that tore down the walls and now the army is here to arrest them well
[42:57.360 --> 42:59.840]  wait a minute the traders are talking about the ones that warned us that you
[42:59.840 --> 43:04.360]  were pulling down the walls silence arrest that one as well he is with the
[43:04.360 --> 43:12.040]  enemy that's what they did they said there's no new world order there's no
[43:12.040 --> 43:16.000]  globalism there's no new world or there's no plan for North American Union
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.640]  there's no plan to take your guns there's no plan for foreign banks to take
[43:20.640 --> 43:28.760]  over and then now all over the place they announced oh yes a huge central
[43:28.760 --> 43:32.320]  foreign bank to run everything to save the economy and we'll pay our taxes to
[43:32.320 --> 43:37.120]  the foreign bank and it'll all be secret what they do and the new orders real
[43:37.120 --> 43:45.080]  but it's good all over the New York Times Wall Street Journal times of London
[43:45.080 --> 43:54.360]  Guardian articles with headlines like and now for world government and the new
[43:54.360 --> 44:01.320]  world order to the rescue and their readers are commenting in the comment
[44:01.320 --> 44:04.880]  page is going with thousands of comments will wait you said this didn't
[44:04.880 --> 44:08.000]  exist and I thought those people were coax but now this article says it does
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.440]  exist but I guess maybe they're saying this will fix the economy I want my
[44:13.440 --> 44:18.000]  401k to survive and they're saying only by rolling it into a larger governmental
[44:18.000 --> 44:25.200]  union cannot happen I guess maybe I'm for it then but others are going wait a
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.000]  minute you said this didn't exist all the time it's the banks that are doing all
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.400]  this they're the ones that engineered this what are you talking about then
[44:34.400 --> 44:39.120]  they'll write other sub articles and card comments going you just don't know
[44:39.120 --> 44:43.640]  what's needed you have lack of vision you're small-minded you want to go
[44:43.640 --> 44:52.680]  backwards in time not forwards so now they've imploded the United States like
[44:52.680 --> 44:59.680]  a corpse that's cooling it's still warm but it soon become ice-cold we live
[44:59.680 --> 45:07.320]  inside the corpse it could still be resurrected but but only by you becoming
[45:07.320 --> 45:18.680]  extremely focused informed and animated to see the country covered with ticks and
[45:18.680 --> 45:24.600]  fleas and mites feeding and sucking on it and now the color went out of its pink
[45:24.600 --> 45:30.560]  flesh it turned white and then blue now it begins to rot the lips pull back from
[45:30.560 --> 45:37.880]  the teeth the eyes no longer have any life on them become like dark jelly and
[45:37.880 --> 45:43.800]  the ticks climb over celebrating and preening and blowing their trumpets
[45:43.800 --> 45:48.520]  they've opened the door and army of bigger more disgusting ticks comes
[45:48.520 --> 45:55.800]  toddling in swaying filled with the blood of all the third world nations
[45:55.800 --> 45:59.800]  they've smashed and destroyed and murdered and euthanized and injected with
[45:59.800 --> 46:04.520]  cancer viruses celebrating that we're pulling it down we're pulling the
[46:04.520 --> 46:11.200]  republic down all we did in the Soviet Union all the tens of millions murdered
[46:11.200 --> 46:18.480]  soon will truly stop on blood we'll die on man flesh tonight

[46:27.400 --> 46:32.200]  soon you will pull their children away from them as they beg and plead what
[46:32.200 --> 46:38.680]  say you throngs of vampires of soulless cretins of satan what say you to our
[46:38.680 --> 46:47.480]  great victory over the republic what say you and they cheer yes yes soon we will
[46:47.480 --> 46:54.080]  stage the final terror attacks soon we will completely smash the republic and
[46:54.080 --> 47:00.320]  soon they will beg and plead and you your dark spirits will be able to feed all
[47:00.320 --> 47:05.960]  the ancient spirits of evil that inhabit this strong this horde these legions of
[47:05.960 --> 47:11.840]  darkness will be able to stop on the terror and pain of the American people
[47:11.840 --> 47:17.720]  the ancient enemy of the new world order will soon begin our control and the mass
[47:17.720 --> 47:22.880]  murder of these enemies will be greater than our sopping our feeding in Russia
[47:22.880 --> 47:28.400]  and China and Germany and Africa and Latin America soon we will kill with
[47:28.400 --> 47:41.880]  wanton of ending soon we will rebel in the blood I see the enemy I can stare
[47:41.880 --> 47:46.640]  right past the new world orders veils I know their spirit and what you just saw
[47:46.640 --> 47:52.600]  was nothing more than a mirror into the heart of darkness into what you face
[47:52.600 --> 48:01.600]  your impoverishment is certain your enslavement is near your death for many
[48:01.600 --> 48:11.080]  of you is a guaranteed a guarantor unless you rise in every way known to you
[48:11.080 --> 48:16.240]  unless you let the spirit of the living God inhabit you and unless you say a
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.320]  prayer that you commit yourself to whatever danger you commit yourself
[48:20.320 --> 48:26.560]  into the God of life's hands and ask the great Creator to empower and to
[48:26.560 --> 48:31.680]  breathe life into your limbs and into your soul and into your mind and
[48:31.680 --> 48:37.160]  commit yourself to the fight against darkness that is the only escape and it
[48:37.160 --> 48:45.600]  may not be a physical escape but it is a guaranteed spiritual escape and an
[48:45.600 --> 48:52.960]  eternal escape the devil's greatest trick was to teach the public that he
[48:52.960 --> 48:57.120]  didn't exist and that's what they've done even if you're an atheist notice that
[48:57.120 --> 49:01.280]  they've taught you there's no good and evil they wrote books like Beyond Good
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.520]  and Evil they teach you there's no moral compass so you will stand down so you are
[49:05.520 --> 49:09.000]  rudderless but they have their moral compass death and destruction and
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.120]  eternal domination the high priest of power always pressing on the nerve of
[49:13.120 --> 49:17.400]  power always tearing apart the innocent the begging the pleading it's not about
[49:17.400 --> 49:21.720]  state control it's not about even them running things it's about attacking
[49:21.720 --> 49:26.880]  goodness everything they build is the savage goodness and honor and beauty
[49:26.880 --> 49:36.120]  they hate it the darkness runs from the light and they have been building
[49:36.120 --> 49:40.520]  towards their great work sucking down the United States using its remnants as
[49:40.520 --> 49:47.600]  fodder as coal in their blast furnace to roll forward their great siege engines
[49:47.600 --> 49:53.640]  of destruction their war mocks their battering rams to tear down the few
[49:53.640 --> 49:59.920]  remaining countries in the world that have not fallen to the ultimate evil if

[50:23.760 --> 50:28.240]  system they have built a degenerate system where they are needed why are
[50:28.240 --> 50:33.040]  they destroying the economy now to bring in more domestication more control to
[50:33.040 --> 50:42.120]  tie down the people so they can feed on us they are spiritual vampires they are
[50:42.120 --> 50:50.080]  soulless black holes who only exist to tear down innocence they are your
[50:50.080 --> 50:56.120]  mortal enemy and they are here among us and their numbers swell but our numbers

[55:19.200 --> 55:25.400]  Cheney warns of new attacks terrorizing the public in an interview with
[55:25.400 --> 55:29.240]  political Cheney unneillingly defended the Bush administration support for the
[55:29.240 --> 55:35.840]  Guantanamo Bay prison and coercive interrogation terrorist suspects as he
[55:35.840 --> 55:41.640]  asserted the president Obama will either backtrack on his stated intentions to end

[55:46.040 --> 55:51.120]  secret arrest or the risk in ways more severe than most Americans and he charged
[55:51.120 --> 55:55.840]  many members of Obama's own team understand when we get people who are
[55:55.840 --> 55:59.880]  more concerned about reading the rights to an al-qaeda terrorist you mean a pot

[56:12.400 --> 56:18.360]  protecting the country security is a tough mean dirty nasty business he said
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.440]  you got to work on the dark side remember that quote from Cheney you got to
[56:22.440 --> 56:27.840]  work on the dark side sometimes these are evil people he takes one of no one
[56:27.840 --> 56:33.040]  doesn't it and we're not going to win this fight by turning the other cheek
[56:33.040 --> 56:38.120]  citing intelligence reports Cheney said at least 61 of the inmates who were
[56:38.120 --> 56:42.200]  released from Guantanamo during the Bush administration that's about 11 to 12%
[56:42.200 --> 56:46.200]  have gone back into the business of being terrorists just popping up on CIA
[56:46.200 --> 56:50.000]  front websites that was the whole point it took innocent people there and heard
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.560]  them in operatives the 200 or so inmates still there he claimed I even said on
[56:54.560 --> 56:57.080]  there they were gonna have them popping up on TV and they did I just got the
[56:57.080 --> 57:02.240]  people figured out man oh it's sick people look right into their minds the
[57:02.240 --> 57:08.440]  200 or so inmates still there he claimed are the hardcore whose recidivism rate
[57:08.440 --> 57:12.000]  would be much higher lawyers for Guantanamo detainees have strongly
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.720]  disputed the recidivism figures serving the Pentagon data have inconsistencies
[57:17.720 --> 57:23.560]  and omissions how do you know they're guilty if they haven't been tried I mean
[57:23.560 --> 57:29.280]  this is ridiculous and then the author of bone crusher
[57:29.280 --> 57:33.640]  a jawbreaker we had him on the CIA section chief over Afghanistan admitted
[57:33.640 --> 57:36.800]  that they would just go grab innocent 14-year-old kids and put them in there
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.720]  Cheney called Guantanamo a first-class program and a necessary facility that
[57:41.720 --> 57:45.040]  it's operated legally and with better food and treatment in the jails and
[57:45.040 --> 57:49.760]  inmates native countries but he said he worried that instead of sitting down and
[57:49.760 --> 57:53.400]  carefully evaluating the policies Obama officials are unwisely following campaign
[57:53.400 --> 57:57.080]  rhetoric and preparing to release terrorism suspects or afford the legal
[57:57.080 --> 58:01.720]  protection set what is this do this is Cheney see oh this is play acting they've
[58:01.720 --> 58:04.240]  left all the key globalist in they brought in the Clinton people they've
[58:04.240 --> 58:07.720]  left gates all these other neocons in all these neocons like max boot under
[58:07.720 --> 58:16.080]  saying we love Obama now all of this is going on and happening and then Cheney
[58:16.080 --> 58:19.640]  comes out and says Obama isn't getting tough on terrorists and that makes his
[58:19.640 --> 58:23.200]  stance was really the same one look good the liberals sets of the left and right
[58:23.200 --> 58:26.680]  paradigm works they give each other political cover this will energize
[58:26.680 --> 58:31.360]  Obama's base all right I'm gonna get more into this but for 30 minutes we're
[58:31.360 --> 58:35.440]  gonna have a guest on going in on the horn getting into all the illegalities

[1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:12.360]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:29.240]  Alex Jones Eugene Nevolik is our guest for the next 20 minutes or so he's a
[1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:34.560]  Gary T. Swartz professor of law UCLA law school and we've heard about Hillary
[1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:37.600]  Clinton being in the Senate voting for a pay raise for the executive under the
[1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:41.000]  Constitution and I supposed to be able to serve if in the term right before
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.720]  that you vote yourself a pay raise in the executive that's basically how it
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:48.240]  boils down and there's other things like if you're an executive in government
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:52.200]  you're not supposed to go overseas and get involved in policy with private
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:55.160]  groups unauthorized by the State Department or whatever and they do that
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:57.680]  with the Bilderberg group and other things so I wanted to talk to him about
[1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:02.400]  how they get away with not following this I saw him cited in the judicial watch
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:07.320]  case that they filed against Hillary Clinton judicial watch files lawsuit
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:10.440]  challenging Hillary Clinton appointment on behalf of State Department Foreign
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:15.960]  Service officer so that's why we have Eugene Volek on with us today UCL a law
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:22.200]  professor sir thanks for coming on very much my pleasure what's really going on
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:26.360]  here how does it Hillary get away with us well so the Constitution says that
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:30.400]  no senator shall during the time for which he was elected be appointed to
[1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:36.920]  any civil office such as for example the cabinet which have been created or the
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:41.960]  emoluments were of shall have been increased during such time so what
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:47.680]  happened was that Congress increased the salary for Secretary of State during
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:54.640]  the time that that that essentially during senator Clinton's latest term but
[1:01:54.640 --> 1:02:00.600]  then it decreased the salary for that very same office when it looked like
[1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:04.040]  senator Clinton was being appointed so the question is whether that
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:08.000]  constant situation where the emoluments of the office shall have been increased
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:11.080]  during such time because there are one thing increased even though later
[1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:15.520]  decreased or whether that doesn't constitute emoluments having been
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:21.120]  increased because on balance after the plus and the minus the emoluments are
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:24.520]  precisely the same as at the start of her term that's the constitutional
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:28.360]  question so it's a letter of the law versus spirit of the law question well
[1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:32.960]  it's not really clear what the spirit of the law is you might say the spirit of
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:39.200]  the law is to avoid any possible incentive for legislators to increase
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:43.480]  salaries well I'm not a constitutional well now no constitutional law scholar
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:46.960]  yourself but it seems this is the supreme law of the land it needs to be
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:51.560]  honored so don't you want to go on the more conservative side and say that she
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:55.280]  shouldn't be able to do this well remember the Constitution doesn't just
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:59.680]  have this provision the Constitution also has an article to another pretty
[1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:02.480]  important provision which is the presidential of the power to appoint
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:08.080]  officers so the Constitution quite deliberately creates a a scheme during
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:12.200]  each the president can choose those people whom he wants to serve and
[1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:16.080]  implement his policy so on the one hand it gives good president this power on
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:20.520]  the other hand it limits the power so it's not clear to me so that would that
[1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:25.800]  the limitation should somehow be read extra certively as opposed to the the
[1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:28.960]  grant of power being read extra certably I think we should read both of them
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:34.680]  reasonably and the question is whether shall have been increased it should be
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:39.000]  interpreted as referring to any increase during that term or just an
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.280]  aggregate increase so it's another separation of powers issue where they
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:48.160]  set it up perfectly to really create gridlock no no I don't think that's right
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:54.760]  they the framers deliberately gave the executive very broad authority to
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:04:02.160]  select whomever he pleases as as his officers as his cabinet members subject
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:09.160]  of course to confirmation by the Senate but they impose this limitation that in
[1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:12.880]  some measure limits that I don't think that this fosters gridlock it it does
[1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:17.520]  affect the the kind of salaries that can be paid in the way they can be
[1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:21.320]  increased I will say if you do care about the spirit of the law it's not
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:25.600]  clear to me that the spirit of the provision has been violated here here
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:31.840]  either that it's not like senator Clinton is getting any extra money in her
[1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:36.480]  pocket because of the raise in fact the whole point of the diminution of the
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:39.960]  salary which was about to be appointed to make sure she doesn't get any extra
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:43.720]  money what about the letter of the law will come back and talk about that on
[1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:47.320]  the other side and then I want to pick your brand about a few other
[1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:54.760]  constitutional issues as well we appreciate our guest joining us he is a
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:05:00.240]  UCLA law school professor we'll be right back
[1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:04.640]  phase one of the insiders plan for a one-world government has been initiated
[1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:08.200]  with the recent bailout international bankers and power brokers have
[1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:12.400]  engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to
[1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:16.280]  act as savior but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis
[1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:20.560]  will be on a scale never before seen in modern times shortages and empty shelves
[1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:24.360]  will spread fear and panic across the land the insiders have discovered that
[1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:28.840]  they must control two things to cease total power phase one is a one-world
[1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:32.600]  currency which we are currently being prepared to accept phase two of their

[1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:15.840]  we're talking a law professor UCLA law school Eugene Bollack about this
[1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:22.520]  controversy about Hillary Clinton raising the executive branch cabinet pay
[1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:33.520]  and then changing it back I mean lawyers have to give some opinion on this
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:39.360]  though I mean it looks to fit me down the middle what is your opinion sir well
[1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:45.480]  I do think it's a pretty close case I think that precedent in this case
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:48.560]  legislative rather than judicial precedent cuts in favor of the
[1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:55.960]  constitutionality of this this is these kinds of fixes to the to the
[1:08:55.960 --> 1:09:00.000]  monuments problem have been around for several decades that from the start of
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.520]  the 20th century they've been not uncommon since about 1970 they actually
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:10.240]  called the sacks be fixed after the name of a of a particular pointy for whom
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:14.200]  such a statute was enacted what is the name of a Democrat or Democratic and
[1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:17.440]  Republican administrations have to take an advantage of them there's one
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:22.200]  exception the Reagan administration one reason that that that that uh...
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:26.200]  judge bork was actually a judge bork justice kennedy is on the court now is
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:30.760]  that senator hatch who had been considered as an option by the uh...
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:35.120]  by the Reagan administration after judge bork was rejected by the senate
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:40.120]  senator hatch the Reagan administration concluded was disqualified and the
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:43.560]  Reagan administration's view was that this kind of that fix that lowering the
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:47.640]  salary for the office for the remainder of the term uh... was not an adequate
[1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:50.200]  fix so there has been some dissent from this view from the Reagan
[1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:53.240]  administration but otherwise both republicans and democrats have
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:58.720]  generally taken the view that uh... so long as when the person enters the
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:02.920]  office the salary is no more than what it was with the start of the senator's
[1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:06.680]  term of that constitutionally permissible and i think that president
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:08.760]  should have some weight
[1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:12.720]  okay but you say this change in the last hundred years what was the previous
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:17.720]  precedent because you don't you want to go back to the well that's what i think
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:22.320]  that's right but i'm not aware of any of any real past uh... president with
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:26.200]  regard to that it's not like somebody tried that in seventeen ninety five and
[1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:30.000]  everybody said no no no of course that's what i'm saying if there isn't
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:34.200]  uh... this question coming up previously that looks like they didn't violate it
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:36.800]  or questionably uh... violated
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:39.520]  previously so this is something newer
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:42.520]  uh... i think that leans towards it uh...
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:46.040]  no big constitutional we have we have the tax that is pretty uh... that is
[1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:47.280]  pretty ambiguous
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:51.200]  uh... and so if there was some precedent at the time of the framing that said
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:54.560]  the ambiguity needs to be resolved this one particular way
[1:10:54.560 --> 1:10:57.680]  then i agree that would be pretty persuasive but the thing is there was no
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:01.560]  such discussion around uh... the time of the fray and why nobody had raised the
[1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:05.040]  issue that they're on the time of the framing so the consequence uh... we
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:08.600]  don't have framing error precedent yet that we have precedent
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:12.480]  no no we don't uh... it's uh... i mean if you could point me to something for
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:14.680]  all i don't know if there is something that nobody has identified with you
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:19.000]  that was a disagree with you uh... i just
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.040]  what i'm trying to say here is
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:22.200]  if
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:26.520]  if they didn't have this question raise until ninety to a hundred years ago
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:27.960]  that it sounds like
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:31.600]  they just would do what reagan did and if there was any question
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:33.920]  then they would do with it with hatch
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:37.960]  and disqualify them from
[1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:41.800]  you know from that position in the legislative in the executive or in the
[1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:43.000]  judiciary
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:47.680]  no it's just that the this option uh... uh... had wasn't discussed it wasn't
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:49.440]  there was discussed and rejected
[1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:52.440]  uh... it's just that it wasn't discussed i actually don't know what the pattern
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:55.960]  of the error was it may be that it was fairly uncommon for salaries to be
[1:11:55.960 --> 1:11:58.840]  raised or for senators to be appointed to those kinds of positions
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:11:59.920]  hard to tell
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:03.880]  uh... but in any event there isn't the kind of precedent uh... that i think
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:08.280]  would show some deliberate judgment as to well uh... one interpretation or
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:11.720]  another i should say i thought that it was pretty close i do think it's pretty
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:15.800]  close on the tax but i actually lean in favor of thinking that there is no
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:17.880]  constitutional problem even under the tax
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:20.280]  imagine that you're considering a new job
[1:12:20.280 --> 1:12:22.480]  and you're kind of wondering whether
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:25.240]  whether there's been an increase in the salary so you ask well
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:28.040]  has the salary been increased during the past year
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:31.440]  and somebody says well you know it went up by ten thousand bucks but then it was
[1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:33.040]  cut by the same ten thousand bucks
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:34.760]  would you say yes the
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:37.440]  uh... salary has been increased during the past year
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:40.720]  i think you probably wouldn't i think you probably say well what i care about
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:43.760]  is the net what i care about is the result the result is being paid the
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:46.320]  same as it was a year ago so it hasn't been increased
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:48.080]  i understand the blip up and down
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:50.400]  okay so that brings a lot of clarity
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:54.040]  to this why do you think judicial watch that is uh... going after
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:55.760]  uh... hillary for this
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:12:56.880]  well i
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:00.000]  uh... that's my view but i'm but i think uh...
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.200]  thoughtful reasonable people can take an opposite view they obviously feel that
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:04.000]  there is a
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.600]  uh... that this is impermissible and they're willing to litigate it and
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:10.160]  it'll be interesting to interesting to see what happens
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:12.360]  i'm gonna get them on to find out what they think about it
[1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:15.680]  uh... shifting years have you heard about job the new
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:18.720]  missing memos they found in white house computers
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:20.280]  giving more clarity
[1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:24.680]  uh... to john you saying the president was basically god and his own separate
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:26.800]  branch of government even outside the executive
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:31.120]  uh... fourth amendment doesn't apply to military operations abroad or the u.s
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:34.960]  the memo titled re authority for use of military force to combat terrorist
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:35.760]  activities
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:38.160]  within the united states concludes the fourth amendment
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:40.320]  protections against warrantless search and seizure
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:43.680]  don't apply to military operations even within the operations
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:45.640]  take place on u.s. soil
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:46.560]  what do you think of that
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:50.720]  uh... you know i haven't read the memo uh... but uh... there's a pretty uh...
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:54.000]  uh... long-standing unresolved question about the extent to which the fourth
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.160]  amendment applies that uh... national security matters
[1:13:57.160 --> 1:14:01.120]  uh... the court has made clear the fourth amendment does not apply to search it
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:05.840]  searches outside of the u.s. involving uh... people who are not u.s. citizens
[1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:07.800]  that's a case called the prodigal equities
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:12.560]  so uh... yes military operations but also non-military ones outside of the u.s.
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:16.720]  but so we have federal we have federal laws like posse commentatus
[1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:20.200]  saying the military shouldn't even be involved in domestic operations of law
[1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:21.720]  enforcement period
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:26.120]  so that right there box it so there's a case called uh... which often called
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:29.520]  key although it's actually u.s. v i think u.s. district court
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:31.600]  which has the question whether
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:35.840]  uh... uh... fourth amendment applies at all to national security
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:37.920]  surveillance within the u.s.
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:40.680]  uh... and the court has left that unresolved
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:44.080]  uh... this is in the in the nineteen seventies uh... it's not clear whether
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:47.480]  this is true my understanding i'm not a historian of this uh... my
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:50.680]  understanding is that past american practice has been that uh...
[1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:53.640]  uh... that national security surveillance was done routinely without
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:57.040]  any uh... sense of a constitutional problem really i don't know why they
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:01.680]  saying it was illegal than they had the retroactively pass along congress
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:05.280]  uh... i'm sorry uh... you're talking about that you're talking about the
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:10.040]  uh... the the telephone surveillance question yes uh... uh... uh... i
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:11.320]  i think uh...
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:14.000]  uh... the surveillance that was going on
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:17.920]  may very well have been a violation of a pre-existing federal statute
[1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:22.080]  i don't think the surveillance of the telephone calls overseas uh...
[1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:25.640]  uh... overseas are happy to have overseas with the fourth amendment
[1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:27.480]  violation may have been a statutory one
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:29.840]  do you agree with the last two supreme court rulings
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:31.760]  uh... on the the uh...
[1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:35.160]  really slashing the fourth amendment to bits i mean why do we even have it then
[1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:38.800]  uh... well i'm sorry uh... that that that kind of assumed the conclusion right
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:42.880]  the fourth amendment says there are no uh... that uh... uh... uh... the
[1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:46.080]  government may not engage in unreasonable searches and seizures
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:49.560]  it also says that warrants shall be issued on probable cause
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:50.480]  uh... but
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:54.480]  well for a reason that i'm reasonable searches and seizures so the real
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:57.440]  question is what's reasonable what's not unfortunately the fourth amendment
[1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:58.440]  tell us that
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:15:59.560]  uh... yet
[1:15:59.560 --> 1:16:02.120]  wait a minute just a second tell us exclusionary rule is where you're
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:06.200]  advising uh... general hayden when he was at the u.s.a.
[1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.960]  because he got up in front of law scholars and they were tearing him up
[1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:10.480]  and he on c span
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:12.160]  and he said that
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:14.240]  no it doesn't need probable cause
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:16.040]  it only needs to be reasonable
[1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:19.280]  and you know that's that that's chopping the amendment up
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:22.720]  and then uh... you know as thomas jefferson said
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:25.600]  uh... you know trying to squeeze a meaning in there that isn't there i mean
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:28.720]  i mean i think that the body of evidence and precedent
[1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:30.480]  is is saying you've got a
[1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:32.880]  uh... it you know it's got to be reasonable you got a all through
[1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:35.640]  affirmation you've got a probable cause you know it
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:39.280]  what so so if you want to talk president specially from the framing era
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:40.640]  uh... we don't know
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:44.520]  the fact is that uh... they do uh... the scope of searches by the federal
[1:16:44.520 --> 1:16:47.080]  government particular during the federal era was pretty narrow
[1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:50.280]  but one area where they did do searches was searches of
[1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:54.080]  uh... uh... material being imported into the united states
[1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:57.760]  uh... usually to enforce uh... customs duties and other prohibitions of
[1:16:57.760 --> 1:16:59.960]  contraband
[1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:01.280]  that's under admiralty
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:04.840]  well admiral the uh... it's not actually i think admiralty law technically
[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:08.240]  but the federal power to search things coming into the u.s. is part of federal
[1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:12.880]  power justice federal power it would be uh... uh... uh... uh... record
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:15.320]  conversations that are coming into the u.s.
[1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:18.280]  uh... so in any event there's certainly precedent for the notion
[1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:21.160]  in fact ample precedent that reasonableness doesn't always require
[1:17:21.160 --> 1:17:22.160]  probable cause
[1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:24.720]  there's also precedent for the notion that sometimes it requires probable cause
[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:26.280]  i don't think these questions are at all
[1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:29.120]  uh... are at all straightforward nor do i say that government should always win
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:30.760]  in these cases not by any means
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:33.880]  but i do think we have to recognize the fourth amendment says there should be no
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:35.640]  unreasonable searches and seizures
[1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:39.320]  and in a separate closet says no warrants chill issue but upon probable
[1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:43.040]  cause it doesn't say there should be no searches without probable cause it
[1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:45.160]  doesn't say there should be no searches without a warrant
[1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:48.160]  so the court has had to struggle with trying to figure out what this means
[1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:51.720]  in light of both the tax and historical practice that says sometimes a
[1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:55.400]  warrant is required sometimes probable cause is required sometimes it's not
[1:17:55.400 --> 1:17:57.320]  well i mean who can say that
[1:17:57.320 --> 1:17:59.720]  there aren't cameras in school bathrooms and
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:02.520]  there aren't face-scanning cameras going up everywhere and
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:05.360]  the police aren't wearing black uniforms and ski mask up
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:08.200]  i mean this country's turning into a police state and people can
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:11.280]  kind of put perfume on it all day but it really is uh...
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:13.040]  a monstrosity
[1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:15.880]  well you know it's very hard to talk about general
[1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:19.240]  general matters like there's an example the patriot act
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:23.120]  uh... is now being used against people charging a mysterious to argue with
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:24.080]  flight attendants
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:27.160]  it's now being used in thousands of marijuana cases as i'm sure you know
[1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:30.600]  professor the patriot act is a whole bunch of different provisions some of
[1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:33.480]  them having to do something that's a straight forward as it was when you
[1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:35.880]  get a warrant
[1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:39.280]  some provisions that have to have to do with that with terrorism some provisions
[1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:41.600]  are are more broad law enforcement
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:47.720]  the patriot act it's funny how everything in the past several years has been
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:51.640]  blamed on the patriot act sort of that the patriot act has become a stand-in for
[1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:55.240]  the entirety of government law enforcement and anti-terrorism policy
[1:18:55.240 --> 1:18:57.480]  patriotic is a bunch of different provisions if you want to talk about
[1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:00.200]  particular ones i'm happy to criticize them
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:02.120]  section 802
[1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:04.280]  changing the definition broadening it
[1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:07.160]  uh... to any action in dangerous human life it's a violation of any federal
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:08.360]  state law
[1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:11.320]  i'm sure you know they're they're they're using it to get around people's
[1:19:11.320 --> 1:19:12.280]  rights
[1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:15.720]  uh... all over the uh... all of the united states local governments are
[1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:18.880]  they're you they're they're charging people with terrorism for for spelling
[1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:20.440]  buddy mary on their well
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:24.120]  well hold on a moment section 802 definition of domestic terrorism case
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:26.040]  it changes a particular
[1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:29.440]  uh... provision of uh... of the federal section two-third three-one
[1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:32.960]  uh... statute to include acts dangerous to human life that are violation of
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:34.000]  criminal laws
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:35.200]  and that or uh...
[1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:38.160]  uh... that appeared uh... and that appeared to be intended to
[1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:41.000]  intimidate a course of civilian population i could keep reading
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.800]  uh... if you can point me to a particular persecution where that's being
[1:19:43.800 --> 1:19:46.080]  used in order to uh...
[1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:49.440]  go after things that are not dangerous to human life and they're not intended to
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:50.240]  coerce the
[1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:53.880]  uh... civilian population or influence the policy of government i'd be happy
[1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:58.000]  uh... to look at that and criticize that stay there stay there we will come

[1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:12.920]  Eugene Volick UCLA law schools are guessed this is a short segment we should
[1:24:12.920 --> 1:24:18.280]  buck sir we just googled it in-flight confrontations can lead to charges to
[1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:23.640]  find his terrorism la times January 20th I mean you knew section 802 of the
[1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:28.200]  Patriot Act I know you've seen these in the obviously researching all this and
[1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:32.320]  it goes into all the names and people you know you're not even cussing in a
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:37.440]  flight attendant spilling a bloody Mary marijuana cases I mean I've got to pull
[1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:42.000]  up headlines with headlines like state of South Carolina charges thousands
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.840]  under Patriot Act as terrorists and I mean I mean you know about that I mean I
[1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:50.040]  can read the names if you want right now but I mean you've got to know about
[1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:54.520]  that I did I do know there's been a lot of coverage but thanks to the
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:57.960]  commercial break I actually looked up the case which I think you're referring
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:25:04.880]  to it to the LA Times story about a Tamara Joe Freeman it turns out she was
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:11.200]  not prosecuted under section 802 of the act she pled guilty to violating a
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:17.440]  pre-existing statute 42 49 USC section 46504 which is interference with flight
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:20.320]  crew members in attendance which sounds like exactly the sort of thing that was
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:24.920]  an issue it's not a terrorism statute it is true the Patriot Act touched that
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:30.680]  statute in one very narrow way what the Patriot Act did was it in addition to
[1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:36.480]  it I'm sorry changed it to say not just interference but also attempt to
[1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:40.880]  interfere and conspiracy to interfere constitutes violation not of the
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:44.240]  why are they holding her for three months without a lawyer that I mean I guess the
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:48.960]  LA Times is wrong man well yes in fact actually I was reading some comments by
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:54.400]  a lawyer whom I know who was evaluating that that says that the LA Times I got
[1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:57.800]  it quite badly wrong of that but certainly if you want you can find the
[1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:01.000]  the plea agreement in which she describes what's going on and what's
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:05.720]  described is that she as I said it wasn't a section 802 per of the Patriot Act
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:10.360]  but about section one terrorism convection it was interference with flight
[1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:14.280]  attendants well they did you said the Patriot Act touched it but what about so
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:18.080]  it touched it in order to say that not just interfere with the flight attendant
[1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:21.560]  but attempting to interfere and conspiring to interfere is also a crime
[1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:25.080]  that's a standard legal principle that if a crime is something that crimes those
[1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:29.320]  attempting conspiring to do it what about section 213 okay what about it I
[1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:35.920]  mean go through some of the sections you don't okay well I'm sorry so you called
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:38.560]  me by the emoluments blog I'm happy to talk about this too but give me a
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:44.080]  moment to find this so section 213 is authority for delaying notice of the
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:49.440]  execution of a warrant that that generally speaking when a warrant is
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:52.800]  executed somebody knocks on your door and says we're executing this warrant
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:56.560]  please step aside we're going to search your your property is that all with the
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:59.840]  rule absolutely not let's say for example they execute a warrant in order to
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:05.080]  put a wiretap on setting completely a site terrorism in a drug investigation or
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:08.520]  a mafia investigation naturally they don't inform the people who are being
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:13.320]  surveilled that the warrant has been has been executed so what we're talking
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:20.680]  about here is we're talking about a a slight extension of a pretty longstanding
[1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:26.080]  legal principle are you are you are you for sneak and peek for a for sneak and
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:31.520]  peek warrants the answer is sometimes yes and sometimes no that's the law has
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:37.160]  never said you have to disclose every time you serve a warrant because then
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:40.800]  you can't investigate the mafia sir I understand that under the mafia rules
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:46.000]  that a lot of things expanded but but previously I mean is the state not
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:49.760]  getting more power and exercising more power than it had previously are you
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:55.040]  going to go the answer is that it's complicated so so for example let's
[1:27:55.040 --> 1:27:57.920]  talk about freedom of speech which is actually the area I mostly oh I was
[1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:01.840]  being so in a very broad restriction interesting you say free speech does
[1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:05.280]  that's what many people talk about with regard to campuses for example people
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:09.280]  go to our campus speech codes which I strongly oppose and I have forcefully
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:14.480]  argued against up until around 1960 or so it was generally clear that that
[1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:17.920]  universities had almost unlimited power to impose whatever speech codes they
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:22.520]  liked in fact and in fact it was basically in the 60s and 70s on that
[1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:25.720]  we've gotten more protection for free research than pretty much we are has
[1:28:25.720 --> 1:28:30.640]  been done on universities and as you know New York just lost hundreds of
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:35.160]  lawsuits on their free speech zones no no I agree and I as I said I'm a
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:38.600]  big believer in campus free speech but if you're saying we're somehow less
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:42.600]  freer now than before the fact is up until 1960 or so it would have been more
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:46.000]  or less an open and shut case that a university entitled so restrict whatever
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.400]  it's always bad but I think we're getting better sure I mean things are
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:55.200]  changing it can't be denied I mean 20,000 combat troops for riot control in
[1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:59.400]  the army or college says they're getting ready to engage the American people I
[1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:03.800]  mean this is tyranny and and I don't think there's any way to lawyer around it
[1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:07.200]  but I'm glad you you do it to support more free speech I mean are you
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:13.560]  concerned about Posse Comitatus and being eroded or you know my main areas
[1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:17.480]  free speech I'm not certainly an expert in Posse Comitatus Act I think that
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:21.320]  generally speaking use of military is for different domestic purposes a bad
[1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:26.520]  idea sometimes I think for example in a riot context use of the National Guard
[1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:30.280]  and similar military is perfectly sensible all right professor we
[1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:35.400]  appreciate you spending time with us so people can find you at the UCLA law

[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:54.920]  also want to start getting into the big stack of news I haven't gotten to yet Peter
[1:33:54.920 --> 1:34:01.200]  Schiff is gonna be joining us coming up in about 26 minutes from now
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:13.400]  from now say something about that last guest we had on you know I've seen most
[1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:16.280]  of the Supreme Court in USA today articles and others say that they're
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:21.720]  now following international law they're now following you in criminal court
[1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:26.080]  rulings European Union court rulings and saying that's their ultimate
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:30.320]  authority not the Constitution Bill of Rights and if you get classical
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:33.200]  constitutional scholars on they would disagree with that guy that's what a
[1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:37.920]  lawyer does he's it all sounds reasonable it all sounds nice but it's all
[1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:43.280]  180 degrees away from the history of this country in the way those laws the
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:49.680]  Bill of Rights Constitution were interpreted and liberty is being
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:54.440]  eroded I mean the public schools are little prisons the Fourth Amendment is
[1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:59.040]  waived routinely they are introducing bills to outright eviscerate the second
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:04.760]  amendment no one could deny that all this is happening but that's how they
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:09.240]  always do it when they claim though I'm pro-liberty but we can do sneak and
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:13.240]  peek warrants well I've had many constitutional law scholars on who
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:17.600]  completely agree I disagree with that so remember because that guy was saying
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:22.160]  you know he agreed with us to read with that doesn't mean that that is the case
[1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:25.640]  he's saying it's his opinion and you know what we do we see a judicial watch
[1:35:25.640 --> 1:35:30.600]  article and they you know they quote scores of lawyers and findings and
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:34.960]  court cases we just picked one out of the bunch and got him on we could have
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:39.360]  countless others on with other opinions but it shows you what they're doing
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:43.040]  they're in there just just watering everything down with oh no it's not
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:47.880]  probable cause it's not no no it's reasonable and the government says it's
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:51.560]  reasonable and then all these quotes about how all we're gonna use the
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:54.480]  military in America and no fourth amendments needed and you know I could
[1:35:54.480 --> 1:35:58.560]  have brought up to him okay there's Marines out at DWI checkpoints now how
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:04.560]  is that national security he said well I want to see the case you know and he
[1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:07.520]  said well the Patriot Act is not involved in this case with this woman on a
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:11.280]  plane except in one area they held her for three months without charges folks
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:15.400]  they held her for three months didn't let us see a lawyer and I can go over these
[1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:22.480]  cases over and over again and there was the case of a toy shop in St. Helena
[1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:31.680]  Oregon puffer belly toys we had her on and she'd bought a magic cube and knock
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:35.240]  off of the Rubik's Cube they're sold in stores nationwide they showed up on her
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:38.720]  homeland securing the Patriot Act and told her she couldn't tell anybody they
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:42.680]  were there or she'd be arrested under the Patriot Act because they invoked the
[1:36:42.680 --> 1:36:48.720]  sneak and peek provision 213 claiming that that there was a gag order and they
[1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:53.760]  tried to tell borders books and libraries they had to give them all their
[1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:57.120]  list of what people bought or what people read or and if they told anybody
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:37:00.400]  they'd be arrested but the librarians just revolted and said no and then it was
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:08.560]  stopped this is secret police and I know the cases and I know what's going on and
[1:37:08.560 --> 1:37:13.680]  they say oh well it's complicated no it's not complicated ladies and gentlemen
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:18.100]  it's not complicated when Ronald manual comes out and says the executive will
[1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:23.920]  decide whether to put you on a no fly list or not and there's over a million
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:27.520]  people on this thing now and it's really a no buy and sell list when you're on
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:31.160]  that list through Patriot Act compliance it waves the fourth amendment
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:34.600]  everything the fifth amendment you have to incriminate yourself to get a car a
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:40.440]  car loan a rent car an apartment a house a hotel room plane tickets this is a
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:44.520]  control grid to snoop and track everything we do take know your customer
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:48.000]  that totally violates the fourth and fifth amendment all you want to have a
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:51.840]  bank account with us will sign this contract see government is compelling
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:58.560]  it so it's not a contract agreement in the free market it's a fraud and we'll
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:02.600]  just watch everything you do on your bank account with no warrant it's like
[1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:05.400]  filling out an IRS form well they go well we've got it I mean in that
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:10.320]  precedent no we didn't have until 1913 it wasn't made mainstream for all
[1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:16.960]  Americans until the 50s things are changing for the worst they can have
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:22.360]  lawyers try to polish it up but it still is what it is you know what you can't
[1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:28.840]  polish folks I'm not gonna say it but they have you fill out those tax forms
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:34.040]  every year that incriminate yourself it says this will incriminate you fill it
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:40.120]  out send it to us and there's any mistakes you're a criminal but government
[1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:44.320]  can make all the mistakes they want and they make themselves exempt from all
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:48.080]  their laws you know people are emailing me and calling me and posting in the
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:51.560]  comment sections every time we post an article or link the story about another
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:57.680]  Obama nominee having to withdraw whether it's Tom Dashow or all these other
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:02.320]  people Geithner he didn't pay his taxes but they say that's all right
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:14.480]  everyone Alex I guess you're really telling the truth Alex I guess you're
[1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:18.200]  telling the truth it doesn't like it's more than 50% of these politicians don't
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:22.360]  pay taxes or don't pay my folks I'm not making that up I just haven't pulled up
[1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:26.040]  the article from years ago I've I mean seen a bunch of them Washington Post
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:32.880]  Washington Times or it you know the majority of Congress doesn't pay taxes
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:38.160]  period or hasn't paid taxes in years in fact let's do this now guys Google this
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:44.160]  for me I could do a little bit I can't really talk and focus and Google while I'm
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:48.760]  on there I guess I could but Google let me give an exact headline to try to pull
[1:39:48.760 --> 1:40:01.360]  it up one of the many headlines hundreds in Congress in tax trouble hundreds in
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:05.680]  Congress in tax trouble then it'll say in there the majority of them having
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:10.520]  paid taxes in years hundreds in Congress in tax trouble or hunt those are not in
[1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:18.400]  tax trouble that because they're not in trouble many in Congress don't pay taxes
[1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:23.680]  that should pull it up now the problem is you're clicking news so it's all about
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:27.240]  his latest nominees
[1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:42.360]  somebody can find it if he can't and put it up put it up on the prison planet
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:47.440]  dot com forum finding stuff four or five years old is hard but many in
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:59.320]  Congress don't pay taxes try over 60% of Congress not paying taxes Congress not
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:05.120]  paying taxes or congressmen not paying taxes that should bring it up before I
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:13.280]  go to your phone calls I do want to encourage all the listeners of this
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:17.000]  radio show to support this transmission we are really trying to expand this
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:21.360]  operation a lot of fresh faces here in the office we just hired in two new
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:28.320]  producers one of them is going to do video work on 5050 so another video
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:34.400]  editor slash board op slash TV director another producer slash board operator
[1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:44.760]  TV director we just hired two new customer service people which includes
[1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:52.360]  shipping we're looking at IT people this week doing interviews we just hired
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:57.880]  over hiring two more salesmen that they pay for themselves and then we're going
[1:41:57.880 --> 1:42:04.440]  to hire a bookkeeper just to try to keep track of all this insanity
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:09.920]  because Mike's overwhelmed trying to do it all Mike Nelson and we're gonna be
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:13.240]  able to get a lot more work done a lot more films a lot more TV shows a lot more
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:18.520]  media better websites the websites expanding new features to the websites
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:28.080]  redesigned a prison planet dot TV and this is I mean about a millions people
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:30.640]  find the new world order and certainly the credit goes around everybody I'm
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:34.680]  just saying we are the biggest piece of the puzzle there's hundreds of big pieces
[1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:40.440]  thousands and millions of little pieces but on this mosaic of puzzle pieces we
[1:42:40.440 --> 1:42:48.120]  are a huge piece of that I mean I talked to folks all around the country and they
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:51.360]  say you woke me up you woke me up and everybody I talked to woke up from this
[1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:56.280]  radio show or from your films the vast majority of guests we talked to say that
[1:42:56.280 --> 1:43:00.360]  the most support they get the biggest response they get isn't on other big
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:04.120]  national shows it's it's this radio show and that's because of you the great
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:10.440]  active listeners well if you think we've gotten a lot done thanks to listeners
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:15.800]  spread the word and take an action think what will happen if more of you spread
[1:43:15.800 --> 1:43:19.560]  the word more buy more of the books and videos make copies of my films give them
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:23.040]  to people put them on access TV what will happen if you purchase more of the
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:27.720]  books and videos so we have the capital to get things done I want to grow
[1:43:27.720 --> 1:43:32.440]  exponentially I don't want to just stay the same size I've waited too long I
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:36.000]  think every day I kick myself for what we could have done if I would have taken
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:41.240]  action and expanded earlier we're doing it now during a major implosion but
[1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:52.200]  we're needed we are needed our work is vital and so we're upping our game we
[1:43:52.200 --> 1:44:04.080]  are expanding everything we do because it's all been so effective now I'm not
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:07.440]  going to belabor this but we have the third installment just came out last

[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:15.160]  to digress but I've been trying to call you since last Friday to tell you this
[1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:19.720]  and I'm actually just getting through now but I just wanted to tell you what a
[1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:24.040]  phenomenal phenomenal phenomenal show you had last week Thursday when you had on
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:30.200]  our Jordan Maxwell mostly because I didn't know much about them and after
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:33.800]  your show I did some research and to find out that the movies I guys was
[1:46:33.800 --> 1:46:39.920]  based off of him that actually woke me up and helped me find out about you so
[1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:45.920]  it was just a real full circle to find out more about them and just how
[1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:50.360]  important he is about a lot of the stuff that's going on now and also I just
[1:46:50.360 --> 1:46:56.960]  wanted to say that I checked out a blog site and see the show that KRS one did
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:02.720]  in Austin and that is what and I just want to say that that was really huge
[1:47:02.720 --> 1:47:07.220]  that you're working with him because gave me a little bit of hope that not
[1:47:07.220 --> 1:47:10.360]  everybody is sleeping and for him to speak out the way he was speaking out
[1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:14.840]  about Obama and just what's going on to educate because he's pretty respected
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:19.160]  in the in that realm so well let me just say this I want to check into this we
[1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:25.560]  streamed it live the KRS one interview at prisonplanet.tv last Friday but that
[1:47:25.560 --> 1:47:29.920]  was in medium quality we stream live in medium quality so basically everybody
[1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:33.800]  with their connection can get it and so it doesn't overwhelm our servers but I
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:37.840]  know last week they uploaded it in super high quality for prisonplanet.tv
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:43.240]  members but I don't see it up there did Paul Watson or did our guys ever post
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:50.960]  the super high quality KRS R1 to prisonplanet.tv you guys call Aaron in
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:55.640]  here because I see it all over the web with hundreds of thousands of views and
[1:47:55.640 --> 1:47:59.520]  it's in low quality because by the time people copy the meat medium quality it
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:02.880]  looks low quality so we'll find out what happened with that because I want that
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:06.400]  KRS R1 out there in high quality that always happens some super interview
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:09.720]  breaks in medium quality and then it gets it all over the web and then there'll
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:13.280]  be high quality versions folks don't even know about but yeah we're gonna have
[1:48:13.280 --> 1:48:17.560]  KRS R1 back on he's invited me to be part of a speaking tour if I can't I
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:21.120]  shouldn't have the time really at least go to one of them and we got
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:31.800]  professor griff coming on Thursday so that's going on you know just talking
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:35.520]  he was going in really in depth and of course talked about you and how important
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:41.520]  you are and it was just a really good feeling to just to see him talk so
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:45.920]  so much in depth about what's going on and I just really also want to find out
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:51.040]  going back to doing the Maxwell it was just a really big moment and I just really
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:54.520]  want to know when are you actually gonna go out there to see him so you can try
[1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:58.160]  to get this information to us because I think what he was talking about was
[1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:03.520]  just it's mild and I'm just really eager to find out the information that you
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:07.400]  guys are planning to you know the I guess the piece together and here's the
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:13.880]  problem I've had a skeleton crew and so I've not been able to do one one
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:18.720]  hundredth of what I would like to and I've told Jordan and I'm honored he
[1:49:18.720 --> 1:49:24.400]  wants me to make a film with him that he needs to give me a battle plan because
[1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:29.000]  even when I have a battle plan you know it takes a lot of sleepless hours to get
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:37.160]  a good film made on top of everything else we're doing and so I left town last
[1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:40.080]  Thursday after I talked to him so I need to call him today on top of everything
[1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:49.280]  else and see if he wants to get that done also you know I I generally like
[1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:52.000]  working with myself and I'll go interview people for films and things I
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:56.080]  just it's not that I don't want to have somebody else on showing something it's
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:00.440]  that I can barely get something done when I'm on showing it when I'm driving
[1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:14.000]  the train and I just time is so short time is so short and so just you know
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:18.880]  like you always have these shows that really just for me at least it just gives
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:23.920]  me really big chills you know going from Steve Coyle to Lindsay Williams back to
[1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:28.360]  Jordan is like when you know these guys announce or they just come on and they
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:33.520]  speak about really amazing news and it's almost kind of like they give you
[1:50:33.520 --> 1:50:37.160]  information on what these guys are really thinking and the motives that they're
[1:50:37.160 --> 1:50:42.040]  planning and try to accomplish so that was just another one of the episodes that

[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:21.360]  go ahead and call Peter Schiff I want to start the show directly with him thank
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:31.160]  you where did my guest folder go we've been track of this stuff it's crazy in
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:44.120]  here let's go ahead and take a call from James and PA James are on the air hey
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  Alex hey take my call I got a statement and a question for you the first one is
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:57.200]  that my girlfriend's mom is an RN at a hospital in New York State I live right
[1:54:57.200 --> 1:55:03.440]  on the border and she she told me that the hospital has told them to take all
[1:55:03.440 --> 1:55:07.480]  their extra medication and flush it down the toilet so then you got the news
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:12.480]  saying that that the medication in the water is coming from people urinating it
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:17.120]  out which is totally BS because hospitals themselves are flushing all
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:24.600]  these pills down the toilet I don't I know they don't like them throwing it in
[1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:30.560]  the garbage because people raid the landfills to get the drugs but they're
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:35.400]  supposed to incinerate old drugs I know the abortion where he's flush babies
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:38.960]  down the toilet down the sink of people don't like they put them in blenders
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:41.480]  folks don't like hearing that but it's just the facts what we do to our own
[1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:45.960]  humanity we can rationalize it all day but it's all about eugenics they're
[1:55:45.960 --> 1:55:49.960]  pushing all over the news now major offensive launch there but there are
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:54.240]  water supplies that aren't connected to sewage that aren't connected to waste
[1:55:54.240 --> 1:55:59.440]  water that shouldn't have the drugs in them and and even in the areas where it
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:05.920]  is connected to wastewater it's it levels way above what could possibly be in
[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:14.240]  there so clearly I mean sodium fluoride itself is a prozac like drug and so they
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:17.600]  are drugging the water supply
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:19.640]  i totally agree with you there might
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:23.120]  my next question is for you about uh... jordan maxwell
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:27.640]  i've been doing some research on him and it i've come to find that a lot of the
[1:56:27.640 --> 1:56:32.040]  stuff that he teaches comes from the mystery religions itself like Helena
[1:56:32.040 --> 1:56:33.640]  bob latke
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:37.680]  and his name like it could be his real name but
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:39.520]  and um...
[1:56:39.520 --> 1:56:44.480]  and lina bob latke's ice and failed by him too it states she states that the
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:47.920]  second part of the nazarene trinity trinity is this
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:49.520]  person called jordania
[1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:51.520]  maximus who is
[1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:53.000]  the water of life
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.480]  through only him can we all be saved
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:56:58.760]  and then if you go on his website and look at the uh...
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:02.320]  you know the little thing about researching words one word is jordania
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:05.640]  maximus and there's a little clip next to it that says
[1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:09.080]  some rabbi sent him this information
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:13.600]  about jordania maximus but if he's even stated himself that Helena bob latke is
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:15.640]  one of his favorite authors
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:19.280]  i was wondering what i mean i was about to say this is what happens
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:21.280]  people cover things
[1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:24.080]  on the air and in their own books and in folks
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:26.520]  get it so we found a secret
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:28.360]  uh... about this person
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:29.720]  um...
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:33.560]  when the person is openly that that's what he's covering is the mystery
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:34.760]  religions
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:37.440]  that's uh... what he studies
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:42.280]  and uh... know his name is not jordan max well he said on air many years ago
[1:57:42.280 --> 1:57:43.200]  you know that he
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:45.680]  picked that name up when he was first starting all this is getting death
[1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:46.920]  threats
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:49.160]  uh... so
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:52.160]  i mean i'll say things on tv
[1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:53.960]  and then they'll grab the clip and say
[1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:57.120]  we found the secret video of uh... alex
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:58:00.200]  when it was me on error or you know behind the scenes during the breaks we
[1:58:00.200 --> 1:58:01.320]  skip a lot of them
[1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:03.360]  openly keep talking to folks
[1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:05.840]  uh... so i mean they look
[1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:09.920]  anybody and everybody that covers news information is being attacked and and
[1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:13.320]  and you know being gone after uh...
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:16.400]  and we have jordan on because he's got a lot of key information about the new
[1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:17.640]  world order
[1:58:17.640 --> 1:58:19.280]  and uh...
[1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:22.320]  so of course he's very popular people are criticizing
[1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:25.800]  and they criticize me even more because it gets to me
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:29.880]  uh... so they just do that i mean you know it's research information take from
[1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:32.200]  it what you
[1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:34.600]  is really the bottom line i appreciate your call

[2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:55.360]  few minutes well this from slash dot today and it's also in several other
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:01:02.800]  news articles amtrak photo contestant arrested by amtrak police all over the
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:08.360]  nation you'll have a chemistry professor arrested because he has a chemistry
[2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:11.800]  professor this house in a neighbor or carpet cleaner saw it and thought he was
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:19.960]  a terrorist you'll have many famous cases of students who are out doing a
[2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:26.520]  photo journalism class of bridges or of buildings or of architecture period and
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:31.960]  they get arrested and this is how they're using the war on terror to crel's
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:35.160]  paranoia we've had new york police walk up and say turn your video cameras
[2:01:35.160 --> 2:01:40.480]  offering a protest you know you can be terrorist that camera is a gun so just
[2:01:40.480 --> 2:01:47.320]  tyranny of and it goes on to see photographer dwayne kerzik was standing
[2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:54.080]  on the public platform in new york's pin station taking pictures of trains in
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:57.120]  hopes of winning an annual photo contest that amtrak have been running since
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:01.080]  2003 and track police arrested him refusing to delete the photos when asked
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:04.880]  though they later charged him with trespassing obviously there is a lack of
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:08.120]  communication when amtrak's marketing department which promotes the annual
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:12.440]  contest called picture our trains and its police department which has a history
[2:02:12.440 --> 2:02:16.400]  of harassing photographers for photographing the same trains not much
[2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:19.720]  different than the jet blue incident from earlier this year when jet blue
[2:02:19.720 --> 2:02:25.480]  flight attendants had a woman arrested for refusing to delete a video she
[2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:29.720]  filmed in flight while the jet blue marketing department hosted a contest
[2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:33.800]  encouraging passengers to take photos in flight kerzik's blog has an account of
[2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:39.040]  the arrest on december 21st and the aftermath we're going to get him on the
[2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:44.320]  show and this happens all over the place i mean you'll be taking pictures out of
[2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:48.120]  the plane window your little snapshot camera and i've had the flight into
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:53.720]  walkover and say don't take pictures in here and this is all just part of the
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:56.600]  first amendment being attacked there's nothing to do with terrorism and how
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:03:00.280]  they're using this but a chilling effect on free speech and alternative media
[2:03:00.280 --> 2:03:04.120]  gathering and now they're trying to pass on england where you're a terrorist if
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:07.120]  you take pictures of police period so you can't videotape them or photograph
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:11.880]  them beating people up okay until the bottom of the hour we have peter shift
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:15.840]  on with us and i want to go through some of the economic numbers that are
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:19.840]  coming out he and many others have been predicting we could go into a
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:24.920]  depression the next few years but now mainline economist magazine and gordon
[2:03:24.920 --> 2:03:27.400]  brown prime minister of england yesterday said that we're already in a
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:31.000]  depression uh... so peter chef of europe a civic capital
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:34.280]  uh... do you think we're already going into a depression
[2:03:34.280 --> 2:03:37.480]  well unfortunately i think we are i think the government is leading us into a
[2:03:37.480 --> 2:03:40.240]  depression i don't think it had to be a depression
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:42.920]  i think it had to be a very severe recession
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:46.320]  uh... because we have a lot of problems in our economy that have been building
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:46.920]  for
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:49.680]  bill more than a generation but it particular
[2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:53.160]  uh... during the green span era and that's it's the birthday of the dot com
[2:03:53.160 --> 2:03:56.640]  bubble we have some serious in battles of the need to be addressed
[2:03:56.640 --> 2:04:00.880]  and a lot of these problems are the result of monetary fiscal mismanagement
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:04.240]  and uh... and uh... an excessive by regulation
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:05.760]  uh... but uh... you know
[2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:10.280]  we we need to allow the market to to uh... to work and the function and
[2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:13.600]  unfortunately the government is not doing that the government is simply
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:17.200]  uh... you know exacerbating the problem there they're leading us deeper into

[2:08:56.800 --> 2:08:59.920]  predictions and projections forecast you've made accurately i think it's
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:02.480]  important to recap those i could go over some of them but you
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:05.920]  i could do it better than i because you made them and then some people take
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:10.880]  seriously what you're saying uh let's move forward uh then into
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:15.680]  your forecast on the depression and exactly why that's being exacerbated
[2:09:15.680 --> 2:09:21.840]  and accelerated by the policies like a 50 something million dollar bailout
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:26.080]  they're talking about for the auto industry so ford and chevy and others
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:31.200]  can move to brazil pier chef and well i mean basically i've been
[2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:35.200]  pointing out for a number of years uh the the
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:38.720]  problems the underlying problems with our economy and you know what we're
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:42.320]  experiencing now is is not the problem what we're finally
[2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:45.840]  experiencing are the consequences of the problem and the problem
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:49.520]  has been building as i said for years and years and basically
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:53.200]  you know the roots of the problem you can probably trace them back to
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:56.400]  abandoning the gold standard in 1971 because what
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:09:59.920]  when we when we took the dollar off the gold standard and the world
[2:09:59.920 --> 2:10:03.280]  continued to accept the u.s. dollar as the reserve currency
[2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:08.400]  as if it were still backed by gold that put us in a unique position as a nation
[2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:12.000]  where we could pay for our imports by printing money we didn't have to pay
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:15.040]  for our exports with exports and we didn't have to
[2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:17.520]  pay for them with gold we could just print money
[2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:21.040]  and and that really started this process that culminated
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:26.240]  you know in uh you know after the dot coms i think from 2001 2002
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:31.360]  until 2008 we basically went through the mania of the blow-off stage of this
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:37.200]  phony economy but what happened is we began to deindustrialize and we began
[2:10:37.200 --> 2:10:41.200]  to move into a service sector economy because we're able to import all the
[2:10:41.200 --> 2:10:44.640]  things that we didn't produce by printing money and sending it abroad and
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:48.000]  our creditors were willing to hang on to the money we printed
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:51.920]  and they didn't look to actually spend it on real stuff and so the economy
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:55.680]  began to evolve this this consumer-based economy
[2:10:55.680 --> 2:10:59.520]  but in order to keep it growing we had to keep on taking on ever increasing
[2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:03.760]  quantities of debt which the world was willing to supply us
[2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:06.800]  and you know of course with the housing bubble which when i was very critical
[2:11:06.800 --> 2:11:09.680]  there that's what enabled americans to borrow money
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:13.040]  on an unprecedented scale i mean we raised it at the end of the
[2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:15.520]  to an art form where we were borrowing you know
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:19.200]  literally trillions of dollars from the world and we were just blowing it all
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:21.680]  on massive consumption in our trade deficit
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:25.440]  you know during the the this decade you know went from you know what used to be
[2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:29.760]  a pretty bad you know 10 12 billion a month up to 60 billion 70 billion a
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:32.320]  month and uh this was completely
[2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:36.880]  unsustainable and then you know you had uh you know half of the the income from
[2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:41.280]  the smp 500 was being generated uh from finance from financial services and it
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:45.280]  was all an illusion and i saw all the risks that were
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:48.640]  being taken uh on wall street and all the speculation on
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:51.360]  main street i knew that our whole banking system
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:54.160]  was a house of cards because i knew that the assets
[2:11:54.160 --> 2:11:57.360]  uh were phony because the assets were mortgages
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:00.480]  and i knew that the people who were borrowing money it there's no way they
[2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:03.440]  could pay it back sorry to interrupt you can your voice is so
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:07.680]  strong will you back off your phone okay sure thank you sorry
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:12.480]  uh to to interrupt you uh absolutely and and then on top of that the big banks
[2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:15.840]  and brokerage firms then took the security backed assets the
[2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:19.200]  the mortgage loans and sold those as as
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:22.880]  basically good as gold well that they yeah they had to sell them because we
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:26.560]  don't have any savings i mean this whole securitization process
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:29.840]  was a way to put together american borrowers
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:33.040]  with all the world's savers i mean you can only borrow money
[2:12:33.040 --> 2:12:38.560]  from somebody who saved it and so this this process enabled wall street to put
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:41.360]  the japanese and the chinese together with the americans
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:45.040]  but all we were doing was borrowing money and you know the chinese and you know
[2:12:45.040 --> 2:12:47.840]  they were dumb enough to let it to us they thought they were going to get it
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:51.200]  back but you know they're not going to get it back because we spent the money
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:54.640]  we have no way of paying it back it wasn't it wasn't put to a productive
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:58.720]  use it was spent but anyway so i knew that there that
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:02.320]  this was going to end badly this phony credit bubble economy
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:06.000]  uh based on consumer spending and debt was going to collapse and that's what's
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  begun now what when i when i was warning about it
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:14.960]  i was more fearful not of the collapse but of the things that the government
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:18.320]  would do to try to interfere with the collapse
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:22.000]  to try to reflate the bubble to try to return us
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:26.640]  to the consumer spending economy that is the source of our problems
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:29.840]  and that is exactly what the government is trying to do
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:35.040]  and in so doing what they're really doing is pouring gasoline on a raging
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:38.240]  fire and it is going to you know basically
[2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:43.600]  engulf the entire country and burn it to the ground
[2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:47.440]  and every time the fire gets bigger they're going to pour more gasoline on it
[2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:52.000]  what we need the only way that america is going to get back on the right track
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:57.840]  is to have consumers stop spending we need to rebuild savings we need capital
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:01.760]  to be made available to business not government so that business can use it
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:05.600]  to produce the factories of the future to employ the workers that are losing
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:10.320]  their jobs and services and and finance we need to allow the free market to work
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:14.000]  and it's going to involve a lot of pain because all this artificial
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:18.160]  living all this living beyond our means and indulging our every whim and buying
[2:14:18.160 --> 2:14:21.440]  things we can't afford that's got to come to an end
[2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:25.040]  and it's not going to be an easy process and during the process
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:28.800]  asset prices are going to be marked down stock prices need to go lower
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:32.720]  real estate prices need to go lower uh people that's not going to sit well
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:35.680]  with a lot of people who who thought they were going to get rich on asset
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:38.880]  appreciation but we need to go back to reality
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:41.840]  but what the government is going to do is they're going to prevent all this
[2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:44.560]  from happening they're going to prevent us from getting out of this hole
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:47.920]  they're going to dig it deeper they're trying to encourage more reckless
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:52.080]  consumption the entire purpose of the stimulus package
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:55.520]  and all the bailouts is to keep americans going to the mall
[2:14:55.520 --> 2:14:59.520]  to keep us reaching for our charge cards buying more stuff they want us
[2:14:59.520 --> 2:15:02.880]  borrowing more money to buy more houses they want us borrowing more money to buy
[2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:06.400]  more cars uh that is the exact opposite of what we
[2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:10.320]  need to do and what they are setting up is the real crisis that i've been
[2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:13.600]  warning about it's going to be a collapse of the value of the dollar
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:17.200]  it's coming it's coming soon and when the dollar collapses
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:20.560]  you're going to see interest rates spiral out of control you're going to see
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:24.320]  consumer prices spiraling out of control and then we're going to be in a real
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:28.000]  crisis because see right now the government is bailing everybody out
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:31.920]  and using the pain but when the bond market collapses it's the u.s. government
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:35.280]  that's going to bail out and there's nobody big enough to do it
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:39.680]  peter schiff what is the time frame and i know these are liquid and and and move
[2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:43.120]  back and forth but uh most the experts we talked to
[2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:47.680]  by dr paul greg roberts and bob Chapman and uh the head of newark business
[2:15:47.680 --> 2:15:51.760]  school and and and countless others say that what government is doing
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:56.160]  uh is accelerating the time frame and bringing the total collapse the what i
[2:15:56.160 --> 2:16:03.120]  call hyper stag inflation uh closer to uh reality
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:05.760]  yeah i mean i i don't it's hard to say you know
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:09.840]  exactly timing i mean timing is a is a very difficult thing
[2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:13.040]  to do especially when there's so much irrationality
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:16.400]  uh in the world and there's so much manipulation there's so many people
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:20.160]  with vested interests so you can never know the timing look we had this huge
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:25.600]  dollar rally uh in 2008 that bought us a lot of time
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:29.200]  uh i didn't anticipate that we have that big dollar rally maybe in hindsight
[2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:32.240]  it's something i should have anticipated because in the short run
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:36.000]  it seems like the opposite of what should happen always happens because
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:39.760]  the majority of people seem to always get it wrong and they do the wrong thing
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:43.040]  uh you know when they initially are confronted with information
[2:16:43.040 --> 2:16:46.800]  but once this dollar rally really loses steam and begins to fall apart it's
[2:16:46.800 --> 2:16:50.800]  going to take on a lot of momentum and that's what's happening
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:54.160]  yeah look at the bond market i mean this is that the bond market has been
[2:16:54.160 --> 2:16:59.440]  dropping every day this year in fact so far 2009
[2:16:59.440 --> 2:17:03.760]  is the worst year in history for the u.s bond market it's the worst year
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:07.360]  even though we've only finished one month of the year and the worst continues
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:11.280]  this could be the beginning of the unraveling and the worst year in stock
[2:17:11.280 --> 2:17:14.240]  summer well it's the worst january in stock
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:19.360]  ever yes but it's not the worst year but it's already the worst year in bond
[2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:23.680]  i mean january was worse than any entire year that preceded it that's how bad it
[2:17:23.680 --> 2:17:27.040]  was okay so
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:32.240]  um what's the furthest it could be pushed out until
[2:17:32.240 --> 2:17:35.040]  i mean the layoffs hundreds of thousands a month
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:38.880]  the store shutdowns and now the bubble in the real estate market
[2:17:38.880 --> 2:17:42.800]  uh is starting to implode the credit card debt is starting to implode
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:47.520]  i mean is all these things combined with the already
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:51.680]  uh circling black hole what a year till
[2:17:51.680 --> 2:17:56.560]  it's riots in the streets two years i don't know i mean i've talked about the
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:18:00.560]  potential for riots and i think that exists and looting and i think what
[2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:05.360]  would cause that would be shortages of food and blackouts and i think that it
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:08.720]  is possible that we will see that because the government is unleashing
[2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:12.800]  massive inflation and ultimately the inflation that they're creating is going
[2:18:12.800 --> 2:18:17.120]  to cause surging prices particularly for things like food and
[2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:21.760]  energy and if the government is going to stick to form
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.280]  they are going to attack the symptoms and not the disease
[2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:28.400]  which is the rising prices and the only way governments ever
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:32.160]  attack rising prices is through price controls which is what
[2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:36.960]  uh we did in the 1970s and since we're repeating all the mistakes of the 1930s
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:39.920]  i'm sure we'll repeat the mistakes of the 1970s
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:43.600]  and if we have price controls we're going to have shortages and if we have
[2:18:43.600 --> 2:18:46.720]  shortages we're going to have problems we're going to have crime
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:49.440]  and of course i think it's going to come at a time
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:53.600]  you know where the cities are not going to have the money and the resources
[2:18:53.600 --> 2:18:57.120]  to pay for additional police protection if not they might not even if they
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:19:00.320]  might have to cut back on the police protection they have now
[2:19:00.320 --> 2:19:03.120]  and obviously you know the criminals will figure that out
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:06.480]  well peter that was my next question we come back i want to get into that
[2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:10.080]  uh the states are on the verge of bankruptcy calpers
[2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:13.600]  uh for those that don't know the big pension fund system in california
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:16.800]  formerly one of the biggest economies in the world with numbers eight in the
[2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:21.280]  world itself just that fund not california itself but just the fund
[2:19:21.280 --> 2:19:24.560]  uh they're talking about that going bankrupt they're doing emergency rainy

[2:19:28.160 --> 2:19:32.080]  danger of not going out that'll be a riot within a week uh the pentagon is

[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:31.600]  lot from peter schiff again is our guest
[2:24:31.600 --> 2:24:35.360]  here let's get into it right now you talked about police agencies not having
[2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:39.120]  enough money they swole the size of police agencies from
[2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:42.720]  500 000 to several million in the last decade
[2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:46.160]  uh now the police admit they're out riding more tickets and fines and fees to
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:49.280]  try to raise money but of the people you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip or
[2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:53.360]  a stone as the old sayings go uh the states are talking
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:56.800]  about going bankrupt the pension funds the state pension funds the police
[2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:00.960]  pension funds i mean if all of that goes bankrupt what are we
[2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:03.040]  or even part of it what are we looking at here
[2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:07.680]  yeah look at stuff look this is the natural consequence of all this
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:11.760]  debt all this borrowing to consume and that that's how come you know our
[2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:17.040]  economy was phony we were paying for it by going into debt and everybody you
[2:25:17.040 --> 2:25:19.920]  know when i would bring this up and talk about all the debt
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:23.440]  they people would criticize me by saying look i'm only looking at half the
[2:25:23.440 --> 2:25:26.640]  balance sheet i'm not looking at all the assets and so we have
[2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:30.720]  all these assets so the debt is okay well what were the assets the assets
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:34.560]  were stocks and real estate but what good are those
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:36.800]  assets i mean we can talk we can we can
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:40.560]  hack them all to the chinese you know we have to pay interest on the debt
[2:25:40.560 --> 2:25:44.640]  and if we can't service the debt it doesn't matter about the assets
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:48.560]  and of course when you have to sell your assets the prices collapse i mean
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:52.720]  our houses are only worth a lot of money assuming that nobody wants to sell them
[2:25:52.720 --> 2:25:56.000]  but the minute everybody needs to sell their house there's nobody to buy it
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:59.040]  what's your house worth it's worth a fraction of what we were pretending it
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:02.560]  was worth when we tried to pretend that all this debt didn't matter
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:06.480]  but it does matter and now the bills are coming due and we can't pay
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:10.000]  in the meantime you know what made us wealthy in the first place
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:14.560]  our industrial might our ability to produce you know that's gone
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:17.360]  because we've been living off the productivity of everybody else as we've
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:20.560]  been accumulating all this debt
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:25.280]  looking specifically at calpers out in california and other states where do you
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:29.520]  see the biggest problems what do you see to be the next domino to fall states
[2:26:29.520 --> 2:26:33.200]  going bankrupt i saw a headline in mainstream news yesterday of 48 states
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:37.120]  may go into bankruptcy most of the state in california is i think on the verge
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:41.200]  if they haven't already done so of paying some of their bills with iow's
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:45.520]  and um you know ultimately i think barack obama you know as and the
[2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:50.560]  government have mentioned the desire to give money to the state and i think
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:54.960]  some of this new bailout bills stimulus bill whatever they call it
[2:26:54.960 --> 2:26:58.800]  that they're passing i think it has some money for the state
[2:26:58.800 --> 2:27:02.080]  so that the states don't have to make cuts well
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:05.440]  that's the wrong thing to do the states need to make cuts
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:09.760]  the states are bloated um you know we need uh reductions there
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:12.320]  if we're just going to print money and give it to the states so they don't
[2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:16.480]  they don't make necessary cuts we're just making the underlying problems
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:20.080]  worse and that's just going to inflate the currency more isn't it
[2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:23.280]  well that's all they're doing they have to print money now they're hoping that
[2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:26.640]  they can keep borrowing the money from the chinese and the japanese and the
[2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:29.680]  saudis but the world is suffering right now
[2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:33.760]  from all the money they loaned us in the past that we can't pay back
[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:36.720]  could it why should they sign up to loan us even more
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:41.840]  could it get to zimbabwean level it could i mean there's no difference
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:44.640]  between our money and theirs it's just paper
[2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:49.760]  uh and i'm hoping it doesn't get that bad but it will get that bad if we do not
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:54.640]  change course we need to make a conscious decision to reverse our course
[2:27:54.640 --> 2:27:58.000]  and to and to and to accept whatever pain
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:02.960]  the recession is going to uh it dole out because there's no way around it
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:07.520]  try it's trying to avoid the pain trying to accept from dealing with reality
[2:28:07.520 --> 2:28:11.520]  that's why you end up with a hyperinflation snare because you refuse
[2:28:11.520 --> 2:28:15.360]  uh to to bite the bullet and so instead you
[2:28:15.360 --> 2:28:20.400]  you know you died from the wound yeah i've got a list of the nine hundred
[2:28:20.400 --> 2:28:24.320]  billion dollar now stimulus package and it's for cities
[2:28:24.320 --> 2:28:28.960]  to build new golf courses it like right here in austin a river walk
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:32.960]  uh i mean think about it think about how ridiculous that sounds we are in an
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:36.880]  economic we're in trouble right we've we've borrowed and spent too much
[2:28:36.880 --> 2:28:40.240]  money we need to you know to dig in our horns we need to
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:44.560]  sacrifice we need to save more and stop spending and what's their solution
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:47.920]  build more golf courses i mean they gotta be crazy
[2:28:47.920 --> 2:28:51.200]  how how is another golf course going to make us more productive
[2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:54.880]  we need a factory we need to make things we don't need more golf courses you
[2:28:54.880 --> 2:28:58.960]  know we've got plenty of golf courses well people are going to have money to
[2:28:58.960 --> 2:29:01.840]  spend at the golf course well we don't have we don't have

[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:48.960]  timothy geithner who engineered much of the economic crises we now see
[2:33:48.960 --> 2:33:52.640]  who lobby to get rid of the uh... different acts
[2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:57.840]  uh... in the nineteen nineties that allowed all of this derivative
[2:33:57.840 --> 2:34:01.200]  manipulation to expand as you know but for the audience
[2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:07.280]  uh... he is now coming out and saying obama warns of catastrophe without
[2:34:07.280 --> 2:34:11.840]  stimulus without these uh...
[2:34:11.840 --> 2:34:15.520]  literally here in austin uh... frisbee golf courses
[2:34:15.520 --> 2:34:19.520]  you couldn't make this up uh... yacht clubs
[2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:23.440]  uh... political payoffs buying off churches i mean this is just a big
[2:34:23.440 --> 2:34:25.520]  political pay off the biggest pork ever seen
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:28.480]  of course it's this nine hundred billions of distraction compared to the
[2:34:28.480 --> 2:34:31.360]  trillions the federal reserve is taken they won't say where it's gone but i
[2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:33.280]  want to talk about that separately
[2:34:33.280 --> 2:34:37.200]  barack obama a what do you think of what he's doing
[2:34:37.200 --> 2:34:40.560]  uh... he lobbied for the original banker bailout now he's criticizing the
[2:34:40.560 --> 2:34:41.920]  banker bailout i mean how
[2:34:41.920 --> 2:34:44.800]  how hypocritical is that him claiming he's not involved
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:47.840]  in the october third banker bailout but
[2:34:47.840 --> 2:34:51.680]  he was actually instrumental in hanchoing it through congress
[2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:54.320]  we have the video clips to prove it of him on the floor of the senate
[2:34:54.320 --> 2:34:56.480]  and where do you see all this going
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:35:00.640]  these guys had to go to me i mean mccain i was on the cover show yesterday
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:04.000]  mccain was on and you know he's talking against the bailout but i mean he
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:07.360]  made a point that he stopped his campaign to go back to washington to vote
[2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:08.400]  for it
[2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:11.120]  and you know it and now he's against it but you know first i just want to
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:14.640]  correct something that you said i i don't manage your fun i don't i i own a
[2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:17.840]  brokerage firm europe Pacific capital where it were a brokerage firm
[2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:20.400]  individual investors you know put up a cow with me
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:23.840]  they can invest in foreign stocks the domestic stock and they want to sell
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:24.800]  precious metals
[2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:28.400]  but we're just a full service uh... retail investment from i don't manage
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:30.640]  any money at all it got it um... yeah
[2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:34.560]  um... anyway so um although i am starting i just actually set up a registered
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:38.320]  investment advisor so it is my intention to start managing money
[2:35:38.320 --> 2:35:42.240]  but we haven't managed any at the date except except my own
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:47.120]  but anyway you know what's happening right now you know with um...
[2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:51.280]  with obama and and and and government in general they are using this economic
[2:35:51.280 --> 2:35:52.240]  crisis
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:55.920]  uh... as a means to just to to get
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:36:01.040]  a big government agenda uh... passed and and this is this is playing
[2:36:01.040 --> 2:36:04.240]  right into their their hands it's music to their ears
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:08.240]  politicians love a crisis especially when they can say the only solution is
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:09.360]  more government
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:11.440]  and and and unfortunately
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:13.360]  the crisis is going to get worse
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:16.720]  you're still more government we get the biggest problem and of course
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:20.560]  that is exactly what the government wants the worst they make the economy
[2:36:20.560 --> 2:36:24.640]  the more justification they have to get even more powerful and even more
[2:36:24.640 --> 2:36:25.280]  government
[2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:27.840]  so you're still can't lose the politicians can't lose
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:30.400]  the worst they make it the better they are
[2:36:30.400 --> 2:36:33.120]  peter say that again in your own words you're you're really overdrive on the
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:35.440]  phone i need you to back off again i'm sorry to stop you
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:39.280]  i mean flesh that out take your time explaining that because that's key and
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:40.160]  explain
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:44.000]  uh... you know why this is actually good for them but not for the rest of us
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:44.800]  go ahead
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:47.840]  right well if you look at the government is like government is like a
[2:36:47.840 --> 2:36:51.840]  a parasite or a cancer and and the rest of us you know are the host and
[2:36:51.840 --> 2:36:55.040]  you know what's good for the the parasite is not necessarily good for the
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:36:55.680]  host
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:36:56.960]  they want to get bigger
[2:36:56.960 --> 2:36:59.600]  uh... in and they're gonna feed off of us
[2:36:59.600 --> 2:37:01.360]  and and the more
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:02.400]  government
[2:37:02.400 --> 2:37:04.720]  they create to solve the problem
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:07.120]  the bigger the problem is going to become
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:10.080]  and so the worst they make the economy
[2:37:10.080 --> 2:37:14.400]  the more they create the need for government solutions to solve it
[2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:15.920]  and so they the government
[2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:19.520]  can't lose in this situation unless of course we vote them out
[2:37:19.520 --> 2:37:22.960]  but in general we won't do that i mean rusev all prove that he got elected
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:24.400]  what four times
[2:37:24.400 --> 2:37:27.280]  despite the fact that he kept making the situation worse
[2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:29.680]  because he got the voters so fearful
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:31.840]  that the only thing standing between them
[2:37:31.840 --> 2:37:35.280]  in starvation was rusev out in the big government
[2:37:35.280 --> 2:37:39.040]  and so the worst they can make the economy and the more dependent we think
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:40.480]  we are on government
[2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:42.640]  the the less likely we are to throw them out
[2:37:42.640 --> 2:37:45.280]  it's like you're you know they're the slaves and they they're the masters
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:48.960]  and they make the slaves think that we're dependent on them
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:53.200]  so it is a very dangerous time to be an american because they are going to
[2:37:53.200 --> 2:37:55.280]  seize a lot of control and a lot of power
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:57.920]  and we're going to lose a lot of individual liberties that we may never
[2:37:57.920 --> 2:37:59.440]  get back in our economy
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:01.360]  is going to continue to move away
[2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:04.720]  from a market-based economy to essentially planned economy
[2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:09.520]  and economic decisions and resources are going to be allocated and invested
[2:38:09.520 --> 2:38:13.520]  not based on individual entrepreneurs seeking profits
[2:38:13.520 --> 2:38:17.760]  but politicians seeking votes and this is not how to have a vibrant efficient
[2:38:17.760 --> 2:38:19.760]  economy where living standards grow
[2:38:19.760 --> 2:38:22.160]  this is the recipe for disaster
[2:38:22.160 --> 2:38:25.840]  yep this has not been the free market or american way
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:29.040]  and that brings me specifically to the fact they blame this on the free market
[2:38:29.040 --> 2:38:32.160]  they say the free market did this and then gordon brown and
[2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:34.560]  rock obama come out and say we have to merge
[2:38:35.440 --> 2:38:37.920]  the free market with government socialism
[2:38:37.920 --> 2:38:40.720]  with more regulation when they didn't even follow their own
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:44.640]  regulations and when the government paid corporations tax incentives
[2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:45.760]  to move offshore
[2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:50.640]  so i mean all of this being set up and now they come in
[2:38:50.640 --> 2:38:51.840]  to the rescue
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:53.840]  for a problem they engineered to begin with
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:38:58.160]  yeah it's always you know the free market always takes to blame
[2:38:58.160 --> 2:39:01.760]  when when you introduce government into the market
[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:06.800]  and then there's a problem it's always the cap capitalism that gets the blame
[2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:09.840]  but it's not capitalism it's the government mixed in
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:11.920]  it's the mixture of socialism and capitalism
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:14.960]  capitalism doesn't work when government interferes
[2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:19.280]  i mean there are a lot of natural forces that make capitalism work
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:22.880]  but the government comes in and gets in the way of those forces
[2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:24.640]  it circumvents them
[2:39:24.640 --> 2:39:29.040]  and it leads to the excess of risk-taking the excess of leverage
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:30.880]  that never would have come into existence
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:33.760]  but it were not for government intervention
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:36.640]  and of course they they come into the market and they subsidize
[2:39:36.640 --> 2:39:38.560]  something and they tax something else
[2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:42.240]  so they they interfere with rational decision-making
[2:39:42.240 --> 2:39:46.000]  and they they micromanage and they and they cause
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:47.920]  businesses and individuals to do things
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:51.440]  that absent government regulation they wouldn't have done
[2:39:51.440 --> 2:39:55.200]  uh... and and so they blow up all these bubbles and then the bubbles burst
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:56.720]  and then when we have a problem
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:39:59.520]  they say how you see you see it because the capitalism when
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:01.520]  if it was really a capitalist economy
[2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:04.560]  we never would have the bubbles and so we know they would never have to burst
[2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:08.000]  peter i specifically want you to speak to obama though
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:09.200]  uh...
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:11.760]  i mean what was it like for you to watch him
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:16.240]  on television helping ram through the banker takeover bill that gave him all
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:19.200]  these trillions and anonymity and secrecy
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:22.320]  and then months later they're saying we've got to have another bailout now
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:24.400]  and he's on tv criticizing
[2:40:24.400 --> 2:40:27.840]  the bankers and brokerage firms for giving themselves record bonuses
[2:40:27.840 --> 2:40:28.960]  i mean how stupid
[2:40:28.960 --> 2:40:32.560]  does he think the public is like it's like what what did they think
[2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:34.880]  uh... they were going to do with that money
[2:40:35.760 --> 2:40:38.320]  right i mean what did they think they were going to do with it i mean you know
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:41.120]  they they gave him a bunch of money they didn't think they were going to pay
[2:40:41.120 --> 2:40:41.840]  themselves
[2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:42.080]  you know
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:44.640]  i mean that i mean that's how these guys work
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:51.200]  yeah so it's amazing that you know it's like you know it's you know you're you're playing with you know
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:56.080]  with a snake and the snake bites you and you're surprised you know but more than that
[2:40:56.080 --> 2:40:57.200]  but more than that
[2:40:57.200 --> 2:40:58.000]  obama got
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:03.120]  depending on which index you look at obama got four times the wall street money
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:08.880]  that john mccain got uh... in campaign donations his cabinet is filled with the very group that
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:13.280]  engineered under clinton the changes that we now see coming to fruition
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:15.840]  i mean can you speak to that to have him claiming
[2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:19.840]  he's against the banking establishment and the brokerage firms and derivatives people
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:21.280]  when he really is their man
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:26.880]  yeah well it doesn't help politicians are that's politics you know that's the you know and and
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:27.920]  unfortunately
[2:41:27.920 --> 2:41:31.440]  you know uh... the the the economic problems that were
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:36.800]  our consequence of bad government policy mainly the federal reserve i mean look at all the new
[2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:41.520]  powers that the federal reserve has now specifically because of the problems that they helped create
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:45.760]  you know it's like you know all we do is we we know we turn over the the the the keys of the
[2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:47.760]  asylum to the inmates and that's what's going on
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:52.400]  you made a point earlier but i'd like you to expand on that and then we're gonna take some
[2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:59.120]  phone calls that they love what's happening uh... that the fact that the crisis is deepening
[2:41:59.120 --> 2:42:02.240]  allows them to expand their powers flesh that out a bit
[2:42:03.920 --> 2:42:07.600]  well i mean this is what what happens with government i mean government you know that
[2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:13.120]  they're very they can grow when there's a crisis or an emergency i mean if you look at
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:18.240]  all throughout history all the additional powers that the government usurped over the years all
[2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:23.200]  the new taxes that they were able to pass it was always during some type of crisis some type of
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:28.000]  emergency in general it's a war you know and then the governments are generally able to
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:32.640]  do things in wartime that they can never do in peacetime because people don't oppose them because
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:37.360]  they always make it about the war and therefore anybody who opposes what they're doing uh...
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:40.320]  is a you know they try to make it out well they don't care i mean or
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:43.680]  you know if you look how could you oppose the taxes when there are people dying though you
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:47.040]  know in a war i mean at least you're not you know you're not uh... on the front
[2:42:47.040 --> 2:42:50.800]  uh... you can at least support the troops by paying more taxes and they and they appeal to
[2:42:50.800 --> 2:42:54.880]  your patriotism and so the government's allowed to usurp a lot of power and then of course when
[2:42:54.880 --> 2:43:00.560]  the war is end uh... they never give up the extra power the wartime powers are the wartime taxes
[2:43:00.560 --> 2:43:04.720]  uh... they just find uh... new ways to spend the money so once the war is over
[2:43:04.720 --> 2:43:07.680]  they don't have to spend the money on the military but they spend it on something else they don't
[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:09.360]  give it back you know
[2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:15.600]  Mr. Schiff was an economic terrorism uh... Mr. Schiff i see it as economic terrorism
[2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:20.480]  to have barack obama john mccain and others cheerleading around
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:24.800]  on television back in october of two thousand eight saying you've got to pass the banker
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:29.040]  takeover bailout bill or we're going to have a depression next week
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:32.960]  and then they passed the bill on friday bush signs it on saturday
[2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:38.240]  and the treasury secretary says now we're not using it to unclog the subprime mortgages and the
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:42.320]  derivatives that came out of it uh... we're not going to tell you what we're going to spend it for
[2:43:42.320 --> 2:43:48.240]  i mean now they're back terrorizing us again yeah i mean it was really it was really basically a
[2:43:48.240 --> 2:43:54.400]  bait and switch is is what it was you know the whole time and you know it well i criticize the
[2:43:54.400 --> 2:43:59.040]  plan when they first proposed it i said it wouldn't work uh... because it was impossible to buy these
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:03.360]  troubled assets because you have to overpay for them otherwise you would bankrupt all the entities
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:07.200]  you were trying to bail out so there is no way the government can make a profit on it but if you
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:11.680]  remember the way they sold it to us you know when it didn't pass and the dow Jones dropped
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:15.360]  about a thousand points i think it went from thirteen thousand to twelve thousand or something
[2:44:15.360 --> 2:44:20.400]  they said aha you see the dow collapse because we didn't pass it so now we need to pass it to
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:25.200]  help the stock market well they passed it and the dow is less than eight thousand right now
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:29.600]  so obviously they tried to convince us that we needed to pass that bill because we had to get
[2:44:29.600 --> 2:44:34.160]  the stock market to go back up but you know look where the stock market is now even though we have
[2:44:34.160 --> 2:44:39.040]  the bill and now they're claiming that the american people are on the hook for these
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:45.920]  trillions and trillions of dollars uh... in interest to the very banks that we loan the money to
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:50.320]  and then the banks the big international banks won't tell congress where the money is
[2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:58.480]  yes i mean look i mean there's no transparency here in the in in this process and the whole
[2:44:58.480 --> 2:45:04.160]  thing is it's corrupted i mean right now there's a big debate over executive pay and bonuses and
[2:45:04.160 --> 2:45:08.960]  you know can companies take government money and then pay big bonuses and you know this is a debate
[2:45:08.960 --> 2:45:12.960]  that we shouldn't even have because it shouldn't be an issue because none of these companies
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:16.960]  should have got any government money in the first place they've been allowed to go bankrupt
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:22.320]  but now we bail them out and now we have the government getting involved in the decision
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:27.040]  making you know first of pay now they're they're telling some of these companies i have to cancel
[2:45:27.040 --> 2:45:33.040]  some of these uh... sales conferences they had you know in in in in vegas or in in miami i mean
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:37.040]  but this is the beginning i mean the government is going to get involved in every aspect of
[2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:41.600]  running these companies it would have been better to let the companies go bankrupt and let these
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:46.400]  resources be reallocated in the private sector now we're entrenching them in the government
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:51.120]  sector where they're never going to be efficient let's expand on that uh... look what happened
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:55.760]  with fanny man freddy mac with quasi uh... government control and they say that's one of the big
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:45:59.520]  sources of all of this they're saying they're going to get bailouts to auto companies but then
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:05.360]  control even who they can sell a car to uh... so we see the entire economy basically being taken
[2:46:05.360 --> 2:46:10.720]  over uh... by government and then through extension crazy thing about it is they're saying look we
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:15.440]  want to put strings on the money that we give to foreign germers we want to tell them how to make
[2:46:15.440 --> 2:46:19.280]  cars that what we want we want them to make fuel efficient cars or something like that
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:25.920]  so somehow uh... washington dc these guys can't even you know make a profit running the post office
[2:46:25.920 --> 2:46:29.440]  you know that somehow we're going to put the people who are in charge of the post office
[2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:34.720]  in charge of the auto industry and somehow they're going to do a better job than the people
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:39.680]  who have been running in the past i mean come on give me a break the government doesn't have a
[2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:43.920]  clue what kind of cars people should make they don't even have to make a car to profit
[2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:48.320]  people's decisions that need to be made in the free market by entrepreneurs
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:51.440]  that that that that are that have a risk of losing money yes
[2:46:52.480 --> 2:46:56.080]  peter i want to go to calls here in the last ten fifteen minutes with you but before we do that
[2:46:56.080 --> 2:47:00.320]  briefly they know things are imploding they know they're collapsing and then as you said
[2:47:00.320 --> 2:47:04.000]  they're going to be able to consolidate of the power and actually use this crisis
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:09.600]  themselves at the expense of our civilization uh... it appears the twenty thousand troops
[2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:13.040]  that north com says they want to use against the american people the army war college
[2:47:13.040 --> 2:47:16.560]  saying they're getting ready to engage the american people
[2:47:16.560 --> 2:47:20.560]  these are amazing developments bills introduced to merge local police into
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:24.400]  fema centers and fema camps for mass relocation
[2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:28.880]  uh... i mean this is the stuff of conspiracy theory but it's now front page news
[2:47:28.880 --> 2:47:32.960]  wall street journal came out last week and said the answer to the imploding economy
[2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:36.400]  is a new bubble into a north american union in a marrow
[2:47:36.400 --> 2:47:38.560]  so your take on that
[2:47:38.560 --> 2:47:43.120]  but i mean i i don't think that can happen i mean who knows i mean i think there's a lot of rumors
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:47.600]  there and you know conspiracy theory but i don't think the canadian would be stupid enough to go
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:48.480]  for it
[2:47:48.480 --> 2:47:52.480]  uh... and i don't think the canadian citizens would go for it i mean there's a lot of resentment
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:55.760]  of the u.s. so number one i don't think that i was going to do it so
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:47:59.520]  uh... you know i don't know that we're gonna have a union with mexico i mean i just don't
[2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:04.400]  you know a union in the u.s. can you know coming together with mexico i i don't know
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:08.480]  it just that that doesn't i don't even think that that's uh... that's in the cars
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:12.320]  well they're now proposing i think i think there's more there's more of a chance
[2:48:12.320 --> 2:48:16.560]  of our union breaking up i mean i think over the next five to ten years
[2:48:16.560 --> 2:48:20.000]  you might see uh... some states alaska
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:23.680]  texas of various states that trying to break away
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:28.080]  from the united states and leave i think i think it's more likely that the union we
[2:48:28.080 --> 2:48:32.560]  have now gets smaller and that we include the other country
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:36.000]  oh absolutely there's a lot of government reports saying that uh... that the united
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:37.680]  states may break up into pieces
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:41.200]  we're so globalist love that will just snap up the uh... pieces that are left
[2:48:41.200 --> 2:48:47.520]  kary in georgia you're on the air with peter schiff of europe a civic capital
[2:48:47.520 --> 2:48:50.000]  go ahead kary if you want to talk
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.880]  prison planet dot tv for three years
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:57.040]  and i just i'd love your work my question for mr schiff
[2:48:57.040 --> 2:48:58.240]  uh...
[2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:03.680]  i've seen uh... i've noticed that there's been a lot of foreclosed homes in my area
[2:49:03.680 --> 2:49:08.400]  and uh... that they're you know now selling for a third of half of the value
[2:49:08.400 --> 2:49:12.720]  and i'm wondering what uh... you know i've been making an extra two and a half
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:16.880]  payments a year on my mortgage and i've gotten a lot of equity built up and i'm
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:21.280]  wondering what's happening to the equity that is built up in my home
[2:49:21.280 --> 2:49:24.480]  well i don't know i mean whether the equity is there or not i mean just
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:26.880]  because you're paying down your mortgage doesn't necessarily mean you're
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:29.440]  building equity i don't know what you pay for your house
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:32.080]  and i don't know what you can sell it for i mean your house
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:35.280]  you know you could have negative equity in your home despite the fact that you
[2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:38.720]  have been making all these extra payments it all depends on what you pay for
[2:49:38.720 --> 2:49:41.840]  your home and how much you bought for you might have overpaid for it i i don't
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:43.840]  know yeah let me listen what did you
[2:49:43.840 --> 2:49:47.520]  let me give listeners a tip and then in peter continue uh... people are going
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:51.520]  to the bank and making them renegotiate the value of the home
[2:49:51.520 --> 2:49:55.680]  uh... or they're threatening to walk away and banks are buckling peter
[2:49:55.680 --> 2:49:59.680]  yeah look you know that the borrower has all the cards particularly the borrower
[2:49:59.680 --> 2:50:02.400]  with uh... little or no equity in their homes
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:05.680]  uh... you know you can simply go to your bank and and say
[2:50:05.680 --> 2:50:09.440]  look if you want me to keep making the mortgage payment you better renegotiate
[2:50:09.440 --> 2:50:13.040]  the mortgage and the key is in the past you really
[2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:16.560]  couldn't do that because if they renegotiate the mortgage
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:20.560]  the difference between what you used to owe and what you did what you owe now
[2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:23.360]  would have been taxable income and you would add a big tax bill
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:28.000]  but the government uh... you know put a put a stop to that for five years or so
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:32.080]  so americans have a window of opportunity where there's no downside
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:35.440]  uh... to threatening uh... your your lender because
[2:50:35.440 --> 2:50:39.600]  you know you can get a lower mortgage worst-case scenario you just walk away
[2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:42.720]  you know just give the house the lender which is what they don't want but you
[2:50:42.720 --> 2:50:46.640]  can give them an asset that has negative value and there's plenty of houses on
[2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:49.680]  the market to rent i mean most people would be better off
[2:50:49.680 --> 2:50:52.640]  renting anyway chances are you can find a home
[2:50:52.640 --> 2:50:56.720]  that's as nice or nicer than the one you live in now where the rent is lower than
[2:50:56.720 --> 2:51:02.160]  your mortgage all right stay there peter final segment work all straight ahead

[2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:42.960]  briefly good case scenario how bad is it going to
[2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:47.680]  get worst case scenario how bad will it get just summed up
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:51.360]  well worst case scenario was really bad i mean i you know hyperinflation
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:55.120]  uh our money being worthless uh you know
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:58.800]  that's bad i mean you know i mean look what happened in in in germany
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:02.080]  well why my republic germany when they had hyperinflation we ended up with a
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:05.280]  little hitler you know i mean i don't think it's going to be i mean i don't
[2:55:05.280 --> 2:55:07.680]  think it could be that bad but it just shows you
[2:55:07.680 --> 2:55:11.680]  that you know bad things can happen when you when you get a country that's in
[2:55:11.680 --> 2:55:16.000]  that bad a shape i mean the the the environment the economic environment
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:18.880]  that allowed someone like a hitler to come to power
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:23.200]  uh we did it he never could have come to power if uh he they didn't have that
[2:55:23.200 --> 2:55:28.000]  economic situation here's the who knows the people there's a lot of danger to
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:31.520]  our liberties to our way of life based on how bad this
[2:55:31.520 --> 2:55:35.920]  things could get best case scenario best case scenario would be
[2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:39.360]  the government comes to its senses at some point they realize
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:42.480]  that the stimulus and bailouts are making the situation worse
[2:55:42.480 --> 2:55:46.560]  we reverse course we cut government spending we increase interest rates
[2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:50.320]  and we let the chips fall where they may we suck it up and we suffer a very
[2:55:50.320 --> 2:55:54.320]  severe economic downturn uh you know we stop buying stuff
[2:55:54.320 --> 2:55:57.840]  and that we roll up our sleeves and go back to work and rebuild the viable
[2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:01.920]  economy uh recapture our our role in the world and
[2:56:01.920 --> 2:56:05.920]  and and make a a country that our children can be proud of and be
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:08.960]  prosperous and i mean i mean it's not a it's not a complete
[2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:13.120]  lost cause yet i mean we can talk but there's no there's no way to get from
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:16.560]  where we are now to where we want to be without going through a lot of pain
[2:56:16.560 --> 2:56:19.280]  we can go through more pain if we do it the government's way
[2:56:19.280 --> 2:56:22.640]  or we can get to go through less pain if we do it the free market way
[2:56:22.640 --> 2:56:26.880]  and obama's says he's going the government way
[2:56:26.880 --> 2:56:29.440]  oh yeah because that's the only way that they see they speak
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:33.200]  to see obama's out making speeches he's saying that unless we act
[2:56:33.200 --> 2:56:36.480]  it's going to get a lot worse you know it's going to get a lot worse whether
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:40.320]  we act or not it's just that if we do act it's going to get even worse
[2:56:40.320 --> 2:56:44.240]  than if we don't act well we saw that back in october they passed the bank or
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:48.160]  take over look what happened uh let's talk to uh
[2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:52.880]  michael and mass you're on the air with our guests go ahead
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:56.480]  peter alex has it going today guys good we got about a minute and a half
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:57:01.120]  i don't want to say something real quick it in order for people to stop
[2:57:01.120 --> 2:57:05.040]  listening to the you know the davos folks the bill de berger
[2:57:05.040 --> 2:57:08.640]  folks you know the people who set us up to fail and then try to act like our
[2:57:08.640 --> 2:57:12.640]  savers it seems to me that in order for people to turn away from them
[2:57:12.640 --> 2:57:16.560]  those people have to come into a certain degree of ridicule
[2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:20.400]  it need to be you know kind of a dethroned in the eyes of the public
[2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:25.360]  and you know i had a i had an idea for a peter and i know he's a he's a big
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:29.040]  friend of ron paul when ron paul's in front of the house banking
[2:57:29.040 --> 2:57:32.640]  committee with bernanke why doesn't he just say
[2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:36.080]  hey ben what are you guys doing at the bill de berger group
[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:39.600]  before anything else you know happens and you give away any more money and i
[2:57:39.600 --> 2:57:43.920]  and i video tape jim i video tape him going in there setting policy
[2:57:43.920 --> 2:57:47.760]  uh... last year yeah yeah what about calling for criminal charges for the
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:50.560]  rules that have been broken the laws that have been broken all the insider
[2:57:50.560 --> 2:57:52.240]  trading all the corruption peter
[2:57:52.240 --> 2:57:54.400]  and we should be talking about the people being in trouble
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:58.400]  uh... instead of them posing as the saviors peter
[2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:02.000]  yeah look i mean we need to confront the fact about a lot of things that they've
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:05.040]  done wrong but unfortunately they're there they've been given even greater
[2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:08.800]  power and now the federal reserve works in conjunction with the treasury so
[2:58:08.800 --> 2:58:11.280]  instead of having an independent central bank
[2:58:11.280 --> 2:58:14.400]  uh... the central bank is totally captured by the politicians
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:17.600]  uh... they work you know hand-in-hand with the treasury department
[2:58:17.600 --> 2:58:21.040]  and you know the whole idea behind the fed was that it was going to be
[2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:25.120]  independent uh... to uh... to keep the politicians in check
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:28.480]  and now they're able to run a lot because the the federal reserve is
[2:58:28.480 --> 2:58:31.600]  is basically uh... you know go along with the ride
[2:58:31.600 --> 2:58:34.640]  all right peter schiff we really appreciate you spending time with us take

[3:00:37.600 --> 3:00:41.200]  let's go ahead and go to ted anderson with an update on what's happening in the
[3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:45.200]  golden silver market minus resources
[3:00:45.200 --> 3:00:49.760]  ted 30 years in the golden silver business again he still has gold he bought
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:53.360]  back from gold was 838 35 but it is almost all
[3:00:53.360 --> 3:00:57.600]  gone well up right up there at $910 an ounce
[3:00:57.600 --> 3:01:01.520]  uh today and folks don't wait till the economy
[3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:04.240]  implodes don't wait till everything completely falls apart in the paper
[3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:08.000]  money can't buy silver and gold move some of your assets today in the
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:11.440]  golden silver and i can't find a better place or a better deal on physical
[3:01:11.440 --> 3:01:16.720]  holding of gold and silver ted tell folks about today's offer
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:21.360]  yeah i sure will um well what we have going on right now is i do have like
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:25.120]  you said i have some of those francs and some of those sovereigns left at that
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:28.560]  830 level um interestingly enough we did have a
[3:01:28.560 --> 3:01:33.040]  little dip down there below 900 and i was able to pick up pick up some
[3:01:33.040 --> 3:01:36.560]  maple leaves and eagles and that kind of thing uh there's a new coin that's
[3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:38.960]  coming out of the u.s. mint that's a replica
[3:01:38.960 --> 3:01:42.480]  of the $20 st god and it's a high relief coin beautiful i'm hoping to get a
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:46.640]  bunch of those uh but right now at this particular time i mean
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:50.640]  just watching it dips back and boom it just forwards back up again
[3:01:50.640 --> 3:01:53.920]  and uh the phones are ringing people want the gold right now and i would
[3:01:53.920 --> 3:01:58.320]  suggest that everybody get in on it uh there just isn't enough uh good news
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:01.760]  out there in the economy that would force gold to drop
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:06.960]  you know significantly down anymore everything is up and so uh yeah right now
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:10.720]  if you want to get on something get in on something that is uh underpriced and
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:14.560]  at a good value at this time those franc smaller gold pieces there are
[3:02:14.560 --> 3:02:16.400]  a fifth of an ounce of gold they're a hundred
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:21.920]  they're they're sitting at 217 and the british sovereign is at 265
[3:02:21.920 --> 3:02:25.680]  uh going into the marketplace now that gold is at 910
[3:02:25.680 --> 3:02:30.400]  uh there's the same coins the the the frank right now would be at 228
[3:02:30.400 --> 3:02:36.160]  british sovereigns would be at 279 uh silver is just a a
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:41.600]  fantastic buy at this time uh people and by the way ted it is in the news
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:45.120]  that most places are sold out or they have anything there's huge premiums
[3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:48.320]  people are getting this under the regular price it
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:51.680]  instead of just with a premium or no premium i mean
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:54.800]  you're doing this because you've got so many connections around the world
[3:02:54.800 --> 3:02:57.680]  that other people don't have folks you're not going to find deals like this
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:04.560]  anywhere else 800 686 2237 800 686 2237
[3:03:04.560 --> 3:03:08.000]  yeah all i can say about it alex right now is that there's times when i but
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:11.440]  when i buy this stuff and the gold and silver bumps up i mean you can't even
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:15.760]  find this stuff at garage sale prices on ebay for what i'm selling it for
[3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:19.200]  and the and the reason why that is is because every time i see a dip
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:22.720]  i'm a buyer and i and i just trust in the fact that
[3:03:22.720 --> 3:03:26.320]  the united states government is going to screw things up even worse
[3:03:26.320 --> 3:03:30.320]  and push the prices even higher i'm not afraid to take on inventory
[3:03:30.320 --> 3:03:33.600]  with that type of circumstance going on i don't think the people that are
[3:03:33.600 --> 3:03:36.320]  listening to the show should be afraid of that either
[3:03:36.320 --> 3:03:40.400]  now is the time to be getting into gold and silver when the horns and the sirens
[3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:43.200]  and the you know the air raid sirens are going off
[3:03:43.200 --> 3:03:47.280]  and and everything is just pointing at the fact that the united states dollars
[3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:50.640]  in trouble that the united states economy is even in worse trouble
[3:03:50.640 --> 3:03:55.600]  and the politicians think that spending money and building golf courses and
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:04:00.480]  and uh and and marinas and and god knows what else i mean look i mean let's
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:03.680]  let's just start paying for every woman that needs to have an abortion or
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:06.160]  wants to have an abortion right now i should say
[3:04:06.160 --> 3:04:08.960]  you know i mean that's the kind of crap that they're trying to feed down our
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:12.720]  throat they want to buy new cars for each senator green cars
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:15.200]  oh they're going to make the whole capital green now
[3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:19.520]  oh my god this is not going to solve our economic problems
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:22.640]  you don't solve your economic problems by spending more money
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:26.640]  that's not how you do it you tighten your belt you you know you and you do

[3:08:23.280 --> 3:08:26.880]  enterprise institutes program on financial markets deregulation wallison
[3:08:26.880 --> 3:08:30.240]  studies banking insurance and the wall street regulation as general counsel of
[3:08:30.240 --> 3:08:33.600]  the u.s treasury department he had a significant role in the development of

[3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:40.080]  services industry he was also general counsel of the

[3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:03.920]  enterprise institute for public policy research
[3:09:03.920 --> 3:09:07.680]  what in the world from your perspective is going on right now
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:12.560]  and which direction in your opinion is washington going and is that in the
[3:09:12.560 --> 3:09:14.320]  right direction
[3:09:14.320 --> 3:09:19.040]  uh... well it depends on the area we are talking about uh... i think the
[3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:22.720]  stimulus package looks like it is going in the right direction because the
[3:09:22.720 --> 3:09:24.000]  republicans
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:28.480]  are finally beginning to influence uh... things in the senate uh... they
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:33.680]  obviously lost out completely in the house but uh... it was nice to see that
[3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:36.880]  all the republicans stuck together and voted against what came out of the
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:39.200]  house which was simply a pork barrel bill
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:42.800]  uh... the usual democratic pork barrel and
[3:09:42.800 --> 3:09:46.000]  i think the latest polls indicate the american people
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:48.480]  have recognized it as such
[3:09:48.480 --> 3:09:53.200]  uh... so things are looking a little bit better on the stimulus side i'd say
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:55.600]  from obama's point of view
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:00.400]  things are really falling apart because uh... what happened to him
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:05.280]  shouldn't happen to a person who had any kind of sophistication in washington
[3:10:05.280 --> 3:10:09.360]  um... and uh... i don't know where his advisers were on this but he allowed the
[3:10:09.360 --> 3:10:12.960]  house of representatives to shape his stimulus bill
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:17.280]  and he then had to go out and tell the american people things that weren't
[3:10:17.280 --> 3:10:22.240]  true this is not good for this for the way to start your administration
[3:10:22.240 --> 3:10:25.280]  you shouldn't go out and lie to the american people about what one of your
[3:10:25.280 --> 3:10:28.000]  latest one of what you one of what your
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  policies is going to do they figure it out very quickly
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:37.040]  so now the senate has gotten hold of it there is a lot of debate going on there
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:38.880]  it looks like there will be some
[3:10:38.880 --> 3:10:42.160]  some changes to make it much more tax friendly
[3:10:42.160 --> 3:10:45.040]  more republican taxes going into it
[3:10:45.040 --> 3:10:50.400]  uh... fewer um... pork barrel projects that came out of the house
[3:10:50.400 --> 3:10:54.080]  obama will take a big whipping on this one
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:59.040]  and uh... maybe he will have learned a lesson but this is almost irretrievable
[3:10:59.040 --> 3:11:02.880]  you know the old expression and that is that uh... you never have a second
[3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:04.880]  chance to make a first impression
[3:11:04.880 --> 3:11:09.440]  and uh... what the american people are seeing now in obama is a completely
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:10.240]  different
[3:11:10.240 --> 3:11:13.840]  uh... view than what they had seen during the campaign
[3:11:13.840 --> 3:11:17.680]  or you never get a fourth chance to make a third impression
[3:11:17.680 --> 3:11:21.120]  uh... i mean i don't see this is his first big blowout
[3:11:21.120 --> 3:11:25.360]  almost all of his cabinet or sub-cabinet positions haven't paid their taxes
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:28.160]  entirely or partially and are having to
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:30.880]  uh... resign in droves before they're ever even
[3:11:30.880 --> 3:11:34.800]  uh... confirmed i would call that the first big disaster
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:38.560]  and then now people are finding out that millions of dollars in austin texas
[3:11:38.560 --> 3:11:43.280]  where i live for frisbee golf hundreds of millions for a river boardwalk
[3:11:43.280 --> 3:11:46.240]  uh... tens of millions for a golf course expansion
[3:11:46.240 --> 3:11:49.360]  uh... yacht clubs uh... hollywood producer
[3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:53.360]  uh... money uh... i mean this is the worst pork barrel i've ever seen
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:56.720]  yeah it's pretty bad it's pretty bad and uh...
[3:11:56.720 --> 3:12:02.560]  that it's it's uh... look for a for me for other republicans it is
[3:12:02.560 --> 3:12:06.320]  kind of humorous to see this happen but
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:10.800]  uh... on the other hand i mean we only have one president
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:14.720]  and uh... i do get a little bit worried that he he um...
[3:12:14.720 --> 3:12:19.440]  is is losing control of the situation if we were not
[3:12:19.440 --> 3:12:23.760]  in if we were not in such bad economic
[3:12:23.760 --> 3:12:28.320]  straits right now if things were not uh... really desperate
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:32.640]  in terms of the economy then i wouldn't care one way the other but um...
[3:12:32.640 --> 3:12:36.880]  unfortunately uh... we have to have someone who speaks with one voice for
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:39.840]  the american government and uh... he's
[3:12:39.840 --> 3:12:43.760]  he's quickly losing his political capital to get the american people to
[3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:44.880]  believe him
[3:12:44.880 --> 3:12:48.640]  well he got worried as he's a great actor and a great performer
[3:12:48.640 --> 3:12:53.040]  and he did what he was told in the senate but now those instincts to say yes
[3:12:53.040 --> 3:12:55.920]  yes yes to everybody those are the same instincts that
[3:12:55.920 --> 3:12:59.520]  made george bush triple the size of government uh... with the democrats
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:02.080]  and destroyed his presidency and it looks like obama
[3:13:02.080 --> 3:13:05.360]  is looking to top that uh... can you speak to that specifically and then
[3:13:05.360 --> 3:13:09.920]  i'll give us your political take on uh... most of the people he's
[3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:12.640]  trying to get the cabinet having to step down
[3:13:12.640 --> 3:13:13.600]  um... well
[3:13:13.600 --> 3:13:18.160]  uh... yeah let me just talk about the spending the spending is going to be
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:21.040]  it's going to be terrible if if obama
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:24.640]  allows himself to be taken for a ride again
[3:13:24.640 --> 3:13:28.240]  by the democrats in congress he's got to make a choice now i mean he
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:32.880]  he has he has got to show the american people who are quite concerned about
[3:13:32.880 --> 3:13:33.840]  spending
[3:13:33.840 --> 3:13:38.560]  uh... that that he's got a handle on this thing and he's nobody's tool
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:43.280]  what what happened to him on the on the uh... stimulus package is that the
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:44.480]  the
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:48.160]  that the policy and the democrats simply harness him to go out and tell the
[3:13:48.160 --> 3:13:50.240]  american people that what they had
[3:13:50.240 --> 3:13:52.080]  written up in this bill
[3:13:52.080 --> 3:13:54.400]  uh... was a stimulus package and that
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:55.120]  soon
[3:13:55.120 --> 3:13:58.720]  i got old i mean people recognize that that was not true
[3:13:58.720 --> 3:14:00.800]  so um...
[3:14:00.800 --> 3:14:05.200]  he's he's going to be in in in very very bad shape what
[3:14:05.200 --> 3:14:06.080]  however
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:06.800]  uh...
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:08.800]  is happening elsewhere
[3:14:08.800 --> 3:14:12.400]  in his administration is also troubling to him as you
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:15.440]  suggest i mean it it isn't actually
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:19.440]  all his appointees or even a majority of appointees but some very
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:20.720]  important ones
[3:14:20.720 --> 3:14:23.040]  didn't pay their taxes
[3:14:23.040 --> 3:14:26.800]  um... geithner who was tim geithner who was the nominee for
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:28.400]  secretary of the treasury
[3:14:28.400 --> 3:14:33.360]  got through despite the fact that he had quite clearly
[3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:36.000]  um... ignored his tax obligations
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:40.080]  that is a remarkable thing that uh... could happen because when i was at the
[3:14:40.080 --> 3:14:41.520]  treasury department
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:45.360]  if there was a hinted at the slightest hint
[3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:50.400]  uh... that a person had not met his tax obligations
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:14:54.560]  before he applied to have a job of any kind i don't care where you're whether
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:14:55.760]  you're talking about
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:14:57.280]  clipping hedges
[3:14:57.280 --> 3:15:02.000]  or you're talking about uh... uh... uh... assistant secretary's job
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:05.360]  uh... if you hadn't observed your tax obligations
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:06.320]  you were out
[3:15:06.320 --> 3:15:09.040]  you never even got for an interview
[3:15:09.040 --> 3:15:12.400]  uh... and here we have the secretary of the treasury
[3:15:12.400 --> 3:15:16.720]  uh... who has set a very very bad example he's he's lost whatever moral
[3:15:16.720 --> 3:15:20.160]  authority might have had well going back to be specific it's quite a few of the
[3:15:20.160 --> 3:15:22.480]  cabinet sub cabinet people that have made taxes
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:25.040]  you're right it's not that you know all of them are the majority was a large
[3:15:25.040 --> 3:15:26.320]  portion of prominent ones
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:30.560]  i was kind of mixing in there other people having a step down like uh...
[3:15:30.560 --> 3:15:34.320]  new mexico governor bill richardson for you know all these bizarre payments from
[3:15:34.320 --> 3:15:36.240]  lobbyists and then him getting them big
[3:15:36.240 --> 3:15:39.360]  so i mean it's just uh... and then you got blagojevic tied to him
[3:15:39.360 --> 3:15:42.640]  got ramen manuel tied into all this i mean this looks like
[3:15:42.640 --> 3:15:47.440]  chicago big city machine on steroids now inhabiting dc
[3:15:47.440 --> 3:15:50.160]  yeah now it's not good it's not good
[3:15:50.160 --> 3:15:55.920]  um... and uh... he's he's got to get control of this thing and uh...
[3:15:55.920 --> 3:15:59.920]  and show the american people that he's actually trying to have an
[3:15:59.920 --> 3:16:02.640]  administration of the kind he talked about
[3:16:02.640 --> 3:16:04.640]  and that that he hasn't fooled them
[3:16:04.640 --> 3:16:07.280]  um... this is what happened to bill clinton
[3:16:07.280 --> 3:16:11.680]  um... and uh... you remember that clinton became exceedingly popular
[3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:15.440]  unpopular right after he became president and why was that
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:19.120]  and that is because although he campaigned as a moderate he campaigned
[3:16:19.120 --> 3:16:22.880]  as a as a democrat who was more conservative than most in a
[3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:27.280]  a free trader and so forth and the first thing he did when he came in
[3:16:27.280 --> 3:16:31.920]  was uh... gays in the military and uh...
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:35.200]  the american people turn to one another and they said uh... oh
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:38.000]  the republicans were right this guy's a liberal
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:43.040]  um... and they he no longer had any credibility with the american people
[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:46.800]  that's why so many of his other initiative failed
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:52.080]  um... and that the real danger here for uh... obama is that he will be
[3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:54.400]  perceived the same way in which case
[3:16:54.400 --> 3:17:00.000]  uh... we will have four years of of uh... lack of leadership and this is not
[3:17:00.000 --> 3:17:00.880]  a time
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:04.240]  all right um... when we should uh... be having a lack of leadership
[3:17:04.240 --> 3:17:07.200]  on the time we've got left with you and we're talking to the former white house
[3:17:07.200 --> 3:17:10.320]  council uh... chief counsel to president reagan also
[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:13.120]  uh... head council the treasury department separately over the american
[3:17:13.120 --> 3:17:15.440]  enterprise institute peter j wallison
[3:17:15.440 --> 3:17:18.800]  and he's written quite a few books the latest one the competitive uh... equity
[3:17:18.800 --> 3:17:21.840]  a better way to organize mutual funds
[3:17:21.840 --> 3:17:26.120]  put out by a i press sir i also wrote a book about reagan
[3:17:26.120 --> 3:17:28.320]  it's on that list but uh...
[3:17:28.320 --> 3:17:33.040]  and if you're if you're if you're uh... listeners are interested in that they
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:36.320]  should be able to find that on amazon absolutely
[3:17:36.320 --> 3:17:40.480]  uh... now specifically with the mail out you've been criticizing
[3:17:40.480 --> 3:17:44.800]  uh... the way some of its being carried out
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:48.240]  well uh... i am i am of the view uh... that
[3:17:48.240 --> 3:17:52.560]  uh... the only way we're gonna be able to get the banks to start lending again
[3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:57.760]  is if the banks uh... have more confidence in their own
[3:17:57.760 --> 3:18:00.320]  capital in their own assets
[3:18:00.320 --> 3:18:04.960]  uh... and right now they don't and they can't because their assets
[3:18:04.960 --> 3:18:10.080]  are largely mortgages uh... mortgage-backed securities that
[3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:14.640]  uh... uh... that were uh... that are bad quality
[3:18:14.640 --> 3:18:20.880]  uh... and and and whole mortgages of various kinds now when that is true
[3:18:20.880 --> 3:18:25.120]  and the more and the housing market is continuing to fall than these mortgages
[3:18:25.120 --> 3:18:29.040]  begin to default and uh... when they default the banks
[3:18:29.040 --> 3:18:33.760]  uh... have much less value there as a result they all are hoarding
[3:18:33.760 --> 3:18:36.800]  as much in the way of dollars as they can
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:40.880]  uh... so that if their depositors or their counterparties come in and ask
[3:18:40.880 --> 3:18:42.000]  for their money
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:45.520]  uh... the banks can pay them off otherwise they're afraid they will be
[3:18:45.520 --> 3:18:46.640]  closed
[3:18:46.640 --> 3:18:50.400]  uh... and and default so the only way
[3:18:50.400 --> 3:18:54.080]  i think to get the banks to start lending
[3:18:54.080 --> 3:18:58.400]  is to buy those bad assets off their balance sheets
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:03.520]  and hold them in in a bad bank or hold them in some other kind of account
[3:19:03.520 --> 3:19:08.960]  uh... and a substitute cash for those assets in that case
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:12.400]  the banks will be much healthier they will look healthier to
[3:19:12.400 --> 3:19:16.400]  depositors and counterparties they will feel comfortable beginning to lend
[3:19:16.400 --> 3:19:20.240]  money uh... but that's the solution to our problems on the one side
[3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:22.560]  okay well we've got a break we've got five more minutes with you after the
[3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:24.320]  break we come back and i want you to get into
[3:19:24.320 --> 3:19:28.320]  on the other side what's uh... what's uh... really happening instead of what
[3:19:28.320 --> 3:19:29.920]  you're seeing should happen
[3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:31.120]  uh...
[3:19:31.120 --> 3:19:33.240]  and i want to ask you when we come back
[3:19:33.240 --> 3:19:36.480]  what's going on here they talk about trillions of dollars nine hundred fifty
[3:19:36.480 --> 3:19:37.600]  billion
[3:19:37.600 --> 3:19:40.320]  and the federal reserve gets up before congress and says we're not going to say
[3:19:40.320 --> 3:19:41.840]  where it is
[3:19:41.840 --> 3:19:45.200]  uh... because the banks are being completely secretive
[3:19:45.200 --> 3:19:47.600]  because they're in some such
[3:19:47.600 --> 3:19:50.160]  you know serious financial disarray
[3:19:50.160 --> 3:19:50.960]  so we'll
[3:19:50.960 --> 3:19:54.960]  get your expert opinion on former chief counsel treasurer and ronald reagan
[3:19:54.960 --> 3:19:57.960]  when we come back on the other side stay with us

[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:22.560]  power for six thousand years if you had had $100,000 in cash and
[3:22:22.560 --> 3:22:27.680]  $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now
[3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:31.840]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800

[3:24:13.280 --> 3:24:16.400]  peter j wallison is our guest we got about five minutes left with him and i'm
[3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:19.280]  going to get into a bunch of news your phone calls
[3:24:19.280 --> 3:24:23.200]  and a lot more in the last 30 minutes of the show today
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:28.400]  uh... mr. wallison uh... okay so you're seeing by the assets to get the banks
[3:24:28.400 --> 3:24:31.280]  going again instead they just give them money
[3:24:31.280 --> 3:24:34.240]  and then we're told no one can know where it's going or what they're doing
[3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:38.240]  with it then obama makes a thing about you know executive compensation and
[3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:42.160]  criticizes the bailout as if he wasn't the guy that helped ram it through
[3:24:42.160 --> 3:24:46.400]  uh... so what's really happening right now well i think the obama administration
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:50.080]  uh... is following exactly the wrong policy in trying to
[3:24:50.080 --> 3:24:52.640]  limit compensation i understand what they're doing it
[3:24:52.640 --> 3:24:57.600]  yes people are angry because uh... these people are paid so much but
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:01.040]  if you want the banks to be able to function
[3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:04.640]  um... you cannot punish the people who are now in charge of them the people who
[3:25:04.640 --> 3:25:06.240]  are now in charge of them
[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:09.200]  are not the people who caused them all this trouble
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:12.800]  uh... they're not the people who lost all this money other new people who have
[3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:16.080]  come along to try to help out and if you're gonna
[3:25:16.080 --> 3:25:20.240]  cut their salaries at when they're working 20 hours a day in it and having
[3:25:20.240 --> 3:25:23.920]  to leave their families for long periods of time it's not
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:28.640]  it's not going to attract many good people to those institutions and we
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:32.080]  need good people there now sir i'm not trying to be partisan because i'm not
[3:25:32.080 --> 3:25:35.600]  i'm a libertarian ron paul guy uh... my issue here
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:40.480]  is that and you can blame bush a lot for this it goes all the way back but but
[3:25:40.480 --> 3:25:44.240]  more than that it really was the clinton's who changed a lot of these rules
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:46.800]  and who allowed a lot of this stuff to happen and then
[3:25:46.800 --> 3:25:51.520]  uh... they run around uh... you know then putting their finger but but
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:54.880]  that's a side issue while we have you here you were white house counsel ron
[3:25:54.880 --> 3:25:58.160]  ronald reagan also i know you saw a lot of what went across his desk and and
[3:25:58.160 --> 3:26:01.840]  what happened and i have congressional testimony about rex eighty four and
[3:26:01.840 --> 3:26:03.040]  things like that
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:06.880]  that's all that's you know uh... mainly secret now they're openly announcing
[3:26:06.880 --> 3:26:08.240]  things like this with
[3:26:08.240 --> 3:26:12.800]  the bills for fema camps for to relocate americans during collapse of society
[3:26:12.800 --> 3:26:15.600]  continuity of government it appears the federal government
[3:26:15.600 --> 3:26:20.240]  thinks we're going to go into a depression is gearing up for collapse
[3:26:20.240 --> 3:26:23.760]  uh... well i don't know anything about any of those things maybe they maybe
[3:26:23.760 --> 3:26:26.400]  they are happening but i haven't seen anything like that
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:31.520]  uh... and it is actually though possible that we could have a depression
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:35.040]  uh... that's why the government is acting in
[3:26:35.040 --> 3:26:38.160]  in such extraordinary ways why the federal wild if
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:41.000]  what the federal reserve is doing so much what the treasury department is
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:42.160]  spending so much
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:46.120]  trying to avoid the possibility of a recession because
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:47.520]  in the thirties
[3:26:47.520 --> 3:26:51.360]  uh... the diagnosis has been that uh... the reason we have this depression in
[3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:54.520]  the thirties was that the federal reserve did not act
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:26:58.400]  and the government did not act satisfactorily to keep uh... the economy
[3:26:58.400 --> 3:26:59.760]  from declining and keep
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:03.040]  to keep keeping them deflation from occurring
[3:27:03.040 --> 3:27:07.320]  so i think it i think what they're doing is necessary and i'm a conservative
[3:27:07.320 --> 3:27:10.720]  uh... but uh... i i i i don't
[3:27:10.720 --> 3:27:15.240]  understand that why the obama administration when it has chance to
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:18.200]  get things started again on a clean slate
[3:27:18.200 --> 3:27:23.000]  uh... would start now by punishing people on wall street who were not
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:25.520]  responsible for the losses
[3:27:25.520 --> 3:27:27.240]  mister wallison
[3:27:27.240 --> 3:27:30.280]  enclosing you've certainly heard about how they're putting combat brigades
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:32.560]  inside the u.s. i mean that's all over the news
[3:27:32.560 --> 3:27:35.320]  you haven't heard about that
[3:27:35.320 --> 3:27:37.720]  uh... have you heard about uh...
[3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:40.760]  but i don't mean it's not happening
[3:27:40.760 --> 3:27:44.760]  it's just that i'm not i'm not reading it in the newspapers that i read and i'm
[3:27:44.760 --> 3:27:48.360]  not reading about it in the newspapers are not hearing about it on the radio
[3:27:48.360 --> 3:27:51.800]  or seeing it on television did you see market watch last week when they called
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:53.240]  for a north american union
[3:27:53.240 --> 3:27:54.680]  to get us out of this crisis
[3:27:54.680 --> 3:27:57.760]  uh... now that wall street journal online
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:00.200]  now it didn't see that well i mean i mean there's millions of things i'm
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:03.280]  saying oh how dare you not know about i mean this some of the stuff's obscure
[3:28:03.280 --> 3:28:05.960]  you know my whole point is is that uh...
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:09.520]  the big government folks seem to like crises because then they get to play
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:10.280]  savior
[3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:11.600]  and expand their power
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:15.120]  there's some of that going on with obama yeah absolutely i think i think it
[3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:19.080]  is true that uh... for people who are in the government this is a great
[3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:22.000]  opportunity as you heard from a manual state
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:26.040]  it be a terrible thing to waste a good crisis and what they mean by that is
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:29.760]  they can especially the democrats can take over a much broader part of the
[3:28:29.760 --> 3:28:32.400]  economy through regulation and otherwise
[3:28:32.400 --> 3:28:34.320]  when there's a crisis
[3:28:34.320 --> 3:28:38.320]  i and many others in washington are trying very hard to make sure that
[3:28:38.320 --> 3:28:39.840]  that doesn't happen
[3:28:39.840 --> 3:28:42.520]  uh... but it's going to be a very tough
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:45.440]  uh... very tough fight because their people
[3:28:45.440 --> 3:28:49.520]  who for a long time have wanted to impose much more regulation and many more
[3:28:49.520 --> 3:28:50.560]  controls
[3:28:50.560 --> 3:28:54.360]  and this crisis gives them an opportunity to do it because the american
[3:28:54.360 --> 3:28:55.200]  people
[3:28:55.200 --> 3:28:56.840]  sometimes believe
[3:28:56.840 --> 3:29:01.520]  sometimes believe that uh... that's what has to be done in the case like this
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:04.120]  but uh... but we will
[3:29:04.120 --> 3:29:07.800]  we we will get out of this situation in a few years
[3:29:07.800 --> 3:29:10.080]  but if we impose new regulation
[3:29:10.080 --> 3:29:13.000]  uh... will that will be with us for fifty years
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:16.160]  and that will slow down the growth of our economy and make us a much
[3:29:16.160 --> 3:29:19.680]  different society so i'm i'm quite worried about that

[3:35:24.640 --> 3:35:29.680]  rampage through your calls Sean in Florida you're on the air welcome how you
[3:35:29.680 --> 3:35:34.920]  doing Alex doing pretty good what's on your mind I just had a couple unqualified
[3:35:34.920 --> 3:35:41.240]  thought-provoking ideas the first first one is you know we're talking about the
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:49.000]  worst-case scenario coins by the very nature have a fun to fundamental metal
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:53.960]  value although it's not you know the face value the coin but if we were because
[3:35:53.960 --> 3:35:58.120]  of scarcity it can be above or below the face value of the coin or depending on
[3:35:58.120 --> 3:36:02.600]  you know when you get into the market but as our currency devaluates it might
[3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:06.920]  not be unwise to add more coinage into the currency even though it is
[3:36:06.920 --> 3:36:11.400]  inconvenient and more cumbersome than paper because that model will have an
[3:36:11.400 --> 3:36:15.040]  inherent value of no that's the whole about what type of monetary system we
[3:36:15.040 --> 3:36:21.120]  should have sure but you know another another another thing that I thought
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:26.640]  recently is up as Ron Paul is always advocated introducing a competing
[3:36:26.640 --> 3:36:31.400]  currency yes I'll reserve note yes you know there's such a certainly some
[3:36:31.400 --> 3:36:35.880]  interesting court cases where you know the the Supreme Court upheld the 16th
[3:36:35.880 --> 3:36:44.160]  amendment didn't create a new tax and the Congress you know like title 12
[3:36:44.160 --> 3:36:49.960]  chapter 3 sub chapter 12 section 411 essentially says federal reserve notes
[3:36:49.960 --> 3:36:53.600]  can be redeemed and lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department but
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:37:00.600]  they don't do that exactly so you know a question I had is you know we said that
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:06.080]  the Federal Reserve is a as a private credit and you know we have this whole
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:11.720]  system of taxation everything based on the fact that we use this private credit
[3:37:11.720 --> 3:37:17.480]  currency voluntarily so but but it really isn't voluntarily because they
[3:37:17.480 --> 3:37:21.960]  forced it to be not just the US currency but the world currency and the
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:26.080]  establishment has been debasing the value of that as a form of theft but back
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:29.560]  when it still had its value they bought up real assets with it and then we end up
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:34.160]  paying taxes to back up the value of that currency so it really isn't a private
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:38.440]  voluntary currency it's a private currency the the profit is private the
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:42.200]  cost is put on to the public I appreciate your call Sean Steven Vegas
[3:37:42.200 --> 3:37:44.920]  you're on the air
[3:37:45.440 --> 3:37:51.440]  Steven Las Vegas, Nevada you're on the air yes good afternoon Alex welcome Steve
[3:37:51.440 --> 3:37:57.920]  I originally got on I was hoping to speak to Peter I worked for his dad for five
[3:37:57.920 --> 3:38:03.720]  years his father is in a prison Peter Schiff for educating people on how to
[3:38:03.720 --> 3:38:06.720]  expose the private IRS or the collection agency for the private
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:11.480]  Federal Reserve and but he's in prison for that than all these politicians they
[3:38:11.480 --> 3:38:17.360]  don't have to pay taxes right he wrote a book and I guess writing a book can be
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:23.240]  construed as illegal I remember that a few years ago he said so just for those
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:27.400]  that don't know let me just tell me you can talk okay the judge ruled that he's
[3:38:27.400 --> 3:38:31.800]  not allowed to sell that book so yeah burning books basically go ahead right
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:37.760]  he wrote the book and and now he's got to do jail time you'd ask you know how
[3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:41.520]  come we aren't getting any prosecutions I would submit to you that that's one of
[3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:47.320]  the reasons that federal employees are our public servants are so busy
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:51.360]  prosecuting people for writing the illegal books that they don't have time
[3:38:51.360 --> 3:38:56.880]  to prosecute any politicians that are any in the Wall Street criminals or
[3:38:56.880 --> 3:39:00.840]  anybody like that well yeah I mean the government exists now as a rogue as
[3:39:00.840 --> 3:39:07.080]  institution to protect the criminals that run the government the last guest
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:11.320]  that you had on I hope maybe you can get the silver and gold guy to send him a
[3:39:11.320 --> 3:39:17.520]  copy of Jekyll Island because I had a I had a you know I wanted when I heard
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:24.120]  him say that that was that by the bad loans I wrote it down for the from the
[3:39:24.120 --> 3:39:28.720]  banks so that they'll be comfortable loaning well they they create the money
[3:39:28.720 --> 3:39:34.040]  out of bookkeeping entries I mean well why would they be that way that last
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:38.400]  guy is pure establishment we had him on to see if he'd you know slip up and say
[3:39:38.400 --> 3:39:43.240]  something like we need him we need him he's he's got the ear of many people in
[3:39:43.240 --> 3:39:48.080]  Washington DC if we could get him less than the info wars for a week he'd be
[3:39:48.080 --> 3:39:52.200]  brought up to speed immediately that guy was the counsel of the president
[3:39:52.200 --> 3:39:56.280]  believe me the little comment about how you didn't know about Rex 84 give me a
[3:39:56.280 --> 3:40:03.520]  break give me oh yeah I didn't see that I'd hope to have met Peter before and
[3:40:03.520 --> 3:40:10.680]  I'd hope maybe I emailed Aaron maybe the next time you get him on I'd like to
[3:40:10.680 --> 3:40:13.840]  dive with there's a lot of people there wondering how everyone's doing an
[3:40:13.840 --> 3:40:17.040]  incarceration you know we have to do to get him out of jail I hear you and I
[3:40:17.040 --> 3:40:20.760]  appreciate his calling I'll let you go sometime go others I almost brought it
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:23.800]  up to but I got busy during the breaks taking care of stuff I wanted to ask if
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:26.440]  it was alright with him in the talk about his dad being in prison because I
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:29.360]  never heard him talking about that we interviewed our everyone chef here on
[3:40:29.360 --> 3:40:34.480]  many times he had a show on the Genesis Network ten years ago for about a year
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:39.960]  and a half I mean everyone had a nightly show here everyone chef so they did
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:43.040]  seem to present for writing a book they said don't get pretty more of those
[3:40:43.040 --> 3:40:48.120]  books about the Federal Reserve in a scam and that's you heard his son and
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:52.360]  next time he's all bring this up but I don't want to you know run folks off
[3:40:52.360 --> 3:40:58.280]  because I like Peter and you know he's a golden boy the mainstream media so it
[3:40:58.280 --> 3:41:02.360]  was a rod Paul promoting him so you know we'll have him on but that little
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:05.880]  comment at the end about well yeah now the government's taken over the Federal
[3:41:05.880 --> 3:41:08.760]  Reserve and that's the problem was supposed to be independent it is the
[3:41:08.760 --> 3:41:12.560]  government private corporations act as governmental powers throughout history
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:16.760]  you know there's biggest governments and it's controlling our government not the
[3:41:16.760 --> 3:41:20.120]  other way around another government is just massing more powers and handing it
[3:41:20.120 --> 3:41:24.520]  over to the Federal Reserve through the banker bailout bill but Erwin was Erwin's
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:28.400]  son Peter Schiff was talking about that's one thing I've heard him say I
[3:41:28.400 --> 3:41:32.040]  don't agree with but it was at the end of the interviews I couldn't you know
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:37.320]  follow it to its conclusion to flesh it out with him because you know the
[3:41:37.320 --> 3:41:42.520]  Federal Reserve is the source of all the problems here's a smart guy though he
[3:41:42.520 --> 3:41:46.320]  knows all about this stuff he knows that by not going into those areas you know
[3:41:46.320 --> 3:41:49.080]  he could still get on the media and talk about the basic facts against the
[3:41:49.080 --> 3:41:53.160]  bailout the rest of it so we appreciate him coming on let's go ahead and talk
[3:41:53.160 --> 3:41:58.520]  to Ryan in Illinois Ryan you're on the air hi I'll just call to talk about how
[3:41:58.520 --> 3:42:03.160]  everybody's trying to get the whole Obama situation all messed up they think
[3:42:03.160 --> 3:42:08.520]  that you know he's the next you know pretty much I wouldn't like to say
[3:42:08.520 --> 3:42:12.960]  Jesus but um that's what I'll have to go there are a lot of churches saying he
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:18.240]  is no sire yeah president of the world savior of the world yeah but most of the
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:21.480]  people of the culture that I'm in I'm an artist myself a lot of the culture
[3:42:21.480 --> 3:42:26.200]  basically accepted him for you know whatever it seems and nobody's really
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:30.080]  paying attention any of the policies or anything that's going on it's craziness
[3:42:30.080 --> 3:42:33.680]  because you know the first thing that he should have done when he came in the
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:37.320]  office would have been you know go after the Federal Reserve like you just set up
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:41.280]  a minute ago not even you know that would have been key because that
[3:42:41.280 --> 3:42:45.680]  obviously is you know everything that's debasing our currency right now why
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:49.960]  wouldn't you have the ability to just say you know he's trying to like play
[3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:53.480]  off things like how I don't know if you read this he was he was trying to take
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:57.800]  away all like the gifting to all like the politicians and the head people it
[3:42:57.800 --> 3:43:01.360]  makes no sense it's just a way to just send everybody in the opposite direction
[3:43:01.360 --> 3:43:05.840]  while no he'll he'll he'll he'll he'll do one thing and then do all this other
[3:43:05.840 --> 3:43:09.080]  window dressing I'm closing on Donimo but he really isn't he's just setting up
[3:43:09.080 --> 3:43:13.200]  more camps and continuing the secret arrest or I'm real mad about these
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:18.240]  banks getting all this compensation but meanwhile he's you know people running
[3:43:18.240 --> 3:43:21.600]  him or the architects of all this this is by design they did everything they
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:24.960]  could all these administrations to de-industrialize the country to get
[3:43:24.960 --> 3:43:28.360]  us totally in debt and pull the rug out from under us it's all staged and the
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:31.880]  ruling elite need the media the military this whole system to make sure
[3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:37.320]  they're able to carry out this final phase of of bondage of enslavement of the
[3:43:37.320 --> 3:43:42.720]  population so that's it and that's that but I appreciate your call good to hear
[3:43:42.720 --> 3:43:47.520]  from you we're moving along here Michael in Illinois you're on the air
[3:43:47.520 --> 3:43:53.720]  Alex I I just wanted to comment on your last last caller I'm an MP economics
[3:43:53.720 --> 3:43:59.560]  writer myself the problem he had with them with the buying the bad assets from
[3:43:59.560 --> 3:44:04.320]  the banks and the setting up the bad bank and this is like the Republicans new
[3:44:04.320 --> 3:44:08.360]  answer to everything Obama's doing the problem with that is it leaves us in the
[3:44:08.360 --> 3:44:13.120]  same mess we're in now it doesn't get us out of the mess all it does is it
[3:44:13.120 --> 3:44:17.200]  creates the new bubble will never get out of this mess yeah there's there's
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:20.280]  two things you know there's more than one way to skin a cat and all the things
[3:44:20.280 --> 3:44:23.680]  they're doing expand the power of the criminal bankers that engineered all of
[3:44:23.680 --> 3:44:30.680]  this absolutely and then we can go ahead well until until fractional reserve
[3:44:30.680 --> 3:44:36.760]  banking which is nothing but theft until fractional reserve banking is stopped
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:40.240]  we're going to continue having these booms and busts and until the Federal
[3:44:40.240 --> 3:44:44.640]  Reserve goes down we will continue it having having the business cycle and
[3:44:44.640 --> 3:44:49.200]  having these problems and it's never gonna end I hear you and I agree with you
[3:44:49.200 --> 3:44:55.720]  and I appreciate your call Maggie in Texas you're on the air yes Alex you've
[3:44:55.720 --> 3:45:02.320]  been talking about advertising propaganda and I just wanted to call to your
[3:45:02.320 --> 3:45:07.640]  attention what I consider the most diabolically evil advertising campaign
[3:45:07.640 --> 3:45:14.960]  I've ever seen and that is the recent vaccines are like hugs Garda shell it's
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:19.600]  like a hug to take the experimental live cancer virus shot that on the insert
[3:45:19.600 --> 3:45:23.320]  they admit causes all sorts of autoimmune diseases and death in some
[3:45:23.320 --> 3:45:28.160]  cases and which doesn't even protect you from genital war it's but oh it's a
[3:45:28.160 --> 3:45:34.240]  huggy one let's pull that up Gardasil hug at Gardasil even talk yeah okay go
[3:45:34.240 --> 3:45:38.080]  ahead what I've seen another Gardasil where it's a loving and then she's
[3:45:38.080 --> 3:45:40.360]  hugging your daughter you're saying there's one where they actually say it's
[3:45:40.360 --> 3:45:46.080]  like a hug no I yes but this is this is a different one this is a billboard it
[3:45:46.080 --> 3:45:52.520]  shows an adorable baby and it says vaccines are like hugs you don't want
[3:45:52.520 --> 3:45:58.160]  to miss you've seen it okay I've got a picture of it that I took with on trails
[3:45:58.160 --> 3:46:02.920]  in the background and you used to have a place for graphics like this do you

[3:46:07.240 --> 3:46:12.720]  do you use to be but there used to be on before your info or as web page changed
[3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:17.520]  a lot there used to be a spot for people to contribute graphics most the best
[3:46:17.520 --> 3:46:23.560]  place for you is to go post that stuff in the prisonplanet.com forum and then
[3:46:23.560 --> 3:46:28.200]  tens of thousands every day are in there and a look at it do I have to be a
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:33.720]  member of that for I don't exactly know no it's free how do you do it or could I
[3:46:33.720 --> 3:46:39.320]  contact Watson about it or just figure this out myself yeah I mean I've seen
[3:46:39.320 --> 3:46:43.560]  the billboard now that you talk about it so little baby laying there and it says
[3:46:43.560 --> 3:46:49.800]  vaccines are like hugs but I mean you say you know how to email something so
[3:46:49.800 --> 3:46:53.640]  it's the same deal you just go to prisonplanet forum was it forum prison
[3:46:53.640 --> 3:46:58.440]  planet.com and then you just create a username it could be anything you want
[3:46:58.440 --> 3:47:03.880]  to be George Washington 97 and then you know I did that a long time ago and
[3:47:03.880 --> 3:47:07.960]  never used it again so I've forgotten it will that give me a problem no you can
[3:47:07.960 --> 3:47:11.320]  just create whatever you want it will not fake email addresses whatever you want
[3:47:11.320 --> 3:47:17.520]  to make things up I will try it okay this has con trails in the chem trails in
[3:47:17.520 --> 3:47:23.160]  the background nutrition trails yeah that's it nutrition trails in the
[3:47:23.160 --> 3:47:26.880]  background and if you don't like the chem trails you're with al-qaeda thank
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:31.480]  you Maggie Scott in Arizona you're on the year worldwide nutrition trails I
[3:47:31.480 --> 3:47:37.440]  like that that's good how you doing today good sir good good hey I just want to
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:43.440]  pass along the possible word to you as a way to maybe kind of expand network out
[3:47:43.440 --> 3:47:48.240]  what what you're doing to get the word out and God bless you for it I've been
[3:47:48.240 --> 3:47:53.760]  aware of you for I don't know 10 12 years now and I there's a gentleman who
[3:47:53.760 --> 3:47:57.240]  has these billboards he posts all the time you may have heard of him Bill
[3:47:57.240 --> 3:48:02.160]  balsamico Casa de ice although I don't think from the billboards that he puts
[3:48:02.160 --> 3:48:06.480]  up in front of his restaurant that he's quite as in-depth and understanding
[3:48:06.480 --> 3:48:10.840]  maybe as you and I might be as to what's going on in our country today but
[3:48:10.840 --> 3:48:14.760]  he's he's very disenchanted with both sides of the political parties and he's
[3:48:14.760 --> 3:48:18.920]  always posting stuff having to do with immigration things that you know that
[3:48:18.920 --> 3:48:24.360]  that antics at the president's poll my guess is because these emails of these
[3:48:24.360 --> 3:48:29.760]  billboards hit so many people out there that maybe are not listening to info
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:33.960]  wars but also are disenchanted with what's going on that if you tried to get
[3:48:33.960 --> 3:48:38.400]  up if you just look up Casa de ice dot com it's Casa the letter D ice dot com
[3:48:38.400 --> 3:48:43.000]  well a lot of us don't know what you're talking about what what's going on you
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:47.400]  just talking about a gentleman just has a website if you go to Casa de ice dot
[3:48:47.400 --> 3:48:51.040]  com he has a restaurant I don't remember what state he's in but he posts
[3:48:51.040 --> 3:48:56.280]  political messages about how disgusted he is with what's going on in our
[3:48:56.280 --> 3:49:01.360]  government today what I'm saying is because he's already in that line of
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:05.560]  thinking of not being happy with what's going on I think if somebody out of your
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:10.320]  office were to contact him chitchat a little bit maybe even have him on he
[3:49:10.320 --> 3:49:14.800]  would probably be more than willing to start posting possibly info wars dot
[3:49:14.800 --> 3:49:21.200]  com on my area border otherwise listen how you sir look look I hear you and
[3:49:21.200 --> 3:49:24.320]  appreciate it I'm just getting my new people in line I'm just getting
[3:49:24.320 --> 3:49:27.560]  computers going and editing software and packages and we're reaching millions
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:31.240]  every day and it's all about you spreading the word about the show if
[3:49:31.240 --> 3:49:34.120]  somebody wants to contact somebody who's putting billboards up and ask him to
[3:49:34.120 --> 3:49:38.000]  put up info wars dot com or whatever that's great we don't have the money for
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:42.920]  that and I'm not generally out there you know people tuning in here you know
[3:49:42.920 --> 3:49:45.440]  want to hear what I have to say so I can tell people what I want to have to say
[3:49:45.440 --> 3:49:49.200]  but I don't really cold call folks out but that sounds like an interesting idea
[3:49:49.200 --> 3:49:53.120]  and if people have the funds out there don't wait for orders from headquarters
[3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:56.200]  go to the sound of the guns you know some catchy phrase like don't be a sucker
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:50:01.720]  info wars dot com our walking billboards get our t-shirts and info wars dot
[3:50:01.720 --> 3:50:05.000]  com and get them out it's all about getting the word out but yes that's a
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:10.200]  great idea and so folks contact whoever this nice fellow is and tell him tell
[3:50:10.200 --> 3:50:13.600]  him to wake up to what's going on there yeah I mean on the immigration issue the
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:17.240]  globalist for it I'm against it then you analyze why they're for it then you
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:20.360]  even more against it but it's real simple just whatever they're for your
[3:50:20.360 --> 3:50:24.520]  against they want to overrun every nation with third-world populations I'm not
[3:50:24.520 --> 3:50:28.440]  against these poor third-world populations but we can't let it happen the
[3:50:28.440 --> 3:50:32.320]  globalist wanted to drive down wages bankrupt the states and their health
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:36.000]  care and welfare systems for total federalization and then internationalization
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:41.680]  so you don't get Glenn Spencer back on it's probably been a year since I've had

[3:55:53.200 --> 3:55:58.160]  welcome hey good afternoon Alex how you doing today pretty good sir I just want
[3:55:58.160 --> 3:56:00.880]  to keep you informed about what's happening on the east coast of Fort
[3:56:00.880 --> 3:56:05.200]  Bragg is they're increasing the amount of troops within the next year to from
[3:56:05.200 --> 3:56:08.520]  fifty thousand to seventy thousand no they admit that's for the United States
[3:56:08.520 --> 3:56:11.760]  mm-hmm that's public and I was just wondering you know maybe you and your
[3:56:11.760 --> 3:56:14.640]  your bunch of merry men could come out here and maybe stop talk with the
[3:56:14.640 --> 3:56:18.920]  soldiers and tell them sort of what's going on I would love to be able to do
[3:56:18.920 --> 3:56:24.400]  that but I'm working 18 hours a day lately and you know I go home see my
[3:56:24.400 --> 3:56:28.880]  family come back at night and I've gone to bases and off bases and talked to
[3:56:28.880 --> 3:56:33.080]  trips that are doing drills to take over the US and people denied it now they
[3:56:33.080 --> 3:56:38.000]  admit they're doing it so you know that it's up to the American people to reach
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:44.200]  out to the troops other than spreading the word what what could I possibly do
[3:56:44.200 --> 3:56:48.800]  what what what types of CDs would you like me to pass out to some of the
[3:56:48.800 --> 3:56:52.320]  troops because I've gotten to know them within the last couple months okay okay
[3:56:52.320 --> 3:56:55.720]  what'll impress them is seeing a ten-year-old or eight-year-old film I
[3:56:55.720 --> 3:57:00.080]  made like police state 2000 police state to the takeover police state three
[3:57:00.080 --> 3:57:08.360]  total enslavement and I show everything they're training to do and I document how
[3:57:08.360 --> 3:57:12.640]  their plans gonna work and here you are ten years later and it all happened just
[3:57:12.640 --> 3:57:17.320]  like I said hey you know I've got a three CD combo pack you can get them make all
[3:57:17.320 --> 3:57:21.200]  the copies you want I want you to get them out to people I would give them in
[3:57:21.200 --> 3:57:25.840]  game I would give them terror storms so they know the terror was staged things
[3:57:25.840 --> 3:57:29.240]  like that and the troops aren't bad people they're just brainwashed and
[3:57:29.240 --> 3:57:32.360]  ignorant most of them or those that do know what's happening or freaked out
[3:57:32.360 --> 3:57:35.440]  well I mean you know the majority of troops gave their money to Ron Paul in
[3:57:35.440 --> 3:57:38.240]  the campaign and supported him so yeah it shows they know what's going on but
[3:57:38.240 --> 3:57:41.240]  the commanders are pure evil you can forget trying to wake up the high-level
[3:57:41.240 --> 3:57:44.240]  commanders they've been picked because their globalists and hate this country
[3:57:44.240 --> 3:57:49.680]  their traders the other troops have just been conditioned and we just have to
[3:57:49.680 --> 3:57:53.560]  unbrainwash them that's it appreciate the call jamming in one more Dan in
[3:57:53.560 --> 3:57:57.120]  Texas sorry to Betsy everybody oh Betsy disagrees I'm sorry we're going to

[3:58:07.320 --> 3:58:11.120]  simple disagreement which is you know you actually said it earlier I don't think

[3:58:14.480 --> 3:58:19.880]  I'll give you two examples one was when Mark was marked ice did the Informa
[3:58:19.880 --> 3:58:23.760]  soldier campaign where he came up with an idea and we spread it out there like he
[3:58:23.760 --> 3:58:27.360]  gave orders from headquarters you did the same thing went before 9-11 on your
