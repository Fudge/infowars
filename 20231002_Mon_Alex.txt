[00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.960]  And the risk of these vaccines that have now been given to literally billions of people
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.160]  in the sense of global use of the vaccine is really quite safe. So we know myocarditis with
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.960]  COVID is very rare and then with the vaccines there was an explosion of myocarditis. Thousands
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.920]  of cases reported the CDC. Fatal cases, paper by Hulsher and colleagues, I'm the senior author,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.240]  shows autopsy proven fatal cases of myocarditis never happened with COVID. So Fauci again is
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.000]  misleading the public trying to downplay COVID vaccine myocarditis. It's a killer.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.160]  In a new letter, Oversight Committee Republican Brad Wenstrup claims that quote,
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.720]  information provided suggests that Dr. Fauci was escorted into Central Intelligence Agency
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.120]  headquarters without a record of entry and participated in the analysis to influence
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.480]  the agency's review of the origins of COVID-19. It's congressional subpoenas and documents that
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.080]  have come in as they dig into gain of function and the COVID response and myocarditis and blood clots
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.960]  and infertility that has come out that Fauci quarterbacked and commanded with the Rockefeller
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.480]  Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment via the CIA the worldwide disinformation response that COVID
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.080]  didn't come out of a lab and then later that the shots worked and then quarterbacking censorship
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.200]  through the intelligence agencies of the world and then through big tech. Now this is coming
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.800]  out in Congress and it's a big big deal that they specifically knew that it was causing
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.000]  massive heart attacks, blood clots, strokes, myocarditis. Double vaxxed, booster, flu shot
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.120]  and I'm gonna be honest, I have the shingle shot too. Never got COVID, clearly
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.520]  Jesus loves me the most, seriously. So nice, so nice.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.600]  And that half of those that developed this type of myocarditis would be dead within 10 years,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.040]  most of them within five and they had these meetings. Yeah well this is a situation where
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.640]  the whistleblower actually came to us. This whistleblower works at the CIA, was a high level
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.680]  employee there, had been there for many years. He reached out to our intelligence committee in
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.400]  the House of Representatives and then he also reached out to the select subcommittee on the
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.840]  coronavirus pandemic. The CIA put together a team called the COVID Discovery Team and this team
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.680]  consisted of seven people with scientific backgrounds. Six of the seven at the end of the
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.120]  day came forward and they said with some confidence that they felt that COVID originated from the lab,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.320]  a lab in China. The lead person felt that it came from nature. What he is alleging is that also
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.640]  with some monetary compensation, their minds were changed if you will and they went from leaning
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.040]  towards the lab but coming out and saying that the CIA was unable to determine where this came
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.200]  from. The big question in all this comes into is why? Why would this this take place at all?
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.880]  We were actually trading China advanced biotechnology for access to collect intelligence
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.520]  on their bioweapons laboratory including Dr. Peter Daszak telling me that he's working with the CIA.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.800]  So Dr. Peter Daszak is working with the CIA is that what you just said?
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.840]  Correct and even people in the CIA and this is coming out said this is illegal what we're doing.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.880]  Now look people don't seem to care when I tell you about something after it happens but if you're
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.400]  a new viewer I've probably said in the last three and a half years that the CIA is running all this
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.920]  with the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundation about 2,000 times conservatively. Fauci's above the CIA.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.640]  He's a Ford Foundation, Carnegie, Rockefeller Foundation, eugenics leader. Those are the top
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.600]  foundations that put the people through college, put them in their foundations, then put them in
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.680]  regulatory agencies and put them back in the foundations and then start putting them in big
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.920]  pharma. That's why all of the FDA board members are former board members or presidents or heads
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.480]  of the board of Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, Bayer, AstraZeneca. I mean every damn one of them but
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.440]  the people at the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie endowment level they know what's going
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.200]  on. Remember I told you decades ago the Carnegie endowment's the top of the pyramid and the rich
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.560]  people got together about 120 years ago, 125 years ago and they said let's take over society, take
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.560]  over medicine, set up a world government, then slowly poison everybody to death and Hitler was
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.360]  like a false start for them or a spinoff. It was like a trailer that didn't get the full season
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:58.080]  but we're now experiencing the full production now. The fancy, slick, covert, camouflaged crazy town.

[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:17.760]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.240]  All right, I got a lot of really hardcore mass death depopulation news being directed by the
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.400]  WEF and the globalists that own and control it. It's going to be an incredibly important
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.280]  transmission. I've canceled the guests we have coming up, so I have three, four hours to get to
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.080]  everything and take your phone calls. But it's also important to make fun of these globalists
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.280]  as well, so there's a great new little parody piece put out about Klaus Schwab that goes
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.040]  through some of his greatest hits. It'll actually go through the mainstream news where they're
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.200]  announcing everything. School children to be force-fed bugs. Here in the United States,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.680]  it's already begun. So here are some of the greatest hits of Klaus Schwab and the new Nazi party.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.880]  From the people who brought you. You know Nazi.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.760]  And be happy. Comes a brand new collection of hit songs from our beloved supreme leader.

[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:11.760]  The New Willie Memes, Fun, and Shwerbles.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.800]  Even the mainline top meme channels that haven't really been political in the past
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:28.240]  are now awake to the new world order. Well, I had quite a weekend of research
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:37.680]  and making connections or intensifying connections. I talked to basically all the top podcasters,
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.680]  the top broadcasters in the world that are in the resistance against the new world order.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.760]  And they have all accelerated their growth curve of understanding now where they are quote,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.160]  in the globalist eyes, as radical as I am. So thanks to listeners, thanks to viewers support
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.840]  and the affiliates and the crew support of this broadcast, we have had devastating success
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.920]  getting people to really realize what the new world order master plan is.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.840]  World government to carry out forced depopulation. And you're going to see some big moves
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.400]  by the biggest people out there against the new world order now.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.920]  You're about to see total commitment. You think you've seen a hardcore awakening so far?
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.440]  You think Elon Musk has been outspoken so far? You think Joe Rogan's been outspoken so far?
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.840]  You think Tucker Carlson's been outspoken so far?
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:39.200]  They are now immersed in what's really going on. And we can question whether Elon is on our side
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.760]  or not. Regardless, he's acting like he is on every front making major moves, but have the
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.200]  system trying to take him down right now. And he's shooting videos at his Texas ranch firing
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:56.160]  50 caliber rifles handheld, which is, of course, an Alex Jones classic with McCaffey.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.600]  So as negative as all this news is, there is a lot of really positive news. Humanity is not
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.120]  going down without a fight. All right. I told you I did a lot of research this weekend.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.160]  So focused, I did not even crack a beer and I like to drink a few beers on the weekend.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:25.200]  So I have been totally immersed the entire weekend, other than swimming a few hours with
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:33.120]  my daughter and hiking a little bit in research. And this broadcast is particularly loaded for
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.720]  bear. The frustration is once I get in here with all of this, every one of these articles
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.880]  is incredibly important. And I'm like, how in the world do I cover this? I mean, whoa.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.400]  The cashless society, world government clips, I have like seven of them.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.320]  But the head of the EU, you name it, announcing, yeah, we're going to have
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.760]  cashless society soon. And it's going to control everything you buy, sell and do.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.160]  That's just one stack. And it's an inch thick.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.000]  W.E.F. caught orchestrating U.S. border crisis for military bases in Panama.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.720]  And now Congress is waking up thanks to Michael, Jan and others. And the U.N. and the W.E.F. openly
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.840]  run these giant bases, former U.S. military bases. They've massively expanded them to hold
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.080]  tens of thousands of people. I mean, it is incredible. And they're funding them and busing
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:32.880]  them right in. Amazing. We've got huge geoengineering news on the admission that
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.280]  they are spraying all the things that experts 25 years ago were testing and saying they were.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.640]  They don't just modify the weather, but also extremely toxic to plants, animals and humans.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.880]  The neurological diseases are exploding. Got a big stack of the music industry in Hollywood
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:58.400]  openly promoting devil worship and pedophilia. We have the Democrat caught pulling the fire alarm
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.480]  when the Democrats were trying to stop the vote. They were trying to get more pork
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.040]  barrel on there. And he says now it was an accident. He thought it was a door handle.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:15.040]  The memes certainly had some fun with that one. There's new intel coming out that the
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.920]  chief chef at the Obama House in Martha's Vineyard was writing a tell all book when he
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:29.280]  drowned in four feet of water. Jack Smith demands gag order for Trump proclaiming General Milley
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.800]  should be executed for treason. Putin's closest ally and his vice president.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.760]  He's the head of the parliament. Oh, warns World War Three. If UK troops are sent to Ukraine,
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.360]  the UK says they are sending troops. Let me give you a newsflash. They're already there.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.640]  Bombshell report by a prestigious medical journal confirming what Edward Dowd and other statisticians
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.600]  have brought us. He got some of the top statisticians working for him. He says 20 million
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:07.840]  covid vaccines. Causality. Link to increase mortality resulting in 17 million extra deaths.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.520]  Just incredible covid poisoning stack that we're going to be.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:23.920]  Laying out here for you today, an incredible illustrative video that's only three minutes
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.400]  long that I'm going to air at the start of the next hour, and then I'm going to spend 30 minutes
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:35.760]  on it. RFK Jr. was on C-SPAN and they had these seminar callers calling in.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.240]  Saying. Oh, you're crazy. 5G doesn't cause cancer. Oh, you're crazy. 5G doesn't surveil you.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.120]  Oh, you're crazy. Nothing's hurting the frogs. It's good. Oh, you're crazy. There's no early
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:55.200]  puberty. Oh, you're crazy. SSRIs aren't tied on the labels to mass murder and violence. It says
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:02.080]  the label they are. So I thought we'd just do a little research. And just get a small portion
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.760]  of mainline news and scientific studies on these subjects, because the mindset of the caller is
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.360]  just perfectly illustrative of what's happening. You sit here and you warn people about real things
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:19.360]  going on. Whether it's geoengineering or the poison shots or any of it, or fluoride in the
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.360]  water for that matter, or aspartame, which they now admit causes cancer and brain damage and
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.960]  all sorts of problems, the UN admits. Well, that was known. They couldn't get it approved in the
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.760]  70s. And then Donald Rumsfeld and the Reagan administration got it approved. That's all out.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:43.040]  And then they say, how dare you scare us, RFK Jr.? So you warned somebody not to stick their
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.360]  hand in a rattlesnake den, and you're the bad one. That's all coming up. That's only the tip
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.880]  of the iceberg. I am loaded for bear. Please call everyone you know and people you don't know.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.200]  Call everybody you know. Tune in now. Infowars.com forward slash show. That's the coordinates of

[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.600]  because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.200]  And these are game-changing products. It's like our information's game-changing. These

[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:34.960]  4,000 bottles of each one of these. We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.640]  love so much. We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 testosterone boost that just came in.

[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:08.780]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:18.470]  We now take you live.
[00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:27.190]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance,
[00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:33.710]  rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.710]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:43.710]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to see.
[00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.710]  You want freedom?
[00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.710]  You want to stop the enemies of humanity?
[00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.710]  We've analyzed their entire attack profile.
[00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.710]  We reverse engineered the whole thing.
[00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.710]  We know how to stop it dead in its tracks.
[00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.710]  The first thing you've got to do is admit you're under attack.
[00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.710]  And admit there's a devil.
[00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.710]  Admit there's a God.
[00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:09.710]  You admit that, but on the full armor of God.
[00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.710]  You are invincible.
[00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.710]  Yes, the attacks come, and they hurt.
[00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:27.710]  But every time you take a hit, you just get stronger.
[00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.710]  They are building a wonderland for mad scientists.
[00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:41.710]  They're establishing a world government of eugenicist depopulationist transhumanism.
[00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:46.710]  And for those about to spread the word, those about to get more informed,
[00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.710]  we salute you with a 21-gun salute.
[00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.710]  We are down the front lines.
[00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.710]  All right, let's launch into, let's just start here.
[00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.710]  Got to start someplace, don't we?
[00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.710]  Overhead shot, please, for TV viewers.
[00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.710]  These are both mainstream news headlines.
[00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.710]  What, out of Bloomberg and AP?
[00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:23.710]  Workers lost $3.7 trillion in earnings during the pandemic.
[00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.710]  Women in Gen Z saw the biggest losses.
[00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.710]  That's the U.S. alone.
[00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.710]  Then here's another headline.
[00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:36.710]  World's billionaires get richer by 3.9 trillion during pandemic.
[00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:41.710]  Can you figure out what's going on here just a little bit?
[00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:47.710]  This is in the mainstream German news now.
[00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:53.710]  Germany caught funneling billions, three-plus billion euros,
[00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.710]  to Bill Gates to depopulate country of, quote, undesirable citizens.
[00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.710]  That's in the biggest German newspapers.
[00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.710]  Depopulate?
[00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.710]  Isn't that liberal?
[00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.710]  Where have I heard of that in Germany before?
[00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:13.710]  Here it is, out of the major German newspaper.
[00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.710]  The federal government is supporting Gates Foundation projects
[00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.710]  with 3.8 billion euros.
[00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.710]  Big, lengthy report.
[00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.710]  Might want to read it.
[00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.710]  But let's go to this little clip first.
[00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.710]  Oh, this is extremely illustrative.
[00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:41.710]  Here's a World Economic Forum, WEF agenda contributor, Marina Mazzucato.
[00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:46.710]  Our attempt to vaccinate the entire planet failed.
[00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.710]  Climate change is too abstract for people to understand,
[00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:57.710]  but the coming water crisis is something that everybody will get on board with.
[00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:01.710]  They're restricting water supplies all over the planet.
[00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.710]  They've passed legislation to take pure aquifer water all over Canada,
[00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.710]  the U.S., England, Europe, you name it,
[00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.710]  and put it through a bunch of chemical processors to poison the living hell out of it
[00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:21.710]  and to give it way more expensive pricing to then make the cost of water go up.
[00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.710]  Water has always been free in the U.K.
[00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.710]  They live on a giant crystal clear aquifer.
[00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.710]  Now they're starting to charge for it.
[00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:32.710]  This is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.710]  So here is the clip of them explaining, ooh, cutting your water off,
[00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.710]  that'll really get you to accept world government.
[00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.710]  Here it is.
[00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.710]  Also, of course, true with COVID, right?
[00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.710]  We are all only as healthy as our neighbor is on our street, in our city,
[00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.710]  in our region, in our nation, and globally.
[00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:50.710]  Did we solve that?
[00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.710]  Did we actually manage to vaccinate everyone in the world?
[00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:54.710]  No.
[00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.710]  So highlighting water as a global commons and what it means to work together
[00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:01.710]  and see it both out of that kind of global commons perspective
[00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:05.710]  but also the self-interest perspective because it does have that parallel.
[00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.710]  It's not only important, but it's also important because we haven't managed
[00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.710]  to solve those problems which had similar attributes,
[00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.710]  and water is something that people understand.
[00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.710]  Climate change is a bit abstract.
[00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.710]  Some people understand it really well.
[00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:19.710]  Some understand it a bit.
[00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:20.710]  Some just don't understand it.
[00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.710]  Water, every kid knows how important it is to have water.
[00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.710]  When you're playing football and you're thirsty, you need water.
[00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.710]  So there's also something about really getting citizen engagement around this
[00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:33.710]  and really in some ways experimenting with this notion of the common good.
[00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:38.710]  Can we actually deliver this time in ways that we have failed miserably other times?
[00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:42.710]  And hopefully we won't keep failing on the other things, but anyway.
[00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.710]  A lot of big takeaways there.
[00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.710]  They're failing miserably, and they go on to admit the full clip
[00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.710]  that it's for world government, new world order.
[00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.710]  We wrote an article about it this weekend that had the full clip in context.
[00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.710]  So their global government is failing.
[00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:00.710]  They create the crises or exacerbate the problems, opposes the saviors,
[00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:04.710]  and we have clips of the head of the EU, the head of the UN, Bill Gates.
[00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.710]  We've got Klaus Schwab, new clips.
[00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.710]  Want me to subject you to them?
[00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.710]  I probably will, at least some of them.
[00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:12.710]  Think I want to look at these people?
[00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.710]  Makes my blood boil.
[00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:18.710]  But they're admitting they're bringing in global currencies that are already here,
[00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.710]  already running China.
[00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.710]  Italy's already put it in as a beta test.
[00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:24.710]  They tried it in Nigeria.
[00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.710]  Now it's massively backfired.
[00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:27.710]  They're pulling it out there.
[00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.710]  I've got a clip on that with a big economist and professor breaking it down.
[00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.710]  But it just devastates economies, but it consolidates power.
[00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.710]  Remember those headlines?
[00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.710]  Workers lost $3.7 trillion in earnings during the pandemic.
[00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.710]  Women in Gen Z saw the biggest losses.
[00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.710]  Oh, but they care about women and minorities.
[00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:48.710]  Yeah, right.
[00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.710]  World's billionaires get richer by $3.9 trillion during the pandemic,
[00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.710]  more than doubling their wealth.
[00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.710]  It's not just some fancy new cool digital money.
[00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.710]  It tracks where you go, where you can spend it, how you can spend it.
[00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:04.710]  Totally surveils you.
[00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.710]  And they can devalue it whenever they want.
[00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.710]  And, of course, you can only spend it with them.
[00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.710]  So this is out of Melbourne.
[00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.710]  Another conspiracy bites the dust.
[00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.710]  Digital ID is set to be up and running as early as next year.
[00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.710]  Once it's coupled with a digital currency,
[00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.710]  you'll be disconnected from the system at any time.
[00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:28.710]  It's all about control, just saying no, refuse, resist, and rise.
[00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.710]  And that's what the head of the EU said.
[00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.710]  Yes, we track how you use the money.
[00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.710]  And, yes, we'll control some of where you can spend it.
[00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.710]  But it's okay.
[00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.710]  It's not Big Brother.
[00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.710]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.710]  Yes, we've got massive geoengineering spraying radioactive isotopes on you
[00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.710]  that are totally illegal.
[00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.710]  But it's a conspiracy if you don't like it.
[00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.710]  I have a CIA director, all of them saying it on video.
[00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.710]  But it doesn't exist, remember?
[00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.710]  And so what's happening is the general public and people in the government
[00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:03.710]  and big talk show hosts across the board realize that they're being targeted too.
[00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.710]  No matter how rich and powerful you are, if you're not in the inner club,
[00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:07.710]  you're being targeted.
[00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.710]  And the globalists get blowbacked themselves.
[00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:10.710]  They get hurt by their own attacks.
[00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.710]  It's insane.
[00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:13.710]  It's satanic.
[00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:14.710]  It's crazy.
[00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:15.710]  We've got to go to break.
[00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:18.710]  I'm going to come back with – and I've got, again, clips out of Europe,
[00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.710]  clips out of Canada, clips out of Australia.
[00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:21.710]  It's all the same.
[00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.710]  China's already got it in place for these digital nightmare currencies,
[00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:26.710]  but they've got to crash.
[00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:29.710]  They've got to crash the old system first.
[00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.710]  And notice how fast they're devaluing the dollar.
[00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.710]  I mean, inflation is insane.
[00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:38.710]  I had gone to a barbecue place that's been open since the 70s.
[00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.710]  I've been eating there since I lived here in the early 90s.
[00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.710]  And I hadn't been there in about six, seven years.
[00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.710]  And I said, hey, let's go to that barbecue place.
[00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:51.710]  I went there, and for my wife and I and my younger daughter to eat was $80.
[00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.710]  It would have been $30 just five years ago.
[00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:55.710]  $80.
[00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:56.710]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:03.710]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years
[00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.710]  because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's gone on.
[00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:08.710]  And these are game-changing products.
[00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.710]  It's like our information is game-changing.
[00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.710]  These products are incredible.
[00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:16.710]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:21.710]  All three of the Infowars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months
[00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.710]  are now back in stock but a very limited run
[00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:30.710]  because we only had a budget to get 3,000 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:36.710]  We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.710]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:47.710]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of PainMD, an incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.710]  All three of these are back in stock, and they're incredible,
[00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.710]  and they fund our operation at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.710]  I'm going to say something obvious right now,
[00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.710]  but it's usually the obvious things that we all miss, including myself.
[00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.710]  Everybody seems very excited about the impeachment of Joe Biden.
[00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.710]  But remember, he is a totally complete puppet.
[00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.710]  It needs to be about the criminals that control him, the CIA, BlackRock,
[00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.710]  the multinational corporations.
[00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:20.710]  People want to blame Obama. Yeah, he's above Biden, but he's still a puppet too.
[00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:25.710]  We need to make it about the power structure that's waging war against this country
[00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:29.710]  that's de-industrializing us and attacking our culture and creating race war.
[00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.710]  We need to make the impeachment all about the open borders
[00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.710]  and the human trafficking and the global government and the UN
[00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.710]  taking control of our medical system.
[00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.710]  That's what we need to do. That's what we've got to stand for.
[00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.710]  That's what is going to bring down the system.
[00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.710]  If we just make it about Biden, just about how horrible he is,
[00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.710]  how he's a pedophile and how his son's a crackhead and gun charges,
[00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.710]  it becomes a distraction from the larger issues.
[00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:58.710]  We'll cover it all live at Infowars.com.
[00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.710]  Bodies is back.
[00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.710]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfowarsStore.com
[00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.710]  and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:12.710]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.710]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year
[00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.710]  on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.710]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body,
[00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.710]  help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility,
[00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:31.710]  assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:37.710]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:43.710]  but our super-powerful extract using Bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.710]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system,
[00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.710]  so if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.

[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:08.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:14.470]  Fighting the good fight in the Info War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:22.470]  Get out in the streets, get to the city council, get to the school board.
[00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:27.470]  Go out and peacefully confront the politicians. Run for office, spread the word.
[00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:33.470]  Looking for adventure in whatever comes our way.
[00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.470]  And whatever comes our way.
[00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.470]  Fire all of your guns.
[00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.470]  Explode into space.
[00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:59.470]  You know, I saw a clip going around Twitter last week that had millions and millions and millions of views.
[00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.470]  And I was like, where is that from? I know that clip.
[00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:05.470]  And then I saw it again this weekend.
[00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:14.470]  And I went, oh, that's Ameriged in 2016 that Chuck Norris, his son, directed that Gary Haven starred in and produced.
[00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:19.470]  And it's a B-movie. I think it had like a $6 million budget, $7 million budget, something like that.
[00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:25.470]  But the content, the material, the script is five star.
[00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:28.470]  You know, the production is a lot of fun, but it's definitely a B-movie.
[00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:33.470]  It's definitely a B-movie, but everybody should see it and share it and show it to their children and young people.
[00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:39.470]  But it's definitely got a Walker, Texas Ranger feel to it and had most of that crew on it.
[00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:41.470]  Of course, I'm in the movie.
[00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:46.470]  But when you watch the clips in it, boy, did it not all come true.
[00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:51.470]  And the research Gary Haven did with folks to put this out is stellar.
[00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:54.470]  I'm not doing an ad for Ameriged in.
[00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:58.470]  I'm just saying you should see it. You should share it.
[00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:59.470]  You should watch it.
[00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:04.470]  So before I hit this real-time news actually happening, let's go ahead and roll a clip from Ameriged.
[00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.470]  Massive humanity.
[00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.470]  Africa, India, China.
[00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.470]  And then squalor.
[00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.470]  Maybe better off dead.
[00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.470]  The world would be better off without them.
[00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.470]  And America will be first.
[00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:42.470]  Yes.
[00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:52.470]  Well, as our friend Henry Kissinger said, a strong America is the only thing standing in the way of a new world order.
[00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:58.470]  We have foreign troops on the ground now under the U.N.
[00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:02.470]  Country only needs a little chaos.
[00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.470]  The American people are resilient.
[00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:09.470]  What's to come if the citizens rise up?
[00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.470]  Yes.
[00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:25.470]  When parents see their children starving and families hauled away to female camps for imprisonment or worse, then yes, yes, we expect some resistance at first.
[00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:29.470]  But the vanity of nationalism will quickly fade.
[00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.470]  The people will beg for help.
[00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.470]  Any help.
[00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:39.470]  These are but the birth pangs of change.
[00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:43.470]  The birth pangs of a new world order.
[00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.470]  That's based on statements of Kissinger and Maury Strong.
[00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:51.470]  That character looks like Maury Strong and is playing the character of Maury Strong.
[00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.470]  Might want to actually read his writings.
[00:36:54.470 --> 00:37:01.470]  And then you'll know their plan for destabilization and wonder why they're going after our families, why they have drag queen pedophile time.
[00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.470]  Why they have open borders and human trafficking and war.
[00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.470]  Evaluation of currencies.
[00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:12.470]  Germany caught funneling billions to Bill Gates to depopulate country of undesirable citizens.
[00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.470]  Major German newspapers reporting.
[00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:19.470]  Isn't that just precious?
[00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:29.470]  See, Bill Gates and all the rest of these globalists like George Soros don't spend their own money in their tax free foundation.
[00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:41.470]  They get your taxpayer money, put it in the foundation and the foundation buys the poison shots from Pfizer, Moderna and the rest of it that Bill Gates makes record profits off of.
[00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:47.470]  Then he puts it back in tax exempt and just keeps building the wealth and building the wealth.
[00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:55.470]  So when you hear that people like Jeff Bezos or people like Elon Musk are the richest man in the world, that's not true.
[00:37:55.470 --> 00:38:00.470]  They're the richest people that don't have these big foundations though.
[00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:07.470]  You notice as he retired last year, Bezos is now moving into that wheelhouse.
[00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:16.470]  So their holy grail is a digital currency that tracks everything you do, everywhere you go, controls what you can buy.
[00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:22.470]  It can be valued at any time and can only be spent where they say you can spend it with them.
[00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.470]  The Federal Reserve says they're getting it ready.
[00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.470]  The EU says they're launching it next year.
[00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.470]  Australia is launching it next year.
[00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:29.470]  It's here.
[00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:30.470]  It's not coming.
[00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.470]  It's here.
[00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:40.470]  And you notice if you try to pull through a restaurant, I don't eat a lot of fast food, but I'll go to Chick-fil-A or something if I'm in a hurry.
[00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:48.470]  And I was up already at 6 a.m. this morning out driving around taking care of things, and I pulled through.
[00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:53.470]  And they say, you know, have your app ready to scan, discounts if you scan.
[00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.470]  And it's the same everywhere.
[00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.470]  When you go into a regular restaurant, they want you to scan a QR code.
[00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:03.470]  That's all being run by the UN through the big business alliances and groups.
[00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.470]  And soon you won't be able to buy anything.
[00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:15.470]  Whole Foods in Europe and the U.K. and Canada and select stores here has turnstiles and makes you scan an app to even get in.
[00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:18.470]  And, of course, that's what's going on in communist China.
[00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:27.470]  To buy anything now or to get into a bathroom or use a toilet at the airport or to get in a vending machine or to go in a grocery store, you have to have it.
[00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.470]  It's going in everywhere.
[00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:31.470]  Now they're banning the small mom and pops.
[00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.470]  This is total takeover.
[00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:38.470]  And then once they own and control your access, then they can make you eat the bugs.
[00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.470]  So here's part of this newscast out of Australia on the Mark of the Beast.
[00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:50.470]  A digital ID system could be operating between governments and the private sector as soon as next year.
[00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:57.470]  The aim is to reduce the need for us all to share vast amounts of personal data with multiple organizations.
[00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:59.470]  We're going to go back to this in a minute.
[00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.470]  Start at the beginning.
[00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:08.470]  They make you show an ID to go in a restaurant or scan your phone that you've got a vaccine passport.
[00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:13.470]  That's the pretext and the foundation the U.N. admits to bring this in worldwide.
[00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:19.470]  But now to make it all easier, it's all on one government data app.
[00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.470]  And then later it's going to be in a chip, which they say it is.
[00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:26.470]  So before it's like, oh, you're crazy.
[00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.470]  They want to chip you.
[00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.470]  That was in government documents 25, 30 years ago.
[00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.470]  Now it's, oh, yeah, we want to chip you next.
[00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.470]  Don't be a kook.
[00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:38.470]  We've seen mainline headlines like the next big group we've got to deal with, anti-chippers.
[00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.470]  Continue with the newscast.
[00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:50.470]  A digital ID system could be operating between governments and the private sector as soon as next year.
[00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:58.470]  The aim is to reduce the need for us all to share vast amounts of personal data with multiple organizations.
[00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:04.470]  We've all seen what happens when companies that hold our personal information get hacked.
[00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.470]  And it's not just customers who worry.
[00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.470]  Small businesses have a high concern about cyber risks.
[00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:14.470]  They don't want to hold more personal information than they need to.
[00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:18.470]  Some organizations are doing away with this method and going digital.
[00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:23.470]  10.5 million Australians are using MyGovID for some government services.
[00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:26.470]  And there are private systems, too, like ConnectID.
[00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.470]  But they don't work together.
[00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:33.470]  Now the government is consulting with business to bring digital IDs into the mainstream.
[00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:41.470]  Making it easier, essentially, to live your life online, but with the minimum amount of sharing of documents.
[00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:47.470]  Right now you could be handing over lots of personal data any time you say sign up to a new phone plan,
[00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.470]  apply for a rental property or a new home loan.
[00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:54.470]  Things like your passport, driver's license, Medicare details, your birth certificate.
[00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:56.470]  Let's stop here.
[00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:58.470]  Let's go to break and come back with the rest of this.
[00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.470]  But we've got to really break this down.
[00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.470]  The governments demand all this.
[00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.470]  And then they go, oh, there's problems.
[00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:10.470]  So now we want a unified system so that if it gets taken over or hacked, the whole system goes down.
[00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.470]  But it's not going to be the Russians that do it.
[00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.470]  It's going to be the globalists that do it.
[00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:16.470]  The key is debanking people.
[00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.470]  But right now they debank us all the time.
[00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:19.470]  We've been debanked.
[00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:23.470]  We looked it up 10 times in the last 15 years for no reason.
[00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:24.470]  Just happened again.
[00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.470]  You saw it in AP last week.
[00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.470]  National story.
[00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.470]  We'd already figured that out.
[00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.470]  We're already moving.
[00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:33.470]  With this, it's all one system.
[00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:36.470]  It just turns you off, which they admit is the plan.
[00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.470]  Like, oh, it's so easy.
[00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.470]  Just go ahead and do it, mate.
[00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.470]  Crikey.
[00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.470]  Just take your shot.
[00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.470]  By the way, don't talk to your neighbors and don't look at the sunset.
[00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:52.470]  Stay in your house or we'll put you in a prison.
[00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.470]  All right.
[00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.470]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.470]  Crikey.
[00:42:55.470 --> 00:43:05.470]  My fellow patriots, the trifecta has not been in stock for years.
[00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:10.470]  Many of these products have been sold out for years, but we've not had all three of them
[00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:15.470]  at once together at Infowarsstore.com for 40% off.
[00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:20.470]  This is your best opportunity at the lowest price to support the broadcast, but more importantly,

[00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.470]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:42.470]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, read about these products, find out why they're so game-changing,

[00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.470]  on air.
[00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:03.470]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported Infowars financially and
[00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.470]  with word of mouth and prayer.
[00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:09.470]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists, the fact that we're not caught
[00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:13.470]  flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:16.470]  Your generosity has a real fighting chance.
[00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:20.470]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at Infowarsstore.com, like books, and films,
[00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:23.470]  and supplements, and water filtration, air filtration, and so much more.

[00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:47.470]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action
[00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:51.470]  now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the Great
[00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:56.470]  Reset by going to Infowarsstore.com and clicking on the Donate button and giving today.
[00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:58.470]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.470]  Please take action.
[00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:01.470]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.470]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.470]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:08.470]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.470]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:18.470]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with, and you do it with the highest
[00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:20.470]  quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:22.470]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.470]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:30.470]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.470]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:36.470]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time, 10% off on
[00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:42.470]  top of that exclusively at Infowarsstore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system
[00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.470]  in stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.470]  Get it today, and it funds the Infowar.
[00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:48.470]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:52.470]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists
[00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.470]  from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:58.470]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:03.470]  I'm going to say something obvious right now, but it's usually the obvious things that
[00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:05.470]  we all miss, including myself.
[00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:10.470]  Everybody seems very excited about the impeachment of Joe Biden, but remember, he is a totally
[00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:11.470]  complete puppet.
[00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:16.470]  It needs to be about the criminals that control him, the CIA, BlackRock, the multinational
[00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:17.470]  corporations.
[00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.470]  People want to blame Obama.
[00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.470]  Yeah, he's a bug bite, but he's still a puppet too.
[00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:26.470]  We need to make it about the power structure that's waging war against this country, that's
[00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:30.470]  de-industrializing us, attacking our culture, and creating race war.
[00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:35.470]  We need to make the impeachment all about the open borders, and the human trafficking,
[00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:40.470]  and the global government, and the UN taking control of our medical system.
[00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.470]  That's what we need to do.
[00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.470]  That's what we've got to stand for.
[00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:45.470]  That's what is going to bring down the system.
[00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:49.470]  If we just think about Biden, just about how horrible he is, an isopedophile, and how his
[00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:55.470]  son's a crackhead in gun charges, it becomes a distraction from the larger issues.
[00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:58.470]  We'll cover it all live at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:05.470]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:07.470]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:32.300]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., 3 p.m. Central, The Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.920]  But to protect your digital identity, of course,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.920]  make sure no bad people use the data against you,
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.920]  like Big Tech and the New World Order.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.920]  All the surveillance, all the censorship,
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.920]  all the election meddling, all the election stealing,
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.920]  all of that was a mere hors d'oeuvre, or prelude.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:18.920]  A simple first taste of what is now coming,
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:23.920]  roaring down the road at us at 5,000 miles an hour.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.920]  And China has been under it for seven hellish years,
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.920]  and the government's used it to crush their economy
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.920]  and shut down almost all the small businesses.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.920]  Even though it wrecked the nation's GDP,
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.920]  Xi Jinping calls it a victory because it consolidated
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:45.920]  the party's power, their power,
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.920]  their power over the little people,
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:54.920]  under mention, the subhumans, so that the uber mention,
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:50:00.920]  the supermen can rule over us, mere mortals,
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.920]  while they guinea pig the rest of us to find
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.920]  life extension technologies for themselves.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:12.920]  That's the Holy Grail, and the answer to it all,
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:16.920]  they want world government depopulation to rid us of their planet
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.920]  in their words, so they can enjoy the high tech
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.920]  life extension technologies, and what they believe
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.920]  will be immortality.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.920]  That is the brass ring, that is the goal,
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.920]  that is the Valhalla, that is the Nirvana,
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.920]  that is the heaven on earth they wish to build,
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.920]  but first the old world must be destroyed,
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:45.920]  and all of us, mere mortals, along with it.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.920]  You're afraid of death, you pretend you can become a god,
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.920]  the first act of a god they believe is to play god,
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.920]  and to decide who lives and who dies,
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.920]  and that is at the bottom of their mindset and who they are,
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:06.920]  and Tucker Carlson has now had a great awakening to this,
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.920]  has been giving powerful speeches on it,
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.920]  and very soon is going to be exposing it
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:19.920]  to its deepest depths, so look for that,
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.920]  don't think you'll have to wait long.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.920]  The new world order plays their games, we play ours,
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.920]  and no weapon formed against us shall prosper,
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.920]  if we give it to god, and have courage to take action.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.920]  Let's finish the clip, and they act like,
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.920]  oh Australia just came up with this,
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.920]  but New Zealand, and Canada, and Germany,
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.920]  and the EU, and Italy, they're all in China,
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.920]  and Singapore, and Nigeria,
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.920]  they're all under the IMF and World Bank,
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.920]  all rolling out the global digital currency,
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.920]  all standardized by the UN and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.920]  years ago all set up and prepared,
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.920]  if you research the global standardization for this,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.920]  it was developed and tested in China,
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.920]  in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.920]  the WEF and the UN, look it up,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.920]  look up Bill Gates helping standardize global ID,
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.920]  and global ESG, with BlackRock,
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.920]  and vaccine passports, and carbon taxes,
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.920]  and social credit scores, all on one lovely app,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.920]  and you'll get, don't worry, you'll get your paltry,
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.920]  universal basic income, and they've been saying for years,
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.920]  and now with tax exemption, building it in every major city
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.920]  of the western world, like Austin,
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.920]  250 square foot coffin apartments,
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.920]  well those it turns out are the luxury units,
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.920]  guys I forgot to play the clip Thursday or Friday,
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.920]  find it in the list, it's a little short newscast about,
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:55.920]  no, no, no, no, no, no, they're 45 square foot now,
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.920]  smaller than a maximum security jail cell,
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:04.920]  but they're trendy, and as long as they're liberal,
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.920]  you got a convicted pedophile dressed in a clown outfit,
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.920]  with little kids bouncing on their lap,
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.920]  it's okay if it's liberal,
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.920]  got massive humans smuggling at the border,
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.920]  little kids, it's okay as long as it's liberal,
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.920]  oh look, Bill Gates' curious plan to change the ID card,
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.920]  as we know it, oh with the UN and the Chinese,
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.920]  it's all standardized, look up,
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.920]  Bill Gates standardizing with Xi Jinping and the UN,
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.920]  the new global ID, how liberal,
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.920]  what a nice man,
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:42.920]  and he got 3.8 billion euros last year alone,
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.920]  in Germany to quote depopulate,
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.920]  how liberal, it's so liberal,
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.920]  and so Australia just came up with this standardized plan,
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.920]  it just fell off an apple tree,
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.920]  like Newton's apple and hit him right on the head,
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.920]  oh we'll just do this,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.920]  we just came up with this, here it is,
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:06.920]  right now you could be handing over lots of personal data anytime,
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.920]  you say sign up to a new phone plan,
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.920]  apply for a rental property or a new home loan,
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.920]  things like your passport, driver's license,
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.920]  Medicare details, your birth certificate,
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.920]  all then stored by multiple companies,
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.920]  if you choose to use a digital ID though,
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.920]  that information will be verified once but not stored,
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.920]  and it's all you'll need to prove who you are,
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.920]  By the way, we've looked up the Australian plan,
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.920]  it's the UN plan, it's the ESG,
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.920]  track everything you do, control your carbon tax,
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.920]  total lie, like they told you, the shots totally effective,
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.920]  you can't get COVID or can't spread it if you take the shot,
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.920]  and they just lied to you again,
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.920]  oh it's one time verified, nothing stored,
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.920]  sure and monkeys might fly out of my ass,
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.920]  pigs fly, continue.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:56.920]  You don't need to have my passport be sent to a rental estate agency,
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.920]  you don't need to have my full driving license sent,
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.920]  you just need to know that I am Andrew and I'm over 18 for example.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:07.920]  It's also not a revival of the controversial Australia card proposal from the 1980s.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.920]  No.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.920]  Is this like that?
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.920]  No, it's absolutely not like that,
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.920]  so it's not a new number or a new card or anything like that.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.920]  Still some people will be wary,
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.920]  so the system won't be mandatory,
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.920]  but that brings other concerns.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.920]  I'm genuinely worried that the Australian population
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.920]  from an aging population perspective is going to be left behind.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.920]  There are two more weeks of consultation.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.920]  The government hopes to have legislation before parliament
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.920]  by the end of the year.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.920]  Jane Azzapati, Nine News.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.920]  They're now saying nobody tried to make you take a shot or fired anybody,
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.920]  they just fired tens of millions around the world,
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.920]  including millions here,
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.920]  including hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.920]  We're going to 70,000 in New York alone, 71,000.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.920]  We're going to go to break.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.920]  Please remember, if you want to have a better life, empower yourself,
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:58.920]  and fund this operation, we have a trifecta, trifecta sale.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.920]  The trifecta sale of DNA Force Plus,
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.920]  Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and Real Red Pill,
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.920]  all three products game-changing, over-the-top,
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.920]  incredible for your entire body, you name it,
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.920]  just too many benefits to mention them here.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.920]  That sale has to end Wednesday, 40% off on all three.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.920]  That's the trifecta sale.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.920]  But talk about trifecta,
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:22.920]  we have Vitamin Mineral Fusion back in stock, discounted,
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.920]  all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the amino acids,
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.920]  the basis of everything you need,
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.920]  so all the other supplements and food you eat, water you drink,
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.920]  can then operate properly,
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.920]  because one deficiency can destroy the whole thing.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.920]  Essential means you die without it long-term.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.920]  This has everything essential in it,
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.920]  tastes great, very affordable,
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.920]  great for you old people, young people, you name it, back in stock.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.920]  So that's a second sale.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.920]  Say, how is it a trifecta, trifecta?

[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.920]  So it's a win-win.

[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.920]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:54.920]  that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available,
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.920]  and that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:58:59.920]  and the quality had gone down some.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.920]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us,
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:06.920]  but now we have brought back the coffee,
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:09.920]  and it's even better from a national supplier
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.920]  that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.920]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:20.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling,
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.920]  strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.920]  It is game-changing.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.920]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.920]  I know you're going to be hooked,
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.920]  which will then fund our operation, a 360 win.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:35.920]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now for Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:36.920]  That's the strongest.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.920]  The amazing Medium Roast Wake Up America.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.920]  And finally, the best-tasting Dark Roast Tip of the Spear,
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.920]  now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.920]  Get your coffee now.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.920]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.920]  First, they came for Alex Jones,
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:13.920]  and you did not speak out because you were not right-wing.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.920]  Then they came for the Tate brothers.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.920]  You did not speak out because you were not a Tate brother.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.920]  Then they came for Donald Trump.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.920]  You did not speak out because you were not a politician.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.920]  Then they came for Russell Brand.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.920]  You did not speak out because you are not a celebrity.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.920]  But next, they're going to come for you,
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.920]  and there will be nobody left to speak out.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.920]  If any of you out here have proof that 9-11 was an inside job
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.920]  or 9-11 was exactly as they said it was, I don't know.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.920]  What is interesting, one of the very few men on Earth I do trust,
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.920]  he said this two months before 9-11.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.920]  That if there is any terrorism, we know who to blame.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.920]  The point is, if any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.920]  And if there was an outside threat like bin Laden,
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.920]  who was a known CIS in the 80s running the Mujahideen War,
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.920]  whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now,
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.920]  this is the board of Iridium Satellite.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.920]  He's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.920]  I want the White House numbers up there now.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.920]  A big part of this solution, after you research all the government terrorism
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.920]  and check out what I'm saying is true, call the White House and tell them,
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.920]  we know the government's planning terrorism.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.920]  We know Oklahoma City and World Trade Center was terrorism.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.920]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners in Baltimore Sun.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.920]  If you do it, we're going to blame you because we know who's up to it.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.920]  Or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center,
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.920]  we know who to blame and you can save the planet.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.920]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.920]  on the World Trade Center.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:46.920]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.920]  where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.920]  into the World Trade Center.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.920]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now,
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.920]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.920]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.920]  I've been waiting for you, New World Order.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.920]  We meet again.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.920]  The circle is now complete.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.920]  Coming up, prestigious medical journal confirms 17 million killed by COVID vaccine.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.920]  Must watch, must share.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.920]  Global transmission.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.920]  This is your orders if you choose to accept it.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.920]  We're a volunteer army of humans battling the satanic New World Order.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.920]  All right.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.920]  We did a pretty good job last hour.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.920]  I got through three questions.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.920]  We did a pretty good job last hour.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.920]  I got through three stacks.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920]  We're going to go to break.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.920]  Join some stations that don't carry the first segment.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:03:02.920]  And I am going to get into this Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clip from Friday on C-SPAN
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.920]  because this isn't just the information he covered.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.920]  It's also the response of the Lemmings and how they counter things
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.920]  because they say it's scary what you're saying.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.920]  It's not true.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.920]  It's not true.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.920]  But it is true.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.920]  Everything Kennedy says about 5G and chemicals in the water
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:34.920]  and what it's doing to us and SSRIs directly tied on the insert, the damn label.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.920]  It's like gasoline says don't light a match near this.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.920]  It's on the side of the gas pump.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.920]  It's on the gas cans.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.920]  Like when you buy seven dust poison.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.920]  It says don't inhale or eat this.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.920]  It's got skull and crossbones on it.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.920]  Don't scare me.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.920]  Don't tell me that that could hurt me.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.920]  My government wouldn't do that to me.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.920]  My government's nice people.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:09.920]  So this is a small slice of documentation for what he said.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.920]  And so we're going to cover this when we come back.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.920]  And just imagine though when leftists that actually are so coddled
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:26.920]  and so delusional and so naive, they hear our shows
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:31.920]  and they haven't gone and researched Memorandum 200 from the State Department.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.920]  Henry Kissinger, they could.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.920]  It's really easy.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:40.920]  Just type in Henry Kissinger Memorandum 200 or 7277 for that matter or any of it.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.920]  I mean they don't read thousand-page books like eco-science.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.920]  They just think we're lying because you know what?
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.920]  It is scary.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.920]  It is.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.920]  And what's more scary is it's real.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.920]  But what's more scary than that is you staying in denial
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.920]  because they're going to kill your dumb ass.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:04.920]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.920]  because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.920]  And these are game-changing products.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.920]  It's like our information is game-changing.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.920]  These products are incredible.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.920]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.920]  All three of the Infowars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.920]  are now back in stock but a very limited run
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.920]  because we only had a budget to get 3,000 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.920]  We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.920]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:47.920]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of PainMD, an incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.920]  All three of these are back in stock, and they're incredible,
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.920]  and they fund our operation at infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:24.920]  As bad as things are, I think listeners tuning in today can tell,
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.920]  I am bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:33.920]  and I've got a little extra spring in my step and sparkle to my eye
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.920]  because humanity is awakening very quickly,
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.920]  and humanity's angry.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:51.920]  And the educational curve is parabolic, stratospheric, or straight up in its trajectory.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:59.920]  And I've calculated, like you calculate a hurricane's path,
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:04.920]  many, many, many permutations of where this is going,
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.920]  and it's not going in a good place for Billy Gates
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.920]  and Klausi Schwab and Lordy Rothschild and Kingy Charles
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.920]  and all the rest of their Hollywood devil-worshipping pedo-trash.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.920]  Yeah, the public's been mesmerized by Hollywood and all the distractions,
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.920]  but people are waking up and not accepting being poor
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.920]  and living in crime-ridden hellscapes because it's trendy.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.920]  And again, the awakening curve is great.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.920]  That's why they call it the Great Awakening is the answer to the Great Reset.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:50.920]  So, let's play this five-minute clip of RFK Jr. on C-SPAN,
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.920]  and this is the most common statement he gets,
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.920]  and it's the most common statement I get.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.920]  The most common thing I get, years ago it was I was a Russian agent,
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.920]  or it's leave those kids alone.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.920]  I'm like, really, who am I, what kids am I messing with?
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.920]  It's all just made-up media garbage.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.920]  People are like, you shouldn't have done that to those kids.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.920]  It's happened in front of my wife. It's happened in front of my security guys.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.920]  People will pull up at a gas station.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.920]  I can't believe you killed those kids.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.920]  I go, really, I'm Adam Lanza?
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.920]  You just hear Alex Jones, Alex Jones, mass shooting.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.920]  But now the most common thing is not that.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.920]  It's, why don't you stop scaring people?
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.920]  Why don't you stop making up all this crazy crap?
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:34.420]  I'm like, like what?
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:39.179]  That the frogs are gay with chemicals?
[01:08:39.179 --> 01:08:40.179]  That's a common one.
[01:08:40.179 --> 01:08:44.500]  Or that the planes are spraying poison on us.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:52.340]  I'm going to show you 50,000 documents, literally, under geoengineering, you know, Bill Gates,
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.340]  black out the sun.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.340]  Heard about that?
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:00.179]  Department of Energy, Nobel Prize, 1992, they launched the operation in 95.
[01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:02.639]  Now they're announcing it all over the news.
[01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:06.179]  So they admit they're chemtrailing us and doing all this with all these deadly chemicals,
[01:09:06.179 --> 01:09:10.580]  but then they separately say it doesn't exist.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.700]  Or that fluoride's good for you, hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.460]  Or that aspartame's good for you.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.460]  Type in.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:22.139]  UN says aspartame causes cancer and brain damage and heart attacks.
[01:09:22.139 --> 01:09:23.139]  It always did.
[01:09:23.139 --> 01:09:26.780]  They couldn't get it approved.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:38.740]  It's a bacteria excretion that they used to use to do all sorts of horrible chemical reactions
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.740]  with.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.740]  They're like, this tastes sweet.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.219]  When they gave it to monkeys in the 70s, it killed all of them.
[01:09:47.219 --> 01:09:48.219]  They still got it approved.
[01:09:48.219 --> 01:09:53.099]  You can't go to a grocery store and find non-aspartame gum or breath mints.
[01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:55.059]  You got to special order it online.
[01:09:55.059 --> 01:10:00.780]  Like, I want to come out with an aspartame-free gum.
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:06.299]  That's something that didn't have a big markup to it, but it's something everybody needs.
[01:10:06.299 --> 01:10:07.299]  It blows my mind.
[01:10:07.299 --> 01:10:10.540]  Blows my mind.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.900]  Blows my mind.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:16.299]  Sometimes I got to go give a speech or go somewhere, and I've eaten dinner and I got
[01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:20.900]  bad breath, and I'll take one for the team, and everybody got breath mints, and every one
[01:10:21.219 --> 01:10:22.219]  of them but Altoids.
[01:10:22.219 --> 01:10:23.219]  Nobody ever has Altoids.
[01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.219]  Has it, and I'll just go, ugh, and eat it.
[01:10:25.219 --> 01:10:30.540]  I get a headache an hour later, and I'm like, why did I do that?
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:33.460]  There's countless videos of me in a grocery store or gas station, I've put up probably
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:39.940]  10 of them over the years, where I'll see people buying their kids gum, Hubba Bubba,
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:40.940]  you name it.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:44.660]  Even if it's supposedly sugar gum, it has aspartame in it.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.420]  Bubbalicious, Big League Chew.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.420]  Didn't until about 10 years ago.
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:49.420]  Now it all has it.
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:55.980]  They're putting in thousands of products, and they put in a lot of medical medications,
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:11:00.780]  cough syrups, baby formulas.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:07.059]  They gave it to baby rhesus monkeys, killed all of them, the 1976 study.
[01:11:07.059 --> 01:11:13.059]  And I'll whip my camera out, a lot of you have seen these videos, and say, ma'am, sir,
[01:11:13.059 --> 01:11:17.019]  I don't mean to get in your business, but aspartame causes cancer and brain damage.
[01:11:17.019 --> 01:11:18.019]  You don't want to have that.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.900]  And a lot of times, they'll start laughing, or they'll say, oh, I didn't know that was
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.580]  in there, and they'll actually not get it, and then the clerk will be like, hey, mind
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.580]  your own business.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:27.500]  That's right, mind your own business when they're giving a kid.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:30.620]  I mean, if they were giving them Jack Daniels, I'd say, that's not good, but that's better
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.620]  than this.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:37.700]  Imagine if the mom opened Jack Daniels up in the grocery store, liquor store, and said,
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.900]  here, honey, they're a five-year-old, have some Jack Daniels.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.740]  They'll be like, whoa, we're calling child welfare, we're calling the police, stay right
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.340]  here, ma'am, that's illegal.
[01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:51.410]  It could be wintertime, and a mom will lock the kid in the car to run in 7-Eleven,
[01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:54.410]  and the people call the police, and wait here, and the cops come.
[01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:57.410]  That's illegal to leave your kid in the car, you know, for even two minutes.
[01:11:57.410 --> 01:12:01.410]  Which you shouldn't do, but the point is, hey, lady, that's, you know, it's like,
[01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.410]  somebody lets their five-year-old out of the house, they're playing in the road,
[01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:07.410]  and their kid gets taken. Yeah, you should be watching your kid, they shouldn't be playing in the road.
[01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:10.410]  I used to climb out the window when my mom was taking a nap and go play in the road.
[01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:12.410]  She deserved to have me taken.
[01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:16.410]  Everybody's real uppity when that's going on. Hey, you're a bad parent.
[01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:18.410]  But when it's Aspartame, guys, type in.
[01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:22.410]  UN says top sweetener or artificial sweetener linked to cancer or heart attacks.
[01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:24.410]  It's all over the news.
[01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:28.410]  I don't want to talk about something and not show people.
[01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:30.410]  That came out like three months ago.
[01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:32.410]  Type in Aspartame UN report.
[01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:37.410]  Of course, we already knew all that, or I'll pull it up.
[01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:38.410]  So, there it is.
[01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:44.410]  World Health Organization, WHO, Cancer Research Agency on Friday classified a commonly used artificial sweetener, Aspartame,
[01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:46.410]  as possibly carcinogenic to humans.
[01:12:46.410 --> 01:12:50.410]  No, it's mega bad.
[01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:52.410]  Mega bad. Mega bad.
[01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:57.410]  It killed the baby monkeys. Killed the baby monkeys. Killed the baby monkeys.
[01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:58.410]  Look it up.
[01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:05.410]  I probably had 50 doctors and scientists on over the last 29 years about it.
[01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:07.410]  It grows brain tumors worse than cell phones.
[01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:13.410]  And then here's RFK Jr.
[01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:14.410]  And there it is.
[01:13:14.410 --> 01:13:19.410]  Soda sweetener, Aspartame, now listed as possible cancer cause.
[01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:23.410]  Oh, but it's still safe.
[01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:29.410]  And what it is is it's highly addictive.
[01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:33.410]  It makes you more hungry in studies and makes you fatter.
[01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:40.410]  How many people you see weigh 400 pounds at the grocery store just shoveling Aspartame into their...
[01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:43.410]  Folks, one ingredient of it is wood alcohol.
[01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:47.410]  At 88 degrees, it breaks down into formaldehyde and wood alcohol.
[01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:51.770]  Remember wood alcohol? Why don't you drink wood alcohol?
[01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:53.770]  Because it makes you go blind.
[01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:58.770]  Oh, and aspartame is linked in dozens of studies I've seen to going blind.
[01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:03.770]  Degeneration of the optic nerve.
[01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:06.770]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:17.139]  Thousands of studies that 5G is way worse than the previous shell tower systems, way
[01:14:17.139 --> 01:14:22.780]  more powerful, absolute major lawsuits that are being won over it causing cancer.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.980]  Do they give a rat's behind?
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:24.980]  No, they love it.
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.380]  It's another way to slowly kill you from a thousand different angles.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.380]  I'm going to show you some of those documents, I mean, Wired Magazine six years ago, top
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:39.219]  scientists confirm 5G causes aggressive cancer, headline.
[01:14:39.219 --> 01:14:42.660]  They don't run those headlines now because the globalists have bought up all the mainstream
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:43.660]  corporate media.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.940]  They're lockstep with one feedback loop of information.
[01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:56.170]  Unbelievable.
[01:14:56.170 --> 01:15:03.010]  So let's go ahead and go to the clip of him and then I'm going to go through everything
[01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:09.290]  he talks about here and show you documents and studies and even mainstream news admitting
[01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:10.290]  it.
[01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:11.290]  Here it is.
[01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:17.770]  It's definitely not in my book or any of my democratic family or friend book, a Democrat.
[01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:22.010]  Your conspiracy theories, they literally scare us.
[01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:27.530]  We just came out of four years of, you know, full of, of Trump's lies and his conspiracy
[01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.530]  theories in this country.
[01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:36.170]  You claim that you want to heal us as a nation and our divide and this is not, I mean the
[01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:43.210]  wifi causes cancer and 5G is, is mass surveillance and chemicals in our water cause transgender
[01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:47.090]  and, and, and antidepressants cause school shootings.
[01:15:47.090 --> 01:15:52.370]  I, I'm so confused and so I'm looking for clarity from you today, Mr. Kennedy.
[01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:53.370]  Okay.
[01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:54.370]  Sharon, thank you for the call.
[01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:55.690]  You laid out a lot of things.
[01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:57.570]  We'll let Mr. Kennedy respond.
[01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:58.570]  Yeah.
[01:15:58.570 --> 01:16:00.810]  Sharon, thanks for those questions.
[01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:05.930]  You say that I have conspiracy theories and you know, you labeling me anti-vax, which
[01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:13.450]  I'm not, or a conspiracy theorist, which I am not, um, is one of the ways that the Democratic
[01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:18.370]  Party and their allied press have silenced me.
[01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:26.250]  I mean you, um, you mentioned for example, 5G and, and dismiss the fact that 5G causes
[01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:27.250]  cancer.
[01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:34.370]  I'm representing now hundreds of, of, of, of men and women in this country who have
[01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:43.210]  gotten a glioblastoma, a classic cell phone tumors, uh, from 5G and there's, there are
[01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:47.850]  reams of scientific studies that show that that is happening.
[01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:53.130]  Um, you, you say that 5G is not used for surveillance.
[01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:59.970]  Is there really any American left who believes that the government is not, uh, spying on
[01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:00.970]  the American people?
[01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:07.490]  You know, I mean, Edward Snowden demonstrated this, that I don't think you'll find a single
[01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:12.890]  member of Congress who if you ask them, does the government spy on Americans will tell
[01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:13.890]  you no.
[01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:17.650]  So I don't understand how that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:23.330]  I've never said that atrazine causes transgenderism.
[01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:24.690]  I've never said that.
[01:17:24.690 --> 01:17:30.250]  What I've said is that atrazine, and this is very well documented and anybody can look
[01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:39.530]  up these studies, um, that atrazine, when it is added to, uh, to water in which frogs in,
[01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:45.810]  in laboratories in which there are male frogs, in fact, one of the studies, they took 27
[01:17:45.810 --> 01:17:54.250]  male frogs, exposed them to atrazine, 90% of them were, um, uh, uh, were sterilized
[01:17:54.250 --> 01:18:03.130]  and 10% of the frogs became female and were able to produce, uh, fertile eggs.
[01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:05.690]  So it has that capacity.
[01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:10.090]  It's a, it's an endocrine disruptor, which, you know, I've been fighting endocrine disruptors
[01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:15.330]  my whole life and they, I don't think there's any scientific controversy that they, that
[01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:20.930]  they affect sexual development, PCBs, glyphosate, many, many others.
[01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.170]  It's very, very well documented.
[01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:29.890]  And I've said we should look at the chemical exposures to see what their impact is on public
[01:18:29.890 --> 01:18:35.930]  health, on depression, on endocrine disruptors, on the alteration.
[01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:42.690]  For example, why are our girls in this country demonstrably reaching puberty at much, much
[01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:45.810]  younger ages than they were a generation ago?
[01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:48.370]  Those are things that we should be looking at.
[01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:50.330]  And that's all I've said.
[01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:52.730]  And I don't think that's, I think that's common sense.
[01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:55.210]  I don't think you'd say that that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:56.210]  It's science-based.
[01:18:56.210 --> 01:19:00.490]  So, Mr. Kennedy, when you say it's science-based, exactly.
[01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:08.530]  Back it up to the, uh, C-SPAN dingbat, dum-dum.
[01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:13.530]  Everybody knows 5G can basically penetrate any house, any computer, if you're in range,
[01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:18.330]  and can brute force break into stuff, okay, because they put secretly, and it's come out
[01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:22.810]  decades ago, little transceivers in the chips, because the U.S. government already does
[01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:23.810]  it.
[01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:25.650]  They can fly over the airplane or park a truck.
[01:19:25.650 --> 01:19:30.450]  There's back doors where they can, even a computer that's not wired into the internet
[01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:36.370]  that is in a skiff, unless there's lead shielding in a Faraday cage, 5G technology breaks right
[01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:37.370]  into it.
[01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.370]  And it's for the driverless cars.
[01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:40.210]  It's got a lot of uses.
[01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.210]  It's very toxic.
[01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.210]  It's radiation.
[01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:43.210]  Electromagnetic microwaves, okay?
[01:19:43.210 --> 01:19:44.210]  And the guy's sitting there going, well, wait a minute, what's your proof?
[01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:45.210]  I mean, you say you got all this proof.
[01:19:45.210 --> 01:19:46.210]  I'm about to show you just a snapshot of it.
[01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:47.210]  It's literally, you could fill the Library of Congress with this.
[01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:48.210]  I mean, this is a fact.
[01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:49.210]  In World War II, they started noticing that if they walked right in front of the radars,
[01:19:49.210 --> 01:19:50.210]  they would get cancer in, like, a month.
[01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:51.210]  The first thing they would get was testicular, because it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's
[01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:52.210]  a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's
[01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:54.210]  treat cancer, right?
[01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:55.210]  Right?
[01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:56.210]  In the history of humanity, and in the memory of morality, and in the memory of imperfections,
[01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:57.210]  and in the memory of our actions and misdeeds, I will never be a fallen nation.
[01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:58.210]  I will not be a fallen nation.
[01:19:58.210 --> 01:19:59.210]  I don't understand why the world is, some of this nonsense that you're putting out always
[01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:00.210]  looks so tragically fascinating, and untrustworthy.
[01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:01.210]  It's very, very profitable.
[01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:02.210]  It's got a long history.
[01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:03.210]  It's good memory.
[01:20:03.210 --> 01:20:04.210]  It's a lot of happiness.
[01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:05.210]  It's not summary medicine.
[01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:06.210]  It's not important, you know?
[01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:07.210]  And I don't understand why, and I don't get, you know, it looks so tragic, and why doesn't
[01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:08.210]  this look...
[01:20:08.210 --> 01:20:09.210]  Did your dad watch World War II, really?
[01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:14.250]  outside the body would fry them. They would cook cans of beans by putting them
[01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:18.390]  in front of the radar dishes for like five minutes.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:24.440]  That's why when you see these radar installations, they wheel it out an installation, they've
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:30.840]  got a truck a hundred yards away because it'll kill your ass.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:36.440]  And they sit there and it'll cook a can of spam or beans and tell you it's good for you
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.200]  and they'll stick them on top schools and apartments.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.140]  I see apartments all over the world where they're putting 5G and all these other towers
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:44.140]  right on top of them.
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.140]  Yeah.
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.140]  Yeah.
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:47.140]  Yeah.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:48.140]  Yeah.
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:48.160]  Yeah.
[01:20:44.210 --> 01:20:50.250]  People's hair starts falling out, they got nosebleeds, they get cancer, and they wonder
[01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:51.730]  what the hell's going on.
[01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:56.490]  Live expectancy's dropping, and this person calls into the show and thinks he's making
[01:20:56.490 --> 01:21:00.850]  it up, and then listen to the Dumbo so-called host.
[01:21:00.850 --> 01:21:01.850]  Here it is.
[01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:07.530]  Mr. Kennedy, when you say it's science-based, then exactly what science are you basing it
[01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:11.170]  on, and have you put that proof out there on your website or wherever your campaign
[01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:16.330]  is at that information out there so people can look at it for themselves?
[01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:17.330]  Of course I have.
[01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:24.370]  You know, the scientific studies are listed on my website, and they're available to anybody.
[01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:35.730]  In fact, just go to Google and type in frogs exposed to adrazine and fertility, and you'll
[01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:39.690]  see the scientific study, peer-reviewed science.
[01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:43.410]  This isn't something that's obscure or hidden.
[01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:45.050]  Anybody can look these studies up.
[01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:46.050]  Pause again.
[01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:47.050]  It doesn't-
[01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:48.050]  Back in about five seconds.
[01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:51.090]  It's obscure or hidden.
[01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:56.050]  When I go through all this, I'm going to then play you geoengineering, aka, in common vernacular,
[01:21:56.050 --> 01:22:02.570]  chemtrails, and you can just look at geoengineering, and they're spraying all these poisonous isotopes
[01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:08.770]  on you that microscopic amounts will ruin your life, fry your brain, kill trees, kill insects.
[01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:09.850]  What's collapsing?
[01:22:09.850 --> 01:22:15.090]  The trees, the insects, they're literally murdering everything, and it's a giant Department
[01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:16.730]  of Energy Pentagon program.
[01:22:16.730 --> 01:22:20.130]  The officers all know full well what they're part of.
[01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:23.670]  The Doppler radar is 10 times more powerful than it's supposed to be because they use
[01:22:23.670 --> 01:22:26.490]  that to control these aerosols.
[01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:30.290]  It's got a bunch of different uses for over-the-horizon radar.
[01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:35.650]  I was told that by General Benton K. Barton 20-something years ago.
[01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:36.650]  You know how I know?
[01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:39.450]  He was the commander of HAARP for a while in Alaska.
[01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:43.330]  He was the commander of all new Air Force weapons, and he could talk about it because
[01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:44.330]  that part was declassified.
[01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:50.990]  He said, yes, Alex, it's for over-the-horizon radar.
[01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:54.970]  That's one use.
[01:22:54.970 --> 01:23:02.210]  So they can go over the curve of the earth with this radar because they electrify, ionize
[01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.150]  the upper atmosphere.
[01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:05.970]  So then it's conductive to get the message.
[01:23:05.970 --> 01:23:07.410]  It's like a whale song.
[01:23:07.410 --> 01:23:19.010]  A whale can hear another whale at 400, 500 miles away just whistling.
[01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:21.130]  I'm coming down from Alaska to Hawaii.
[01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:22.130]  I want a mate.
[01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:28.370]  Well, it's the same thing with this.
[01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:33.370]  Electrify the atmosphere and then have sensors bouncing it, picking it up.
[01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:36.210]  That's what they told them it was for because it has that use, too.
[01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:39.370]  And they can do weather control with it and have the head of HAARP on.
[01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:42.170]  They can ignite the atmosphere, he said on the show.
[01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:44.650]  But I'm digressing.
[01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:47.690]  The point is I have the CIA director admitting it's operational.
[01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:50.130]  I have the U.N. treaties that it's operational.
[01:23:50.130 --> 01:24:00.010]  Type in U.N. treaty on weather weapons, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1984, 1992, 2000, 2004.
[01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:01.690]  I mean, you think I'm joking?
[01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:02.690]  Look it up.
[01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:07.250]  And then they sit there and go, you crazy people, there's no weather control.
[01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:08.890]  There's nothing going on.
[01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:09.890]  There's nothing happening.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:14.020]  But the whales aren't hurting anybody. They're just saying,
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.020]  Hey, I'm looking for a girlfriend.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:24.020]  But our little buddies, they're doing something a little different.
[01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:31.030]  The same Pentagon and Operation Fishbowl in the early 60s
[01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:34.030]  detonated hundreds of hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere,
[01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:37.030]  quote, trying to catch the atmosphere on fire.
[01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:41.030]  They thought there was a good chance it might destroy the Earth, but they still did it.
[01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:46.030]  That's in Trinity and Beyond, from the Discovery Channel in the 90s,
[01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:51.030]  narrated by Captain Kirk.
[01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:55.030]  Of course, you know him by his actual name, William Shatner.
[01:24:56.030 --> 01:25:00.030]  That's what's so frustrating, folks, is that...
[01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:03.030]  I'm digressing. I've got to get to the documents.
[01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:05.030]  Go back to the clip.
[01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:09.030]  Anybody can look these studies up.
[01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:12.030]  It's not rocket science.
[01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:15.030]  But, you know, there's also...
[01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:19.030]  There are literally thousands and thousands of studies
[01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:23.030]  that talk about endocrine disruptors and warnings.
[01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:30.030]  In fact, plastics and BPA in plastics is an endocrine disruptor.
[01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:33.030]  So we're exposed to these all the time.
[01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:39.030]  There are alterations that are happening in sexual development in young Americans.
[01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:42.030]  I don't think anybody disputes that.
[01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:45.030]  And the science is out there.
[01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:50.030]  I mean, one of the great scientists on this is Dr. David Carpenter.
[01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:55.030]  And you can look up his studies and go track his interviews.
[01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:58.030]  But this isn't a theory.
[01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:03.030]  This is something that's peer-reviewed and very well-known.
[01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:07.030]  The reporter's like, where are you getting all this?
[01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:09.030]  I don't know. Kennedy's like,
[01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:12.030]  I just filed and won hundreds of famous lawsuits on endocrine disruptors.
[01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:15.030]  We've just filed lawsuits. We're winning on 5G.
[01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:17.030]  I mean, what do you know about this?
[01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:20.030]  He's just America's most famous real environmentalist.
[01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:22.030]  Doesn't mean I agree with everything he says, but, you know, like,
[01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:24.030]  hey, let's not dump toxic waste in the ocean.
[01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:26.030]  Let's not dump plastic in the ocean.
[01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:30.030]  Let's not have 5G radiation frying our children and us.
[01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:36.030]  You know, I've got right here, Wired Magazine and the Rat Studies,
[01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:39.030]  a decade ago on 5G, was recommended it not be rolled out.
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:43.940]  Because it gives you cancer, folks.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:45.940]  But hey!
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:50.240]  I guess it's alright, huh?
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:55.480]  So let's look at this folder, it's a yellow folder, RFK Jr. clip, we're gonna look at 5G
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.800]  and cancer, 5G and surveillance, gay frogs, early puberty, you know girls as young as
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:06.040]  three are going into puberty, now the new age is 9, used to be 12, SSRIs and violence,
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:11.560]  it's on the inserts of Prozac and all the SSRIs that it's linked directly to, megalomania,
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.720]  suicide and mass murder.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.640]  But you know, that's the insert, you know, she wants to see some proof, I mean, it's
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.800]  on the label, lady, I don't know what more proof you need, it's like you take her to
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:27.340]  Home Depot and you're like, hey, I wouldn't, you know, not wear gloves when you use this
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:30.920]  poison over here, she's like, what do you mean?
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:34.920]  Don't try to scare me, and you're like, it says right there, don't touch this, wear gloves
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.920]  and wear a respirator, see, it's got a skull and crossbones, that means death.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:44.360]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.920]  We'll go to break and we're going to come back and hit all this, then we're going to
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:54.680]  get into, they've officially are rolling out for major stores and they're trying to pass
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:59.280]  regulations that won't be labeled, just like four years ago it began, GMO salmon that's
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:07.960]  part insect is now being sold in stores nationwide and they don't tell you it is a chimeric abomination
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.480]  in major studies that it causes toxic effects in the body.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:17.920]  So you will eat the bugs because they're splicing bugs into the salmon.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:22.820]  You heard me right, boys and girls, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:28.480]  So when we go to break, which is 30 seconds away, we're going to come back and go to this
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.840]  for the Dumbos out there.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.840]  This is too scary.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.560]  I just, I've got somebody to lock that guy up all over Twitter, Facebook, just arrest
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:41.320]  Jones, arrest him, kill him, get him, how dare him?
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.320]  How dare Robert Kennedy Jr.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:50.320]  Try to scare us, these fear porn mongers, give me a drink of cyanide, they say it's
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:54.320]  poisonous, I think it's good for you, let me pour some gasoline on myself and light it,
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.320]  they claim it'll burn me, that's a lie.

[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:04.320]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:10.320]  or the GMO crops. They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:16.320]  companies and industry to use. One of the top pesticides used is atrazine. The allowable
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:20.320]  level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:27.320]  you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant. Look it up. Don't let them do this
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:32.320]  to your family. We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there. Highest rated at

[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:06.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:26.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, you are listening to Alex
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:04.300]  And then they would go convince the owners, we got to move this.
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:09.960]  That's why they stick the towers off way away from people, because that's the moral thing
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.960]  to do.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.120]  Again, it takes a voice, sends it out over a wavelength, and you can be listening a thousand
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:18.600]  miles away to an AM radio station.
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.280]  That's powerful, folks.
[01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:25.310]  Now, if you've got a one-watt FM transmitter in your house,
[01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:27.310]  I've talked to the engineers.
[01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:28.310]  They're doing nothing.
[01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:30.310]  It's not really hurting you.
[01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:34.310]  But if you don't mean to be gross, had a surgery,
[01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:36.310]  and had it embedded in your body,
[01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:38.310]  after a few years, at point-blank range,
[01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:39.310]  you'd probably get cancer.
[01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:40.310]  That's what the engineers have told me.
[01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:44.310]  But because it's sticking up on the top of your house or whatever,
[01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:47.310]  and it's only one watt, no issue.
[01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:52.310]  But we are just completely surrounded by it.
[01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:56.310]  These cell phones are microwave relay systems.
[01:37:56.310 --> 01:38:00.310]  And how many studies are there on the massive increase in brain tumors?
[01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:02.310]  Directly confirmed in lawsuits won.
[01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:06.310]  France just banned the new iPhones because they're so much stronger
[01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:07.310]  than regular cell phones.
[01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:09.310]  They said, well, we'll accept these systems.
[01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:12.310]  Sure, they cause cancer, but not the new iPhones.
[01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:17.310]  Banned in France because they're five times stronger
[01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:20.310]  than any other cell phone they've seen.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:25.120]  Evidence for high risk of RF on humans
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:28.120]  living around mobile phone base stations
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.120]  from radiofrequency sickness to cancer.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:32.120]  Peer-reviewed studies.
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:33.120]  But that's enough.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.120]  Let's just get into the issues he raised.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:37.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, overhead shot please.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.120]  Here's the InfoWars article with Kennedy in it.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.120]  We're later going to embed this video in the article
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.120]  and repost it tomorrow.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.120]  Now, health risks from radiofrequency radiation
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:49.120]  including 5G should be assessed by experts
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.120]  with no conflict of interest.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.120]  That's the NIH, the federal government.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.120]  Well, we got Wired Magazine, the big study.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.120]  It causes cancer.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.120]  Do cell phones cause cancer?
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.120]  Cell phones and cancer.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.120]  Cell phone radiation associated with brain tumor rates are rising.
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:10.120]  Scientific documentation, the EHtrust.org.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:14.120]  5G is here and still vulnerable to stingray surveillance.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:17.120]  So he says 5G is not surveilling.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:23.120]  5G shortcut leaves phones exposed to stingray surveillance.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.120]  Wired Magazine.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:27.120]  The terrifying potential of the 5G network.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.120]  New Yorker.
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:30.120]  How it surveils you, how it hurts you, all of it.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:36.120]  The whole capital is just like a giant radioactive command base.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:39.120]  When 5G and video surveillance met in a smart city,
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.120]  it controls the drones, it controls the driverless cars,
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.120]  it's the grid for their takeover.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:46.120]  Cities-today.com.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.120]  And 5G used for surveillance radar.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.120]  U.S. military funds research.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.120]  Of course it is.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.120]  Edward Snowden discloses U.S. government operations
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.120]  and what they're doing using these systems.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:00.120]  NSA surveillance exposed by Snowden ruled unlawful.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.120]  NSA surveillance exposed by Snowden was illegal.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.120]  Court rules.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:08.120]  But the person calling in says there's no surveillance happening.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:11.120]  And these articles, they just printed up quick this morning when I said get some.
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:14.120]  This is nothing because they've hidden it on Google.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:17.120]  So go like duck, duck, go, and it's not even perfect.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:20.120]  And just type in Wired Magazine Cancer 5G.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.120]  That's the best report.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.120]  Here's one.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.120]  News.berkeley.edu.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.120]  Pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:32.120]  Makes them want to have sex with males, plunges their population.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:34.120]  Weed killer makes male frogs lay eggs.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:38.120]  National Geographic.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:42.120]  A common herbicide turns some male frogs into females.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.120]  Atrazine induces complete feminization
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:48.120]  and chemical castration in male African clawed frogs.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:53.120]  Almost all of them become femaleized, but only 10% totally convert,
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.120]  depending on the species.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.120]  Here's some of the big giant studies.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.120]  Hermaphroditic demasculation of frogs after exposure to herbicide atrazine
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.120]  at low ecological relevant doses that the U.S. government says is legal.
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.120]  Major study.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.120]  Researcher.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.120]  This is NPR.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.120]  Pesticides castrates male frogs.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:18.120]  I'm going to stop here for a minute.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:24.120]  Have you looked around at the young men?
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.120]  I mean, I'm not as masculine as my grandfathers,
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.120]  and almost all the young men don't look masculine.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.120]  They look like chicken necks.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.120]  And then statistically, their sperm count is 90% lower.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:40.120]  Penises in the womb don't develop, and penis size is smaller.
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.120]  And then every time I mention that, they'll have news articles all over,
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.120]  making fun of me.
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:48.120]  Oh, Alex Jones and the shrinking penis conspiracy.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:51.120]  Girls are going through puberty earlier than ever before
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:54.120]  with long-lasting health effects.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.120]  Science alert.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:58.120]  Yeah, it makes them age faster.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:01.120]  Why are girls starting puberty earlier?
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:04.120]  U.S. News and World Report.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.120]  Why more and more girls are hitting puberty earlier?
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.120]  Girls reaching puberty earlier and getting all these cancers.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:13.120]  Puberty starts earlier than it used to.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.120]  No one knows.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.120]  Oh, really?
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.120]  No, we do know.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.120]  New York Times.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.120]  Uncomfortable truth.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:24.120]  Does the rise of antidepressants and SRIs fuel mass shootings?
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.120]  Psychiatry.org.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:29.120]  It's on the insert.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:30.120]  It's like asking,
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:35.120]  If tying a rope around your neck and hanging yourself kill you.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:38.120]  Select serotonin reuptake inhibitors in violent crime.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.120]  A cohort study.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.120]  You're in the break, guys.
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.120]  Pull up SSRI.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.120]  Drug inserts warn.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.120]  Suicide warning.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:52.120]  Mental Health Watchdog releases new report on link between psychiatric drugs
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.120]  and school mass shootings.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.120]  Here's the big study.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:56.120]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.120]  Stay with us.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.120]  InfoWars.com.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:00.120]  Bodies is back.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:04.120]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfoWars.com
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:07.120]  and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.120]  Utilized for thousands of years,
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:13.120]  turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:21.120]  on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:23.120]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body,
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.120]  help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility,
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:31.120]  assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:37.120]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1 to 5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:43.120]  but our super powerful extract using Bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.120]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.120]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.

[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:34.120]  that's been sold for many years that people love

[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:10.120]  the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:13.120]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:04.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.120]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:16.120]  Well, I'm on record decades ago saying they're going to try to ban meat
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:18.120]  and make you eat bug protein.
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:21.120]  It's very poisonous. It causes cancer, the chitin.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.120]  Now, all over the world, they're putting it into flour,
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.120]  into other products, and rolling it out.
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:29.120]  It's the same thing.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:30.120]  It's the same thing.
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:31.120]  It's the same thing.
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:32.120]  It's the same thing.
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:33.120]  It's the same thing.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:36.120]  It's flour into other products and rolling it out
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.120]  with new codes that don't even tell you it's bugs.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:44.120]  People are poising the hell out of us from a thousand different angles.
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:48.120]  And now here in the US, they're authorizing it for sale.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.120]  Lab-grown so-called chicken, here it is.
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:01.120]  Finland has made bread that's made out of crickets.
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:05.120]  Oh, it's so good for you.
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:08.120]  Oh, but it saves the Earth.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.120]  It saves the Earth.
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:15.120]  The future, we'll all eat bugs.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:18.120]  They require much less feed than traditional meats.
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:21.120]  They also require much less land.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:24.120]  If we replace half the animals, of course we'll be all of them when they're done,
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.120]  we'll save the Earth.
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:29.120]  We'd feed up to an area 70 times the size of the UK.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:32.120]  We'd also sustainably reduce emissions.
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:35.120]  Do you eat a loaf of cricket bread?
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:38.120]  Oh, World Economic Forum.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:43.120]  For the first time, U.S. regulators approved the sale of chicken made from animal cells.
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:49.120]  It allows two California companies to offer lab-grown meat to restaurants.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:54.120]  The cultivated meat is grown in steel tanks using cells that come from a living animal,
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:59.120]  a fertilized egg, or a special bank of stored cells.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:02.120]  It feels strange and a little peculiar initially,
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:07.120]  but after a period of time, it becomes ubiquitous and boring,
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  and that's eventually the path for cultivated meat.
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.120]  Okay, but don't look for it at grocery stores anytime soon.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.120]  Cultivated chicken is apparently much more expensive
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.120]  and cannot yet be produced on the scale of traditional meats.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.120]  I'm trying it.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.120]  For all the other things we eat.
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:28.120]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:30.120]  By the way, I have a Bill Gates article, mainstream news.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:35.120]  They said they're going to spray mRNA particles on you, whether you like it or not, to protect you.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.120]  And of course, Bill Gates is the main guy behind this with the UN.
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:42.120]  They're going to put lots of good things into that GMO meat.
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:46.120]  They put a little bit of chicken cell in with a little bit of Henrietta Lacks,
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:51.120]  super fast-growing tumor cells, and they just a whole vat of chicken.
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.120]  But it's not chicken.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.120]  And then you eat that.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.120]  Even though it turns your stomach and you know it's evil and bad,
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.120]  and it's their pretext to get rid of all the regular meat,
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:04.120]  because it's bad to have cows eating grass because they put off methane,
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:06.120]  even though that's part of the atmosphere.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:07.120]  That's not natural.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:08.120]  You are the carbon.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.120]  I am the carbon.
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:11.120]  They want to reduce.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:13.120]  The carbon is part of the planet.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:14.120]  It's the cycle.
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:15.120]  It's good.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.120]  Let's go back to backing up RFK Jr.
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:20.120]  I'm going to shift gears to all this other news next hour.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:23.120]  Wire Magazine, 5G smartphones cause cancer.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:26.120]  Big wireless doesn't want you to know.
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:35.120]  That's 2016, back before they totally controlled all the media.
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.120]  The FDA black box warning on antidepressant suicide risk in young adults.
[01:50:40.610 --> 01:50:44.610]  Oh, that's from the NIH, National Institutes of Health,
[01:50:44.610 --> 01:50:49.610]  saying it's on the insert that it causes suicide and mass murder.
[01:50:49.610 --> 01:50:52.610]  But you heard her say, how dare you say that to R.L.K. Jr.
[01:50:52.610 --> 01:50:57.610]  Suicidality in children and adolescents being treated with antidepressant medications.
[01:50:57.610 --> 01:51:01.610]  FDA.gov. It's a fact.
[01:51:01.610 --> 01:51:06.610]  Like the U.N. said, oh, aspartame gives you cancer and heart attacks, but it's okay.
[01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:10.610]  Antidepressant black box warning 10 years later.
[01:51:10.610 --> 01:51:13.610]  So I'm done talking about that.
[01:51:13.610 --> 01:51:20.610]  We just spent 45 minutes or more responding to that caller.
[01:51:20.610 --> 01:51:24.610]  Probably a real person, probably not just a seminar caller told to say it.
[01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:26.610]  And they just think we're scaring people.
[01:51:26.610 --> 01:51:28.610]  We're bad.
[01:51:28.610 --> 01:51:32.610]  So I just responded to them.
[01:51:32.610 --> 01:51:37.610]  Oh, I've got videos of the head of the EU saying they're going to try to control
[01:51:37.610 --> 01:51:40.610]  every facet of your life with the new central bank digital currencies,
[01:51:40.610 --> 01:51:45.610]  but I have them publicly saying they won't.
[01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:46.610]  Yeah, we'll be getting to that.
[01:51:46.610 --> 01:51:50.610]  We'll be getting to so much more.
[01:51:50.610 --> 01:51:53.610]  Next hour, World War III, the election, the persecution of Trump,
[01:51:53.610 --> 01:51:56.610]  the Democrat congressman pulling the fire alarm,
[01:51:56.610 --> 01:52:01.610]  WEF caught orchestrating U.S. border crisis for military bases in Panama,
[01:52:01.610 --> 01:52:09.610]  geoengineering, and, of course, this bombshell.
[01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:11.610]  It's all about depopulation.
[01:52:11.610 --> 01:52:13.610]  We're going to hit this first.
[01:52:13.610 --> 01:52:22.610]  Another prestigious medical journal comes out and says, yeah,
[01:52:23.610 --> 01:52:35.610]  shots have killed, we estimate, 17 million people.
[01:52:35.610 --> 01:52:36.610]  But that's okay.
[01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:40.610]  The U.N. prosecutor, now half his office is made up of former U.N. prosecutors.
[01:52:40.610 --> 01:52:42.610]  They'll show us who the boss is.
[01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:43.610]  They're going to invade with blue helmets.
[01:52:43.610 --> 01:52:48.610]  They're going to take over our banking and take over our food and cut off our energy.
[01:52:48.610 --> 01:52:55.610]  Old Jack Smith's not too worried about 5G or 17 million dead from the shots.
[01:52:55.610 --> 01:52:57.610]  No, he's worried about Trump.
[01:52:57.610 --> 01:53:00.610]  Got to stop him, yeah.
[01:53:00.610 --> 01:53:06.610]  Bombshell report, COVID vaccine's causality linked to an increased mortality
[01:53:06.610 --> 01:53:08.610]  resulting in 17 million deaths.
[01:53:08.610 --> 01:53:12.610]  Here's the actual prestigious study.
[01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:14.610]  Of course, mandates alive and well.
[01:53:14.610 --> 01:53:16.610]  Texas College imposes COVID vaccine mandates.
[01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:20.610]  Baylor has for students and faculty.
[01:53:20.610 --> 01:53:22.610]  British Columbia is announcing remasking going in.
[01:53:22.610 --> 01:53:26.610]  I got a TV newscast on that.
[01:53:26.610 --> 01:53:31.610]  But I talked to my source a week ago, and they said, yeah, no, they told us the 15th.
[01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:36.610]  They were going to bring back masks for the TSA, but we never got the memo, and they didn't.
[01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:38.610]  But you saw everything else roll out.
[01:53:38.610 --> 01:53:41.610]  So I believe because we did that, they didn't want to validate us.
[01:53:41.610 --> 01:53:42.610]  That shows the power.
[01:53:42.610 --> 01:53:43.610]  They didn't want us to get ahead of them.
[01:53:44.610 --> 01:53:46.610]  But everything else is rolling out.
[01:53:46.610 --> 01:53:51.610]  So we've got a lot on that front.
[01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:55.610]  But I did fly recently, and a lot of folks are wearing the mask at the TSA.
[01:53:55.610 --> 01:53:58.610]  So people at the stores are wearing them again.
[01:53:58.610 --> 01:53:59.610]  It's everywhere.
[01:53:59.610 --> 01:54:03.610]  So they're trying to do a soft launch, but people aren't buying it.
[01:54:03.610 --> 01:54:08.610]  We'll talk more about what type of trigger systems they may use to bring in a new virus or a new variant.
[01:54:08.610 --> 01:54:11.610]  They've already tried that, but it's not working.
[01:54:11.610 --> 01:54:15.610]  So will they release something even nastier?
[01:54:15.610 --> 01:54:22.610]  And then I've got all these clips from Sky News in Australia, England, Newsmax here,
[01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:27.610]  and, man, do they sound identical to Alex Jones.
[01:54:27.610 --> 01:54:33.610]  And that's real victory, folks, because once somebody sees it, once somebody gets it,
[01:54:33.610 --> 01:54:37.610]  once somebody's aware of it, there's no going back.
[01:54:37.610 --> 01:54:47.610]  So get me the NFL tight end pushing Pfizer stuff for money, and also Mr. T.
[01:54:47.610 --> 01:54:49.610]  Hope it doesn't go the way of Hank Aaron.
[01:54:49.610 --> 01:54:50.610]  Tell everybody to take their shots.
[01:54:50.610 --> 01:54:53.610]  That's coming up next hour as well.
[01:54:53.610 --> 01:54:56.610]  You know, I said I was going to take calls today, and I want to take calls.
[01:54:56.610 --> 01:55:00.610]  But I also feel good that I've covered.
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:07.860]  I've covered about 30% of the news so far.
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:10.860]  I think today may be the day.
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:12.860]  You know what, I'm not going to take calls today.
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:14.860]  I'll take calls tomorrow.
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:17.860]  I'm going to continue on well into the fourth hour,
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:20.860]  when our guest host takes over,
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:23.860]  and I'm going to cover all of it,
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:27.860]  because it's all incredibly important and needs to be heard.
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:30.860]  Putin's closest ally warns of World War III.
[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:31.860]  A U.K. troop just entered Ukraine.
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:34.860]  The U.K. says they're sending them.
[01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:39.860]  There is so much coming up next hour.
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:42.860]  Now, let me give everybody some really good news.

[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:06.860]  Well, most people thought about a week or so,
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:08.860]  but for everybody, on average, a little more than a week.
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:10.860]  It's back.

[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:33.860]  But also, these are really amazing products.
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:35.860]  Nitric Boost is incredible for cleaning out your blood

[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:50.860]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:53.860]  in years because of supply chain breakdowns
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:55.860]  and all the rest of the stuff that's gone on.
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:57.860]  And these are game-changing products.
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:59.860]  It's like our information is game-changing.
[01:57:59.860 --> 01:58:01.860]  These products are incredible.
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:04.860]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:08.860]  All three of the Infowars Platinum flagship products
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:11.860]  that have been sold out for months are now back in stock
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:16.860]  but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:19.860]  3,000 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:24.860]  We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:29.860]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.

[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:39.860]  All three of these are back in stock, and they're incredible,
[01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:43.860]  and they fund our operation at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:12.860]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body,

[01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:17.860]  increase mobility, assist in joint function,
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:20.860]  bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:23.860]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1 to 5%
[01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:25.860]  of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:28.860]  but our super-powerful extract using bodies
[01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:32.860]  contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:35.860]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:38.860]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test,
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:39.860]  then look no further.

[01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:55.860]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:55.860 --> 02:00:08.860]  All right, I want to air a clip from a 1985 popular talk show
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:12.860]  where doctors warned patients that vaccines don't work
[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:14.860]  and cause autoimmune diseases.
[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:17.860]  I worked for two veterinarians, small animal and large animal,
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:20.860]  back when I was in high school, and they both knew
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:22.860]  the vaccine schedule for dogs and cats was killing them
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:24.860]  and would quietly tell people not to do it.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:27.860]  Let's go to that clip.
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:31.860]  It's just that I think the public needs to be informed.
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:35.860]  We need to be told the benefits versus the risks.
[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:37.860]  We need to know what we're facing.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:39.860]  Well, the doctor's side of the polio vaccine,
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:42.860]  and what nobody knows, is that Jonas Salk has pointed out
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:44.860]  that in the last 10 years in this country,
[02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:48.860]  two-thirds of all the cases of polio have been vaccine-induced.
[02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:50.860]  How many cases is that, Bob?
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:52.860]  How many cases, Bob?
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:55.860]  Would you not interrupt me for a second?
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:58.860]  I know that doctors are used to interrupting patients,
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:00.860]  but not another doctor.
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:08.860]  I think, but let's get...
[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:11.860]  He does make a point that we should also say
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:14.860]  Saban is live and the live vaccine in Salk is...
[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:15.860]  Is inactive.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:18.860]  Is inactive, as we say in the laboratory.
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:20.860]  How many was it, they ask?
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:25.860]  Well, how many people know that the European epidemic of polio,
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:28.860]  there were about 20 or 30 cases in this country.
[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:31.860]  Now, of course, the American doctors will argue
[02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:33.860]  that the reason why polio disappeared in this country
[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:35.860]  was because of the vaccine.
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:39.860]  But then why did it disappear in Europe in the 1940s and the 1950s
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:41.860]  without mass vaccination?
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:43.860]  Why doesn't it occur in the third world
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:45.860]  where only 10% of the people have ever been immunized
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:47.860]  against polio or anything else?
[02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:50.860]  So, in other words, we may be fighting a tiger that died.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:51.860]  That's quite correct.
[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:53.860]  Ask the people in Great Britain.
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:56.860]  Ask the people in Japan who...
[02:01:58.860 --> 02:01:59.860]  Gentlemen, if you please,
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:02.860]  I've got probably the smartest audience we've ever had.
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.860]  I have a question.
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:07.860]  How long a delayed action, if any,
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:10.860]  would you connect this with, like MS?
[02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:14.860]  Is MS a possibility?
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:17.860]  Would multiple sclerosis be one of the possible results?
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:20.860]  As a matter of fact, there's a new publication
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:22.860]  that just came out from John Hoffman,
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:24.860]  who's a close associate of Tony Morris',
[02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:28.860]  that gives the references linking MS in later life
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:32.860]  to the early introduction of live virus vaccines
[02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:37.860]  like measles and like some of the others that are live viruses.
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:41.860]  Now, at the present time, I would recommend
[02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:45.860]  that anybody who has MS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:49.860]  or any of those degenerative neurologic conditions of later life
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:52.860]  carefully review their vaccine histories.
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:55.860]  I would also like to comment to that
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:57.860]  because in connection with my case, I've been doing some research.
[02:02:57.860 --> 02:02:59.860]  Let me tell them once again, Ms. Gundy,
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:01.860]  that you're a Guillain-Barre victim
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:06.860]  contracted following your receipt of the swine flu vaccination.
[02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:10.860]  Yes, and I am in the process of writing a book about my experience
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:13.860]  and in the process I've done considerable research.
[02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:15.860]  And from what I have learned,
[02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:19.860]  it looks as if immunizations frequently cause autoimmune diseases,
[02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:23.860]  not only Guillain-Barre syndrome, but lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:25.860]  multiple sclerosis, and other types of things.
[02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:27.860]  Now, I have no data at this point.
[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:30.860]  We should also say that there's a good deal of evidence
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:34.860]  suggesting that multiple sclerosis may be the result of distemper
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:37.860]  in an animal that the victim received during childhood.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:41.860]  None of this is absolutely nailed to the wall.
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:43.860]  But that's the problem with this.
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:47.860]  What's a mother to do with all of these balls in the air
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:50.860]  and nobody really certain?
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:53.860]  I would just like to also comment that we had 46 million people
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:56.860]  vaccinated with the swine flu shot.
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:58.860]  And I have written to Ralph Nader's organization.
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:00.860]  I have written to some of the government organizations
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:03.860]  trying to get them to do a survey, an ongoing survey,
[02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:07.860]  to see if these vaccinations do cause autoimmune diseases
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:09.860]  or what the reactions are.
[02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:11.860]  I can't even get a response because I'm not a doctor.
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:13.860]  I have no clout. I'm a nobody.
[02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:15.860]  Mrs. Grant, why were you shaking your head?
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:18.860]  Bill, it is not with that vaccine. It's with all vaccines.
[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:20.860]  They are not interested in the adverse reactions.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:23.860]  As a matter of fact, if I may, I'd like to invite anyone to write to me
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:25.860]  if they've had an adverse reaction.
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:27.860]  I'd like to help the government because they don't want to know,
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.860]  but I would like to know.
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:30.860]  All right, stop it right there.
[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:32.860]  We don't have time to get to it all,
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:34.860]  but we're going to post today when it goes to Band.
[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:36.860]  I'll be able to post the rest of the clip.
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:38.860]  But the next year, they passed a law giving liability protection
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:40.860]  to the vaccine makers.
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:42.860]  One of the bad things Ronald Reagan did,
[02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:44.860]  but there it is, folks.
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:45.860]  They've known all along.
[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:49.860]  That was Phil Donahue, right before he was controlled.

[02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:34.860]  Who died and made the globalist Bill Gates'

[02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:39.860]  While they fly around in their private jets
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:41.860]  and live on giant palatial estates,
[02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:44.860]  they tell you you gotta live in a 45-square-foot
[02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:45.860]  coffin apartment.
[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:47.860]  They announced last week,
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:49.860]  the new ones are 45 square feet.
[02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:50.860]  You don't get 250.
[02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:53.860]  That's the fancy penthouse.

[02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:00.860]  being fried.
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:02.860]  But don't worry, they'll give you lots of synthetic government drugs
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:04.860]  to fry your brain while you're dying.
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:06.860]  And then you can go to the suicide pod
[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:10.860]  and kill yourself whenever you want and get extra credit
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:12.860]  for doing it.
[02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:14.860]  Have a little party for a few weeks,
[02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:17.860]  maybe get out of the lockdown with the credits,
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:21.860]  and then agree to be euthanized.
[02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:23.860]  Isn't that trendy?
[02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:27.860]  Here's Klaus Schwab saying Los Angeles will be
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:31.860]  private car-free within seven years.
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:32.860]  You go, well, they'll never do that.
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:34.860]  Oh, they'll cut your power off.
[02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:36.860]  They'll cut your oil off.
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:38.860]  And, of course, they admit there's not enough power generation centers
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:41.860]  for even the cars they have that are electric.
[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:43.860]  But that's okay.
[02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:46.860]  You need to think it's being replaced with something.
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:47.860]  That's how you sucker the public.
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:50.860]  Here he is.
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:53.860]  I would like to make some betting with you.
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:55.860]  When we meet for the 20th,
[02:07:55.860 --> 02:08:00.860]  I hope I will have the pleasure still to be invited for the meeting.
[02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:05.860]  When we meet for the 20th Governance Summit,
[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:10.860]  you will use an app like Uber,
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:14.860]  but not anymore, to call some driver,
[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:19.860]  but an automatically guided car,
[02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:21.860]  a self-driven car,
[02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:24.860]  will come to your hotel or wherever you are
[02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:26.860]  and will bring you to the airport.
[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:28.860]  Actually, I had a discussion some months ago.
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:29.860]  Hey, boss.
[02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:31.860]  Back it up. Five seconds.
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:34.860]  If we want to, we will send you to a death camp.
[02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:36.860]  And if you complain about the shots,
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:39.860]  we will turn your chip off.
[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:41.860]  And if you don't eat the bugs,
[02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:44.860]  well, you know what will happen as well.
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:46.860]  Please continue.
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:51.860]  I had a discussion some months ago with the mayor of Los Angeles.
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:57.860]  And you know Los Angeles is one of the cities with the heaviest traffic.
[02:08:57.860 --> 02:08:59.860]  Who told me in 2030,
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:04.860]  Los Angeles will be private car driven free.
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:09.860]  And this will allow to transform highways
[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:14.860]  into parks and other public spheres.
[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:21.860]  Now, let's go ahead and go to Alan Greenspan.
[02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:24.860]  He was outgoing head of the Federal Reserve over a decade ago.
[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:28.860]  And he was asked on McNeillier News Hour on PBS,
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:32.860]  what is the role of a president and the government,
[02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:34.860]  Congress, all of it, and the Federal Reserve?
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:36.860]  He said there is no role.
[02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:38.860]  Congress is not to have any contact with it.
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:40.860]  It's totally independent.
[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:42.860]  It's called federal, but it's not federal.
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:44.860]  Federal was chartered in 1913,
[02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:47.860]  80 plus percent owned by foreign banks,
[02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:50.860]  the Rothschilds, the British Royalty, you name it.
[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:53.860]  That was admitted at the time.
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:58.860]  And then it decides who to give all the trillions to themselves,
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:00.860]  and they just pass us the inflation.
[02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:06.860]  So here we are 110 years after the establishment of that bank.
[02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:12.990]  And just like Klaus Schwab who died and made him God, who said we're gonna get
[02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:15.510]  rid of your cars, who said you're gonna eat the bugs, who said we're gonna have
[02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:19.670]  drag queen pedophile time, all funded by Disney and Nike and the big
[02:10:19.670 --> 02:10:27.270]  corporations. Disney. They did. What does Larry Fink, the head of Blackrock, they
[02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:31.910]  got 80 plus percent control of the world's wealth, investments. It's all owned by the
[02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:36.070]  same people, State Street, Blackrock, Vanguard, same group. It's like in the UK
[02:10:36.070 --> 02:10:40.870]  of like two grocery store chains owned by the same people. You think you have choice?
[02:10:40.530 --> 02:10:45.530]  Well, it all starts with the private central banks, because they control the currency.
[02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:52.530]  Lord Rothschild had above their business. I care not who runs the government,
[02:10:52.530 --> 02:10:55.530]  I care who controls the money, because I will control them.
[02:10:55.530 --> 02:11:01.530]  He who has the gold makes the rule, and these people don't want us around.
[02:11:01.530 --> 02:11:05.530]  They've decided to get rid of us, to call our numbers.
[02:11:05.530 --> 02:11:11.530]  It's a fact. It's a reality. It's where we are.
[02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:19.320]  You know, I haven't really done this. The internet has done it, and they've done an
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:26.620]  okay job, but it really hit me about ten minutes ago during a break when a very famous
[02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:33.940]  podcaster and talk show host texted me, and another very famous talk show individual last
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:40.660]  week said the same thing to me. And they're right. And one of them said this a lot to
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:49.299]  me, Joe Rogan, said, you got to write a book with all your predictions, because that blows
[02:11:49.299 --> 02:11:55.620]  people away, and how they came true, or you got to make a film. And I realized just sitting
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:59.380]  here in the last ten minutes thinking, while I was talking about other subjects, I can
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:10.780]  do that, that I can think of dozens of things right now we've specifically predicted, and
[02:12:10.780 --> 02:12:17.860]  I generally remember when I said it and when I did it, that came exactly true. And there's
[02:12:17.860 --> 02:12:22.460]  so many of these, and instead of having me just predict it, and then everybody sees it
[02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:28.019]  20 years ago, 10 years ago, 25 years ago, a year ago, we'll have me predict it and then
[02:12:28.019 --> 02:12:32.780]  show them say it right after. That's even more powerful. And I'm not going to wait to
[02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:38.900]  make some film or something. We'll just start once a month or so releasing a whole bunch
[02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:45.340]  of these, because that's valuable. Not intuiting my horn, that's what the globalists hate me,
[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:50.219]  they know I've got their number, they already know. But the public really listens, not when
[02:12:50.219 --> 02:12:52.059]  I'm telling you what's coming next.
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:57.100]  But when I show you that I told you what was coming next in the past,
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:13:01.100]  all the mainstream media, corporate media lies to you about what's happening today,
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:04.100]  I do my damnedest to tell you about what's happening next.
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:07.100]  And if I've got...
[02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:13.590]  Chuck Carlson, Joe Rogan, everybody else telling me, you've got to do this.
[02:13:13.590 --> 02:13:16.470]  I think I got to do it.
[02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:22.430]  So I was going to run back and tell Dew and McBreen, everybody, drop what you're doing
[02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:24.710]  and let's get all the big famous well-known predictions.
[02:13:24.710 --> 02:13:29.150]  Let's try to find the raw ones too, because you guys put new versions together where it's
[02:13:29.150 --> 02:13:31.590]  me talking, but then you can't go to the ballgame.
[02:13:31.590 --> 02:13:35.630]  You got to wear a mask, forced injections, robot drones control you, and we can cut to
[02:13:35.630 --> 02:13:36.630]  it actually happening.
[02:13:37.150 --> 02:13:41.510]  We need to find the raw footage, and then have me say it and the date, and then cut
[02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:45.190]  to them saying word for word the exact same thing 10 years later.
[02:13:45.190 --> 02:13:47.070]  Now people say, how the hell do you do that?
[02:13:47.070 --> 02:13:48.710]  It's in the white papers.
[02:13:48.710 --> 02:13:49.710]  It's in the documents.
[02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:54.190]  20 years ago, they weren't saying this stuff on the dais at the World Government Forum.
[02:13:54.190 --> 02:13:57.350]  They just had a few months ago in the Middle East.
[02:13:58.650 --> 02:14:03.049]  But now they are.
[02:14:03.049 --> 02:14:04.049]  Before they weren't.
[02:14:04.049 --> 02:14:07.530]  So now is really the time to nail them with this.
[02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:10.610]  And it really is the most important thing we do.
[02:14:10.610 --> 02:14:12.610]  And so I want all hands decked.
[02:14:12.610 --> 02:14:16.530]  First, we've got to remember all the things I've broken down and told you it was coming.
[02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:19.790]  Then we've got to find the clip of me saying it, and then find the clip of them saying
[02:14:19.790 --> 02:14:20.790]  it currently.
[02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:24.410]  But basically, you can search anything they're saying currently, put my name on it and find
[02:14:24.410 --> 02:14:25.410]  the past.
[02:14:25.410 --> 02:14:26.410]  That's probably the best way to do it.
[02:14:26.410 --> 02:14:30.530]  And of course, it's word for word, because I wasn't gazing into a crystal ball.
[02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:32.330]  I wasn't looking into a pool of water.
[02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:33.730]  I wasn't staring at the stars.
[02:14:33.730 --> 02:14:39.330]  I wasn't, you know, cutting a chicken's guts out and reading the entrails like angels would
[02:14:39.330 --> 02:14:40.330]  do.
[02:14:40.330 --> 02:14:44.210]  I'm telling you what their plan is and what they say they're going to do.
[02:14:44.210 --> 02:14:50.610]  And then it comes home to Ruth, hey, I just learned these people were in charge.
[02:14:50.610 --> 02:14:53.530]  Decades and decades and decades ago, and we're really taking control of the world and are
[02:14:53.530 --> 02:14:54.809]  bad people.
[02:14:54.809 --> 02:15:00.250]  And so I knew that if I warned you about it, you'd attack me then because it sounded crazy.
[02:15:00.250 --> 02:15:05.009]  But then when the next phases came true, right before the final accelerated extermination
[02:15:05.009 --> 02:15:10.410]  phase came, which we're entering, you'd have a good chance of beating them.
[02:15:10.410 --> 02:15:15.530]  I don't want to say my work is almost completed, but a lot of people now understand what's
[02:15:15.530 --> 02:15:16.530]  coming next.
[02:15:16.530 --> 02:15:17.530]  They can track the enemy.
[02:15:17.530 --> 02:15:19.809]  They know to watch the enemy now.
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:26.400]  And I still have a lot of things to talk about coming in the future, but
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:30.400]  the most powerful thing we can do
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:34.400]  is break down what happened in the past
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:36.400]  so people know the future.
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:38.400]  Alright, I'm going to stop there.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:41.400]  It wasn't name dropping, it just shows where all this is going.
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:43.400]  It's thermal nuclear against the enemy.
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:46.400]  And we got a real shot at beating them.
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:48.400]  And
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:50.400]  it's just an amazing time to be alive.
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:52.400]  I want to thank the viewers and listeners for boosting this show.
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:53.400]  You really get the credit.

[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:35.400]  relieve pain, and decrease inflammation.
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:39.400]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia,

[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:47.400]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol,
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:51.400]  increase serotonin, and boost vitality.

[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:28.400]  such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.

[02:18:55.400 --> 02:19:00.400]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength,
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:03.400]  and they can only be obtained through diet.
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:08.400]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:14.400]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:19.400]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:25.400]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com.

[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:03.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:05.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:33.840]  I've tried living at risky, relied on women and whiskey to chase my blues to turn my nights to days.
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:46.840]  First rage, only a pastime. With age, more than a lifetime. Day in, day out, the world just turns away.
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:21:14.840]  But everybody knows you live and you learn. But the lessons just go on and on. I guess we're gonna have to wait for all the pages to turn to find out if it's right or if it's wrong.
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:15.840]  You live, you learn.
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.840]  You live, you learn.
[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:21.840]  All right, let's get back to the Greenspan clip that I talked about that I didn't get to.
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:25.840]  Here he is saying, what is the role of the government in oversight? Nothing.
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:27.840]  What's the role of oversight with big tech? Nothing.
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:30.840]  What's the role of oversight with BlackRock? Nothing.
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:32.840]  What's the oversight with the UN? Nothing.
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:37.840]  The UN is having us sign treaties to take full control of our medical care and our bodies.
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:40.840]  It's a total world government takeover.
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:43.840]  What is the ideology of the people that want to run our lives?
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:48.840]  World freak, death cult, transhumanist, eugenicist.
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:50.840]  And that's where we are.
[02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:58.340]  So, here's Greenspan.
[02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:08.340]  I apply it. I have the ideology because I believe that it is the best way of coming at the world and what type of policy.
[02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:17.340]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:22.340]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:33.340]  And that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:43.340]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:47.340]  is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing,
[02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:52.340]  then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[02:22:52.340 --> 02:22:55.340]  So there you go.
[02:22:55.340 --> 02:22:57.340]  Total arrogance.
[02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:01.340]  Absolute control freaks.
[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:13.340]  And then we've got Mr. T and tied in Travis Kellis as Pfizer spokespersons being paid to come out and say,
[02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:17.340]  I got my shot, thank God, I'm protected now.
[02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:24.340]  Yeah, where's the investigation of Pfizer and Moderna running ads on Sesame Street before it was even approved for children?
[02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:26.340]  That's a felony.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:29.340]  But it's a felony to do no public human studies.
[02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:31.340]  They really did them.
[02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:36.340]  And then tell you that it's a tested, safe shot.
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:39.340]  They're lying to everyone.
[02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:42.340]  They're lying to you.
[02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:48.340]  And that's why they've got to, quote, censor disinformation, translate disinformation equals truth,
[02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:52.340]  because they'll never get away with what they're doing if the truth's out there.
[02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:58.340]  They'll get the LeBron Jameses and the Mr. T's and the Travis Kellis.
[02:23:59.910 --> 02:24:05.910]  Come out and tell you how great everything is and you'll be protected.
[02:24:05.910 --> 02:24:09.910]  You won't transmit it and you won't get sick.
[02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:12.910]  And now they go, oh, actually, if you had the previous Moderna shot or Pfizer shot,
[02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:16.910]  you got to get the new booster because you're more likely to get sick.
[02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:18.910]  They said that two weeks ago, which is true.
[02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:20.910]  But this new shot is not going to protect you.
[02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:23.910]  But they're roping people in.
[02:24:24.910 --> 02:24:27.910]  Hey, Mr. T, how much money you get to do that?
[02:24:28.290 --> 02:24:36.530]  Hey, Travis, tell us, the 20, 30 million a year you're paid's not enough, huh?
[02:24:36.530 --> 02:24:41.970]  How do you say it, Travis Kelsey, I can't, I don't follow the NFL, I don't, that's not
[02:24:41.970 --> 02:24:45.170]  very manly to not follow, yeah, you know, I'm actually fighting people trying to kill
[02:24:45.170 --> 02:24:47.690]  us, so I don't know all these people's names.
[02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:50.290]  Let's play Mr. T and then this other guy.
[02:24:50.290 --> 02:24:57.770]  Hey, everybody, this is Mr. T. I'm about to get my COVID vaccine booster shot.
[02:24:57.770 --> 02:25:03.610]  I'm in my sketches, yes, I do everything in sketches, yes, I get healthy in sketches,
[02:25:03.610 --> 02:25:24.250]  yeah, you heard me, get your vaccination booster, yeah, yeah, 1-5-6, I think it's 3-1-0,
[02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:30.450]  yeah, no, 3-8-7-6, all right, Travis, did you know you can get this season's COVID-19
[02:25:30.450 --> 02:25:32.010]  shot when you get your flu shot?
[02:25:32.010 --> 02:25:42.610]  Oh, two things at once, two things at once, two things at once, I'll have the two things
[02:25:42.610 --> 02:25:49.850]  at once, please, now back to two things at once, two things at once, that's not two things
[02:25:49.850 --> 02:25:56.850]  at once, mom, Travis, ask about getting this season's COVID-19 shot when getting your flu
[02:25:56.850 --> 02:26:00.210]  shot.
[02:26:00.210 --> 02:26:05.210]  Absolute moron idiots, of course, you know, a lot of the spokespersons have not taken
[02:26:05.210 --> 02:26:11.650]  the shots and just say they do, but a lot have and they end up dead, so I mentioned
[02:26:11.650 --> 02:26:17.570]  this earlier, but look, bombshell report, COVID vaccines cause allergy linked to increased
[02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:22.670]  mortality resulting in 17 million deaths, a bombshell scientific report, but a whole
[02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:27.190]  bunch of others say the same thing, claim that instead of saving lives, experimental
[02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:33.390]  COVID vaccines were casually or causally linked to drastic increases in all-cause mortality
[02:26:33.390 --> 02:26:38.550]  in 17 countries, ultimately resulting in 17 million deaths, and they find that the countries
[02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:45.390]  that didn't take the shots don't have those numbers, remember, Africa had the lowest infection
[02:26:45.390 --> 02:26:49.910]  rate of like 3% for COVID because they're not dumb, they've been shot up a bunch by
[02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:55.590]  the UN, they had almost no one take it, the report published by the Correlation Research
[02:26:55.590 --> 02:27:00.430]  in the Public Interest on September 17th, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, but
[02:27:00.430 --> 02:27:05.990]  a whole bunch of others have, qualified the vaccine dose fatality rate BDFR across all
[02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:12.030]  ages with measurements of the ratio of vaccine-induced deaths to the total number of vaccines administered
[02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:16.430]  to the population, one of all the other studies we covered said 15 to 20 million dead, what's
[02:27:16.430 --> 02:27:23.670]  Edward Dowd said? The researchers, who are prestigious, found that the mean of all ages,
[02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:30.990]  fatal toxology by injection of the VDFR, one death per 800 injections across all ages and
[02:27:30.990 --> 02:27:37.230]  countries, in other words, of 13.25 billion injections delivered as of September 2nd,
[02:27:37.230 --> 02:27:42.510]  2023, 17 million died from vaccine-related deaths, and it goes on, if you want to see
[02:27:42.510 --> 02:27:47.430]  the whole study, here it is, and it mirrors all the other big studies, that's why we keep
[02:27:47.430 --> 02:27:51.870]  putting out the same similar number, the COVID-19 Vaccine Association Mortality in the Southern
[02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:59.310]  Hemisphere, who said mandates weren't coming back, mandates alive and well, Texas College
[02:27:59.310 --> 02:28:06.150]  imposes COVID vaccine mandates for students and faculty, Baylor, now let's go to break
[02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:10.830]  and come back with this clip, British Columbia to reinstate mass mandate in all healthcare
[02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:17.190]  settings as rising COVID-19 and flu cases, and it ties in with a lot more, then I'm going
[02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:23.350]  to shift gears into political news, economic news, military news, Trump news, the Democrat
[02:28:23.350 --> 02:28:27.630]  congressman caught pulling the fire alarm on video, he says he thought it was the door
[02:28:27.630 --> 02:28:31.150]  handle on the side of the wall, oh, let me just open the door here, that's where I work
[02:28:31.150 --> 02:28:36.350]  every day, right when the Democrats are trying to stop the vote, he goes and pulls a fire
[02:28:36.350 --> 02:28:46.670]  alarm, oh, I just pulled a fire alarm over here, that's how you open doors, by the way,
[02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:50.630]  Republicans are just, Trump supporters just walked to the Capitol and got five, six years
[02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:54.710]  in prison, imagine if you pulled a fire alarm, they'd give you the death penalty, but not

[02:29:57.870 --> 02:30:01.990]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high quality
[02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:06.110]  coffee has not been available, and that's because the prices went up too high for the
[02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:10.350]  raw beans and the quality had gone down some, I turned down so many companies that wanted
[02:30:10.350 --> 02:30:16.830]  to work with us, but now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from
[02:30:16.830 --> 02:30:22.670]  a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated, it's powered by the company
[02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:29.910]  Minute Man Coffee, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest
[02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:35.910]  coffee that I have ever drank, it is game changing, all you gotta do is buy a bag of
[02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:42.030]  it and try it, I know you're gonna be hooked, which will then fund your operation.
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:31:06.760]  I didn't realize this was back this week, I thought it was next week, I come in this
[02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:11.039]  morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[02:31:11.039 --> 02:31:16.840]  These Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:18.880]  Overhead shot please.
[02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:23.119]  Look how full this bottle is.
[02:31:23.119 --> 02:31:26.160]  Right to the top, folks.
[02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:30.960]  Right to the top with these 95% Cucuminoid.
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:36.000]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.740]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:46.180]  This is 95%, super concentrated, so like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average
[02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:47.180]  pill.
[02:31:47.180 --> 02:31:50.100]  It's that powerful, or more.
[02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:56.380]  So they're available at InfoWarsStore.com, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out
[02:31:56.380 --> 02:32:03.900]  for almost eight months, back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:09.300]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfoWarsStore and InfoWarsLife not at a probiotic for more
[02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:10.300]  than three years?
[02:32:10.300 --> 02:32:11.539]  The answer is simple.
[02:32:11.539 --> 02:32:14.460]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:18.660]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:23.300]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones
[02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:24.300]  anymore.
[02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:30.300]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:05.900]  Defeating a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.370 --> 02:33:18.370]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.370 --> 02:33:27.370]  Don't tread on me. Well, Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and BlackRock say they're going to tread on you. Larry Fink's treading on you big time.
[02:33:27.370 --> 02:33:36.370]  These are big enemies, but together we can get them off our backs by identifying them, by not accepting their global government cashless society.
[02:33:36.370 --> 02:33:42.370]  By not letting them brainwash our children. By suing them when they put in 5G.
[02:33:42.370 --> 02:33:51.370]  By going to city council and saying you're not brainwashing white kids that they're all racist and evil, or having them covort with pedophiles.
[02:33:51.370 --> 02:33:58.370]  We didn't start this fight. And once provoked, we're never backing down.
[02:33:58.370 --> 02:34:02.370]  Play a little bit of the song. Put something else on screen, shout out to me.
[02:34:02.370 --> 02:34:18.370]  Never begins this. Never wants to engage. Never surrenders. Showing the fangs of rage.
[02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:26.370]  Stand up for me. So be it. So be it.
[02:34:26.370 --> 02:34:33.370]  Tread no more. To secure the pieces. To prepare for war.
[02:34:33.370 --> 02:34:42.370]  So be it. Settle the score. Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore.
[02:34:42.370 --> 02:35:01.370]  Love it or leave it. She was a deadly bite. Quick as the blue tongue. Forced in a lightning strike.
[02:35:01.370 --> 02:35:08.370]  Shining with brightness. Always in surveillance. We all will never know.
[02:35:09.370 --> 02:35:15.370]  No be it. We are back live.
[02:35:15.370 --> 02:35:23.370]  So all over the western world where the globos are controlled, they are rolling out the masks, the vaccine mandates, the testing.
[02:35:23.370 --> 02:35:32.370]  It's all happening. But because we got ahead of it, they're rolling it out a little bit slower because they're getting major resistance.
[02:35:32.370 --> 02:35:40.370]  They're trying it by stealth. But here's British Columbia to reinstate mask mandates in all health care settings amid rising COVID-19 flu cases.
[02:35:40.370 --> 02:35:46.370]  And from Texas to New York to California to Illinois, it's happening here as well.
[02:35:46.370 --> 02:35:51.370]  Back to wearing masks full time at all health care settings.
[02:35:51.370 --> 02:35:57.370]  With back to school that started three weeks ago, I think inevitably there's exchange of viruses and that includes COVID.
[02:35:57.370 --> 02:36:08.370]  Global News has obtained a memo from the Ministry of Health to health care providers in preparation for the viral respiratory illness this fall and winter.
[02:36:08.370 --> 02:36:22.370]  B.C. will be reinstating enhanced infection prevention and control measures in health care settings, services and programs, including community physician offices and outpatient clinics.
[02:36:22.370 --> 02:36:25.370]  The province set to make the announcement Thursday.
[02:36:25.370 --> 02:36:35.370]  It's not a secret we've been talking about this for about a month that for the respiratory illness season in the fall, we would expect in health care settings enhanced masking.
[02:36:35.370 --> 02:36:40.370]  The measures set to go into effect next Tuesday will include.
[02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:46.370]  Please back it up 15 seconds. It's no secret we've been talking about this for a month.
[02:36:46.370 --> 02:36:49.370]  So six weeks ago.
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:59.040]  I said within three weeks all over the Western world, they will start trying to roll out all the COVID protocols again.
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:06.040]  And you just heard their spokesman, it's no secret, we've been saying this for a month.
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:11.040]  See, got a memo from the Ministry of Health.
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:18.040]  TSA got a memo too saying get ready on or around the 15th for mask mandates for TSA workers.
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:22.040]  Then by the middle of October, more of it rolling out.
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:26.040]  So 90% of what we said was going to happen to happen.
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:28.040]  I said, let's get ahead of it and stop it.
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:34.040]  And I'll be glad to see the left and the eugenicists and the death cult do a victory lap and say, oh, look, it didn't happen.
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:36.040]  Because I said, we'll stop it.
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:38.040]  There's a chance we can stop it.
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:44.040]  Go to city council, go to the legislatures, file lawsuits, call C-SPAN, call Congress.
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:45.040]  If you're in Canada, say no.
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:47.040]  Have a new trucker protest.
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.040]  Don't go along with it is the point.
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:52.040]  I said, they're going to try to roll it out.
[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:53.040]  We can stop them.
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:55.040]  If we stop them, they'll say we made it up.
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:56.040]  Who cares?
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:57.040]  We know they're doing it.
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:58.040]  Now they've done it.
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:05.040]  The people should be 10 times more aggressive now in saying no to this.
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:07.040]  Finish the clip.
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:09.040]  It's not a secret.
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:14.040]  We've been talking about this for about a month, that for the respiratory illness season in the fall,
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:17.040]  we would expect in health care settings enhanced maskings.
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:25.040]  The measures set to go into effect next Tuesday will include continuous masking by all health care workers,
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:27.040]  patients and visitors.
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:32.040]  Long term care settings, though, are not included in the renewed directive.
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:36.040]  There is concern of pushback, the move contentious for some.
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:41.040]  I want to believe people recognize that the patients who are in those facilities are vulnerable,
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:47.040]  and although we'll understand why they have to do it, we'll still do it and not cause too much pain.
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:48.040]  Pause again.
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:52.040]  These are the people all over the world, whether it was Australia, Canada, the U.S., all run by the U.N.,
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:57.040]  all run by the WF, all run by the CIA protocols that Fauci and them cooked up.
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:00.040]  It's all come out now, like I told you three and a half years ago who ran it.
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:05.040]  Department of Defense, all of it, all the ganging up and brainwashing and creating fear and,
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:07.040]  quote, terrorizing the public.
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:08.040]  That's the London Telegraph headline.
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:12.040]  British Ministry of Defense terrorized the public to stay locked up and wear a mask.
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:14.040]  They locked up the old people.
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:16.040]  They wouldn't let you visit them for years.
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:17.040]  Massive death.
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:22.040]  They put COVID patients in with them to get them sick and kill them and then milk them for $53,000,
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:26.040]  same number all over the world, to kill them, to put them on a ventilator.
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:28.040]  And now they put this guy up.
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:29.040]  They're invulnerable.
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:30.040]  Be nice.
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:31.040]  You wear a mask.
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:32.040]  Don't go see them.
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:37.040]  And by next year, you watch, by January, they'll say you can't see your parents again.
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:39.040]  You can't see your father or mother again.
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:41.040]  You can't see your grandparents again.
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:43.040]  You can't see your son that's in a car wreck again.
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.040]  They're doing it again!
[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:56.260]  I told you on my children that I was contacted by someone I know and trust that I made more
[02:39:56.260 --> 02:39:58.640]  calls.
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.180]  I don't make stuff up, ever!
[02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:06.500]  I get things wrong 5% of the time, maybe.
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:09.620]  I don't know if Alex is right, I don't think they'd try that.
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:10.620]  Why?
[02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:12.940]  That's really dumb, nobody's buying it.
[02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:19.020]  Universities, medical facilities, government installations, that's where they start!
[02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:20.140]  In the corporations!
[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:27.640]  I don't eat a lot of fast food, but I was up at 5, I left the house at 6, had things
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:28.640]  to do.
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:30.080]  Went to have a meeting with a friend.
[02:40:32.190 --> 02:40:40.430]  And I got some Chick-fil-A and every damn employee when I went to the drive-thru window
[02:40:40.430 --> 02:40:50.670]  I looked in was wearing the stinking mask again.
[02:40:50.670 --> 02:40:54.470]  So yeah, they're doing it in front of you.
[02:40:54.470 --> 02:40:56.350]  It isn't about tooting my horn.
[02:40:56.350 --> 02:41:00.350]  That's one of the other things to put in the Alex Jones prediction thing though guys.
[02:41:00.350 --> 02:41:05.390]  I predicted, because we're putting this together right now, so I'm so limited on time I just direct on air.
[02:41:05.390 --> 02:41:15.310]  I predicted Russia would invade in February, in October, before that, five months before.
[02:41:15.310 --> 02:41:18.590]  And they'll call it a prediction, it wasn't, it was real sources.
[02:41:18.590 --> 02:41:23.070]  Alex Jones predicted they'd try to roll out COVID protocols again and they're trying.
[02:41:23.070 --> 02:41:23.870]  It goes on and on.
[02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:27.030]  But I just need to think of a whole bunch of these because these get people's attention.
[02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:29.910]  Those clips get millions of views.
[02:41:29.910 --> 02:41:36.470]  I'd love to get millions of views for the new stuff I'm warning you about that's dead on, but that doesn't seem to happen.
[02:41:36.470 --> 02:41:39.310]  So if I get somebody to watch an old clip to watch a new clip, I'll do it.
[02:41:39.310 --> 02:41:46.550]  Whatever is effective, using the truth, I do it.
[02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:47.910]  All right, skip this break.
[02:41:47.910 --> 02:41:50.950]  I need more time to finish up this hour with all this news.
[02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:56.310]  I need to take a break though and let's have some fun here for a minute.
[02:41:56.310 --> 02:41:59.990]  This video is accurate, but they do it in a funny way.
[02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:04.790]  Play the Klaus Schwab greatest hits video.
[02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:12.150]  And then play that clip I wanted from a few years ago with the Fauci shot cartoon.
[02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:17.310]  And then I'm going to come back and just accelerate through all this other news.
[02:42:17.310 --> 02:42:19.910]  Here it is.
[02:42:19.910 --> 02:42:31.590]  The people who brought you, you know, nothing and be happy comes a brand new collection of hit songs from our beloved supreme leader.
[02:42:31.590 --> 02:42:35.390]  Time Lies presents The Great Here Set, Volume 14.
[02:42:35.390 --> 02:42:42.630]  Everybody, jab your body right.
[02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:47.590]  Vaccines back, all right.
[02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:50.150]  One, two, three and to the four.
[02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:57.390]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates is at the door, ready to put a patent on air and glass because we are about to greatly set your ass.
[02:42:57.390 --> 02:42:59.950]  It's like this and like that and like this and that.
[02:42:59.950 --> 02:43:06.270]  So just chill till the next pandemic.
[02:43:06.270 --> 02:43:16.590]  Digital identity, you shall have until 2030.
[02:43:16.590 --> 02:43:22.990]  No discussion for it is mandatory.
[02:43:22.990 --> 02:43:31.470]  You will see 50 minutes, 50, 50 minutes, 50.
[02:43:31.470 --> 02:43:38.270]  Stay close to 50 minutes, 50, 50 minutes, 50.
[02:43:38.270 --> 02:43:43.790]  Oh, we'll send. You better comply.
[02:43:43.790 --> 02:43:45.510]  You better watch out.
[02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:48.150]  You better implant that microchip.
[02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:54.550]  Now Santa Claus is running the town.
[02:43:54.550 --> 02:44:06.630]  Every meal you make, every bite you take, every single lunch with a crispy crunch.
[02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:09.750]  You will eat that box.
[02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:12.430]  The Great Here Set, Volume 14.
[02:44:12.430 --> 02:44:17.070]  Get yours now. Available on Shodify and Pfizer Music.
[02:44:17.070 --> 02:44:21.070]  So Willie has what I need.
[02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:24.910]  I ordered Willie magazine.
[02:44:24.910 --> 02:44:48.190]  The new Willie means fun and trouble.
[02:44:48.190 --> 02:44:49.630]  Hello. Hello.
[02:44:49.630 --> 02:44:51.790]  Have you been vaccinated yet?
[02:44:51.790 --> 02:44:53.870]  I think I'm going to wait a bit longer.
[02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:55.550]  Why do you need to wait?
[02:44:55.550 --> 02:44:57.150]  I'm just not in a rush.
[02:44:57.150 --> 02:44:59.470]  Well, everybody's getting vaccinated.
[02:44:59.470 --> 02:45:01.310]  I've been vaccinated.
[02:45:01.310 --> 02:45:03.710]  Why are you being so selfish?
[02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:05.150]  How am I being selfish?
[02:45:05.150 --> 02:45:09.390]  Because if you get COVID, you could pass it on to me.
[02:45:09.390 --> 02:45:10.910]  But you've been vaccinated.
[02:45:10.910 --> 02:45:13.710]  Yes, yes, but I could still get it.
[02:45:13.710 --> 02:45:16.190]  So if I get vaccinated, I can still get it.
[02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:19.870]  Yeah, but you should still get the vaccine.
[02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:22.990]  You can catch it off me whether I've been vaccinated or not.
[02:45:22.990 --> 02:45:25.950]  Yes, but you should still get vaccinated.
[02:45:25.950 --> 02:45:26.510]  Why?
[02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:28.830]  Because it's the right thing to do.
[02:45:28.830 --> 02:45:29.790]  Says who?
[02:45:29.790 --> 02:45:31.150]  Says me.
[02:45:31.150 --> 02:45:32.830]  Dr. Fauci.
[02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:35.470]  The guy who created the virus.
[02:45:37.310 --> 02:45:39.470]  Roll up that sleeve.
[02:45:52.990 --> 02:46:04.270]  Guys, I forgot to ask you.
[02:46:04.270 --> 02:46:05.070]  Is it on the list?
[02:46:05.710 --> 02:46:08.430]  Trump calls for Democrat who pulled fire alarm to be prosecuted.
[02:46:09.310 --> 02:46:09.870]  We have that.
[02:46:12.430 --> 02:46:13.310]  If you don't have that, get that.
[02:46:13.310 --> 02:46:14.270]  I'm going to get that in a few minutes.
[02:46:15.310 --> 02:46:18.270]  I want to talk about Trump getting persecuted before I get into World War III next year.
[02:46:18.670 --> 02:46:23.550]  Jack Smith demands gag order for Trump proclaiming General Milley should be executed for treason.
[02:46:25.310 --> 02:46:30.990]  It's his right to say he believes he committed treason by telling the Communist Chinese,
[02:46:30.990 --> 02:46:33.950]  if we're going to launch an attack on you or respond, I'll tell you first.
[02:46:34.750 --> 02:46:35.870]  Let me say that slowly.
[02:46:37.230 --> 02:46:38.270]  I've got the new codes.
[02:46:38.270 --> 02:46:39.550]  Trump isn't in control.
[02:46:40.110 --> 02:46:41.470]  We're not going to attack you.
[02:46:41.470 --> 02:46:44.190]  And if I get an order to attack you, I'll let you know first.
[02:46:45.070 --> 02:46:46.590]  Oh, hi, we're about to attack you.
[02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:48.350]  Oh, hi, we're about to attack you.
[02:46:48.350 --> 02:46:50.750]  That is as treasonous as it gets.
[02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:55.790]  And it takes any mutually assured destruction deterrent away.
[02:46:57.470 --> 02:47:00.750]  That's what Benedict Arnold did in the Revolutionary War.
[02:47:00.750 --> 02:47:02.830]  Hey, George Washington's coming to attack you in two days.
[02:47:06.590 --> 02:47:11.070]  But how is it that they can leak all this stuff and attack Trump all over the news,
[02:47:11.070 --> 02:47:16.430]  lying about Trump and all this persecution, trying to get him off the ballot for saying
[02:47:16.430 --> 02:47:19.550]  there's election fraud when they're involved in election fraud right now?
[02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:27.070]  And then turn around and say, gag the president.
[02:47:27.070 --> 02:47:29.310]  Their last attempt failed because it's so outrageous.
[02:47:29.310 --> 02:47:31.310]  It's beyond election meddling.
[02:47:32.190 --> 02:47:33.390]  This is election meddling, too.
[02:47:33.390 --> 02:47:34.670]  Let me know when you have the Trump clip, guys.
[02:47:35.630 --> 02:47:38.270]  Search engine optimization or political bias.
[02:47:38.270 --> 02:47:42.430]  Biden challengers nearly non-existent in Google results.
[02:47:42.430 --> 02:47:43.150]  I've noticed that.
[02:47:43.710 --> 02:47:45.390]  You can't find RFK Jr. on Google.
[02:47:45.550 --> 02:47:46.350]  We'll go somewhere else.
[02:47:46.350 --> 02:47:50.270]  90 plus percent, like 93 percent of searches are Googled.
[02:47:50.270 --> 02:47:51.950]  That's what Professor Epstein has exposed.
[02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:52.910]  He's on the show soon.
[02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:58.110]  Not Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:47:58.110 --> 02:48:01.310]  I want to go to a Steve Bannon clip, then we'll go to Trump and the Democrat pulling
[02:48:01.310 --> 02:48:02.030]  the fire alarm.
[02:48:03.630 --> 02:48:06.990]  Here's Steve Bannon really succinctly breaking down what they've announced.
[02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:13.150]  The judge found Trump guilty last week because he said Mar-a-Lago is only worth 18 million.
[02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:15.550]  It's on the tax rolls over 200 million.
[02:48:15.550 --> 02:48:16.910]  That's what Trump says it's worth.
[02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:18.510]  This is beyond insane.
[02:48:19.230 --> 02:48:23.070]  It's like when the judge put on a financial expert that never saw our files and said,
[02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:24.430]  Jones is worth $400 million.
[02:48:26.190 --> 02:48:30.350]  So the jury said, well, we're going to give the families 10 percent since he's guilty.
[02:48:30.350 --> 02:48:31.470]  They were supposed to decide how much.
[02:48:32.910 --> 02:48:35.550]  Forty-something million dollars, $3 million at the time.
[02:48:35.550 --> 02:48:37.870]  Now we're going to have $500,000, $200,000.
[02:48:39.150 --> 02:48:41.070]  I got that in the bank, but I owe these legal bills.
[02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:42.270]  I'm upside down, actually.
[02:48:42.350 --> 02:48:43.150]  About $500,000.
[02:48:44.510 --> 02:48:47.790]  And then she let him get up there for a day and lie about me and told us you're not allowed
[02:48:47.790 --> 02:48:49.070]  to respond to this section.
[02:48:49.710 --> 02:48:50.510]  You're defaulted.
[02:48:51.550 --> 02:48:54.750]  It's the same thing, except it's the other way around.
[02:48:54.750 --> 02:48:57.870]  Jones is worth $400 million or I'm worth $260 million.
[02:48:57.870 --> 02:48:59.390]  Free speech is worth $140 million.
[02:48:59.390 --> 02:49:01.310]  That's $400 million.
[02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:05.870]  Free speech systems has great crew and great archives.
[02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:11.150]  But as a building and a crew, it's a liability.
[02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:12.830]  It costs tons of money to run it.
[02:49:15.070 --> 02:49:17.150]  Couldn't go out to a bank and borrow money.
[02:49:17.150 --> 02:49:18.510]  You can't even hardly get a bank.
[02:49:19.230 --> 02:49:22.750]  But this shot up burning operation that's still kicking ass.
[02:49:22.750 --> 02:49:27.950]  We're like John Paul Jones's ship on fire fighting a British ship three times the size.
[02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:29.790]  They said, would you like to surrender over their bullhorn?
[02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:32.910]  They have electric bullhorns, you know, the old fashioned kind.
[02:49:33.710 --> 02:49:35.470]  They said, surrender.
[02:49:35.470 --> 02:49:36.830]  I've only begun to fight.
[02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:39.790]  And he ended up taking the British ship and saving his.
[02:49:39.790 --> 02:49:43.950]  But I mean, we're shot to hell here and full of bullet holes.
[02:49:44.830 --> 02:49:46.350]  And it is a grand display.
[02:49:46.350 --> 02:49:47.630]  Everybody, it's like the Alamo.
[02:49:47.630 --> 02:49:49.070]  They lost, but they won.
[02:49:49.070 --> 02:49:50.030]  And that's how this is.
[02:49:50.030 --> 02:49:52.350]  I'm just going to go on to the end, make them do whatever they're going to do.
[02:49:53.230 --> 02:49:55.950]  I'm going out blazing in the info war.
[02:49:55.950 --> 02:49:58.830]  And we may make it through this, but we're not surrendering.
[02:50:00.750 --> 02:50:02.110]  We're not surrendering.
[02:50:02.110 --> 02:50:04.670]  You heard all those lies last year on bankruptcy.
[02:50:04.670 --> 02:50:06.350]  Jones has hundreds of millions hidden.
[02:50:06.350 --> 02:50:07.710]  Jones made $50 million last year.
[02:50:08.270 --> 02:50:09.310]  Now the judge knows.
[02:50:10.030 --> 02:50:13.710]  And he's not a controlled bot and paid for like the ones they had in the civil cases.
[02:50:14.590 --> 02:50:16.590]  He's known respected as fair.
[02:50:16.590 --> 02:50:17.790]  We'll see what happens.
[02:50:17.790 --> 02:50:21.950]  But he's not pleased that they go in the court and they'd say these big tall tales.
[02:50:23.550 --> 02:50:27.550]  Like saying Jones is a 300 foot blue whale.
[02:50:28.670 --> 02:50:32.110]  And then they go bring the whale in and it's a three inch long perch.
[02:50:34.030 --> 02:50:37.150]  Literally, it's equivalent of like Jones is King Kong.
[02:50:37.150 --> 02:50:38.430]  He's 400 feet tall.
[02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:39.870]  And then they open the cage.
[02:50:39.870 --> 02:50:41.310]  There's a little monkey sitting in it.
[02:50:41.310 --> 02:50:43.310]  Little rhesus monkey about eight inches long.
[02:50:43.310 --> 02:50:45.150]  They're like, that doesn't look like King Kong to me.
[02:50:45.150 --> 02:50:46.590]  Well, we told you it's King Kong.
[02:50:46.590 --> 02:50:47.150]  We told you.
[02:50:48.910 --> 02:50:50.590]  Jones is lying in federal filings.
[02:50:50.590 --> 02:50:53.710]  He'd go to prison for decades saying he doesn't have any money.
[02:50:53.710 --> 02:50:55.550]  But he's got $400 million.
[02:50:56.990 --> 02:51:00.030]  He made $55 million last year or whatever it was.
[02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:00.990]  $56 million.
[02:51:00.990 --> 02:51:02.670]  We're like, what the hell are you talking about?
[02:51:02.910 --> 02:51:06.110]  But that's just what they do because it's fun for them.
[02:51:06.110 --> 02:51:09.390]  They've got the corporate media and the CIA and the New World Order.
[02:51:09.390 --> 02:51:11.390]  And it's so much fun.
[02:51:11.390 --> 02:51:13.230]  And there's no rules for them.
[02:51:13.230 --> 02:51:16.510]  And they can, you know, the liberals can teach your six year old they're evil because they're
[02:51:16.510 --> 02:51:21.230]  white in between visiting a convicted pedophile, drag queen pedophile time.
[02:51:22.270 --> 02:51:25.550]  So here's Steve Bannon talking about it because they've announced in the news,
[02:51:25.550 --> 02:51:29.790]  the judge says, and when the jury finds him guilty, we already found him guilty.
[02:51:29.790 --> 02:51:30.190]  Guilty.
[02:51:30.190 --> 02:51:31.070]  We already found him guilty.
[02:51:31.070 --> 02:51:36.110]  But when they found out how guilty is, we're planning to take his golf courses and his
[02:51:37.870 --> 02:51:39.710]  high rises, including his home.
[02:51:40.430 --> 02:51:47.070]  We're intending to take his property because he said Mar-a-Lago was worth $200 million.
[02:51:47.070 --> 02:51:51.630]  And we say it's $18 million, even though it's worked out on the tax rolls over $200 million.
[02:51:51.630 --> 02:51:53.470]  And they can sell it for half a billion right now.
[02:51:53.470 --> 02:51:55.310]  Reality doesn't matter.
[02:51:56.500 --> 02:52:00.500]  Donald Trump is a fraud.
[02:52:00.500 --> 02:52:03.500]  The judge said, have you seen this judge?
[02:52:03.500 --> 02:52:07.500]  Have you seen this judge?
[02:52:07.500 --> 02:52:11.500]  Let's just say this, if I need a babysitter, I'm going to call him.
[02:52:11.500 --> 02:52:17.500]  He could be the vampire in Fright Night, no makeup needed.
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:22.500]  And I'm not trying to be mean about how he looks, but I mean, he looks like Biden.
[02:52:22.500 --> 02:52:26.500]  He looks like a reanimated, you know, like skeleton or something.
[02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:29.500]  It's like, where do they get these people?
[02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:31.500]  I mean, look at this guy.
[02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:33.500]  I say it's worth 18 million.
[02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:34.500]  You are guilty.
[02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:36.500]  The jury will now decide how guilty.
[02:52:36.500 --> 02:52:39.500]  And we're going to take everything you've got.
[02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:41.500]  And videos of Leticia James giggling.
[02:52:41.500 --> 02:52:42.500]  We're going to get your ass.
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:43.500]  How about that?
[02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:44.500]  Put him in jail.
[02:52:44.500 --> 02:52:45.500]  Yeah.
[02:52:45.500 --> 02:52:46.500]  Woo.
[02:52:46.500 --> 02:52:48.500]  Soon as I get elected, you're going to jail.
[02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:53.200]  Dancing around.
[02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:59.200]  Like in Hop or something, where the head chick, Carlos, is like,
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:02.200]  It's a coup d'etat, which is French for coup d'etat.
[02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:06.200]  We the bosses, we the bosses, and they're just parading.
[02:53:06.200 --> 02:53:12.200]  Like, we can't send F-16s and cruise missiles and Abrams tanks to Ukraine.
[02:53:12.200 --> 02:53:14.200]  That's World War III, just a year ago.
[02:53:14.200 --> 02:53:17.200]  Now, like, hell yeah! And we're going to send British troops to openly fight!
[02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:19.200]  And the Russians are like, OK, we're going to use nukes on you.
[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:22.200]  Well, go ahead! Sean Penn says we can do it!
[02:53:22.200 --> 02:53:25.200]  Well, let's get our nuclear warfare expert up here, Sean Penn.
[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:29.200]  Well, yes, we need to use nuclear weapons. It's quite reasonable. It's quite liberal.
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:34.200]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[02:53:34.200 --> 02:53:37.200]  Crazy people, about to get us all killed.
[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:43.200]  Your Honor, he's got 400 million dollars we have to prove.
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:45.200]  We want him put in jail.
[02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:50.200]  OK, I'll put three outside auditing firms on him.
[02:53:50.200 --> 02:53:54.200]  I think it's been like almost a million dollars the last year we had to pay
[02:53:54.200 --> 02:53:58.200]  for outside accounting firms to literally do proctology exams,
[02:53:58.200 --> 02:54:03.200]  to come and search the underwear drawers at my house, tear out the attic,
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:05.200]  go into all our storage facilities, everything.
[02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:08.200]  Forensic accounting, PIs, investigations,
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:11.200]  and they went, actually, you're owed millions by the IRS,
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:14.200]  and everything you said is true.
[02:54:15.300 --> 02:54:19.300]  Well, just take his banking away then, that'll teach him.
[02:54:20.300 --> 02:54:26.300]  I mean, just mad dogs, crazy megalomaniacs, looney tunes.
[02:54:27.300 --> 02:54:29.300]  Cause they got the country in their hands.
[02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:34.300]  And they're just squeezing, we run you now, you dirty Americans.
[02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:38.300]  But they don't have all the judges, they don't have all the governors, they don't have all the attorney generals.
[02:54:38.300 --> 02:54:45.300]  And the other attorney generals and people are battling them and open criminal investigations into the censorship and control and election meddling.
[02:54:46.300 --> 02:54:49.300]  And the more they tell us Trump's guilty, the more we know he's not.
[02:54:50.300 --> 02:54:57.300]  Any idiot can go, wait a minute, a two acre grass lot down the street from Mar-a-Lago in an area not even as good.
[02:54:58.300 --> 02:55:00.300]  It's the most expensive real estate in Florida.
[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:05.300]  Sold for 50 million dollars, it's 20 acres, 160 something rooms.
[02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:09.300]  On the tax rolls for hundreds of millions.
[02:55:10.300 --> 02:55:13.300]  But it doesn't matter, the judge who looks like the crypt keeper, he says it's fraud.
[02:55:14.300 --> 02:55:16.300]  So he weighs his little magic wandy.
[02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:23.300]  And says we're gonna take everything you got, as if Trump even cares at this point.
[02:55:24.300 --> 02:55:28.300]  And Trump's like, I don't feel bad, I'm not scared, I'm dealing with criminals, they're the ones that ought to watch out.
[02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:31.300]  They're like, gag him, don't let him speak.
[02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:33.300]  He can't call us criminals.
[02:55:34.300 --> 02:55:36.300]  We've indicted him for saying illegals voted in Georgia.
[02:55:37.300 --> 02:55:38.300]  Even though they did on record, the state found they did.
[02:55:39.300 --> 02:55:40.300]  Doesn't matter.
[02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:42.300]  Two men can have a baby.
[02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:44.300]  Here's the clip.
[02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:46.300]  Steve Bannon.
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:53.300]  He's gonna be in trial on Monday in New York City to take his entire company and liquidate it.
[02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:57.300]  What he and his family have worked, I don't know, for 100 years for.
[02:55:58.300 --> 02:55:59.300]  You know what his sin was?
[02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:01.300]  You know what his sin was?
[02:56:03.300 --> 02:56:11.300]  That he worked for President of the United States to thwart the globalist Hillary Clinton and her apparatus.
[02:56:12.300 --> 02:56:19.300]  Merrick Garland, I remember he was gonna be, if she had won, he was gonna be in the Supreme Court for life, a lifetime appointment.
[02:56:20.300 --> 02:56:21.300]  That's Donald Trump's great sin.
[02:56:21.300 --> 02:56:24.300]  And the greater sin was after they stole his second term.
[02:56:28.300 --> 02:56:29.300]  Was to return.
[02:56:31.300 --> 02:56:32.300]  Like Cincinnatus.
[02:56:33.300 --> 02:56:34.300]  From the plow.
[02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:38.300]  He had no incentive to return. None.
[02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:40.300]  Except.
[02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:43.300]  No manifestation in the material world.
[02:56:44.300 --> 02:56:45.300]  Except.
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:47.300]  Except.
[02:56:48.300 --> 02:56:49.300]  To save.
[02:56:50.300 --> 02:56:51.300]  Except to save the Republic.
[02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:56.300]  Guys, find the full clip. That's really powerful. I must have sent you guys a shorter clip. I sent you the wrong clip.
[02:56:57.300 --> 02:56:58.300]  I mean, it's part of the larger clip.
[02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:00.300]  It's about a minute longer than the clip I won. My fault.
[02:57:01.300 --> 02:57:02.300]  There were a bunch of clips. I must have sent the wrong one.
[02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:07.300]  All right, we're gonna go to break. I'm gonna do a little bit more here before we hand the baton to the great Gerald Cilente.

[02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:58.300]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[02:58:59.300 --> 02:59:00.300]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:59:01.300 --> 02:59:04.300]  Look how full this bottle is.

[02:59:21.300 --> 02:59:24.300]  This is 95%.
[02:59:25.300 --> 02:59:29.300]  Super concentrated, so like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[02:59:30.300 --> 02:59:32.300]  It's that powerful, or more.
[02:59:33.300 --> 02:59:35.300]  So they're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:36.300 --> 02:59:47.300]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out for almost 8 months, back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:48.300 --> 02:59:55.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:55.300 --> 03:00:05.300]  Well, people have gotten 3 to 4 to 5 years for just walking through the velvet ropes, waved in by the police for disrupting Congress.
[03:00:06.300 --> 03:00:08.300]  Some have gotten 20 plus years.
[03:00:09.300 --> 03:00:14.300]  When they got hit in the face with tear gas, they pushed a fence.
[03:00:15.300 --> 03:00:16.300]  But...
[03:00:17.300 --> 03:00:18.300]  But...
[03:00:21.300 --> 03:00:29.300]  Jamal Bowman, Republican, excuse me, Jamal Bowman, a representative of a Democrat from New York.
[03:00:31.300 --> 03:00:33.300]  Well, they're saying nothing's going to happen to him.
[03:00:34.300 --> 03:00:38.300]  He thought it was a door handle when he pulled the fire alarm, right when the Democrats were trying to block and delay the vote.
[03:00:39.300 --> 03:00:40.300]  I'm sure it was all just an accident.
[03:00:41.300 --> 03:00:45.300]  And if you think he did it on purpose, well, you're a conspiracy theorist, even though there's video of him doing it.
[03:00:46.300 --> 03:00:49.300]  I guess Republicans can go pull fire alarms too and just say they thought it was door handles.
[03:00:50.300 --> 03:00:51.300]  Here it is.
[03:00:52.300 --> 03:00:59.300]  I don't know Bowman at all, but Jamal Bowman, a congressman from New York, did something that was as bad or worse.
[03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:04.300]  You look at what's happening to the J6ers and they're putting them in jail for years and years.
[03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:06.300]  And this guy pulled an alarm system.
[03:01:07.300 --> 03:01:12.300]  And to show you how corrupt they are, he then said when he got caught, he didn't know he was on tape.
[03:01:12.300 --> 03:01:15.300]  I mean, I know how you can be in the Capitol and not know it, especially after what happened.
[03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:18.300]  And he said, oh, he was trying to get into a door.
[03:01:19.300 --> 03:01:20.300]  He thought he was opening a door.
[03:01:21.300 --> 03:01:22.300]  It was a door two feet away.
[03:01:23.300 --> 03:01:24.300]  He thought he was opening a door.
[03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:27.300]  It's a red box that says fire alarm on it.
[03:01:28.300 --> 03:01:29.300]  He thought he was opening it.
[03:01:30.300 --> 03:01:31.300]  This is the crap.
[03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:33.300]  And then they let him out because he's a Democrat, radical left lunatic.
[03:01:34.300 --> 03:01:39.300]  And he should be prosecuted the same exact way as the J6 people were prosecuted.
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:43.300]  Yeah, I mean, according to that, he needs because somebody could have broke their leg.
[03:01:44.300 --> 03:01:45.300]  They could have stampeded.
[03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:46.300]  It's firing a theater.
[03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:49.300]  He needs the same sentence that Enrique Tarrio got.
[03:01:50.300 --> 03:01:51.300]  What was it?
[03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:52.300]  22, 23 years.
[03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:56.300]  But he won't see anything because they all encourage each other.
[03:01:57.300 --> 03:02:03.300]  They go all over the news and say, we're going to kill Trump on CNN, on MSNBC, former CIA section chiefs.
[03:02:04.300 --> 03:02:05.300]  That's OK.
[03:02:06.300 --> 03:02:09.300]  But then when Trump says, well, Millie told the Chinese he was in command,
[03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:11.300]  it would tell them that we were going to make a military move.
[03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:12.300]  That's treason.
[03:02:12.300 --> 03:02:13.300]  Oh, my gosh.
[03:02:13.300 --> 03:02:14.300]  We got to gag him.
[03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:17.300]  He can't talk about that.
[03:02:18.300 --> 03:02:19.300]  Shut him up.
[03:02:19.300 --> 03:02:20.300]  Shut him up now.
[03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:28.300]  Democrat rep from New York, Jamal Bowman, pulls fire alarm ahead of the House vote on government because he got caught on video.
[03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:33.600]  Right at the key point, they're trying to block the vote.
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:39.600]  Well, it's okay because it was for a good cause.
[03:02:39.600 --> 03:02:45.600]  Kind of like mostly peaceful protests, burning down $2.5 billion of people's houses and businesses
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:49.600]  and all the dozens of deaths, police being shot, citizens being killed.
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:55.600]  Kyle Rittenhouse tries to defend himself from a bunch of convicted criminals and you saw what happened to him.
[03:02:56.600 --> 03:02:58.600]  They didn't control that judge.
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:00.600]  See, they can't stand it.
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:02.600]  You watch that trial, it was completely fair.
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:04.600]  Both sides came in.
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:08.600]  Imagine if the judge would have said, well, I find Kyle Rittenhouse guilty.
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:12.600]  Now the jury will decide how guilty.
[03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:19.600]  And of course, there's a lot of really great memes of Jamal Bowman, the Democrat from New York,
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:23.600]  as the Q shaman pulling the fire alarm.
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:25.600]  Imagine the Q shaman had done that.
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:26.600]  Probably got the death penalty.
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:33.600]  There's also the Halloween costume door handle, which is a fire alarm.
[03:03:33.600 --> 03:03:39.600]  And of course, it's the congressman from New York as Ray Epps.
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:45.600]  A lot of classic stuff out there on that front.
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:51.600]  We're going to come back and talk about the WEF caught orchestrating U.S. border crisis for military bases in Panama.
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:52.600]  It's a big deal.
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:54.600]  It's getting a lot of people's attention.
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:03:59.600]  I didn't get into the geoengineering and some of that big news.
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:04.600]  I didn't get into the spiritual battle that Tucker Carlson is talking about and how we need to brood on death.
[03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:05.600]  Very deep thing he said.
[03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:08.600]  We're going to talk about that tomorrow one way or another.
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:11.600]  A bunch of other casual society WEF news coming out.
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:15.600]  And really the big one I should have led the show with, but we've already said it so many times.
[03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:16.600]  Another warning from Russia.
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:24.600]  You send British troops and Germany starts sending its own cruise missiles in, as their government's calling for.
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:27.600]  We'll just attack the cruise missile factories in Germany.
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:29.600]  And then that's nuclear war.
[03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:40.600]  The head of their parliament, Dmitry Medvedev, says that they'll go ahead and launch nukes into Ukraine on any British forces.
[03:04:40.600 --> 03:04:41.600]  They'll kill British forces.
[03:04:41.600 --> 03:04:44.600]  And the left says, great, let's have a nuclear war.
[03:04:44.600 --> 03:04:45.600]  Absolutely.
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:46.600]  And two men can have a baby.
[03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:47.600]  It's all very reasonable.
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:48.600]  It's all very trendy.
[03:04:48.600 --> 03:04:49.600]  It's all very good.
[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:51.600]  It's all very happy.
[03:04:51.600 --> 03:04:54.600]  It's all very completely insane and psychotic and demonic.
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:56.600]  But as long as it's liberal.
[03:04:56.600 --> 03:05:00.600]  Have you tried taking the real red pill?
[03:05:00.600 --> 03:05:06.600]  A one of a kind heart and brain formula designed exclusively for InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:05:12.600 --> 03:05:20.600]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function and unhealthy aging.

[03:05:28.600 --> 03:05:33.600]  Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine and theobromine.
[03:05:33.600 --> 03:05:41.600]  The energy blend inside the Real Red Pill Plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.

[03:05:59.600 --> 03:06:05.600]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:06:05.600 --> 03:06:07.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.600 --> 03:06:15.600]  Well, the top trends forecaster, the great Gerald Cemente is set to take over here in just a few minutes.
[03:06:15.600 --> 03:06:17.600]  I want to hit a few of the other stories we didn't get to.
[03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:19.600]  We'll cover it a lot more obviously tomorrow.
[03:06:19.600 --> 03:06:23.600]  We're still blessed enough to be here on air, so please pray for us.
[03:06:24.600 --> 03:06:28.600]  I reported on this some last week, but it's back in the news up in Canada.
[03:06:28.600 --> 03:06:37.600]  Trans activist force anthropologist to cancel conference panel discussing the identification of male and female skeletons.
[03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:43.600]  If you now say this is a male, this is a female, that's misgendering some 5,000-year-old skeleton.
[03:06:43.600 --> 03:06:47.600]  And so they want jail time, not just things being canceled.
[03:06:47.600 --> 03:06:48.600]  That is clown world.
[03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:57.600]  Speaking of transgenderism, you know the chef for Big Mike who John Rivers said was a trainee
[03:06:57.600 --> 03:07:02.600]  and who does walk around sometimes with something large bouncing around in his pants.
[03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:03.600]  It's now being reported.
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:05.600]  We'll have more on this for you tomorrow.
[03:07:05.600 --> 03:07:11.600]  A whistleblower from Barack Obama's late chef family has reportedly come forward revealing
[03:07:11.600 --> 03:07:16.600]  that at the time of his mysterious drowning at the Obama's Martin's Vineyard estate,
[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:21.600]  Campbell had been working on a tell-all book to expose the misdeeds of the Obamas.
[03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:26.600]  He is also said to have a years-long sexual relationship with the former president.
[03:07:26.600 --> 03:07:31.600]  This comes at a time shortly after the Larry Sinclair homosexual man alleges that he smoked crack
[03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:34.600]  and had an affair with Obama in 99.
[03:07:34.600 --> 03:07:38.600]  It also fits a similar pattern of a little-known case of a man named Donald Young,
[03:07:38.600 --> 03:07:42.600]  a member of Obama's church, who allegedly had a years-long intimate relationship with him
[03:07:42.600 --> 03:07:45.600]  in the heat of the 2008 campaign.
[03:07:45.600 --> 03:07:49.600]  The night before Young was set to come forward to the American public to expose Obama,
[03:07:49.600 --> 03:07:55.600]  he was mysteriously shot and murdered in cold blood in what was later deemed to be a home invasion in Chicago.
[03:07:55.600 --> 03:07:58.600]  No suspect was ever charged for his murder.
[03:07:58.600 --> 03:08:04.600]  This is a major revelation, and it appears the truth about Barack Obama is finally coming
[03:08:04.600 --> 03:08:06.600]  to the mainstream of the American public.
[03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:13.600]  This begs the question, what really happened to Tafari Campbell's Obama chef and Donald Young?
[03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:15.600]  They deserve justice.
[03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:25.600]  We'll be talking about all of that and a lot more on Tuesday's transmission that kicks off at 11 a.m. Central
[03:08:25.600 --> 03:08:29.600]  right after American Journal with the great Harrison Smith.
[03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:31.600]  Don't forget, 3 p.m. Central.
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:35.600]  Owen Schroer is back in town after spending five days with family in St. Louis,
[03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:41.600]  ahead of having to report to federal prison on or before the 24th of October.
[03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:43.600]  That's within 22 days.
[03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:47.600]  He'll get out after two months, reportedly the night before Christmas, Christmas Eve.
[03:08:47.600 --> 03:08:53.600]  Owen Schroer, soon-to-be political prisoner, 3 p.m. Central in 52 minutes from now.
[03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:58.600]  Please don't forget, the way the clips, the articles, the videos get out is you reposting them,
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:01.600]  you sharing them, you emailing them, you tweeting them, you Facebooking them,
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:03.600]  you sending it to your text message friends.
[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:05.600]  That's the war.
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:07.600]  You're the real power here, not me.
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:08.600]  Share the article.
[03:09:08.600 --> 03:09:09.600]  Share the video.
[03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:10.600]  Share this big breakdown.
[03:09:10.600 --> 03:09:12.600]  Gerald Cilente is about to do.
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:20.600]  And please go to Infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139 and get a book, get a film.
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:25.600]  We've got the new Orange Man political prisoner mugshot shirts, limited edition.
[03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:26.600]  When they're sold out, they're gone.
[03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:28.600]  We only printed, like, 3,000 of them.
[03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:30.600]  That supports the broadcast.
[03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:31.600]  It's a collector's edition.
[03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:36.600]  We've got a bunch of the great products back in stock, like Vitamin Mineral Fusion discounted,
[03:09:36.600 --> 03:09:41.600]  all the Infowars Platinum products back, and the trifecta sale of DNA Force Plus,

[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:53.600]  because we're selling out of one of the products.
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:58.600]  Get 40% off at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[03:10:03.600 --> 03:10:04.600]  Thanks for all you do.
[03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:07.600]  And now I want to thank Gerald Cilente for guest hosting.
[03:10:07.600 --> 03:10:10.600]  The mighty Gerald Cilente takes over now.
[03:10:10.600 --> 03:10:12.600]  Thank you so much.
[03:10:12.600 --> 03:10:15.600]  And, again, everybody, listen to what Alex Jones said.
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:21.600]  Do everything you can to support Infowars because they're doing everything they can to support you.
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:25.600]  And censorship is real.
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:27.600]  I get this crap.
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:33.600]  America fighting all over the world to bring freedom and democracy as they steal it from us.
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:42.600]  And you got that guy, that clown, that arrogant guy, Jamal, what the hell is his name, Bowman?
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:45.600]  Let me get my glasses.
[03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:47.600]  That Alex was just talking about.
[03:10:47.600 --> 03:10:49.600]  Blowman, yeah, maybe.
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:52.600]  Pulled a fire alarm in the House building Saturday.
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:54.600]  This is what he said.
[03:10:54.600 --> 03:11:02.600]  I am embarrassed to admit that I activated the fire alarm mistakenly thinking it would open the door.
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:10.000]  I'm embarrassed to admit. What are you, six years old?
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  If I did it, man, you'd have me locked up.
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  Oh, yeah.
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000]  But don't you know who I am?
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  I'm a shiddiot.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  That's right, I'm a shiddiot.
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:34.720]  I'm a politician and I am a full of crap idiot.
[03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:55.800]  I'm a shit idiot, I'm a politician, I'm full of crap and I'm an idiot and you swallow my crap, you become a good American, you swallow political crap or else we'll send you to jail, or we might kill you.
[03:11:56.800 --> 03:11:58.800]  Oh yeah? That's right.
[03:11:58.800 --> 03:12:00.800]  What did RFK Jr. say?
[03:12:00.800 --> 03:12:09.800]  The CIA killed his uncle, John F. Kennedy, and his father, Robert Kennedy?
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:11.800]  That's right.
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:30.320]  What a jerk, what a jerk, a jerk off over there in D.C., D.C., the capital of shiddiots.
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:36.760]  Politicians full of crap idiots, full of crap idiots.
[03:12:36.760 --> 03:12:41.120]  Hey, we're going to talk about the economy.
[03:12:41.120 --> 03:12:43.960]  This thing's going down big.
[03:12:43.960 --> 03:12:45.520]  And what else is going on?
[03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:50.080]  You know, here's the toilet paper record.
[03:12:50.080 --> 03:13:00.880]  And they talk about what's going on with this dance and what happened with that bill, you
[03:13:00.880 --> 03:13:08.000]  know, the way they're shutting down the government.
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:16.720]  And they call the people, they call the people that are against sending more weapons of
[03:13:16.720 --> 03:13:25.400]  death to Ukraine, right wing, right wing.
[03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:33.600]  Far-right. Far-right. That's the word. Far-right. Far-right? You mean far-right wants peace?
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:38.000]  So here's the story.
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:42.000]  When I was a young guy and the Vietnam War was going on,
[03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  the people that opposed it, they called the far-left.
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:52.000]  Oh yeah, like arrogant Bernie Sanders, a fat little slob.
[03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:56.000]  Oh yeah, who sends all the money he wants to Ukraine.
[03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:58.000]  Oh yeah, but he was against the war.
[03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:01.700]  What happened, Bernie?
[03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:11.480]  All the Republicans that voted to keep sending money so we don't shut down the government.
[03:14:11.480 --> 03:14:13.960]  Yep, yeah, that was the bill.
[03:14:13.960 --> 03:14:17.960]  So they call those that oppose it far right.
[03:14:18.100 --> 03:14:23.860]  How can you make this stuff up?
[03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:28.600]  This is how bad our government has become.
[03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:32.400]  It's a freak show.
[03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:35.400]  They're idiots!
[03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:41.840]  They're full of crap idiots, telling us what to do.
[03:14:41.840 --> 03:14:46.120]  Here's the deal, man, if we don't have a new third party, it's finished.
[03:14:46.120 --> 03:14:47.640]  It's over.
[03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:48.640]  It's gone.
[03:14:48.640 --> 03:14:54.000]  I mean, some of the headlines, like last week, you know, House Representative Gates, whatever
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:15:00.720]  you pronounce his name, amendment to ban transfer of cluster weapons was killed.
[03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:01.880]  Yeah.
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:07.760]  Yep, another bill introduced by GATS would have cut off military support for Ukraine
[03:15:07.760 --> 03:15:08.520]  altogether.
[03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:15.800]  It failed in a vote of 93 to 339.
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:22.400]  The House voted down two amendments aimed at reducing U.S. support for the proxy war
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:24.359]  in Ukraine.
[03:15:24.359 --> 03:15:30.119]  One amendment introduced by Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona to strip $300 million
[03:15:30.119 --> 03:15:38.279]  in industry and military aid for Ukraine included in the Pentagon Appropriations Bill was rejected
[03:15:38.279 --> 03:15:49.840]  in a vote of 104 to 330 and only received support from Republicans.
[03:15:50.900 --> 03:15:57.900]  These aren't liberals that they call them. They're libtards.
[03:15:57.900 --> 03:16:02.900]  They're gutless little boys and girls with bad attitudes.
[03:16:04.300 --> 03:16:10.300]  And we talked, I was talking before about all this transgender crap.
[03:16:10.300 --> 03:16:13.300]  Yeah, oh now you introduce somebody.
[03:16:13.300 --> 03:16:16.300]  Oh, this is my partner. Oh, this is my partner.
[03:16:16.300 --> 03:16:20.300]  You don't say girlfriend or boyfriend or husband or wife anymore.
[03:16:20.300 --> 03:16:21.300]  It's just partner.
[03:16:21.300 --> 03:16:26.300]  So we all could say what we want to say and we could pretend to be whatever we want to be.
[03:16:26.300 --> 03:16:30.300]  Partner? What are you doing, business? Like a business partner?
[03:16:30.400 --> 03:16:36.900]  Not a girlfriend or a boyfriend anymore?
[03:16:36.600 --> 03:16:46.000]  It's a freak show, it's a freak show, who's your favorite freak?
[03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:54.680]  Oh, it was all big news that Dianne Feinstein died, oh my god, oh my god, sucking off the
[03:16:54.680 --> 03:17:00.600]  public tit since 1978, and she got the job because they murdered those other guys, she
[03:17:00.600 --> 03:17:03.600]  was dead a long time ago.
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:09.600]  Oh, that's big news, your mother, your father, your sister, your brother, loved ones die,
[03:17:09.600 --> 03:17:12.600]  who gives a damn, who cares?
[03:17:12.600 --> 03:17:21.600]  Oh, but a senator dies, a senator dies, oh my god, oh my god.
[03:17:22.700 --> 03:17:28.700]  Yeah, Diane Notsofeinstein gone, she should have been gone a long time ago.
[03:17:28.700 --> 03:17:32.700]  All you clowns in there should be gone.
[03:17:32.700 --> 03:17:39.700]  Term limits, you scum. Term limits and go get a real, oh no, you won't get a real job.
[03:17:39.700 --> 03:17:48.700]  Oh, what if they pay Barack Obama's wife like $700,000 to BS for like an hour last week or a couple of weeks ago?
[03:17:49.700 --> 03:17:58.700]  Bill Clinton gets paid $300,000, $400,000 an hour to give a talk to the Goldman Sachs gang and the other guys?
[03:17:58.700 --> 03:18:02.700]  You can hear BS for free all day long.
[03:18:03.300 --> 03:18:13.300]  Oh, this is the United States that kills, slaughters people all over the world in the name of freedom and democracy as they rob it from us.
[03:18:13.300 --> 03:18:16.300]  And that's why I need to support InfoWars.
[03:18:16.300 --> 03:18:19.300]  Look, they're going to blacklist me too.
[03:18:19.300 --> 03:18:22.300]  It's only a matter of time.
[03:18:22.900 --> 03:18:28.900]  Or I may get killed. You saw what happened a couple of weeks ago, a guy tried to break in.
[03:18:28.900 --> 03:18:34.900]  Oh, when I put on the peace rally, guys scream me out there, Putin puppet.
[03:18:34.900 --> 03:18:37.900]  You know, when I went after the guy, he ran away.
[03:18:37.900 --> 03:18:42.900]  You're a 30-year-old guy running away from a guy that's 76 years old.
[03:18:42.900 --> 03:18:46.900]  Come over here and talk to me like that. Come over here.
[03:18:46.900 --> 03:18:50.900]  You always attack the attacker. You don't attack anyone.
[03:18:50.900 --> 03:18:52.900]  So if he came at me.
[03:18:52.700 --> 03:18:58.700]  I would have done what was necessary to protect myself.
[03:18:58.500 --> 03:19:06.100]  So we got to unite, and we need a third party.
[03:19:06.100 --> 03:19:12.580]  I was on Alex Jones, I think it was like January 10th.
[03:19:12.580 --> 03:19:26.500]  I was doing the top trends of 2023, and I said, Alex, the best ticket for president
[03:19:26.500 --> 03:19:34.380]  and vice president of the United States in 2024 is RFK Jr. for president.
[03:19:34.500 --> 03:19:39.500]  And Judge Andrew Napolitano, vice president.
[03:19:41.200 --> 03:19:44.200]  And Alex, boy, he was right on board.
[03:19:44.200 --> 03:19:47.200]  Said a lot of brilliant things supporting what I was saying.
[03:19:47.700 --> 03:19:51.700]  Videos are there, you can watch them.
[03:19:52.700 --> 03:19:58.700]  In April, RFK Jr. announced he was running for president.
[03:19:58.700 --> 03:20:04.700]  And now, on October 9th, he's going to announce...
[03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:13.759]  Now, he's running on a... he already announced he's running as an independent.
[03:20:13.759 --> 03:20:17.240]  And then, on October 9th, he's going to say which party...
[03:20:17.240 --> 03:20:25.920]  Now, remember, I said the Libertarian Party back in January.
[03:20:25.920 --> 03:20:34.000]  And I said that because they have... they're on all the ballots around... across the country.
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:38.560]  And a lot of his... not all of them, but a lot of his stances are in the Libertarian
[03:20:38.560 --> 03:20:39.560]  category.
[03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:41.960]  So, anyway, we'll see what happens there.
[03:20:41.960 --> 03:20:48.759]  You know, I want to talk a little bit about what's going on in the markets.
[03:20:48.759 --> 03:20:53.480]  Yeah, they're down again, no kidding.
[03:20:53.480 --> 03:21:02.279]  Why would you invest in the equity markets when you could get 5% by going into a money
[03:21:02.279 --> 03:21:06.720]  market fund or treasury getting nearly that?
[03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:14.039]  So, as long as interest rates stay high, the markets are going to go down.
[03:21:14.039 --> 03:21:16.240]  And you can go back to July.
[03:21:17.300 --> 03:21:23.660]  I was saying on the air and in our magazine the Trends Journal, and we're
[03:21:23.660 --> 03:21:29.420]  not going to change the name to Trans Journal, and you go to jonestrends.com
[03:21:29.420 --> 03:21:34.500]  and you get a great deal, jonestrends.com, that the markets would go down in
[03:21:34.500 --> 03:21:39.220]  September. And they did.
[03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:43.600]  The Dow lost 3.5 percent.
[03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:48.600]  They said they're going to go down in October.
[03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:51.600]  And today they're down again.
[03:21:51.600 --> 03:22:00.600]  I also forecast that gold prices would go down as the dollar stays strong and interest rates stay high.
[03:22:00.600 --> 03:22:07.600]  I thought gold prices wouldn't go lower than 18.50 an ounce, and now they're in the 18.30s number.
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:13.600]  So I do believe that gold prices are near their bottom.
[03:22:14.600 --> 03:22:17.600]  And gold prices are going to go up.
[03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:20.600]  They're going to skyrocket up when two things happen.
[03:22:20.600 --> 03:22:25.600]  Number one, when they lower interest rates.
[03:22:25.600 --> 03:22:28.600]  When they lower interest rates,
[03:22:28.600 --> 03:22:31.600]  it's going to be the beginning of the death of the dollar.
[03:22:31.600 --> 03:22:35.600]  The dollar is only strong because of high interest rates.
[03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:38.600]  We have a $33 trillion debt load.
[03:22:39.900 --> 03:22:51.900]  And by the way, in this week's Trends Journal, Gregory Manarino writes an important article about global debt load.
[03:22:52.100 --> 03:23:00.100]  So, when they lower interest rates, the dollar goes down, gold prices go up. Simple as that.
[03:23:01.800 --> 03:23:06.800]  The higher interest rates go, the lower gold prices go.
[03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:10.800]  Number two, people know how bad it is.
[03:23:11.800 --> 03:23:25.800]  I bought two bags of grapes, organic grapes. It was like $18. Who could afford this?
[03:23:26.300 --> 03:23:35.699]  It takes 42 weeks to buy off, if you were to pay it off week after week after, 42 weeks
[03:23:35.699 --> 03:23:42.779]  of earnings to buy a new car according to Moody's Analytics, 42 weeks.
[03:23:42.779 --> 03:23:52.460]  Your average median house, median price of a home is about $420,000, $420,000.
[03:23:56.700 --> 03:23:58.700]  What's your median household income?
[03:23:58.700 --> 03:24:01.700]  About $74,500.
[03:24:01.700 --> 03:24:05.700]  And you're going to buy a $420,000 home?
[03:24:05.700 --> 03:24:06.700]  No, you're not.
[03:24:09.800 --> 03:24:21.880]  So, going back, when the markets crash, the people realize how tough life is.
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:25.960]  It becomes a reality when the markets crash.
[03:24:25.960 --> 03:24:29.960]  That makes the headlines, rather than Taylor Swift to Beyonce.
[03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:35.560]  What a joke, what a joke.
[03:24:35.560 --> 03:24:38.720]  Here's Taylor Swift kissing her boyfriend, what are you, what are you, what are you?
[03:24:38.720 --> 03:24:42.080]  Oh, we're the Cartoon News Network, we're CNN.
[03:24:42.080 --> 03:24:50.080]  By the way, they chew the mainstream media, they're shitty-its as well.
[03:24:50.200 --> 03:25:02.200]  Full of crap idiots, and bureaucraps, they too are shitty-its.
[03:25:03.500 --> 03:25:13.860]  Full of crap idiots, they're not idiots, they're full of crap, they got this, oh and they hate
[03:25:13.860 --> 03:25:16.020]  you because you won't swallow their crap.
[03:25:16.020 --> 03:25:22.860]  Hey remember the, remember Fauci, fraud Fauci, again, right in your trends journal we wrote
[03:25:22.860 --> 03:25:26.940]  about that as it was happening, he said people should never shake their hands again.
[03:25:27.100 --> 03:25:34.100]  Here Fauci, don't forget when you masturbate, don't forget to sanitize your hands.
[03:25:35.900 --> 03:25:37.900]  Yeah, there's shitheads too.
[03:25:37.900 --> 03:25:41.900]  Oh, and you know what another class of shitheads are?
[03:25:41.900 --> 03:25:43.900]  Celebrities.
[03:25:43.900 --> 03:25:45.900]  Oh, celebrities.
[03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:49.900]  Like that pencil head, that guy, I forget his name.
[03:25:49.900 --> 03:25:51.900]  Oh, he goes all over supporting war.
[03:25:51.900 --> 03:25:53.900]  Celebrity.
[03:25:53.900 --> 03:25:55.900]  I'm a celebrity.
[03:25:56.300 --> 03:26:04.460]  Another member of the club, as George Carlin said, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:26:04.460 --> 03:26:06.939]  And you have to support InfoWars.
[03:26:06.939 --> 03:26:14.660]  I do everything I can to support freedom, peace and justice.
[03:26:14.660 --> 03:26:18.099]  And InfoWars is on that platform.
[03:26:18.099 --> 03:26:20.779]  So when you're getting the products, you're not only helping yourself, you're helping
[03:26:20.779 --> 03:26:21.779]  them.
[03:26:21.779 --> 03:26:25.420]  And again, if you want to know what in the world is going on, what's next and what to
[03:26:25.420 --> 03:26:30.820]  do, you want the Trends Journal, of course, you go to jonestrends.com, jonestrends.com
[03:26:30.820 --> 03:26:31.820]  and you get a real bargain.
[03:26:31.820 --> 03:26:40.259]  You know, again, I get this, the toilet paper record, the New York Times, $4 a day, $4 a
[03:26:40.259 --> 03:26:41.259]  day.
[03:26:41.259 --> 03:26:46.900]  And again, when I talk about the shiddiots, they destroyed America.
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:51.000]  They destroyed this country.
[03:26:52.500 --> 03:26:58.100]  Here they are talking about sending more weapons of death to Ukraine as the
[03:26:58.100 --> 03:27:04.060]  people in Maui are suffering. Hey, how about all you people in East Palestine, huh?
[03:27:04.060 --> 03:27:08.620]  Yeah, you know, when they spread all that poison from the
[03:27:08.620 --> 03:27:15.260]  crap heads that run the rail system, the arrogant club. Screw you!
[03:27:15.260 --> 03:27:21.820]  What the hell you worth? You're worth nothing! Only for the war machine. Oh, the war machine?
[03:27:21.820 --> 03:27:26.180]  Did you hear about how they're going to build a war machine in Ukraine?
[03:27:26.180 --> 03:27:31.860]  Oh, no? Oh, you didn't know that? That's right.
[03:27:31.860 --> 03:27:38.500]  NATO, they're bringing the military industrial contractors there. Probably
[03:27:38.500 --> 03:27:41.580]  along with the United States.
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  Yep.
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  They destroyed America.
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  The infrastructure is rotting.
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000]  Oh, look at the big news.
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  Oh, it's flooding in New York City.
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  Flooding in New York City.
[03:27:56.200 --> 03:27:59.200]  It's a crap hole.
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:03.200]  And you got crap bowlers in charge.
[03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:06.200]  Oh, remember Warren Williams Jr.?
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:13.200]  Oh, yeah, the arrogant guy that changed his name to Bill de Blasio to get the Italian vote.
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:17.200]  One clown after another.
[03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:20.200]  One clown after another in Congress.
[03:28:20.200 --> 03:28:23.200]  Get in front of you, Mitch McConnell.
[03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:29.200]  Hey, maybe he'll do a double burial with McConnell and Feinstein.
[03:28:29.200 --> 03:28:32.200]  Oh, my God, the senator died.
[03:28:32.200 --> 03:28:36.200]  Big deal.
[03:28:36.200 --> 03:28:41.200]  Oh, you couldn't go see your mother when she was dying because of COVID.
[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:43.200]  That was that was all you could do that.
[03:28:43.200 --> 03:28:44.200]  Senator dies.
[03:28:44.200 --> 03:28:46.200]  Oh, Madonna me.
[03:28:46.200 --> 03:28:47.200]  We'll be right back.

[03:32:28.200 --> 03:32:30.200]  There's no excuse not to get them.
[03:32:30.200 --> 03:32:31.200]  They're so amazing together.

[03:32:58.200 --> 03:33:02.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:02.200 --> 03:33:04.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:25.880]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:25.880 --> 03:33:30.880]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Celente.
[03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:39.680]  Again, do everything you can to support InfoWars because they're doing everything they can
[03:33:39.680 --> 03:33:40.680]  to support you.
[03:33:40.680 --> 03:33:46.120]  Their staff really works hard, as does Alex Jones, to give you, you know, information
[03:33:46.120 --> 03:33:57.240]  and keep pushing for what very few do, freedom, and again, if that should be the candidate's
[03:33:57.240 --> 03:34:03.440]  top campaign message, freedom, freedom, don't tell me who to be, what to be, and what I
[03:34:03.440 --> 03:34:04.440]  should think.
[03:34:04.440 --> 03:34:05.440]  I can think for myself.
[03:34:05.440 --> 03:34:06.560]  I'm not a moron.
[03:34:07.600 --> 03:34:10.600]  I know what I'm talking about. I only write about facts.
[03:34:10.600 --> 03:34:13.600]  So if we want to talk about facts, we'll talk about facts.
[03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:16.600]  Oh, no, not what you just call facts.
[03:34:16.600 --> 03:34:20.600]  What I look at is facts, too, that are contrary to what you're putting.
[03:34:20.600 --> 03:34:22.600]  And so let's go over the data.
[03:34:22.600 --> 03:34:25.600]  Now, data doesn't count.
[03:34:25.600 --> 03:34:29.600]  Only what the government shoves down your throat counts.
[03:34:29.600 --> 03:34:32.600]  So anyway, as you well know, as I said, things are good.
[03:34:32.600 --> 03:34:34.600]  People are going to wake up to this.
[03:34:34.600 --> 03:34:43.600]  Things are good. People are going to wake up to this when they find out when the markets crash, when the economy goes down.
[03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:45.600]  And.
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:51.400]  There's an article in Bloomberg that just came out at the end of the week.
[03:34:51.400 --> 03:34:54.400]  The U.S. consumer is starting to buckle.
[03:34:54.400 --> 03:35:05.400]  Rising gas prices, crimp spending, delinquency rate on credit cards reaches the highest level in more than a decade.
[03:35:05.400 --> 03:35:07.400]  Don't worry about it.
[03:35:07.400 --> 03:35:09.400]  That's all right.
[03:35:09.400 --> 03:35:19.720]  Highest level in almost a decade, yeah, when the Great Recession was just ended and it's
[03:35:19.720 --> 03:35:21.160]  getting worse.
[03:35:21.160 --> 03:35:29.240]  And now, you know, I had a kid growing up as an Italian in New York, oh, the mafia,
[03:35:29.240 --> 03:35:36.560]  hey, they charge, they charge 10% interest on their loan, oh yeah?
[03:35:36.560 --> 03:35:43.240]  What does Citigroup, what does Amex, what do they charge?
[03:35:44.300 --> 03:35:52.300]  27, 25, average right now is 20.5 percent.
[03:35:53.300 --> 03:35:55.300]  Look who's running the country.
[03:35:56.300 --> 03:35:58.300]  Now don't call it a mafia.
[03:35:59.300 --> 03:36:02.300]  Call it a bankster crime syndicate.
[03:36:03.300 --> 03:36:05.300]  Let's call it a spade a spade.
[03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:08.600]  So the people are suffering.
[03:36:11.500 --> 03:36:17.500]  Measure of consumer confidence slumped to a four-month low in September.
[03:36:17.500 --> 03:36:18.500]  Yeah, no kidding.
[03:36:18.500 --> 03:36:24.500]  We said this would happen because it's summertime, summertime, people are feeling good.
[03:36:24.500 --> 03:36:28.500]  And then when the summer ends, reality comes back.
[03:36:28.500 --> 03:36:31.500]  Again, this is Bloomberg.
[03:36:31.800 --> 03:36:35.800]  Outsold purchasing power has already fallen.
[03:36:36.700 --> 03:36:45.060]  With large retailers such as Target Corp seeing a drop in discretionary spending, oh, and
[03:36:45.060 --> 03:36:52.780]  closing down businesses because of violence, stealing.
[03:36:52.780 --> 03:36:55.460]  No one says this.
[03:36:55.460 --> 03:36:57.540]  This did not happen before the COVID war.
[03:36:58.600 --> 03:37:04.600]  I went to buy a toothbrush in CVS, the Oral-B.
[03:37:04.600 --> 03:37:06.600]  They had them locked up.
[03:37:08.100 --> 03:37:11.100]  This didn't go on before the COVID war.
[03:37:11.100 --> 03:37:13.100]  You didn't have people stealing like this.
[03:37:13.100 --> 03:37:16.100]  Oh, and how about the homeless situation, huh?
[03:37:16.100 --> 03:37:19.100]  Again, I have the homeless solution, but
[03:37:19.100 --> 03:37:22.100]  I don't have a solution.
[03:37:22.100 --> 03:37:25.100]  I don't have a solution.
[03:37:25.100 --> 03:37:28.100]  I don't have a solution.
[03:37:28.100 --> 03:37:31.100]  I don't have a solution.
[03:37:31.100 --> 03:37:34.100]  I don't have a solution.
[03:37:34.100 --> 03:37:36.100]  I don't have a solution.
[03:37:23.900 --> 03:37:27.900]  I'm not allowed to talk about it because I'm blacklisted.
[03:37:28.900 --> 03:37:32.900]  That's not racist, blacklisted. I didn't make it up. I'm white listed, okay?
[03:37:34.500 --> 03:37:44.500]  I used to be on Oprah, it's on twice. It's been on CNBC, CBS, Good Morning America, The Today Show, Fox, Fox and Friends.
[03:37:44.500 --> 03:37:49.500]  Over and over and over and over and over. No more.
[03:37:49.500 --> 03:37:57.500]  As I said, on the economic front, no this isn't stagflation, it's not a stagnant economy and higher inflation, it's dragflation.
[03:37:57.500 --> 03:38:04.500]  Oh, can't say dragflation. Oh, remember the word gay used to be happy? Can't say that anymore.
[03:38:04.500 --> 03:38:09.500]  Again, be what you want, do what you want, don't tell me what I have to be or what I have to believe.
[03:38:09.500 --> 03:38:15.500]  Yeah, you listen to all these old jazz songs, so gay, you should be happy.
[03:38:15.500 --> 03:38:18.500]  I mean, they make up words, they don't want to make up anything they want.
[03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:22.600]  It's going back to this economy thing.
[03:38:22.600 --> 03:38:26.600]  The people are suffering and they won't report how bad it is.
[03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:29.600]  And they're bringing it out now.
[03:38:31.100 --> 03:38:35.100]  61% of the people are living paycheck to paycheck.
[03:38:35.100 --> 03:38:37.100]  Got it?
[03:38:37.100 --> 03:38:40.100]  But the rich keep getting richer.
[03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:55.200]  And going back to the COVID war, again, crime wasn't skyrocketing like this in stores.
[03:38:55.200 --> 03:39:00.360]  And the geeks, the first ones that locked down, look what they did to San Francisco.
[03:39:00.360 --> 03:39:02.720]  I left my heart in San Francisco, yeah.
[03:39:02.720 --> 03:39:06.600]  So going back to the homeless solution, they blacklisted me on it.
[03:39:06.600 --> 03:39:12.160]  The homeless solution is this, get them out of the cities.
[03:39:12.160 --> 03:39:16.760]  You're spending all these billions of dollars putting them in shelters and all this other
[03:39:16.760 --> 03:39:18.520]  stupid crap.
[03:39:18.520 --> 03:39:21.920]  Let's build homeless towns.
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:25.280]  We got all this vacant land.
[03:39:25.280 --> 03:39:27.480]  Let's build beautiful homeless towns.
[03:39:28.500 --> 03:39:33.500]  And give them trades, give them things, teach them things to do.
[03:39:33.500 --> 03:39:36.500]  And the ones that are out of their mind that you can't do anything with,
[03:39:36.500 --> 03:39:41.500]  let's build a special place for them and take care of them.
[03:39:42.200 --> 03:39:44.200]  How about that?
[03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:49.200]  To keep homeless people in the cities is stupid moronic.
[03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:51.200]  And you know why it's stupid moronic?
[03:39:51.200 --> 03:39:54.200]  Because they're shiddiots.
[03:39:54.200 --> 03:39:56.200]  Yeah.
[03:39:56.200 --> 03:39:59.200]  Full of crap idiots.
[03:39:59.200 --> 03:40:06.360]  Oh, and all of these people coming into America, I don't want to pay for them.
[03:40:06.360 --> 03:40:11.500]  I remember when I was a kid, they used to talk about my cousin Constantino from Italy.
[03:40:11.500 --> 03:40:14.360]  They couldn't bring him in here because the restrictions were so tight.
[03:40:14.360 --> 03:40:17.360]  Hey, but now anybody can flood in.
[03:40:17.360 --> 03:40:24.960]  And we want as many people as we can because then the more people we have, the less we
[03:40:24.960 --> 03:40:29.080]  have to pay the plantation workers of Slavelandia.
[03:40:29.080 --> 03:40:31.040]  These people work for a lot less money.
[03:40:31.200 --> 03:40:32.200]  Yeah.
[03:40:32.200 --> 03:40:43.200]  And again, I wrote about it in this book, in Trends 2000, international bestseller.
[03:40:43.200 --> 03:40:48.540]  The H-1B visas brought to you by the Obama gang.
[03:40:48.540 --> 03:40:54.120]  This is the beginning of the internet revolution when I wrote this.
[03:40:54.120 --> 03:40:59.840]  It began, the internet revolution really hit mainstream around 1994.
[03:40:59.840 --> 03:41:03.680]  The book came out in 1997.
[03:41:03.680 --> 03:41:08.680]  The crap head that was president of Warner Books held it up for a year, a trend book.
[03:41:08.680 --> 03:41:11.880]  But anyway, it still became a bestseller.
[03:41:11.880 --> 03:41:18.080]  They did the H-1B visas for the same reason they're letting cheap people come in now,
[03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:24.480]  cheap workers, because all of a sudden a high-tech business is booming and people are demanding
[03:41:24.480 --> 03:41:26.640]  high salaries for their computer skills.
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:27.640]  No, no, no.
[03:41:27.640 --> 03:41:32.000]  We'll get them from India, we'll get them from China, we'll get them from anywhere around
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  the world.
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:34.000]  Give them an H-1B visa.
[03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:35.000]  Let them work cheap.
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:45.080]  Oh, and then, and then, then, thanks to the Clinton gang, they send all that manufacturing
[03:41:45.080 --> 03:41:52.720]  things they used to make here, chips, over to China to get cheap labor so they can make
[03:41:52.720 --> 03:41:54.840]  more money on their profits.
[03:41:54.840 --> 03:42:04.680]  Oh, and this crap, this inflation BS bill of Biden, I said, oh, Biden, nothing's changed.
[03:42:04.680 --> 03:42:12.600]  Obama, oh, Biden, Greenberg, Iceberg, it's all the same, the same gang's in charge.
[03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:15.040]  Still the Obama gang.
[03:42:15.040 --> 03:42:19.760]  But anyway, he's giving companies billions of dollars to build ship plants.
[03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:20.760]  This isn't America.
[03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:21.760]  That's fascism.
[03:42:21.760 --> 03:42:23.960]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers.
[03:42:23.960 --> 03:42:28.880]  How about giving billions of people to little people to open up mom and pop shops, or his
[03:42:28.880 --> 03:42:35.400]  and her shops, or her and her shops, or his and his shops, not only to the bigs.
[03:42:35.400 --> 03:42:39.760]  It's fascism, the merger of state and corporate powers.
[03:42:39.760 --> 03:42:46.840]  That's according to Mussolini, a guy that knew a thing or two about fashion.
[03:42:46.840 --> 03:42:52.880]  So again, we're going to take a break, go to InfoWarsStore.com, get what you need, because
[03:42:52.880 --> 03:42:57.240]  they got what you need, and you need InfoWars.
[03:42:57.240 --> 03:43:02.320]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of
[03:43:02.320 --> 03:43:06.520]  supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on, and these are game-changing
[03:43:06.520 --> 03:43:07.520]  products.
[03:43:07.520 --> 03:43:08.520]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[03:43:08.840 --> 03:43:14.840]  These products are incredible, and I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[03:43:14.840 --> 03:43:19.640]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months
[03:43:19.640 --> 03:43:26.640]  are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get three
[03:43:26.640 --> 03:43:29.040]  or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[03:43:29.040 --> 03:43:34.560]  I think we got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[03:43:34.560 --> 03:43:39.360]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in, and we've got about
[03:43:39.360 --> 03:43:45.960]  3,000 bottles of PainMD, an incredible natural pain-reliever situation.
[03:43:45.960 --> 03:43:50.200]  All three of these are back in stock, and they're incredible, and they fund our operation
[03:43:50.200 --> 03:43:53.200]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:58.200 --> 03:44:01.200]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:44:01.200 --> 03:44:03.200]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:44:03.840 --> 03:44:06.840]  It is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:44:06.840 --> 03:44:11.840]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:44:11.840 --> 03:44:15.840]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:44:15.840 --> 03:44:20.840]  When we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:44:20.840 --> 03:44:24.840]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:44:24.840 --> 03:44:28.840]  For myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:44:29.480 --> 03:44:34.480]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:44:34.480 --> 03:44:35.480]  I know you spread the word.
[03:44:35.480 --> 03:44:37.480]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:44:37.480 --> 03:44:38.480]  Keep doing it.
[03:44:38.480 --> 03:44:42.980]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great
[03:44:42.980 --> 03:44:46.480]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:44:46.480 --> 03:44:50.480]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:50.480 --> 03:44:55.480]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[03:44:55.480 --> 03:44:56.480]  will be over.
[03:44:56.480 --> 03:44:57.480]  Please take action now.
[03:44:58.120 --> 03:45:03.120]  My fellow patriots, the Trifecta has not been in stock for years.
[03:45:03.120 --> 03:45:08.120]  Many of these products have been sold out for years, but we've not had all three of

[03:46:58.680 --> 03:47:05.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.680 --> 03:47:26.680]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:28.680 --> 03:47:33.680]  Hey, great being on Alex Jones Show, and as I say, do everything you can to support InfoWars,
[03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:37.680]  because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[03:47:38.320 --> 03:47:44.320]  And again, they're putting Owen in jail for 60 days.
[03:47:44.320 --> 03:47:47.320]  Wait, what is this kind of stupid crap?
[03:47:47.320 --> 03:47:51.320]  You know, there's an article on Wall Street, on Parade.
[03:47:51.320 --> 03:47:53.320]  They do great work.
[03:47:53.320 --> 03:48:00.320]  And they're showing out all the felonies that JPMorgan Chase gets hit with,
[03:48:00.320 --> 03:48:02.320]  and nobody goes to jail.
[03:48:02.320 --> 03:48:05.320]  They pay pennies fine, pennies.
[03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:11.960]  I think they came out with their fines equal, like, 37 cents, you know, from what they, nothing.
[03:48:11.960 --> 03:48:17.960]  But anyway, get the products, and they got a great product sale right now that's,
[03:48:17.960 --> 03:48:21.960]  you know, it's winter time, and it's time to build up your immune system.
[03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:24.960]  And nobody talks about this in the mainstream media, of course,
[03:48:24.960 --> 03:48:28.960]  because all they want you to do is buy what the drug dealers are selling.
[03:48:28.960 --> 03:48:32.960]  I'm sorry, they're called prescription drugs, yeah.
[03:48:33.600 --> 03:48:38.600]  And they have this vitamin-mineral fusion, and it's back in stock.
[03:48:38.600 --> 03:48:40.600]  You're going to get 25% off.
[03:48:40.600 --> 03:48:45.600]  It's been out of stock a while, but it's back now, and for months it's been gone.
[03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:48.600]  And there's no better time, as they said, winter's coming,
[03:48:48.600 --> 03:48:51.600]  to make sure that you're boosting up your natural system
[03:48:51.600 --> 03:48:55.600]  and getting your essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.
[03:48:55.600 --> 03:48:59.600]  And vitamin-mineral fusion, again, it gives you that,
[03:49:00.240 --> 03:49:03.240]  and it's back in stock, 25% off.
[03:49:03.240 --> 03:49:07.240]  And, again, look at the, people, you know, they're working hard,
[03:49:07.240 --> 03:49:11.240]  they're not eating great, you really need this to keep supporting yourself
[03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:14.240]  and do what you can to build up your immune system.
[03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:17.240]  So don't wait until it's out of stock, get it now.
[03:49:17.240 --> 03:49:22.240]  And you go to InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:49:22.240 --> 03:49:28.240]  and get it because you need it, if you think so.
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:32.880]  And, again, you know, Biden, going back to the war,
[03:49:32.880 --> 03:49:36.880]  yesterday he came out and said, you ready?
[03:49:36.700 --> 03:49:51.700]  I want to assure our American allies, the American people, and the people of Ukraine, that you count on our support.
[03:49:51.700 --> 03:50:03.700]  I want to assure our American allies, the American people, and the people of Ukraine, that you count on our support.
[03:50:04.500 --> 03:50:07.500]  I'm an American people.
[03:50:07.500 --> 03:50:10.500]  Can't count on my support.
[03:50:10.500 --> 03:50:13.500]  Why don't we do a poll?
[03:50:13.500 --> 03:50:15.500]  Here's the poll.
[03:50:15.900 --> 03:50:20.900]  Do you support sending
[03:50:23.400 --> 03:50:26.400]  More money to Ukraine.
[03:50:27.400 --> 03:50:30.400]  It's about $130 billion now that's targeted.
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:34.400]  And if they answer yes,
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  can we take it out of your paycheck?
[03:50:39.700 --> 03:50:44.700]  Then see how many answer yes.
[03:50:45.400 --> 03:50:48.400]  It's not my war.
[03:50:48.400 --> 03:50:58.400]  All you little shiddiots, I am an American patriot.
[03:50:59.700 --> 03:51:05.700]  I believe in the founding fathers, George Washington, no foreign entanglements.
[03:51:05.700 --> 03:51:09.700]  This crap's been going on between Ukraine and Russia for centuries.
[03:51:09.700 --> 03:51:17.700]  And again, people have no idea about the United States overthrow of the democratically elected government of Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.
[03:51:17.700 --> 03:51:20.700]  Brought to you by Victoria Nuland.
[03:51:20.700 --> 03:51:25.700]  Catching her on the phone with that other little clown boy of nothing.
[03:51:25.700 --> 03:51:27.700]  A little piece of garbage nothing.
[03:51:27.700 --> 03:51:31.700]  The guy, what's his name?
[03:51:31.700 --> 03:51:33.700]  Jeffrey Pyatt.
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  And Ambassador of Ukraine, S.U. to the EU.
[03:51:44.000 --> 03:51:50.000]  S.U. to the EU. We're going to put Yatsin, this little clown, Yatsinyuk.
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:52:00.000]  They have no idea. So this clown Biden, a little warmonger, loved every war, got five draft deferments.
[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:05.000]  And then when the fourth deferment ran out, he got the fifth.
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:08.000]  He claimed that he couldn't go in because he had asthma as a kid.
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:12.000]  And again, he's a member of the club, so he didn't have to get drafted in the Vietnam War.
[03:52:12.000 --> 03:52:16.000]  But he used to brag about what a great athlete he was.
[03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:19.000]  He goes on to say that.
[03:52:21.400 --> 03:52:38.359]  That the vast majority of both parties support Ukraine and he's urging lawmakers, lawmakers,
[03:52:38.359 --> 03:52:44.000]  little people sucking off the public tit their whole life, to stop playing games and get
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:44.880]  this done.
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:49.000]  Isn't that nice?
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:51.000]  Yep.
[03:52:51.000 --> 03:52:56.520]  No peace protests, nothing.
[03:52:57.700 --> 03:53:09.700]  Biden said we cannot, under any circumstances, allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted.
[03:53:09.700 --> 03:53:12.700]  You will do what I tell you?
[03:53:12.700 --> 03:53:15.700]  I am in charge?
[03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:24.000]  Can you imagine this?
[03:53:24.000 --> 03:53:28.800]  Oh, America that kills people all over the world for freedom and democracy and you got
[03:53:28.800 --> 03:53:30.160]  this crap spewing out.
[03:53:31.300 --> 03:53:35.300]  Yep.
[03:53:35.300 --> 03:53:38.300]  It cannot under any circumstances.
[03:53:38.200 --> 03:53:46.920]  And this is the way the Financial Times sells their propaganda, and I was just saying this
[03:53:46.920 --> 03:53:47.920]  before.
[03:53:47.920 --> 03:53:59.760]  I think I want to say that much of the opposition to helping Keeve, you ready, is from radical
[03:53:59.760 --> 03:54:06.840]  House Republicans who are already unhappy with McCarthy's compromises with the White
[03:54:06.840 --> 03:54:09.920]  House on spending.
[03:54:09.920 --> 03:54:15.480]  Radical House Republicans, and again, I can't stand a Republican, the repulsive kids, or
[03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:16.640]  the Democrats.
[03:54:16.640 --> 03:54:20.440]  I had enough of them, I had enough.
[03:54:20.440 --> 03:54:27.480]  But to call these people who are for peace and don't want to steal our money as our country
[03:54:27.480 --> 03:54:29.040]  is rotting in front of us.
[03:54:29.500 --> 03:54:34.780]  Radical House Republicans!
[03:54:35.000 --> 03:54:44.440]  Then, this is the crap spewing around the world.
[03:54:45.500 --> 03:54:52.500]  Alicia Kearns, a conservative MP who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee in UK,
[03:54:52.500 --> 03:55:01.500]  conceded that optically, that's a quote, the episode was, you ready, a win for Putin.
[03:55:01.500 --> 03:55:13.500]  But maintained she was quote, still reasonably confident of the US delivering everything we need of them, end quote.
[03:55:14.500 --> 03:55:16.500]  Oh, if only women were in charge.
[03:55:16.500 --> 03:55:18.500]  Oh, there'd be peace.
[03:55:18.500 --> 03:55:22.500]  Oh, no, this piece of crap is saying to send more weapons.
[03:55:22.500 --> 03:55:24.500]  Again, I'm tired of this crap.
[03:55:24.500 --> 03:55:27.500]  If only, how come you don't hear that anymore?
[03:55:27.500 --> 03:55:30.500]  Oh, you got that Baerbock over there, the warmonger in Germany,
[03:55:30.500 --> 03:55:34.500]  Evander Leon over there, the other clown in NATO,
[03:55:34.500 --> 03:55:37.500]  Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, Susan Rice.
[03:55:37.700 --> 03:55:48.700]  All walks. Good, bad, and ugly comes in every race, creed, and color, so save it. Don't want to hear it anymore.
[03:55:50.100 --> 03:56:03.100]  Biden in August asked Congress for an additional $24 billion in funding, on top of the $113 billion already approved. Isn't that nice?
[03:56:03.100 --> 03:56:09.100]  Again, all you people in Maui, to hell with you, it's 700 bucks, get the hell out of here.
[03:56:09.100 --> 03:56:14.100]  We've got to give it to the war machine. They're in charge.
[03:56:14.100 --> 03:56:26.100]  Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star president, warned the American people that the military-industrial complex was robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children, and here we are.
[03:56:26.100 --> 03:56:37.100]  And again, I launched Occupy Peace, and I had the most, three buildings on the most historic four corners in America, pre-Revolutionary War buildings, and I bought them.
[03:56:37.100 --> 03:56:42.100]  The only reason I bought them was the seeds of democracy were sown here.
[03:56:42.100 --> 03:56:44.100]  Love it or leave it, no, you leave it.
[03:56:44.100 --> 03:56:50.100]  I'm an American. I'm only me because I'm a Napolitano, born in the Bronx, born to be free.
[03:56:50.100 --> 03:56:54.100]  If I was born in Alta Vila Epina or Vicoquens, that wouldn't be me.
[03:56:54.100 --> 03:56:57.100]  I'm only me because I'm an American.
[03:56:57.100 --> 03:57:03.100]  A dear friend of mine said, Gerald, you've got that beautiful garden, you have all those American flags up there.
[03:57:04.100 --> 03:57:06.100]  Gerald would look a lot better if you took it down.
[03:57:06.100 --> 03:57:07.100]  He's a dear friend of mine.
[03:57:07.100 --> 03:57:09.100]  He only said it to me for nice reasons.
[03:57:11.100 --> 03:57:13.100]  I said, no, I'm keeping them up there.
[03:57:13.100 --> 03:57:16.100]  Okay, people think, everybody thinks you're a Republican.
[03:57:17.100 --> 03:57:23.100]  That's how sick it is, that peace on earth, goodwill to men doesn't count.
[03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:29.100]  And again, you can also, if you want to support peace, go to OccupyPeace.com, OccupyPeace.com.
[03:57:29.100 --> 03:57:34.100]  And remember, support Infowars, because they're doing everything they can to support you.
[03:57:34.100 --> 03:57:41.100]  And if you want to get the Trends Journal history before it happens, you go to Jonestrends.com,

[03:57:43.100 --> 03:57:44.100]  See you soon.
[03:57:45.700 --> 03:57:47.700]  Bodies is back!
[03:57:47.700 --> 03:57:51.700]  The ultimate tumeric product on the market has returned to InfowarsStore.com

[03:57:54.700 --> 03:57:56.700]  Utilized for thousands of years,
[03:57:56.700 --> 03:58:00.700]  tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[03:58:00.700 --> 03:58:04.700]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year
[03:58:04.700 --> 03:58:08.700]  on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of tumeric and its active components.
[03:58:08.700 --> 03:58:11.700]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body,
[03:58:11.700 --> 03:58:13.700]  help boost and support flexibility,
[03:58:13.700 --> 03:58:16.700]  increase mobility, assist in joint function,
[03:58:16.700 --> 03:58:19.700]  bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[03:58:19.700 --> 03:58:24.700]  Regular tumeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[03:58:24.700 --> 03:58:27.700]  but our super powerful extract using Bodies
[03:58:27.700 --> 03:58:31.700]  contains over 95% of the active ingredients in tumeric.
[03:58:31.700 --> 03:58:34.700]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system,
[03:58:34.700 --> 03:58:37.700]  so if you want to put the true power of tumeric to the test,
[03:58:37.700 --> 03:58:38.700]  then look no further.
