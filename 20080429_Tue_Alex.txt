[00:00.000 --> 00:05.680]  people of color. So I ask you, do you honestly believe your statement and those words?
[00:05.680 --> 00:12.120]  Have you read Horowitz's book, Emerging Viruses, AIDS, and Ebola? Whoever wrote that question?
[00:12.120 --> 00:15.920]  Have you read Medical Apartheid? You read it?
[00:15.920 --> 00:27.360]  No questions from the floor. I read different things. As I said to my members, if you haven't
[00:27.360 --> 00:33.480]  read things, based on this Tuskegee experiment and based on what has happened to Africans
[00:33.480 --> 00:40.000]  in this country, I believe our government is capable of doing anything. In fact, one
[00:40.000 --> 00:49.920]  of the responses to what Saddam Hussein had in terms of biological warfare was a non-question
[00:49.920 --> 00:54.880]  because all we had to do was check the sales record. We sold him those biological weapons
[00:54.880 --> 00:59.160]  that he was using against his own people. So anytime a government can put together biological
[00:59.160 --> 01:05.280]  warfare to kill people and then get angry when those people use what we sold them, yes, I
[01:05.280 --> 01:07.080]  believe we are capable.
[01:07.080 --> 01:15.760]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[01:15.760 --> 01:24.200]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:24.200 --> 01:31.000]  The neocons, the establishment liberals, fake conservative ultra-socialists like Neil
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.920]  Borts are twittering around right now, freaking out over Jeremiah Wright and his conspiracy
[01:38.920 --> 01:44.200]  theories of bio weapons programs against the population. There is just tens of thousands
[01:44.200 --> 01:50.440]  of declassified examples of marching our troops into chambers and nerve-gassing murdering
[01:50.440 --> 01:57.600]  our troops with extreme prejudice. That's your government. That's your country. That's
[01:57.600 --> 02:07.040]  how these people operate. And Reverend Jeremiah Wright, I tell you, he's absolutely on target
[02:07.040 --> 02:13.400]  when it comes to this subject. And you just hear that childlike neocon in the audience,
[02:13.400 --> 02:22.120]  that you actually believe this. You're crazy. Our government suckles us and loves us.
[02:22.120 --> 02:32.960]  The government is run by the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, the Saxe-Coburg gothers,
[02:32.960 --> 02:45.560]  the Vatican, a powerful echelon controlled by the Rothschilds. And they love eugenics.
[02:45.560 --> 02:54.480]  They love playing God and they have implanted every man, woman and child of us with extremely
[02:54.480 --> 03:03.280]  powerful cancer-causing viruses, hundreds of them. They are spraying us. They are poisoning
[03:03.280 --> 03:11.560]  our water. And yes, ladies and gentlemen, almost all of these agents and viruses that
[03:11.560 --> 03:20.160]  have been studied are more active on people of color, though they target all Homo sapiens
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.760]  but now that the human genome through its different fronts has gotten everybody's blood,
[03:25.760 --> 03:32.400]  God help us. Go ahead and laugh, cops that are listening. Go ahead and laugh. It's real
[03:32.400 --> 03:39.120]  funny. I know it's real funny. You're in control, aren't you? You're the big bad bosses. No,
[03:39.120 --> 03:44.480]  you're not. You're with us whether you like it or not. You're sitting right in the same
[03:44.480 --> 03:50.600]  seat as Alex Jones and Jeremiah Wright and David Duke. It doesn't matter if you're a
[03:50.600 --> 03:59.440]  Jew, if you're a German, if you're a Gypsy, if you're an Inuit or if you're a Mayan Indian,
[03:59.440 --> 04:07.400]  you are all under attack. There's only a few thousand globalists. Their system is about
[04:07.400 --> 04:14.920]  compartmentalization. That's why it's their symbol, the pyramid. All right, folks, the
[04:14.920 --> 04:18.120]  developments. Jimmy Carter is calling for a new 9-11 investigation. We are changing New
[04:18.120 --> 04:21.880]  York. Gary Hart in this video is going up, coming out saying yes, he did write a letter
[04:21.880 --> 04:28.160]  to Iran warning that the U.S. government may stage attacks. Neocon David Frum, top Neocon
[04:28.160 --> 04:36.480]  strategist, axis of evil speechwriter, assaults. We are changed three times and thank God we've
[04:36.480 --> 04:40.920]  got it on video where they claim that we are changed and grown fangs and cut the heads
[04:40.920 --> 04:47.320]  off of handicapped children. We'll come back and cover it all. Ultramassive transmission.
[04:47.320 --> 05:00.160]  Strap yourselves in. Get ready. It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future,
[05:00.160 --> 05:06.840]  it is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg. Both their objective
[05:06.840 --> 05:12.960]  is world domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the
[05:12.960 --> 05:18.640]  birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity
[05:18.640 --> 05:26.640]  is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.640]  wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[05:31.640 --> 05:35.360]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[05:35.360 --> 05:38.480]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's
[05:38.480 --> 05:45.480]  their after-easy. Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right

[05:53.120 --> 05:57.400]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent? How about chlorides,
[05:57.400 --> 06:03.520]  dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes and more? Even fragrance can indicate the presence
[06:03.520 --> 06:08.800]  of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic. Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[06:08.800 --> 06:13.200]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing,
[06:13.200 --> 06:18.240]  wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.

[07:02.240 --> 07:07.840]  an average of $8,000. If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication and often

[08:41.260 --> 08:44.460]  And he assaulted them three times, slapping them on the side of the face, hitting his
[08:44.460 --> 08:46.860]  camera twice.
[08:46.860 --> 08:51.540]  And of course, the security guard comes over and says that the people politely asking him
[08:51.540 --> 08:55.660]  questions have to go, but at least they didn't taze them or plan they were al-Qaeda.
[08:55.660 --> 09:00.700]  If we didn't have this video, they would guaranteed say on the news that Frum was in a wheelchair
[09:00.700 --> 09:09.260]  and that we are changed was in LA, throwing babies out of incubators, creating WMDs, and
[09:09.260 --> 09:14.820]  of course, barbecuing small children and beating people savagely in wheelchairs and
[09:14.820 --> 09:19.780]  gassing puppies and posting al-Qaeda tapes.
[09:19.780 --> 09:24.660]  This is the government that creates fake gassing puppies, fake al-Qaeda tapes, uploaded by the
[09:24.660 --> 09:27.940]  government admitted, just everything is fake with these criminals.
[09:27.940 --> 09:31.260]  And they just laugh at the American people caught in the left-right paradigm.
[09:31.260 --> 09:36.100]  Now listen, every radio show, liberal, conservative, watch TV, it's all about you decide, the
[09:36.100 --> 09:38.180]  left and the right fighting.
[09:38.180 --> 09:40.300]  The establishment has this simulated fight.
[09:40.300 --> 09:45.900]  We fight with each other like idiots over a left-right system.
[09:45.900 --> 09:47.020]  We just have to get out of it.
[09:47.020 --> 09:49.500]  I know I repeat that over and over again.
[09:49.500 --> 09:54.500]  So we are changed coming up this hour, then in the third and fourth hour, we're going
[09:54.500 --> 09:59.660]  to have G. Edward Griffin, of course, the creature from Jekyll Island fame.
[09:59.660 --> 10:04.900]  He has been making Patriot documentaries for, I don't know, 30, 40 years.
[10:04.900 --> 10:10.420]  And he's going to be in studio with us for an hour and a half today.
[10:10.420 --> 10:15.220]  That is coming up, but in the next hour, I want to get into eugenics, break down the
[10:15.220 --> 10:21.140]  Reverend Jeremiah Wright's comments, but let's play his minute 20 comments at the press club
[10:21.140 --> 10:30.180]  yesterday in response to a question that's got the minion, Al Sharpton, the caricature
[10:30.180 --> 10:36.580]  of a black leader, the cartoon character, who the establishment trot out to make black
[10:36.580 --> 10:39.300]  people look stupid.
[10:39.300 --> 10:45.980]  Let's go ahead and, he's now attacking Reverend Wright, so he's totally under their control.
[10:45.980 --> 10:48.100]  Let's go ahead and play Reverend Wright.
[10:48.100 --> 10:53.460]  In your sermon, you said the government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of
[10:53.460 --> 10:55.780]  genocide against people of color.
[10:55.780 --> 11:00.380]  So I ask you, do you honestly believe your statement and those words?
[11:00.380 --> 11:05.340]  Have you read Horowitz's book, Emerging Viruses, AIDS, and Ebola?
[11:05.340 --> 11:06.820]  Whoever wrote that question?
[11:06.820 --> 11:08.420]  Have you read Medical Apartheid?
[11:08.420 --> 11:09.420]  You read it?
[11:09.420 --> 11:17.180]  No questions from the floor.
[11:17.180 --> 11:18.500]  I read different things.
[11:18.500 --> 11:25.220]  As I said to my members, if you haven't read things and you can't, based on the Tuskegee
[11:25.220 --> 11:29.260]  experiment and based on what has happened to Africans in this country, I believe our
[11:29.260 --> 11:31.340]  government is capable of doing anything.
[11:31.340 --> 11:42.420]  In fact, in fact, in fact, one of the responses to what Saddam Hussein had in terms of biological
[11:42.420 --> 11:46.820]  warfare was a non-question, because all we had to do was check the sales record.
[11:46.820 --> 11:51.780]  We sold him those biological weapons that he was using against his own people.
[11:51.780 --> 11:56.740]  So any time a government can put together biological warfare to kill people and then
[11:56.740 --> 12:03.380]  get angry when those people use what we sold them, yes, I believe we are capable.
[12:03.380 --> 12:04.380]  Now let me make this clear.
[12:04.380 --> 12:07.780]  I'm going to spend more time on it next hour.
[12:07.780 --> 12:12.060]  Jeremiah Wright is not under the control of the New World Order.
[12:12.060 --> 12:16.820]  Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are.
[12:16.820 --> 12:23.220]  You see Al Sharpton dresses like a clown, acts like a clown, gets everybody fired up and
[12:23.220 --> 12:25.620]  creates racial tension.
[12:25.620 --> 12:27.140]  He's on Fox News singing in.
[12:27.140 --> 12:32.980]  He does global warming, global government tax ads with Pat Robertson.
[12:32.980 --> 12:35.980]  He is their creature.
[12:35.980 --> 12:36.980]  Jeremiah Wright is not.
[12:36.980 --> 12:41.740]  Do I agree with Jeremiah Wright that all evil flows from the white eat?
[12:41.740 --> 12:42.740]  No.
[12:42.740 --> 12:46.060]  But do I think Jeremiah Wright is controlled by the New World Order?
[12:46.060 --> 12:49.140]  No, I think overall the guy means well.
[12:49.140 --> 12:51.020]  Does that mean Barack Obama is good?
[12:51.020 --> 12:52.020]  Absolutely not.
[12:52.020 --> 12:59.180]  Barack Obama became a state senator by playing politics in his community with the angry somewhat
[12:59.180 --> 13:07.540]  informed compared to the white population, black population in the Chicago area.
[13:07.540 --> 13:13.500]  I get a lot of correspondence over my 12 years on air from blacks in Illinois, in Chicago,
[13:13.500 --> 13:21.420]  in Detroit, particularly in New York, in San Francisco, but predominantly Detroit, Michigan,
[13:21.420 --> 13:23.420]  places like Chicago, Illinois.
[13:23.420 --> 13:29.620]  They know all about it and they knew 50 years ago because the illusion of freedom and liberty
[13:29.620 --> 13:32.820]  has not been there for them and they're more down to earth.
[13:32.820 --> 13:36.940]  Does that mean that they don't buy into government and government handouts which are designed
[13:36.940 --> 13:39.460]  to carry out eugenics operations for them?
[13:39.460 --> 13:43.460]  Barack Obama is going to give you free health care and nothing is free in this world.
[13:43.460 --> 13:48.620]  Just to take your children, CPS your children and carry out eugenics against you.
[13:48.620 --> 13:56.260]  There was 90% African American, if you want to use that term, black American legitimacy
[13:56.260 --> 14:00.660]  50 plus years ago, 55 years ago.
[14:00.660 --> 14:06.580]  Now there's 91% illegitimacy and the stated goal of the welfare was to break your families
[14:06.580 --> 14:08.100]  up.
[14:08.100 --> 14:13.300]  They bring the women into the house and they keep the men in the prison out in the barn.
[14:13.300 --> 14:17.540]  And the women, the black women rule over you.
[14:17.540 --> 14:20.900]  It's the same thing with modern feminism.
[14:20.900 --> 14:24.260]  Women don't end up really ruling anything, they just rule over you.
[14:24.260 --> 14:27.660]  That just means they end up fighting with you 24-7.
[14:27.660 --> 14:36.060]  All scientifically done, you can go read Julius Caesar's 2000 year old book, 2048 years, 49
[14:36.060 --> 14:37.700]  years old.
[14:37.700 --> 14:42.100]  The Battle for Gaul, you can go read that book written by Julius Caesar where he talks
[14:42.100 --> 14:47.040]  about how they would use the Germanic women and place them over the men.
[14:47.040 --> 14:48.980]  This wasn't figured out yesterday.
[14:48.980 --> 14:53.300]  The elite didn't fall off a turnip truck yesterday.
[14:53.300 --> 14:59.540]  They run things because they know how to play us.
[14:59.540 --> 15:01.900]  Are you happy women?
[15:01.900 --> 15:11.220]  Feminisms made you nothing but sexual objects, destroyed you, made you unhappy, alone, sterilized.
[15:11.220 --> 15:17.700]  The joys, the wonders of being the center of the household with the children.
[15:17.700 --> 15:21.940]  Men and women of the same species, we form the species.
[15:21.940 --> 15:25.860]  We are totally connected but they teach you the opposite that we're competing with each
[15:25.860 --> 15:26.860]  other.
[15:26.860 --> 15:28.620]  And now you are distruto.
[15:28.620 --> 15:36.140]  Now you are destroyed.
[15:36.140 --> 15:41.180]  And so Barack Obama, he's handled by David Rockefeller, by Zbigniew Brzezinski, by the
[15:41.180 --> 15:44.300]  Trilateral Commission, by the CFR.
[15:44.300 --> 15:53.140]  Barack Obama has gone over to the New World Order.
[15:53.140 --> 15:54.140]  But it won't matter.
[15:54.140 --> 15:57.620]  You'll be conned one more time.
[15:57.620 --> 16:00.860]  You'll go for a ride one more time, won't you?
[16:00.860 --> 16:02.140]  It doesn't matter.
[16:02.140 --> 16:13.020]  Hillary, McCain, Obama, there is no lesser of three evils.
[16:13.020 --> 16:14.820]  They own them.
[16:14.820 --> 16:17.020]  They own all three fighters.
[16:17.020 --> 16:21.060]  They own all the horses.
[16:21.060 --> 16:28.340]  They don't own Ron Paul, so in a major state yesterday, he won the delegates and the party
[16:28.340 --> 16:33.060]  leadership just closed it and said, we don't care, you don't win, and we aren't following
[16:33.060 --> 16:34.300]  state law.
[16:34.300 --> 16:35.540]  And they said, we rule.
[16:35.540 --> 16:40.340]  And if you don't like it, we'll call men in here in black uniforms, which they admit
[16:40.340 --> 16:41.980]  are for intimidation.
[16:41.980 --> 16:43.100]  They said, we'll call police.
[16:43.100 --> 16:44.100]  Get out of here.
[16:44.100 --> 16:45.100]  It's over.
[16:45.100 --> 16:47.940]  We don't care how you vote.
[16:47.940 --> 16:48.940]  You don't like it.
[16:48.940 --> 16:54.660]  We'll shove a gun barrel down your throat and blow your brains all over the wall.
[16:54.660 --> 16:57.420]  This is land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[16:57.420 --> 17:00.860]  This is land of the bio weapon attack.
[17:00.860 --> 17:06.260]  This is the country where they attack us all and poison us from birth and murder you with
[17:06.260 --> 17:07.380]  pleasure.
[17:07.380 --> 17:08.380]  There's cops out there.
[17:08.380 --> 17:15.500]  Your mama, your daddy, statistically, chances are died of the cancer, died of the chemicals
[17:15.500 --> 17:18.140]  they put in your water and your food and your vaccines.
[17:18.140 --> 17:21.220]  You sat there while your mama died.
[17:21.220 --> 17:23.300]  You're still going to put on that black uniform.
[17:23.300 --> 17:24.860]  You're still going to run checkpoints.
[17:24.860 --> 17:32.940]  You're still going to shove people around because just like police commissioner Richard
[17:32.940 --> 17:41.540]  in Louisiana for five days, his elderly mother was in the, was in the nursing home.
[17:41.540 --> 17:44.620]  And they were calling from the nursing home for help, but he was ordered to stand down
[17:44.620 --> 17:46.940]  and not go in.
[17:46.940 --> 17:50.140]  And he sat there and watched his mother die.
[17:50.140 --> 17:52.660]  And then he later cried about it on TV.
[17:52.660 --> 17:55.100]  I'm not somebody who shoots my mouth off or is looking for violence.
[17:55.100 --> 17:58.340]  In fact, I speak out against it, but let me tell you something.
[17:58.340 --> 18:00.140]  My mother's sitting there dying.
[18:00.140 --> 18:01.940]  People try to stop me from going and getting her.
[18:01.940 --> 18:08.020]  There's going to be hell to pay, but you cops, you'll sit there while your mother dies.
[18:08.020 --> 18:13.500]  Your mother means nothing to you next to that black uniform and your petty power trip.
[18:13.500 --> 18:18.500]  And your children mean nothing to you next to the government and your worship of lies
[18:18.500 --> 18:24.100]  and your worship of pettiness and your worship of fraud.
[18:24.100 --> 18:30.260]  I heard that scumbag Neil Bortz today, that fake conservative, that Judas go, he's a smart
[18:30.260 --> 18:31.260]  guy.
[18:31.260 --> 18:32.260]  He knows what he's doing.
[18:32.260 --> 18:36.540]  Posing as a libertarian, posing as a conservative, talking about, Oh, the liberals are trying
[18:36.540 --> 18:37.540]  to get us.
[18:37.540 --> 18:38.820]  The liberals are coming, but it's okay.
[18:38.820 --> 18:45.820]  We'll all stick together as conservatives, total bull.
[18:45.820 --> 18:50.660]  They only talk the talk, they don't walk the walk.
[18:50.660 --> 18:54.340]  Same thing with Barack Obama.
[18:54.340 --> 19:01.020]  He's bought and paid for.
[19:01.020 --> 19:12.700]  Just as sure as George Bush is a blue-eyed devil, Barack Obama is a mulatto devil.
[19:12.700 --> 19:16.500]  It doesn't matter if somebody's half Native American and half wider of their black and
[19:16.500 --> 19:19.980]  Chinese, they can be able or they can be good.
[19:19.980 --> 19:25.180]  There's good and there's evil and the color of his skin has nothing to do with anything
[19:25.180 --> 19:30.220]  but the distraction and the diversions that we live under.
[19:30.220 --> 19:42.300]  We'll be right back with Stuart Howe, who bravely stood up to the pit demon, Mr. Frum
[19:42.300 --> 19:54.860]  and was assaulted by him, be right back.
[19:54.860 --> 19:57.540]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[19:57.540 --> 20:02.380]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the
[20:02.380 --> 20:07.020]  cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[20:07.020 --> 20:12.260]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your entire system are
[20:12.260 --> 20:14.900]  totally unnecessary?
[20:14.900 --> 20:17.700]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die.
[20:17.700 --> 20:21.020]  With laced med inks, patented methodology.
[20:21.020 --> 20:26.380]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and
[20:26.380 --> 20:32.660]  breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[20:32.660 --> 20:34.980]  Laser technology at its best.

[20:53.940 --> 20:58.180]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[20:58.180 --> 21:02.660]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[21:02.660 --> 21:08.740]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[21:08.740 --> 21:11.900]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:11.900 --> 21:17.820]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[21:17.820 --> 21:22.260]  of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.260 --> 21:27.300]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[21:27.300 --> 21:31.580]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[21:31.580 --> 21:34.260]  The Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[21:34.260 --> 21:37.380]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[21:37.380 --> 21:38.380]  They're after power.
[21:38.380 --> 21:39.380]  That's their affidavit.

[21:51.020 --> 21:52.220]  You have been warned.
[21:52.220 --> 21:55.260]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[21:55.260 --> 21:58.660]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what
[21:58.660 --> 22:02.740]  is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[22:02.740 --> 22:06.380]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce
[22:06.380 --> 22:10.060]  and it has now finally caught up with us, and the U.S. commodities such as flour and
[22:10.060 --> 22:13.740]  rice are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another four
[22:13.740 --> 22:15.260]  to five months.
[22:15.260 --> 22:18.620]  It's fall in the southern hemisphere and many countries are short the food necessary to
[22:18.620 --> 22:22.860]  make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[22:22.860 --> 22:24.540]  Remember our trade deficit?
[22:24.540 --> 22:27.740]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy
[22:27.740 --> 22:30.100]  our food production at any price.
[22:30.100 --> 22:34.220]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food
[22:34.220 --> 22:36.580]  and food exports under martial law.

[22:59.180 --> 23:00.700]  hour there is hope.
[23:00.700 --> 23:03.740]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[23:03.740 --> 23:07.980]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[23:07.980 --> 23:09.500]  World Order master plan.

[25:37.940 --> 25:43.980]  Yeah, well a following after meeting with him at a book signing a couple of months ago
[25:43.980 --> 25:49.740]  We knew he was going to be here today. Hmm. Excuse me and you know a few of us Katie and I and
[25:50.300 --> 25:53.620]  Jeremy were on site doing outreach, and we thought we'd go talk with him and
[25:54.180 --> 25:57.940]  Sort of you know get his take on if he's worried about the repercussions
[25:58.860 --> 26:03.020]  You know of as the story falls apart the official 9-11 narrative
[26:03.020 --> 26:10.540]  If he was worried, you know because he's sort of you know runs in the circles of the Neoconservatives about repercussions
[26:10.660 --> 26:16.620]  You know after the fact being culpable in the cover-up, and we just wanted to get his take and we wanted to have a little
[26:16.740 --> 26:18.740]  You know a civil conversation and
[26:19.300 --> 26:25.060]  See what his concerns were and it was kind of a playful tone leading in because he had joked with us
[26:25.060 --> 26:32.020]  You know we think he should be on medication. You're all lunatic sort of thing and you know you can't take that seriously because you
[26:32.980 --> 26:37.260]  Know we're we're we're just looking for the truth, and we're trying to say to him
[26:37.260 --> 26:42.820]  You know are you on medication then you later go to where he's out of he's just given a speech then you go to where he's
[26:43.020 --> 26:47.380]  Doing book signings. No one's there to sign the books you walk up and politely say hey
[26:47.380 --> 26:51.500]  How you doing and then he starts freaking out comes over slaps your camera
[26:51.500 --> 26:55.980]  Then they have these local minions walk over and say there's no First Amendment. You've got to leave
[26:55.980 --> 27:02.460]  He's allowed to assault you these women then a security guard comes over he comes over and slaps you again slaps you again hits you
[27:02.660 --> 27:04.660]  attacks the camera and
[27:05.780 --> 27:12.460]  He but I mean he just is a nitty chicken neck though, and that's how all these guys are just a spirit of
[27:13.340 --> 27:14.820]  chicken-necked weakness
[27:14.820 --> 27:18.740]  Came through but it was also just kind of like a little vampiric goblin
[27:18.740 --> 27:21.820]  I mean for those who haven't seen the video would you like to describe his demeanor?
[27:23.340 --> 27:30.140]  Yeah, vampiric goblin that pretty much sums it up. He's you know, he's laughable in his present
[27:30.140 --> 27:32.700]  I mean he's like shmeagol or golem. He has that
[27:33.180 --> 27:37.580]  Exactly. I was thinking also like Renfrow, you know the guy who go up front for
[27:38.100 --> 27:41.140]  for Dracula and yeah, Renfield
[27:42.020 --> 27:44.020]  Renfield that's that Renfield
[27:44.020 --> 27:50.140]  So yeah, that's that's pretty much it. I mean, he's just he's a you know kind of a has a very pathetic sort of a
[27:50.700 --> 27:56.180]  Presence and I just wanted to you know come back and and chat with him and
[27:56.740 --> 28:03.580]  He you know, he just revealed himself as what he was and you know, I I wasn't approaching him
[28:03.580 --> 28:06.900]  I stood there and he came at me and I was even backed up and when he
[28:06.900 --> 28:13.260]  Me you know knocked me a bit you could hear the impact on the camera a couple of times and it was just unbelievable
[28:13.940 --> 28:18.980]  To see you know that kind of a reaction to you know a citizen just now
[28:19.020 --> 28:22.620]  Now if you wouldn't have had video of this it would be on news now
[28:23.180 --> 28:25.220]  That you would attack someone in a wheelchair
[28:26.380 --> 28:32.780]  That that you would have been screaming and cussing would have said David from innocently sat there with a friend in a wheelchair
[28:32.780 --> 28:38.660]  As you stabbed them with butcher knives covering yourself in blood like the movie carry howling
[28:39.020 --> 28:43.020]  Demonically possessed while dogs were gassed and while WMD's were created
[28:43.740 --> 28:48.580]  Well, you're right Alex and that was part of you know, why did you throw the babies out of incubators?
[28:49.700 --> 28:54.740]  Exactly, that's exactly it and because this is following on the heels of the incident with
[28:55.340 --> 29:01.140]  Matt and Gary in New York. It was completely, you know hoax, you know, we we really wanted to
[29:01.140 --> 29:03.140]  Kind of do our part
[29:03.140 --> 29:05.700]  We wanted to kind of carry the torch over on and by the way
[29:05.700 --> 29:10.740]  We're getting those surveillance tapes and the hoax will be exposed and you are going to be litigated against New World Order
[29:12.180 --> 29:17.380]  That's excellent, and I'm really happy to just this showed how they actually are when there is a camera running

[34:25.900 --> 34:31.900]  That just brings the crisis to a head forces you to come out in the open
[34:31.900 --> 34:35.900]  Go ahead gear up for martial law
[34:35.900 --> 34:39.900]  Go ahead and hire millions more police hand out machine guns to all of them
[34:39.900 --> 34:43.900]  Go ahead and start a bunch of wars
[34:43.900 --> 34:49.900]  This time we're going to meet you and your wind up toys
[34:49.900 --> 34:53.900]  Here's the bottom line
[34:53.900 --> 34:57.900]  What steward howe
[34:57.900 --> 35:01.900]  Luke Radowski Sabrina Rivera
[35:01.900 --> 35:11.900]  And countless others that come out the street actions like Daniel Sinjata and so many others are doing is what's going to defeat the new world order
[35:11.900 --> 35:21.900]  They're not it just afraid that we're exposing the 9-11's an inside job and confronting their minions everywhere and then putting it on the web for hundreds of thousands of views per confrontation
[35:21.900 --> 35:25.900]  Millions in some cases
[35:25.900 --> 35:33.900]  They're afraid just of the paradigm of their stage town halls and their staged events being disrupted being broken down
[35:33.900 --> 35:39.900]  They don't care about some mass protest or demonstration they can provocateur and ignore in the media
[35:39.900 --> 35:58.900]  But they are afraid of you individually going out and confronting your state senators and state reps and mayors and police chiefs and U.S. senators and former presidents and neocon and liberal and establishment strategist
[35:58.900 --> 36:14.900]  They're afraid of you going to all these small medium and large events and confronting Hillary and Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and John McCain and injecting 9-11 truth and North American Union truth and anti-war truth into their parades
[36:14.900 --> 36:32.900]  They're afraid of being on their little propaganda adventures showing it's just like in the parable of the emperors new clothes the emperor has been scammed by these con artists that come to town and we for him the most beautiful cloak
[36:32.900 --> 36:45.900]  When they tell him that only a royal can see its true beauty and only someone of incredible taste can see the beauty that commoners can't even see it and so the king doesn't want to say that he doesn't see it unless he not be stylish
[36:45.900 --> 37:02.900]  Unless he not be cool the emperor must be cool and so he comes out in his underwear at a parade marching only in a loincloth and the thousands of people don't want to boo or laugh at the king you'd be sent to the tower
[37:02.900 --> 37:19.900]  The emperor the king he will say off with your head until a five-year-old steps out and laughs and says the emperor has no clothes and so we go out to these events and we say you have no clothes David from Richard Pearl Zabigniew Brzezinski,
[37:19.900 --> 37:39.900]  Vicente Fox on and on and on and on and on and on and on Arnold Schwarzenegger hey Arnold you got your Nazi belt buckle on Arnold your dad and when he died his stepfather your mother married another second command Nazi
[37:39.900 --> 38:03.900]  You said you admire Hitler why don't you talk about it and Schwarzenegger it's not in a movie he totals on his arthritic legs with his rotten steroid bloated heart stumbles totals forward acting tough putting a silver back great ape face on to look dominant for the population
[38:03.900 --> 38:20.900]  as the behavioral psychologists have told him to do toddling scared you ever watch Schwarzenegger and raw footage we have toddling on his legs toddling you know what growth hormone and steroids do over 1520 years
[38:20.900 --> 38:34.900]  got a heart three times the size of a regular one see it's all rotten it's a simulation of manhood simulation of strength it's a guy who posed and gay porno mags well that's real manly
[38:34.900 --> 38:54.900]  toddling around his rotten knees with his rotten heart with his little Nazi belt buckle I mean how juvenile is that I got over skulls and death being cool when I was about 14 you know what's cool
[38:54.900 --> 39:12.900]  the power of a woman to create life you know what's cool is mountain pools and as I said little speckled green fish swimming in circles shooting stars
[39:12.900 --> 39:27.900]  fields of wheat not some coward chicken neck like Arnold Schwarzenegger I'm sorry I'm making our guest over going to him right now but they are changing the world this is where you should put all your energies 911 truth
[39:27.900 --> 39:38.900]  is in the confrontations you know I have said for years hey let's send Bob Daisy to confront chairman King they wanted me to go I said Bob why don't you go and set my crew put that loose change final cut
[39:38.900 --> 39:50.900]  911 commission or hey guys why don't you I haven't I didn't know I wrote the book on confronting these politicians 12 years ago 13 years ago 10 years ago I'm glad it's been picked up on
[39:50.900 --> 40:02.900]  but you it's so important that I'm going to take time out now to go and do what I've done in the past because that's so important I don't want to just leave it to everybody else I wanted you to get the attention and stand up and do it and you've done it
[40:02.900 --> 40:12.900]  but we should all do it we shouldn't count on others sure we should promote books about 911 long as they don't promote eugenics agendas
[40:12.900 --> 40:30.900]  and we should promote videos about 911 and we should all of those are effective and great and good videos the most effective but when it comes to hijacking in the info war their fake media events this is the most powerful effective tool we've got
[40:30.900 --> 40:44.900]  I told Daniel Sinjati was asking if he was going on the phone so what do you think ought to do what do you think is most effective I said Daniel go with these young men and women and confront people having a TV star having a good looking smart guy like you out there with them
[40:44.900 --> 40:58.900]  you know that's the type of thing I think I'm going to try to get Charlie Sheen to go do some confrontations he's a pretty private guy but boy that would be great you know we need to we need to people standing up getting involved getting out there this is integral
[40:58.900 --> 41:07.900]  Luke told me a year and a half ago he said I'm going to start going out and confronting people and I said Luke I said this is going to be big you're in New York I said if you really do what you say you're going to do it's going to be huge
[41:07.900 --> 41:18.900]  it's going to spread across the world he said no it won't he goes but I'm just going to do this myself and I said no it will because people make fun of you for being young and make fun of your New York accent so what
[41:18.900 --> 41:31.900]  but you've got a spirit of strength and I know leadership when I see it and look what Luke's done and look what we are changing New York has done and all the attacks and the setups and everything else and look at how it's spread and I come in we are
[41:31.900 --> 41:56.900]  changing Netherlands, Japan, UK, Ireland, Canada, all of you and the 9-11 groups and the Info Warriors and the Truth Action groups and Cosmo and all these people intensify your operations, redouble, re-triple. I'm going to go to Luke Radowski now and we're going to bring Stuart Howe up in a moment who was attacked by David from the demon.
[41:56.900 --> 42:06.900]  When you get close to these people you realize they're cowardly weak people. When you get up close to Schwarzenegger you realize he's nothing but a weak coward posing as a tough guy.
[42:06.900 --> 42:14.900]  When you get around Bill Clinton you realize he's nothing but I mean I don't like crowds of people adoring me and loving me in the petty way.
[42:14.900 --> 42:27.900]  I like meeting with good people but I don't like being told how great I am. I don't like I'm a private person. See these neocons, these globalists they love going to crowds. They love being adored. They need that. They're weak. They're evil.
[42:27.900 --> 42:43.900]  See good people want to be left alone. That's why evil always takes over. Until it gets so dark and so bad, good have to stand up just to survive. Then we kick the evil's butt. If we're not co-opted by the evil and manipulated by their propaganda to go attack innocent people believing we're fighting evil.
[42:43.900 --> 42:54.900]  They operate because they have good, well-meaning, good-hearted people serving them at every strata of police, military, government, corporate.
[42:54.900 --> 43:04.900]  They've been deceived and it's hard to admit you've been deceived. Luke Radowski you talked to the vice, I mean to the president yesterday. You also talked to Gary Hart. That's really the biggest news.
[43:04.900 --> 43:14.900]  You've been so busy trying to get the video up that the Gary Hart isn't up yet. You're editing this, uploading it, going out and doing the confrontations, trying to go to college at the same time.
[43:14.900 --> 43:27.900]  I've told you your work's so important, just abandon college, but then you're also having to work a job, trying to get people to send you money so you can do this full time. You also need to raise money for Gary Talas' defense in this neocon setup.
[43:27.900 --> 43:43.900]  How many money to sue them? It's incredible. Luke Radowski, tell us about, in all detail, the video of that's up and then the Gary Hart. First tell me about the president, then tell me your take on what's happening with Fromm, then the huge Gary Hart developments.
[43:43.900 --> 43:54.900]  Well, of course, we did see Jimmy Carter last night at the Barnes and Noble when he was doing a book signing yesterday and we asked him very pivotal questions about his role setting up the Taliban.
[43:54.900 --> 44:10.900]  We asked him pivotal questions about Bush staging a false flag to get into Iran. You can see his answers on our YouTube video on WeAreChanged.org and it was pretty telling where he said, yeah, I was where he'd six months ago with a false flag happening for an attack on Iran to occur.
[44:10.900 --> 44:21.900]  And that was pretty telling for a former president to say that there might be a false flag provocateur attack that may lead into the Iran war.
[44:21.900 --> 44:29.900]  And then we asked him questions about not 11 and you can see the video up there. But people, I just wanted to say, you haven't seen half of it yet.
[44:29.900 --> 44:37.900]  We still got seven videos that we are yet to release because we're so busy here. I'm going to school full time. Luckily, I'm not working yet, but I'm going to school full time.
[44:37.900 --> 44:50.900]  Look, I don't mean to be mean here. This is history. I quit school two years into it. I'm just saying this on air. What are you going to school for?
[44:50.900 --> 44:52.900]  Political science.
[44:52.900 --> 45:03.900]  You're going to learn false political paradigm in those schools. Schools are just fronts now to launder money and to create giant cash funds for investment.
[45:03.900 --> 45:12.900]  The universities don't even exist anymore unless you're in engineering or electrical engineering or software design. I mean, it's not even real.
[45:12.900 --> 45:18.900]  I just look your work is so important. We need to get these videos out. I'm telling you, you need to. I've told you this privately.
[45:18.900 --> 45:24.900]  It's all the young people. This is a war. This is martial law. This is the globalist taking over. We're under eugenics attack.
[45:24.900 --> 45:35.900]  I don't want to just, but it doesn't matter. Just just just tell folks also Gary, the wicked wheelchair attacker, according just like Saddam, through babies out of incubators, total lie.
[45:35.900 --> 45:41.900]  He asked the president three times, you know, do you think what about building seven? The families want a new 9-11 investigation? Should there be one?
[45:41.900 --> 45:45.900]  He said, yeah, it sounds good to me. So that's on video.
[45:45.900 --> 45:54.900]  But shift gears into what you think of what happened with David from and let's go ahead and bring Stuart Howell. Then we'll get into the big news. Gary Hart, go ahead.
[45:54.900 --> 46:01.900]  I mean, I'm very happy Stuart had a camera out there because if he didn't have a camera out there, they would have said he assaulted him. He beat that guy up.
[46:01.900 --> 46:07.900]  And it's just amazing to see what these guys are really about. These guys will slap your camera. These guys will assault you.
[46:07.900 --> 46:17.900]  And it's just crazy what's really going on. And I'm so proud of my family out there and we are Changela. I'm so proud of all the chapters out there doing the great work that they're doing.
[46:17.900 --> 46:24.900]  I commend them to the fullest amount. And it's just incredible seeing people rising up, standing up and doing the right thing.
[46:24.900 --> 46:33.900]  I can't tell you how proud I am seeing other people be their own leaders, not looking up to anybody and just going out there with their camera, confronting these criminals.
[46:33.900 --> 46:43.900]  These criminals shouldn't have to go out their houses without being confronted. We have to be there everywhere, every city, every town, every city town hall meeting that there is.
[46:43.900 --> 46:49.900]  We should be out there with cameras. These people should not be going anywhere without being confronted on their crimes. I'm not 11.
[46:49.900 --> 46:58.900]  And that's what it's about. And that's what I love about everybody being out there. And I hope and I play people get inspired, people get out there, people do the right thing.
[46:58.900 --> 47:10.900]  Listen, this is not just words. You have everyone. Form your own groups. Call it the Kiborels. I don't care. We are change, info warriors, truth action, 9-11 truth, whatever.
[47:10.900 --> 47:18.900]  Just get out there and start confronting them everywhere so their illusions shatters. Everybody hates the government. The majority don't trust the government.
[47:18.900 --> 47:27.900]  90 plus percent don't want open borders, all this. We've got to go out and let the public know that they're not alone. Just like with what happened with Chalcescu. Go ahead.
[47:27.900 --> 47:34.900]  Just like I said last week on your show, the more they attack us, the more they set us up, the more we're going to fight back and that's what we're doing.
[47:34.900 --> 47:42.900]  We are change UK and we are change LA. And all over the country, people are stepping up their efforts because we're on their attack right now.
[47:42.900 --> 47:49.900]  And nothing is going to stop us. We're doubling our efforts. Literally, I dropped everything I was doing here in New York City after the whole Gary incident.
[47:49.900 --> 47:58.900]  And I dedicated myself to confiring people. And you still haven't seen half of it. The more they attack us, the more the scum attack us, the more we're going to fight back.
[47:58.900 --> 48:00.900]  The more we're going to confront these criminals everywhere they go.
[48:00.900 --> 48:04.900]  I hear you. Let's go to Stuart Howe. Stuart, comments on what Luke's saying.
[48:04.900 --> 48:09.900]  Man, I'm right there with all of it, Alex. We've got a lot of solidarity out here and everywhere.
[48:09.900 --> 48:22.900]  Luke came out here and we got together in San Diego with Cosmos of truth action. And we've got a big West Coast convergence coming up this Saturday, May 10th with the lead in on the 9th and going into the 11th in San Francisco.
[48:22.900 --> 48:29.900]  It's going to be the Federal Building and Courthouse and the Golden Gate Park coming up. So truth action is a great place to go.
[48:29.900 --> 48:39.900]  That's how I got into this. I was following length and went to truth action and got to my first street action and I was forced to wear a Luke.
[48:39.900 --> 48:48.900]  This is the stuff that really gets my juices flowing and seeing all of us in solidarity backing each other up and trying to carry our part of the torch.
[48:48.900 --> 48:56.900]  Absolutely. And you don't learn about film in film school. You don't learn about political science. I'm telling all the young people out there in these fake political science classes,
[48:56.900 --> 49:05.900]  you learn how to believe their false paradigms, their false maps, their false downloads they give you of literally simulations, their constructs.
[49:05.900 --> 49:15.900]  The real world is all around you. The enemy is chicken-necked cowards. Engage them. Stop letting them control our destiny. Stop letting them be history's actors.
[49:15.900 --> 49:23.900]  We are history's actors, Carl Rove. You sniveling murderer. You coward. You murderer. Go ahead, Jeff.
[49:23.900 --> 49:31.900]  We're the ones making history right now by doing everything we're doing right now. And the funny thing is, the same day I confronted Jimmy Carter,
[49:31.900 --> 49:38.900]  I was in class actually talking about Operation Ajax to my political professor. And that's what I like about going to school about,
[49:38.900 --> 49:42.900]  is I could educate all the professors. I could educate all the young kids that I could learn how to teach them.
[49:42.900 --> 49:47.900]  So waste of time. It's a way. Luke, listen, you already know more than those people.
[49:47.900 --> 49:54.900]  I kind of did educate the professor. That'd be like me going to UT film school, learn how to get stuff out to people.
[49:54.900 --> 50:01.900]  Yeah, I pretty much teach myself everything. And it's just very interesting to see how the whole spin doctrine works at college,
[50:01.900 --> 50:05.900]  because they don't tell you the truth. I had a professor tell me the Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[50:05.900 --> 50:10.900]  I got kicked out of my class last semester for arguing with the professor about the Gulf of Tonkin.
[50:10.900 --> 50:15.900]  That's how ridiculous it is in these colleges. And it really is ridiculous.
[50:15.900 --> 50:19.900]  Well, again, there are some good professors, some good departments here and there.
[50:19.900 --> 50:25.900]  There's a lot you really do learn in school because it's an atmosphere for it. But more and more, it's just a fake football team
[50:25.900 --> 50:33.900]  and a big money laundering operation. I mean, UT, a fraction of it is the classes, the school, the kids.
[50:33.900 --> 50:40.900]  It's a brainwashing chemical bioweapon laboratory, military industrial complex, money laundering operation.
[50:40.900 --> 50:45.900]  And they give you some stupid vivo and some scumbag cacaoardly football team.
[50:45.900 --> 50:49.900]  Makes me sick while we're all under scientific bioweapon attack.
[50:49.900 --> 51:11.900]  Meanwhile, we're worshiping some stupid cow. They're right back.

[52:52.900 --> 52:56.900]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[52:56.900 --> 53:01.900]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[53:01.900 --> 53:06.900]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[53:06.900 --> 53:12.900]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete fuel system treatment
[53:12.900 --> 53:17.900]  cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage and only one tank full.
[53:17.900 --> 53:22.900]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[53:22.900 --> 53:26.900]  Let's face it. With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[53:26.900 --> 53:34.900]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free.
[53:34.900 --> 53:43.900]  Call 8888 use SFR 1. That number again is 8888 use SFR 1 or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[53:43.900 --> 54:07.900]  That's oilcompanysecret.com. Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back, and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[54:07.900 --> 54:29.900]  Pentagon Run News Corp. You could call it cyanide to the free republic, the fake conservatives, the camouflage enemy attack,
[54:29.900 --> 54:39.900]  all their holdings out there attacking, Sunday Times of London, Wall Street Journal now completely owned by Murdoch.
[54:39.900 --> 54:44.900]  He's horning it out now. Totally discredited. Everybody should stop their subscription and let them know why.
[54:44.900 --> 54:52.900]  Wall Street Journal, total, total joke now. Lying and because the police report says that Gary actually bumped into somebody and hurt him.
[54:52.900 --> 54:59.900]  That's why they're charging him with class three assault. They don't care. They say he savagely beat and beat and beat a woman in a wheelchair.
[54:59.900 --> 55:05.900]  Not in the police report, but they don't care. It doesn't matter that the police report itself saying he actually hurt somebody's life.
[55:05.900 --> 55:13.900]  They attacked him and they need to raise money and we are changed, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:13.900 --> 55:22.900]  They need to raise money and we are changed. I'm always trying to send Luke a little bit of money for himself to live on. He never wants it.
[55:22.900 --> 55:31.900]  So I tell you, that's not what this is about. It's about them being able to have decent lawyers, and it's about also being able to sue for defamation.
[55:31.900 --> 55:42.900]  This is a serious civil rights violation where they set it up with the police, where they lie, that liar needs to be put on the stand with her father.
[55:42.900 --> 55:47.900]  And we need to start the suit against them so they know it's serious. Michelle Malkin needs to be sued. Sean Hannity needs to be sued.
[55:47.900 --> 55:51.900]  News Corp needs to be sued.
[55:51.900 --> 55:58.900]  I know we got lawyers listening in New York. Just file it. Just start it. Just start the discovery. They will crap their pants. Excuse my French.
[55:58.900 --> 56:01.900]  And they will roll over and admit they're a pack of liars.
[56:01.900 --> 56:12.900]  You start suing that Neocon and his daughter, they'll roll over real fast. All you got to do is give fight with these people.
[56:12.900 --> 56:21.900]  So instead of sending them money, I want lawyers to call Luke right now. I want to start the suits and I want money to defend Gary here on his class three.
[56:21.900 --> 56:28.900]  He just never play bargain. Go into that jury trial, drag that liar up, bring your witnesses up and pitch him. We're going to do this.
[56:28.900 --> 56:34.900]  Send them money now. WeAreChanged.org has got a paypal.
[56:34.900 --> 56:45.900]  And since they put it up last Friday, it's gotten a couple hundred bucks and the loose change, screw loose change operation and others make sniveling jokes about it from their Pentagon operation.
[56:45.900 --> 56:56.900]  We need to see that surge by tens of thousands of dollars. We raised something like 15 grand for Celica Stillo that went into his paypal and that he bought his books, which will help him with the way he's being set up.
[56:56.900 --> 57:02.900]  I didn't touch the money. I don't do like other operations. The other talk show hosts send me money and I'll give it to the person to help them.
[57:02.900 --> 57:16.900]  Don't send it to me. Send it to WeAreChanged. Send it to Luke Radowski. It will be used to defend him and just go to trial and just bring them in there.
[57:16.900 --> 57:38.900]  They'll probably try to drop it. We're going to show everybody how you're liars, Fox, how you're scum, America hating, lying, filth, trash of earth, bloodsucking, filth, liars, liars from the beginning.
[57:38.900 --> 57:42.900]  Luke, folks need to give you some donations. How are you going to use those donations?
[57:42.900 --> 57:51.900]  We're going to make this a huge deal. We're meeting with lawyers today. They're going to charge us a lot of money just to get Gary off his criminal charges, just to counter sue.
[57:51.900 --> 58:01.900]  No, no, no, no, no, no. You need to get political lawyers. If you don't like the sound of these guys, you need to only give them a retainer up front.
[58:01.900 --> 58:07.900]  And the minute they don't do what you tell them, you walk out of there. Stay there. Stay there. Where did you find these people?
[58:07.900 --> 58:19.900]  Luke. These people contacted us. But they want a bunch of money. Yeah, some of them do, yes. No, uh-uh. That's a load of bull.
[58:19.900 --> 58:24.900]  Look, I know we got somebody on the West Coast. They'll travel there from New York, donate the time, do what he knows what they're doing.
[58:24.900 --> 58:32.900]  I want to see credentials. I want to see that they win cases being contacted by somebody who wants the money. We're not putting up with that.
[58:32.900 --> 58:42.900]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:42.900 --> 58:47.900]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[58:47.900 --> 58:52.900]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:52.900 --> 58:57.900]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[58:57.900 --> 59:08.900]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:11.900 --> 59:20.900]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[59:20.900 --> 59:23.900]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:23.900 --> 59:28.900]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their after easy.
[59:28.900 --> 59:37.900]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[59:37.900 --> 59:53.900]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[1:00:25.900 --> 1:00:30.900]  Guys, I get real mad. I've asked good lawyers.
[1:00:30.900 --> 1:00:41.900]  To contact you guys, Class C is very easy to deal with. They will try to drop it as soon as they know you're going to fight it. You need to subpoena those tapes.
[1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:51.900]  You don't want to get off. You want to make this a showcase of their fraud. You want to drag these liars in.
[1:00:51.900 --> 1:01:01.900]  And at the same time, you want to go ahead and file for defamation because, regardless, the police say that he accidentally hurt somebody. They're saying he's savagely wailed and beat.
[1:01:01.900 --> 1:01:06.900]  There's calls for his death, calls for his murder on these websites.
[1:01:06.900 --> 1:01:13.900]  And again, Michelle Malick and all of you can be, I may just dig the money. I'm just giving it to you.
[1:01:13.900 --> 1:01:21.900]  I mean, she needs to be dragged into court. She needs to be in interrogatories. She needs to get to enjoy being deposed.
[1:01:21.900 --> 1:01:30.900]  Her lies need to be brought to justice. She wants to write books about how we all need to be put in camps. I've had enough of it.
[1:01:30.900 --> 1:01:35.900]  Fox News and that pack of criminals.
[1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:43.900]  And I say pack of criminals. It's illegal when they take money for fake newscast. It's illegal when they've got Pentagon propaganda on their channels in back room deals.
[1:01:43.900 --> 1:01:48.900]  All the Congress has said it's illegal.
[1:01:48.900 --> 1:01:55.900]  All right, let's go back to Luke. Luke said to me, Randy and Raving, I should have asked you in the break. So how many different lawyers have contacted you?
[1:01:55.900 --> 1:02:05.900]  We're in talks with five lawyers. Some of them are good. Some of them want some money. But we're going to make this a huge deal no matter what.
[1:02:05.900 --> 1:02:13.900]  And we're definitely looking to counter sue the New York Post, Kennedy, Michelle Malkin. Everybody that's slandered and then libeled and is trying to destroy our name will be sued for their actions.
[1:02:13.900 --> 1:02:18.900]  I mean, listen, you've got to be sued when you're saying you attacked a woman in a wheelchair viciously. Go ahead.
[1:02:18.900 --> 1:02:28.900]  It's ridiculous because it's accidental assault, assault three. That's what it is. Look at the official police report. That's what the New York Post should have done.
[1:02:28.900 --> 1:02:34.900]  Just looked at the police report and seen exactly what happened, seen exactly the accusations and scary.
[1:02:34.900 --> 1:02:40.900]  And then the next day, the father's going to come out and talk to the New York Post and say we assaulted his daughter and then his daughter's on Hannity.
[1:02:40.900 --> 1:02:48.900]  And then, and then Michelle Malkin's talking about it. And then the Wall Street Journal's libels and slanders our name. This is disgusting. And we will not stand for this.
[1:02:48.900 --> 1:02:50.900]  And we will rise up all together.
[1:02:50.900 --> 1:02:58.900]  To hear that, you're getting an example. You're getting sued. Guaranteed we're suing some of these people. You understand me?
[1:02:58.900 --> 1:03:07.900]  Hey, go ahead and laugh over at the Free Republic. Go ahead and laugh all over. You're going to find out. You're going to find out. Okay.
[1:03:07.900 --> 1:03:15.900]  I want money swelling their coffers. And I'm going to give you money if I have to, Luke.
[1:03:15.900 --> 1:03:23.900]  We're not backing down. That's it. I'm donating 10,000. That's it. 10,000. But I need to be able to direct a little bit of this.
[1:03:23.900 --> 1:03:27.900]  Of course. I don't want to just hand it to some little punk New York lawyer.
[1:03:27.900 --> 1:03:33.900]  Of course. I mean, thank you. I can't thank you enough for that. I mean, we're not going to back down.
[1:03:33.900 --> 1:03:39.900]  But here's the deal. We need people to start because I haven't even done this yet. Screenshotting all their sites, saving all of it.
[1:03:39.900 --> 1:03:48.900]  The civil rights violation of calling for hiring, hit teams, all of it. Screenshot it all. Grab it all now and have my office grab it right now.
[1:03:48.900 --> 1:03:52.900]  I mean, let's show these people what they've done.
[1:03:52.900 --> 1:03:59.900]  Exactly. And we're not going to back down. These people want to attack us. We're going to double our efforts. We confronted so many more people afterwards.
[1:03:59.900 --> 1:04:04.900]  We're going to sue them. We're going to put them into court. And we're going to make this an example of how they're trying to set us up.
[1:04:04.900 --> 1:04:11.900]  Provocators attack us and destroy our name and destroy our message of getting justice for all those affected by not a lemon.
[1:04:11.900 --> 1:04:13.900]  And nothing is going to stop us right now.
[1:04:13.900 --> 1:04:27.900]  This is what defamation suits are all about. They concerted effort by a media empire and their allied cronies to lie and say that someone viciously premeditatedly attacked a little girl in a wheelchair.
[1:04:27.900 --> 1:04:33.900]  Sick and it's disgusting. And we're not going to back down no matter what the time is now.
[1:04:33.900 --> 1:04:38.900]  We're going to make this a prime example of how they cannot mess with us. And we're going to put them right into court.
[1:04:38.900 --> 1:04:44.900]  We're going to make an example out of this case about how they're trying to provocateur stage attacks on us. And we're going to win.
[1:04:44.900 --> 1:04:46.900]  I mean, we have everything.
[1:04:46.900 --> 1:04:50.900]  I'll say this. All of them have 24 hours to retract.
[1:04:50.900 --> 1:05:03.900]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloading film in Internet history comes the long awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:10.900]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[1:05:10.900 --> 1:05:14.900]  And the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[1:05:14.900 --> 1:05:25.900]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases, to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[1:06:49.900 --> 1:06:57.900]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[1:06:57.900 --> 1:07:06.900]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed. It's called Night Skin, and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels, and without a facelift.

[1:08:05.900 --> 1:08:18.900]  The strategy here is to sue the neocon sub-minions first. Also, file suit on Fox, but the real attack is against their minions.
[1:08:18.900 --> 1:08:28.900]  They have less funds. They even exaggerated more on what Fox News did and then had their minions call for violent attacks, and that's how you do it.
[1:08:28.900 --> 1:08:37.900]  You hit a whole bunch of them, you will, and none of you are going to beat the ride. You all will lose. We will win. Freedom will win.
[1:08:37.900 --> 1:08:48.900]  That's it. I want money to pour into VR change, and we need to have Gary file. Probably, I would bundle two different groups into two different suits.
[1:08:48.900 --> 1:08:57.900]  It costs twice as much, but again, firing more torpedoes at the enemy will only freak them out that much worse and then make them spend money to defend themselves.
[1:08:57.900 --> 1:09:08.900]  You don't have a prayer. Everybody knows you're a pack of liars, Fox, and Fox cesspool holdings, and Gary didn't sit there whaling, beating savagely on the girl.
[1:09:08.900 --> 1:09:16.900]  In the fake police report, because the cops didn't want to go to jail for false reports, they know he drove the wheelchair into Gary.
[1:09:16.900 --> 1:09:28.900]  They know that that's the best they can do is claim that by him assaulting Gary, that they can try to twist it.
[1:09:28.900 --> 1:09:39.900]  But you're cooked right there. Their own report doesn't say that he purposely hit her. See, that's a lie too.
[1:09:39.900 --> 1:09:53.900]  And so you have been shown yet again to be fraudulent liars, a pack of deceptive liars.
[1:09:53.900 --> 1:10:03.900]  And Gary, for the rest of his life, his name is going to be ruined already as people calling for violence, calling for his death, death threats.
[1:10:03.900 --> 1:10:13.900]  I mean, think about Gary Tallis, German Gary Tallis, nicknamed Gary. Think about German. His whole life he's known now as some type of demon who just runs up and starts...
[1:10:13.900 --> 1:10:18.900]  Look at their official story. He just runs up out of nowhere and starts beating a girl in a wheelchair.
[1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:25.900]  But it's Fox's MO. It's neocon MO. They were throwing babies out of incubators. They were nerve-gassing a dog.
[1:10:25.900 --> 1:10:35.900]  They had WMDs hidden under a rose bush. They had uranium from Niger. They had aluminum tubes. They're going to hit us with nukes in 45 minutes.
[1:10:35.900 --> 1:10:43.900]  Shadam Hussein is electromagnetic bombs that can destroy the earth.
[1:10:43.900 --> 1:10:54.900]  We need to taze the 9-11 truthers. We need to beat them to a pulp. We need to arrest them in MSNBC. We need to send them to secret camps and kill them, kill them!
[1:10:54.900 --> 1:10:57.900]  Torture them!
[1:10:57.900 --> 1:11:13.900]  I mean, these cartoon characters, these pimps, these little lying scumbags in suits on TV with info babes, with all these idiots watching, believing you're bull.
[1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:25.900]  Sean Hannity with that stage phone call. Oh, we've got a call. Hello, young lady. How can I help you? I'm the girl they attacked. Oh, I'm so lucky I answered the phone. It was you. What did they do? They beat me.
[1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:33.900]  They beat me when my daddy was big and mean. The vicious creature attacked me.
[1:11:33.900 --> 1:11:39.900]  Disgusting.
[1:11:39.900 --> 1:11:51.900]  And if we wouldn't have got David Frum on tape, the neocon attack, and we are changed three times, coming up slapping him, slapping the camera, poking him with a bottle, it'd be all over the news.
[1:11:51.900 --> 1:12:01.900]  David Frum attacked by the vicious savage. Steward Howe pounded him in the face, breaking his nose, karate chopping him in the throat.
[1:12:01.900 --> 1:12:14.900]  Steward Howe jumped over the table and began biting him and savagely kneeing him, viciously screaming cuss words. But we got the video. He tried three times to knock it out of his hand, hitting it hard, wham, wham.
[1:12:14.900 --> 1:12:22.900]  And if he'd have been able to get that camera, oh, it'd all been over. But you weren't able to, were you?
[1:12:22.900 --> 1:12:26.900]  In fact, he says, I'm here to give you a message and starts cussing.
[1:12:26.900 --> 1:12:39.900]  Jumps over the table and attacks. I'm here to give you a message from Christopher Hitchens. Jumps over the table and attacks.
[1:12:39.900 --> 1:12:44.900]  Alright, in closing, anything else, Steward Howe? I appreciate all your time.
[1:12:44.900 --> 1:12:50.900]  Yeah, I appreciate your efforts too. And Luke, amazing stuff back there, bro. And Alex, thank you for rallying support.
[1:12:50.900 --> 1:12:59.900]  You know, we're out here. Bruno has a Fox lawsuit against Tim. We've been to court twice. We're spread thin. I was shot that stuff on a borrowed camera.
[1:12:59.900 --> 1:13:14.900]  And so, you know, you're supporting us is so appreciated. I mean, we really, really respected in my all your efforts and all the change people, Luke and everybody, you know, we're trying to do what we can with the limited resources that we've all got.
[1:13:14.900 --> 1:13:17.900]  Bruno is looking for legal representation.
[1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:20.900]  Yeah, let's be clear. Tell folks what happened with Bruno.
[1:13:20.900 --> 1:13:34.900]  Yeah, Bruno, our group, we are changing LA was at Fox and they were doing, you know, outreach and, you know, protest, real peaceful on the sidewalk and security came up and accosted him.
[1:13:34.900 --> 1:13:39.900]  And then of course they had him arrested and accused Bruno of assault and interfering with their operations.
[1:13:39.900 --> 1:13:44.900]  Now, a lot of that's on video, isn't it? That happened months ago.
[1:13:44.900 --> 1:13:56.900]  Yeah. Yeah, parts of it are on video, but you know, it's they're still proceeding. They were forced to drop the, the actual assault charges against Bruno, but they're proceeding with other other aspects of the case.
[1:13:56.900 --> 1:13:58.900]  And so we're criminal.
[1:13:58.900 --> 1:14:00.900]  Well, it's not a lawsuit. It's criminal, right?
[1:14:00.900 --> 1:14:03.900]  I believe it is. Yeah, Bruno has, you know, all of it.
[1:14:03.900 --> 1:14:07.900]  But I mean, here's the deal here. Notice it's always Fox, one of their key operations.
[1:14:07.900 --> 1:14:14.900]  And that's why a decent Sony camera, DV cam is only like 300 bucks.
[1:14:14.900 --> 1:14:18.900]  So yeah, somebody needs to give, we are changing a thousand, seeing about three of these cameras.
[1:14:18.900 --> 1:14:26.900]  You can look, you were alone with from, and he wasn't able to get your camera though he tried. Listen, you can't go out alone.
[1:14:26.900 --> 1:14:33.900]  And I've always told looking everybody else have like three cameras, two up front and then one at a distance, like when they tried to set Luke up with a bomb.
[1:14:33.900 --> 1:14:38.900]  They had to back off the setup because they saw the other guy with a camera and he had to run off with a camera.
[1:14:38.900 --> 1:14:42.900]  They were going to set Luke up. They said, we're going to plant bombs on you. Your life's over.
[1:14:42.900 --> 1:14:46.900]  I mean, only that there was the other camera they called off their, their, their operation.
[1:14:46.900 --> 1:14:52.900]  You guys have to understand, sir, they'll plant guns on you. They'll, they'll do anything.
[1:14:52.900 --> 1:14:55.900]  They don't play games. Okay.
[1:14:55.900 --> 1:15:00.900]  No, I believe you. I just had to go with what I had and go into it with what I had.
[1:15:00.900 --> 1:15:08.900]  You know, I understand, I probably would have done the same thing too. It's just, I understand, you know, it's the thrill of the chase there with these enemies of freedom, but there's just such trash.
[1:15:08.900 --> 1:15:17.900]  In fact, it was funny, Alex. I got an email from the girl Laurel, great member of our meetup who loaned us the camera and she said, oh, now I can see why you need a new pro consumer camera.
[1:15:17.900 --> 1:15:23.900]  You know, this one, you know, may not last long getting hit by these neocons.
[1:15:23.900 --> 1:15:29.900]  Absolutely. We'll give folks the contact info then. Your, your site's up, isn't it?
[1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:49.900]  Yeah. Well, actually the org.org site is having problems right now, but we do have, we have a PayPal donation aspect on the, on the meetup group, which is 911-11.meetup.com at 359, which is the LA, you know, base.
[1:15:49.900 --> 1:16:03.900]  Chapter 359. Yeah. 9-11.meetup.com forward slash 359. Yeah. And you know, we're definitely, you know, appreciative of all support, you know, both with the legal thing and with our camera.
[1:16:03.900 --> 1:16:09.900]  LA needs to ramp up their operations. We commend you and we appreciate you, Stuart. Take care.
[1:16:09.900 --> 1:16:10.900]  Thank you.
[1:16:10.900 --> 1:16:16.900]  Okay, Luke, I got a bunch of news I'm going to cover here. I think you're going to get donations from our great audience out there today.
[1:16:16.900 --> 1:16:26.900]  You know, I'm very busy. I'm not saying who I'm important. I'm saying I, I, I'm so busy I was up here working until again, midnight last night.
[1:16:26.900 --> 1:16:35.900]  I don't have time to oversee your lawyers. I don't have time to deal with all this, but I really can't donate a bunch of money myself.
[1:16:35.900 --> 1:16:45.900]  That's critical to our operations unless I know. And I think it's shameful that is the millions of listeners we have, that we don't have serious lawyers.
[1:16:45.900 --> 1:16:50.900]  This is the type of thing Gary Spence might take. We got some contacts there, but he's so busy and retired now.
[1:16:50.900 --> 1:16:57.900]  We need to, you know, I know there's some champions of liberty out there who aren't just cynical and we could pay for your hotel or whatever.
[1:16:57.900 --> 1:17:03.900]  You know, you live in New Jersey or upstate New York or in New York. I mean, this is ridiculous. You need to call Luke.
[1:17:03.900 --> 1:17:10.900]  We need lawyers that are good at litigating for, for defamation. I mean, this is Fox stinking news.
[1:17:10.900 --> 1:17:19.900]  This is Rupert Murdoch, Sunday Times of London, though they were given the video, didn't want it and said that we are Change Ireland for no reason.
[1:17:19.900 --> 1:17:26.900]  A tax stole the bag and beat up the member of European Parliament went on video. He, he attacks them. It's clear video.
[1:17:26.900 --> 1:17:32.900]  They said, we don't care. We're going to put it in here that you attacked. I mean, there's no end of these people.
[1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:41.900]  Now they say that he, that Gary ran up and started savaging someone in a wheelchair and now they're using that all over the place against us.
[1:17:41.900 --> 1:17:50.900]  I mean, they're so used to bullying and getting away with everything and always having their stinking way. Michelle Malcolm, the fake conservatives over at Free Republic.
[1:17:50.900 --> 1:18:01.900]  All of them. Fox news. I've had it with you. I've had it with your lies. I've had it with your fraud. I've had it with your calls for violence by your stinking members.
[1:18:01.900 --> 1:18:04.900]  Luke, you got a couple of minutes. Go ahead and sew everyone.
[1:18:04.900 --> 1:18:11.900]  In closing, we are winning. That's all we are under attack. We are change Ireland is under attack. We are change LA is under attack.
[1:18:11.900 --> 1:18:17.900]  Every Saturday we go to ground zero. We are under attack. Every, every time we do a two squad, we are under attack.
[1:18:17.900 --> 1:18:25.900]  We are winning the infill war. That's why they are attacking us. And I just wanted to add Gary's name is being destroyed all over the place.
[1:18:25.900 --> 1:18:31.900]  He originally tried to go for a job and they turned his job job down because of everything that happened recently.
[1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:33.900]  We're also getting a bunch of death threats.
[1:18:33.900 --> 1:18:37.900]  And let me be clear. Let me, let me stop you. I'm going to hold you over and I'm going to try to shut up and let you talk.
[1:18:37.900 --> 1:18:48.900]  But you just brought up key points right there. The definition of libel slander defamation. Of course, slander is a verbal or above the air libel written.
[1:18:48.900 --> 1:18:58.900]  But defamation is the overarching term is knowing you're lying, manufacturing a line with the intent to cause harm that they all fits that.
[1:18:58.900 --> 1:19:02.900]  And now he needs a record needs to write it down.
[1:19:02.900 --> 1:19:10.900]  Needs to needs to create an affidavit signed by him and he was turned down and where that is massive damages right there.
[1:19:10.900 --> 1:19:13.900]  He needs to call that person back and say, where did you hear it?
[1:19:13.900 --> 1:19:18.900]  Because of whether the person likes it or not, we're going to subpoena him or her.
[1:19:18.900 --> 1:19:23.900]  And the death threats are all key. I can get you the money to listen to the money loop, but you got to quit school.
[1:19:23.900 --> 1:19:26.900]  You can't sit here and play war part time.
[1:19:26.900 --> 1:19:33.900]  Okay, if you really want to go after these enemies and make them pay for their defamation, it's a full time job to sue these people.
[1:19:33.900 --> 1:19:40.900]  It isn't enough to throw money at lawyers. You've got to craft the case, prepare it and then ram it straight down their dirty throats.
[1:19:40.900 --> 1:19:46.900]  We'll be right back, Lucrodowski, we are change.org. That's the card. Let's give them money right now.
[1:19:50.900 --> 1:19:54.900]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:19:54.900 --> 1:19:59.900]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:19:59.900 --> 1:20:04.900]  It's known as the Builderberg Group. Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:04.900 --> 1:20:18.900]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:18.900 --> 1:20:23.900]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:23.900 --> 1:20:27.900]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:27.900 --> 1:20:30.900]  Builderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:30.900 --> 1:20:34.900]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[1:20:34.900 --> 1:20:36.900]  That's their affidavit.
[1:20:49.900 --> 1:20:57.900]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond. You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened at the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.

[1:21:48.900 --> 1:21:54.900]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:21:54.900 --> 1:21:56.900]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:21:56.900 --> 1:21:59.900]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:21:59.900 --> 1:22:05.900]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:22:05.900 --> 1:22:09.900]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:24:13.900 --> 1:24:16.900]  Thank you for all the people listening. Thank you for all the people taking action.
[1:24:16.900 --> 1:24:20.900]  Thank you for all the people donating. We usually don't ask for donations, but we really do need it now.
[1:24:20.900 --> 1:24:25.900]  We're going to make this a huge case. We're going to do everything we can to make an example out of this.
[1:24:25.900 --> 1:24:31.900]  And again, get out there, confront people wherever they go. They should not go anywhere without being confronted.
[1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:36.900]  And we're not going to stop that death threats are not going to stop us. The provocateur actions are not going to stop us.
[1:24:36.900 --> 1:24:42.900]  And we're going to keep doing what we're doing, and we will never stop until we get ultimate justice for not allowing it.
[1:24:42.900 --> 1:24:49.900]  Well, a lot of the well-meaning cowards on the Neocon websites, they really think we beat up a girl in a wheelchair.
[1:24:49.900 --> 1:24:56.900]  They really believe that their wicked mother, Fox News, that they suckle from.
[1:24:56.900 --> 1:25:02.900]  But it's cyanide. I mean, they're just so pathetic. They think open borders and gun control is conservative.
[1:25:02.900 --> 1:25:07.900]  It's just so sick. It's so sick.
[1:25:07.900 --> 1:25:14.900]  It is sick. And it's a very sad day to see what's going on right now and seeing people actually believe the propaganda that Fox News,
[1:25:14.900 --> 1:25:19.900]  that the New York Post puts out there, but we're out there. We're going to counter sue. We're going to win this court case.
[1:25:19.900 --> 1:25:22.900]  We're not going to back down. We're going to make an example out of this about how the mainstream...
[1:25:22.900 --> 1:25:28.900]  Well, you're not counter-suing. You're not being sued, Luke.
[1:25:28.900 --> 1:25:31.900]  I mean, just get in terms straight out there.
[1:25:31.900 --> 1:25:37.900]  The police, because it was embarrassing, a guy with a wheelchair uses it as a weapon and attacks according to Gary,
[1:25:37.900 --> 1:25:40.900]  and I believe him and I believe the eyewitnesses and I believe their MO.
[1:25:40.900 --> 1:25:47.900]  And then the police say it's accidental assault on Gary because they were agreeing with the Neocon angle.
[1:25:47.900 --> 1:25:52.900]  But they don't want to get caught with a frame up, so they did the watered-down version.
[1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:58.900]  And the fact is the New York Post has caught red-handed taking that police report and lying and saying it was him wailing on her.
[1:25:58.900 --> 1:26:00.900]  And so you've got them right there.
[1:26:00.900 --> 1:26:07.900]  And they did this in a premeditated fashion, but then the extrapolation and the way they expanded it on the other sites,
[1:26:07.900 --> 1:26:13.900]  those are the weakest link that need to be attacked because news corps is being sued every day and just keeps it quiet.
[1:26:13.900 --> 1:26:18.900]  You need to go after the other minions. That's where the death threats got generated from.
[1:26:18.900 --> 1:26:22.900]  We're going to go after every angle. We're going to go after everybody, slandering and libeling our name.
[1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:25.900]  And we're going to stand up, and enough is enough.
[1:26:25.900 --> 1:26:29.900]  Enough is enough, and we're going to do the right thing, and we're going to make a huge example out of this.
[1:26:29.900 --> 1:26:33.900]  That's right. You can name them all on the same lawsuit and then just subpoena them all.
[1:26:33.900 --> 1:26:39.900]  And just that process will probably cost about 15 grand, but they're going to have to spend money to fight it.
[1:26:39.900 --> 1:26:41.900]  And believe me, they're not going to like it.
[1:26:41.900 --> 1:26:46.900]  And then they're going to shoot their mouths off and act tough, and then it's going to become an ego thing,
[1:26:46.900 --> 1:26:51.900]  and I'm going to belly up with even more money because I want to see these chicken necks in court.
[1:26:51.900 --> 1:26:57.900]  They're going to be put to court, and this is going to be a huge example of libel and flander
[1:26:57.900 --> 1:27:00.900]  and them trying to destroy the name of this movement.
[1:27:00.900 --> 1:27:02.900]  And it's not going to work. It's going to backfire on them.
[1:27:02.900 --> 1:27:08.900]  Every attack they put on us is going to backfire on them because we have truth on our side and the truth will speak for itself.
[1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:12.900]  We've got Gilbert Griffin coming up later, and we're helping some phones up, too.
[1:27:12.900 --> 1:27:17.900]  I've got a bunch of news I haven't covered, but the huge news we haven't even gotten to, tell them about Gary Hart.
[1:27:17.900 --> 1:27:21.900]  Gary Hart wrote a letter to Iran basically saying, our government stages attacks.
[1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:23.900]  You better do what we say or we'll do it.
[1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:26.900]  You guys confronted him, and he admitted it, and that tape's coming out soon.
[1:27:26.900 --> 1:27:29.900]  In fact, I need that now. I'm told that was mailed to me yesterday.
[1:27:29.900 --> 1:27:32.900]  I want to put that in the film about 9-11 Truth. It's almost done.
[1:27:32.900 --> 1:27:34.900]  But Luke, tell us about that.
[1:27:34.900 --> 1:27:41.900]  We confronted Gary Hart on his letter. He tried to deny his letter at first until Brian Kenney, one of our members here,
[1:27:41.900 --> 1:27:46.900]  took out the letter from his pocket and read it to him, so he couldn't deny the letter.
[1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:52.900]  We read it to him, and then Gary Hart admitted and said, well, I'm just trying to warn the Iranian government,
[1:27:52.900 --> 1:27:56.900]  the Iranian National Guard, that Bush wants to bomb Iran.
[1:27:56.900 --> 1:27:59.900]  And this is his own words, and he said, quote,
[1:27:59.900 --> 1:28:06.900]  he may use a USS Gulf Tonkin, a USS Maine, to get a war with Iran.
[1:28:06.900 --> 1:28:08.900]  That's what I wanted to say in my letter.
[1:28:08.900 --> 1:28:13.900]  But again, that was a letter to their government, which they published,
[1:28:13.900 --> 1:28:18.900]  which he doesn't want the domestic idiot population to know about.
[1:28:18.900 --> 1:28:22.900]  He told us it was a public letter that he put on a blog.
[1:28:22.900 --> 1:28:25.900]  That's what he told us about that letter.
[1:28:25.900 --> 1:28:31.900]  But the incredible thing is, last time he got confronted, he told you guys that he never called for a New World Order when we have him on video.
[1:28:31.900 --> 1:28:36.900]  Exactly. And then I confronted him. I read him that quote exactly, and the man just flipped out.
[1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:41.900]  He flipped out and then played semantics with his words, and he said, no, they try to say it.
[1:28:41.900 --> 1:28:43.900]  I said it nine times. I never said it nine times.
[1:28:43.900 --> 1:28:46.900]  And then we started asking him, so what is a New World Order?
[1:28:46.900 --> 1:28:50.900]  Can you please explain to us what is a New World Order and how would not 11 get a New World Order?
[1:28:50.900 --> 1:28:55.900]  And then he just got really mad and he was like, go ask George W. Bush what a New World Order is.
[1:28:55.900 --> 1:28:59.900]  Don't ask me. And then he took the next question and started poking fun at me.
[1:28:59.900 --> 1:29:02.900]  And he wouldn't answer the question about what a New World Order is.
[1:29:02.900 --> 1:29:06.900]  Well, it's so sick that they've co-opted all the well-meaning conservatives.
[1:29:06.900 --> 1:29:12.900]  I mean, under Clinton, the mainline conservatives at Free Republic and other places knew about the New World Order.
[1:29:12.900 --> 1:29:16.900]  They were fighting it. Now, since Bush says it doesn't exist, they just say it doesn't exist.
[1:29:16.900 --> 1:29:20.900]  And we're all evil traders because we make up NAU. None of it exists.
[1:29:20.900 --> 1:29:24.900]  We're the real conservatives, not you. It's so shameful.
[1:29:24.900 --> 1:29:29.900]  We need you to stop being enemies of the Republic and to stop going along with this whole agenda.
[1:29:29.900 --> 1:29:31.900]  Luke, when is that video going to be up?
[1:29:31.900 --> 1:29:33.900]  It should be up later today.
[1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:36.900]  I can't wait. Folks, you'll see an article about it at infowars.com.
[1:29:36.900 --> 1:29:38.900]  Thank you, Lou Bradoski.
[1:29:40.900 --> 1:29:44.900]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:44.900 --> 1:29:47.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:50.900 --> 1:29:53.900]  Hello. This is Tom with hempusa.org.
[1:29:53.900 --> 1:29:56.900]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months,
[1:29:56.900 --> 1:30:01.900]  and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[1:30:01.900 --> 1:30:07.900]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family,
[1:30:07.900 --> 1:30:09.900]  the time to act is now.
[1:30:09.900 --> 1:30:16.900]  At hempusa.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[1:30:16.900 --> 1:30:23.900]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[1:30:23.900 --> 1:30:26.900]  Beware, be smart, and be ready.
[1:30:26.900 --> 1:30:32.900]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org.
[1:30:32.900 --> 1:30:38.900]  Families need this high-quality natural food source for its low price and long-storage shelf life.
[1:30:38.900 --> 1:30:42.900]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[1:30:42.900 --> 1:30:49.900]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[1:30:49.900 --> 1:30:53.900]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water,
[1:30:53.900 --> 1:30:56.900]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[1:30:56.900 --> 1:30:59.900]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[1:30:59.900 --> 1:31:02.900]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate,
[1:31:02.900 --> 1:31:04.900]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[1:31:04.900 --> 1:31:08.900]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water,
[1:31:08.900 --> 1:31:12.900]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron,
[1:31:12.900 --> 1:31:16.900]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[1:31:16.900 --> 1:31:20.900]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons,
[1:31:20.900 --> 1:31:22.900]  or one year whichever comes first.
[1:31:22.900 --> 1:31:28.900]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[1:31:28.900 --> 1:31:29.900]  What about you?
[1:31:29.900 --> 1:31:35.900]  We are KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[1:31:40.900 --> 1:32:09.900]  That's 1-877-886-3653, or simply click on the banner at GCNLive.com to order online now.
[1:32:18.900 --> 1:32:21.900]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[1:32:21.900 --> 1:32:26.900]  From history we saw that when Church and State united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[1:32:26.900 --> 1:32:30.900]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[1:32:30.900 --> 1:32:33.900]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[1:32:33.900 --> 1:32:36.900]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[1:32:36.900 --> 1:32:38.900]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[1:32:38.900 --> 1:32:45.900]  These prophecies coming soon for free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says
[1:32:45.900 --> 1:33:08.900]  1-899-Linor City, Tennessee 377-71.
[1:33:08.900 --> 1:33:17.900]  Okay, in the next segment into the bottom of the next hour, we'll take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[1:33:17.900 --> 1:33:24.900]  Then we've got Gia Bergriffen in here from 130 Central to 3PM Central Standard Time in Studio.
[1:33:24.900 --> 1:33:31.900]  I've interviewed him many times over the telephone, but never in person, so I look forward to it.
[1:33:31.900 --> 1:33:34.900]  I get so busy defending other people, trying to help.
[1:33:34.900 --> 1:33:39.900]  Stella trying to help, we are changed, trying to help every other group that's out there fighting the New World Order.
[1:33:39.900 --> 1:33:42.900]  And I appreciate you, the listeners, coming to their aid time and time again.
[1:33:42.900 --> 1:33:45.900]  We couldn't do it without you.
[1:33:45.900 --> 1:33:49.900]  Helping the kids, families we have on, where CPS is kidnapped their children for no reason.
[1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:56.900]  I mean, there's so much we're trying to do here, and I just appreciate you, the audience, supporting us and supporting the sponsors and everything else.
[1:33:56.900 --> 1:33:58.900]  What are the sponsors of this show?
[1:33:58.900 --> 1:34:01.900]  Well, most importantly are PrismPlanet.tv.
[1:34:01.900 --> 1:34:11.900]  Not only is it a great value with all 18 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my Wheatley TV report, my in-studio interviews,
[1:34:11.900 --> 1:34:21.900]  archives going back four years and close to a month, thousands of pieces of media, scores of other films I've been authorized to post there for you,
[1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:30.900]  super high quality now, CDN delivery, so it comes to you super fast and super high quality, download, flash streaming, windows, quick time.
[1:34:30.900 --> 1:34:40.900]  Extra exclusives where you get like an hour and 40 minute extra for in-game that didn't come with the film on top of, you know, I mean, it's just amazing.
[1:34:40.900 --> 1:34:43.900]  Now we take the last hour every day.
[1:34:43.900 --> 1:34:47.900]  Today, when you have a Griffin, we'll take an hour and a half and we stream it live to you.
[1:34:47.900 --> 1:34:52.900]  Then we archive that file within two hours on PrismPlanet.tv.
[1:34:52.900 --> 1:34:58.900]  So when you get home, you can watch that fourth hour, which we always try to make extra special for you.
[1:34:58.900 --> 1:35:05.900]  We just started that a few weeks ago, a lot of affiliates are already picking up the radio show, but it's also a TV show.
[1:35:05.900 --> 1:35:08.900]  At PrismPlanet.tv.
[1:35:08.900 --> 1:35:14.900]  Again, that's PrismPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[1:35:14.900 --> 1:35:16.900]  And we're about to get a bigger, better office.
[1:35:16.900 --> 1:35:19.900]  We're going to try to develop more TV shows on the web.
[1:35:19.900 --> 1:35:24.900]  I'm even thinking about getting a satellite feed and doing more, but it takes capital to do that.
[1:35:24.900 --> 1:35:33.900]  And frankly, I like to be able to come in with the capital and help people sue Fox Television for absolutely slandering each and every one of us who believe in 9-11 Truth.
[1:35:33.900 --> 1:35:40.900]  That we're a bunch of people that attack people that have muscular dystrophy and wheelchairs.
[1:35:40.900 --> 1:35:42.900]  I mean, it's just unbelievable lies.
[1:35:42.900 --> 1:35:50.900]  So I need fuel in my Saturn rocket to get out of the atmosphere, fuel me, see us as an ICBM.
[1:35:50.900 --> 1:35:55.900]  We're fueled, folks, and you just keep loading us with fuel in air.
[1:35:55.900 --> 1:35:57.900]  And we're going to go in.
[1:35:57.900 --> 1:36:01.900]  We're going to pop our nose cone and hit them with Merv weapons.
[1:36:01.900 --> 1:36:03.900]  I mean, we are blowing holes in the enemy.
[1:36:03.900 --> 1:36:05.900]  This is the front line.
[1:36:05.900 --> 1:36:07.900]  We are just blasting through them.
[1:36:07.900 --> 1:36:12.900]  Ragtag teams out there, I try to energize and give attention and help people network together.
[1:36:12.900 --> 1:36:17.900]  I'm asking you to start your own VR change, your own info wars, truth action, whatever you want to call it.
[1:36:17.900 --> 1:36:19.900]  Just get out there and start confronting these criminals.
[1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:22.900]  The government does whatever it wants, whenever it wants, however it wants.
[1:36:22.900 --> 1:36:25.900]  And they know we're starting to get antsy about being slaves.
[1:36:25.900 --> 1:36:34.900]  So they're handing out machine guns to all the police, building FEMA camps, putting in Defense Department run camera systems, total control.
[1:36:34.900 --> 1:36:37.900]  We need your support, PrismPlanet.tv.
[1:36:37.900 --> 1:36:42.900]  And when you go and become a member of PrismPlanet.tv, burn copies of my TV shows.
[1:36:42.900 --> 1:36:52.900]  If a particular report you think is important on vaccines or government bio weapons or the fakeness of the environmental movement, I care about the environment, folks.
[1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:54.900]  People say, you're not for the environment.
[1:36:54.900 --> 1:36:55.900]  No, no, no.
[1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:57.900]  The modern environmental movement is a eugenics movement.
[1:36:57.900 --> 1:36:59.900]  And we've made films about that.
[1:36:59.900 --> 1:37:00.900]  We've done special reports on it.
[1:37:00.900 --> 1:37:10.900]  The point is, every subject you can imagine, every guess you can imagine, every angle you can imagine in multifaceted interviews, there might be 20 on 9-11 or 50 on 9-11 interviews.
[1:37:10.900 --> 1:37:13.900]  There's probably more than that, probably 200 on PrismPlanet.tv.
[1:37:13.900 --> 1:37:15.900]  There might be 20 shows on vaccines.
[1:37:15.900 --> 1:37:17.900]  I mean, it's just insane.
[1:37:17.900 --> 1:37:20.900]  You need to go through all those interviews and video interviews and kind of categorize them.
[1:37:20.900 --> 1:37:21.900]  That's a good idea.
[1:37:21.900 --> 1:37:23.900]  But we need money to have the staff to do that.
[1:37:23.900 --> 1:37:25.900]  It's a cash 22.
[1:37:25.900 --> 1:37:30.900]  So PrismPlanet.tv, if you used to have a membership and don't now, go back and get another one.
[1:37:30.900 --> 1:37:33.900]  Or if you've never got a PrismPlanet.tv membership, you're too busy to even use it.
[1:37:33.900 --> 1:37:35.900]  You just listen to the show on the radio.
[1:37:35.900 --> 1:37:37.900]  Just get one as a donation.
[1:37:37.900 --> 1:37:41.900]  Get one and then give the passcode, the username and passcode, to a couple of your neighbors.
[1:37:41.900 --> 1:37:42.900]  I don't care.
[1:37:42.900 --> 1:37:44.900]  Before, we only had a couple servers on it.
[1:37:44.900 --> 1:37:51.900]  And I didn't want you giving people your passcode because it would slow it down for everybody.
[1:37:51.900 --> 1:37:56.900]  But now I got CDN and a lot of headrooms, so share it with 10 people.
[1:37:56.900 --> 1:38:02.900]  In fact, guys, I want to set the window from three IP addresses to 10.
[1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:05.900]  I want to change that right now to 10 IP addresses.
[1:38:05.900 --> 1:38:10.900]  That's another way to attack the enemy, destroy the enemy, crush them.
[1:38:10.900 --> 1:38:14.900]  You think I'm joking around, folks?
[1:38:14.900 --> 1:38:18.900]  You think I'll get up here and I yell and scream and talk like this because it's an act?
[1:38:18.900 --> 1:38:20.900]  I am a wild man.
[1:38:20.900 --> 1:38:24.900]  I'm a maniac.
[1:38:24.900 --> 1:38:27.900]  I'm ashamed of the way I act, but at the same time, I'm not ashamed.
[1:38:27.900 --> 1:38:28.900]  I'm real.
[1:38:28.900 --> 1:38:29.900]  These are killers.
[1:38:29.900 --> 1:38:31.900]  Man, they're poisoning us.
[1:38:31.900 --> 1:38:34.900]  How do we calmly sit around and deal with them?
[1:38:34.900 --> 1:38:36.900]  How do we calmly put up with this anymore?
[1:38:36.900 --> 1:38:40.900]  I'm done saying we beat up a girl in a wheelchair.
[1:38:40.900 --> 1:38:45.900]  There's no end to these people.
[1:38:45.900 --> 1:38:46.900]  You're the ones attacking us.
[1:38:46.900 --> 1:38:47.900]  You're the ones destroying our country.
[1:38:47.900 --> 1:38:49.900]  You're the ones getting rid of our borders.
[1:38:49.900 --> 1:38:55.900]  You're the ones launching wars in our names and making us pay for it when the whole country is completely bankrupt.
[1:38:55.900 --> 1:39:00.900]  You're the ones building FEMA camps and writing books about how they're good and how we need to go in them.
[1:39:00.900 --> 1:39:04.900]  And saying to sinners, they need to go to secret camps and be tortured.
[1:39:04.900 --> 1:39:12.900]  They're calling for our death and I've had enough of it.
[1:39:12.900 --> 1:39:17.900]  Okay, I'm going to shut it down because I got a lot of news I want to cover.
[1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:19.900]  Oh, man.
[1:39:19.900 --> 1:39:22.900]  Oh, my God.
[1:39:22.900 --> 1:39:26.900]  Actually, I want to play a clip of a Len Horowitz film.
[1:39:26.900 --> 1:39:31.900]  I'll take a few calls because I got to play that before Griffin joins us.
[1:39:31.900 --> 1:39:35.900]  And I got all this news here in front of me.
[1:39:35.900 --> 1:39:39.900]  Oh, God.
[1:39:39.900 --> 1:39:41.900]  It's just so insane.
[1:39:41.900 --> 1:39:45.900]  All the things that are happening.
[1:39:45.900 --> 1:39:50.900]  All the things that are going on.
[1:39:50.900 --> 1:40:01.900]  It's normal to freak out over a media that's saying torture and secret arrest of people that disagree with the government is now good.
[1:40:01.900 --> 1:40:07.900]  They're not up there saying that in unison on all the major news channels because they want to kiss and make nice.
[1:40:07.900 --> 1:40:16.900]  You think those little cowardly, effeminate men at Fox and CNN, do you think they care one bit if I was to go to a camp and be tortured to death?
[1:40:16.900 --> 1:40:28.900]  They like it. They're petty, power-trip trash who do nothing but kiss each other's hind ends and grovel and shemper around and are into their penthouses and their sports cars.
[1:40:28.900 --> 1:40:30.900]  They are trash.
[1:40:30.900 --> 1:40:33.900]  They are enemies of you and your family.
[1:40:33.900 --> 1:40:36.900]  Mortal enemies.
[1:40:36.900 --> 1:40:39.900]  The globalists want their police state so they can...
[1:40:39.900 --> 1:40:49.900]  They're reporting you're going to be paying five, six, seven, eight mainstream news reporting you're going to be paying basically unlimited amounts for gas, unlimited amounts for food.
[1:40:49.900 --> 1:40:54.900]  It's all contrived. They're raping you. They hate you.
[1:40:54.900 --> 1:41:02.900]  Now police chiefs in major cities say, yeah, we wear black uniforms to intimidate you. Yeah, we're handing out machine guns to oppress the American people.
[1:41:02.900 --> 1:41:07.900]  Yeah, we're building camps. Yeah, we're getting ready for martial law in case the public doesn't like it.
[1:41:07.900 --> 1:41:10.900]  We're the bosses now.
[1:41:13.900 --> 1:41:22.900]  I'm already digressing. The point is I want you to make copies of all my films and get them out to everybody.
[1:41:22.900 --> 1:41:26.900]  I want you to make copies of Endgame and Terror Storm.
[1:41:26.900 --> 1:41:29.900]  I want you to get Loose Change Final Cut on DVD at infowars.com.
[1:41:29.900 --> 1:41:36.900]  I want you to get American Drug War so you can see how these bastards ship the drugs in and have the nerve to put your kids in prison if they get caught using.
[1:41:36.900 --> 1:41:38.900]  It's so sick.
[1:41:38.900 --> 1:41:41.900]  And Washington, you're fired.
[1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:43.900]  Just in. We are Change New York.
[1:41:43.900 --> 1:41:44.900]  Just confronted Newt Gennrich.
[1:41:44.900 --> 1:41:46.900]  Philly 9-11 Truth confronts Ted Turner.
[1:41:46.900 --> 1:41:47.900]  Video up.
[1:41:47.900 --> 1:41:48.900]  Transmit to the network.
[1:41:48.900 --> 1:41:50.900]  Let's get it up on infowars now.
[1:41:50.900 --> 1:41:52.900]  Stand by.
[1:41:52.900 --> 1:42:00.900]  We need to be flooded with funds, ladies and gentlemen, so we can try to defend and help these attack ships.
[1:42:00.900 --> 1:42:07.900]  That's basically what it is, and so that we can intensify our operations against the New World Order crime syndicate.
[1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:10.900]  And we need you to not wait for orders from headquarters.
[1:42:10.900 --> 1:42:11.900]  We need you to take action.
[1:42:11.900 --> 1:42:18.900]  So go to infowars.com and buy all the books and videos and DVDs and just know you throw more coal into our engine.
[1:42:18.900 --> 1:42:23.900]  So that we can get that engine going and get that train going even faster.
[1:42:23.900 --> 1:42:25.900]  And you bet it's a collision course.
[1:42:25.900 --> 1:42:26.900]  The enemy's got their train.
[1:42:26.900 --> 1:42:27.900]  They're throwing coal in it.
[1:42:27.900 --> 1:42:29.900]  The dead bodies of dead Iraqi children.
[1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:31.900]  The propaganda.
[1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:33.900]  Their pharmaceutical ad money.
[1:42:33.900 --> 1:42:35.900]  And they think we're going to blink.
[1:42:35.900 --> 1:42:37.900]  Hey, there's no track to get off.
[1:42:37.900 --> 1:42:39.900]  There's no stopping it now.
[1:42:39.900 --> 1:42:46.900]  The murdering terrorist that carried out the attacks will be brought to justice.
[1:42:46.900 --> 1:42:48.900]  You have to visualize that.
[1:42:48.900 --> 1:42:49.900]  Not because it's mumbo jumbo.
[1:42:49.900 --> 1:42:53.900]  By visualizing, you're able to do it in sports, in business and anything.
[1:42:53.900 --> 1:42:54.900]  We're going to bring them to justice.
[1:42:54.900 --> 1:42:56.900]  They're going to stand in the Nuremberg dock.
[1:42:56.900 --> 1:42:58.900]  It's all going to come out.
[1:42:58.900 --> 1:43:00.900]  You didn't just kill Kennedy.
[1:43:00.900 --> 1:43:04.900]  Yeah, you blew his head off and people said, well, that's him, not us.
[1:43:04.900 --> 1:43:10.900]  But the American people know in their gut, if you'll kill 3,000 of us, you'll kill 3 million of us.
[1:43:10.900 --> 1:43:12.900]  And they're now going, wait a minute.
[1:43:12.900 --> 1:43:16.900]  They'll kill 3,000 of us for no reason, even if we serve them and buy into the line.
[1:43:16.900 --> 1:43:18.900]  Hell, they probably are poisoning us.
[1:43:18.900 --> 1:43:21.900]  And then the people go find out they are poisoning you.
[1:43:21.900 --> 1:43:23.900]  I'm going to say it again, cops.
[1:43:23.900 --> 1:43:24.900]  You think I'm nuts?
[1:43:24.900 --> 1:43:26.900]  You bet I'm crazy.
[1:43:26.900 --> 1:43:33.900]  Those of you that think you're normal living in this system, you think it's normal to go from 1 in 33 with cancer to 1 in 3?
[1:43:33.900 --> 1:43:40.900]  You think it's normal to go from 1 in a couple thousand to have diabetes to now 1 in 4, 1 in 3, depending on the numbers you look at?
[1:43:40.900 --> 1:43:47.900]  You think it's normal to have all the rats dying in GMO tests and then they've certified for us to eat?
[1:43:47.900 --> 1:43:50.900]  You think human cow clones are normal?
[1:43:50.900 --> 1:43:52.900]  We're living in crazy land.
[1:43:52.900 --> 1:43:55.900]  And I, for one, am not going along with it anymore.
[1:43:55.900 --> 1:44:00.900]  Now, I'm going to tell you again, officers listening, FBI doesn't matter.
[1:44:00.900 --> 1:44:04.900]  You can go find out the government engineer at AIDS. It's declassified. It's public.
[1:44:04.900 --> 1:44:08.900]  You can go find out the engineer, a lot of other stuff.
[1:44:08.900 --> 1:44:20.900]  I got a tape of the discoverer of the polio vaccine admitting that it was scores over 40 deadly bio weapons viruses.
[1:44:20.900 --> 1:44:24.900]  You know what monkeys they used?
[1:44:24.900 --> 1:44:29.900]  You know why the U.S. and U.N. built their bio weapons labs in England and France in Africa?
[1:44:29.900 --> 1:44:34.900]  Because they could get away with whatever they wanted, not a free society, no radio, no TV locally.
[1:44:34.900 --> 1:44:38.900]  It's all declassified. They created Ebola, everything, all of it.
[1:44:38.900 --> 1:44:47.900]  And Dr. Pionka gives speeches and gets standing ovations when he says soon airborne will be released and 90% of us will die.
[1:44:47.900 --> 1:44:54.900]  And the entire auditorium stands for three minute long sustained standing ovations.
[1:44:54.900 --> 1:44:58.900]  It's a sick cult, isn't it? You imagine the power trips of all these scientists.
[1:44:58.900 --> 1:45:01.900]  Many of them have been let in on the plan.
[1:45:01.900 --> 1:45:10.900]  As soon as their police states in place, as soon as the police are trained for roadblocks and locking down cities, they're going to start releasing it.
[1:45:10.900 --> 1:45:15.900]  You understand? And I know you're not going to listen now, but when you die, police,
[1:45:15.900 --> 1:45:25.900]  when your children are dying, you can at least get on the radio and tell officers in the next town that didn't know that it was them that they did it.
[1:45:25.900 --> 1:45:29.900]  Will you do the right thing? Will it have a Hollywood ending?
[1:45:29.900 --> 1:45:35.900]  Like in Soylent Green, when he says it's made out of people, you got to tell them, Hatcher, soon they'll be breeding.
[1:45:35.900 --> 1:45:39.900]  It's like cattle, or it won't be like that will it.
[1:45:39.900 --> 1:45:46.900]  You'll probably just sit there and die with your children vomiting with sores all over them, with blood coming out of every orifice.
[1:45:46.900 --> 1:45:54.900]  You'll probably send a radio begging for the black helicopters to come save you.
[1:45:54.900 --> 1:45:59.900]  You will, won't you? Yes. Yes, that's what you're going to do, isn't it?
[1:45:59.900 --> 1:46:08.900]  You'll sit there just like the head of the police in the county around New Orleans when the feds told them you can't go get your mommy.
[1:46:08.900 --> 1:46:14.900]  He said, yes, sir, mommy dies, because that's who you are.
[1:46:14.900 --> 1:46:21.900]  You've lived a lie. You've lived cowardice so long that you're fully committed to all of it.
[1:46:21.900 --> 1:46:27.900]  And then when Reverend Jeremiah Wright comes out and tells the truth, you'll call him a traitor.
[1:46:27.900 --> 1:46:34.900]  But don't confuse that with Barack Obama. He just did that in local politics to get elected state senator.
[1:46:34.900 --> 1:46:41.900]  He doesn't believe any of that. He believes like the speech at the end of the shooter where he tells him,
[1:46:41.900 --> 1:46:48.900]  there's only the haves and the have nots, the winners and the loser. You might as well be on the side who's well paid.
[1:46:48.900 --> 1:46:53.900]  You guys on the side that's well paid only survive because you had a free society to feed off of,
[1:46:53.900 --> 1:46:59.900]  and now you've run that down the tubes and the boys at the top of the pyramid are closing it all down now.
[1:46:59.900 --> 1:47:07.900]  The joy rides over for everybody. And I'm mad about it because I want to go wax my car.
[1:47:07.900 --> 1:47:15.900]  I want to go on vacations. I want to work out two hours a day.
[1:47:15.900 --> 1:47:22.900]  But I can't do any of that because I know the whole society's run by a criminally insane mob of psychopathic,
[1:47:22.900 --> 1:47:29.900]  genius eugenicists who openly in every one of their statements say they plan to kill us. I played the top eugenicists
[1:47:29.900 --> 1:47:33.900]  slash top robotics experts in the world that head up entire university divisions,
[1:47:33.900 --> 1:47:41.900]  saying that the cyborg class is going to kill the rest of the Terrans as soon as they're in control.
[1:47:41.900 --> 1:47:45.900]  And that's what the owner of Sun Microsystems told you. He said,
[1:47:45.900 --> 1:47:49.900]  I went to a meeting with 200 plus of the top owners of technology companies,
[1:47:49.900 --> 1:47:54.900]  and all they talked about was how they're going to get life extension and how they're going to kill the rest of us.
[1:47:54.900 --> 1:47:59.900]  You understand? This is science fiction. It's 2008, you idiots.
[1:47:59.900 --> 1:48:05.900]  They got a huge blackout surrounding us. We've got no future if they continue.
[1:48:05.900 --> 1:48:11.900]  You think they're going to be content with killing the Africans or killing the Asians or killing us?
[1:48:11.900 --> 1:48:18.900]  They're never going to stop until we stop them.
[1:48:18.900 --> 1:48:24.900]  Play Jeremiah Wright. Play him. Listen to this. Listen to him.
[1:48:24.900 --> 1:48:32.900]  In your sermon, you said the government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.
[1:48:32.900 --> 1:48:36.900]  So I ask you, do you honestly believe your statement and those words?
[1:48:36.900 --> 1:48:41.900]  Have you read Horowitz's book, Emerging Viruses, AIDS, and Ebola?
[1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:47.900]  Whoever wrote that question, have you read Medical apartheid? Have you read it?
[1:48:47.900 --> 1:48:55.900]  No questions from the floor. I read different things.
[1:48:55.900 --> 1:49:00.900]  As I said to my members, if you haven't read things and you can't...
[1:49:00.900 --> 1:49:05.900]  Based on this Tuskegee experiment and based on what has happened to Africans in this country,
[1:49:05.900 --> 1:49:08.900]  I believe our government is capable of doing anything.
[1:49:08.900 --> 1:49:21.900]  In fact, one of the responses to what Saddam Hussein had in terms of biological warfare was a non-question.
[1:49:21.900 --> 1:49:28.900]  Because all we had to do was check the sales records. We sold him those biological weapons that he was using against his own people.
[1:49:28.900 --> 1:49:36.900]  So any type of government can put together biological warfare to kill people and then get angry when those people use what we sold them.
[1:49:36.900 --> 1:49:39.900]  Yes, I believe we are capable.
[1:49:39.900 --> 1:49:43.900]  And I want you cops who are listening and laughing right now. God forbid I try to stop it,
[1:49:43.900 --> 1:49:53.900]  but when your 20-year-old son or daughter is dying of a rare brain tumor connected totally to the different viruses they've been caught putting in every major vaccine,
[1:49:53.900 --> 1:50:00.900]  it's been studied when you're there and your son takes that...
[1:50:00.900 --> 1:50:07.900]  When you hear that death rally or been in a room and somebody dies, I've been in a room multiple times.
[1:50:07.900 --> 1:50:12.900]  I want you to remember that you didn't listen to me because it was too good to be in a power position.
[1:50:12.900 --> 1:50:17.900]  It was too good to rationalize and make excuses about who you work for.
[1:50:17.900 --> 1:50:25.900]  I hate your guts, you cowards out there who can't admit what we've become.
[1:50:25.900 --> 1:50:33.900]  Get real! All the scumbag cowardly patriots who think this is all a game being a patriot.
[1:50:33.900 --> 1:50:37.900]  The other talk show-hosting people, you get your head screwed on straight too.
[1:50:37.900 --> 1:50:41.900]  Realize how serious this is, you little cowards.
[1:50:41.900 --> 1:50:49.900]  I'm gonna leave you.
[1:50:49.900 --> 1:50:52.900]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[1:50:52.900 --> 1:50:56.900]  Loose Change Final Cut, in-game blueprint for global enslavement.

[1:52:49.900 --> 1:52:55.900]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[1:52:55.900 --> 1:53:00.900]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[1:53:00.900 --> 1:53:06.900]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease.
[1:53:06.900 --> 1:53:12.900]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[1:53:12.900 --> 1:53:15.900]  Alcohol is intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[1:53:15.900 --> 1:53:18.900]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[1:53:18.900 --> 1:53:22.900]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[1:53:22.900 --> 1:53:27.900]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[1:53:27.900 --> 1:53:30.900]  Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[1:53:30.900 --> 1:53:39.900]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[1:54:19.900 --> 1:54:23.900]  Carrying out their operations in secret.
[1:54:23.900 --> 1:54:28.900]  And I'm blasting through your calls now. I got a bunch of news coming up.
[1:54:28.900 --> 1:54:33.900]  We've got G. Evergryphon orbiting towards the studio right now.
[1:54:33.900 --> 1:54:37.900]  Go ahead, Steve. You're on the air from Chicago.
[1:54:37.900 --> 1:54:42.900]  Yes, Alex. This is Wright. He's sailing under false colors.
[1:54:42.900 --> 1:54:48.900]  He's one of the new world order. He got a Rockefeller Fellowship.
[1:54:48.900 --> 1:54:53.900]  He's a professor in theology, University of Chicago, Chicago Theological Seminary.
[1:54:53.900 --> 1:54:55.900]  Yeah, but let's be clear. Let me just stop you.
[1:54:55.900 --> 1:54:57.900]  And I'm not defending Wright in a lot of stuff he says.
[1:54:57.900 --> 1:55:00.900]  This is a diversion. You've called before. You're going for Hillary.
[1:55:00.900 --> 1:55:03.900]  I believe they're all bad. I wouldn't vote for either one of them.
[1:55:03.900 --> 1:55:05.900]  Now, the point is there's a lot of people.
[1:55:05.900 --> 1:55:10.900]  Every Rhodes scholar doesn't serve the new order. A lot of them rebel against it.
[1:55:10.900 --> 1:55:17.900]  Just because Wright got some scholarship and the Rockefellers give out 20,000 a year or whatever doesn't mean he's exposing it.
[1:55:17.900 --> 1:55:20.900]  The proof is in the pudding. The fruit is on the tree. Go ahead.
[1:55:20.900 --> 1:55:25.900]  Well, the other point is a couple of points. You talk about him being a Korean war veteran.
[1:55:25.900 --> 1:55:29.900]  He was born September 22, 1941.
[1:55:29.900 --> 1:55:30.900]  I never talked about him being a...
[1:55:30.900 --> 1:55:32.900]  Well, I heard that. The blacks put it out.
[1:55:32.900 --> 1:55:34.900]  But you said I talk about it.
[1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:36.900]  Well, all right. I'll retract.
[1:55:36.900 --> 1:55:40.900]  That's shocking. Okay. But this has been publicized.
[1:55:40.900 --> 1:55:43.900]  You're picking on an elderly Korean war veteran.
[1:55:43.900 --> 1:55:46.900]  Hold on. Stop right there.
[1:55:46.900 --> 1:55:50.900]  First, you said that I said he was a Korean war veteran. You were saying I'm wrong. That's not true.
[1:55:50.900 --> 1:55:53.900]  Now you say I'm picking on an elderly Korean war veteran.
[1:55:53.900 --> 1:55:55.900]  Maybe I'm beating girls up in wheelchairs. Next.
[1:55:55.900 --> 1:56:03.900]  No, no. What I'm trying to say is I'm trying to say you talked about Cheney or you said this and also this right.
[1:56:03.900 --> 1:56:05.900]  No military record.
[1:56:05.900 --> 1:56:13.900]  Well, you know something? Let's look at Martin Luther Kingfish, Jesse Jackson, James Jackson, Al Sharkman.
[1:56:13.900 --> 1:56:15.900]  They had no military record.
[1:56:15.900 --> 1:56:22.900]  Black Panther, stroke Lee Carmichael, H. Crap Brown, Fred Hamster, Malcolm X-Rite. No military record.
[1:56:22.900 --> 1:56:24.900]  So what are these guys talking about?
[1:56:24.900 --> 1:56:27.900]  Seems to me that there's a false paradigm going on.
[1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:33.900]  Hey, listen. I never said that these guys were some type, you know, that this right guy is a perfect person.
[1:56:33.900 --> 1:56:41.900]  I'm saying the issue about our government testing chemicals, biologicals on everybody and they do it to black, white, doesn't matter.
[1:56:41.900 --> 1:56:47.900]  He is wrong and it needs to stop. And I said Al Sharpton is definitely the lesser of the two men.
[1:56:47.900 --> 1:56:51.900]  He is attacking Reverend Wright right now.
[1:56:51.900 --> 1:56:54.900]  Well, that's the false paradigm. They're all on the same team.
[1:56:54.900 --> 1:57:03.900]  The only other thing I condemn Hillary for talking about a bullet proof of Bush that there was in the across the ball. That never happened.
[1:57:03.900 --> 1:57:07.900]  Look, William Crystal is now endorsing Hillary.
[1:57:07.900 --> 1:57:11.900]  Operation chaos is meant to get her elected.
[1:57:11.900 --> 1:57:19.900]  Well, given the fact that, you know, we have this price, the situation with the milk and bread rackaturing.
[1:57:19.900 --> 1:57:24.900]  And they used to have FBI agents on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade.
[1:57:24.900 --> 1:57:28.900]  Maybe we need somebody in there and not let's say fair for big business.
[1:57:28.900 --> 1:57:32.900]  And I'm saying Ron Paul will go with big business and I don't believe in that.
[1:57:32.900 --> 1:57:37.900]  He says, let's government, no government, let these racketeers believe in us.
[1:57:37.900 --> 1:57:42.900]  I appreciate your call and I'm not picking on a Korean War vet. I appreciate your call and I understand the points you're making.
[1:57:42.900 --> 1:57:51.900]  But listen, big corporations lobby for big government. You've got it backwards.
[1:57:51.900 --> 1:57:55.900]  It's a fact that they get corporate welfare. They use big government to go out to their competition.
[1:57:55.900 --> 1:58:00.900]  You couldn't have this big government and all this corrupt global corporate system if you didn't have big government.
[1:58:00.900 --> 1:58:04.900]  If you didn't have people wanting big government, corporations didn't want it.
[1:58:04.900 --> 1:58:06.900]  What are global corporations? What's the new world order?
[1:58:06.900 --> 1:58:11.900]  It's global corporations setting up a world government they own and run. Real simple.
[1:58:11.900 --> 1:58:19.900]  That's the new world order. Global fascism where they use socialism to socialize us to control us, but then they keep the profit.
[1:58:19.900 --> 1:58:24.900]  It's socialism on the bottom, fascism on the top. That's the true political paradigm.
[1:58:24.900 --> 1:58:42.900]  But you won't learn that in political science. They'll teach you a load of bull.
[1:58:42.900 --> 1:58:55.900]  A new world order.
[1:58:55.900 --> 1:59:09.900]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.900 --> 1:59:14.900]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:14.900 --> 1:59:18.900]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:18.900 --> 1:59:21.900]  America's making big progress toward a world government.
[1:59:21.900 --> 1:59:25.900]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[1:59:43.900 --> 1:59:54.900]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[1:59:54.900 --> 1:59:59.900]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:59:59.900 --> 2:00:04.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[2:00:04.900 --> 2:00:09.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:09.900 --> 2:00:13.900]  Coming up, I'm going to play a clip from a Dr. Len Horowitz film that he's put out for free on Google Video.
[2:00:13.900 --> 2:00:20.900]  We have it linked in a story Paul Watson wrote today.
[2:00:20.900 --> 2:00:25.900]  It's titled, Right Says U.S. Government Capable of Creating AIDS Virus.
[2:00:25.900 --> 2:00:29.900]  Well, they got the document where they created not just that one, but a bunch of other autoimmune viruses.
[2:00:29.900 --> 2:00:37.900]  We're going to play some of this film that really breaks it down where the inventor of the Quapolio vaccine admits that they made the vaccine,
[2:00:37.900 --> 2:00:41.900]  not just out of monkeys from Africa, but from bio weapons lab.
[2:00:41.900 --> 2:00:46.900]  It all been tested on force by design. It's all very funny, of course, too. He laughs about it.
[2:00:46.900 --> 2:00:51.900]  So we'll play that and a lot more right now. Let's go back to your calls.
[2:00:51.900 --> 2:00:55.900]  Let us know who's up next here. I had my call list.
[2:00:55.900 --> 2:00:57.900]  Ben in Texas shirt on the air.
[2:00:57.900 --> 2:01:05.900]  Hey, what's going on, Alex? I really recommend you for all the big celebrities and all these top high brow, high cotton people you're bringing on the airman.
[2:01:05.900 --> 2:01:09.900]  Those are really good shows. I really like that.
[2:01:09.900 --> 2:01:16.900]  I wanted to maybe have you ever thought about getting, I know I've asked you this when you were on KLBJ. Have you ever thought about getting a moral technique on?
[2:01:16.900 --> 2:01:22.900]  Or any rap hip hop artists talk a lot about what you're talking about?
[2:01:22.900 --> 2:01:24.900]  I mean, I've had Paris on.
[2:01:24.900 --> 2:01:32.900]  Paris was awesome. I love that interview, man. I've never even actually heard any of his stuff from the program here.
[2:01:32.900 --> 2:01:39.900]  Well, at the start, at the start of the new 9-11 film I'm making, which is really a sleeper, folks.
[2:01:39.900 --> 2:01:43.900]  I can't believe how people are sitting there. This is the best film I've ever made. Wait till you see it.
[2:01:43.900 --> 2:01:46.900]  I haven't really hyped it. I should be hyping and it's amazing.
[2:01:46.900 --> 2:01:51.900]  This new film that I'm making, it starts with Paris out there with us.
[2:01:51.900 --> 2:01:55.900]  Some things he had to say on the not Paris immortal technique.
[2:01:55.900 --> 2:01:56.900]  Does it really?
[2:01:56.900 --> 2:01:57.900]  Yeah.
[2:01:57.900 --> 2:02:02.900]  Well, I'll try and shoot you some other artists. I'm sure you've heard a lot of them.
[2:02:02.900 --> 2:02:08.900]  Another question. Any plans on going on the KLBJ show in the morning?
[2:02:08.900 --> 2:02:20.900]  I mean, if they invite me, that's fine. I mean, I'm going to be on BBC5 tonight for 30 minutes debating some P-brain from BBC.
[2:02:20.900 --> 2:02:27.900]  Then I'm going to be for three hours in the Raleigh James show. I mean, I'm working all the time here. Not just what you hear on air.
[2:02:27.900 --> 2:02:32.900]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rusty in Arkansas here on the air.
[2:02:32.900 --> 2:02:35.900]  Yeah. Will that BBC piece be on Prison Planet?
[2:02:35.900 --> 2:02:39.900]  I don't know. I don't have the staff to tell them to tune in and grab it.
[2:02:39.900 --> 2:02:43.900]  In fact, I was told I was set up yesterday. I need to confirm that.
[2:02:43.900 --> 2:02:53.900]  Okay. That'd be really great to listen to, Alex. I just wanted to ask you, I know it is related, but do you think that the actual food problems we're having with the prices going up,
[2:02:53.900 --> 2:02:59.900]  are they directly related to us, the people accepting the NAU?
[2:02:59.900 --> 2:03:08.900]  And also, I haven't heard anything about the bases that were or are being built over in Iraq lately on your show.
[2:03:08.900 --> 2:03:14.900]  I hadn't really heard anything about it since Terror Storm, and I was wondering if you had any new news on that.
[2:03:14.900 --> 2:03:16.900]  Say that again?
[2:03:16.900 --> 2:03:19.900]  The permanent bases that were being built in Iraq.
[2:03:19.900 --> 2:03:26.900]  Yeah, they've built 15 permanent ones, three giant embassies. That embassy holds 4,000 people.
[2:03:26.900 --> 2:03:33.900]  Their own official Pentagon documents say they did not plan to leave for the next century, and they're going to attack Iran and Syria.
[2:03:33.900 --> 2:03:37.900]  Whenever they do that, we're not sure. And so that's the basic operation there.
[2:03:37.900 --> 2:03:42.900]  Okay. I just wondered, because I haven't heard any news on what since around Terror Storm was released.
[2:03:42.900 --> 2:03:56.900]  Also, have you talked to anybody else that has basically been saying about Bush starting another war to stay in office besides Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura?
[2:03:56.900 --> 2:04:04.900]  Well, it's certainly a danger because they see all the tools of control and the mechanisms for martial law being put in, and everybody's talking about it.
[2:04:04.900 --> 2:04:10.900]  I mean, it's public. I don't want to say Willie Nelson isn't sophisticated. I don't want to say Jesse Ventura isn't sophisticated.
[2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:20.900]  They just haven't fathomed the corruption to the level we as listeners, you know, regular listeners have, though Willie says he listens all the time.
[2:04:20.900 --> 2:04:27.900]  It's bigger than just Bush. I think they know that. It's institutional, so it may not be Bush that does it. It could be Hillary, Barack Obama, McCain doesn't matter.
[2:04:27.900 --> 2:04:30.900]  They're all from the same cloth. I appreciate your call, sir.
[2:04:30.900 --> 2:04:35.900]  We're going to come back, take a few more calls. Then I'm going to play some of this Len Horowitz film.

[2:08:02.900 --> 2:08:06.900]  Horowitz has got like a two-hour, 20-minute film out.
[2:08:06.900 --> 2:08:11.900]  Oh, I watched it months ago. What's the name of it, John?
[2:08:11.900 --> 2:08:16.900]  In Lies We Trust, that's right. I'm going to play like 15 minutes of it and you have a reference coming into the studio.
[2:08:16.900 --> 2:08:19.900]  Got a bunch of other news we'll be covering, but...
[2:08:19.900 --> 2:08:23.900]  And there's this huge news from We Are Changed going up on InfoWars.
[2:08:23.900 --> 2:08:27.900]  Gary Hart, Newt Gainridge, what's the other one?
[2:08:27.900 --> 2:08:31.900]  Ted Turner admitting he wants a one-child policy in the U.S.
[2:08:31.900 --> 2:08:34.900]  Then being screamed at and told that we're not his slave.
[2:08:34.900 --> 2:08:39.900]  Just wonderful stuff that's going up. I just, you can't beat it. It's so wonderful.
[2:08:39.900 --> 2:08:42.900]  And it's going to happen more and more with these criminals.
[2:08:42.900 --> 2:08:44.900]  Let's go ahead and...
[2:08:44.900 --> 2:08:48.900]  And yes, he gave a billion bucks for eugenics in Africa.
[2:08:48.900 --> 2:08:51.900]  So sick. And see the mainstream media is in on it.
[2:08:51.900 --> 2:08:55.900]  He gave money to help them. We are helping them now.
[2:08:55.900 --> 2:08:59.900]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rodney in Kentucky. You're on the air.
[2:08:59.900 --> 2:09:02.900]  Hey, Alex, man. It sure is great to hear from you, dude.
[2:09:02.900 --> 2:09:08.900]  Just wanted to let you know that you got a whole group of guys down here, families, everything.
[2:09:08.900 --> 2:09:14.900]  Pray for you on a daily basis, man, to make sure that you can continue to do what you're doing.
[2:09:14.900 --> 2:09:18.900]  You know, we truly think that you are just a lone voice and a wilderness crying out, man.
[2:09:18.900 --> 2:09:20.900]  And we appreciate everything you do.
[2:09:20.900 --> 2:09:22.900]  Well, I love you guys too. I couldn't do it without all of you.
[2:09:22.900 --> 2:09:27.900]  Well, one of the main things I just called in real quick, I just think it's one of the things I think most people, your listeners,
[2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:32.900]  need to concentrate on is, like you say, don't drink the tap water.
[2:09:32.900 --> 2:09:38.900]  Drink the still water. Get off the coffee. Go to green tea. Work out. Get yourself in shape.
[2:09:38.900 --> 2:09:43.900]  Lift weights. Run. Train in some type of serious, not McDow Joe.
[2:09:43.900 --> 2:09:46.900]  These Taekwondo places that open up on every corner to babysit your kids.
[2:09:46.900 --> 2:09:51.900]  A real Chinese martial art or especially Kali, the Filipino martial arts where you learn.
[2:09:51.900 --> 2:09:54.900]  These guys are always, you know, you see in these riots and everything.
[2:09:54.900 --> 2:09:57.900]  They're always, the police always use no sticks against innocent civilians.
[2:09:57.900 --> 2:10:02.900]  If you learn how to use that stick yourself, believe me, you can defend yourself against stuff like that.
[2:10:02.900 --> 2:10:06.900]  You know, don't eat crap. Try to eat good. Don't listen to what these studies are saying.
[2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:07.900]  Take the supplement.
[2:10:07.900 --> 2:10:13.900]  Yeah, realize that the media and the government is our enemy and it's a false paradigm.
[2:10:13.900 --> 2:10:15.900]  Realize we're literally like in a matrix.
[2:10:15.900 --> 2:10:16.900]  Exactly.
[2:10:16.900 --> 2:10:20.900]  But it's a mental matrix where everybody's just playing along.
[2:10:20.900 --> 2:10:22.900]  No, we're under attack.
[2:10:22.900 --> 2:10:27.900]  But if you get up off that couch and do something, get physically active, get yourself in shape,
[2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:31.900]  you can break out of that matrix. You will think clear. You will have a purpose.
[2:10:31.900 --> 2:10:34.900]  And I mean, to me, that's just like, what's the old saying?
[2:10:34.900 --> 2:10:36.900]  Well, he, you know, that lives best wins.
[2:10:36.900 --> 2:10:40.900]  That's true. If we can live good, we can live healthy, we can beat these guys, man.
[2:10:40.900 --> 2:10:45.900]  There's no, you know, buy supplement, buy everything, stock up on stuff so that you don't need to go out
[2:10:45.900 --> 2:10:48.900]  and stand in these bread lines and these food lines and go to us.
[2:10:48.900 --> 2:10:51.900]  Have this stuff so you can be at home with your family and fight in the new world.
[2:10:51.900 --> 2:10:52.900]  Exactly.
[2:10:52.900 --> 2:10:55.900]  Another quick thing is there, I don't know if anybody has seen or not,
[2:10:55.900 --> 2:10:58.900]  but there is a material out called four shield.
[2:10:58.900 --> 2:11:03.900]  I hope you can understand it with my old Southern accent that defeats the tasers.
[2:11:03.900 --> 2:11:06.900]  It's material that defeats tasers called four shield.
[2:11:06.900 --> 2:11:07.900]  Look it up on the internet.
[2:11:07.900 --> 2:11:08.900]  Yeah, that's a, that's a clue thing.
[2:11:08.900 --> 2:11:09.900]  Sure. Thank you.
[2:11:09.900 --> 2:11:10.900]  Great call. Call me back again.
[2:11:10.900 --> 2:11:13.900]  I got to move fast because I want to take some more calls and go to this video.
[2:11:13.900 --> 2:11:16.900]  But earlier, somebody walked in during the break was talking to me,
[2:11:16.900 --> 2:11:20.900]  so I didn't, I didn't really focus on what the last caller Rodney, you know,
[2:11:20.900 --> 2:11:23.900]  what Rodney was Rusty in Arkansas said.
[2:11:23.900 --> 2:11:28.900]  And Rusty was saying, do you think this is real about the food and gas?
[2:11:28.900 --> 2:11:31.900]  Or one of the callers was the point is.
[2:11:31.900 --> 2:11:32.900]  Yes.
[2:11:32.900 --> 2:11:35.900]  Well, it's three different things, mainly.
[2:11:35.900 --> 2:11:43.900]  It's that big agris bought up most of the large areas of the growing belts and has been cutting back on what they produce.
[2:11:43.900 --> 2:11:45.900]  They've shut down most of the family farms.
[2:11:45.900 --> 2:11:52.900]  They're shutting down the rest or trying to also the dollars been massively devalued.
[2:11:52.900 --> 2:11:55.900]  Okay.
[2:11:55.900 --> 2:12:00.900]  And at the same time, the US government is shipping a lot of our food out as emergency aid.
[2:12:00.900 --> 2:12:04.900]  So the dollars down so it's cheaper to buy food from us now because it, you know,
[2:12:04.900 --> 2:12:07.900]  it's like we're pesos or something foreign countries can buy it cheap.
[2:12:07.900 --> 2:12:18.900]  A, B, you know, subset of that same point, our government's taking hundreds of millions of dollars of our food every month and giving it as aid.
[2:12:18.900 --> 2:12:21.900]  And the dollars been devalued on top of it.
[2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:22.900]  And then there's another point.
[2:12:22.900 --> 2:12:25.900]  There's another reason because I've been studying this for a while.
[2:12:25.900 --> 2:12:28.900]  I was just thinking of it and there's so many thoughts.
[2:12:28.900 --> 2:12:31.900]  What's frustrating about this show that I forget.
[2:12:31.900 --> 2:12:35.900]  What's the other big key other big key?
[2:12:35.900 --> 2:12:39.900]  Oh, man.
[2:12:39.900 --> 2:12:43.900]  It's one of the most important to all of this happening.
[2:12:43.900 --> 2:12:46.900]  But the United Nations said, I can't remember, it'll pop my head in a minute.
[2:12:46.900 --> 2:12:52.900]  The United Nations said in the 1997 UN Food Summit in Beijing that they would quote,
[2:12:52.900 --> 2:12:55.900]  use food as a weapon in the State Department of Random 200.
[2:12:55.900 --> 2:12:58.900]  It's official INF and World Bank documents that came out in 2002.
[2:12:58.900 --> 2:13:01.900]  I mean, though those are the sources, just some of them.
[2:13:01.900 --> 2:13:06.900]  Thousands of others, there's the Royal Commission on Population 44 to 49.
[2:13:06.900 --> 2:13:10.900]  But I was just giving you some of the newer ones that have leaked out.
[2:13:10.900 --> 2:13:12.900]  The IMF admits those are real, by the way.
[2:13:12.900 --> 2:13:14.900]  They're very upset about them coming out.
[2:13:14.900 --> 2:13:15.900]  We know who leaked them.
[2:13:15.900 --> 2:13:16.900]  Was he on the show this week?
[2:13:16.900 --> 2:13:18.900]  No wonder.
[2:13:18.900 --> 2:13:19.900]  Or was it last week?
[2:13:19.900 --> 2:13:20.900]  Stiklets.
[2:13:20.900 --> 2:13:24.900]  But, you know, some of these guys still have morals.
[2:13:24.900 --> 2:13:27.900]  I mean, Stiklets were, you know, economists of Nobel Prize winner,
[2:13:27.900 --> 2:13:30.900]  but he did go public and say, I'm not going to be part of this.
[2:13:30.900 --> 2:13:33.900]  He believes in globalism, but not the tyrannical type.
[2:13:33.900 --> 2:13:37.900]  Well, the point is anything that's big and centralized is going to be tyrannical.
[2:13:37.900 --> 2:13:44.900]  But the food crisis is real.
[2:13:44.900 --> 2:13:47.900]  Oh, I forgot, climate.
[2:13:47.900 --> 2:13:52.900]  There's also been a lot of weird climatological things that have happened,
[2:13:52.900 --> 2:13:54.900]  that have reduced food production as well.
[2:13:54.900 --> 2:13:56.900]  So climate plays into that.
[2:13:56.900 --> 2:13:57.900]  Okay, there we go.
[2:13:57.900 --> 2:14:01.900]  Now, let's talk to Jack.
[2:14:01.900 --> 2:14:04.900]  Jack, where are you calling me from?
[2:14:04.900 --> 2:14:05.900]  Hello there.
[2:14:05.900 --> 2:14:06.900]  Does Alex?
[2:14:06.900 --> 2:14:07.900]  Yeah.
[2:14:07.900 --> 2:14:08.900]  Hey, I was just making a joke.
[2:14:08.900 --> 2:14:10.900]  I was Officer Jack Boot.
[2:14:10.900 --> 2:14:11.900]  Oh, okay.
[2:14:11.900 --> 2:14:14.900]  From your show, I don't know when that was.
[2:14:14.900 --> 2:14:16.900]  I just saw it on YouTube and had a laugh.
[2:14:16.900 --> 2:14:17.900]  It was about a week and a half ago.
[2:14:17.900 --> 2:14:19.900]  Yeah, that was great.
[2:14:19.900 --> 2:14:21.900]  Yeah, so I'm doing my best, man.
[2:14:21.900 --> 2:14:24.900]  I'm going out there and I'm making everybody tune into your stuff.
[2:14:24.900 --> 2:14:26.900]  Watch your movies.
[2:14:26.900 --> 2:14:31.900]  You know, I just like my, I got my mom now watching it and she can barely stand it.
[2:14:31.900 --> 2:14:34.900]  You know, she just retired and she's just like, you got to take this call.
[2:14:34.900 --> 2:14:39.900]  She feels that she's too old for it, but she, you know, she's starting to get disgusted.
[2:14:39.900 --> 2:14:43.900]  I got like Netflix, got your movies coming in so I can show them to her.
[2:14:43.900 --> 2:14:46.900]  And I wanted to say I donated some money to those guys,
[2:14:46.900 --> 2:14:51.900]  but I went to the meetup group thing and I wasn't able to find the PayPal donation.
[2:14:51.900 --> 2:14:55.900]  So if anybody wants to donate to them, I was able to get to the wearchange.org.
[2:14:55.900 --> 2:15:02.900]  And there my one question is since we're doing, I'm doing all I can and I mean,
[2:15:02.900 --> 2:15:06.900]  I even talked to people I haven't talked to in ages and I just mentioned Ron Paul
[2:15:06.900 --> 2:15:09.900]  and say, oh, I've been working hard and trying to get this guy because the Federal Reserve
[2:15:09.900 --> 2:15:10.900]  and everything.
[2:15:10.900 --> 2:15:12.900]  And they actually say, who is Ron Paul?
[2:15:12.900 --> 2:15:14.900]  And I mean, I can't believe it.
[2:15:14.900 --> 2:15:17.900]  Well, I mean, one-fifth of Americans can't find the U.S. on a map.
[2:15:17.900 --> 2:15:20.900]  80 plus percent don't know who the vice president is.
[2:15:20.900 --> 2:15:24.900]  So the elite would say they don't count all that counts as people that are involved
[2:15:24.900 --> 2:15:26.900]  and in a way that's true.
[2:15:26.900 --> 2:15:30.900]  So just when somebody's drooling at you, just just move on.
[2:15:30.900 --> 2:15:31.900]  Yeah.
[2:15:31.900 --> 2:15:34.900]  Well, how do we get like, how do we get your movies or how do we get this message
[2:15:34.900 --> 2:15:35.900]  into the mainstream?
[2:15:35.900 --> 2:15:39.900]  I mean, is there is there a way that we could buy time on the major networks,
[2:15:39.900 --> 2:15:43.900]  you know, do a big promotion, set up a website and say, we know they're dying.
[2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:46.900]  And those one-shot wonders really don't work.
[2:15:46.900 --> 2:15:49.900]  It's just the overall death by a million cuts.
[2:15:49.900 --> 2:15:53.900]  We're hitting them newsletters, websites, calling into talk shows,
[2:15:53.900 --> 2:15:56.900]  confronting politicians, taking over media events.
[2:15:56.900 --> 2:15:59.900]  I mean, when you take over some Bill Clinton event on ABC News,
[2:15:59.900 --> 2:16:01.900]  you know, 10 million people see it.
[2:16:01.900 --> 2:16:02.900]  Yeah.
[2:16:02.900 --> 2:16:07.900]  So, you know, you go up with a $300 handicap and ask Gary Hart about why he said
[2:16:07.900 --> 2:16:09.900]  the government stages terror attacks and he admits it.
[2:16:09.900 --> 2:16:12.900]  And then hundreds of thousands will see that in the next year,
[2:16:12.900 --> 2:16:14.900]  millions over the next few years.
[2:16:14.900 --> 2:16:15.900]  It just keeps building.
[2:16:15.900 --> 2:16:16.900]  It doesn't go away.
[2:16:16.900 --> 2:16:19.900]  And again, it's thousands of those things are happening.
[2:16:19.900 --> 2:16:22.900]  I mean, we are changes confronting about 20 people a week I know of.
[2:16:22.900 --> 2:16:24.900]  It's getting more and more insane by the minute.
[2:16:24.900 --> 2:16:28.900]  I mean, Jimmy Carter just called for a new 9-11 investigation and said he was
[2:16:28.900 --> 2:16:30.900]  concerned about false flag terror.
[2:16:30.900 --> 2:16:33.900]  I mean, it's incredible what's happening.
[2:16:33.900 --> 2:16:34.900]  Right.
[2:16:34.900 --> 2:16:36.900]  And one more question if you have time.
[2:16:36.900 --> 2:16:38.900]  I saw you're in one of your videos.
[2:16:38.900 --> 2:16:40.900]  Maybe I saw it on YouTube.
[2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:45.900]  You refused the thumb scan to get a driver's license.
[2:16:45.900 --> 2:16:46.900]  Yes.
[2:16:46.900 --> 2:16:51.900]  And I just moved like close to a year now from Las Vegas back here to Florida
[2:16:51.900 --> 2:16:52.900]  to some economic problems.
[2:16:52.900 --> 2:16:53.900]  Okay.
[2:16:53.900 --> 2:16:54.900]  I moved back in my mom's stuff.
[2:16:54.900 --> 2:16:56.900]  I was almost 40 years old.
[2:16:56.900 --> 2:16:59.900]  But basically, I had a passport.
[2:16:59.900 --> 2:17:00.900]  And that's now expired.
[2:17:00.900 --> 2:17:02.900]  And I haven't got a driver's license yet.
[2:17:02.900 --> 2:17:05.900]  And I don't have any valid ID, but it's not that I'm off.
[2:17:05.900 --> 2:17:06.900]  I got a bank account.
[2:17:06.900 --> 2:17:07.900]  No, I understand.
[2:17:07.900 --> 2:17:08.900]  So go ahead.
[2:17:08.900 --> 2:17:09.900]  Tell me.
[2:17:09.900 --> 2:17:10.900]  Did you ever get a driver's license?
[2:17:10.900 --> 2:17:11.900]  No.
[2:17:11.900 --> 2:17:12.900]  And I appreciate your call.
[2:17:12.900 --> 2:17:13.900]  I did get a driver's license.
[2:17:13.900 --> 2:17:14.900]  Now, let me explain this.
[2:17:14.900 --> 2:17:16.900]  That was 10 years ago.
[2:17:16.900 --> 2:17:19.900]  No, that was 11 years ago, 1997.
[2:17:19.900 --> 2:17:25.900]  And I said then, I said, we're trying to beat the National ID card now.
[2:17:25.900 --> 2:17:28.900]  Once it's in place, it needs to be politically changed.
[2:17:28.900 --> 2:17:34.900]  And so, yes, I didn't have one for from 97 to 2002.
[2:17:34.900 --> 2:17:35.900]  I know 2003.
[2:17:35.900 --> 2:17:38.900]  Actually, I need to look on my driver's license to tell you.
[2:17:38.900 --> 2:17:41.900]  Let me just look.
[2:17:41.900 --> 2:17:44.900]  I know what's about to expire.
[2:17:44.900 --> 2:17:47.900]  Yeah.
[2:17:47.900 --> 2:17:52.900]  It expires in 2010.
[2:17:52.900 --> 2:17:57.900]  I guess it doesn't say when I got it.
[2:17:57.900 --> 2:18:02.900]  But the point here is that I'm in the control grid.
[2:18:02.900 --> 2:18:05.900]  So I've chosen to do that for easier movement and things.
[2:18:05.900 --> 2:18:07.900]  I'm already tracking my cell phone.
[2:18:07.900 --> 2:18:09.900]  I don't just have NSA listening to me with computers.
[2:18:09.900 --> 2:18:11.900]  I have actual people assigned to me.
[2:18:11.900 --> 2:18:15.900]  And I hope they enjoy the eugenic attack they're under from their bosses.
[2:18:15.900 --> 2:18:18.900]  That's what I always tell them when I'm on the phone.
[2:18:18.900 --> 2:18:24.900]  So it's just like I pay the income tax to the private banks.
[2:18:24.900 --> 2:18:28.900]  I mean, we just saw Wesley Snipes get 33 months in prison.
[2:18:28.900 --> 2:18:30.900]  And that's when he had good lawyers who got him off the felonies.
[2:18:30.900 --> 2:18:32.900]  Those were the misdemeanors.
[2:18:32.900 --> 2:18:34.900]  And so I have CPA certify it and all that.
[2:18:34.900 --> 2:18:37.900]  And I know I waived my fifth amendment and it's all criminal and it's a joke.
[2:18:37.900 --> 2:18:39.900]  And they lie all the time anyways.
[2:18:39.900 --> 2:18:42.900]  The point is I'm choosing my battles.
[2:18:42.900 --> 2:18:48.900]  I choose to just attack them, to expose them, to prove what they are instead of,
[2:18:48.900 --> 2:18:51.900]  because I'm a high profile target, instead of giving them excuses.
[2:18:51.900 --> 2:18:55.900]  I mean, I have a very clean nose.
[2:18:55.900 --> 2:18:59.900]  I keep myself clean as you can get.
[2:18:59.900 --> 2:19:01.900]  I do a speed a little bit.
[2:19:01.900 --> 2:19:03.900]  But the point is about it.
[2:19:03.900 --> 2:19:06.900]  So I try not to, you know, beat the hell out of people.
[2:19:06.900 --> 2:19:09.900]  Because I do like to get in fist fights and it's a problem.
[2:19:09.900 --> 2:19:14.900]  But other than that, I'm a pretty straight-laced person.
[2:19:14.900 --> 2:19:20.900]  And that doesn't mean that they still won't try to set me up or do something.
[2:19:20.900 --> 2:19:23.900]  And by the way, I'm not saying I try to keep from not losing my temper,
[2:19:23.900 --> 2:19:24.900]  because I'm tough.
[2:19:24.900 --> 2:19:26.900]  It's a weakness.
[2:19:26.900 --> 2:19:30.900]  You know, I just tell listeners the truth about my life and who I am and why I am.
[2:19:30.900 --> 2:19:32.900]  And I tell those stories about growing up.
[2:19:32.900 --> 2:19:34.900]  Those are all true, by the way.
[2:19:34.900 --> 2:19:35.900]  Like everything else.
[2:19:35.900 --> 2:19:37.900]  Every claim I've made, it's like John Wayne.
[2:19:37.900 --> 2:19:38.900]  No brag, just fact.
[2:19:38.900 --> 2:19:39.900]  All right, we'll be right back.
[2:19:39.900 --> 2:19:42.900]  We're going to play a few minutes of the Horowitz video.
[2:19:42.900 --> 2:19:43.900]  We'll play that at the end.
[2:19:43.900 --> 2:19:45.900]  G.F.R. Griffin's going to be with us for about an hour and 15 minutes.
[2:19:45.900 --> 2:19:47.900]  Stay with us.
[2:19:47.900 --> 2:19:50.900]  It is a big idea.
[2:19:50.900 --> 2:19:52.900]  A new world order.
[2:19:52.900 --> 2:19:57.900]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:19:57.900 --> 2:19:59.900]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[2:19:59.900 --> 2:20:02.900]  What's their objective, the world domination?
[2:20:02.900 --> 2:20:05.900]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:20:05.900 --> 2:20:08.900]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:20:08.900 --> 2:20:13.900]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:13.900 --> 2:20:17.900]  For the first time in history,
[2:20:17.900 --> 2:20:21.900]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:20:21.900 --> 2:20:25.900]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:20:25.900 --> 2:20:28.900]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:20:28.900 --> 2:20:29.900]  Most people have no idea.
[2:20:29.900 --> 2:20:30.900]  They're not after money.
[2:20:30.900 --> 2:20:31.900]  They have all the money they need.
[2:20:31.900 --> 2:20:32.900]  They're after power.
[2:20:32.900 --> 2:20:33.900]  That's their aptitude.

[2:22:47.900 --> 2:22:49.900]  Hi, my name's Don Wiskinen.
[2:22:49.900 --> 2:22:52.900]  For over seven years, I've been telling people about Cardivite.
[2:22:52.900 --> 2:22:56.900]  Here's Dr. John Matz and a naturopathic doctor in his views on Cardivite.
[2:22:56.900 --> 2:22:59.900]  I would like to thank you, Don, for making my job so much easier
[2:22:59.900 --> 2:23:01.900]  because your products just make it so simple, right?
[2:23:01.900 --> 2:23:04.900]  To fool around with a lot of exotic things that don't work.
[2:23:04.900 --> 2:23:07.900]  We can just put them on Cardivite and things start to work almost right away.
[2:23:07.900 --> 2:23:11.900]  There's dozens and dozens of patients with heart problems who have corrected them,
[2:23:11.900 --> 2:23:15.900]  and what it's doing, there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast killing effect.
[2:23:15.900 --> 2:23:18.900]  That yeast is a big problem in the gut, pushes the liver heart,
[2:23:18.900 --> 2:23:20.900]  and also has metal chelating effect,
[2:23:20.900 --> 2:23:23.900]  and most of the other herbs in there are finding strength in the arteries
[2:23:23.900 --> 2:23:25.900]  to help to neutralize free radicals.
[2:23:25.900 --> 2:23:28.900]  Your remedy is as close to what we do in our program
[2:23:28.900 --> 2:23:30.900]  as you can get as far as one supplement goes.
[2:23:30.900 --> 2:23:33.900]  It's working on the gut, it's working on the liver,
[2:23:33.900 --> 2:23:36.900]  it's working on the arteries, what more can you ask for?
[2:23:36.900 --> 2:23:40.900]  If you want more, call 1-877-928-8822
[2:23:40.900 --> 2:23:43.900]  or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[2:23:43.900 --> 2:24:07.900]  Don't worry, this show is documented. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:24:19.900 --> 2:24:23.900]  So, I went down to see Bill Mann at the Zoo in Washington, D.C.
[2:24:23.900 --> 2:24:26.900]  and I told Bill Mann, I said, look, here's a, I got a problem.
[2:24:26.900 --> 2:24:28.900]  I don't know what the hell to do.
[2:24:28.900 --> 2:24:31.900]  Bill Mann was a very bright guy.
[2:24:31.900 --> 2:24:34.900]  I said, these lousy monkeys are picking it up
[2:24:34.900 --> 2:24:38.900]  and while being stored in the airports in transit,
[2:24:38.900 --> 2:24:43.900]  he's loading off what I mean. He said, very simply, he said,
[2:24:43.900 --> 2:24:47.900]  you go ahead, get your monkeys out of West Africa
[2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:50.900]  and get the African green, bring them into Madrid,
[2:24:50.900 --> 2:24:54.900]  unload them there, there are no other traffic through there for animals,
[2:24:54.900 --> 2:24:57.900]  fly them into Philadelphia, pick them up,
[2:24:57.900 --> 2:25:02.900]  or fly them into New York and pick them up right off the airplane.
[2:25:02.900 --> 2:25:07.900]  So I brought African greens and I didn't know we were recording AIDS verse at the time.
[2:25:07.900 --> 2:25:09.900] owego, Hi hi.
[2:25:09.900 --> 2:25:11.900]  Well, you know, we're gonna do AIDS verse at the conference.
[2:25:11.900 --> 2:25:13.900]  You know, we're gonna do AIDS verse at the conference.
[2:25:13.900 --> 2:25:15.900]  Now we got, wow.
[2:25:15.900 --> 2:25:16.900]  No.
[2:25:16.900 --> 2:25:20.900]  A real story, a real story.
[2:25:20.900 --> 2:25:21.900]  A real story.
[2:25:21.900 --> 2:25:22.900]  A real story.
[2:25:22.900 --> 2:25:23.900]  A real story.
[2:25:23.900 --> 2:25:24.900]  A real story.
[2:25:24.900 --> 2:25:25.900]  A real story.
[2:25:25.900 --> 2:25:26.900]  A real story.
[2:25:26.900 --> 2:25:31.900]  So, what he did, he brought in, I mean, we brought in those monkeys,
[2:25:31.900 --> 2:25:33.900]  now we had those.
[2:25:33.900 --> 2:25:39.480]  And this was the solution, because those monkeys didn't have the wild viruses, but we had all
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:40.480]  these...
[2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:42.160]  Why didn't the greens have the wild viruses since they came from Africa?
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:46.800]  Because they weren't, well, they weren't, they weren't being infected in these group
[2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:50.280]  holding things with all the other 40 different viruses.
[2:25:50.280 --> 2:25:51.800]  But they had the ones they brought from the jungle, though.
[2:25:51.800 --> 2:25:54.800]  Yeah, they had those, but there were relatively few.
[2:25:54.800 --> 2:25:59.600]  What you do is you have a gang housing, you're going to have an epidemic transmission of
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:01.840]  infection in a confined space.
[2:26:01.840 --> 2:26:03.040]  Oh, is that the problem?
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:10.440]  So anyway, the greens came in, and now we had these, and then we're taking our seed
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:16.640]  stocks to clean them up, and God, now I'm discovering new viruses.
[2:26:16.640 --> 2:26:20.240]  So I said, shoot us, priest.
[2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:25.320]  Well, I got an invitation from the Sister Kenny Foundation, which was the opposing foundation,
[2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:27.320]  and that was the live virus.
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:28.320]  Oh, right.
[2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:32.960]  Yeah, they had jumped on Sabin's bandwagon, and they had asked me to come down and give
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:39.640]  a talk at the Sister Kenny Foundation meeting, and I said it was an international meeting.
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:41.640]  I'm like, God, what am I going to talk about?
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:43.400]  I know what I'm going to do.
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:50.280]  I'm going to talk about the detection of non-detectable viruses as a topic.
[2:26:50.280 --> 2:26:54.040]  There were those who did more than live virus vaccine.
[2:26:54.040 --> 2:26:58.880]  They concentrated, National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis concentrated all its
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:06.280]  efforts on getting more and more people to use the killed virus vaccine, while they were
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:10.320]  supporting me for research on the live virus vaccine.
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:14.680]  So now I got to have something, you know, that's going to attract attention.
[2:27:14.680 --> 2:27:19.840]  So I thought, gee, that damn SP-40, I mean that damn vaculating agent that we have,
[2:27:19.840 --> 2:27:22.480]  I'm going to just pick that particular one.
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:28.840]  That virus has got to be in vaccines, and it's got to be in Sabin's vaccine.
[2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:36.680]  So I quick-fitted and tested it, sure enough it was in there, and so now, so I go ahead
[2:27:36.680 --> 2:27:37.680]  and...
[2:27:37.680 --> 2:27:40.680]  So you just took stocks of Sabin's vaccine off the shelf here at Merkin?
[2:27:40.680 --> 2:27:42.360]  Yeah, well, no, I'd been made at Merkin.
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:43.560]  It was made at Merkin.
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:45.080]  You were making it for Sabin at this point?
[2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:47.000]  Yeah, it was made before I came.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:50.840]  Yeah, but at this point Sabin is still just doing these massive field trials.
[2:27:50.840 --> 2:27:51.840]  Okay.
[2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:52.840]  In Russia and so forth.
[2:27:52.840 --> 2:28:00.120]  So I go down, I talked about the detection of the non-tech virus, and I told Albert...
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:03.040]  But at this point Sabin is still just doing these massive field trials?
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:04.040]  Mm-hmm.
[2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:05.040]  Okay.
[2:28:05.040 --> 2:28:06.040]  In Russia and so forth.
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:12.040]  So I go down, I talked about the detection of the non-tech virus, and I told Albert,
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:15.040]  I said, listen Albert, I said, you know, you and I are good friends.
[2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:19.480]  But I said, I'm going to go down there and you're going to get out of the set.
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:23.560]  Okay, I'm going to talk about a virus that's in your vaccine now.
[2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:26.640]  You're going to get rid of the virus, don't worry about it, you're going to get rid of
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:27.640]  it.
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:28.640]  But...
[2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:33.880]  So of course Albert was very upset with me.
[2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:34.880]  What did he say?
[2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:41.960]  Well, he said basically that this is just another obfuscation that is going to upset the vaccines.
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:46.160]  And I said, well, you know, you're absolutely right, but I said we have a new era here.
[2:28:46.160 --> 2:28:50.920]  We have a new era of a detection, and the important thing is to get rid of these viruses.
[2:28:50.920 --> 2:28:54.520]  Why would he call it an obfuscation if it was a virus that was contaminating the vaccine?
[2:28:54.520 --> 2:28:59.320]  Well, because, well, there are 40 different viruses in these vaccines anyway that we weren't
[2:28:59.320 --> 2:29:00.320]  activating.
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:01.320]  And...
[2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:03.320]  But you weren't activating the...
[2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:04.320]  That's correct.
[2:29:04.320 --> 2:29:05.320]  No, that's right.
[2:29:05.320 --> 2:29:10.880]  But the yellow fever vaccine had leukemia, virus and everything, you know, this is in
[2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:12.880]  the days of very crude science.
[2:29:12.880 --> 2:29:17.320]  So anyway, I went down and talked to him, and I said, well, why are you concerned about
[2:29:17.320 --> 2:29:18.320]  it?
[2:29:18.320 --> 2:29:23.120]  I said, well, I'll tell you what, I said, I have a feeling in my bones that this virus
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:24.120]  is different.
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:27.920]  I don't know why to tell you this, but I've been around bottles all the time, I just
[2:29:27.920 --> 2:29:30.320]  think this virus may have some long-term effects.
[2:29:30.320 --> 2:29:32.320]  And he said, what?
[2:29:32.320 --> 2:29:34.320]  I said, what?
[2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:39.320]  And he said, well...
[2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:40.560]  We're on the march.
[2:29:40.560 --> 2:29:43.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:46.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:46.560 --> 2:29:52.240]  Hi, neighbor.
[2:29:52.240 --> 2:29:54.400]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[2:29:54.400 --> 2:29:58.160]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[2:29:58.160 --> 2:30:03.400]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[2:30:03.400 --> 2:30:05.920]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[2:30:05.920 --> 2:30:09.640]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees, along with huge crop failures from
[2:30:09.640 --> 2:30:12.240]  all-time record water shortages.
[2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:16.800]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[2:30:16.800 --> 2:30:21.160]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[2:30:21.160 --> 2:30:25.440]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan
[2:30:25.440 --> 2:30:26.880]  for America.
[2:30:26.880 --> 2:30:31.560]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose
[2:30:31.560 --> 2:30:35.680]  to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.

[2:33:29.540 --> 2:33:35.860]  G. Edward Griffin, really a legend in the alternative media, new order resistance movement.
[2:33:35.860 --> 2:33:44.300]  One of the last living icons, the great granddaddies, in the fight is a sharp handsome devil for
[2:33:44.300 --> 2:33:47.940]  being in the fight this long, and it's good to have him here with us.
[2:33:47.940 --> 2:33:53.060]  Very long bio up on Wikipedia, a lot of different websites, scores of films he's made.
[2:33:53.060 --> 2:33:56.740]  He has, of course, the bestselling author of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[2:33:56.740 --> 2:34:03.300]  He founded in 2002 Freedom Force International, and he is in studio with us today.
[2:34:03.300 --> 2:34:04.300]  Mr. Griffin, thanks for coming in.
[2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:05.540]  G. Well, thanks a lot, Alex.
[2:34:05.540 --> 2:34:06.540]  It's really a pleasure to be here.
[2:34:06.540 --> 2:34:08.180]  G. It's a pleasure to have you with us.
[2:34:08.180 --> 2:34:11.900]  You're going to be speaking tonight, later in Austin at UTG at 8 o'clock, but we'll talk
[2:34:11.900 --> 2:34:14.220]  about that later, right now.
[2:34:14.220 --> 2:34:18.220]  Tell us about G. Edward Griffin, tell us about your life, tell us about the experiences
[2:34:18.220 --> 2:34:19.220]  you've had.
[2:34:19.220 --> 2:34:21.300]  I mean, I know you don't like to talk about yourself, but I mean, the scope, how long
[2:34:21.300 --> 2:34:24.300]  you've been in this, the films you've made, spend 10 minutes on that.
[2:34:24.300 --> 2:34:25.300]  G. 10 minutes.
[2:34:25.300 --> 2:34:28.180]  Well, you're going to lose your audience on this one.
[2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:29.180]  It's really not that much.
[2:34:29.180 --> 2:34:31.900]  I'm basically a writer, Alex, as everybody knows.
[2:34:31.900 --> 2:34:39.460]  I started into this field, this freedom field, if you want to call it that, in 1959.
[2:34:39.460 --> 2:34:44.020]  In 1960, I was up to speed, I was very alarmed about what was going on in the world.
[2:34:44.020 --> 2:34:48.380]  And I quit my job, which was a comfortable job with an insurance company, and I became
[2:34:48.380 --> 2:34:50.020]  a crusader.
[2:34:50.020 --> 2:34:54.540]  And my first issues back in those days had to do with the United Nations.
[2:34:54.540 --> 2:34:59.660]  Now, I went through school, I was taught that the UN was our last best hope for peace.
[2:34:59.660 --> 2:35:04.220]  It was a means by which all nations could join together in peace and brotherhood and
[2:35:04.220 --> 2:35:05.220]  all that stuff.
[2:35:05.220 --> 2:35:09.860]  I went into it lock, stock, and barrel, and then one day I opened up a pamphlet, and the
[2:35:09.860 --> 2:35:14.140]  author of the pamphlet was a college professor from some Midwest University, and he was telling
[2:35:14.140 --> 2:35:16.900]  me that this was all a false image.
[2:35:16.900 --> 2:35:20.700]  What these guys actually had in mind, we had nothing to do with peace and brotherhood,
[2:35:20.700 --> 2:35:22.820]  but totalitarian control over the world.
[2:35:22.820 --> 2:35:25.780]  Well, that upset me, and I didn't believe it, of course.
[2:35:25.780 --> 2:35:27.740]  But anyway, you asked about my history.
[2:35:27.740 --> 2:35:32.340]  That is the first thing that nudged me, and made me start to think about the assumptions
[2:35:32.340 --> 2:35:33.340]  that I had.
[2:35:33.340 --> 2:35:37.060]  I'm pretty shy because this journey, I mean, you woke up back when hardly anybody was awake.
[2:35:37.060 --> 2:35:40.820]  This journey is important for other people out there who are having similar journeys,
[2:35:40.820 --> 2:35:45.500]  and I think it's an example of what one person can do after they wake up and decide, I want
[2:35:45.500 --> 2:35:49.460]  to stand up for goodness, I want to stand up against evil, I want to fight corruption.
[2:35:49.460 --> 2:35:54.820]  Well, yeah, I guess that is a parallel journey that a lot of people are taking today.
[2:35:54.820 --> 2:35:56.980]  And so with that in mind, thanks for encouraging me.
[2:35:56.980 --> 2:35:59.180]  I guess the details are perhaps important.
[2:35:59.180 --> 2:36:00.460]  I mean, you're a trailblazer.
[2:36:00.460 --> 2:36:01.460]  Tell us about that.
[2:36:01.460 --> 2:36:07.420]  Well, yeah, that was back in 1960, and I started to give speeches on the United Nations, and
[2:36:07.420 --> 2:36:10.260]  I called it the Fearful Master.
[2:36:10.260 --> 2:36:14.940]  And that was based on the George Washington quote, you know, the government is not reason,
[2:36:14.940 --> 2:36:22.780]  it is not eloquence, it is force, like fire, it is a fearful master and a dangerous servant.
[2:36:22.780 --> 2:36:28.220]  So I used that theme as the title for my speech, and then I decided to write a book, and then
[2:36:28.220 --> 2:36:34.420]  that went from one thing to the other, the first video presentation I did was a film
[2:36:34.420 --> 2:36:39.700]  of another audio, another speech, I should say, that I was giving called The Grand Design.
[2:36:39.700 --> 2:36:45.660]  The Grand Design in those days was the development of U.S. foreign policy, which was to get rid
[2:36:45.660 --> 2:36:54.380]  of U.S. sovereignty to create a true, what they now call, finally, the New World Order.
[2:36:54.380 --> 2:36:59.900]  And in order to do that, they needed to scare the American people with a threat of atomic
[2:36:59.900 --> 2:37:01.500]  holocaust.
[2:37:01.500 --> 2:37:03.260]  That was The Grand Design.
[2:37:03.260 --> 2:37:08.020]  So that was the first video I did, and then from there, it just went on down the line,
[2:37:08.020 --> 2:37:14.020]  I've done things not always having to do with political issues.
[2:37:14.020 --> 2:37:17.780]  One of the major works that I considered to be one of the most important things I ever
[2:37:17.780 --> 2:37:21.540]  did was something in the field of health had to do with cancer.
[2:37:21.540 --> 2:37:27.700]  I wrote a book called World Without Cancer, the story of vitamin B17, which is a natural
[2:37:27.700 --> 2:37:28.700]  control for cancer.
[2:37:28.700 --> 2:37:34.820]  It has nothing to do with drugs or chemotherapy or radiation, and I learned a lot while researching
[2:37:34.820 --> 2:37:36.980]  and pursuing that field.
[2:37:36.980 --> 2:37:42.300]  I did a documentary on the discovery of Noah's Ark, which was more for fun because I've
[2:37:42.300 --> 2:37:46.460]  always had an interest in archaeology and ancient earth history.
[2:37:46.460 --> 2:37:51.820]  But most of my work has been in the field of politics or freedom issues.
[2:37:51.820 --> 2:37:55.380]  In that field, I would say the creature from Jekyll Island is central.
[2:37:55.380 --> 2:37:56.380]  Well, thank you.
[2:37:56.380 --> 2:38:00.580]  The creature from Jekyll Island, of course, is all about the Federal Reserve system.
[2:38:00.580 --> 2:38:06.740]  And frankly, Alex, when I wrote that thing, I really thought I was wasting my time.
[2:38:06.740 --> 2:38:07.740]  It's a big, thick book.
[2:38:07.740 --> 2:38:12.660]  It's 600 in some pages, and I thought nobody wants to read a big book or even a small book,
[2:38:12.660 --> 2:38:15.260]  for that matter, on the subject of the Federal Reserve.
[2:38:15.260 --> 2:38:16.260]  Too dry.
[2:38:16.260 --> 2:38:20.580]  Well, much to my surprise, yeah, a lot of people wanted to read about it, and today
[2:38:20.580 --> 2:38:22.620]  it's in its 20th printing.
[2:38:22.620 --> 2:38:26.980]  And I just got a call from my warehouse manager the other day saying that we have to go for
[2:38:26.980 --> 2:38:28.540]  number 21 now.
[2:38:28.540 --> 2:38:35.540]  So it's amazing, and I think that the economic woes that the nation is facing had a lot to
[2:38:35.540 --> 2:38:40.900]  do with the public becoming more concerned with an issue that ordinarily they would
[2:38:40.900 --> 2:38:42.900]  not think too much about.
[2:38:42.900 --> 2:38:48.460]  I mean, you made so many other films, though, about Katanga and what really happened in
[2:38:48.460 --> 2:38:50.060]  Africa and the U.N. running the slaughter.
[2:38:50.060 --> 2:38:55.140]  I mean, how many films, how many presentations, how many, you know, visual, you know, video
[2:38:55.140 --> 2:38:59.580]  film productions have you made?
[2:38:59.580 --> 2:39:00.580]  Good question.
[2:39:00.580 --> 2:39:04.740]  All together, I'd say there's about 30 or 32 somewhere in that range.
[2:39:04.740 --> 2:39:09.580]  Most of them were video, a few about five or six books.
[2:39:09.580 --> 2:39:11.940]  And a lot of audio, actually.
[2:39:11.940 --> 2:39:13.900]  Audio is really my favorite medium.
[2:39:13.900 --> 2:39:20.860]  I cut my tooth, so to speak, on audio back in the days when we used to carry around these
[2:39:20.860 --> 2:39:25.420]  big Kedolski tape recorders, you know, the naggers, they called them, was used primarily
[2:39:25.420 --> 2:39:29.780]  for film work in Hollywood, and they're very high quality tape recorders.
[2:39:29.780 --> 2:39:34.460]  And I carry two of those around to a lot of lectures and recorded people who were speaking
[2:39:34.460 --> 2:39:37.460]  on various aspects of the freedom movement.
[2:39:37.460 --> 2:39:44.220]  And today, actually, I have probably the world's largest collection of original audio recordings
[2:39:44.220 --> 2:39:45.700]  in that genre.
[2:39:45.700 --> 2:39:50.340]  I knew that I had the second largest one because I used to go around to all of these meetings
[2:39:50.340 --> 2:39:54.980]  recording people, and I'd run into a particular guy, his name was Harry Laney, who also had
[2:39:54.980 --> 2:40:00.660]  another set of naggers, and he was an engineer that worked for IBM, and it was his hobby
[2:40:00.660 --> 2:40:02.060]  to record these things.
[2:40:02.060 --> 2:40:04.980]  He had absolutely the greatest collection.
[2:40:04.980 --> 2:40:08.900]  And then some years later, when he passed away, his widow called me and asked me if
[2:40:08.900 --> 2:40:11.100]  I would like to have his collection.
[2:40:11.100 --> 2:40:13.180]  So now I've got his and mine.
[2:40:13.180 --> 2:40:17.460]  You need to get some volunteers to upload all those to Google, video, or audio and get
[2:40:17.460 --> 2:40:18.460]  them out to people.
[2:40:18.460 --> 2:40:19.460]  I know.
[2:40:19.460 --> 2:40:20.460]  I have, I mean, thousands of them.
[2:40:20.460 --> 2:40:23.500]  You could probably put together like a 20 CD set, too.
[2:40:23.500 --> 2:40:25.940]  A 2000 CD set.
[2:40:25.940 --> 2:40:26.940]  I've already converted.
[2:40:26.940 --> 2:40:27.940]  You make them data CDs, though.
[2:40:27.940 --> 2:40:28.940]  Oh, data CDs.
[2:40:28.940 --> 2:40:30.700]  Yeah, that would be more likely.
[2:40:30.700 --> 2:40:35.540]  I have converted some of them to CDs, we call it the Audio Archives series.
[2:40:35.540 --> 2:40:39.660]  I know you've got a lot of, in fact, a lot of your old films people can still get.
[2:40:39.660 --> 2:40:43.260]  My buddy Chris Athanas bought most of them and aired them on local access TV and really
[2:40:43.260 --> 2:40:44.420]  woke a lot of people up.
[2:40:44.420 --> 2:40:45.420]  Yeah.
[2:40:45.420 --> 2:40:49.220]  Yeah, a lot of old stuff, but most of that material, even though it's old, is very aproposive.
[2:40:49.220 --> 2:40:51.220]  Oh, no, because they just repeat the same thing.
[2:40:51.220 --> 2:40:52.220]  It's a methodology.
[2:40:52.220 --> 2:40:56.300]  Yeah, it becomes even more valuable with age because you can realize with the passage
[2:40:56.300 --> 2:41:01.500]  of time that the issues are repeating and also that the opinions that we're expressing
[2:41:01.500 --> 2:41:02.580]  are valid.
[2:41:02.580 --> 2:41:06.020]  The things that we predicted 20 years ago have come to pass.
[2:41:06.020 --> 2:41:07.540]  Well, that is the proof in the pudding.
[2:41:07.540 --> 2:41:11.540]  I mean, everything you talked about, everything that I've talked about, I mean, we're just
[2:41:11.540 --> 2:41:14.700]  going off their own documents.
[2:41:14.700 --> 2:41:15.700]  It's all developed.
[2:41:15.700 --> 2:41:17.460]  It's all unfolded.
[2:41:17.460 --> 2:41:22.660]  And I think that's why so many people now are waking up because the end game of what
[2:41:22.660 --> 2:41:26.340]  we said the globalist, the new order would do, the controllers, the architects, if they
[2:41:26.340 --> 2:41:30.820]  ever had their way, that they would do A, B, and C, and they're doing A, B, and C. And
[2:41:30.820 --> 2:41:35.180]  I think now how do we capture the attention of all those people and give them goals to
[2:41:35.180 --> 2:41:36.740]  try to attain now?
[2:41:36.740 --> 2:41:42.300]  And how do we get around all the kooks and weirdos that, and I don't try to be a gatekeeper
[2:41:42.300 --> 2:41:43.300]  here.
[2:41:43.300 --> 2:41:46.620]  I don't really try to censor or even cover people I disagree with, but there are a lot
[2:41:46.620 --> 2:41:50.020]  of weirdos that just because there's a vacuum with the mainstream media lying and spinning,
[2:41:50.020 --> 2:41:53.540]  then you have the alternative media with a lot of craziness too.
[2:41:53.540 --> 2:41:55.220]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[2:41:55.220 --> 2:41:58.340]  And that's one of the things that I deal with daily.
[2:41:58.340 --> 2:42:02.380]  We have a weekly new service we put out called Unfiltered News.
[2:42:02.380 --> 2:42:06.060]  And of course, people send me all this stuff and they get upset once in a while because
[2:42:06.060 --> 2:42:07.620]  I don't push it through.
[2:42:07.620 --> 2:42:11.540]  But I recognize having been at this game for so many years that a lot of this stuff is
[2:42:11.540 --> 2:42:12.540]  just nonsense.
[2:42:12.540 --> 2:42:13.540]  It's garbage.
[2:42:13.540 --> 2:42:14.540]  Well, also, that'll be something divisive.
[2:42:14.540 --> 2:42:17.900]  Like, you've got to say it's all the Jews and they secretly drink blood and they work
[2:42:17.900 --> 2:42:23.060]  for the Vatican and they're under control of reptoids.
[2:42:23.060 --> 2:42:25.460]  And I'm just here saying, hey, I want to fight the globalist system.
[2:42:25.460 --> 2:42:30.060]  If we get into arguing about who controls it all day, I mean, I do cover that sum, then
[2:42:30.060 --> 2:42:34.140]  I mean, that gets into clicks and Balkanization instead of a message of more liberty, more
[2:42:34.140 --> 2:42:36.420]  freedom, UN bad, global government bad.
[2:42:36.420 --> 2:42:37.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:42:37.420 --> 2:42:41.780]  I'm so glad to hear you say that, Alex, because that is a pitfall that's I think deliberately
[2:42:41.780 --> 2:42:43.700]  put out there by our enemies.
[2:42:43.700 --> 2:42:45.940]  They want us to step into those traps.
[2:42:45.940 --> 2:42:47.820]  And yeah, we can't do that.
[2:42:47.820 --> 2:42:52.100]  But you know, in this business of predicting what's coming in the future, two days after
[2:42:52.100 --> 2:42:56.980]  9-11, I sat down like a lot of people did and wrote something out.
[2:42:56.980 --> 2:43:00.540]  You know, we were speaking from passion, speaking from emotion.
[2:43:00.540 --> 2:43:02.140]  The event was so overpowering.
[2:43:02.140 --> 2:43:07.060]  A lot of us just wanted to put something in writing to capture our thoughts and our feelings.
[2:43:07.060 --> 2:43:13.300]  Well, that particular day, I started a writing session that was to go on for a couple of
[2:43:13.300 --> 2:43:14.300]  months.
[2:43:14.300 --> 2:43:21.460]  And on the end of the third day, I had written something called predictions from 9-11.
[2:43:21.460 --> 2:43:24.620]  And I had made 13 predictions.
[2:43:24.620 --> 2:43:26.780]  And I kind of went out on the limb.
[2:43:26.780 --> 2:43:30.420]  And I didn't know whether I should publish these or not.
[2:43:30.420 --> 2:43:32.620]  And I decided to publish them.
[2:43:32.620 --> 2:43:37.700]  And I'm unhappy to say that every one of those predictions has come to pass.
[2:43:37.700 --> 2:43:38.700]  That's what I always say.
[2:43:38.700 --> 2:43:43.660]  Unfortunately, we've been right, and nine times out of 10, it actually is worse than
[2:43:43.660 --> 2:43:44.860]  what we originally shared.
[2:43:44.860 --> 2:43:46.660]  Go over some of those 13 and what's happened.
[2:43:46.660 --> 2:43:52.060]  Well, anybody that studied the world events could make most of those predictions.
[2:43:52.060 --> 2:43:57.000]  I talked about the fact that they would soon discover that the FBI and the intelligence
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:03.180]  agencies of the federal government had advanced knowledge of this attack, but did nothing
[2:44:03.180 --> 2:44:04.180]  to stop it.
[2:44:04.180 --> 2:44:05.660]  I made that prediction.
[2:44:05.660 --> 2:44:09.700]  I made the prediction that one that really went furthest out on the limb was that they
[2:44:09.700 --> 2:44:16.340]  would take a long, long time to find Osama bin Laden.
[2:44:16.340 --> 2:44:20.300]  Even though at the moment, they were all, we're not going to stop searching the world
[2:44:20.300 --> 2:44:24.460]  until we find Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice for these crimes.
[2:44:24.460 --> 2:44:27.260]  And you knew that because you knew they needed a boogeyman, and you'd seen him with this
[2:44:27.260 --> 2:44:28.260]  time and time again.
[2:44:28.260 --> 2:44:29.900]  I knew that they needed the boogeyman.
[2:44:29.900 --> 2:44:37.500]  They needed Osama bin Laden as some kind of a figure, a symbol of the enemy that the
[2:44:37.500 --> 2:44:40.340]  American people could look at and say, we hate this man.
[2:44:40.340 --> 2:44:41.340]  We hate this man.
[2:44:41.340 --> 2:44:44.860]  There was a ploy that's been used so many times before in history.
[2:44:44.860 --> 2:44:46.380]  So that's the kind of thing, Alex.
[2:44:46.380 --> 2:44:49.580]  You could, you know, people look at me today and they say, how did you know all these things
[2:44:49.580 --> 2:44:50.780]  were going to happen?
[2:44:50.780 --> 2:44:54.660]  And I have to say in all humility, it's, you don't have to be a rocket scientist.
[2:44:54.660 --> 2:44:58.340]  All you have to do is just see how these, these elitists are running the show.
[2:44:58.340 --> 2:44:59.840]  They're pathological.
[2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:00.840]  They're obsessive compulsive.
[2:45:00.840 --> 2:45:03.980]  In fact, when you read about Prince Charles or Prince Philip or the Queen of England or
[2:45:03.980 --> 2:45:08.540]  the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, it's, it's almost like they are predatory psychopathic
[2:45:08.540 --> 2:45:10.980]  types, control freak, sadistic types.
[2:45:10.980 --> 2:45:13.900]  And they're also, if you read about them, they're obsessed with everything being just
[2:45:13.900 --> 2:45:18.340]  right at, you know, every light bulb not being burned out, every yard being cut just perfect.
[2:45:18.340 --> 2:45:23.340]  I mean, they're really neurotic and they, they, it seems to be a type, you know, a psychological
[2:45:23.340 --> 2:45:24.340]  type.
[2:45:24.340 --> 2:45:27.740]  Of course there's variants there, but it, but it seems that we've got their MO and
[2:45:27.740 --> 2:45:32.180]  they just repeat things with this methodology, this formula over and over again.
[2:45:32.180 --> 2:45:33.180]  Can you speak to that?
[2:45:33.180 --> 2:45:38.100]  Well, yeah, all I can say basically as I agree totally, first thing to observe, I, I believe
[2:45:38.100 --> 2:45:42.340]  about this is that the, the ones who are making the decisions, that's not everybody in the
[2:45:42.340 --> 2:45:46.580]  organization structure, but the ones at the very top are very smart people.
[2:45:46.580 --> 2:45:51.100]  There's, they're intellectuals, they're well read, they're, they're well versed in history
[2:45:51.100 --> 2:45:57.220]  and they, they're philosophers and they have an ideology that they have thought through.
[2:45:57.220 --> 2:46:00.060]  They're completely aligned with it.
[2:46:00.060 --> 2:46:01.660]  They have allegiance to it.
[2:46:01.660 --> 2:46:07.340]  Once you understand what their ideology is and what their goals are, then that's when
[2:46:07.340 --> 2:46:11.660]  you begin to predict what they're going to do and what they're going to say because like
[2:46:11.660 --> 2:46:17.300]  an actor, you can put your own mind into that, into that set and that part, that part.
[2:46:17.300 --> 2:46:20.700]  What would I do if I believed that?
[2:46:20.700 --> 2:46:22.220]  Let me ask you this question then.
[2:46:22.220 --> 2:46:27.740]  I mean, I mean, to boil down in a simple fashion, they're, they're ideology, it's, in justifies
[2:46:27.740 --> 2:46:30.780]  the means, you're always going to have an elite.
[2:46:30.780 --> 2:46:32.900]  We are an enlightened elite as their view.
[2:46:32.900 --> 2:46:35.540]  Yes, we want to exterminate the majority of the population.
[2:46:35.540 --> 2:46:40.900]  Yes, we're for eugenics, but that's survival of the fittest, that social Darwinism.
[2:46:40.900 --> 2:46:43.300]  If we don't do it, somebody else will do it.
[2:46:43.300 --> 2:46:46.660]  And so yes, we stage terror attacks, but it's for the greater good to get these Muslims
[2:46:46.660 --> 2:46:47.940]  under control.
[2:46:47.940 --> 2:46:52.620]  And yes, we do, you know, put cancer viruses in a lot of the vaccines to get rid of people
[2:46:52.620 --> 2:46:54.260]  when there's, you know, 65.
[2:46:54.260 --> 2:46:59.900]  So we don't have to pay for their retirement and you know, Logan's run and yes, we do,
[2:46:59.900 --> 2:47:03.260]  you know, militarize the police and we do bring the drugs in, but if the lower class is dumb
[2:47:03.260 --> 2:47:05.660]  enough to use them, we're going to put them in prison.
[2:47:05.660 --> 2:47:07.820]  You know, this is slavery has always been the way it is.
[2:47:07.820 --> 2:47:10.020]  And we've got to take care of ourselves.
[2:47:10.020 --> 2:47:13.380]  And they get into a power position too, where they always are being threatened by their
[2:47:13.380 --> 2:47:15.860]  own systems, their own competing elites.
[2:47:15.860 --> 2:47:19.180]  And so it's a synthesis of evil.
[2:47:19.180 --> 2:47:25.140]  Or even if you get somewhat, you know, friendly or the, you know, the benevolent dictator,
[2:47:25.140 --> 2:47:30.420]  they always get removed and the centralized pyramidal power structure allows an elitist
[2:47:30.420 --> 2:47:33.380]  or gaggle of elitist who are the most ruthless.
[2:47:33.380 --> 2:47:38.580]  It's kind of a survival of the most ruthless get into those penultimate positions of power.
[2:47:38.580 --> 2:47:44.660]  So by a process of elimination through a type of hyper social Darwinism, you do get the
[2:47:44.660 --> 2:47:50.580]  most psychopathic intelligent cunning groups, then power tends to amass in more centralized
[2:47:50.580 --> 2:47:55.500]  hands, then they become inbred, decadent and insane, but then psychopathic intelligent
[2:47:55.500 --> 2:48:01.700]  bureaucracies grow up around them to defend them and protect them as the institutions themselves
[2:48:01.700 --> 2:48:02.700]  grow.
[2:48:02.700 --> 2:48:08.420]  And now it's almost a machine that is self replicating and is just continuing and operating
[2:48:08.420 --> 2:48:09.420]  on its own.
[2:48:09.420 --> 2:48:13.940]  And the very elites that created it, the, the very technocracy they've built is almost
[2:48:13.940 --> 2:48:17.740]  like a moss growing on the back of a blue whale or something.
[2:48:17.740 --> 2:48:20.940]  And they're just travelers on this thing they've created.
[2:48:20.940 --> 2:48:21.940]  Do you agree with that?
[2:48:21.940 --> 2:48:27.060]  Well, you said it so well, uh, I can't think of any way to summarize it any better than
[2:48:27.060 --> 2:48:28.060]  what you just did.
[2:48:28.060 --> 2:48:29.940]  Well, uh, you can't, I want you to elaborate on that.
[2:48:29.940 --> 2:48:31.420]  Well, I mean, what's their philosophy?
[2:48:31.420 --> 2:48:32.820]  You've been around longer.
[2:48:32.820 --> 2:48:33.820]  You've fought them.
[2:48:33.820 --> 2:48:34.820]  You've confronted them.
[2:48:34.820 --> 2:48:35.820]  You've talked to them.
[2:48:35.820 --> 2:48:36.820]  I mean, what's their main system?
[2:48:36.820 --> 2:48:41.860]  Well, the one aspect of the many things you covered that really stuck in my mind is the
[2:48:41.860 --> 2:48:48.020]  truth that in the beginning there's always some kind of an high ideal that drives these
[2:48:48.020 --> 2:48:49.540]  men and these women.
[2:48:49.540 --> 2:48:53.140]  They're always going to do something for, and here's the key phrase for the greater
[2:48:53.140 --> 2:48:55.220]  good of the greater number.
[2:48:55.220 --> 2:48:59.860]  And that you're going to, you're going to find that element, uh, behind all of the different
[2:48:59.860 --> 2:49:02.340]  variants of collectivism.
[2:49:02.340 --> 2:49:07.180]  And I think when we're talking about something like this, we have to recognize the common
[2:49:07.180 --> 2:49:14.420]  denominator of all of these, these ideologies of communism, fascism, Nazism, socialism,
[2:49:14.420 --> 2:49:19.180]  all of these things that we know historically have proven to be, uh, horrible conditions
[2:49:19.180 --> 2:49:21.500]  under which, or systems under which to live.
[2:49:21.500 --> 2:49:25.900]  The common ideology beneath them all is called collectivism.
[2:49:25.900 --> 2:49:32.980]  And the keynote or the cornerstone, I should say, of collectivism is this thought that
[2:49:32.980 --> 2:49:39.860]  the individual must be sacrificed if necessary for the greater good of the greater number.
[2:49:39.860 --> 2:49:42.940]  And so that is the ether in which this system survives.
[2:49:42.940 --> 2:49:45.460]  That is the fertilizer, the ether, whatever it is.
[2:49:45.460 --> 2:49:49.780]  And it always starts off with this justification, well, it's too bad we have to sacrifice this
[2:49:49.780 --> 2:49:56.580]  person or that minority or those 3,000 people or those 2 million people, whatever it is,
[2:49:56.580 --> 2:50:02.420]  as long as the number being sacrificed is smaller than the number supposedly being benefited,
[2:50:02.420 --> 2:50:06.940]  then they can claim the mantle of being benevolent, that they're really helping society.
[2:50:06.940 --> 2:50:10.180]  As did that go back to the military ideal of, I'm going to put 100 troops out there
[2:50:10.180 --> 2:50:13.860]  to draw on the enemy, that 100 is going to get killed, but then we're going to win the
[2:50:13.860 --> 2:50:16.020]  battle and that will save more of our troops in the end.
[2:50:16.020 --> 2:50:18.460]  That is exactly the philosophy we're talking about.
[2:50:18.460 --> 2:50:21.780]  And there is some justification for it on the battlefield, of course.
[2:50:21.780 --> 2:50:26.380]  But when it comes to building a whole political and social system on that principle, you've
[2:50:26.380 --> 2:50:29.260]  got some real issues involving human rights.
[2:50:29.260 --> 2:50:33.580]  Then you get a bunch of inbred elites on power trips nihilistically running around building
[2:50:33.580 --> 2:50:35.060]  anti-matter weapons.
[2:50:35.060 --> 2:50:39.460]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest, we'll tell you about his websites, organizations, and
[2:50:39.460 --> 2:50:40.700]  a lot more after this quick break.
[2:50:40.700 --> 2:50:41.700]  This is amazing.
[2:50:41.700 --> 2:50:44.460]  I may just go on to overdrive the day so we can play the horror wits video.
[2:50:44.460 --> 2:50:47.380]  We might just go to 3 with Mr. Griffin if he can do that, and we'll take some calls
[2:50:47.380 --> 2:50:48.380]  coming up in the next hour.
[2:50:48.380 --> 2:50:49.380]  Stay with me.
[2:50:49.380 --> 2:51:04.140]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:51:04.140 --> 2:51:07.300]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:51:07.300 --> 2:51:12.300]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[2:51:12.300 --> 2:51:20.780]  80% of humanity is at hand, for the first time in history, the elites' plan for world
[2:51:20.780 --> 2:51:22.660]  government is blown wide open.
[2:51:22.660 --> 2:51:26.380]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:51:26.380 --> 2:51:29.660]  They'll very much make great progress toward a world government.
[2:51:29.660 --> 2:51:30.660]  Most people have no idea.
[2:51:30.660 --> 2:51:31.660]  They're not after money.
[2:51:31.660 --> 2:51:32.660]  They have all the money they need.
[2:51:32.660 --> 2:51:33.660]  They're after power.
[2:51:33.660 --> 2:51:34.660]  Yes, they're after easier.

[2:52:47.940 --> 2:52:52.500]  Hi, this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[2:52:52.500 --> 2:52:56.460]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at
[2:52:56.460 --> 2:52:57.460]  the pump.
[2:52:57.460 --> 2:53:01.500]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas
[2:53:01.500 --> 2:53:02.500]  mileage.
[2:53:02.500 --> 2:53:06.860]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a
[2:53:06.860 --> 2:53:12.500]  complete fuel system treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage
[2:53:12.500 --> 2:53:14.060]  and only one tank full.
[2:53:14.060 --> 2:53:18.620]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction but it extends the life of your engine.
[2:53:18.620 --> 2:53:22.540]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline it's time to take action.
[2:53:22.540 --> 2:53:27.620]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment
[2:53:27.620 --> 2:53:30.380]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[2:53:30.380 --> 2:53:32.620]  Call 8888 use SFR 1.
[2:53:32.620 --> 2:53:39.860]  That number again is 8888 use SFR 1 or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com.
[2:53:39.860 --> 2:53:41.900]  That's OilCompanySecret.com.
[2:53:41.900 --> 2:53:46.220]  Satisfaction is guaranteed for your money back and it's safe for all cars.
[2:53:46.220 --> 2:53:47.220]  Act now.
[2:53:47.220 --> 2:53:59.900]  If you live in central Texas, you'll be able to hop in your car or ride with your friends
[2:53:59.900 --> 2:54:04.380]  carpool down at the University of Texas, plenty of parking in the surrounding area.
[2:54:04.380 --> 2:54:11.900]  At night, UT campus 8 p.m. to 9.45 p.m., not plenty of parking during the day, UT campus
[2:54:11.900 --> 2:54:17.980]  8 p.m. to 9.45 p.m., gesture dorm room A 121A.
[2:54:17.980 --> 2:54:23.620]  So just the gesture dorm and it's a big room, I think it holds like 400 people, maybe more.
[2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:30.700]  Room A 121A and it's the 21st Street and Speedway.
[2:54:30.700 --> 2:54:37.700]  The message is the Quigley formula and the mission of Freedom Force International.
[2:54:37.700 --> 2:54:45.500]  More info at the event and parking is at PNAC, PNACitizen.org, PNACitizen.org, book signing
[2:54:45.500 --> 2:54:46.860]  and brave new books afterwards.
[2:54:46.860 --> 2:54:50.820]  I would imagine what at 10 o'clock at night because it's at 8 p.m. to 9.45 and 15 minutes
[2:54:50.820 --> 2:54:56.700]  later after a break across the street, it's about a block away there at brave new books
[2:54:56.700 --> 2:54:59.580]  right there on the end of Guadalupe at the end of the drag, right at the start of the
[2:54:59.580 --> 2:55:00.580]  drag.
[2:55:00.580 --> 2:55:05.140]  UT campus 8 p.m. to 9.45 p.m., gesture dorm room A 121A.
[2:55:05.140 --> 2:55:07.980]  Now I would love to go see this, people always ask why don't I come out to events.
[2:55:07.980 --> 2:55:13.340]  I'm going to be on BBC 5 for a debate tonight, maybe for a whole hour, they're saying for
[2:55:13.340 --> 2:55:16.100]  at least half the hour, that means it's going to be a real attack piece when it won't tell
[2:55:16.100 --> 2:55:17.740]  you how long you're on.
[2:55:17.740 --> 2:55:20.980]  And then for three hours, I'm going to be on Raleigh James nationwide tonight at that
[2:55:20.980 --> 2:55:23.620]  time, so I can't be there, but believe me, I wish I would be there.
[2:55:23.620 --> 2:55:28.660]  I'd love to go to these events, but I hope you will go to this event tonight, room A
[2:55:28.660 --> 2:55:29.660]  121A.
[2:55:29.660 --> 2:55:32.780]  People think I'm not being friendly, that I don't ever go to these events, I just can't
[2:55:32.780 --> 2:55:34.700]  because I'm tied down in the fight.
[2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:38.620]  Do you ever, Gia Bergriffin, do you ever get frustrated because you've been a prolific
[2:55:38.620 --> 2:55:42.500]  creative guy, you're doing more now than ever, that there's just so much you want to do,
[2:55:42.500 --> 2:55:46.540]  so many people you want to warn, so many facts you've got, but then you've got so much info
[2:55:46.540 --> 2:55:51.140]  that it's just there's not enough time in the day to do it all.
[2:55:51.140 --> 2:55:52.340]  Do I ever get that way?
[2:55:52.340 --> 2:55:59.100]  I'm constantly that way, but I decided some years ago that I had to put a lid on it because
[2:55:59.100 --> 2:56:04.180]  otherwise I'd be so filled with anxiety and frustration, I wouldn't be able to think straight.
[2:56:04.180 --> 2:56:05.180]  That's me.
[2:56:05.180 --> 2:56:11.060]  Yeah, well, I didn't say that, but that's the way it was when I was your age, actually.
[2:56:11.060 --> 2:56:15.580]  And then I realized it was getting to my health, and so I kind of backed off a little bit,
[2:56:15.580 --> 2:56:19.580]  and people say, oh, you're so calm now, nothing seems to bother you.
[2:56:19.580 --> 2:56:22.540]  They have no idea what fire is raging inside.
[2:56:22.540 --> 2:56:26.740]  Yeah, constant frustration and anxiety about what's going on in the world.
[2:56:26.740 --> 2:56:30.220]  But somewhere along the line, you know, as you mature, you think, well, okay, you've
[2:56:30.220 --> 2:56:35.140]  got to survive all of this, you've got to live, so cool down and take it one step at
[2:56:35.140 --> 2:56:36.140]  a time.
[2:56:36.140 --> 2:56:37.140]  That's what I try and do.
[2:56:37.140 --> 2:56:38.140]  Absolutely.
[2:56:38.140 --> 2:56:42.260]  We're going to break and start the fourth hour here in a moment, and I asked you what
[2:56:42.260 --> 2:56:45.860]  you wanted to talk about in the last segment for PrismPlanet.tv, viewers and people listening
[2:56:45.860 --> 2:56:48.860]  to my streams on the Internet Info, where they had a chance to hear that behind the
[2:56:48.860 --> 2:56:49.860]  scenes discussion.
[2:56:49.860 --> 2:56:52.700]  People can go to those streams if they want to hear, some of those will be having next
[2:56:52.700 --> 2:56:56.780]  hour, so we can use as much as the hour as we can.
[2:56:56.780 --> 2:57:03.620]  But I want to go over what you wanted to discuss, the economy, the election, and then solutions.
[2:57:03.620 --> 2:57:06.820]  And so we'll spend the whole hour on that, maybe take a few calls, but we've got about
[2:57:06.820 --> 2:57:08.220]  a minute left.
[2:57:08.220 --> 2:57:10.060]  Let's start with the economy.
[2:57:10.060 --> 2:57:13.860]  Well, the economy, I think everyone recognizes, is in meltdown.
[2:57:13.860 --> 2:57:18.300]  And why is it in meltdown is the big thing, and what can you do about it?
[2:57:18.300 --> 2:57:24.500]  It's in meltdown because the Federal Reserve system under the watchful eye of the Federal
[2:57:24.500 --> 2:57:29.380]  government has pumped too much money into the system.
[2:57:29.380 --> 2:57:33.700]  They spent too much, they didn't want to raise taxes in order to pay for what they're spending,
[2:57:33.700 --> 2:57:38.260]  and so they decided to take it from the taxpayers in the form of inflation.
[2:57:38.260 --> 2:57:40.820]  That's in a 30-second summary, that's what's going on.
[2:57:40.820 --> 2:57:46.060]  Do you think they've done this by design, A, is it a unified banking camp, that's a sub
[2:57:46.060 --> 2:57:50.700]  of A, and then B, how bad will it get?
[2:57:50.700 --> 2:57:55.020]  I think it is by design on the part of the people that make the decisions.
[2:57:55.020 --> 2:57:58.540]  I think there are a lot of people in middle management, people who are part of the system
[2:57:58.540 --> 2:58:02.660]  without even knowing really what they're doing, that probably would never consciously
[2:58:02.660 --> 2:58:06.180]  design to throw away the American economy.
[2:58:06.180 --> 2:58:08.300]  They're just riding along, it's a great ride.
[2:58:08.300 --> 2:58:13.140]  But at the very top, I think that the people at the Federal Reserve level, for example,
[2:58:13.140 --> 2:58:16.300]  have known all along that that is the end of the line.
[2:58:16.300 --> 2:58:18.580]  And so they have had a plan B, they've had a plan B.
[2:58:18.580 --> 2:58:21.380]  I agree, stay there, stay there, and that's why they're building the camps, gearing up
[2:58:21.380 --> 2:58:23.420]  the police, handing out machine guns.
[2:58:23.420 --> 2:58:26.500]  They know that when they take it all, the yuppies are going to riot, we'll be right
[2:58:26.500 --> 2:58:27.500]  back.

[3:00:00.020 --> 3:00:14.420]  Dr. John Horowitz is going to be popping in for about five minutes today.
[3:00:14.420 --> 3:00:18.100]  Reverend Jeremiah Wright talked about his book about the engineering of age, which we
[3:00:18.100 --> 3:00:21.420]  know is declassified, that and other classes of autoimmune deviruses.
[3:00:21.420 --> 3:00:25.620]  It's kind of a cover for a whole host of things that are very specific.
[3:00:25.620 --> 3:00:26.900]  My dad's a physician.
[3:00:26.900 --> 3:00:28.820]  He talked to medical doctors back in the 80s.
[3:00:28.820 --> 3:00:30.580]  He's like, son, it's a bio weapon.
[3:00:30.580 --> 3:00:34.220]  We all know it's almost impossible for whites to get it unless you've been taking heavy
[3:00:34.220 --> 3:00:37.780]  metal based drugs.
[3:00:37.780 --> 3:00:45.180]  The inside info is that my dad's crazy when I'm a little teenager, and then it all turned
[3:00:45.180 --> 3:00:46.220]  out to be true.
[3:00:46.220 --> 3:00:48.380]  They knew back then it was just knowledge.
[3:00:48.380 --> 3:00:49.660]  My dad wasn't even into this stuff.
[3:00:49.660 --> 3:00:51.340]  I mean, it was just common knowledge.
[3:00:51.340 --> 3:00:55.700]  He's going to pop in for five minutes today, and then he'll be with us for an hour tomorrow.
[3:00:55.700 --> 3:01:01.060]  Geord Griffin is our guest, a continuing sir, continuing with what you were talking
[3:01:01.060 --> 3:01:06.900]  about when I said, is this engineered, or is this happening just because they're such
[3:01:06.900 --> 3:01:08.300]  bad managers?
[3:01:08.300 --> 3:01:15.420]  Well, I think that the people who make the policy decisions at the Federal Reserve level,
[3:01:15.420 --> 3:01:20.900]  okay, and above, by the way, Federal Reserve is, I think your listeners probably know this,
[3:01:20.900 --> 3:01:23.500]  the Federal Reserve is not a government agency.
[3:01:23.500 --> 3:01:28.900]  It's a cartel, it's a banking cartel, and Bernanke and all the people on the Board of
[3:01:28.900 --> 3:01:32.980]  Directors of the Federal Reserve, they're not really at the top of the pinnacle of
[3:01:32.980 --> 3:01:34.980]  this structure.
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:35.980]  They're not the private shareholders.
[3:01:35.980 --> 3:01:37.540]  They're not the private shareholders.
[3:01:37.540 --> 3:01:40.740]  They're not the ones that make the decisions, but they make the minor decisions.
[3:01:40.740 --> 3:01:42.420]  They execute the major ones.
[3:01:42.420 --> 3:01:48.140]  So somebody has told them at the banking level that they want to do whatever is best for
[3:01:48.140 --> 3:01:49.540]  the interest of the banks.
[3:01:49.540 --> 3:01:53.780]  Now, they don't want to kill the golden goose that lays the eggs, so they would like to
[3:01:53.780 --> 3:01:59.580]  see the American economy as prosperous as possible as long as the interests of the banks
[3:01:59.580 --> 3:02:00.860]  come first.
[3:02:00.860 --> 3:02:04.820]  And I've always said that whenever there was a direct conflict between the interests of
[3:02:04.820 --> 3:02:09.220]  the banks and the interests of the nation, you can be sure that the decisions would be
[3:02:09.220 --> 3:02:11.580]  made in favor of the banks.
[3:02:11.580 --> 3:02:16.260]  Now we're beginning to see that unfold where almost anybody can see it.
[3:02:16.260 --> 3:02:20.980]  And so the point of all that is that they have known from the very beginning, back when
[3:02:20.980 --> 3:02:27.460]  this thing was formed in 1913, that somewhere down the line, pushing the interests of the
[3:02:27.460 --> 3:02:31.380]  banks, ahead of the interests of the people, was going to have a consequence.
[3:02:31.380 --> 3:02:35.100]  And that was the consequence of inflating the money supply.
[3:02:35.100 --> 3:02:37.060]  And that would lead to inflation.
[3:02:37.060 --> 3:02:41.780]  That would lead eventually to the destruction of the American Monetary Unit, the Federal
[3:02:41.780 --> 3:02:43.020]  Reserve Note.
[3:02:43.020 --> 3:02:47.740]  And somewhere down the line, they knew that the price would have to be paid for that.
[3:02:47.740 --> 3:02:50.540]  No, that doesn't mean they wanted to see it happen.
[3:02:50.540 --> 3:02:54.580]  That doesn't mean they accelerated it or anything like that, but they have known it was going
[3:02:54.580 --> 3:02:55.580]  to happen.
[3:02:55.580 --> 3:02:58.940]  Well, I mean, even I keep mentioning these articles, but even the Sunday Times of London,
[3:02:58.940 --> 3:03:03.740]  it was neocon, but the Financial Times of London, which is pretty open about what they're
[3:03:03.740 --> 3:03:08.100]  doing, had the headline that big central banks stand to gain from subprime crisis.
[3:03:08.100 --> 3:03:11.860]  And they admit that they're getting all this government money that inflates our money,
[3:03:11.860 --> 3:03:16.260]  but they're getting it for free, and then they're going in and buying up their competition.
[3:03:16.260 --> 3:03:19.900]  So they reduced the regulations in the 90s.
[3:03:19.900 --> 3:03:23.860]  They flooded everything with cheap liquidity, and now they're picking up all the real assets.
[3:03:23.860 --> 3:03:24.860]  Oh, right.
[3:03:24.860 --> 3:03:28.860]  And they're picking it up not with their own money, but with taxpayers' money.
[3:03:28.860 --> 3:03:34.300]  That's the hidden part that people miss, because one of the purposes of the Federal Reserve
[3:03:34.300 --> 3:03:37.580]  and the same thing with the Bank of England and the central banks and the other countries
[3:03:37.580 --> 3:03:42.820]  of the world is to make this partnership between the banks and the government so that when
[3:03:42.820 --> 3:03:48.620]  the banks needed to be bailed out, the government would step in as a partner and use taxpayers'
[3:03:48.620 --> 3:03:53.540]  money to bail out the banks, to bail out their bad investment decisions, and they would
[3:03:53.540 --> 3:03:57.900]  sell it to the people as though this was somehow in the interest of the economy.
[3:03:57.900 --> 3:03:59.260]  This was preserving the economy.
[3:03:59.260 --> 3:04:03.940]  This was protecting the people, and that's what we see unfolding today.
[3:04:03.940 --> 3:04:08.700]  But back to the other thing, which is what they expect to see happen at the end of this
[3:04:08.700 --> 3:04:10.340]  game.
[3:04:10.340 --> 3:04:13.900]  They have known that the economy was going to melt down at some point.
[3:04:13.900 --> 3:04:15.020]  So what are they going to do about it?
[3:04:15.020 --> 3:04:18.540]  Just wait and then see if they can survive the chaos?
[3:04:18.540 --> 3:04:19.540]  No.
[3:04:19.540 --> 3:04:20.940]  These people are too smart for that.
[3:04:20.940 --> 3:04:22.100]  They want to be in control of the inflation.
[3:04:22.100 --> 3:04:24.660]  They want to be in control of the implosion.
[3:04:24.660 --> 3:04:25.660]  Stay there.
[3:04:25.660 --> 3:04:26.660]  Stay there.
[3:04:26.660 --> 3:04:27.660]  We've got a break.
[3:04:27.660 --> 3:04:28.660]  Four listeners listening to the info war streams.
[3:04:28.660 --> 3:04:31.500]  We're going to continue during the break, and we'll be right back on the other side.
[3:04:31.500 --> 3:04:35.420]  We're going to get into the election, the staged elections, Jeopard Griffin's take
[3:04:35.420 --> 3:04:36.420]  on that.
[3:04:36.420 --> 3:04:39.860]  Some of the new books and videos he's got out, as well as his classic Creech from
[3:04:39.860 --> 3:04:42.660]  Jekyll Island, and your phone calls, and a lot of solutions.
[3:04:42.660 --> 3:04:46.460]  Stay with us.
[3:04:46.460 --> 3:04:50.700]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:04:50.700 --> 3:04:55.300]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:04:55.300 --> 3:05:01.260]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[3:05:01.260 --> 3:05:04.420]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:05:04.420 --> 3:05:09.420]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:05:09.420 --> 3:05:14.780]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:05:14.780 --> 3:05:20.220]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:05:20.220 --> 3:05:24.060]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:05:24.060 --> 3:05:26.780]  The Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[3:05:26.780 --> 3:05:27.780]  Most people have no idea.
[3:05:27.780 --> 3:05:28.780]  They're not after money.
[3:05:28.780 --> 3:05:29.780]  They have all the money they need.
[3:05:29.780 --> 3:05:30.780]  They're after power.
[3:05:30.780 --> 3:05:31.780]  They're after affidavit.

[3:05:45.340 --> 3:05:49.800]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[3:05:49.800 --> 3:05:53.900]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth and those crow's feet
[3:05:53.900 --> 3:05:55.420]  over by my eyes.
[3:05:55.420 --> 3:05:59.300]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those
[3:05:59.300 --> 3:06:00.300]  wrinkles.
[3:06:00.300 --> 3:06:02.460]  Then I heard about a product called Tottenall.

[3:06:07.180 --> 3:06:08.860]  appearance of wrinkles.

[3:06:09.860 --> 3:06:11.900]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.

[3:08:13.620 --> 3:08:16.980]  He's got a lot of different websites.
[3:08:16.980 --> 3:08:23.140]  One of them is freedom-force.org, freedom-force.org, and we've got a link at the top of the main
[3:08:23.140 --> 3:08:24.140]  page of info-wars.com.
[3:08:24.140 --> 3:08:27.860]  I'll tell you about some more of his great sites, Filmmaker.
[3:08:27.860 --> 3:08:31.780]  A lot of you woke up to the New World Order because of Gia McGrefflin.
[3:08:31.780 --> 3:08:32.780]  You don't know it.
[3:08:32.780 --> 3:08:37.140]  Some other author, some other person woke you up, but you don't know that he woke them
[3:08:37.140 --> 3:08:38.700]  up.
[3:08:38.700 --> 3:08:42.660]  And that's how these ripples in a pond happen.
[3:08:42.660 --> 3:08:48.700]  And it's the guy that was there 20, 30, 40, I guess now, 48 years ago when you got started.
[3:08:48.700 --> 3:08:49.900]  They're throwing rocks in the pond.
[3:08:49.900 --> 3:08:50.900]  There are very few people.
[3:08:50.900 --> 3:08:55.540]  Before we get back to the economy, then the election, and then real solutions, who are
[3:08:55.540 --> 3:08:56.540]  some of the other icons?
[3:08:56.540 --> 3:08:59.100]  I mean, who do you think of as real icons?
[3:08:59.100 --> 3:09:03.020]  Who else was around when you were doing what you were doing, and who were some mentors
[3:09:03.020 --> 3:09:05.020]  that woke Gia McGrefflin up?
[3:09:05.020 --> 3:09:07.660]  Well, there are two names that come to mind.
[3:09:07.660 --> 3:09:11.580]  One probably nobody ever heard of today, and that was Dan Smoot.
[3:09:11.580 --> 3:09:12.580]  Dan Smoot was a former...
[3:09:12.580 --> 3:09:13.580]  The Smoot Report.
[3:09:13.580 --> 3:09:14.580]  The Smoot Report.
[3:09:14.580 --> 3:09:16.500]  Well, you heard of it then, yes.
[3:09:16.500 --> 3:09:17.500]  Dan Smoot was a little guy.
[3:09:17.500 --> 3:09:22.660]  He used to work for the FBI, and he quit his job because he didn't think that his work
[3:09:22.660 --> 3:09:27.180]  for the FBI was constructive enough, and he became a communicator.
[3:09:27.180 --> 3:09:32.020]  And he put out the Dan Smoot Report, and he had a television program, very similar to
[3:09:32.020 --> 3:09:37.660]  what you're doing here, Alex, except in those days it was all filmed on 16-millimeter film.
[3:09:37.660 --> 3:09:39.900]  It was a place in Texas somewhere.
[3:09:39.900 --> 3:09:47.900]  Anyway, Dan Smoot was one of the great mentors for me, and I remember at one time thinking,
[3:09:47.900 --> 3:09:52.780]  as I was reading Dan Smoot Report, I think, I wish I could write like that, with such
[3:09:52.780 --> 3:09:57.820]  clarity of thought, with no garbage in it, right to the point, and very succinct.
[3:09:57.820 --> 3:09:59.020]  So Dan Smoot.
[3:09:59.020 --> 3:10:02.900]  Another one that is more controversial figure would be Robert Welch.
[3:10:02.900 --> 3:10:04.660]  He was the founder of the John Burt Society.
[3:10:04.660 --> 3:10:05.900]  I don't know why it was controversial.
[3:10:05.900 --> 3:10:08.980]  Well, it was controversial because most people think that he was a kook.
[3:10:08.980 --> 3:10:09.980]  He was a real nut.
[3:10:09.980 --> 3:10:13.780]  Oh, how dare him think that there's big banks financing the communists, which is now all
[3:10:13.780 --> 3:10:14.780]  declassified.
[3:10:14.780 --> 3:10:18.380]  I mean, on History Channel, they admit the CIA put Mao in now.
[3:10:18.380 --> 3:10:19.380]  Yeah.
[3:10:19.380 --> 3:10:24.940]  Well, back in the 60s and 70s, of course, Robert Welch was really anathema as far as
[3:10:24.940 --> 3:10:26.300]  the media is concerned.
[3:10:26.300 --> 3:10:29.660]  And my friends and neighbors all thought that I was crazy for even associating with the
[3:10:29.660 --> 3:10:31.860]  guy because they thought he was a kook.
[3:10:31.860 --> 3:10:32.860]  They thought he was...
[3:10:32.860 --> 3:10:38.620]  They weren't sure whether he was a fascist or a communist or what, an anti-Semite or
[3:10:38.620 --> 3:10:39.620]  a racist.
[3:10:39.620 --> 3:10:40.620]  They had all these words floating around.
[3:10:40.620 --> 3:10:41.620]  He was none of the above.
[3:10:41.620 --> 3:10:48.700]  He was a very intellectual person and a historian, and he had a profound impact on awaking me
[3:10:48.700 --> 3:10:54.140]  to awareness of the continuity between what is going on today and what has been going
[3:10:54.140 --> 3:10:56.540]  on throughout history.
[3:10:56.540 --> 3:11:01.380]  And without that continuity, it's really hard to understand fully the essence of what's
[3:11:01.380 --> 3:11:02.380]  going on.
[3:11:02.380 --> 3:11:05.060]  Those are the two figures that had a profound effect on me.
[3:11:05.060 --> 3:11:09.780]  I like your analysis, though, because we all are just like pebbles in a pond.
[3:11:09.780 --> 3:11:13.420]  And if we can attract somebody's attention to the pond, and then they start throwing
[3:11:13.420 --> 3:11:17.420]  pebbles in, first thing you know, you've got more and more in big waves.
[3:11:17.420 --> 3:11:23.140]  Or we could be a bomb with a uranium bullet, a plutonium bullet being fired into the uranium,
[3:11:23.140 --> 3:11:27.020]  and then you have that interaction, and it's going critical right now.
[3:11:27.020 --> 3:11:33.420]  I mean, I want to get more into the economy, but do you agree that this is the biggest
[3:11:33.420 --> 3:11:36.420]  critical growth of awakening from the matrix to liberty?
[3:11:36.420 --> 3:11:38.260]  I mean, it's just explosive.
[3:11:38.260 --> 3:11:39.500]  It's just unbelievable, right?
[3:11:39.500 --> 3:11:41.020]  Alex, there's no question about it.
[3:11:41.020 --> 3:11:46.140]  This is approaching critical mass, and that pulls my mind back to a topic we were on
[3:11:46.140 --> 3:11:52.300]  track with a moment ago, which is what these guys are anticipating to happen down at the
[3:11:52.300 --> 3:11:53.300]  end of the line.
[3:11:53.300 --> 3:11:55.620]  And we were talking about the economy at that time.
[3:11:55.620 --> 3:11:56.620]  So let me address that quickly.
[3:11:56.620 --> 3:11:57.940]  Well, let's finish up with the economy.
[3:11:57.940 --> 3:12:02.220]  Yeah, because what they expect to see is a collapse of the U.S. dollar.
[3:12:02.220 --> 3:12:04.980]  They've been expecting that for decades.
[3:12:04.980 --> 3:12:10.660]  And so right now, they have unleashed Plan B, which is, you see, their long-range goal
[3:12:10.660 --> 3:12:14.620]  is to get rid of the sovereignty of this nation, to literally get rid of the United
[3:12:14.620 --> 3:12:15.620]  States.
[3:12:15.620 --> 3:12:18.580]  And by the way, the trilaterals in the 70s said they would first have, you know, three
[3:12:18.580 --> 3:12:20.220]  global currencies that merge those.
[3:12:20.220 --> 3:12:21.220]  Yeah.
[3:12:21.220 --> 3:12:23.660]  So this is not a last-minute plan.
[3:12:23.660 --> 3:12:28.340]  And so now that the dollar is tanking, they're prepared to come on in the near future and
[3:12:28.340 --> 3:12:31.460]  say, aha, we have a solution for you, folks.
[3:12:31.460 --> 3:12:32.820]  It'll be called the Amaro.
[3:12:32.820 --> 3:12:34.580]  It'll be a new currency.
[3:12:34.580 --> 3:12:39.140]  Dollar rise, the Americas, and together that'll get our credit back up, and then things can
[3:12:39.140 --> 3:12:40.140]  start moving.
[3:12:40.140 --> 3:12:43.300]  And then as soon as we accept that, then they turn the credit back on, and we think, oh,
[3:12:43.300 --> 3:12:44.300]  they fixed it.
[3:12:44.300 --> 3:12:45.300]  They fixed it, yeah.
[3:12:45.300 --> 3:12:50.820]  So that will be a huge step to surrender our national sovereignty so they will gain toward
[3:12:50.820 --> 3:12:52.140]  their ultimate goal.
[3:12:52.140 --> 3:12:57.340]  And we, if we're not careful, will be sold to bill of goods and be convinced that we've
[3:12:57.340 --> 3:12:59.100]  done a wonderful thing.
[3:12:59.100 --> 3:13:00.220]  So that's the answer.
[3:13:00.220 --> 3:13:03.980]  And they do have a plan for everything, and that's not the end of the line either.
[3:13:03.980 --> 3:13:08.820]  Once the Amaro or the regional currency is in place, then I would guess another 10, 15,
[3:13:08.820 --> 3:13:12.900]  20 years perhaps, then finally they get rid of all of the regional currencies and merge
[3:13:12.900 --> 3:13:15.860]  them into a true international currency.
[3:13:15.860 --> 3:13:17.940]  And again, the process will be the same.
[3:13:17.940 --> 3:13:21.940]  The citizens of the world will be convinced that it was a step forward in their own best
[3:13:21.940 --> 3:13:22.940]  interest.
[3:13:22.940 --> 3:13:26.380]  Now, the average person doesn't think of an institutional or long-term view.
[3:13:26.380 --> 3:13:27.620]  They don't even care about their neighbor.
[3:13:27.620 --> 3:13:28.620]  They've been taught to.
[3:13:28.620 --> 3:13:29.980]  They don't care about their kids, a lot of them.
[3:13:29.980 --> 3:13:34.100]  Or they consciously do, but really don't carry that out.
[3:13:34.100 --> 3:13:36.740]  And so they think, well, how could something last that long?
[3:13:36.740 --> 3:13:39.380]  Why would they work for someone that came in the future?
[3:13:39.380 --> 3:13:41.500]  It's institutional family wealth.
[3:13:41.500 --> 3:13:45.460]  They sit over the institutions that give them personal wealth and power.
[3:13:45.460 --> 3:13:50.380]  It's in their best interest to always be expanding that power and control.
[3:13:50.380 --> 3:13:56.500]  It's part of a greater work that they're building, kind of like the guy that's sculpting one of
[3:13:56.500 --> 3:14:00.300]  the great Indian chiefs in the mountains, probably take two more generations to do it.
[3:14:00.300 --> 3:14:04.820]  That's how universities, that's how organizations, that's how things continue.
[3:14:04.820 --> 3:14:06.740]  And they've stated all of this.
[3:14:06.740 --> 3:14:07.980]  They own the currencies now.
[3:14:07.980 --> 3:14:09.420]  They get power and control.
[3:14:09.420 --> 3:14:13.300]  It's just they're going to another phase where they've got total global control because
[3:14:13.300 --> 3:14:18.660]  there's still cracks in the facade where people can still escape or still black markets.
[3:14:18.660 --> 3:14:26.020]  This is a total scientific dictatorship, the total managed economy, the final revolution,
[3:14:26.020 --> 3:14:28.940]  the monopoly of power that they're going for.
[3:14:28.940 --> 3:14:30.620]  Can you break that down for people?
[3:14:30.620 --> 3:14:33.900]  Well, yes, again, you've said it so well, Alex.
[3:14:33.900 --> 3:14:38.700]  But my own take on it is that this process of collectivism, that's what we're talking
[3:14:38.700 --> 3:14:43.740]  about, this concentration of governmental and political and economic power in the hands
[3:14:43.740 --> 3:14:49.340]  of a few who are making the decision supposedly in the name of the greater number is for your
[3:14:49.340 --> 3:14:54.300]  own good, for the good of society, is heady wine.
[3:14:54.300 --> 3:14:56.900]  And that's the wrong analogy, it's like a pregnancy.
[3:14:56.900 --> 3:14:59.740]  Once it starts, it's got to go to full term.
[3:14:59.740 --> 3:15:05.820]  There's no case in history that a group of men who have pulled power over their fellow
[3:15:05.820 --> 3:15:10.460]  human beings pulled it together that they've ever stopped and said, well, this is enough.
[3:15:10.460 --> 3:15:11.460]  It's never happened.
[3:15:11.460 --> 3:15:13.660]  They always want more, more and more.
[3:15:13.660 --> 3:15:17.060]  And so isn't this a guild of the ultimate control freaks?
[3:15:17.060 --> 3:15:18.300]  It is a guild.
[3:15:18.300 --> 3:15:23.380]  And the interesting thing is that they will vie with each other over control of that guild.
[3:15:23.380 --> 3:15:27.020]  So we have splinters within this movement today.
[3:15:27.020 --> 3:15:28.020]  Very important splinter.
[3:15:28.020 --> 3:15:29.020]  But it's like Russian dolls.
[3:15:29.020 --> 3:15:30.020]  It's within the greater structure.
[3:15:30.020 --> 3:15:31.020]  Yes, yes.
[3:15:31.020 --> 3:15:34.580]  But they will fight with each other for dominance and maybe we can come back to that.
[3:15:34.580 --> 3:15:38.260]  And they even talk about that and say, that's what gives them vigor, kind of like O'Brien
[3:15:38.260 --> 3:15:39.260]  torturing Winston.
[3:15:39.260 --> 3:15:40.900]  He says, they're probably going to kill me, too.
[3:15:40.900 --> 3:15:44.100]  But that's good because you think I have black circles around my eyes.
[3:15:44.100 --> 3:15:49.220]  Well, you know, my, you know, unhealth, me being worn out as part of the greater health
[3:15:49.220 --> 3:15:50.220]  of the vigor.
[3:15:50.220 --> 3:15:51.220]  We're the priests of power.
[3:15:51.220 --> 3:15:52.980]  It's about pressing on the nerve, Winston.
[3:15:52.980 --> 3:15:57.420]  There's always more, more tearing humans apart, tearing language, tearing art, reducing
[3:15:57.420 --> 3:15:58.420]  it for power.
[3:15:58.420 --> 3:15:59.420]  Yes.
[3:15:59.420 --> 3:16:01.420]  My gosh, that's a well said.
[3:16:01.420 --> 3:16:03.980]  Well, I mean, that's Eric Blair wrote this one.
[3:16:03.980 --> 3:16:04.980]  Yeah, I know.
[3:16:04.980 --> 3:16:05.980]  And it's so true.
[3:16:05.980 --> 3:16:10.060]  Yeah, it's power for its own sake and takes on a life force of its own.
[3:16:10.060 --> 3:16:17.060]  And the point being that as I see it, that this process has never stopped short of total
[3:16:17.060 --> 3:16:18.060]  once it starts.
[3:16:18.060 --> 3:16:21.260]  So do we learn anything from that?
[3:16:21.260 --> 3:16:22.260]  The question is yes.
[3:16:22.260 --> 3:16:26.700]  I think we can learn that the process that we're dealing with now has is not going to
[3:16:26.700 --> 3:16:28.820]  stop of its own accord.
[3:16:28.820 --> 3:16:32.700]  If we just sit back and say, well, maybe these people are going to come to their senses,
[3:16:32.700 --> 3:16:37.180]  or maybe if we write a letter to our congressman, or maybe if we sign a petition asking that
[3:16:37.180 --> 3:16:40.620]  they obey the Constitution, maybe we can stop this power.
[3:16:40.620 --> 3:16:45.460]  No, we've got to confront that power with equal or greater power.
[3:16:45.460 --> 3:16:48.260]  This is the part that many people do not want to face.
[3:16:48.260 --> 3:16:51.260]  So let's do solutions because Horowitz is coming up briefly.
[3:16:51.260 --> 3:16:56.540]  Let's just do solutions now and then to get into how the Barack Obama, it's all a distraction.
[3:16:56.540 --> 3:17:01.940]  That short-term thing, they get us diverted and distracted, that theatrical simulation
[3:17:01.940 --> 3:17:03.460]  of an election.
[3:17:03.460 --> 3:17:05.820]  Yeah, that's a great topic too.
[3:17:05.820 --> 3:17:11.560]  But I think you're quite right that the thing that we need to take away from any discussion
[3:17:11.560 --> 3:17:14.620]  like this is what the heck are we going to do about it?
[3:17:14.620 --> 3:17:18.620]  And I come back to the word power that I used a moment ago.
[3:17:18.620 --> 3:17:24.620]  The thing that the forces of freedom have been missing, at least in the United States
[3:17:24.620 --> 3:17:28.100]  in the period of time in which I've been aware of it, I've been a part of this movement
[3:17:28.100 --> 3:17:30.860]  since 1959, 1960.
[3:17:30.860 --> 3:17:36.820]  The one thing that has been missing from this movement all these years is the understanding
[3:17:36.820 --> 3:17:39.780]  and the awareness that we have to have power.
[3:17:39.780 --> 3:17:44.140]  I remember for years standing in front of audiences and saying, well, the concentration
[3:17:44.140 --> 3:17:46.860]  of power is very dangerous and that's the problem.
[3:17:46.860 --> 3:17:51.340]  All these people are getting too much power over us and we ourselves must not have power.
[3:17:51.340 --> 3:17:56.420]  We must take the power away from them somehow, but we ourselves must reject power because
[3:17:56.420 --> 3:17:57.420]  that's the problem.
[3:17:57.420 --> 3:17:58.420]  No, we need power.
[3:17:58.420 --> 3:18:02.780]  Yes, but you see, that's the part that I was missing and many people have missed.
[3:18:02.780 --> 3:18:03.980]  And then one morning I woke up.
[3:18:03.980 --> 3:18:08.700]  We only need power to tear down their structures and then to guard against the structures being
[3:18:08.700 --> 3:18:09.700]  rebuilt.
[3:18:09.700 --> 3:18:10.700]  But that is power nevertheless.
[3:18:10.700 --> 3:18:13.540]  Yes, well, it's dangerous, but see, that's where the anarchists are wrong.
[3:18:13.540 --> 3:18:17.220]  You've got to have some state to defend against the state.
[3:18:17.220 --> 3:18:18.220]  It is dangerous.
[3:18:18.220 --> 3:18:21.260]  But you've got to be eternally vigilant and guard the jewel.
[3:18:21.260 --> 3:18:22.420]  Well, you're right on target.
[3:18:22.420 --> 3:18:25.140]  You see, it took me much longer to figure this out.
[3:18:25.140 --> 3:18:29.420]  I woke up one morning and said, oh, as long as we say that we must not have power, we
[3:18:29.420 --> 3:18:30.420]  lose.
[3:18:30.420 --> 3:18:31.420]  We are going to lose.
[3:18:31.420 --> 3:18:33.500]  And so then the next step was, well, how can we...
[3:18:33.500 --> 3:18:34.500]  When I own a gun, I have power.
[3:18:34.500 --> 3:18:36.300]  When I can own proper property, I have power.
[3:18:36.300 --> 3:18:37.300]  Exactly.
[3:18:37.300 --> 3:18:42.260]  And I need power not to have bobbles and trinkets and signants of power, but to defend myself.
[3:18:42.260 --> 3:18:43.260]  Exactly.
[3:18:43.260 --> 3:18:45.620]  And that's the analogy because guns are dangerous.
[3:18:45.620 --> 3:18:46.780]  Are they not?
[3:18:46.780 --> 3:18:47.780]  Very dangerous.
[3:18:47.780 --> 3:18:49.420]  People get hurt with guns, get killed with guns.
[3:18:49.420 --> 3:18:52.420]  The only thing more dangerous is not having them when you need them.
[3:18:52.420 --> 3:18:53.420]  I got one right here.
[3:18:53.420 --> 3:18:54.420]  Do you have a griffin?
[3:18:54.420 --> 3:18:55.420]  Well...
[3:18:55.420 --> 3:18:56.420]  It's not because I'm some gun nut.
[3:18:56.420 --> 3:18:58.060]  It's because if some crazy comes in here, I'm going to defend myself.
[3:18:58.060 --> 3:19:00.220]  Yeah, you don't want to make a 9-11 call.
[3:19:00.220 --> 3:19:04.940]  And so it's the power over not coming home to my family.
[3:19:04.940 --> 3:19:05.940]  Right.
[3:19:05.940 --> 3:19:06.940]  So that's the analogy.
[3:19:06.940 --> 3:19:09.860]  We do need power to protect ourselves.
[3:19:09.860 --> 3:19:14.500]  And so in this political arena, in the ideological arena, the reason we have been losing our
[3:19:14.500 --> 3:19:19.700]  liberties is because these crazies, these collectivists, these totalitarians who have a different
[3:19:19.700 --> 3:19:20.700]  vision for...
[3:19:20.700 --> 3:19:21.700]  They crave it.
[3:19:21.700 --> 3:19:22.700]  They want it.
[3:19:22.700 --> 3:19:23.700]  And they have it.
[3:19:23.700 --> 3:19:24.700]  They have it.
[3:19:24.700 --> 3:19:27.700]  They have spent 100 years moving into the power center of the society.
[3:19:27.700 --> 3:19:30.140]  And now these freaks are going to kill 90% of us.
[3:19:30.140 --> 3:19:31.140]  Stand there, G.F.
[3:19:31.140 --> 3:19:33.300]  We're going to be right back after this break.
[3:19:33.300 --> 3:19:34.300]  This is just unbelievable.
[3:19:34.300 --> 3:19:36.420]  We'll go over past three, but it's okay.
[3:19:36.420 --> 3:19:38.860]  But you can take a break right now for four minutes, okay?
[3:19:38.860 --> 3:19:46.500]  We'll be right back, folks.
[3:19:46.500 --> 3:19:50.740]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:19:50.740 --> 3:19:55.340]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:19:55.340 --> 3:19:57.660]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[3:19:57.660 --> 3:20:01.300]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:20:01.300 --> 3:20:04.460]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:20:04.460 --> 3:20:09.460]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:20:09.460 --> 3:20:12.900]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:20:12.900 --> 3:20:19.860]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:20:19.860 --> 3:20:24.020]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:20:24.020 --> 3:20:26.820]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:20:26.820 --> 3:20:27.820]  Most people have no idea.
[3:20:27.820 --> 3:20:28.820]  They're not after money.
[3:20:28.820 --> 3:20:29.820]  They have all the money they need.
[3:20:29.820 --> 3:20:30.820]  They're after power.
[3:20:30.820 --> 3:20:31.820]  That's their after-easy.

[3:21:00.300 --> 3:21:02.740]  Your government doesn't want the best for you.
[3:21:02.740 --> 3:21:03.980]  They keep you down.
[3:21:03.980 --> 3:21:04.980]  They keep you blue.
[3:21:04.980 --> 3:21:10.100]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[3:21:10.100 --> 3:21:12.540]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[3:21:12.540 --> 3:21:16.540]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful
[3:21:16.540 --> 3:21:19.740]  for you, my friends.
[3:21:19.740 --> 3:21:24.420]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song for the heart of America wants this one.

[3:22:07.780 --> 3:22:09.740]  crime are brought to justice.

[3:22:36.460 --> 3:22:39.420]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.

[3:22:43.820 --> 3:22:45.180]  to Big Brother.
[3:22:45.180 --> 3:22:49.380]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity
[3:22:49.380 --> 3:22:50.500]  theft each year.
[3:22:50.500 --> 3:22:55.100]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average
[3:22:55.100 --> 3:22:56.540]  of $8,000.
[3:22:56.540 --> 3:23:01.060]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection
[3:23:01.060 --> 3:23:04.100]  between a hacker and your personal information.
[3:23:04.100 --> 3:23:07.980]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that
[3:23:07.980 --> 3:23:12.760]  is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[3:23:46.060 --> 3:24:03.420]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[3:24:03.420 --> 3:24:27.700]  We're going to go to break here in just a few minutes and Dr. Lynn Horowitz is going
[3:24:27.700 --> 3:24:29.420]  to be popping in for about five minutes with us.
[3:24:29.420 --> 3:24:33.540]  Dr. Griffin is going to stay with us, continuing with solutions, Freedom Force International
[3:24:33.540 --> 3:24:34.540]  sir.
[3:24:34.540 --> 3:24:36.540]  That's my cue.
[3:24:36.540 --> 3:24:37.540]  Yes sir.
[3:24:37.540 --> 3:24:38.540]  Okay.
[3:24:38.540 --> 3:24:43.940]  Well we were talking about power and the danger of power and the good analogy was made that
[3:24:43.940 --> 3:24:48.740]  guns are dangerous and that people get hurt with guns but the only thing more dangerous
[3:24:48.740 --> 3:24:50.900]  is not having them when you need them.
[3:24:50.900 --> 3:24:51.900]  Okay.
[3:24:51.900 --> 3:24:53.700]  Now we deal with political power.
[3:24:53.700 --> 3:24:55.260]  It's dangerous.
[3:24:55.260 --> 3:25:03.780]  Everybody knows Lord Acton's well-known quote, Acton said power corrupts and absolute power
[3:25:03.780 --> 3:25:06.020]  corrupts absolutely.
[3:25:06.020 --> 3:25:10.860]  And so that was the cue I had years ago to say well if power corrupts therefore we shouldn't
[3:25:10.860 --> 3:25:15.520]  have power and then I realized that if you don't have power you lose.
[3:25:15.520 --> 3:25:21.740]  So the question then became is it possible for a movement such as ours to reach for power,
[3:25:21.740 --> 3:25:29.100]  political power and yet design it in such a way that it cannot be corrupted by the power?
[3:25:29.100 --> 3:25:30.100]  And the answer is yes.
[3:25:30.100 --> 3:25:31.100]  It can be done.
[3:25:31.100 --> 3:25:32.100]  It's just never been tried.
[3:25:32.100 --> 3:25:33.100]  Well that's not true.
[3:25:33.100 --> 3:25:35.100]  It was tried in the case of the American Revolution.
[3:25:35.100 --> 3:25:38.860]  That's what the founders tried and it did separate power for a while and it did limit
[3:25:38.860 --> 3:25:42.700]  it enough for at least some freedom to take place and it was the greatest engine ever.
[3:25:42.700 --> 3:25:44.140]  It was a great experiment.
[3:25:44.140 --> 3:25:49.060]  It was the first step ever in history to where people consciously tried to write a document
[3:25:49.060 --> 3:25:51.940]  that would limit the power of their own political leaders.
[3:25:51.940 --> 3:25:54.780]  As 5% of the population got half the world's wealth.
[3:25:54.780 --> 3:25:55.780]  Yeah.
[3:25:55.780 --> 3:25:56.780]  It didn't work, did it?
[3:25:56.780 --> 3:25:59.740]  Well it's not surprising because it was a beta model.
[3:25:59.740 --> 3:26:03.100]  We are going to come to the time soon I think Alex where we're going to have a chance to
[3:26:03.100 --> 3:26:04.740]  rework that model.
[3:26:04.740 --> 3:26:08.540]  Now we go to the second model and we will have learned a lot in the process.
[3:26:08.540 --> 3:26:14.180]  The question is how can you limit people with political power from being corrupted by it?
[3:26:14.180 --> 3:26:19.800]  And the answer I believe is to have a well thought out definition of what the purpose
[3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:21.660]  of government is.
[3:26:21.660 --> 3:26:26.980]  And if we limit the power of government as we did to some extent with the Bill of Rights
[3:26:26.980 --> 3:26:32.540]  in our own constitution, say that Congress shall not have the power to do this, this
[3:26:32.540 --> 3:26:38.140]  and this and then put teeth into it, we can keep our elected leaders from being corrupted
[3:26:38.140 --> 3:26:41.340]  by power because they won't be given the power in the first place.
[3:26:41.340 --> 3:26:42.340]  That's the solution.
[3:26:42.340 --> 3:26:43.740]  Don't give them the power.
[3:26:43.740 --> 3:26:50.380]  So that's my answer to it and that's the reason that with Freedom Force International, first
[3:26:50.380 --> 3:26:55.860]  thing we did was to introduce what we call the creed of freedom.
[3:26:55.860 --> 3:27:01.460]  And the creed of freedom is the statement of principles, positive principles that all
[3:27:01.460 --> 3:27:03.540]  members adhere to.
[3:27:03.540 --> 3:27:08.300]  And if all of our members and all of our elected representatives adhered to the principles
[3:27:08.300 --> 3:27:13.620]  on the creed of freedom, then there would be no way for power to corrupt those individuals.
[3:27:13.620 --> 3:27:15.740]  So and to be clear, I mean, nothing's ever going to be perfect.
[3:27:15.740 --> 3:27:20.180]  We're striving towards more liberty, towards more freedom instead of racing at light speed
[3:27:20.180 --> 3:27:21.740]  towards total tyranny.
[3:27:21.740 --> 3:27:23.020]  Don't expect it to be perfect.
[3:27:23.020 --> 3:27:25.700]  No, human nature isn't perfect.
[3:27:25.700 --> 3:27:30.580]  But we can be a lot closer to the goal than we are now, that's for sure.
[3:27:30.580 --> 3:27:32.460]  Talk more about Freedom Force International.
[3:27:32.460 --> 3:27:37.380]  Well, the whole purpose of Freedom Force was to do basically what I've been talking about.
[3:27:37.380 --> 3:27:41.500]  And that is to help our members to acquire power.
[3:27:41.500 --> 3:27:45.700]  We know that without power, we cannot achieve any political reform.
[3:27:45.700 --> 3:27:48.700]  And in fact, the motto of Freedom Force is this.
[3:27:48.700 --> 3:27:54.980]  In English, it's those without power cannot defend freedom.
[3:27:54.980 --> 3:27:56.500]  And there it is in a nutshell.
[3:27:56.500 --> 3:28:01.380]  We've got to quit being on the outside of the halls of power, looking in, saying, oh,
[3:28:01.380 --> 3:28:05.780]  please, those of you who make political decisions, won't you please listen to us?
[3:28:05.780 --> 3:28:06.780]  Won't you please listen to us?
[3:28:06.780 --> 3:28:08.300]  Well, I've said we've even got to infiltrate.
[3:28:08.300 --> 3:28:13.740]  Now, it doesn't mean being dishonest, but be covert, you know, act like mainline conservatives,
[3:28:13.740 --> 3:28:16.060]  get into power, and then really leak info.
[3:28:16.060 --> 3:28:22.260]  I mean, at the city council, send people to jail, find the crud, hire PIs to follow corrupt
[3:28:22.260 --> 3:28:23.260]  mayors.
[3:28:23.260 --> 3:28:25.940]  You're going to catch them, put the video of them cheating on their wife on the web.
[3:28:25.940 --> 3:28:28.620]  I mean, I'll tell people to go ahead and get mean.
[3:28:28.620 --> 3:28:31.500]  Well, getting mean is that's not infiltrating.
[3:28:31.500 --> 3:28:34.060]  That's doing your obligation.
[3:28:34.060 --> 3:28:37.500]  You could go into political office because you want to serve the nation or the city.
[3:28:37.500 --> 3:28:38.500]  Well, I do.
[3:28:38.500 --> 3:28:39.500]  I want to bring down these people.
[3:28:39.500 --> 3:28:40.500]  Yeah.
[3:28:40.500 --> 3:28:41.500]  Bring down the corrupt ones.
[3:28:41.500 --> 3:28:44.580]  But that doesn't necessarily mean that that's your primary motive.
[3:28:44.580 --> 3:28:48.940]  I think people should go into political office who want to serve their community, not because
[3:28:48.940 --> 3:28:50.860]  you serve by getting the corrupt people off.
[3:28:50.860 --> 3:28:53.340]  You've got to do that first, obviously.
[3:28:53.340 --> 3:28:55.500]  So that's the nutshell.
[3:28:55.500 --> 3:28:58.780]  We have members now, Alex, in 58 countries.
[3:28:58.780 --> 3:28:59.780]  Just blows me away.
[3:28:59.780 --> 3:29:03.940]  I can't believe that because I find out that there are people in all over the world that
[3:29:03.940 --> 3:29:06.340]  have basically the same problem.
[3:29:06.340 --> 3:29:07.780]  And it's growing.
[3:29:07.780 --> 3:29:08.780]  I'll tell you what.
[3:29:08.780 --> 3:29:09.780]  Stay there.
[3:29:09.780 --> 3:29:10.780]  Stay there.
[3:29:10.780 --> 3:29:13.220]  We're going to come back and talk, shift gears about their bio weapons programs against
[3:29:13.220 --> 3:29:15.820]  us, which I know you've covered and the whole eugenics agenda.
[3:29:15.820 --> 3:29:16.820]  We're going to talk to Len Horo.
[3:29:16.820 --> 3:29:17.820]  It's about five minutes.
[3:29:17.820 --> 3:29:20.420]  Then we're going to continue going back into solutions.
[3:29:20.420 --> 3:29:24.060]  I'm going to spend a lot of time on that and then maybe a few calls, maybe go 10 minutes
[3:29:24.060 --> 3:29:27.460]  into the next hour and take a few calls as well.
[3:29:27.460 --> 3:29:28.460]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:29:28.460 --> 3:29:46.540]  We'll be right back.
[3:29:46.540 --> 3:29:51.180]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[3:29:51.180 --> 3:29:55.980]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[3:29:55.980 --> 3:29:56.980]  Hi, folks.
[3:29:56.980 --> 3:29:57.980]  Alex Jones here.
[3:29:57.980 --> 3:30:01.340]  I'm going to go back to basics and be safe with Calvin Pure Soaps.

[3:31:46.340 --> 3:31:51.500]  You can trace every disease, every illness and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[3:31:51.500 --> 3:31:56.380]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling because fruits and vegetables
[3:31:56.380 --> 3:32:00.540]  in their raw form are better absorbed, retained and utilized than have heated.
[3:32:00.540 --> 3:32:04.980]  The champion juicer is the best way to get your nutrients, your body craves.
[3:32:04.980 --> 3:32:09.460]  The champion juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[3:32:09.460 --> 3:32:13.260]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins and trace minerals.
[3:32:13.260 --> 3:32:18.660]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness
[3:32:18.660 --> 3:32:23.500]  but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable life-threatening diseases.
[3:32:23.500 --> 3:32:28.580]  Juicing with the champion juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[3:32:28.580 --> 3:32:31.380]  Put the champion juicer to work for you and your family.

[3:32:50.020 --> 3:32:55.780]  We're back live with Glenn Horowitz popping in for 10 minutes with us with G. Edward Griffin
[3:32:55.780 --> 3:32:59.860]  continuing with solutions in the fight against the New World Order.
[3:32:59.860 --> 3:33:02.620]  We've got Glenn Horowitz coming on for a full hour tomorrow.
[3:33:02.620 --> 3:33:08.660]  I appreciate him and his very busy schedule with his clinic and books and films and all the prolific work he's doing.
[3:33:08.660 --> 3:33:12.300]  Coming on on such short notice but this is why we've got him on and tomorrow
[3:33:12.300 --> 3:33:13.980]  he's going to document this for everybody.
[3:33:13.980 --> 3:33:16.940]  I know a lot of you know this but your friends, family, neighbors don't.
[3:33:16.940 --> 3:33:19.020]  Tell them tune in tomorrow for the full hour.
[3:33:19.020 --> 3:33:21.460]  Tell them to go to InLivesWeTrust.com.
[3:33:21.460 --> 3:33:25.820]  We have a story we wrote today up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[3:33:25.820 --> 3:33:29.100]  Wright says U.S. government capable of creating AIDS virus.
[3:33:29.100 --> 3:33:32.220]  Heckler's turned mute after pastor sites documented history.
[3:33:32.220 --> 3:33:34.620]  A biological warfare against innocent people.
[3:33:34.620 --> 3:33:37.820]  And Dr. Horowitz has been kind of to put his film up for free on Google video
[3:33:37.820 --> 3:33:40.220]  though he recommends you get it on DVD.
[3:33:40.220 --> 3:33:45.100]  So and I've watched it just amazing documenting all the admissions of how they're killing it.
[3:33:45.100 --> 3:33:48.460]  Much like my film Endgame, Blueprint for Global and Slavement does.
[3:33:48.460 --> 3:33:51.660]  So let's play this minute and a half of Reverend Wright at the Press Club.
[3:33:51.660 --> 3:33:55.420]  This is big news as they attack Reverend Wright all over Neocon,
[3:33:55.420 --> 3:33:59.420]  fake conservative radio, liberal TV, saying he's completely nuts.
[3:33:59.420 --> 3:34:03.020]  The government, it's never marched our troops into chambers and nerve-gassed them.
[3:34:03.020 --> 3:34:06.300]  It never let black men die without treatment for 50 years of syphilis.
[3:34:06.300 --> 3:34:08.620]  It never radiated little children.
[3:34:08.620 --> 3:34:11.340]  The government loves you. Here's Reverend Wright.
[3:34:11.340 --> 3:34:16.860]  In your sermon, you said the government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of
[3:34:16.860 --> 3:34:18.940]  genocide against people of color.
[3:34:18.940 --> 3:34:22.380]  So I ask you, do you honestly believe your statement and those words?
[3:34:23.500 --> 3:34:27.260]  Have you read Horowitz's book, Emerging Viruses, AIDS, and Ebola?
[3:34:28.380 --> 3:34:31.660]  Whoever wrote that question, have you read Medical Apartheid?
[3:34:31.660 --> 3:34:32.140]  You read it?
[3:34:32.140 --> 3:34:41.740]  No questions from the floor. I read different things.
[3:34:41.740 --> 3:34:46.700]  As I said to my members, if you haven't read things and you can't,
[3:34:46.700 --> 3:34:51.180]  yeah, based on this Tuskegee experiment and based on what has happened to
[3:34:51.180 --> 3:34:54.620]  Africans in this country, I believe our government is capable of doing anything.
[3:34:54.620 --> 3:35:04.460]  In fact, one of the responses to what Saddam Hussein had in terms of
[3:35:05.100 --> 3:35:10.060]  biological warfare was a non-question because all we had to do was check the sales record.
[3:35:10.060 --> 3:35:15.020]  We sold him those biological weapons that he was using against his own people.
[3:35:15.020 --> 3:35:18.860]  So any time a government can put together biological warfare to kill people
[3:35:18.860 --> 3:35:22.940]  and then get angry when those people use what we sold them,
[3:35:22.940 --> 3:35:24.540]  yes, I believe we are capable.
[3:35:26.220 --> 3:35:30.220]  And again, for a full hour tomorrow when I've got Dr. Lynn Horowitz on,
[3:35:30.220 --> 3:35:35.020]  just on this particular subject, but there it is being cited that's all over national television,
[3:35:35.020 --> 3:35:38.220]  which is going to backfire on him because they're going to find his film,
[3:35:38.220 --> 3:35:41.180]  they're going to find his best-selling book, they're going to find out.
[3:35:41.180 --> 3:35:44.540]  And by the way, I didn't just believe Horowitz and others when I discovered all this 12 years ago,
[3:35:45.340 --> 3:35:46.780]  though I found him to be very accurate.
[3:35:46.780 --> 3:35:51.100]  I went out and looked it up myself and found out that it's a hall of horrors.
[3:35:51.100 --> 3:35:53.100]  It just never seems to end.
[3:35:53.100 --> 3:35:55.660]  Dr. Horowitz, thanks for coming on short notice.
[3:35:55.660 --> 3:36:01.820]  Your take on this firestorm nationally right now being triggered by Reverend Wright reading your book and others.
[3:36:02.700 --> 3:36:07.420]  Well, it's obvious that the mainstream media is really completely taking everybody away
[3:36:07.420 --> 3:36:09.660]  from the most important thing is the genocide.
[3:36:10.380 --> 3:36:12.860]  I know you've been telling people that, I've been saying that.
[3:36:13.420 --> 3:36:15.900]  G. Edward Griffin has been saying that many others.
[3:36:15.900 --> 3:36:18.540]  And the fact that he can make such a statement,
[3:36:18.540 --> 3:36:23.180]  he could cite the scientific evidence, the book Emerging Viruses,
[3:36:23.180 --> 3:36:27.900]  the documentation we have on the website, originofaids.com,
[3:36:28.460 --> 3:36:32.220]  the movie, as you mentioned, that's freely downloadable in Lives We Trust,
[3:36:32.220 --> 3:36:36.540]  showing the documents that shows the United States federal government created
[3:36:36.540 --> 3:36:39.180]  numerous AIDS-like and Ebola-like viruses.
[3:36:39.180 --> 3:36:43.900]  Let them out, virtually Henry Kissinger's directive to develop these things
[3:36:43.900 --> 3:36:49.980]  and through the Merck Pharmaceutical Company, supplied by the Nixon White House official
[3:36:49.980 --> 3:36:52.780]  named Roy Ash's company, was lit in biometrics.
[3:36:52.780 --> 3:36:55.820]  They created the vaccines from the Merck company.
[3:36:55.820 --> 3:36:59.660]  The CDC played a role in developing the vaccine hepatitis B vaccine,
[3:36:59.660 --> 3:37:02.620]  given the gay men in New York City, blacks in Central Africa,
[3:37:02.620 --> 3:37:09.660]  that absolutely slam dunk evidence proves that this was what triggered the international AIDS pandemic.
[3:37:09.660 --> 3:37:12.860]  Now, for the media to not be focusing on that,
[3:37:12.860 --> 3:37:17.020]  millions of people dying, and they're going to go right along,
[3:37:17.020 --> 3:37:20.780]  play the same old, same old political nonsense games that they're playing.
[3:37:20.780 --> 3:37:23.420]  This is genocide, and it's got to stop.
[3:37:23.420 --> 3:37:27.340]  And even Al Sharpton's criticizing Wright for talking about Tuskegee.
[3:37:27.340 --> 3:37:31.100]  I mean, they just deny all this to their faces.
[3:37:31.100 --> 3:37:36.780]  But I guess Margaret Sanger went and hired W.E.B. Du Bois and others to go,
[3:37:36.780 --> 3:37:39.660]  as you said, we can't let the blacks know we want to exterminate them.
[3:37:39.660 --> 3:37:41.340]  By the way, that's an exact quote.
[3:37:41.340 --> 3:37:45.340]  So we've, you know, the head of the Soap Foundation was a Colgate.
[3:37:45.340 --> 3:37:48.300]  He, you know, he's giving me money to go hire the blacks as our fronts.
[3:37:48.860 --> 3:37:50.060]  And I just think it's shameful.
[3:37:50.620 --> 3:37:53.660]  Disgustingly, it makes you nauseous.
[3:37:53.660 --> 3:37:57.980]  And the fact that they have black men and women who could watch their own people
[3:37:57.980 --> 3:38:03.660]  and millions of others, various races, die without actually benefiting.
[3:38:03.660 --> 3:38:05.500]  Not necessarily just keeping their mouths shut,
[3:38:05.500 --> 3:38:09.660]  but actually being part of the conspiracy of silence
[3:38:09.660 --> 3:38:12.220]  that is literally allowing this genocide to continue.
[3:38:12.860 --> 3:38:14.060]  This is despicable.
[3:38:14.620 --> 3:38:16.300]  It is beyond human.
[3:38:16.300 --> 3:38:21.180]  It is alien to any kind of loving person.
[3:38:21.180 --> 3:38:24.460]  But they claim it's unjustifies the means for the greater good of the earth
[3:38:24.460 --> 3:38:25.100]  and the elite.
[3:38:25.100 --> 3:38:26.700]  G.O.R. Griffin, your take on this.
[3:38:26.700 --> 3:38:30.540]  Well, yeah, that's how they justify all of these insane programs.
[3:38:30.540 --> 3:38:33.260]  And so we have to sacrifice a few people along the way.
[3:38:33.260 --> 3:38:35.660]  200,000 people or a few million people.
[3:38:35.660 --> 3:38:38.220]  Look at the great benefit that comes out of this.
[3:38:38.220 --> 3:38:40.620]  You know, we've got population control now.
[3:38:40.620 --> 3:38:44.380]  So it's in the long run, they claim that they're quite humanitarian.
[3:38:44.380 --> 3:38:48.860]  In LiesWeTrust.com, Dr. Horowitz is on for a full hour tomorrow with us
[3:38:48.860 --> 3:38:52.780]  to really break down the documents and go through this and talk about his new film.
[3:38:52.780 --> 3:38:54.780]  Dr. Horowitz, we'll talk to you tomorrow.
[3:38:54.780 --> 3:38:56.860]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[3:38:56.860 --> 3:38:57.340]  Pleasure.
[3:38:57.340 --> 3:38:57.900]  Thanks, guys.
[3:38:57.900 --> 3:38:58.300]  Bye.
[3:38:58.300 --> 3:38:59.020]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[3:38:59.020 --> 3:38:59.260]  Bye.
[3:38:59.260 --> 3:38:59.820]  Bye.
[3:38:59.820 --> 3:39:02.860]  I thought we'd bring you that newsmaker there.
[3:39:02.860 --> 3:39:05.660]  G.O.R. Griffin, I mean, for the average person out there,
[3:39:05.660 --> 3:39:09.500]  it's hard for them, they judge the world according to their social mores.
[3:39:09.500 --> 3:39:12.620]  They don't understand that the elite have stated what they're doing.
[3:39:12.620 --> 3:39:15.980]  I keep using this example because there's hundreds of them to use.
[3:39:15.980 --> 3:39:20.140]  But one of the prominent biology professors at the University of Texas here in Austin,
[3:39:20.140 --> 3:39:24.460]  Dr. Pionka, two years ago, came out and gave a speech at the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[3:39:24.460 --> 3:39:27.740]  He's gotten awards in Europe from prestigious universities.
[3:39:27.740 --> 3:39:29.660]  He said, we need to kill 90%.
[3:39:29.660 --> 3:39:31.420]  I can't wait till Ebola gets airborne.
[3:39:31.420 --> 3:39:35.180]  And he showed a PowerPoint of skulls.
[3:39:35.180 --> 3:39:38.300]  And he dressed, he on his own website, on the UT website.
[3:39:38.300 --> 3:39:41.580]  He dresses as a druid and talks about how he loves Lucifer.
[3:39:41.580 --> 3:39:43.180]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[3:39:43.180 --> 3:39:47.020]  I mean, these people are just totally insane, but they've got power.
[3:39:47.020 --> 3:39:52.140]  But the news is that two different papers reported what shocked scientists in attendance
[3:39:52.140 --> 3:39:54.140]  was 95% standing ovation.
[3:39:54.140 --> 3:39:58.460]  Not at the end, but repeatedly, when he said, everyone needs to die.
[3:39:58.460 --> 3:40:01.500]  And then I had his graduate students, and I tracked who they were.
[3:40:01.500 --> 3:40:04.460]  I'd Google their name afterwards, and they'd say, here's my online.
[3:40:04.460 --> 3:40:06.460]  This is why I got a doctorate in.
[3:40:06.460 --> 3:40:10.460]  They'd be running biolaboratories and level three weapons labs.
[3:40:10.460 --> 3:40:14.460]  And you'd go, my god, it'd be young women, men.
[3:40:14.460 --> 3:40:16.460]  And they're like, he is not extreme enough.
[3:40:16.460 --> 3:40:18.460]  We are for total death of the humans.
[3:40:18.460 --> 3:40:20.460]  That human is a scourge.
[3:40:20.460 --> 3:40:22.460]  And it's like, we will soon deal with all of you.
[3:40:22.460 --> 3:40:24.460]  And they're in the bioweapons labs.
[3:40:24.460 --> 3:40:28.460]  And they're sending me threatening letters with their name.
[3:40:28.460 --> 3:40:30.460]  And then I post their picture saying, look at this person.
[3:40:30.460 --> 3:40:32.460]  They gave me, and they freak out on me and threaten me.
[3:40:32.460 --> 3:40:38.460]  I mean, because in their own little bubble, it's all kill, kill everyone.
[3:40:38.460 --> 3:40:40.460]  Death is wonderful.
[3:40:40.460 --> 3:40:42.460]  I mean, I don't think listeners can understand.
[3:40:42.460 --> 3:40:44.460]  I'm not joking.
[3:40:44.460 --> 3:40:46.460]  These people are dangerous.
[3:40:46.460 --> 3:40:48.460]  They're everywhere.
[3:40:48.460 --> 3:40:50.460]  G. Ebergriffe, can you talk about the large population reduction program?
[3:40:50.460 --> 3:40:52.460]  Ted Turner, Prince Philip, all these statements.
[3:40:52.460 --> 3:40:56.460]  Yeah, well, it always comes back to that issue of the greater good for the greater number.
[3:40:56.460 --> 3:40:58.460]  And people might say, well, how can that be?
[3:40:58.460 --> 3:41:04.460]  If they're planning to get rid of 80 to 90% of the population, that's the greater number right there.
[3:41:04.460 --> 3:41:08.460]  Well, what they miss is that it's not really the greater number.
[3:41:08.460 --> 3:41:10.460]  The issue is the greater good.
[3:41:10.460 --> 3:41:12.460]  And the greater good of the greater number.
[3:41:12.460 --> 3:41:14.460]  And it's the greater good of the elite.
[3:41:14.460 --> 3:41:18.460]  They have to survive as guardians because they have the great vision.
[3:41:18.460 --> 3:41:22.460]  They also, they have the vision of preserving the ecology of the planet.
[3:41:22.460 --> 3:41:24.460]  You see, our environment is in danger.
[3:41:24.460 --> 3:41:26.460]  So now we get rid of 90%.
[3:41:26.460 --> 3:41:28.460]  So we kill these humans.
[3:41:28.460 --> 3:41:32.460]  Yeah, because they like to make it seem like the humans are the ones endangering the environment.
[3:41:32.460 --> 3:41:36.460]  So now you see the greater good is to preserve planet Earth.
[3:41:36.460 --> 3:41:40.460]  And if we have to get rid of human beings, then that is a humanitarian.
[3:41:40.460 --> 3:41:42.460]  Well, it's beautiful.
[3:41:42.460 --> 3:41:44.460]  In fact, he wrote, he was interviewed by TV and newspaper.
[3:41:44.460 --> 3:41:46.460]  He said, I know my family needs to die first.
[3:41:46.460 --> 3:41:48.460]  It's very sad, but it's also beautiful.
[3:41:48.460 --> 3:41:50.460]  We're all going to be dead soon.
[3:41:50.460 --> 3:41:52.460]  You'll see soon.
[3:41:52.460 --> 3:41:54.460]  And meanwhile you find out they cooked up Ebola.
[3:41:54.460 --> 3:41:56.460]  Yeah.
[3:41:56.460 --> 3:41:58.460]  I mean, my God, these people need to all be arrested immediately.
[3:41:58.460 --> 3:42:00.460]  Yeah.
[3:42:00.460 --> 3:42:02.460]  And talk about power.
[3:42:02.460 --> 3:42:04.460]  We need the power to grow some and get up and stand up against them.
[3:42:04.460 --> 3:42:06.460]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[3:42:06.460 --> 3:42:08.460]  The most incredible part is the applause that these people get.
[3:42:08.460 --> 3:42:14.460]  And the only reason they get the applause and the endorsement is because the audience is so tuned,
[3:42:14.460 --> 3:42:19.460]  so focused on saving the planet against human effect on the planet.
[3:42:19.460 --> 3:42:22.460]  It's horrible to say we have to kill 355,000 people a day,
[3:42:22.460 --> 3:42:24.460]  but it's even more horrible not to say it.
[3:42:24.460 --> 3:42:26.460]  Yeah, thank you, Jacques Cousteau.
[3:42:26.460 --> 3:42:28.460]  Yeah.
[3:42:28.460 --> 3:42:30.460]  Well, I want to tell all this scum.
[3:42:30.460 --> 3:42:32.460]  They need to just, I want to see them all hanging themselves,
[3:42:32.460 --> 3:42:34.460]  slitting their own throats.
[3:42:34.460 --> 3:42:36.460]  I want to see them jumping off cliffs, not me and my family.
[3:42:36.460 --> 3:42:38.460]  Listen, you bastards, you're not going to kill me without a fight.
[3:42:38.460 --> 3:42:40.460]  Well, amen. I love that.
[3:42:40.460 --> 3:42:42.460]  Let's talk about power. How do we get power?
[3:42:42.460 --> 3:42:44.460]  The same way we lost it.
[3:42:44.460 --> 3:42:46.460]  And the way we lost it in this country, let's talk about that.
[3:42:46.460 --> 3:42:52.460]  It's not because somebody showed up on our shores with uniforms and weapons in their hand
[3:42:52.460 --> 3:42:54.460]  and invaded us.
[3:42:54.460 --> 3:42:58.460]  It's because they crept into our universities and into our media centers,
[3:42:58.460 --> 3:43:02.460]  and they crept into our think tanks, and they crept into our government agencies.
[3:43:02.460 --> 3:43:06.460]  And the big banker foundations funded that whole thing.
[3:43:06.460 --> 3:43:10.460]  Creeping into the power centers of society very quietly,
[3:43:10.460 --> 3:43:14.460]  unobtrusively, with a mission to control.
[3:43:14.460 --> 3:43:16.460]  Now, what are the power centers of society?
[3:43:16.460 --> 3:43:18.460]  Well, that's easy.
[3:43:18.460 --> 3:43:20.460]  At the top of the list, you'd say political parties, government agencies,
[3:43:20.460 --> 3:43:22.460]  you know, labor unions, church organizations.
[3:43:22.460 --> 3:43:24.460]  But then you get a little more subtle.
[3:43:24.460 --> 3:43:28.460]  You realize that, well, those are media organizations as well.
[3:43:28.460 --> 3:43:32.460]  Networks, publications, book publishers, and so forth.
[3:43:32.460 --> 3:43:36.460]  And then the educational universities, the school systems,
[3:43:36.460 --> 3:43:38.460]  even at your local state level.
[3:43:38.460 --> 3:43:41.460]  Look at the people who are sitting on the boards of directors,
[3:43:41.460 --> 3:43:44.460]  and the controlling power within all of these groups.
[3:43:44.460 --> 3:43:49.460]  Nine chances out of ten, you're going to find people who have this collectivist mentality.
[3:43:49.460 --> 3:43:52.460]  Now, it didn't just happen with a flip of the coin.
[3:43:52.460 --> 3:43:55.460]  This was not accidental. This was not a random thing.
[3:43:55.460 --> 3:44:01.460]  People who believe in this concept know instinctively that they must acquire power over us
[3:44:01.460 --> 3:44:05.460]  to force their views on us against our will.
[3:44:05.460 --> 3:44:09.460]  And they know that the agency or the engine of force is government.
[3:44:09.460 --> 3:44:11.460]  And that's where they go.
[3:44:11.460 --> 3:44:14.460]  That's how it happened. We lost our freedoms, and we lost control
[3:44:14.460 --> 3:44:18.460]  because the agencies of power had been conquered quietly from the inside.
[3:44:18.460 --> 3:44:20.460]  And now they know, and they project it.
[3:44:20.460 --> 3:44:22.460]  I mean, they're very sophisticated.
[3:44:22.460 --> 3:44:24.460]  They know that they can carry out eugenics programs.
[3:44:24.460 --> 3:44:26.460]  It comes out they're killing people.
[3:44:26.460 --> 3:44:29.460]  Then they make it a black-white thing, though it's really against everybody.
[3:44:29.460 --> 3:44:33.460]  It's just more of a soft kill in the Western world because they don't want to get caught.
[3:44:33.460 --> 3:44:37.460]  They can do a little bit of the harder kills in Africa and Asia where they can cover it up better.
[3:44:37.460 --> 3:44:40.460]  UN shows up, gives all the pregnant women shots with the police because they've been paid.
[3:44:40.460 --> 3:44:43.460]  They all have miscarriages, and then they can't have babies anymore.
[3:44:43.460 --> 3:44:45.460]  That's all admitted. Then they test the vaccine.
[3:44:45.460 --> 3:44:49.460]  It's got a very expensive synthetic hormone added that sterilizes them
[3:44:49.460 --> 3:44:51.460]  because it was added to the pathogen of the tetanus.
[3:44:51.460 --> 3:44:55.460]  I mean, they do this, and the cop just knows he's been given some money.
[3:44:55.460 --> 3:45:00.460]  You know, the local mayor just, you know, it's poor villagers who can't fight back.
[3:45:00.460 --> 3:45:05.460]  You know, we need to break through the compartmentalization and show their minions what they're part of.
[3:45:05.460 --> 3:45:07.460]  So how do we deal with not just taking power?
[3:45:07.460 --> 3:45:11.460]  I don't want to hear your ideas of getting that power back and then dismantling their system
[3:45:11.460 --> 3:45:14.460]  and building bulwarks against its reemergence.
[3:45:14.460 --> 3:45:19.460]  But how do we, they foresaw us fighting back when they really started to squeeze?
[3:45:19.460 --> 3:45:24.460]  They tried to handcuff us down before they sucked us dry, like a spider gets us tied up first.
[3:45:24.460 --> 3:45:28.460]  But they know some of us aren't completely tied up, so they've built FEMA camps,
[3:45:28.460 --> 3:45:30.460]  authorized the cops to mindlessly follow orders.
[3:45:30.460 --> 3:45:32.460]  They've put the surveillance grid in.
[3:45:32.460 --> 3:45:36.460]  So when they implode the economy, they can come in and get full control.
[3:45:36.460 --> 3:45:37.460]  How do we counter that?
[3:45:37.460 --> 3:45:39.460]  Well, boy, there's so many issues there.
[3:45:39.460 --> 3:45:42.460]  Alex, I don't know that I have the answer to all of them or even many of them,
[3:45:42.460 --> 3:45:47.460]  but I do know that there is an answer to that question in general.
[3:45:47.460 --> 3:45:52.460]  The first step that we mentioned earlier is to get more people into our ranks.
[3:45:52.460 --> 3:45:54.460]  We cannot do it with the numbers we now have.
[3:45:54.460 --> 3:46:00.460]  So this business of educating and spreading the word still has a great deal of value.
[3:46:00.460 --> 3:46:03.460]  But then after that point, and even now, while we're doing that,
[3:46:03.460 --> 3:46:07.460]  we've got to mobilize these people to network with each other.
[3:46:07.460 --> 3:46:12.460]  And my solution is that they have to help each other get into these power centers of society.
[3:46:12.460 --> 3:46:14.460]  They have to run for office.
[3:46:14.460 --> 3:46:17.460]  They have to develop ways and means of raising money to support the campaign.
[3:46:17.460 --> 3:46:18.460]  Is it immoral?
[3:46:18.460 --> 3:46:21.460]  Is it immoral to be covert about what you plan to do in government?
[3:46:21.460 --> 3:46:24.460]  See, that's what they did. And so this is a war.
[3:46:24.460 --> 3:46:27.460]  Do we have some of our people go underground?
[3:46:27.460 --> 3:46:32.460]  Some of our people not associate with us and covertly operate as sleepers?
[3:46:32.460 --> 3:46:35.460]  And the government's already warning of that for decades.
[3:46:35.460 --> 3:46:36.460]  They've already foreseen that threat.
[3:46:36.460 --> 3:46:38.460]  And then they're not to do illegal things,
[3:46:38.460 --> 3:46:41.460]  but to expose all their criminality once we get into power positions.
[3:46:41.460 --> 3:46:45.460]  Or is there a danger of being co-opted and selling out if you get in that nest?
[3:46:45.460 --> 3:46:50.460]  My answer to that is you don't even need to deal with the ethical question.
[3:46:50.460 --> 3:46:54.460]  Well, the electronic voting machine. See, it's almost like you've got a cheat to get in there.
[3:46:54.460 --> 3:46:55.460]  Is that cheating?
[3:46:55.460 --> 3:47:01.460]  My answer to that is it's never strategically right or ethically right to be deceitful. Never.
[3:47:01.460 --> 3:47:04.460]  That's why I was asking. I never do it. I'm just like a bull in a china shop.
[3:47:04.460 --> 3:47:08.460]  But I can see strategically, then, that gives them a big advantage because they can lie.
[3:47:08.460 --> 3:47:11.460]  But in the end, that's why they're discredited because they do.
[3:47:11.460 --> 3:47:13.460]  That's right. We have the advantage because we don't lie.
[3:47:13.460 --> 3:47:19.460]  That is, being always and not having to worry about what lie you told last is a tremendous advantage.
[3:47:19.460 --> 3:47:20.460]  Absolutely.
[3:47:20.460 --> 3:47:23.460]  Just say it the way it really is. I don't think we need to resort to those methods.
[3:47:23.460 --> 3:47:27.460]  So anyway, the step is we've got to get networked together.
[3:47:27.460 --> 3:47:31.460]  We've got to help each other get into these power centers and be prepared to do battle.
[3:47:31.460 --> 3:47:33.460]  Now, right now, there's a perfect example of that.
[3:47:33.460 --> 3:47:41.460]  There are these Ron Paul groups that are struggling to get their delegates seated at the various state nominating committees and conventions.
[3:47:41.460 --> 3:47:45.460]  And they're being just learning now what the reality of political life is.
[3:47:45.460 --> 3:47:48.460]  They go vote for Paul in the head because people say, no, you can't.
[3:47:48.460 --> 3:47:49.460]  Yeah, they can't. Yeah.
[3:47:49.460 --> 3:47:52.460]  What if they put their energy into cadres of fighting in the EU?
[3:47:52.460 --> 3:47:58.460]  I've said Paul should tell them, give them work to do and give them ideas where they can actually bear some fruit.
[3:47:58.460 --> 3:48:04.460]  Well, also, I think they need to be prepared to face this kind of opposition within these Republican groups.
[3:48:04.460 --> 3:48:08.460]  For example, right now, I was talking with a few people just the other day.
[3:48:08.460 --> 3:48:13.460]  They said, well, you know, they broke the rules during the convention.
[3:48:13.460 --> 3:48:14.460]  They actually broke their rules.
[3:48:14.460 --> 3:48:18.460]  And I said to them, well, of course they did. What are rules to these people?
[3:48:18.460 --> 3:48:27.460]  And just engaging, all of you out there engaging and losing is half the battle because you learn they really are corrupt and you learn their tricks and you get smarter each time.
[3:48:27.460 --> 3:48:30.460]  That's right. And so you know that you're dealing with totalitarians.
[3:48:30.460 --> 3:48:35.460]  Totalitarians have one moral code and that's the morality of war.
[3:48:35.460 --> 3:48:39.460]  That means there's only one immoral act and that's to lose.
[3:48:39.460 --> 3:48:42.460]  Everything else is moral. That's what we're up against.
[3:48:42.460 --> 3:48:44.460]  So what do you do when you're facing people like that?
[3:48:44.460 --> 3:48:53.460]  That doesn't mean you have to adopt that morality, but it does mean you have to be prepared for them to do absolutely anything to keep you from winning.
[3:48:53.460 --> 3:48:56.460]  And now what you do about that, I cannot give advice.
[3:48:56.460 --> 3:49:08.460]  Let's say that you went to a convention and you knew that if you had a majority vote, you thought that these people might bring thugs in to just physically beat you up and throw you out.
[3:49:08.460 --> 3:49:11.460]  That happens. It happens all the time. What do you do about it?
[3:49:11.460 --> 3:49:13.460]  100 years ago, they would mow down labor unions.
[3:49:13.460 --> 3:49:16.460]  Yeah, right. This is as old as history.
[3:49:16.460 --> 3:49:17.460]  Now they run the private prisons.
[3:49:17.460 --> 3:49:19.460]  Yeah. So now what do you do with that?
[3:49:19.460 --> 3:49:23.460]  And I know what I would do, I would get all my big sons and say, come on with me.
[3:49:23.460 --> 3:49:24.460]  As many big guys as I could.
[3:49:24.460 --> 3:49:27.460]  And that's why they got the SWAT teams ready to mow you down and plant bombs on you.
[3:49:27.460 --> 3:49:30.460]  So you got to educate people that they're the terrorists first.
[3:49:30.460 --> 3:49:31.460]  That's right. Yeah.
[3:49:31.460 --> 3:49:34.460]  So there's no simple answer is there, but we do have to be aware of it.
[3:49:34.460 --> 3:49:35.460]  No, I mean, that really does come down to it.
[3:49:35.460 --> 3:49:39.460]  If this country had a lot of freedom, we haven't been perfect because people were willing to kill.
[3:49:39.460 --> 3:49:41.460]  And there was a rule, you mess with me, I'm going to kill you.
[3:49:41.460 --> 3:49:43.460]  That's why I'm down here in Texas when the old Texans,
[3:49:43.460 --> 3:49:45.460]  there wasn't a lot of cheating and stealing going on.
[3:49:45.460 --> 3:49:48.460]  Cause you mess with somebody's daughter or you do or you cheat somebody.
[3:49:48.460 --> 3:49:49.460]  They're going to kill you.
[3:49:49.460 --> 3:49:52.460]  Yeah. I mean, just 50, 60 years ago, people to kill you around here.
[3:49:52.460 --> 3:49:54.460]  Now, now we've been galded and ninnyed. So there's more corruption.
[3:49:54.460 --> 3:49:56.460]  But it used to, I mean, I remember the stories.
[3:49:56.460 --> 3:50:00.460]  I mean, I had grandpas and I mean great grandpas and people who went and killed people.
[3:50:00.460 --> 3:50:02.460]  I mean, you know, you cheat them, they're just going to kill you.
[3:50:02.460 --> 3:50:04.460]  And then nothing's really down about it.
[3:50:04.460 --> 3:50:07.460]  Yeah, it didn't happen very often because of that was the consequence.
[3:50:07.460 --> 3:50:10.460]  You know, then in the pioneer days when just about everybody had a,
[3:50:10.460 --> 3:50:14.460]  a six shooter strapped to their hip, there was very little crime.
[3:50:14.460 --> 3:50:17.460]  Obviously. Now, contrary to what you see in, in the western movies.
[3:50:17.460 --> 3:50:22.460]  Here's an example. Let's say you rob somebody's cotton shipment being taken down by wagons.
[3:50:22.460 --> 3:50:26.460]  This is, you know, my great, great, great grandpa, Johnson, you know,
[3:50:26.460 --> 3:50:29.460]  if they caught, if somebody did rob the people bringing that thing,
[3:50:29.460 --> 3:50:31.460]  they would spend whatever it took to track them down and kill them.
[3:50:31.460 --> 3:50:32.460]  Yeah.
[3:50:32.460 --> 3:50:35.460]  And so it's just people took things seriously and the police used to,
[3:50:35.460 --> 3:50:37.460]  we used to have 300,000 cops 15 years ago.
[3:50:37.460 --> 3:50:39.460]  If your house got robbed, they'd come out.
[3:50:39.460 --> 3:50:41.460]  Now we have 2 million. They won't come out to your house.
[3:50:41.460 --> 3:50:43.460]  We're going to continue during this break on the info war streams.
[3:50:43.460 --> 3:50:45.460]  Come over to info wars. Listen right now.
[3:50:45.460 --> 3:50:50.460]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[3:50:50.460 --> 3:50:55.460]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:50:55.460 --> 3:50:57.460]  It's known as the builder bird.
[3:50:57.460 --> 3:51:00.460]  But their objective being world domination.
[3:51:00.460 --> 3:51:03.460]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:51:03.460 --> 3:51:06.460]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[3:51:06.460 --> 3:51:11.460]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:51:11.460 --> 3:51:19.460]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:51:19.460 --> 3:51:23.460]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:51:23.460 --> 3:51:26.460]  Builders make great progress for the world government.
[3:51:26.460 --> 3:51:28.460]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[3:51:28.460 --> 3:51:30.460]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[3:52:45.460 --> 3:52:47.460]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[3:52:47.460 --> 3:52:51.460]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[3:52:51.460 --> 3:52:53.460]  In Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[3:52:53.460 --> 3:52:56.460]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:52:56.460 --> 3:53:02.460]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.

[3:53:45.460 --> 3:53:48.460]  Big time.
[3:53:48.460 --> 3:53:51.460]  Big time.
[3:53:51.460 --> 3:53:53.460]  Every morning at the mine.
[3:53:53.460 --> 3:53:55.460]  Look, I said I'd take calls.
[3:53:55.460 --> 3:53:56.460]  Six foot six.
[3:53:56.460 --> 3:53:58.460]  And I haven't.
[3:53:58.460 --> 3:53:59.460]  And I'm not going to have time to.
[3:53:59.460 --> 3:54:00.460]  I'm sorry, everybody.
[3:54:00.460 --> 3:54:02.460]  We're going to go about five minutes in the next hour,
[3:54:02.460 --> 3:54:04.460]  but I have a meeting I have to be at at 10 after,
[3:54:04.460 --> 3:54:06.460]  so we can't go too much overdrive.
[3:54:06.460 --> 3:54:12.460]  G. Edward Griffin is going to be speaking tonight at the University of Texas.
[3:54:12.460 --> 3:54:15.460]  And that is in the gesture dormitory.
[3:54:15.460 --> 3:54:18.460]  It's a large area of large classrooms that hold like 400 people a piece.
[3:54:18.460 --> 3:54:21.460]  They may even be in one of the bigger ones.
[3:54:21.460 --> 3:54:25.460]  You can go to PNAC citizen or go to bravenewbooks.com.
[3:54:25.460 --> 3:54:30.460]  They have a link over there where you can find it all for yourself as well.
[3:54:30.460 --> 3:54:33.460]  And G. Edward Griffin, I'm really impressed with this interview today.
[3:54:33.460 --> 3:54:35.460]  And it's really going to well be in face to face with you.
[3:54:35.460 --> 3:54:36.460]  Thank you.
[3:54:36.460 --> 3:54:38.460]  I want to in the next few months have you back off maybe two,
[3:54:38.460 --> 3:54:41.460]  three hours to really get into solutions and Freedom Force International.
[3:54:41.460 --> 3:54:45.460]  And the types of moral power we can take on to tear down their major structures.
[3:54:45.460 --> 3:54:49.460]  And then, as I said, a much more limited government to guard against that,
[3:54:49.460 --> 3:54:53.460]  because the pure anarchists don't understand in even bands of five, six,
[3:54:53.460 --> 3:54:55.460]  nomadic humans, you're going to have a leader.
[3:54:55.460 --> 3:54:57.460]  And so you're always going to have centralization.
[3:54:57.460 --> 3:54:59.460]  Anarchy only goes on for about five hours.
[3:54:59.460 --> 3:55:01.460]  And the law of the jungle comes in.
[3:55:01.460 --> 3:55:04.460]  We need the good people, as Thomas Jefferson said,
[3:55:04.460 --> 3:55:08.460]  to band together for limited government as a bulwark against the state
[3:55:08.460 --> 3:55:09.460]  and against organized crime.
[3:55:09.460 --> 3:55:12.460]  And I want to get more of your comments on that.
[3:55:12.460 --> 3:55:15.460]  Well, boy, you go over so many things so fast, Alex.
[3:55:15.460 --> 3:55:17.460]  I can hardly keep track.
[3:55:17.460 --> 3:55:21.460]  All I can remember is the last thing you said, which is so true.
[3:55:21.460 --> 3:55:22.460]  Anarchy doesn't last.
[3:55:22.460 --> 3:55:23.460]  You said five hours.
[3:55:23.460 --> 3:55:25.460]  OK, I would say five days.
[3:55:25.460 --> 3:55:27.460]  But what difference does that make?
[3:55:27.460 --> 3:55:33.460]  In conditions of anarchy, always the guy with the biggest muscle,
[3:55:33.460 --> 3:55:36.460]  the biggest fist or the biggest weapon winds up dominating.
[3:55:36.460 --> 3:55:37.460]  Kingrad.
[3:55:37.460 --> 3:55:38.460]  Kingrad, yeah.
[3:55:38.460 --> 3:55:41.460]  And so when you talk about this political spectrum,
[3:55:41.460 --> 3:55:45.460]  supposedly between total government on one end
[3:55:45.460 --> 3:55:47.460]  and zero government on the other,
[3:55:47.460 --> 3:55:49.460]  and you talk about gradients in between,
[3:55:49.460 --> 3:55:52.460]  what you're really talking about is if you take the ends of this
[3:55:52.460 --> 3:55:55.460]  and bend them up, and you make a circle out of it,
[3:55:55.460 --> 3:55:58.460]  so that instead of a straight line, you've bent that straight line up
[3:55:58.460 --> 3:56:01.460]  and now it's a circle, and you see that the end of the line
[3:56:01.460 --> 3:56:06.460]  that represents zero government is now touching the other end of the line
[3:56:06.460 --> 3:56:08.460]  that represents total government.
[3:56:08.460 --> 3:56:11.460]  And that is what you're talking about, because under conditions of anarchy,
[3:56:11.460 --> 3:56:13.460]  in an instant you step over that line,
[3:56:13.460 --> 3:56:18.460]  and you are subject completely to the totalitarian dictatorship
[3:56:18.460 --> 3:56:21.460]  of the person with the biggest fist or the biggest weapon.
[3:56:21.460 --> 3:56:23.460]  And then it's escaped from New York.
[3:56:23.460 --> 3:56:24.460]  He's the Duke.
[3:56:24.460 --> 3:56:25.460]  He's a number one.
[3:56:25.460 --> 3:56:26.460]  I mean, it just happens like that.
[3:56:26.460 --> 3:56:27.460]  And that's what these...
[3:56:27.460 --> 3:56:30.460]  But you know, when you really watch these mainline anarchist groups,
[3:56:30.460 --> 3:56:31.460]  I don't mean their followers.
[3:56:31.460 --> 3:56:32.460]  It's all foundation funded.
[3:56:32.460 --> 3:56:33.460]  They hire them.
[3:56:33.460 --> 3:56:37.460]  Limbaugh's called for riots in Denver, so has recreate, you know,
[3:56:37.460 --> 3:56:39.460]  68 subgroups.
[3:56:39.460 --> 3:56:41.460]  Again, they want to bring...
[3:56:41.460 --> 3:56:43.460]  And you find out a lot of these anarchists claim they're anarchists,
[3:56:43.460 --> 3:56:45.460]  but then they'll tell you they're communists.
[3:56:45.460 --> 3:56:48.460]  And so that's really the new cover for them.
[3:56:48.460 --> 3:56:49.460]  Yes.
[3:56:49.460 --> 3:56:51.460]  Well, they're Marxist's Leninists,
[3:56:51.460 --> 3:56:53.460]  because they're remembering that old line about Marx,
[3:56:53.460 --> 3:56:55.460]  that the state will wither away.
[3:56:55.460 --> 3:56:56.460]  They actually believe that.
[3:56:56.460 --> 3:57:00.460]  That under conditions of mature socialism, Marx taught,
[3:57:00.460 --> 3:57:03.460]  well, then mankind will have been reconditioned and retrained.
[3:57:03.460 --> 3:57:07.460]  And all of these evil characteristics have been weeded out.
[3:57:07.460 --> 3:57:09.460]  And now we can live in perfect harmony with each other.
[3:57:09.460 --> 3:57:11.460]  But really, it manifests 10 times worse.
[3:57:11.460 --> 3:57:15.460]  Much worse, because there's always this leadership group.
[3:57:15.460 --> 3:57:18.460]  They call it the Communist Party, or the Vanguard, or the proletariat.
[3:57:18.460 --> 3:57:20.460]  There's always a leader for that.
[3:57:20.460 --> 3:57:21.460]  The central committee.
[3:57:21.460 --> 3:57:22.460]  The central committee.
[3:57:22.460 --> 3:57:26.460]  But the utopia is never working because of the evil group
[3:57:26.460 --> 3:57:27.460]  that still has freedom across the road.
[3:57:27.460 --> 3:57:28.460]  That's right.
[3:57:28.460 --> 3:57:29.460]  So, well, they always have to have an enemy.
[3:57:29.460 --> 3:57:32.460]  So, I think they're drawing this from the idea that the state
[3:57:32.460 --> 3:57:35.460]  somehow will wither away, and then people will live in peace
[3:57:35.460 --> 3:57:38.460]  without any government regulation of any kind.
[3:57:38.460 --> 3:57:42.460]  And it's a myth that's totally contrary to human nature.
[3:57:42.460 --> 3:57:46.460]  Actually, we are going to now go into six, seven minutes of overdrive.
[3:57:46.460 --> 3:57:48.460]  I know I have an important call coming in, too.
[3:57:48.460 --> 3:57:50.460]  So, we'll line that up outside.
[3:57:50.460 --> 3:57:52.460]  G. Evergryphon is our guest.
[3:57:52.460 --> 3:57:54.460]  We'll say bye to the Genesis audience.
[3:57:54.460 --> 3:58:01.460]  Now, he'll be speaking UT campus 8 p.m. to 9.45 p.m. gesture dorm room A121A,
[3:58:01.460 --> 3:58:04.460]  or go to PNAC.
[3:58:04.460 --> 3:58:09.460]  It's PNACitison.org, or Freedom-Force.org.
[3:58:09.460 --> 3:58:12.460]  Tonight, UT 8 p.m. to 9.45 p.m.
[3:58:12.460 --> 3:58:13.460]  I'm out of time.
[3:58:13.460 --> 3:58:14.460]  Be sure and support us.

[3:58:19.460 --> 3:58:23.460]  We now want to go into overdrive on the Internet streams at infowars.com.
[3:58:23.460 --> 3:58:27.460]  Got to go there to hear the last eight minutes at infowars.com.
[3:58:27.460 --> 3:58:30.460]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:30.460 --> 3:58:59.460]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:59:00.460 --> 3:59:04.460]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related
[3:59:04.460 --> 3:59:08.460]  spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[3:59:08.460 --> 3:59:11.460]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with
[3:59:11.460 --> 3:59:15.460]  only two choices, be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.
[3:59:15.460 --> 3:59:19.460]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since Freedom
[3:59:19.460 --> 3:59:23.460]  to Fascism, and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
[3:59:23.460 --> 3:59:25.460]  We invite you to make the change.
