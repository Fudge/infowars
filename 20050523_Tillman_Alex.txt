[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]  A touch on a story that was mentioned very briefly during the Alex Jones program today.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.880]  I think this is very, very telling, and that is Pat Tillman's parents now coming out and
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.440]  speaking actively against George W. Bush and the military that recruited her son.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.440]  He volunteered.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.060]  Now, of course, most of you know Pat Tillman was a star in the National Football League,
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.980]  signed up to make millions of dollars with the Arizona Cardinals, and became the poster
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.860]  boy for recruitment in this international war on terrorism.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.020]  The poster boy for, quote, patriotism, unquote.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.940]  That would be used in the same way, shape, and form as, well, the Patriot Act.
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.300]  That's what we call doublespeak, or newspeak, right out of the book 1984.
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.220]  Former NFL player Pat Tillman was killed roughly just almost a year ago today in Afghanistan.
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.540]  He was a corporal and an Army Ranger fighting in Afghanistan, apparently looking for Osama
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.780]  bin Laden.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.060]  His family is now lashing out against the Army, saying the military's investigations
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.200]  into Tillman's friendly fire death in Afghanistan last year were a sham, and that Army's efforts
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.920]  to cover up the truth have made it harder for them to deal with this loss.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.320]  More than a year after their son was shot several times by fellow Army Rangers in a
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.560]  craggy hillside near the Pakistani border, Tillman's mother and father said in interviews
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.540]  that they believe the military and the government created a heroic tale about how their son
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.780]  died to foster a patriotic response across the country.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.840]  They say that the Army's lies about what happened made them suspicious, and that they are certain
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.040]  they'll never get the full story.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.920]  They say Pat had very high ideals about the country, and that's why he did what he did.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.320]  That's why he went out and refused the millions of dollars and joined the Army to fight the
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.200]  international war on terrorism.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.900]  They say the military let them down.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.480]  The administration let them down.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.680]  They say it was a sign of disrespect.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.960]  The fact that he was the ultimate team player and he watched as his own men killed him is
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.680]  absolutely heartbreaking and tragic.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.640]  The fact that they lied about it afterwards was disgusting.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.400]  Tillman, of course, again, a popular player for the Arizona Cardinals, gave up his stardom
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.400]  to become this Army Ranger.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.200]  Shortly after arriving in the mountains to fight, Tillman was killed in a barrage of
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.320]  gunfire by his own men, mistaken for the enemy as he got in position to defend them.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.680]  Immediately, the Army kept the soldiers on the ground quiet, told Tillman's family and
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.920]  the public that he was killed by enemy fire while storming a hill, barking orders to his
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.280]  fellow Rangers.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.800]  After a public memorial service in which Tillman received the Silver Star, the Army told Tillman's
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.040]  family what really happened, that he'd been killed by his own men.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.520]  Now in separate interviews from their home in San Jose and by telephone, Tillman's parents
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.360]  who were divorced spoke about the ordeal with the Army with simmering frustration and anger.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.600]  A series of military investigations have offered no differing accounts of Tillman's death.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.080]  Most recent report revealed more deeply the confusion and disarray that surrounded the
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.480]  mission he was on.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.640]  The latest investigation written about in the Washington Post earlier this month showed
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.320]  that the soldiers in Afghanistan knew almost immediately they'd killed Tillman by mistake
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.480]  in what they believed was a firefight with enemies on a tight canyon road.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.360]  The investigation also revealed that the soldiers later burned Tillman's uniform and body armor
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.920]  to cover up this malfeasance.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.360]  And I think that Ms. Tillman asks a very interesting question.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.360]  How can an elite Army unit gun down the most recognizable member at such close range?
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.800]  And also if this happens with somebody who is so high profile, if these lies are ingrained
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.800]  and a story is covered up with somebody who is so high profile where it is actually is
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.960]  pretty risky that the truth could come out, what happens to everyone else?
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.080]  How many more cover ups are there like this?
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.560]  Of course, Jessica Lynch was completely blown up and it was revealed that that was a complete
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.360]  farce and a lie in a staged Hollywood production.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.360]  Jessica Lynch on TV last night, extreme makeovers, home edition, now recognizing who the true
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.200]  heroes of that battle were and well, ABC gave about $100,000, $200,000 to the family to
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.280]  rebuild their house as if that's now going to make up for it.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.560]  Private Lynch.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.640]  And if we ask the police, see here's the problem with this lie, even if the record does get
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.260]  straight by the Washington Post and other establishment media organizations that Tillman
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.840]  was killed and that there are some very serious questions here, the first impression is what
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.560]  people remember.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.680]  You know a lot of people still think that Saddam hit us on 9-11.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.200]  They still think that a passport had filtered down through the massive explosion, untouched,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.800]  implicating the 19 Arab hijackers with box cutters.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.400]  I have a couple of more questions here and I'd like to put out a poll and we'll take
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]  some of your calls.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.000]  John Rice coming up from the Neither Party, Deadline Live.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]  All the news you're not supposed to know and more, stay tuned.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]  Suspicious of everyone.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  Take no chances.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]  They were in no free speech.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  Read no free press.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  They were brought up on straight propaganda.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  They have been trained to hate and destroy.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]  Don't argue with them.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]  Don't argue with them.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800]  Don't look them in the eye.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.800]  Be fitter, happier, more productive.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.800]  Not watching too much TV.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.800]  Fitter, happier.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800]  Be good consumers.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800]  Don't question authority.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.800]  Trust your government.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.800]  Yeah, well that's the illusion.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.800]  Welcome back to the show, Deadline Live.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.800]  Jack Blood here with you this Monday.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.800]  Beautiful, beautiful Monday and I'm fired up to start the week here and really go after
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.800]  the New World Order in a hard and fast manner.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.600]  We're talking about this new Pat Tillman revelation where his parents, and I think it's very brave
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.600]  of his parents to speak out against the military because no doubt they could have cashed in
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.600]  on this.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.600]  They could have had their son listed as a big war hero, an icon for future historians
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.600]  for fake history and yet they have chosen to speak out so that American people will
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.600]  know the truth about their son.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.600]  That he was used.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.400]  His mother literally uses that, is offended by how Bush has used her son.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.400]  So I think it's very brave and I want to ask you a few questions.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.400]  We have Alex Jones holding on the line so we'll bring him up.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.400]  But I want to ask you a few questions.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:18.400]  If we put out a poll on CNN or some establishment media monstrosity and we put out a poll asking
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:25.400]  how did poster boy for patriotism, for the international war on terrorism, Corporal Army
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.400]  Ranger Pat Tillman die?
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.200]  A. Heroically fighting Al Qaeda.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.200]  B. Friendly fire in a tragic accident.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.200]  C. Assassinated by his own military.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.200]  Or D. Who's Pat Tillman?
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.200]  Whatever.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.200]  I wonder how most Americans would answer that.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.200]  Well thank God we have people listening, more people every day listening to shows like this
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.200]  who know the score here.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.200]  We have Alex Jones of course from the Alex Jones Show also on GCN.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  Also here in the bunker in Austin, Texas who wants to weigh in on this.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  Alex, thanks for calling in.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  You bet, Jack.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  I got off at 2 o'clock and was driving down the road and now I'm back home and just walking
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  out in the front yard thinking about things you're saying.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]  Do you think it's possible that Pat Tillman saw something he shouldn't have seen?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]  Because he was so idealistic, was maybe going to come back and speak out about what's really
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  going on in Afghanistan, i.e. the poppies, the fake democracy they have over there,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  the killing of women and children and of course state sponsored terrorism and working with
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  the Taliban.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  Maybe that's what he was going to talk about.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  Well Jack, let me just go over first what we know about Jessica Lynch.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  They wanted a poster girl for women in front line combat and so the real people, particularly
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]  one Hispanic man who actually did fight valiantly against overwhelming odds, he was ignored.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]  He was basically called a wimp by the media and Jessica Lynch, you hidden coward, she
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]  was built up as this incredible hero.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]  She finally went public and said it's all theater, it's a fable, it's all made up,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  none of it's true and then now she's done the right thing.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  But listen, in the month before she went public, five people who were in her unit or people
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  involved in saving her died and I mean assassins would pop up over the back fence of their
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  house and double tap them in the head, people would be pulled out of their car and drowned
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  and that clearly was a government hit.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  They were trying to cover that up.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]  Listen, that's admit it, that's mainstream news.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  So then she had to go public just to save her life because it would have been the young
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]  hero died in a car wreck and boy, she was a hero.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]  Now with Pat Tillman, I know for a fact, he was one of my sources that were in Afghanistan.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  He was in a ranger unit, quote, hunting Talamar Al Qaeda and we know that the army, and this
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]  has come out from the troops themselves, higher up command ordered fire down to the area on
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]  that hillside that he was in.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  At first it was he died battling Al Qaeda, then it was okay, it might have been friendly
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  fire.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]  Then they tried to blame it on one of the other ranger units.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]  Now it's coming out that they were ordered to fire on that position and that now with
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  this battlefield computer grids they've got, they knew right where Tillman was at.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  So it's very, very, very suspicious.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  A lot of army rangers, a lot of other people higher up at him, Delta Force, heading on
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  public, one colonel, over how they would quote, have been lauded and targeted and then they
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]  be ordered to stand down and do nothing.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  They even had the top Taliban general in the base in order to release him.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]  Then they flew 8,000 of them out to safety.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]  So I have, it's very, very suspicious.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  And look, when we've been lied to on all these other things and lied to, two different stories
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  on the Tillman case, it really shows that we can't trust anything they're doing.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  So I wouldn't put it past them, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  But let me add this caveat because this is very important.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  When I first covered the Tillman stuff I said, folks, this thing's to high heaven.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]  Then it came out it was a lie.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  I was still being attacked for not being patriotic.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  Now will his parents be attacked for not being patriotic?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  Because they won't believe a lie.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  And Tillman was the type of bleeding heart patriot, a good guy, but misguided, who would
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  have gone public if they weren't really going after the enemy.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]  And I think that that holds a lot of water, Jack.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]  Well, look, I saw Paul Gigot on all of the news channels, all of the Sunday shows, talking
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  about how the media, ever since Vietnam, has had a problem with the military.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  He was talking specifically about the Newsweek.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  No, no, no, here's what he literally said, and this applies to this story as well.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  He said that the media has a problem ever since Vietnam, and just because the military
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  lied a few times doesn't mean that we shouldn't trust them.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  I mean, once the military lies to us once, why should we ever trust them again, Alex?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  Well, bottom line, they took the medals away from the people who deserved them and gave
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  them to somebody that hid under a blanket.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  And when people blew the whistle, they all started getting executed, you know, by top
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]  assassin, you know, type MO.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  And so I guess that's patriotic, too.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  I think that Tillman, as you say, knew that the hunt for bin Laden, the hunt for Al Qaeda
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  was phony.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]  I think he was too idealistic to keep his mouth shut, was probably starting to talk
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  to people, writing things in letters.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  Well, we know they killed Patton.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  We know Patton wanted to go up against the Soviets.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000]  We knew that he was mad about handing over 20,000 of RGIs that were in camps that the
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  Soviets had gotten.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  He was publicly throwing fits, and then he died two days later.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  Well, and we have Paul Wellstone and any number of examples, maybe Vince Foster, people who
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]  likely were going to speak out, who met unfortunate ends, of course our friend Gary Webb being
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  another one of these.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  Well, Ron Brown, yeah, and then people we can trust come out and go, oh, shooting yourself
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  in the head is quite normal.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  You know, twice in the head, well, that's quite easy to do.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]  Look, bottom line, Jack.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]  We will know them by the trail of dead, I believe is the slogan.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  Well, it certainly is, and I, a lot of people listening to the broadcast, I hope people
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]  will visit Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com because it was a month ago or two weeks ago
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]  I started promoting, I'm going to be showing Marshall Law at three different showings here
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  in Austin.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  Well, then my month's almost up.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  We're ten days away from that Friday, June 5th.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]  Yeah, I want to see everybody out there.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]  It's 409 Colorado Street, Alamo Drafthouse.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  That's the third, I believe, Alex, that is this coming Friday, or no, so Friday after
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  next.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]  I'll be there, and I hope everyone else comes out.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]  I hope we have a huge crowd and we have a lot of fun discussing the New World Order.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  That's what it's all about.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]  There'll be a seven and ten o'clock showing, and I'll speak after each event and take questions.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  And then the next week, June 8th, eight o'clock, June 8th, eight o'clock, Alamo Drafthouse,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  South Lamar, one showing, and we'll have longer to speak and take questions after that
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  event because it's only a single showing.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  People ask me which showings are going to be the best.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  All three are going to be wonderful.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  Whatever fits your schedule.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  And, Jack, you'll be on the guest list for all of them if you want to be there, and I
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  appreciate you.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  But I wanted to call in and talk about the Pat Tillman situation and also get a plug
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  out for the three showings because that is rapidly approaching that time.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]  And people can link through at Infowars.com over to the Drafthouse subpage where they
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  can purchase tickets beforehand.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  Got to go, Alex.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  We'll plug that all this week and next week.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]  Take care, my brother.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  Next segment coming up.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  Stay tuned.
