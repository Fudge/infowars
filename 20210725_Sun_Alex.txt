[00:00.000 --> 00:16.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:16.400 --> 00:23.400]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:23.400 --> 00:30.600]  and now your host Owen Troyer that's right sitting in for Alex today and I
[00:30.600 --> 00:39.480]  want to tell you there really is so much news to cover but I'm gonna have to put
[00:39.480 --> 00:47.000]  that on hold for tomorrow where I'll be doing double duty with Alex on the road
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.920]  and I'm hoping that Alex will actually take this vacation and stay away we
[00:51.920 --> 00:55.400]  haven't heard from him yet that's a good sign Alex if you're listening please
[00:55.400 --> 00:59.560]  just enjoy your vacation don't think about the new world order think about a
[00:59.560 --> 01:03.760]  nice juicy steak think about the time with your family and we'll take care of
[01:03.760 --> 01:11.640]  things here in studio and I've got a lot on my mind I got a lot of news but
[01:11.640 --> 01:17.120]  here's the thing I'm gonna put that on hold for tomorrow until tomorrow because
[01:17.120 --> 01:21.920]  we have to get ahead of this next big narrative that the mainstream media is
[01:21.920 --> 01:26.520]  about to push and that we're starting to see already. In fact guys do you have
[01:26.520 --> 01:32.200]  the tweets for me I need that Mayor Adler tweet because according to Steve
[01:32.200 --> 01:38.040]  Adler the mayor of Austin Texas the entire city of Austin is gonna be in the
[01:38.040 --> 01:46.520]  ICU by the end of the month yeah don't take my word for it I've got mayor
[01:46.520 --> 01:55.880]  Adler's tweet right here and he shares the graph and I covered it last week but
[01:55.880 --> 02:01.640]  now I'm seeing the push in the mainstream media which means this is
[02:01.640 --> 02:05.560]  going to be their next big narrative this is going to be their next big push
[02:05.560 --> 02:09.920]  for masks and vaccines and fear mongering and everything is that the
[02:09.920 --> 02:16.040]  hospitals are overwhelmed and it's your fault because you didn't want to take a
[02:16.040 --> 02:20.280]  vaccine even though most of the people that are being admitted to the hospital
[02:20.280 --> 02:25.320]  for COVID have been vaccinated they lie about that too but but so again here
[02:25.320 --> 02:32.200]  was the tweet put out by Mayor Adler last week we can't be finished with a
[02:32.200 --> 02:37.120]  virus that's not finished with us the green line is where we're headed if we
[02:37.120 --> 02:43.040]  all if we don't all comply with my tyranny and it shows hospitalizations I
[02:43.040 --> 02:47.800]  see you not just hospitalizations the ICU look at that green line that's
[02:47.800 --> 02:51.600]  that's what Mayor Adler says will happen if we don't all immediately wear
[02:51.600 --> 02:58.360]  masks 24-7 in the shower in the bedroom in the pool anywhere everywhere and all
[02:58.360 --> 03:01.920]  get vaccinated because the masks don't work and the vaccines don't work so you
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.880]  just got to double down wear 10 masks take 10 vaccines hell just kill
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.960]  yourself really and I guess that's the ultimate irony is I can't catch a COVID
[03:11.960 --> 03:18.680]  virus if I'm dead but so again this is this is this is the graph shared by
[03:18.680 --> 03:22.480]  Mayor Adler he says everybody in the city of Austin is gonna be in the ICU by
[03:22.480 --> 03:27.640]  the end of the month if we don't all wear masks and take vaccines and I
[03:27.640 --> 03:31.560]  started to see a little bit in the media pushing this but but that just means I
[03:31.560 --> 03:37.080]  think next week or the week after they'll probably plan it out maybe with two
[03:37.080 --> 03:41.320]  weeks or a month before they think they're gonna have FDA authorization if
[03:41.320 --> 03:46.160]  they have confidence in that happening of the vaccine so that they can mandate
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.520]  it because that's their ultimate plan so the current game plan for this tyranny
[03:51.520 --> 03:58.200]  is bring back the fear-mongering bring back the lockdowns bring back the masks
[03:58.200 --> 04:03.760]  tell everybody they're gonna die if they don't take a vaccine or wear a mask and
[04:03.760 --> 04:07.840]  then once they get the FDA approval for the vaccine that's when they're gonna
[04:07.840 --> 04:12.760]  mandate it and this is all gonna happen most likely within the next two months
[04:12.760 --> 04:18.000]  maybe even one month but here's what I want to do today and I'm gonna I'm gonna
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.400]  come back in the next segment get out the phone number because I'm gonna I'm
[04:21.400 --> 04:25.560]  gonna put all the news aside today not easy for me to do because it's a lot of
[04:25.560 --> 04:28.000]  important developments but we're gonna cover it all tomorrow and the rest of
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.680]  the week I'm gonna open up the phone lines today exclusively to health care
[04:31.680 --> 04:37.440]  workers are your hospitals filled because I saw multiple news stories
[04:37.440 --> 04:41.200]  throughout the week and doctors on Twitter verified doctors you've never
[04:41.200 --> 04:45.280]  heard of saying the hospital's overwhelmed people are waiting 48 hours to
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.280]  get in we don't have medicine anymore the outbreak is out of control
[04:49.280 --> 04:53.000]  remember just like they did last year and then we did the same thing for days
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.280]  and everybody said no the hospitals are empty so let's get out ahead of that
[04:57.280 --> 05:00.240]  false narrative tonight
[05:00.800 --> 05:07.280]  there's one central fact of criminal psychology the criminologist all agree
[05:07.280 --> 05:12.560]  on and that it's criminals aren't extremely pathological even more the
[05:12.560 --> 05:16.400]  general public they do the same things over and over again and criminals like
[05:16.400 --> 05:22.240]  to commit the same types of crimes over and over again well guess what it was
[05:22.240 --> 05:29.440]  Anthony Fauci and you Genesis globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the
[05:29.440 --> 05:32.400]  mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more
[05:32.400 --> 05:37.840]  people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[05:37.840 --> 05:41.240]  that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create auto
[05:41.240 --> 05:46.760]  immune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then break down and
[05:46.760 --> 05:51.120]  would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out the COVID-19
[05:51.120 --> 05:54.720]  and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your
[05:54.720 --> 05:58.960]  immune system basically giving you the equivalent of HIV that's right ladies
[05:58.960 --> 06:13.200]  and gentlemen
[06:13.920 --> 06:20.800]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[06:20.800 --> 06:25.520]  and now your host owin treuer
[06:25.520 --> 06:33.320]  how could you conquer the world without firing a single shot without dropping a
[06:33.320 --> 06:41.640]  single bomb well you would manufacture a virus in a lab have it get out of that
[06:41.640 --> 06:48.760]  lab and then have the mainstream media run fear-mongering campaigns for months
[06:48.760 --> 06:54.320]  or years however long it takes over that virus until everyone was
[06:54.320 --> 07:00.440]  capitulated you could bring in a one-world government through it medical
[07:00.440 --> 07:04.560]  tyranny through it and then once you have the mandated vaccines you have
[07:04.560 --> 07:15.480]  conquered the planet that is the current globalist plan that we are under right
[07:15.480 --> 07:22.960]  now total capitulation of every human being on earth because of a COVID virus
[07:22.960 --> 07:29.440]  manufactured in a Chinese military lab with the aid of Anthony Fauci with the
[07:29.440 --> 07:34.360]  aid of Barack Obama with the aid of Bill Gates and they all know it they've
[07:34.360 --> 07:38.720]  all been caught and I guess they're just hoping that the whole planet will
[07:38.720 --> 07:45.680]  capitulate soon enough that they'll have their world regime with medical
[07:45.680 --> 07:50.640]  tyranny in place before we could ever get justice against Anthony Fauci and
[07:50.640 --> 07:55.440]  everybody else involved in that Wuhan lab this is the Alex Jones show we are
[07:55.440 --> 07:59.400]  live in the Info Wars World headquarters on this Sunday July 25th Alex is on
[07:59.400 --> 08:07.800]  vacation I'm hoping that he can actually take a vacation this time and I'm gonna be
[08:07.800 --> 08:11.960]  putting off all of the news today for tomorrow and the rest of this week
[08:11.960 --> 08:18.840]  because specifically today we have to get out ahead of the next big narrative
[08:18.840 --> 08:22.960]  which is that the hospitals are overwhelmed there's no hospital beds
[08:22.960 --> 08:26.680]  left there's no medicine left it's basically total dire straits at every
[08:26.680 --> 08:34.920]  hospital in America COVID's back Delta's back everybody's dying and again they
[08:34.920 --> 08:39.480]  haven't they haven't launched the full push yet but there's been some
[08:39.480 --> 08:47.040]  preliminary pushes for example from our piece of absolute garbage in fact
[08:47.040 --> 08:51.400]  garbage has more use than our mayor Steve Adler at least you can incinerate
[08:51.400 --> 08:55.640]  garbage and you know maybe there's something you can do with it Adler has
[08:55.640 --> 09:01.080]  no use this guy sucks and the funny thing is you go to every single one of
[09:01.080 --> 09:04.440]  his tweets it's nothing but negative reviews I don't know how this guy
[09:04.440 --> 09:09.920]  continues to get in office except all of our elections are rigged but so I saw
[09:09.920 --> 09:14.600]  some I saw a couple news reports from over the weekend I saw a couple verified
[09:14.600 --> 09:18.080]  doctors on Twitter saying that there isn't an empty hospital bed in America
[09:18.080 --> 09:24.160]  right now Delta's killing us all which to me just means this is going to be their
[09:24.160 --> 09:26.960]  next big narrative this is going to be their next big push it's coming in a
[09:26.960 --> 09:33.360]  week it's coming in two weeks just like they did I guess it was really over a
[09:33.360 --> 09:37.320]  year ago but they kind of did it all of the summer of 2020 saying hospitals are
[09:37.320 --> 09:41.320]  overwhelmed ICU's overwhelmed there's no hospital beds there's no medicine you're
[09:41.320 --> 09:46.520]  waiting 48 hours to just to get in most people are being rejected and so for an
[09:46.520 --> 09:51.040]  entire week we took calls from health care workers I went to three different
[09:51.040 --> 10:00.000]  hospitals in Austin and they were ghost towns you could hear a pin drop I filmed
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.200]  it all others went out to the same thing for a whole week we did this we took
[10:04.200 --> 10:07.680]  calls for a whole week others filmed it it was a it was a viral sensation on the
[10:07.680 --> 10:10.780]  internet of people going to the hospitals walking in saying where is the
[10:10.780 --> 10:15.520]  overwhelmed hospital where's all the people waiting all of them ghost towns
[10:15.520 --> 10:19.920]  everywhere and then security comes and rushes them up rushes them out hushes
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.440]  them up because well we can't expose the false narrative so I want to get ahead
[10:24.440 --> 10:27.520]  of this false narrative today and I want to take calls from health care workers
[10:27.520 --> 10:34.520]  for the entire show from across America or hell if you're overseas are you
[10:34.520 --> 10:41.520]  seeing another push or are are your is your hospital overwhelmed is your
[10:41.520 --> 10:45.880]  hospital crowded are people waiting 48 hours to get inside are people being
[10:45.880 --> 10:49.360]  turned down because there's no beds are people being turned down because it's
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.840]  too crowded too busy there's no doctors are the nurses getting all limbered and
[10:54.840 --> 10:59.720]  stretching for their new dance routines I mean this is how ridiculous it is they
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.920]  claim the hospitals are so overwhelmed yet all you saw from nurses was dance
[11:03.920 --> 11:07.960]  routines and they think we're so stupid that we won't even put two and two
[11:07.960 --> 11:12.440]  together like hey you say the hospitals are overwhelmed but all you're doing is
[11:12.440 --> 11:21.140]  dancing for tiktok videos remember they sent the Navy ships the big ginormous
[11:21.140 --> 11:26.640]  Navy ships and not a single patient not a single COVID patient went on them not
[11:26.640 --> 11:38.880]  a one so this is what we're gonna do today I want to go for the entire Sunday
[11:38.880 --> 11:43.920]  Alex Jones show taking calls from health care workers specifically is your
[11:43.920 --> 11:47.880]  hospital overwhelmed are people being pushed out are people waiting out the
[11:47.880 --> 11:53.640]  door is there a 48 hour wait or is this just yet another lie of the mainstream
[11:53.640 --> 11:58.680]  media another lie of what I guess are just Democrat doctors because remember
[11:58.680 --> 12:04.040]  Democrat the Democrats that are members of the media have completely sold out
[12:04.040 --> 12:08.080]  their profession they're no longer reporters they're no longer journalists
[12:08.080 --> 12:12.000]  they're no longer truth tellers they are full-blown activists for the Democrat
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.040]  Party they cover up the Hunter Biden laptop they cover up Joe Biden's
[12:16.040 --> 12:22.080]  dementia I can go on so just like reporters and journalists have completely
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.000]  sold out their profession for the Democrat Party now you're seeing doctors
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  doing the same thing nurses doing the same thing and you know that hurts even
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.520]  worse we're used to the media in this country being totally corrupt that's
[12:37.520 --> 12:42.520]  why info wars exists that's why despite all the censorship info wars is still on
[12:42.520 --> 12:46.560]  air because we're necessary and people fund us because they know we're needed
[12:46.560 --> 12:53.720]  in this time of fake news but boy oh boy you'd think you could at least have some
[12:53.720 --> 12:56.640]  integrity in the health care profession have doctors that don't want to be
[12:56.640 --> 13:00.240]  liars but guess what I guess Democrats no matter what profession they're in
[13:00.240 --> 13:04.240]  they're liars whether they're doctors whether they're nurses whether they're
[13:04.240 --> 13:07.760]  reporters whether they're teachers they've all sold out to the Democrat Party
[13:07.760 --> 13:14.080]  cult they've all sold out to the death cult and they don't give a damn what it
[13:14.080 --> 13:18.640]  does to their profession so now I can't believe I'm saying I'm heartbroken at
[13:18.640 --> 13:23.960]  this doctors are now selling out their profession for the Democrat Party and
[13:23.960 --> 13:27.520]  they're gonna start pushing the false narrative that the hospitals are
[13:27.520 --> 13:31.720]  overwhelmed from Delta and COVID because you didn't get vaccinated how
[13:31.720 --> 13:38.400]  disgusting yeah here's the overwhelmed hospitals last summer guys yeah we're
[13:38.400 --> 13:43.600]  curing COVID yeah we're overwhelmed here let's get it let's get our COVID dance
[13:43.600 --> 13:54.880]  routine home this is a cult so they're gonna bring it back they're gonna bring
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.920]  it back and they're gonna tell you hospitals are overwhelmed from Delta
[13:57.920 --> 14:00.680]  just like they lied last year and said they were overwhelmed from COVID while
[14:00.680 --> 14:06.560]  they all danced on tiktok with choreographed dance routines I wish I
[14:06.560 --> 14:11.120]  had time to choreograph a dance routine boy crew wouldn't that be nice wouldn't
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.280]  that be nice if things slowed down in the info war and we could choreograph the
[14:15.280 --> 14:20.680]  dance routine for Twitter wouldn't that be fun guys that would be great how we
[14:20.680 --> 14:26.960]  don't even have time to take a day off if we're sick oh but those nurses are so
[14:26.960 --> 14:33.440]  overwhelmed making more money than they've ever made to dance on on tiktok so
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.760]  I want to get out ahead of this false narrative again Steve Adler the mayor of
[14:37.760 --> 14:41.760]  Austin says every person in Austin is gonna be in an ICU by the end of the
[14:41.760 --> 14:50.000]  month I mean that is so insane so ludicrous and and he has the gall to
[14:50.000 --> 14:58.080]  actually make that a public statement get him off my screen what a piece of
[14:58.080 --> 15:06.960]  absolute shiitake mushrooms God he sucks you Democrats you just you just you're
[15:06.960 --> 15:13.640]  the worst people on earth man like I've got a video I'm not even gonna have time
[15:13.640 --> 15:19.200]  to get to it today there was a rally in New York City you know justice for
[15:19.200 --> 15:23.240]  Ashley Babbitt justice for the political prisoners from January 6th the Democrat
[15:23.240 --> 15:28.200]  Party and Antifa decides to show up and and throw water at people and assault
[15:28.200 --> 15:33.320]  people and the cops just stand by and let them do it instead of moving in and
[15:33.320 --> 15:36.840]  just smashing their skulls like the scum they are they just sit there they just
[15:36.840 --> 15:46.280]  let them torture people in the streets it just makes me sick and yeah boy oh boy
[15:46.280 --> 15:50.360]  so when we come back I'm gonna get out the phone number for healthcare workers
[15:50.360 --> 15:54.680]  only are you seeing your hospital is overwhelmed or is it just like last
[15:54.680 --> 16:00.040]  summer when they lied about it and the hospitals were completely empty as we
[16:00.040 --> 16:03.960]  predicted the globalist are now launching a new lockdown the first one
[16:03.960 --> 16:07.680]  has already destroyed the third world already caused over 20 million extra
[16:07.680 --> 16:10.880]  people to starve to death and it's caused massive supply chain problems
[16:10.880 --> 16:14.800]  across the Western world ladies and gentlemen now is the time for you to

[17:09.640 --> 17:15.000]  of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure so I get to see
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.880]  things the general public doesn't get to see and let me tell you whether it's

[20:25.680 --> 20:35.360]  and now your host Owen Troyer. Alright I'm gonna take calls from health care
[20:35.360 --> 20:40.520]  workers for the rest of this transmission and then I've been told we have a
[20:40.520 --> 20:43.680]  special report coming up from Alex Jones we're gonna air it at the end of
[20:43.680 --> 20:49.360]  today's transmission as well but for the next hour and a half I want to take
[20:49.360 --> 20:57.400]  calls specifically from health care workers are your hospitals overwhelmed
[20:57.400 --> 21:03.040]  are or is the media lying just like they did last summer to drum up the fear
[21:03.040 --> 21:07.360]  and and here's the next level of the fear mongering that nobody really talks
[21:07.360 --> 21:13.720]  about but it's very apparent and if there is some sort of an influx at at
[21:13.720 --> 21:20.440]  hospitals this is why there's this the new brainwashing propaganda is that oh
[21:20.440 --> 21:25.520]  if you get sick you're dead you're just dead that's it for you you've got a
[21:25.520 --> 21:29.080]  virus you're dead your cup puts that's it you don't have an immune system you
[21:29.080 --> 21:32.880]  can't recover there's no medicine that can help you're just dead so you better
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.760]  get the vaccine otherwise you're dead if you get a virus yeah exactly oh boy I
[21:38.760 --> 21:41.240]  don't even want to go back into that story it's one of the sickest things you
[21:41.240 --> 21:45.680]  ever seen I'm telling you man the these liberal progressive Democrats are
[21:45.680 --> 21:51.640]  really reaching next level of demonic possession when they're just they got
[21:51.640 --> 21:54.880]  somebody in that hospital bed and they're ready to murder them they're
[21:54.880 --> 22:00.880]  ready to murder them by putting them on a ventilator and they love it they get
[22:00.880 --> 22:05.280]  joy out of it and they write stories about how much they love it like yeah
[22:05.280 --> 22:10.640]  I'm too late for you you're dead and they go in with that ventilator I've
[22:10.640 --> 22:18.760]  got another COVID death count now and they love it you know you don't want to
[22:18.760 --> 22:23.440]  talk bad about our health care workers and our doctors because they're some of
[22:23.440 --> 22:27.240]  the best amongst us but we got to be honest about what's happening the same
[22:27.240 --> 22:30.800]  phenomenon we've seen in the media with Democrats in the media completely
[22:30.800 --> 22:34.760]  selling out the truth for the Democrat Party now you're seeing Democrats in the
[22:34.760 --> 22:39.560]  health care field are doing the exact same thing and I'm sorry to say but it's
[22:39.560 --> 22:46.000]  true a Democrat doctor is now willing to lie about COVID lie about hospitals and
[22:46.000 --> 22:53.840]  a lie about a vaccine really tragic but that's where we are and and I've got the
[22:53.840 --> 22:59.200]  10 stages of genocide right here and we'll show you where the Democrat Party
[22:59.200 --> 23:04.480]  is out on it right now you better watch out the Democrat Party is at stage 8 out
[23:04.480 --> 23:08.960]  of the 10 stages of Democrat democide excuse me genocide of democide yes I
[23:08.960 --> 23:15.000]  Democrat genocide they are on stage 8 right now ladies and gentlemen
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.360]  persecution beginning of murders Ashley Babbitt theft of property I mean
[23:20.360 --> 23:26.200]  where'd even go Roger Stone Rudy Giuliani trial massacres yeah look at all
[23:26.200 --> 23:30.720]  the January 6 people being held without bail they're on stage 8 you know what
[23:30.720 --> 23:38.640]  stage 9 is extermination and when you've got Democrat doctors willing to lie
[23:38.640 --> 23:41.640]  about what's happening in this country right now when it comes to hospitals and
[23:41.640 --> 23:47.280]  health we're in big big trouble oh and by the way I've got this here's your old
[23:47.280 --> 23:52.160]  school Nazi propaganda I'm telling you man you'd almost think the Nazis are
[23:52.160 --> 23:55.400]  running the Democrat Party at this point I'm not even kidding you here's your old
[23:55.400 --> 24:00.920]  Nazi propaganda where they show Jews as maggots and Jewish people with maggots
[24:00.920 --> 24:04.280]  crawling all over them this was the propaganda the Nazis put out against the
[24:04.280 --> 24:08.120]  Jews look at the propaganda Democrats are putting out against Trump supporters
[24:08.120 --> 24:11.760]  here's a maggot so there are maggots right there and then here's a Trump
[24:11.760 --> 24:16.400]  supporter covered in maggots and bugs the exact same propaganda the Nazis used
[24:16.400 --> 24:20.800]  against the Jews so what do you think they're gonna do to us next guys oh it's
[24:20.800 --> 24:26.520]  a mystery I can't figure it out Owen what do the Democrats have planned for us
[24:27.040 --> 24:31.320]  well if they can't arrest all of us they'll kill all of us and they'll feel
[24:31.320 --> 24:37.640]  great about it oh and by the way yes the vaccine does kill people even if it's
[24:37.640 --> 24:41.800]  rare it does kill people so if you forced me to take a vaccine that's
[24:41.800 --> 24:47.920]  attempted murder how does that feel all of you out there pushing the vaccine to
[24:47.920 --> 24:56.320]  be guilty of attempted murder must be nice so without further ado the phone
[24:56.320 --> 25:01.880]  number guys put it on the screen I want to make sure I get it right 877-789-2539
[25:01.880 --> 25:09.360]  877-789-2539 healthcare workers nurses doctors anybody that works in a
[25:09.360 --> 25:15.560]  hospital or has friends or family that work in hospital 877-789-2539 are the
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.040]  hospitals overwhelmed are the ICU beds overwhelmed are the hospitals just
[25:20.040 --> 25:24.040]  complex shutting down they don't know what to do 48 hour wait times nobody can
[25:24.040 --> 25:28.520]  get in just like they claimed last summer or is it just yet another lie of
[25:28.520 --> 25:32.880]  the mainstream media and the Democrat Party because this is going to be their
[25:32.880 --> 25:36.760]  next narrative hospitals are overwhelmed it's your fault you're not
[25:36.760 --> 25:43.600]  vaccinated FDA approval of the vaccine mandate the vaccine the that's that's
[25:43.600 --> 25:48.360]  the phase and the three stages of this phase that we're in right now when it
[25:48.360 --> 25:53.040]  comes to this global medical tyranny so again healthcare workers or family and
[25:53.040 --> 25:56.160]  friends of healthcare workers that can answer this question let's get out ahead
[25:56.160 --> 25:59.440]  of this narrative because I'm telling you it's where they're going next are the
[25:59.440 --> 26:03.480]  hospitals overwhelmed or is it yet another lie of the mainstream media yeah
[26:03.480 --> 26:06.120]  I mean the crew could probably start pulling up some of the stories that have
[26:06.120 --> 26:11.640]  been developing this month but they haven't done their full push they've
[26:11.640 --> 26:15.880]  just been kind of getting you ready for it greasing the skids priming the pumps
[26:15.880 --> 26:19.160]  but eventually they're just gonna come out and it's gonna be the same thing as
[26:19.160 --> 26:22.880]  last year oh the hospitals are totally overwhelmed it's the worst thing we've
[26:22.880 --> 26:26.960]  ever seen at the hospitals it's total chaos 48 hour waits nobody can even get
[26:26.960 --> 26:31.760]  in doctors working seven days a week no breaks nurses falling over from their
[26:31.760 --> 26:37.520]  dance routines or will it just be another lie like they did last year and it
[26:37.520 --> 26:41.280]  doesn't matter like last year when we had I mean what hundreds thousands of
[26:41.280 --> 26:44.360]  people going to their local hospitals filming that they were totally empty
[26:44.360 --> 26:47.880]  totally ghost towns didn't stop the mainstream media from lying about it
[26:47.880 --> 26:51.520]  didn't didn't stop liberal progressive Democrats from believing the big lies
[26:51.520 --> 26:55.800]  no they still with went went with it because that's what liars do that's
[26:55.800 --> 27:02.200]  what criminals do that's what brainwashed cults do and man oh man you
[27:02.200 --> 27:07.000]  never thought you'd see the day where doctors and nurses healthcare workers
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.240]  should be the most uplifted some of them uplifted among us would sell out the
[27:13.240 --> 27:18.520]  truth sell out their profession for the Democrat Party agenda and narrative the
[27:18.520 --> 27:25.200]  globalist the conquering of the world agenda but they're doing it so just get

[33:31.080 --> 33:36.520]  telling you there is so much news breaking that is devastating to the
[33:36.520 --> 33:40.440]  globalist if you can only get out there but I'm gonna have to put it all on hold
[33:40.440 --> 33:45.540]  till tomorrow because I want to get out ahead of their next big narrative which
[33:45.540 --> 33:50.760]  is that the hospitals are overwhelmed because people are unvaccinated and from
[33:50.760 --> 33:56.920]  for for I mean I'm just gonna bet on history repeating itself that just like
[33:56.920 --> 33:59.880]  last summer when they said the hospitals were overwhelmed and I went to the
[33:59.880 --> 34:02.160]  three hospitals in Austin that they claimed were overwhelmed they were all
[34:02.160 --> 34:06.360]  ghost towns we did full weeks of coverage taking calls from not just
[34:06.360 --> 34:09.040]  healthcare workers but people who went in and filmed their own hospitals that
[34:09.040 --> 34:15.080]  were totally ghost towns you could hear a pin drop we can't let them get away
[34:15.080 --> 34:19.400]  with these big lies to bring in global tyranny medical tyranny and that's the
[34:19.400 --> 34:24.760]  agenda here so we're gonna go to the phone lines now again we're talking to
[34:24.760 --> 34:31.840]  healthcare workers are your hospitals overwhelmed by new COVID or Delta cases I
[34:31.840 --> 34:36.760]  mean I could be saying are they unvaccinated but we already have the
[34:36.760 --> 34:42.480]  data on that most of the new COVID or Delta variant admissions into the
[34:42.480 --> 34:48.000]  hospitals are vaccinated people about 70 to 80 percent depends on depends on
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.240]  what age group it's about 70 to 80 percent vaccinated people go into the
[34:52.240 --> 34:56.400]  hospital and you know it's the same ridiculous notion that just proves
[34:56.400 --> 35:03.400]  they're such liars if you're vaccinated why are you afraid if it protects you if
[35:03.400 --> 35:06.480]  it's safe and effective and you're vaccinated then what are you so afraid
[35:06.480 --> 35:10.320]  of if you're wearing your mask what are you so afraid of it's all propaganda
[35:10.320 --> 35:15.520]  they've bought into the cult sad to say they've bought in the cult so we start
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.880]  with Jerry has called in from Pennsylvania Jerry you're on the Alex
[35:19.880 --> 35:25.760]  Jones show go ahead hey Owen how are you hey Jerry what are you seeing you
[35:25.760 --> 35:29.320]  said you're a sales it's a sales guy in a hospital what are you seeing in the
[35:29.320 --> 35:36.120]  hospitals in Pennsylvania yep scranton Pennsylvania I go to the ORs all the
[35:36.120 --> 35:42.000]  time but they were talking about out in the doctor's lounge last week zero
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.080]  cases are in the hospital on it's the designated COVID hospital oh so it's a
[35:47.080 --> 35:51.000]  whole hospital dedicated dedicated to COVID and it's and it's empty no no no
[35:51.000 --> 35:57.560]  there's three hospitals in scranton out of the three it is where the the location
[35:57.560 --> 36:04.280]  where they would take you if you were a COVID patient and there was zero so the
[36:04.280 --> 36:10.600]  hospitals are empty gotcha in scranton yes Joe Joe Biden's supposed at home
[36:10.600 --> 36:18.040]  town which is another right right right the scranton kid yeah total baloney by
[36:18.040 --> 36:21.160]  the way I've got a clip from Joe Biden I'll play before the end of the day this
[36:21.160 --> 36:25.520]  is gonna make you laugh so hard you may urinate yourself I'm not even kidding
[36:25.520 --> 36:31.600]  you of all no no I'm serious of all the Joe Biden flummoxes and fumbles and
[36:31.600 --> 36:37.480]  bumbles he's gone to new lengths in fact I may even issue a challenge I got to
[36:37.480 --> 36:41.840]  focus on the on the issue today but I mean if anybody can translate what Joe
[36:41.840 --> 36:47.320]  Biden says in this video clip I mean it's like you deserve an award I mean he
[36:47.320 --> 36:52.200]  needs a translator but we'll we'll do it radio tease we'll do that later anything
[36:52.200 --> 36:58.360]  else Jerry yeah could I say one other thing not related to the sure make it
[36:58.360 --> 37:02.880]  quick because I gotta get health care workers on the air yep Joe Biden you
[37:02.880 --> 37:07.040]  know he does say he's from scranton which is total nonsense I mean he might
[37:07.040 --> 37:12.080]  have come here back and forth with it his parents to his grandparents to visit
[37:12.080 --> 37:19.400]  but not from here but the day before the election he he was here 12 people came
[37:19.400 --> 37:27.760]  to see him 12 well yeah well Donald Trump came and there's a back road from
[37:27.760 --> 37:33.440]  the airport down into a small town by the name of old forge and there's a
[37:33.440 --> 37:38.240]  company there by the name of Mariotti lumber but lining the road on the back
[37:38.240 --> 37:45.080]  road there had to be 80 90,000 people signed there's no way he lost Lackawanna
[37:45.080 --> 37:50.240]  County in Pennsylvania and there's no way Joe Biden won his hometown yeah
[37:50.240 --> 37:53.640]  there's no way Joe Biden got 80 million votes let alone 70 million votes and
[37:53.640 --> 37:57.480]  they caught I mean they literally been caught they got caught now with the
[37:57.480 --> 38:01.000]  audits in Georgia and Arizona if we have audits in Michigan that are that are
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.960]  statewide and Wisconsin and in Pennsylvania it'll it'll turn out Trump
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.320]  actually won the election by landslide and so of course that's why the
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.280]  Democrats are doing everything they can to fight those audits hey one other
[38:14.280 --> 38:19.360]  thing on the COVID sales representatives like myself and I've been doing this for
[38:19.360 --> 38:25.680]  close to 30 years we have to swipe our we get a card it's a credentialing card
[38:25.680 --> 38:31.680]  either simpler vendor mate it depends what area you're in but it's tied to the
[38:31.680 --> 38:37.320]  government and they're talking about adding the vaccine to that card so
[38:37.320 --> 38:41.520]  everybody who's within the medical industry who has to go into the hospital
[38:41.520 --> 38:47.920]  is going to be forced to get that or you're gonna be out of job after 29
[38:47.920 --> 38:51.560]  years yeah they're just they're just rolling out all the medical tyranny right
[38:51.560 --> 38:56.360]  now it's all coming absolutely Jerry thank you so much for the phone call
[38:56.360 --> 39:03.080]  let's go to James in Long Beach a health care worker James you're on the Alex
[39:03.080 --> 39:08.360]  Jones show go ahead hey good afternoon only this is James howdy anyway long
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.000]  time listener first-time caller always wanted to say that I'm there there you
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.080]  know it's true oh it's true there are empty beds in California I don't believe
[39:17.080 --> 39:21.520]  the narrative I was telling your call screener you know I work in a 59 bed
[39:21.520 --> 39:27.400]  facility we only have 40 patients that's what almost 20 empty beds we haven't
[39:27.400 --> 39:31.960]  had a COVID patient in our hospital since probably February and that was a
[39:31.960 --> 39:36.000]  post COVID you know that somebody that got sick survived it ended up you know in
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.600]  our hospital you know and the other thing I was gonna try and tell her but
[39:40.600 --> 39:45.360]  I'll tell you is you know I was an eyewitness to what really killed these
[39:45.360 --> 39:49.920]  people last year yeah some of it was improper ventilator usage another part
[39:49.920 --> 39:54.240]  of it was just poor nursing care and then we have we also have staffing issues
[39:54.240 --> 39:58.480]  because when it up happening us a lot of our nurses went out of state for big
[39:58.480 --> 40:02.800]  cash bonuses they went to your state Texas was a primary target they get
[40:02.800 --> 40:07.800]  $10,000 up front put up in a hotel foods type in and why would you stay in
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.560]  California for peanuts when you can go to Texas for you know state you know what
[40:11.560 --> 40:15.480]  I'm saying well and I'm glad that you mentioned that too because I mean I feel
[40:15.480 --> 40:19.520]  that I'm fortunate enough I can rely on my immune system but I was pretty sick
[40:19.520 --> 40:24.400]  over this weekend still kind of recovering a little bit but you know it
[40:24.400 --> 40:27.840]  took me two days maybe maybe you could say three to beat this thing whatever it
[40:27.840 --> 40:30.920]  was I had I think I was just I think I was just fatigued to my immune system
[40:30.920 --> 40:36.480]  shut down but but nonetheless the point is you know I I'd like a situation where
[40:36.480 --> 40:41.480]  if I get sick that I feel like okay I can go to the hospital or go to a doctor
[40:41.480 --> 40:44.160]  and yeah you know what they're gonna prescribe me something that's gonna make
[40:44.160 --> 40:47.440]  me better I could maybe get some Ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or
[40:47.440 --> 40:50.600]  something that they know is gonna help you beat this thing in 24 hours but
[40:50.600 --> 40:54.600]  that's not the case that's not the case so it's like why would I even go to a
[40:54.600 --> 40:58.160]  doctor why would I even go to the hospital when I can just lay on my bed for
[40:58.160 --> 41:01.800]  48 hours and beat this thing not everybody may have the immune system to
[41:01.800 --> 41:05.840]  do that but but isn't that even that's exactly what you're saying though is
[41:05.840 --> 41:12.120]  like I can't even go to a doctor or go to a hospital to get proper care because
[41:12.120 --> 41:14.920]  they won't even give you hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin which has
[41:14.920 --> 41:19.560]  been proven to work through that you know I would tell people hospitals are
[41:19.560 --> 41:23.600]  probably some of the most dangerous places anybody can go to you know they
[41:23.600 --> 41:27.120]  could drop you out of a bed and kill you they can give you the wrong medication
[41:27.120 --> 41:30.480]  and kill you they can give you an additional infection and kill you and
[41:30.480 --> 41:33.400]  if you're laying that bed long enough you're probably catch a bed sore you
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.160]  know which is what I specialize in but um yeah it is kind of a sad story state of
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.400]  affairs to be honest with you Owen you know I've been in nurse 32 years I've
[41:42.400 --> 41:48.160]  seen a lot and what I saw in the last year was sad just that's the only that's
[41:48.160 --> 41:52.720]  the first word our grandchildren's children are gonna look back on this
[41:52.720 --> 41:57.480]  generation and go what a bunch of knuckleheads and cowards oh my god you
[41:57.480 --> 42:01.760]  know what I'm saying I think a lot of people feel that way you know when I
[42:01.760 --> 42:06.080]  articulate that to my co-workers and a lot of them are still scared we have
[42:06.080 --> 42:10.640]  co-workers I'm not even kidding double mask wearing gloves at all times with the
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.160]  face visor and we haven't had a COVID patient in six months and they walk
[42:14.160 --> 42:18.720]  around outside like that we're just signaling so you know the people around
[42:18.720 --> 42:22.000]  the area look you down and say oh that's the place must be loudly with COVID we
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.840]  haven't had any you know we've had a postpone surgeries because you know we
[42:26.840 --> 42:30.840]  can use the OR due to COVID which was ridiculous you know so you know that's
[42:30.840 --> 42:34.160]  probably another reason why people died was because they weren't able to get
[42:34.160 --> 42:40.760]  surgeries they were in cancer treatment oh yeah oh yeah that last year it was back and and now
[42:40.760 --> 42:44.200]  they have the Olympics which is nothing more than a propaganda tool it's not
[42:44.200 --> 42:46.680]  even about the Olympics anymore it's about hey let's use the Olympics to
[42:46.680 --> 42:50.480]  propagandize people and they're making all the athletes wear masks and it's
[42:50.480 --> 42:53.400]  like you can tell that half the athletes know it's the dumbest thing ever they
[42:53.400 --> 42:57.360]  keep it below their nose some TV person says put it above your nose put it above
[42:57.360 --> 43:05.040]  your nose it's ridiculous there's one central fact of criminal psychology the
[43:05.040 --> 43:10.600]  criminologist all agree on and that its criminals are extremely pathological
[43:10.600 --> 43:14.840]  even more the general public they do the same things over and over again and
[43:14.840 --> 43:20.720]  criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again well guess
[43:20.720 --> 43:27.120]  what it was Anthony Fauci and Eugenice's globalist that ran the rollout
[43:27.120 --> 43:31.240]  of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually
[43:31.240 --> 43:35.520]  killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research
[43:35.520 --> 43:39.360]  of viruses that would actually go attack the telenphysites in the body and
[43:39.360 --> 43:44.440]  create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then
[43:44.440 --> 43:49.320]  break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.360]  out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine
[43:53.360 --> 43:57.680]  destroys your immune system basically giving you the equivalent of HIV that's
[43:57.680 --> 44:01.640]  right ladies and gentlemen as we predicted the globalist are now
[44:01.640 --> 44:05.920]  launching a new lockdown the first one has already destroyed the third world
[44:05.920 --> 44:09.360]  already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death and it's
[44:09.360 --> 44:13.520]  caused massive supply chain problems across the western world ladies and

[47:31.720 --> 47:35.640]  we're back here live on the Alex Jones show we're taking phone calls from
[47:35.640 --> 47:41.360]  healthcare workers are the hospitals overwhelmed from COVID or Delta patients
[47:41.360 --> 47:47.200]  like the mainstream false narrative push is beginning to say and they're gonna
[47:47.200 --> 47:50.160]  really force that out probably about two weeks before they think they're gonna
[47:50.160 --> 47:55.240]  get the FDA approval so that they could really feel justified when they mandate
[47:55.240 --> 48:00.840]  you take that deadly vaccine that's attempted murder you want to force me to
[48:00.840 --> 48:09.480]  take a vaccine that kills people that's attempted murder but yes we live in the
[48:09.480 --> 48:14.800]  world of medical tyranny now and Democrat liberal progressives have just
[48:14.800 --> 48:20.960]  fully sold out their entire beliefs now they love big government now they love
[48:20.960 --> 48:29.520]  big pharma oh it's so good give me the big pharmaceutical tyranny give me the
[48:29.520 --> 48:35.320]  big global government tyranny please please oh there's too many humans anyway
[48:35.320 --> 48:41.640]  and Bill Gates says that we can we can solve that problem with vaccines so I
[48:41.640 --> 48:44.960]  think we should trust Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci who's the number one paid
[48:44.960 --> 48:52.000]  government official to vaccinate us all to death oh there's the latest numbers
[48:52.000 --> 48:58.240]  from the VAERS reports over 11,000 dead from the vaccine and you want to force
[48:58.240 --> 49:03.520]  it on me don't you you murderer you murdering psychopaths maybe if I play
[49:03.520 --> 49:08.080]  some nice calm quiet music while I talk about how you want to murder everybody
[49:08.080 --> 49:17.120]  then it'll be okay ah look I'm floating we'll all float in the end with Bill
[49:17.120 --> 49:24.480]  Gates no we won't no we won't we will go back to your phone lines though and we
[49:24.480 --> 49:28.600]  will take more calls from health care workers that have dialed in and we have
[49:28.600 --> 49:34.480]  Jay who is a nurse calling in from Alabama and Jay you are on the Alex
[49:34.480 --> 49:39.840]  Jones show go ahead hey thanks for taking my call thanks for calling I was just
[49:39.840 --> 49:43.680]  talking to your call screener I was going on a roll so I'm a registered nurse
[49:43.680 --> 49:48.240]  in the state of Alabama I've got I can I can go many ways with this direction
[49:48.240 --> 49:54.880]  with poison ivy ivy the terrible but I've been a nurse for several years 20 26
[49:54.880 --> 49:57.840]  years I've been in health care I also have a degree in occupational safety and
[49:57.840 --> 50:01.120]  health with a minor in industrial hygiene so I did ER nursing for about 14
[50:01.120 --> 50:06.720]  years Jay Jay Jay Jay do me a favor just slow down a little bit just slow down
[50:06.720 --> 50:12.120]  there we go there we go all right so I didn't know how much time you had trying
[50:12.120 --> 50:16.160]  to practice it's all good I'd rather be able to understand what you're saying
[50:16.160 --> 50:21.080]  than you know get as many words in as possible gotcha gotcha all right so my
[50:21.080 --> 50:26.320]  current job I do medical case management my I fix a lot of injured workers get
[50:26.320 --> 50:31.280]  them back to work that job entails me from going to go to every hospital from
[50:31.280 --> 50:34.080]  Birmingham Alabama all the way to Huntsville all the way back down the
[50:34.080 --> 50:38.200]  431 quarter so you pretty much see in the entire state you got a good idea what's
[50:38.200 --> 50:42.120]  going on the entire state and it frustrates me to know in that poison ivy
[50:42.120 --> 50:46.360]  just on on the air and terrifies thousands of Alabamians with no proof
[50:46.360 --> 50:52.560]  whatsoever um so where do I start I started a week into the pandemic last
[50:52.560 --> 50:57.320]  March our company kind of put us on a little stand by said you can't go out
[50:57.320 --> 51:02.640]  onto appointments about a week after that I started going back out I'm Alex's
[51:02.640 --> 51:07.400]  age but I'm probably more cut like you so I'm very healthy I'm into y'all
[51:07.400 --> 51:11.200]  supplements I could go in a whole you know different conversation about how
[51:11.200 --> 51:15.040]  wonderful those are but um anyway I started going back out I've never worn
[51:15.040 --> 51:18.080]  a mask I've always compromised with the doctor's offices or hospitals that I've
[51:18.080 --> 51:21.120]  had to go to and I put that stupid splash shield on looks like a welder's
[51:21.120 --> 51:26.040]  helmet you know air can get all around this thing but point is is um at all
[51:26.040 --> 51:29.600]  the facilities that I go to I've never seen piles of bodies anywhere I've
[51:29.600 --> 51:32.680]  never seen people begging to get in the emergency room I've never seen people
[51:32.680 --> 51:37.840]  lined up to get in the hospital being turned away major you know people
[51:37.840 --> 51:43.360]  falling out or major cases of you know rescue efforts on sidewalks or you know
[51:43.360 --> 51:47.440]  that the whole narrative that they try to paint to skip to terrify us in other
[51:47.440 --> 51:51.280]  words you've seen no evidence that hospitals are overwhelmed in Alabama
[51:51.280 --> 51:58.720]  zero from being up and down the state correct that's correct zero the
[51:58.720 --> 52:02.680]  University of Alabama Birmingham which everybody calls UAB here I took a
[52:02.680 --> 52:07.280]  picture they established a COVID overflow unit last July July 2020
[52:07.280 --> 52:11.600]  um if you come in from a certain way that you enter the hospital you kind of
[52:11.600 --> 52:14.680]  come in at an upper level and you can overlook the pavilion where they set
[52:14.680 --> 52:20.240]  this COVID overflow unit up it was July of last year a year last year I took a
[52:20.240 --> 52:25.200]  picture of this thing over that that overlook and the COVID overflow unit yet
[52:25.200 --> 52:30.040]  one o'clock in the afternoon on Thursday consisted of two nurses and an ER tech
[52:30.040 --> 52:33.160]  with their feet propped up on the table playing on their phones okay so this is
[52:33.160 --> 52:37.880]  the story that that's happening everywhere around here they have you know
[52:37.880 --> 52:42.000]  it's a very left-leaning institution without saying too much I've got a
[52:42.000 --> 52:48.160]  pretty trusted confidant in the COVID research department at UAB and I could
[52:48.160 --> 52:52.720]  go on for hours about all the the discrepancies that are going on but in a
[52:52.720 --> 52:57.680]  nutshell they've got several doctors in this department one of them I overheard
[52:57.680 --> 53:01.160]  a conversation they're telling people in order to get them to participate in the
[53:01.160 --> 53:06.480]  vaccine trials that one in a hundred people are dying hold on hold on hold on
[53:06.480 --> 53:11.960]  I want to make sure that I heard that correctly just just restate restate
[53:11.960 --> 53:16.640]  what you just said yeah there's a physician in their COVID research
[53:16.640 --> 53:20.920]  department that are telling would be participants that one in a hundred
[53:20.920 --> 53:24.200]  people are dying from COVID I mean wrap your head around that think think about
[53:24.200 --> 53:28.200]  one in a hundred people walk out into any city sidewalk and and you would see
[53:28.200 --> 53:32.520]  people lying everywhere with that statistic there's another doctor by the
[53:32.520 --> 53:37.480]  name of my way just to just to amplify what you're saying if that were the case
[53:37.480 --> 53:43.520]  you would have seen a 1% increase in the death rate in the United States in the
[53:43.520 --> 53:46.920]  year 2020 we did not see a single percentage increase in the death rate
[53:46.920 --> 53:51.440]  not even a fraction of a percentage except we saw drug overdoses go up and
[53:51.440 --> 53:57.520]  suicides go up which I think resulted in a point zero zero three or a point zero
[53:57.520 --> 54:05.840]  three percent uptick in the death rate from 2019 to 2020 so if it was one
[54:05.840 --> 54:08.800]  percent of people to get COVID are dying and all this numbers we would have
[54:08.800 --> 54:11.480]  seen at least a one percent increase in the death rate in the United States we
[54:11.480 --> 54:19.000]  did not absolutely absolutely and and and the things that they're telling would
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.480]  be participants over there the the research is that the UAB is doing on
[54:23.480 --> 54:28.920]  COVID are what the pharmaceutical companies pay them to research they are
[54:28.920 --> 54:32.720]  not doing any useful studies and of course that just gets whatever they
[54:32.720 --> 54:36.080]  desire they just get the result they pay for the result they desire exactly
[54:36.080 --> 54:40.480]  exactly that's what it is so why if UAB's they're a magnet status hospital
[54:40.480 --> 54:43.800]  they're level on trauma center so they do a lot of different studies between the
[54:43.800 --> 54:49.080]  university and the hospital side you know simple things there's a walking
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.520]  concourse all over the campus you know why aren't they studying why people are
[54:52.520 --> 54:55.280]  walking down this concourse touching the handrails touching the doorknobs touching
[54:55.280 --> 55:01.200]  the elevator buttons and not spreading it we had a friend of a friend who is at
[55:01.200 --> 55:07.800]  church he was in his mid-60s he had a condition called pulmonary fibrosis which
[55:07.800 --> 55:12.800]  is a degenerative condition of the lungs usually happens from you know former
[55:12.800 --> 55:17.600]  smokers people being in mines that kind of stuff he went in the hospital a week
[55:17.600 --> 55:24.280]  before last they tested him of course he tested positive for COVID I suspect it
[55:24.280 --> 55:29.560]  was probably something from a flu shot that he'd received last year they had a
[55:29.560 --> 55:32.800]  policy at UAB once you test positive for COVID you're paying your family
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.000]  members inpatient you cannot go into the facility for 21 days so and then it
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.240]  becomes the tyranny of the quarantine and everything when most of these most
[55:42.240 --> 55:45.640]  of these PCR tests were false positive in fact again I've got a story in the
[55:45.640 --> 55:49.960]  news I'll have to cover it tomorrow I think it was out of Europe they basically
[55:49.960 --> 55:54.680]  did a huge study on the PCR test and showed that most pop most COVID positive
[55:54.680 --> 55:58.120]  for false positives correct and that's what they that's what they use they use
[55:58.120 --> 56:03.720]  the PCR and they told the family this so look I got a bump I got a bump you
[56:03.720 --> 56:06.280]  have been on air a lot there's been a great caller I just got to take other
[56:06.280 --> 56:11.520]  callers but you know let me just say this because I'm not a doctor I don't
[56:11.520 --> 56:15.640]  claim to be an expert in medicine but you know there's that we're allowed to have
[56:15.640 --> 56:23.200]  common sense folks okay for a virus to travel from me to somebody else is
[56:23.200 --> 56:31.040]  essentially like man traveling to Mars that's the length of distance when you
[56:31.040 --> 56:35.480]  talk about size and scale for a virus to be transmitted that virus basically is
[56:35.480 --> 56:40.280]  traveling the distance from earth to Mars to be to be transmitted so I mean
[56:40.280 --> 56:43.280]  yeah if I'm hanging around people and I'm sneezing on people and they're
[56:43.280 --> 56:47.720]  directly breathing in my sneeze or I'm rubbing my nose and face and all of this
[56:47.720 --> 56:50.840]  and then rubbing it on their hands and then maybe they lick their fingers or
[56:50.840 --> 56:54.560]  something then yeah maybe you could spread it but I mean who knows how long
[56:54.560 --> 56:59.200]  does it take your body to start making the antibodies from COVID or whatever
[56:59.200 --> 57:03.160]  else you get that hey maybe now I'm not even necessarily spreading the disease
[57:03.160 --> 57:06.600]  but I'm spreading antibodies if you even believe that nobody who wants to think
[57:06.600 --> 57:10.160]  about this common sense nobody even wants to try to run tests to try to figure
[57:10.160 --> 57:14.360]  out about this stuff they just want to use every every different angle every
[57:14.360 --> 57:18.920]  different way to fear monger over it I mean they they were literally putting
[57:18.920 --> 57:23.440]  out graphics saying that COVID can basically fly like a ninja virus with a
[57:23.440 --> 57:26.880]  brain they just came out guys let's see if we can do this in the 20 seconds till
[57:26.880 --> 57:31.360]  break they just came out with a study that said COVID is your if you fart
[57:31.360 --> 57:35.720]  you're spreading COVID I'm not even kidding you I'm not even kidding you
[57:35.720 --> 57:39.440]  they're saying COVID is deadly being spread through farting now so what are
[57:39.440 --> 57:43.080]  we all gonna have to walk around in diapers too so we'll have to like walk
[57:43.080 --> 57:47.360]  walk around in diapers like by yeah there it is can farts transmit COVID
[57:47.360 --> 57:54.840]  it's what a joke the biosecurity state is here it's an anti-human eugenics
[57:54.840 --> 58:00.280]  operation training us that humans are dirty bad and evil the corrupt puppet
[58:00.280 --> 58:04.560]  prime minister of Canada who says he admires the communist dictatorship of
[58:04.560 --> 58:10.200]  GDP and wishes to make Canada sane has announced that they're buying vaccines
[58:10.200 --> 58:15.560]  for every person in the country all the way out to 2024 and that in 2024 you
[58:15.560 --> 58:20.120]  will again take two shots and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks out that
[58:20.120 --> 58:24.440]  wants to put in your body this is the Rockefeller Foundation they developed
[58:24.440 --> 58:27.520]  this whole plan with Bill Gates they're now implementing it and now they've
[58:27.520 --> 58:31.560]  announced that US policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation of course
[58:31.560 --> 58:35.760]  the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf Alois
[58:35.760 --> 58:39.120]  Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Cosworth
[58:39.120 --> 58:42.960]  Hill Home Institute in Germany and fours will continue to set fast they fight
[58:42.960 --> 58:46.200]  this I don't know how long we can the enemies coming for us all now and God
[58:46.200 --> 58:51.080]  bless and good luck I would again get right with God right now but I'll tell

[1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:37.960]  then all right back out to the phone lines we go Jed called in from Texas Jed
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:43.840]  you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead hey Alan thanks for having me on I'm
[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:48.160]  actually calling on behalf of a dear family friend of mine who was a career
[1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:53.200]  healthcare facility administrator for some years so she has the trained eye that
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:59.040]  you would expect to pick out anomalies and how hospitals are operating so she
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:04.000]  reports just as of two days ago taking trying to get care for a dear family
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:11.860]  member of hers at local area hospitals and what she found was the the waiting
[1:03:11.860 --> 1:03:14.960]  rooms were stacked and overflowing there were people outside waiting in their
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:20.440]  cars all of these were non-covid patients when she was finally able to get an
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:24.120]  opportunity to talk to a doctor that was on duty at that particular one of the
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:30.480]  bigger hospitals there she said she she she kind of she was a little bit coy
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:33.520]  with him she kind of pretended like she believed the whole you know mainstream
[1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:37.720]  narrative of the hospitals being swamped and she said we know I imagine you guys
[1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:41.400]  are swamped that's why my husband can't get the care that he needs you know and
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:46.440]  that the doctor basically said oh no no not at all actually we're averaging like
[1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:52.720]  10 positive COVID tests today and there's no hospital that particular
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:56.640]  hospital averaging 10 positive COVID tests today and none of those people are
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:01.680]  being hospitalized they're basically their COVID wing is empty and what it to
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:06.160]  her trained eyes the way that she you know characterizes me is that it looks
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:10.400]  very much like they're rationing care and they're actually turning non-covid
[1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:17.640]  patients away ostensibly to create the appearance that the hospital is
[1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:20.840]  overwhelmed when in fact they're not and actually this doctor also said
[1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:25.480]  something that's pretty pretty relevant salient is that the policies that the
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:29.760]  hospitals are following are dictated by the administrators and the doctors
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:33.200]  basically have no say whatsoever they just they're just following orders yep
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:37.760]  yeah and so you imagine how easy it must be to take over a whole hospital system
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:41.360]  if you just only have to control the administrator of each of those hospitals
[1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:46.760]  and now we know how really all this policy is coming down from the UN through
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:52.200]  the CDC through the hospitals so it's all the it's all the medical tyranny in
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:55.880]  the one-world government now being forced onto local hospitals through
[1:04:55.880 --> 1:05:01.440]  Shaden Freud as we predicted the globalist are now launching a new
[1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:05.240]  lockdown the first one has already destroyed the third world already
[1:05:05.240 --> 1:05:09.080]  caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death and it's caused massive
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:13.400]  supply chain problems across the western world ladies and gentlemen now is the

[1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:20.880]  All right this is your final segment with me so I got to take as many of your
[1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:27.720]  calls as possible health care workers letting you know whether the hospitals
[1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:31.320]  are full or not because that's going to be the big mainstream false narrative so
[1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:35.360]  that they can justify this mandated vaccine as soon as they can get FDA
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:39.880]  approval. Let's go to Oscar in Pennsylvania you are on the Alex Jones show
[1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:45.600]  Oscar go ahead. Hey Owen how you doing? Good. All right long-time listener of
[1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:49.600]  sports you guys buy a lot of products but I just want you to know working a
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:53.320]  large hospital in Pennsylvania we're tearing down the COVID wings and all of
[1:06:53.320 --> 1:06:58.080]  our COVID wings for what's considered a negative pressure so that's be set up so
[1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:02.760]  it pulls the air in so the COVID doesn't get out of the room. We're going to
[1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:08.800]  work from zero to three cases bouncing around and the whole time how did the ICU
[1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:12.640]  where they were actually putting people on the intubators there was no
[1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:16.640]  transmission between the workers the nurses doctors no one actually got it
[1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:20.920]  from in the ICU I can't speak for the whole hospital but within that wing I
[1:07:20.920 --> 1:07:27.280]  can let you know it wasn't transmitted. All right Oscar anything else? Yeah it's
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:31.120]  just you know you were talking about that Dr. Brittany Cobia versus like a Dr.
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:34.240]  Charles Hoff she made that statement about how people are begging for the
[1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:38.120]  vaccine and you search her name and there's four pages of everyone carrying
[1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:41.760]  the same article but there's no mention of this Dr. Charles Hoff he's talking
[1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:45.720]  about the e-dimmer test you know and then everything else going on so I mean
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:48.040]  I'll just make a quick zoom into other callers but I just want to let you know
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:50.760]  they're tearing down the COVID wings you know they have to be set up a certain
[1:07:50.760 --> 1:07:55.200]  way and we're not being overran. Yeah I mean as soon as we stop playing around
[1:07:55.200 --> 1:07:59.160]  with this COVID goes away but that's the thing is that's why it never goes away
[1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:04.560]  COVID will never go away until they get that forced vaccine then they have the
[1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:09.760]  precedent to mandate vaccines and then that's total global government total
[1:08:09.760 --> 1:08:12.760]  medical tyranny they can take it anywhere they want from that point that's
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:19.000]  when we really entered the the bad the bad zone that's when it really gets bad
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.480]  Oscar thank you so much for the call let's go to Wendy in Michigan you're on
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:28.640]  the Alex Jones show Wendy go ahead. Thanks for taking my call Owen. I'm a
[1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:34.120]  nurse in outside of Detroit and I'm not currently working because I can't work
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:37.520]  under the conditions that they've got work they've got nurses working under
[1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:44.640]  right now but I just wanted to say that the medical system has created a
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:50.440]  situation where they've created staffing shortages like the nurse from
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:56.400]  Alabama stated with all the testing that workers have to go through you know
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:09:01.120]  people inevitably have positive with these fake tests. No exactly that's a great
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:03.480]  point like they're doing the same thing at the Olympics where there's just
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:08.320]  nothing but propaganda now like yeah if you test everybody all day long you're
[1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:11.960]  gonna get false positives and then they send half the nurses home it's like oh
[1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:15.800]  they got COVID and then they create that they create the false positives and
[1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:22.360]  they create the false pandemic. Exactly and so my point was that there there
[1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:27.320]  may be the hospitals may be overwhelmed but it's not with patients it's because
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:31.640]  of staffing shortage because you've got nurses testing positive and having to
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:36.720]  quarantine or isolate and then you've got nurses like me who just are not
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:42.320]  gonna deal with this nonsense and we pull out so it's gonna continue to be
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:46.720]  like that until you know more people wake up and you know it's gotten to a
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:51.920]  point where you know the ratios inside the hospitals are crazy you know you
[1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:56.560]  know one nurse with you know however many patients maybe 10 patients at some
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:01.120]  you know in some cases and you know that's just not safe and I know one
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:05.440]  hospital system here they're paying bonuses of like a thousand dollars a
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:09.720]  shift just to get nurses to pick up extra shifts and they still can't get
[1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:15.840]  enough nurses to work. And it's all a self-fulfilling prophecy when you when
[1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:20.480]  you run when you test everybody 24-7 doesn't matter if they're symptomatic
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:24.320]  asymptomatic doesn't matter if it's a false positive or not just do the total
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:27.800]  panic routine and send them home and then you have the shortage of nurses and
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:31.160]  then you can say oh look the hospitals are in trouble total self-fulfilling
[1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:35.320]  prophecy Wendy thank you so much for the call let's go to Steven calling in
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:40.400]  from Boston Steven you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead. Hi Owen you work at
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:45.680]  Boston Medical Center so our our hospital actually sends out a newsletter
[1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:50.320]  that's hospital-wide and basically informs us of statistics every week how
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:55.120]  many COVID admissions there are and how many staff get sick and usually the
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:11:04.640]  numbers for the patients are in the single digits if that. Okay I'm sorry
[1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:08.680]  are you saying you're going to read the statistics. Actually I don't have them
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:12.240]  in front of me but week by week the statistics are always in the single
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:16.360]  digits now. Okay so you're saying you're saying that you have the statistics in
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:19.920]  the hospital and it's not that there's you're not overwhelmed with COVID. Not at
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:25.080]  all when COVID was in full swing they did limit how many beds were
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:28.800]  accessible and then you know whatever they had left they then claim that they
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:33.480]  had a shortage just to dramatize everything at the same time they were
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:37.000]  telling us for three months not to wear masks because you know there's a supply
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.200]  shortage and at the same time they fought tooth and nail not to not to pay
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:50.640]  any of their administrative staff hasn't paid. Anything else Steven. Other than my
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:53.840]  hospital trying to mandate the vaccination that's going to manufacture
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:12:01.280]  another type of staffing shortage. Oh no doubt I mean whether I mean look the
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:05.400]  right now I mean I think we have enough data to say that the odds of you dying
[1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:10.040]  from the vaccine are obviously very low probably less than 1% I mean that could
[1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:14.320]  change with time but just in the time and scope that we have now but still it's
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:18.120]  deadly and I mean that's attempted murder to me and I'm not trying to do
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:22.600]  fear mongering here folks but I mean that's just the fact. Well I had two
[1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:26.440]  people in my clinic both of them had strokes shortly after getting
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:33.240]  vaccination. They do have COVID nurses now stationed at every major clinic to
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:37.200]  issue vaccines to anybody that wants them but before that happened we would
[1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:42.400]  hear hospital wide intercom calls for emergency services for you know going
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:47.640]  directly to the COVID injection sites and now it kind of diffused those calls
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:51.400]  out so you know it's just going to go to those individual clinics no one's going
[1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:54.680]  to have to hear that it's actually going to directly to the COVID clinic to
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:13:00.600]  care people. And you know most people that it's 99.99% of people to get
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:04.000]  COVID recover most people they claim have COVID don't even have a single
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:08.360]  symptom. You're at a 50-50 shot you get a COVID vaccine you're gonna have a
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:13.360]  serious side effect. You're at about a 10% chance you're gonna have a life
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:18.080]  altering side effect and you've got about a one or less percent chance of
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:23.400]  something deadly or you'll never even be yourself again so that's what we
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:27.960]  have this far and we're not even a year into this experimental vaccine yet.
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:33.960]  Steven thank you for the call let's go to Jared in Arkansas you're on the Alex
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:42.680]  Jones show Jared go ahead. Hey thanks for taking my call I was pressured in to
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:48.640]  getting the vaccine and I haven't had any major side effects thankfully but I
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:52.240]  was just wondering is there any kind of supplements or vitamins or minerals that
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:57.600]  I can take to reduce the negative effect for the vaccine? The only you know any
[1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:03.320]  sort of heavy metal detoxification or NAC is a supplement that I've heard
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:08.560]  doctors say that they think helps work to fight back against it is NAC but you
[1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:12.920]  know what I don't want to I should probably maybe get doctors on to do a
[1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:17.960]  real just hardcore in-depth analysis of that question alone so that I can be
[1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:21.160]  better well versed to answer it but right now that's really the best answer
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:26.080]  I could give you I just do any sort of normal heavy metal detoxifier sweat the
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:29.640]  NAC is the only supplement I've heard recommended and they tried to ban it and
[1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:32.400]  take it off the shelves right before the vaccine came out so I mean if anything
[1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:39.400]  that may tell you that that's the one. I got you I appreciate it. All right Jared
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:44.240]  thank you all right folks I didn't know we were gonna have three segments of
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:49.960]  reports from Alex so I intended on taking more calls today but Alex is

[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:11.800]  plugging your sleep supplements. It's basically the only way I get sleep
[1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:16.080]  anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity. It's like
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:20.160]  we're living in a twilight zone. Alright Eric in New Hampshire. Eric thanks for
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:23.280]  calling go ahead. Hey Alex thanks for taking my call. If I could I just want to
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:27.120]  throw a quick plug out for one of the product. The XTube does wonders. They
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:30.440]  recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it. Get off the fence, get the
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:34.480]  product, support the InfoWars. Tyler in Maine you're on the year. Thanks for
[1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:38.200]  holding go ahead. Hey Alex it's great to be on with you. It's an honor. Honor talk to you.
[1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:43.680]  Awesome. So first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product. Alpha Power
[1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:49.240]  even at 29. If you ask my better half she loves it and it helps in the bedroom so
[1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:54.440]  just number one for a few of you. It definitely works. It's not a joke.
[1:18:54.440 --> 1:19:02.080]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're
[1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:06.400]  supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:09.960]  what we do. But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:14.000]  great ways to communicate I still have one because this Trojan horse this
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.280]  Promethean fire has a lot of power. But when I'm not using it I lock it up in a
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:23.440]  high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com. We finally got

[1:20:03.160 --> 1:20:05.920]  Jones show
[1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:35.880]  Ladies and gentlemen the information I'm about to reveal here is the
[1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:43.240]  biggest news story and has the greatest impact and import on humanity of any
[1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:50.440]  story in the 21st century in the last 21 years of this century. This information
[1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:55.440]  is as big as Adolf Hitler starting World War two. It is as big as Lenin and
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:59.520]  Stalin in the Soviet Union and the crimes they committed. This is as big as
[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:05.720]  Mao Zedong. That all happened the 20th century. This is the biggest news in the
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:10.480]  21st century. It's a hundred percent documented hiding in plain view and
[1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:14.840]  we're about to lay it out right now.
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:23.740]  Respected international organizations of doctors, physicians, scientists,
[1:21:23.740 --> 1:21:28.120]  epidemiologists, virologists, you name it have formed in the last year and a half
[1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:32.760]  all over the world and they've been reviewing studies going back decades and
[1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:37.360]  current studies where it was conclusively known in the literature at
[1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:41.480]  prestigious facilities like the University of Texas level 4 lab in
[1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:47.400]  Galveston, Texas by 2012 that if you try to create a vaccine for the protein
[1:21:47.400 --> 1:21:52.440]  shell of a coronavirus it makes the body attack the lungs, brain and heart and
[1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:58.520]  create billions of tiny micro blood clots that then start forming larger
[1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:03.560]  blood clots and what's incredible now is prestigious respected doctors and
[1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:08.560]  scientists and doctors that head up major ERs in Canada and others are seeing
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:11.960]  in their patients that have been injected with these experimental shots the
[1:22:11.960 --> 1:22:17.720]  exact same thing happening. Now I'm gonna get to this report and then I'm gonna
[1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:21.080]  go through some of the background I'll show you some of the studies but first
[1:22:21.080 --> 1:22:25.800]  do you know who funded the major three-year study at the University of
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:31.800]  Texas Galveston whose name is on the top of it? Anthony Fauci and when they came
[1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:36.360]  back to him testing three vaccines that would then attack that protein in the
[1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:41.600]  Coronasars family same as COVID-19 they said proceed with extreme caution do
[1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:46.280]  not make a human vaccine out of this it actually says that. Now it turns out there
[1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:50.880]  are hundreds of prominent studies in the British Medical Journal and the New
[1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:56.000]  England Medical Journal and others that all do this and all these other
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:00.160]  prestigious scientists like Dr. Yedon the former chief scientist at Pfizer and
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:04.720]  Wolfgang Wudarg and others went public before this started a year ago and put
[1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:08.600]  out emergency injunctions to the EU saying this is gonna happen blood clots
[1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:12.560]  and they still ignored it and then you saw the blood clots in the death but
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:18.720]  here's the big news I'm gonna play this first report. They keep saying it's rare
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:22.520]  it's rare it's rare when your mom your dad your neighbor your son your daughter
[1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:27.400]  or you get really sick or die from it but it's not. In the studies of rats and
[1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:30.600]  the studies of ferrets and other animals the vast majority develop blood
[1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:34.480]  clots and then died within a few months and humans they asked me to take a few
[1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:39.920]  years because we are a lot tougher but it gets worse. Dr. Charles Hoff very
[1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:43.280]  respected over a whole hospital facility and has a whole bunch of his own
[1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:48.320]  private patients has been having his patients go in that have been given the
[1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:53.300]  Moderna, Pfizer and other injections and they're finding exactly what is in the
[1:23:53.300 --> 1:23:57.360]  UT studies the British studies and others with the blood clots so many of
[1:23:57.360 --> 1:24:01.720]  them it's just incredible. So here's a nine-minute report of him on a doctor's
[1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:06.040]  round table report and remember this is being suppressed on Twitter and Facebook
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:10.600]  people with medical degrees with studies with science and then if you
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:16.360]  question it Fauci and the media say that we're murderers for simply questioning
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:19.640]  the fact that they're pushing an experimental shot on us so watch this
[1:24:19.640 --> 1:24:25.200]  report write this information down and while he's speaking we're gonna be
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:29.000]  putting on screen some of the mainline studies again from top of the line
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:32.880]  facilities that found exactly what he's seeing in his patients and they're
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:38.120]  finding this in other hospitals and clinics all over the world but they're
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:41.480]  trying to then gaslight everyone and say you can't question it and you must
[1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:45.240]  take it and you must have this vaccine passport which is the end game of a
[1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:50.040]  global ID and a social credit score that they're now gonna have carbon credits
[1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:54.080]  on to track your carbon use and have a global tax. Klaus Schwab has said that
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:58.960]  so he's in the fear of a virus to get that global ID but at the same time to
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:04.200]  also start depopulating so here is Dr. Hoff laying it out and then we've got
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:08.880]  more information that backs this up and explain why they're doing it. You spoke
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:16.320]  to a potential mechanism of action of the injury and you mentioned to me the
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:19.480]  use of a de dimer test which we all know what is for but we're gonna have to
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:22.760]  explain a little bit. Could you please speak to this a little bit and give the
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:25.480]  relevant context and introduction please but I think this is really
[1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:33.920]  groundbreaking and important. Yes yeah thank you so so one of the the key
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:39.400]  things that really bothered me when I started to see vaccine serious vaccine
[1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:44.920]  injuries in my own patients is that I had no idea what the mechanism of injury
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:51.280]  was and therefore as their doctor I had no idea how to treat it because you know
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:56.920]  as their family doctor I needed they would come to me for help and I needed
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:01.880]  to help them and I was clueless I mean this is this is an experiment and I was
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:06.600]  aware that there was literally what we call iatrogenic disease a medically
[1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:12.600]  induced disease being produced by this vaccine and so so I had asked this in my
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:17.080]  open letter to Dr. Bonnie Henry our provincial health officer what is the
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:22.120]  mechanism mechanism of injury and how do I treat this as these people's doctor
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:28.360]  and of course nobody knew and and the vaccine manufacturers had told us that
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:33.400]  the COVID spike protein does not go intravenous it stays in the arm the
[1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:39.160]  antibodies to the to the spike protein are produced in the arm and that's what
[1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:45.760]  we had been found but scientists now and Dr. Brody has actually very clearly
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:51.960]  revealed this that only 25% of the vaccine actually stays in the arm and the
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:27:01.240]  rest of it so these vaccines are a vast number of little messenger RNA strands
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:08.960]  the Moderna vaccine has 40 trillion messenger RNA molecules her vaccine
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:16.440]  does 40 trillion so so so these are wrapped in a little lipid capsule the
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:20.240]  lipid capsule is to enable them to be absorbed into the cells so this is
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:24.520]  injected into the person's arm in their deltoid muscle of the shoulder from
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:29.720]  there as I mentioned only 25% actually stays there the rest is taken up
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:33.880]  collected through the lymphatic system and fed into the general circulation and
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:38.960]  so it circulates around the entire body and I think every doctor knows that
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:44.160]  absorption from the the circulation occurs in capillary networks because
[1:27:44.160 --> 1:27:48.920]  that's where the blood slows right down that it's going through tiny tiny
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:56.720]  vessels so so these little nanocapsules containing these trillions of of messenger
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:02.320]  RNA molecules are absorbed into the lining around the capillaries what
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:07.720]  medically we call the vascular endothelium so so these little cap these
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:12.080]  little packages are absorbed into the cells around the vessels that the
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:19.640]  packages open the body recognizes these messenger RNA strands as as a gene and
[1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:25.240]  gets to work making COVID spike proteins so in a virus those COVID spike
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:30.520]  proteins form part of the viral capsule but the problem is they're not in a
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:35.880]  virus they're in they're in the cells around blood vessels so as a result they
[1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:44.440]  become part of the cell wall of that cell so normally the cells that surround
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:52.280]  your blood vessels have to be very very smooth to enable good and unimpeded
[1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:56.120]  flow of blood but as soon as you've got all these little spike proteins that
[1:28:56.120 --> 1:29:03.160]  become part of there's one central fact of criminal psychology the
[1:29:03.160 --> 1:29:08.720]  criminologists all agree on and that its criminals are extremely pathological
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:12.920]  even more the general public they do the same things over and over again and
[1:29:12.920 --> 1:29:18.600]  criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again well
[1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:25.000]  guess what it was Anthony Fauci and eugenicist globalist that ran the roll
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:29.080]  out of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that
[1:29:29.080 --> 1:29:32.800]  actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral
[1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:37.240]  research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:42.360]  and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:47.240]  then break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to
[1:29:47.240 --> 1:29:51.040]  roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19
[1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:54.480]  vaccine destroys your immune system basically giving you the equivalent of
[1:29:54.480 --> 1:30:00.320]  HIV that's right ladies and gentlemen as we predicted the globalist are now
[1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:04.640]  launching a new lockdown the first one has already destroyed the third world
[1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:08.040]  already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death and it's
[1:30:08.040 --> 1:30:12.200]  caused massive supply chain problems across the western world ladies and

[1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:18.440]  adding our own greens fiber caps to info wars store dot com but then I read
[1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:22.880]  the ingredients and I was blown away listen to this organic pea fiber

[1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:46.600]  caps at info wars store dot com so I'm excited to add this to my supplement
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:51.560]  routine every day I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an
[1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:59.160]  introductory price of 1995 that's 33% off at info wars store dot com
[1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:26.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:37.840]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's alex jones so normally the cells
[1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:44.200]  that surround your blood vessels have to be very very smooth to enable good and
[1:33:44.200 --> 1:33:49.720]  and unimpeded flow of blood but as soon as you've got all these little spike
[1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:55.040]  proteins that become part of the the cell wall it's now a rough surface it's
[1:33:55.040 --> 1:34:00.280]  going to be like a very coarse sandpaper it's it's now what the platelets are
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:04.480]  going to interpret interpret as a damaged vessel it's it's no longer smooth
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:09.920]  it's rough so clotting is inevitable because the platelets that come down
[1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:13.760]  that vessel are going to hit a rough spot and assume this must be a damaged
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:17.200]  vessel this vessel needs to be blocked to stop the bleeding that's how our
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:24.240]  clotting works so so so clots are according because of this and because of
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:32.440]  the nature of this clots are inevitable because of these these spike proteins in
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:38.880]  the capillary networks so I set out to them try and prove this it could this
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:43.840]  theory be correct and and so the problem is these little clots in the capillary
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:48.440]  networks are microscopic and they are scattered so they're not going to show
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:53.280]  on any scan they're just too small and too scattered it's not like the big
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:57.880]  clots that cause strokes or heart attacks they're too small and they're too
[1:34:57.880 --> 1:35:03.800]  scattered so how on earth can we know if the person clot and the only way is
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:09.360]  with a blood test called a D dimer so the D dimer is a blood test that is that
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:13.920]  will show up a recent clot it won't show up an old clot it shows up a new
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:18.240]  clot and it doesn't tell you where the clot is it just tells you that the
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:24.960]  clotting mechanism has been activated so I have now been recruiting patients from
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:28.400]  my practice people that have come into my office and others that have that have
[1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:34.540]  heard me speak about this and have asked people to do this D dimer within one
[1:35:34.540 --> 1:35:39.240]  week of their covert shot and so far and this study is ongoing these are
[1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:46.080]  preliminary results so far I've got 62% positive elevated D dimer which
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:51.520]  means that the blood clots are not rare that's what the so-called experts keep
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:56.160]  telling us the clots are rare the big ones are rare but the small ones are
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:02.160]  clearly happening in the majority of people 62% now I'll tell you what the
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:09.320]  real concern with this is is that a clotted vessel is permanently damaged
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:15.560]  that vessel never ever goes back to normal so if this theory is correct
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:19.600]  which it really looks like by these D dimer results and I'm told it has been
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:24.160]  done in Australia and it's been done in the UK and they also found elevated D
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:29.280]  dimers and they they they just sort of discarded the information because they
[1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:33.040]  said there's no clinical evidence of clots well the clinical the reading is
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:36.480]  because they're microscopic and they're scattered and so you're not gonna see
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:43.080]  clinical evidence but but in fact all of the frequent side effects of the of
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:48.600]  the shot which are headache nausea dizziness fatigue could all be signs of
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:54.640]  cerebrals from boses on a on a on a capillary level I mean those literally
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:59.920]  you could be having the thousands and thousands of tiny tiny little clots in
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:04.280]  your brain that won't show on a scan but they will give you those exact
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:10.600]  symptoms so so the concern is I have now got six people in my medical practice
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:15.360]  that that cannot exert themselves the way they used to be what what medically
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:21.480]  we call reduced effort tolerance six people who who now get out of breath
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:26.960]  doing things that they could previously do without any problem so I believe that
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:32.760]  these people locked up thousands and thousands of capillaries in their lungs
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:38.200]  in these six people so I believe these people now have permanently damaged
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:43.400]  lungs because they have got I mean that's why they get out of breath I have
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:48.080]  one fellow that used to walk two miles to my office every week for a shock for
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:51.720]  his arthritis and he says after a quarter of a mile he's done in other
[1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:56.880]  words his effort tolerance is reduced to one eighth of what it used to be and so
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:01.200]  I've sent some of these people for chest x-rays and CT scans to see what it
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:06.960]  shows and all it shows is distorted architecture that what the radiologist
[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:12.480]  record is it describes increased reticulation it's a very non-specific
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:18.120]  thing and it's because it's microscopic it's just but but the concern is because
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:23.280]  these vessels are now permanently damaged in a person's lungs when the
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:28.520]  heart tries to the heart tries to pump blood through all those damaged vessels
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:33.080]  there's increased resistance trying to pump the blood through those lungs so
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:36.160]  those people are going to develop something called pulmonary artery
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:40.720]  hypertension high blood pressure in their lungs and the concern with that is
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:46.200]  that those people will probably all develop right-sided heart failure within
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:51.240]  three years and die because they now have increased vascular resistance through
[1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:57.960]  their lungs and and lung tissue and heart tissue and brain and spinal tissue and
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:01.800]  all of that does not regenerate in other tissues it can regenerate liver and
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:06.840]  kidneys and muscle and other but there's some tissues that cannot and so this
[1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:11.800]  is this absolutely explains what I've seen in my patients and that's what I'm
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:16.960]  doing to prove it and my study is ongoing again ladies and gentlemen this is
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:21.640]  settled science like a shotgun blast the chest with a 12 gauge will probably
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:24.760]  kill you or being run over by a truck doing 80 miles an hour will probably
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:29.680]  kill you at least hurt you what these protein crystals are doing growing in
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:33.720]  the body is killing people in mass is causing brain fog is causing heart
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:37.840]  attacks is causing strokes is causing the lungs to bleed out like this and
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:41.360]  that's what all the medical literature said it would do that's what all these
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:45.320]  scientists doctors warned what happened before it even began and now they've put
[1:39:45.320 --> 1:39:49.880]  advisories on all these major vaccines that they can cause blood clots that they
[1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:55.040]  can cause strokes they can cause heart attacks and in much of the world these
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:58.520]  so-called vaccines these experimental shots are banned India's not taking them
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:02.640]  China's not taking them did you know that less than 10% of India is vaccinated
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:07.400]  right now they're refusing to take this now let's talk about the mode of Dr. Lee
[1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:10.360]  Merritt of American frontline doctors one of the best organizations out there
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:15.560]  fighting this tyranny came out in a long report that's on info wars.com and she
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:18.920]  laid out how this is unrestricted warfare by the big banks of the central
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:23.360]  cartels to destroy the real economy collapse the third world and knock out
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:26.520]  all their competition in the Western world taking out all the small
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:30.360]  businesses that again they call non-essential once those businesses
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:33.120]  have collapsed and after the infrastructure has gone for a few
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:38.000]  years then they can give us all universal basic income but with that will
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  come the strings attached that we've got to take the injections they take we've
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:46.080]  got to accept the carbon passports they said they're giving us and we have to
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:50.560]  go under this serious neo feudalistic control system so that's what this
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:54.760]  consortium is this is a short clip two minutes long the full report again is at
[1:40:54.760 --> 1:40:58.200]  info wars.com I suggest you get it and you share it this is Dr. Lee Merritt
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:02.760]  explaining this is 21st century fifth-generational unrestricted warfare
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:10.040]  that's a that's a worrisome sign and you know I don't want to when I when I say
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:14.040]  I think we're gonna have to at some point fight back these guys because I this
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:20.560]  isn't just a war that involves medical issues this is a multi-dimensional you
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:24.840]  know unrestricted war that we're in that involves cybersecurity and everything you
[1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:28.480]  know economic war cybersecurity I mean one of the things that's happening for
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:33.840]  example is food is being allowed to rot on docks the cost of shipping crates has
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:38.200]  been jacked up to $20,000 used to be two to three the last 15 years I have a
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:41.920]  friend in shipping says two to three years or 15 years it's been two to three
[1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:45.520]  thousand dollars and suddenly overnight it's $20,000 for one of those shipping
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:50.320]  crates so this is a food squeeze just like they did to the Kulaks in just like
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:55.280]  Bolsheviks did to the Kulaks to get rid of the freedom people in Russia to bring
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:58.680]  down and create the Soviet Union they couldn't get them any other way they
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:02.920]  starved them and finally disarmed them and killed them and and I gotta tell you
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:09.320]  it's looking more worrisome that this is an active they're weaponizing the
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:12.600]  medical corps and they've already met weaponized public health now they're
[1:42:12.600 --> 1:42:16.200]  wet now they're turning the military against their own people if this
[1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:20.440]  happens right well that's something we have to understand that we are not out
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:24.280]  of this I think we will win but we're not out of this shit the globalist on
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:28.400]  record want to depopulate the earth Jane Goodall just came out of the Davos
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:32.520]  group again and said we need to depopulate down to the population we had
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:36.800]  500 years ago which was 500 million the same number you see at the Georgia
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:41.160]  Guidestones put up in the country side of Georgia outside Atlanta by Ted Turner
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:46.560]  who's also part of this eugenics cult so mainline science says if you've had a
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:50.520]  vaccine that actually works with real attenuated science where you get a little
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:53.840]  bit of the virus of the bacteria that's either killed or damaged so it can't hurt
[1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:57.040]  you you learn how to defeat it
[1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:04.560]  Jacob in Ohio welcome go ahead hey how's it going Alex
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:08.480]  good but I'd like to call her I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep

[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:16.600]  lighting the moralization and absurdity it's like we're living in a twilight zone
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:20.600]  and all right Eric's in New Hampshire Eric thanks for calling go ahead Alex
[1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:23.720]  for taking my call if I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for the

[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:06.840]  about for 27 years has now gone for beta testing to operational the globalist are
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:11.160]  out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover their robot take
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:14.680]  over but the good news is we've been working and you've been working and
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:18.040]  others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:22.320]  to be able to find it off humanity is strong we're incredible and if we're
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:25.920]  aware of the attack that's happening we have a real chance of defeating it if we
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:30.120]  ask God for guidance we will defeat it so prayer is essential research is
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:33.720]  essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely
[1:45:33.720 --> 1:45:37.920]  essential and at the same time supporting info wars by buying high-quality
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:41.240]  products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:46.000]  and your family and they're also funding our operation info wars store dot com

[1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:01.120]  thank you for being part of the resistance the biosecurity state is
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:06.240]  here it's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are
[1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:11.720]  dirty bad and evil the corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada says he
[1:46:11.720 --> 1:46:15.680]  admires the communist dictatorship of ggping and wishes to make kind of the
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:20.320]  saying has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the
[1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:26.760]  country all the way out to 2024 and then 2024 you will again take two shots and
[1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:30.800]  he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks out that wants to put in your body this
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:34.240]  is the Rockefeller Foundation they developed this whole plan with Bill
[1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:38.120]  Gates for now implementing it and now they've announced that US policy is set
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:41.840]  by the private Rockefeller Foundation of course the Rockefeller Foundation by
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:46.560]  the 30s was the main funder of Adolf Alois Hitler and the eugenics at
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:50.320]  Goldsprings Harbor the train the Couserville Institute in Germany and
[1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:53.080]  bullwars will continue to set fast they fight this I don't know how long we can
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:57.440]  the enemies coming for us all now and God bless and good luck I would again get
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:00.160]  right with God right now
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:22.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show you are listening to an infowars.com
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:31.920]  frontline report if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:36.680]  globalist on record want to depopulate the earth Jane Goodall just came out of
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:41.320]  the Davos group again and said we need to depopulate down to the population we
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:45.720]  had 500 years ago which was 500 million the same number you see at the Georgia
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:50.080]  guide stones put up in the countryside of Georgia outside Atlanta by Ted Turner
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:55.480]  who's also part of this eugenics cult so mainline science says if you've had a
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:59.440]  vaccine that actually works with real attenuated science where you get a little
[1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:02.760]  bit of the virus of the bacteria that's either killed or damaged so it can't hurt
[1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:07.440]  you you learn how to defeat it that's not what this is FALTI is lying to
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:12.240]  everyone with ball face lies take the PCR test they now officially admit the
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:16.960]  PCR test is a hundred percent fraud and they're recommending it not be used to
[1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:21.560]  quote test for COVID well almost a hundred percent were fake positives that's
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:25.440]  why they would count spy that died in a car wreck as COVID to again jack those
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:29.560]  numbers up for fear but but that's all hold another subject how every piece of
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:33.560]  this has been a fraud Fauci and his cohorts are on every single channel
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:37.880]  remember Fauci owns the patents on these vaccines he ran the Wuhan lab he's part
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:41.560]  of the eugenics group that wants to have the great reset so he has all these
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:45.720]  conflicts of interest and here he is on every channel saying if you haven't been
[1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:48.720]  vaccinated you're the reason there's variants and you're the reason other
[1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:53.160]  people are getting set but we're putting on screen for you right now again some
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:57.000]  of the most respected and prestigious scientific institutions in the world
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:02.040]  saying the opposite including the discovery of HIV Nobel Prize winner that
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:05.840]  when you give people a so-called vaccine like this it makes them create deadly
[1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:10.800]  variants of the virus in truth it is mother nature taking the COVID virus and
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:15.360]  turning into less lethal variants like the Delta which they now admit has a
[1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:18.880]  much smaller sized spike protein on it people ask well how do you know this
[1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:22.680]  Jones I actually read the scientific literature hours a day to understand this
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:27.520]  I've interviewed hundreds of scientists and doctors and there's a real consensus
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:31.360]  on this but the real consensus of academics and scientists and
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:35.400]  virologists is all shut off and only people like Fauci get a chance to be on
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:39.800]  national news spilling their lies well the impact Jonathan is that you're gonna
[1:49:39.800 --> 1:49:45.320]  have the propagation of an outbreak that will continue to smolder so you
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:50.200]  are gonna have suffering on the part of the people who are unvaccinated there
[1:49:50.200 --> 1:49:55.600]  will be some not very many we hope but there will be some breakthrough infections
[1:49:55.600 --> 1:50:02.120]  even among the vaccinated so as long as you have circulating virus in the
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:07.760]  community which is predominantly because people are not getting vaccinated
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:13.160]  then they hurt themselves and you don't want to see that because among those are
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:17.200]  people that are gonna wind up getting hospitalized and some of them are going
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:22.520]  to die that's the individual impact on those who don't want to get vaccinated
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:29.000]  but there's a broader societal impact Jonathan in that if you allow the virus
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:34.440]  to freely circulate because so many people are unvaccinated you give it yet
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:39.240]  again another opportunity to mutate even more and you may wind up with
[1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:45.080]  creating a variant that in fact is alludes the protection of the vaccine
[1:50:45.080 --> 1:50:50.520]  we're very fortunate that even though this Delta variant is a real bad actor in
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:55.720]  the sense of being highly transmissible for the most part the vaccines work very
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:51:00.360]  well against it particularly in protecting you from severe disease
[1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:04.600]  leading to hospitalization but you let the virus circulate you may get a
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:09.960]  variant that's even worse and then when academics try to go online and talk
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:13.880]  about what's happened they are censored and they are silenced and that's what
[1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:18.560]  professor Martin Koldorf of Harvard Medical School had to say on
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:23.400]  international TV just a few days ago yes and I think it already has generated
[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:28.560]  damage because we haven't had an open debate about the pandemic and I don't
[1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:33.040]  really care if they sense the one of my tweets or so so personally I don't mind
[1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:39.160]  but when you have those censoring and also slander where journalists or
[1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:44.920]  scientists slander other scientists that means that there are many people in the
[1:51:44.920 --> 1:51:49.920]  scientific community who do not dare to speak up and among the infectious disease
[1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:53.400]  ethnologists that I know personally and that I discuss things personally with
[1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:59.120]  the majority have the same views with me that we need to focus protection or
[1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:02.960]  better protecting older high-risk people while letting for example schools to be
[1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:08.360]  open and that young people live near normal lives but that's not reflected in
[1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:13.320]  the journalism because there are many of my colleagues who do not want to speak
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:17.440]  up because they've seen what's happened to those who do speak up I don't think
[1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:24.160]  they should take my credential into account I think that people should be
[1:52:24.160 --> 1:52:30.640]  able to express their views freely in society whoever they are and there's
[1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:35.760]  actually a lot of the people who are not scientists who have very insightful
[1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:42.280]  thoughts about the pandemic and one of the principles of public health many of
[1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:44.800]  it always have been thrown out the window during this year but one of the
[1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:49.000]  principles of public health is that you will have to listen to the public they
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:52.800]  are the ones who are living through the consequences of the lockdowns for
[1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:57.800]  example where they have family members with mental health issues that they have
[1:52:57.800 --> 1:53:05.440]  to deal with where where they couldn't get to their doctorate to deal with the
[1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:10.880]  cardiovascular disease problems so it's very very important in public unlike
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:15.120]  other aspects of science like urology or immunology where you sort of are
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:19.800]  focused on the lab and the science in public health you always have to listen
[1:53:19.800 --> 1:53:24.200]  to the public and have a interaction with the public and you have to do it with
[1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:28.280]  everybody in the public so you have to be open to speak to everybody so here's
[1:53:28.280 --> 1:53:32.440]  how it works the globalists cook up the virus that they own and control they
[1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:37.800]  release it to create fear they then say you must take the vaccine to reopen
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:41.640]  society then they partially reopen society but they were always planning to
[1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:45.320]  bring the lockdowns back and now the head of the federal reserve Janet Yellen
[1:53:45.320 --> 1:53:50.240]  says only in Republican areas with our strike teams and then and the weaponized
[1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:54.480]  national institutes of health will we have new lockdowns in the fall so now
[1:53:54.480 --> 1:53:58.560]  they're gonna try specific lockdowns in certain areas because your neighbors
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:02.720]  haven't complied and taken the forced inoculation which again is a total
[1:54:02.720 --> 1:54:08.360]  violation of the Nuremberg code of 1947 any coerced medical experimentation any
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:12.960]  coerced medical action is a violation of the Nuremberg code punishable by death
[1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:18.440]  this is the essence of medical tyranny in front of you there is a crystal ball
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:27.080]  what do you see I have to tell you I personally think that something has gone
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:32.560]  very wrong in the world the whole medical the bioscientific underpinnings
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:37.600]  have been broken we're off our moorings we're not having evidence-based medicine
[1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:42.680]  we're not seeing reasonable conclusions being made we're not even seeing
[1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:47.040]  regulatory decisions being followed I mean I gave you the example of you know
[1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:51.760]  there are regulatory decisions that say COVID-19 testing is only for sick people
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:56.600]  that's not being followed because people are doing it for asymptomatic people you
[1:54:56.600 --> 1:55:01.920]  know the vaccines have been offered as an elective offering and they've been
[1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:05.280]  quickly mandated so we're seeing things off their underpinnings right now
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:09.960]  there's something going on in the minds of people there's almost a a worldwide
[1:55:09.960 --> 1:55:15.520]  contagion of a neurosis a neurosis is some type of disordered thinking that
[1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:18.800]  spreading from person to person that's probably more contagious than the
[1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:23.040]  viruses right now and this disordered thinking is I think rooted in fear
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:30.480]  distrust were rooted in anxiety and it's spreading all over the world making
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:34.360]  individuals come up with the most ridiculous decisions like not treating
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:40.040]  the virus early forcing unsafe vaccines on one another having vaccines divide
[1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:44.520]  the workplace in schools dividing families having people wear masks when
[1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:48.360]  they're you know driving or jogging or swimming this type of stuff makes no
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:53.360]  sense my crystal ball is I think we're in for about a three to five year period
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:58.760]  of turmoil and I think it's mental turmoil in human beings the types of
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:04.000]  things I've seen in the minds of people right now is really alarming and it's
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:08.200]  most alarming among colleagues in medicine and medical institutions the
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:12.800]  right decisions are not being made right now and people are being harmed as
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:17.840]  this facade begins to collapse as the truth begins to really come out what
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:21.120]  are they doing they're doubling down their lives so now Fauci and all his
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:27.360]  minions are saying 99% of people dying of COVID were not vaccinated but whether
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:30.280]  you look at Australia or whether you look at Singapore whether you look at
[1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:34.160]  the United States the vast majority of people at the hospital who they say
[1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:37.960]  have COVID and who are dying ladies and gentlemen guess what we're quote
[1:56:37.960 --> 1:56:44.200]  vaccinated for COVID 141 people are in hospital with COVID at present and 43
[1:56:44.200 --> 1:56:48.960]  are in intensive care 18 of whom require ventilation so this is a very serious
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:58.600]  disease of those 141 60 are under the age of 55 and 28 under the age of 35 and
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:05.680]  of the 43 people in intensive care one is in their teens seven are in their
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:12.760]  20s 300 in their 30s 14 are in their 15s and 12 in their 60s and 6 are in
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:19.400]  their 70s so this is affecting people of all ages with very serious disease all
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:27.200]  that one a vaccinated one person has a just received one dose of vaccine all
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:33.720]  that one a vaccinated one person has a just received one dose of vaccine
[1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:38.720]  here's Morgan got both shots and then almost died and they said it was COVID
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:43.960]  and he said I credited the fact that I had barely lived because I take in the
[1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:46.720]  so-called vaccines
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:51.720]  it's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most
