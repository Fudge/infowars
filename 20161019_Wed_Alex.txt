[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920]   (beep)
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.200]   - Sound one, we're going with Chevy.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:19.840]   - From the Infowars.com News Center,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.560]   deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas,
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.680]   broadcasting worldwide,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.720]   you're listening to the voice of human resistance
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.640]   against the Technotronic Technocracy takeover.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.920]   You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.360]   - As Americans turn the corner
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.440]   towards the final presidential debate on Wednesday,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.000]   the election circus has devolved into personal attacks
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.600]   and character assassination,
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.460]   rather than any real focus
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.280]   on the issues plaguing the United States.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.500]   - The media outlets did not even attempt
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.320]   to confirm the most basic facts,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.840]   because even a simple investigation
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.120]   would have shown that these were nothing more
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.560]   than false smears.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.080]   - Facing an avalanche of new accusations
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.680]   from women who are coming forward
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.400]   to claim he kissed and fondled them.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.720]   Six women are going public today
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.560]   with stories that echo what Trump himself said
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.000]   in that notorious hot mic video.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.720]   - He called this woman Miss Piggy.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.200]   Her name is Alicia Machado.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.160]   Trump spoke out about those claims on Fox News.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.020]   - And she was the worst we ever had.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.520]   The worst, the absolute worst.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.960]   And you know, she gained a massive amount of weight
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.280]   and it was a real problem.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.440]   - Regardless of the fact
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.520]   that Obama's unconstitutional open border policy
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.760]   is quietly responsible for killing
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.680]   as many as 7,500 Americans every year,
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.280]   20 on average per day,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.440]   due to the hordes of illegal drivers flooding the roads
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.000]   while Obama creates a pilot program
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.920]   to have Americans pay for Syrian refugees
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.160]   to come to the United States and move into our homes.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.280]   Regardless of the fact that food stamp participation
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.520]   has increased by 78% over the past 10 years,
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.040]   regardless of the fact that Obama and Hillary's
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.640]   new Cold War rhetoric
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.400]   amplified by a suicidal mainstream media
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.000]   has obliterated any shred of integrity
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.680]   6% of Americans still think cable fed propaganda media has.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.200]   After polls revealed America is almost completely done
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.560]   with the mainstream media.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.280]   Mainstream media stranglehold of propaganda,
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.080]   desperation and damage was palpable on the campaign trail
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.880]   as if its demise was what truly concerns Americans,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.360]   but obviously has panicked the ruling elite.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.880]   - He doesn't have the temperament,
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.960]   he doesn't have the knowledge,
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.800]   he doesn't seem to have the interest
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.440]   in acquiring the knowledge
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.880]   or the basic honesty that a president needs to have.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.920]   And that was true before we heard him
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.120]   talking about how he treats women.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.480]   - This is not something that we can ignore.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.560]   It's not something we can just sweep under the rug
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.000]   as just another disturbing footnote
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.680]   in a sad election season.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.960]   - By the way, Glenn Beck's supporting
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.800]   your statements here by the way.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.880]   - Because this was not just a lewd conversation,
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.520]   this wasn't just locker room banter.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.800]   - This was turning ISIS-
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.240]   - This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.080]   - She's so sad.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.960]   - About sexually predatory behavior.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.800]   - She cares so much.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.400]   - And actually bragging about kissing and groping women
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.080]   and using language so obscene
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.120]   that many of us were worried about our children hearing it
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.240]   when we turn on the TV.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.080]   - Oh, she cares so much about the kids.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.520]   - You know, she made a powerful speech.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.440]   They said it was the greatest speech of the decade, I think.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.560]   - Speaking to everyone out there who respects women
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.800]   and saying, "Put your politics aside for a second
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.200]   and be able to call something that's indefensible
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.040]   and defensible and that's what it's for."
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.240]   - They care less about women who are getting killed
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.080]   and enslaved.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.680]   - Put your politics aside for a second.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.520]   - They say nothing about China.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.480]   - Online news is the future and Washington DC knows it.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.440]   Six in 10 Americans are getting their news
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.640]   from social media alone, while one in five households
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.640]   has dropped cable's buffet of news propaganda
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.200]   to research digital options and think for themselves.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.440]   Mainstream media, with its hubris as shallow and obvious
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.280]   as the corporate government criminals it represents,
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.440]   appears to be breathing its last gasp.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.320]   John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.560]   - Absolutely, and here is the bottom line.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.760]   Even if Trump doesn't get elected, which I think he will,
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.000]   they may try to steal it.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.200]   Resistance is victory.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.480]   We're exposing their whole criminal operation.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.520]   This is really a referendum on mainstream media
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.000]   and they've totally shown their hand
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.200]   and destroyed themselves and the ratings show that.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.040]   They're over.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.960]   - Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.920]   Sting video, paid Hillary operatives inciting violence
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.080]   at Trump rallies.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.880]   Article up by Kit Daniels.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.200]   A video released by Project Veritas reveals
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.560]   the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC are involved
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.540]   in this tactic called bird-dogging and rely on a network
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.760]   of Democratic consultants to oversee the operation
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.160]   and to give Hillary plausible deniability
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.400]   if the tactic is exposed.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.800]   In turn, the consultants are working with Democratic
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.540]   super PACs and other groups to give maximum media exposure
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.800]   to the bird-dogging violence, which they admit targets
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.400]   the elderly and disabled for maximum shock value.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.840]   In an email released by WikiLeaks, shows that at least
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.960]   one bird-dogging operation was approved directly
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.140]   by Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robbie Mook,
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.380]   on July 4th of 2015.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.420]   You can find more reports like this at Infowars.com.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:01.700]   - I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.260]   Will you and your family be financially protected
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.980]   if there's another economic meltdown?
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.900]   Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.740]   is coming.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.580]   I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.680]   Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.500]   your hard-earned money.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.100]   Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.020]   at 844-541-ALEX.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.420]   It's a company I trust.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.040]   They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.180]   that could help safeguard your money
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.460]   in an economic meltdown.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.700]   I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.620]   China recently bought more than a billion dollars
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.100]   worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.940]   Gold and silver are recognized worldwide
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.000]   as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.

[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.500]   financial protection a priority.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.180]   I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.820]   Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX now.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.100]   A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.580]   Instead of buying five, six,

[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.920]   Watching Fox, watching CNN, watching MSNBC now
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.780]   is almost like watching the same channels.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.120]   The way they spin and deceive is simply incredible.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.240]   I watched two different Fox shows this morning
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.400]   while I was working out,
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.880]   and they all agreed there's really no election fraud
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.000]   going on, and it's very rare,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.080]   and there's very little voter fraud,
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.240]   and Donald Trump really shouldn't be talking about this
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.000]   after President Obama came out and attacked him yesterday
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.360]   while speaking with the Italian president
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.300]   from the Rose Garden.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.520]   And I'm sitting there thinking, what planet are we on?
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.940]   Because we've got Scott Fovill,
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.140]   the national coordinator under Robert Cramer,
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:41.400]   who goes to the White House 200 plus times
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.540]   in the last few years,
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.880]   and is running the national program
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.860]   funded by Soros and MoveOn and others
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.760]   to go around and have people illegally vote.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.360]   I mean, they're on video saying,
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.740]   and having them bust around the polling station
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.220]   after polling station in battleground states
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.440]   from Pennsylvania to Ohio to Florida to New York,
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.880]   who they see as a battleground
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.240]   'cause they know how well Trump's really doing,
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.000]   cussing and bragging and acting like people
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.020]   right out of a "Cops and Robbers" movie.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:17.520]   And of course, this morning it was 200 plus times.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.480]   Now the actual number has been confirmed 340 times.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.600]   They have to dig through the records.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.160]   Breitbart's done that.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.000]   So.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.580]   (silence)
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.660]   So we've got the White House,
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:41.060]   we've got the White House knee deep in all of this,
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.740]   publicly.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.180]   And you've got the head
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.740]   of the New York Election Commission, a Democrat,
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.160]   saying the candidates bust their people around,
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.200]   the Democrats run and are stealing elections,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.720]   and he thinks it's wrong,
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.880]   but there's nothing he can do about.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.520]   Then we have Scott Fovle,
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.900]   the underling of Mr. Kramer, Robert Kramer,
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:10.520]   on video saying
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.260]   that they are stealing elections.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.800]   And the best part is he goes,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   there's nothing they can do about it.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.820]   We don't even care if reporters catch the fraud
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.900]   because the media is not gonna pick it up
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.180]   and there's nothing they can do
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.980]   and nobody's gonna prosecute us.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.860]   Folks, Democrats are so criminal in this country now
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.780]   that in California, Illinois,
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.300]   and six or seven other states in the last year,
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.140]   they tried and in some cases passed laws
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.500]   that were then not implemented
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.860]   because they were so illegal at the federal level
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.480]   to allow illegal aliens to vote.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.180]   It actually says you can land on a plane,
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.640]   and if it's on election day, you can vote.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.020]   You can come in on a visa or come in illegally.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.280]   You're not a citizen, you can vote.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.800]   Anybody could just Google that.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.240]   Democrats introduced legislation
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.120]   to allow undocumented to work will be the headline.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:13.120]   Or Illinois House passes unanimously
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.280]   a bill to allow migrants to vote.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.900]   I mean, this is crazy.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.220]   Because then they get up on TV
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.820]   and Obama says that, what's the exact quote?
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.880]   I have the clip here.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:35.740]   To Trump, stop whining about a rigged election.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.340]   Now remember, about three months ago,
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.180]   I come out and I say,
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.600]   they're going to try to steal the election.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.860]   They tried to steal it from Trump.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.820]   He stood up and said, no.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.140]   They did steal it from Bernie Sanders.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.460]   He has been certified by Stanford University and others.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.380]   You can just look on record that they had superdelegates
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.740]   in 11 states circumvent the actual popular vote.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.760]   So he won big time.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.120]   And so if they've already stole it,
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.620]   and if Hillary's already been caught engaged
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.540]   in so much crime, and as the former
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.180]   high-level Secret Service agent said two days ago on air,
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.980]   Hillary already stole the nomination,
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.740]   so she's already stolen the election.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.020]   She will go for broke.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.140]   So we live in a country
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.020]   where we have HD video of the head of New York elections
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.300]   saying it's total fraud, they're stealing elections,
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.400]   it's horrible, I wish we could stop it.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.340]   But the Democrats won't stop it, and he's a Democrat.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.140]   But he obviously is not a bad person.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:37.500]   And then you've got the number one organization
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.380]   for organizing voting in the Democratic Party
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.020]   since Acorn got sunk by James O'Keefe,
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.420]   the mighty James O'Keefe.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.080]   And no one is covering.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.800]   That's why I was really watching Fox News this morning,
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.740]   because there was almost no mention of it,
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.160]   and then they had Juan Williams on with Hemmer.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.300]   And Juan Williams was on there, and he was like,
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.140]   oh, it's no big deal.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.380]   That James O'Keefe thing's nothing, that's nothing.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.500]   So I tuned over to CNN,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.820]   and we've actually got a similar clip,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.220]   I guess that's the talking point,
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.780]   but it's a different show than what I saw.
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.220]   They're like, James O'Keefe,
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.040]   we're not talking about that to the guest,
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.460]   that man's a criminal.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.580]   The other host goes, yeah, a criminal.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.860]   He's a convicted criminal.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.400]   They didn't tell you it was for basically trespassing
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.060]   in a congresswoman's office.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.740]   Oh my God, he walked into the office
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.380]   and said, hi, I'm here to fix the telephones,
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.180]   'cause they turned the telephones off for days.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.260]   Remember that?
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.420]   Because they didn't want to take false,
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.420]   so he walked in to show they're a bunch of liars.
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.700]   That's what a journalist does.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.300]   They turn that around that he was trespassing.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.500]   Oh my gosh.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.780]   - Alex, you know, trespassing, again,
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.580]   you're being pretty modest there,
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.020]   but it was actually a less degree of a crime than that.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.660]   It was entering a government building on false pretenses.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.860]   - Sure, I was going from memory,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.820]   but that's how the media spun it, so exactly.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.900]   He went in a public building as an investigative journalist.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.780]   I think there was a law,
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.580]   entering a building on false pretenses.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.140]   I think they mean then that triggers a trespassing charge.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.180]   - Oh, they had to really try and find something
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.020]   to hit him with, because what he was doing
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.820]   was actually legal by pretty much
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.660]   every stretch of the imagination.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.660]   - The guy is an absolute American hero.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.340]   - To get into the phone system.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.460]   - He is an absolute American hero.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.660]   He is the model of journalism.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.220]   What he does should be taught
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.740]   in every journalism school in the world.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.780]   Instead, a bunch of false journalists, political frauds,
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.460]   get up on Fox and CNN and everywhere
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.980]   and call him a criminal,
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.340]   and then don't even tell their viewers
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.540]   what he's supposedly a criminal for.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.380]   This is like saying he has a fricking speeding ticket.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.420]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.900]   - Basically, he entered the building on false pretenses.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.300]   And like you said, it was Mary Landrieu's office.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.580]   And she was hiding from many of her constituents,
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.140]   saying she was claiming that her phone system didn't work.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:23.020]   And so his whole gist there was he entered with a hard hat
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.540]   and kind of like a construction vest.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.340]   And his intent was to go in and basically say,
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.100]   hey, I'm here to fix the broken phones,
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.380]   trying to catch someone, one of her staffers,
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.540]   saying there is no problem with the phones.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.500]   And at that point, he would have busted her out.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.420]   But what happened was one of his partners
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.700]   in the video sting went into it,
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.500]   and he was a little green
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.300]   and didn't use the right language.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.820]   It seemed suspicious.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.420]   And then he was actually able to make an escape,
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.580]   but then was--
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.980]   - Sure, I mean, I covered it a few years ago.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.420]   It was like three or four years ago back when it happened.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.380]   And by the way, I love it, Matt,
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.380]   when you pop it on the show, but we are TV.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.420]   You guys are gonna pop in, you gotta aim a camera at you,
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.940]   so we're not just looking at me while you're talking.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.700]   But you're making some really, really great points there
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.780]   to remind people, and that's why I raised it.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.860]   It's the way they deceive their viewers.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.660]   Oh, don't listen to James O'Keefe.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.020]   He's a criminal.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.140]   He's a convicted criminal.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.140]   No, he's an investigative journalist
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.820]   that snuck in there to show a lie.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.740]   You know, I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.620]   I've snuck into other facilities to expose things.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.660]   You're supposed to get a medal for that
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.260]   when you expose corruption, not get charged.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.500]   And they tried to charge you with felonies,
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.300]   wiretapping and stuff, but that fell through.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.540]   But that's an absolutely great point, Matt.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.660]   In fact, we're gonna get to some of these clips
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.500]   here in a moment.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.620]   Feel free to pop back in with those whenever you'd like.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.780]   But any other points?
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.340]   - No, no, you got it.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.020]   - What I'm getting at is it's so frustrating
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.500]   to see this level of deception and to see somebody
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.220]   who has produced more game-changing,
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.140]   on-the-ground investigative reports
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.940]   than anybody in history I know of.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.380]   The famous gumshoes, the famous Mickey Spillanes,
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.860]   you know, the famous folks that brought down
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.220]   corrupt mayors and corrupt mafia organizations
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.020]   are nothing compared to this guy.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:15.020]   His laundry list of devastation against tyrants is beautiful.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.500]   I mean, we probably wouldn't even be in the game right now
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.380]   if it wasn't for people like James O'Keefe and Matt Drudge
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.780]   and quite frankly, myself.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.900]   And I don't say that so I get credit either,
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.780]   but this operation, our crew, the audience,
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.220]   that is in full wars.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.660]   But when you talk about a one-man wrecking crew
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.300]   with his organization he has now,
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.740]   but if it wasn't for his push,
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.260]   we would be in even worse trouble.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.460]   And he just brings out bombshell after bombshell
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.620]   and to see the mainstream media unified,
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.340]   despite the fact that his reports now
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.780]   have tens of millions of views the last two days.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.420]   And there's no coverage unless somebody mentions it
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.700]   as a guest and they shut them down, they go,
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.780]   well, there's no evidence of election fraud.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.380]   Trump's crazy and we don't talk about O'Keefe.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.300]   He's a criminal who selectively edits.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.580]   No, he doesn't, that's why he puts out,
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.380]   they manipulate him into putting out 16 minute,
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.900]   20 minute, 30 minute, an hour long videos unedited,
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.660]   which aren't as powerful.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.060]   He needs to put out really short ones
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.140]   that show what the bad stuff is and then say,
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.060]   here's the full thing if you wanna see it.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.980]   But they kind of manipulate him, I'm gonna skip this break
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.500]   'cause I've talked to him on and off air,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.780]   into then putting the whole thing out
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.780]   like Planned Parenthood did.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.940]   The folks who exposed that,
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.940]   oh, you're saying we selectively edit?
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.020]   Here, here's three hours, totally unedited.
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.180]   You gotta edit it when you're undercover
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.180]   and you got five, six, seven hours of stuff.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.340]   If the jury wants to see the full video,
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.220]   they can go at night and sit in the jury box
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.260]   and watch the full 10 hours.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.100]   You don't have time in a trial, this is a public trial,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.620]   we're gonna show you the clips,
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.700]   the jury decides that they look edited, okay?
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.780]   And it's not edited, it's for brevity,
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.300]   the clips of the meat and potatoes.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.900]   Speaking of the devil, we're gonna play some of those.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.540]   I don't have time to fill the entire four hour show
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.740]   with this, but we're gonna play some pretty juicy clips,
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.380]   boil downs of what's happening.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.580]   But look, we've got governors and legislators
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.220]   and investigators coming out saying fraud
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.300]   all over the country.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.340]   We have got massive ballot box stuffing
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.820]   and early voting in Florida and New York,
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.140]   that's coming out.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.060]   We have got just incredible stuff happening.
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.300]   And again, we have Obama saying
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.460]   they're federalizing the elections to stop the Russians.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.420]   That's the crazy conspiracy theory
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.140]   we know about the Democratic Party
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.220]   and their election fraud using voter fraud
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:39.220]   at the grassroots, they are famous for it, world famous.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.420]   So again, this is just like saying, it's ridiculous,
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.020]   Obamacare is free and you can keep your doctor
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.100]   and there's no penalty, it's a lie.
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.900]   It's a right wing conspiracy theory.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.060]   I can't do a good Obama accent,
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.300]   but I'm quoting Obama right now.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.780]   Listen, it's a right wing conspiracy theory, all right?
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.500]   They don't want you to get a better deal.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.420]   This is it, don't believe them.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.100]   You like your doctor, you can keep it.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.780]   It's gonna be free for most of you,
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.500]   gonna reduce it for others down to the price
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.180]   of a phone bill or cable bill, all right?
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.620]   Don't listen to these people.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.540]   There's no penalties.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.380]   Joe Biden, Barack Obama ain't coming after your guts.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.980]   Not your rifle, your shotgun, your handgun,
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.980]   your semi-auto, none of it.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.620]   Let me tell you, he comes after my Beretta,
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.580]   it's semi-auto, he's gonna have a problem.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.660]   That's a quote, Joe Biden.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.740]   Did they come after your guns?
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.900]   You damn well better know they did.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:29.940]   And the new Wikileaks show,
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.460]   they're coming with executive orders.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.660]   So what we're facing is a wall of lies.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.980]   And I know you know this,
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.260]   but we've gotta get the word out to people
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.580]   that are still in the bubble that only watch mainstream TV
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.460]   and explain to them, you're a buffoon.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.660]   You got conned by Obamacare.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.420]   You got conned by NAFTA and Gatner
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.220]   and all this other stuff that he's against.
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.980]   He wants term limits.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.540]   He wants bans on lobbying.
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.180]   I mean, they are freaking out.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.940]   No wonder the political power structure's scared
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.860]   because their whole system is in trouble
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.860]   as he prepares to try to drain the swamp.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.660]   Here's another one, election expert.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.260]   This is Fox News.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.980]   We now have 4 million ineligible and dead voters
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.300]   on American voter rolls.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.700]   That's admitted, it's 4 million.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.940]   It's more than 4 million.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.740]   And they are voting, voting, voting.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.860]   They have people voting up to 10 times a day
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.100]   in early voting right now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:21.940]   around the country.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.860]   They've got 'em getting ready to vote
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.860]   more than 10 times a piece in battleground states.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.900]   This is unbelievable.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.100]   And you know why they're so scared?
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.740]   And they have Obama out there saying,
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.220]   how dare you say that Trump's gonna have people
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.380]   outside the polls looking for people voting more than once?
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.220]   How dare you?
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.700]   That's voter intimidation.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.060]   Oh, but there's no election fraud.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.820]   But if we go try to watch, we're trying to intimidate people.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.180]   You know what's gonna happen to battleground states?
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.140]   Folks are gonna go vote.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.060]   They're gonna sit in their car.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.060]   They're gonna see buses pull up,
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.220]   or they're gonna see vans pull up.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.260]   They're gonna see cars pull up
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.140]   with a bunch of people getting out of 'em.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.420]   Black, white, you name it, Hispanic, but generally poor.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.380]   A lot of times drunk.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.100]   They admittedly give 'em alcohol, pay 'em, you name it.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.860]   And then you follow 'em to the next polling place.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.420]   You go with a hidden camera, you got 'em.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.260]   You got 'em.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.540]   Now be careful about election laws,
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.060]   'cause they'll commit crimes and do this
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.740]   right in front of you, and then try to charge you
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.060]   with disrupting an election or whatever.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.900]   But look, we're gonna bring these tyrants down.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.340]   And they're scared because they know
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.420]   that Trump's organizing it.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.980]   We're helping people organize it.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.140]   You're taking action.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.580]   Just, folks, you go to a popular polling place
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.100]   in a battleground state, you're going to see election fraud.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:35.140]   It's very hard to catch 'em in the absentee stuff.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.340]   That's where they really load it.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.140]   They front load it.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.820]   But the big cheating, 'cause this is a landslide for Trump.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.700]   10, 15 points ahead.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.220]   Newt Gingrich said that two days ago.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.140]   He's absolutely right.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.060]   It's what I've been telling you.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.740]   Internal polls, that's why he knows it's rigged.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.020]   Because Trump's doing real internal polling.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.460]   And he knows that he's five to 15 points,
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.220]   depending where he's at, ahead of Hillary.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.580]   And then he sees the news saying he's behind.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.420]   Or he's in a dead heat with her.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.900]   There's fraud going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:04.940]   And you know that.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.940]   So we have to get the word out on those subjects.
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.940]   Now, I should've got to the show today.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.780]   I mentioned it.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.620]   We posted on Infowars.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.900]   We wrote stories about it, actually, on Monday,
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.660]   when it first started breaking.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.980]   O'Keefe sent us the big data dump,
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.540]   like he did Drudge and everybody else at the same time.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.460]   We reported on it Monday.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.620]   We covered it Tuesday.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.500]   Our reporters covered it.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.980]   But I haven't gotten into this enough,
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.220]   because, quite frankly, I thought
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.780]   that this would actually break through
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.540]   and get on mainstream networks.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:32.700]   It hasn't.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.380]   And O'Keefe's written articles that are on Infowars.com,
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.340]   dealing with the fact that there is a total news blockade
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.260]   on this information.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.820]   So we need to go to Infowars.com and other sites
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.420]   and get these videos and get them out to everybody,
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.580]   because the October surprise,
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.300]   why is the media ignoring the James O'Keefe video
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.660]   that shows Hillary Clinton supporters inciting violence
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.940]   at Donald Trump rallies?
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.620]   Inquisitor says claiming.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.180]   It doesn't claim it.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.680]   We have the WikiLeaks.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.140]   We have the police telling us.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.700]   We have it on video that they go and start it in Bird Dog
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.060]   and hit people first.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:14.060]   And then we have the organizers from Chicago
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.980]   nationally admitting it.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.460]   And guess what?
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.620]   Matt Dubiel that manages one of the big stations
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.960]   we're on in Chicago.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.180]   I said this, we're on two stations in Chicago.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.420]   He's been carrying us about five years.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.700]   He's come here and visited with us.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.600]   I know his family.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.680]   He knows this guy.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.660]   And he was on during March, confirming as a journalist,
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.140]   as the news director, also the manager at the station,
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.300]   that he was there and shot video that went viral,
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.380]   millions of views that showed them starting the fights
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.860]   when the media was announcing
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.380]   that the Trump people supported it.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.340]   So we had the ground video,
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.340]   the Chicago police through our sources,
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.980]   our other sources and the Democratic Party
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.700]   through Roger Stone, the WikiLeaks emails again,
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.700]   and now James O'Keefe video of the national director
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:04.740]   for the number one organization
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.340]   for quote, getting out the vote of the Democrats
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.220]   caught saying, we're gonna steal the election
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.940]   like we always do and cussing a bunch.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.900]   And also saying, we're busing folks in
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.500]   and also saying we sent people out to bird dog
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.580]   and incite violence.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.620]   We have them in the entire chain of command
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.900]   from Soros right through Hillary and Obama
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.080]   right down to their field captains.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:34.300]   We have the entire open and shut case,
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.540]   a jury would deliberate an hour before convicting them
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.140]   of organized crime and racketeering.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.500]   And by the way, organized crime racketeering
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.980]   is when you organize with powerful institutions and groups
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.540]   to suppress people's voting, people's right to work,
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.820]   people's right to travel,
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:54.140]   that is what racketeering laws were put in place for,
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.060]   to stop organized crime,
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.240]   the bullying tactics of thugs and scum.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.300]   Now we have them trying to threaten the FBI
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.900]   but also offer them bribes to say that Hillary
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.180]   didn't have classified info and lie about it.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.300]   And now we have them saying, don't worry Hillary,
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.220]   you're not gonna get in trouble,
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.900]   the shadow government's in control of the media
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.980]   and handling it, it's all there.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.100]   But oh my gosh, there's all these women
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.980]   crying crocodile tears all over every channel going,
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.260]   he talked about grabbing a girl
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.760]   when she threw himself on her.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.860]   And I started thinking back to just when I'm hanging out
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.980]   with friends, I'm not really a potty mouth type guy,
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.820]   but just being around other men, most men,
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.580]   it's just like some stupid junior high thing they do
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.700]   where you start making jokes
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.420]   and saying really silly, stupid stuff,
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.780]   a lot of it's just silly.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.380]   Now I'm catching myself going, did I just say that
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.460]   while me and the guys are riding around in a field,
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.580]   you know, hunting deer?
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.100]   I mean, did I just hear myself say that?
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.580]   I'm like, wow, you really don't think about
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.660]   the kind of stuff you say.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.140]   The type of really stupid humor, weird humor,
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.700]   nasty humor, and that's why I never claimed
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.820]   to be some perfect saint,
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.100]   because even though I love God, try to be a good person,
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.040]   and by most standards, I'm a very upright person
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.420]   and don't cheat and don't steal and care about things
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.260]   and a hardworking, a good father,
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.180]   you know, you get around a bunch of boys,
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.180]   get around the guys, I mean, let's not lie.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.400]   You start saying some really uncool stuff.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.260]   And okay, Trump's got a problem,
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.100]   but compared to organized crime and funding radical Islam
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.680]   to literally enslave women by the millions
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.220]   and hundreds of thousands of dead Christians
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.980]   and little girls and sex slavery,
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.500]   and Hillary's in there directing it and pushing it,
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.900]   because she hates Christians and the abortion
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.000]   and the babies and the keeping them alive
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.820]   and all the horrors and the evil
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.660]   and the brainwashing our kids in schools
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.500]   and just everything they're doing,
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.060]   and then you watch these women with all this vitriol,
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.160]   how dare him talk about women, how he wants them.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.140]   Meanwhile, it's the same women when rape accusers
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.140]   and people settle cases with them, Clinton does,
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.180]   the very same show, the very same women go,
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.020]   these are nothing but tramps.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:18.100]   I mean, they are just so committed to deception.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:23.100]   So when we come back, the 12th Wikileak data dump,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.900]   the latest economic news and so much more,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.140]   but I'm gonna play some excerpts
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.940]   of the James O'Keefe bombshells
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.820]   that they don't want you to see.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.100]   By the way, the London Independent's reporting
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.420]   that we finally know what Hillary Clinton knew all along,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.340]   US allies, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.400]   Yeah, she's the one that gave them the weapons.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.020]   The emails go further than that.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.700]   She's the founder of ISIS
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.140]   with Obama, Donald Trump's right again.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.580]   - We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.580]   Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:03.740]   - Tonight, tune into Infowars.com/show
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.420]   for live coverage of the big, epic last debate
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.420]   between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.780]   We're starting our pre-debate show at 3 p.m. Central,
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.340]   right after the main transmission.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.380]   So if you're already watching the Alex Jones show,
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.580]   just continue watching.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.700]   At 7 p.m. Central, we'll go over what to watch for
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.860]   during the debate, and the debate starts at 8 p.m. Central.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.780]   Now this debate is not just about Donald Trump
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.460]   versus Hillary Clinton, but rather it's about
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.620]   how the shadow government is finally unclogging
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.780]   before our very eyes to destroy US sovereignty.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.100]   The latest WikiLeaks emails reveal the inner workings
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.060]   of the global elite who are forging an authoritarian society
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.020]   dominated by technocrats in government, technology and media
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.380]   whose claim to power rests solely on their arrogant belief
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.340]   they are superior to the rest of society.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.700]   These elites say in control use of military conflict,
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.980]   which begs the question, will they force the US
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.500]   into a nuclear war with Russia?
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.620]   Will 2017 mark the beginnings of global tyranny
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.860]   or the renaissance of liberty?
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.660]   Again, tune in to InfoWars.com/show tonight
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.100]   for live debate coverage starting at 3 p.m. Central
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.740]   with the debate at 8 p.m. Central.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.980]   This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.940]   - Hey everyone, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here,
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.020]   host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know,
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.940]   I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.020]   You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.980]   Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare,
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.700]   nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country,
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.980]   obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.180]   and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.900]   One out of three or four people is dealing
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.100]   with some kind of health challenge
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.020]   and everyone knows at least one person
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.740]   with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.300]   If you're dealing with a health challenge
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.560]   or if you're healthy and wanna maintain

[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.620]   - You know, in the coming election,
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.420]   no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.820]   nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.140]   is the vulnerability of the power grid,
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.940]   the potential for power grid chaos.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.020]   EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather,
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.140]   hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.100]   My friends, chaos is already here
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.380]   and it's gonna get a lot worse.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.380]   That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have

[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:19.520]   - If you are receiving this transmission,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.300]   you are the resistance.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:27.560]   Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.100]   - Now I hate to say, see I told you so every five minutes,
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.940]   but I just want new listeners to understand
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.700]   that we don't normally have the time to go back
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.900]   and actually grab the clip from the time
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.500]   that we make predictions and lay things out.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.300]   But back in March when they really turned up the heat
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   for attacking every Trump rally viciously,
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.840]   remember that March, April, May, June, July.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.660]   Matt, who's just incredible back there,
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.860]   was just remembered the interview and remembered the date
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.300]   where we let it all out in our sources.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.620]   We had the Chicago News Station director on
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.460]   and we told you exactly who's behind it.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.500]   George Soros, the organizations, the groups,
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.240]   by name, what they were doing, why they were doing it,
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.260]   to blame Bernie Sanders and Trump
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.980]   taking out both Hillary's enemies.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.720]   Now we have the WikiLeaks emails.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:25.140]   We have the Hillary Soros controlled group,
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.560]   the head of the group, and then the national director.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.980]   Both admitting the criminal operation.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.940]   But saying it doesn't matter, we control the media
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.400]   and we control the police.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.160]   Now you talk about organized crime.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.260]   We have them saying we're above the law.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.200]   That's in the new tape today.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.580]   And O'Keefe says he's got stuff coming out every day now
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.220]   until the end of the election, so much of it.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:52.740]   Some of the things he told me months ago about
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:57.180]   are just unbelievable, unbelievable.
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.460]   And that's really why I catch myself out of breath now
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.440]   and really upset by the end of the show,
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.820]   because I don't get to so much of this.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.260]   I don't know how Drudge does it.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.960]   I just got chills really bad.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.300]   And I keep saying that because it's just like
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.660]   my whole body is like in horror mode, like you're cops,
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.500]   and you pick up the floorboard in this cabin
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.260]   and there's 10 dead kids, you know?
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.500]   You're like, wanna do something?
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.940]   And imagine if you knew the person that killed the kids
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.480]   was about to be president.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.660]   You would be sick at your stomach.
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.500]   Well, that's how I am all the time.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.340]   I was working at 10 o'clock last night,
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.380]   and I'm not saying thank me for that.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.700]   I can't stop.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:35.900]   I mean, this is real, folks.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.940]   We're not just putting rhetoric out here.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:42.140]   I am so ashamed of my country and the mainstream media
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.260]   that they would unify, lie like this,
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.900]   and do things like this.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.940]   I know there's evil people at the top of the government,
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.420]   but man, the general public and the media,
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.460]   a large contingent of them, are just bad people.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.300]   They have no morals.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.820]   I wanna ask the Democrats something.
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.140]   Is there any line you won't cross?
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.940]   Is there anything you won't do?
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.340]   Is there anything Hillary could do
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.660]   that you would say is too far?
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.260]   Anything, 'cause here's the deal.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.540]   This is so biblical.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.420]   This is judgment.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.900]   God is showing us, and the Bible says this will happen
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.700]   before total judgment, before a nation goes into bondage.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.700]   And historically, this happens,
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.820]   whether you believe in God or not.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.740]   This is a historical cycle.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:24.740]   History does repeat.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.260]   It does rhyme, as they say.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.500]   And all this evil's coming out so much.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.100]   And what's crazy is I cannot believe
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.220]   how accurately we understand the enemy,
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.460]   'cause I'm reading these WikiLeaks,
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.940]   and it just confirms everything we said
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.060]   exactly like we said it.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.220]   And I'm quite frankly saying, how are we this good?
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.980]   And then I gotta pull back and go, you're not that good.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.020]   These people are formulaic.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.900]   They run criminal, formulaic operations.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.500]   You study them all day, and it's very, very simple.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.900]   What's scary is they've got the mainstream media
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.820]   and the government and the prosecutors
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.380]   almost completely behind them.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.980]   And so they know that, and then you see 'em on tape going,
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.580]   "Nothing can stop us now," and then you know what comes next.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.380]   It hits you like a ton of bricks.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.860]   Oh my God.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.140]   It started the paradigm in history, the downward spiral.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.060]   They always bring themselves down
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.460]   because they think they're totally invincible,
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.100]   and so they start doing crazier and crazier
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:37.540]   and crazier stuff until they destroy themselves
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.380]   and us with them.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.540]   In criminology, almost every serial killer does this,
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.940]   but other criminals as well.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.980]   'Cause a lot of criminals do it for the fun
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.580]   of being evil and hurting people.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.020]   They don't do it just 'cause they wanna
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.340]   feed their starving kids.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.780]   That's doing what you gotta do.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.900]   My kids are starving to death.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.780]   I can't get 'em food.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:57.940]   I'm breaking in a grocery store.
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.460]   I'll be quite frank with you.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.420]   If there's no other way to get the food,
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.340]   I'll go bang on doors and beg first,
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.660]   and chop firewood or whatever,
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.220]   but I'm just saying, my kids are just starving to death.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.620]   Yeah, I'll engage in some criminal activity,
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.660]   but barring that, not gonna happen.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.060]   I feel bad when I'm on somebody's property,
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.100]   pick up a rock I really like, and I'll ask 'em,
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.460]   sometimes I'll get 12,000 acre ranch,
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.300]   I'll say, "Can I have this rock?"
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.140]   The guy just laughed.
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.500]   He said, "Alex, you're something else.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.780]   "I've known you since high school,
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.500]   "and I could give you a million dollars
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.720]   "and come back in 10 years,
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.120]   "and it'd all be there, and you'd give it back."
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:45.540]   And he went on to say, "And by the way,
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.460]   "there are not a lot of people like that."
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.180]   And I'm not saying I'm some goody two-shoes,
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:55.140]   I just do not understand the fall and the rot of society.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.620]   I just do not understand it.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.740]   Because all these disconnected people
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.060]   that have never had to live in the real world,
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.060]   they just think cheating and lying and stealing
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.260]   is cute and funny.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.580]   That's what happens at these Gruber events
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.540]   when he's on C-SPAN with a bunch of other professors,
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.220]   and he goes, "And I'm here to teach the undergrads
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.540]   "how to lie and how to cheat and how to be successful."
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.980]   And they're all hanging on his every word.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.140]   And so what's happened is, a lot of people
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.940]   discovered the New World Order and corporatism
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.180]   and the world government,
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.100]   and they decided to join with it.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.820]   I'll never forget, I went to a big conference,
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.820]   a smart growth conference in 1998.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.140]   Michael Dell was there, interviewed him,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.100]   a bunch of other people.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.780]   They had all these big former Dallas Cowboys and people,
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.500]   famous ones I grew up watching that were part of it,
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.500]   and they had all the big banks,
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.580]   and they had like 5,000 people there,
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.740]   and it was a big UN sanctioned deal.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.300]   And I'd go up to them and I'd say,
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.300]   "You know, in these documents,
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.820]   "you admit you're taking people's private property
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.580]   "and then building on it later,
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.260]   "and this is really just like a form of land grab."
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.700]   I'll never forget, I didn't have the camera running,
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.120]   and this famous Dallas Cowboy goes,
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.020]   "Of course that's what it is, you dumb son of a bitch.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.660]   "Get the hell out of my way."
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.340]   Big white guy.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:10.140]   He was just, big realtor up in Dallas.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.780]   He just pushed past me.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.140]   He's just like, "I'm cool again."
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.020]   It's a fact, 'cause I was like,
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.140]   20-something year old investigative reporter.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.460]   I'm like, "This is really wrong.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.960]   "They're taking ranchers' farms outside town
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.140]   "and not even paying them for it,
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.700]   "and then they build on it."
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.060]   Well, of course we are, get out of my way.
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.620]   And Michael Dell would just sit there laughing at me.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.780]   When I'd talk to him, he was just like sort of laughing.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.300]   Like. (laughs)
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.460]   See, they all knew.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.180]   They're all, it was like, "Of course, kid."
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.100]   So it wasn't that I was ever even that smart.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:51.540]   I just didn't join with them like everybody else does.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.060]   Almost everybody else who's smart decides to be evil.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.140]   That's the big revelation
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.380]   that's been hitting me stronger and stronger.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.140]   'Cause I never thought I was that smart.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.860]   I have, I'm naive, actually.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.540]   And you know what?
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.260]   The public kind of likes getting screwed.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.300]   That's what the elites always tell me.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.460]   They go, "Alex, they don't want to not be screwed.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.420]   "They'll screw each other.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.540]   "They'll screw you.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.360]   "Might as well screw 'em.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.620]   "Take care of your family."
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.440]   You know what?
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.280]   I'm not doing that.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.060]   But that's the moment we've come to, is that
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:30.060]   I went and investigated family ranches and things
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.540]   that went back over 100 years,
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.140]   where they were ranching and everything.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.900]   And they were just taking their ranches
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.380]   all over outside Austin.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.180]   And today they got big mansions built on 'em.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.940]   And they took 'em and said it was gonna be for the earth
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:41.940]   and the Golden Geek Warbler.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.860]   It was all a lie.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.020]   And of course they knew that.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:49.300]   And it was a big organized crime feeding frenzy
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.500]   of everyone running around wanting to get rich.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.740]   There were no liberals at that meeting.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.940]   Their liberal outfits were their camouflage.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.240]   The minute, just like Hillary Clinton,
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.780]   the minute you'd actually talk to 'em
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:02.620]   and there wasn't a camera on,
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.260]   they'd go, "Of course that's what it is.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.340]   "Just laugh at me."
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.540]   And that's why Hillary has her public side
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.740]   and then she has her private side.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.540]   In public, she's like, "Oh, I love black people."
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.680]   In private, she's like, "Tell that stupid N-word
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.260]   "to get me a piece of cheesecake right now.
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.400]   "Tell that dumb N-word."
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.060]   And her supporters know that they like that too.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.300]   That's how most of them are,
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.460]   at the minion and even controller level.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.980]   They're preying on people.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.940]   And they want you poor and they want you stupid
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.500]   and they want you broke and they want you unhealthy.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.220]   I'm just coming to grips with the fact
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.860]   that they're not becoming more evil now.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.300]   They're being forced to reveal
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.200]   who they always were in the media.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.060]   They don't let you into it now
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.280]   unless you're a soulless, evil piece of filth.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:00.280]   And the good news is their whole system's falling.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.980]   The bad news is that's gonna induce them
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.180]   to support the end of the free press
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.100]   because the only place they can exist
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.740]   is in a controlled medium
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.020]   where they're not allowed to have competition.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.020]   And that's what they say themselves.
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.140]   So they're coming for us this year and next year
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.980]   and get ready because history's happening.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.460]   No matter what happens with Donald Trump,
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.100]   he's only a manifestation of that.
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.620]   And I'm not a lesser to evil guy,
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.120]   but let me tell you something.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.900]   Shooting your mouth off to your biographer
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.340]   20 years ago about a nice piece of tail.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:34.620]   Shooting your mouth off about women
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.540]   throwing themselves at you
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.300]   when you're basically a movie star.
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.060]   When they have a double standard
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.060]   and all this other horrible stuff Hollywood does,
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.700]   including sexualizing children,
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.260]   that's all supposedly okay.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.900]   But then when Trump, who's never claimed to be
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.680]   a perfect snow-driven lily,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.500]   does some stuff years ago
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.880]   and they turn it into the biggest issue in the world,
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.260]   it's all a giant fraud.
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.380]   And you know what?
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.220]   I'm not even gonna listen to the next stuff
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.320]   they got coming out, and you know they do.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.660]   Because it's all a joke.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:08.140]   It's all the devil, the literal devil,
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.940]   telling me, the beast system,
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.140]   telling me about somebody they hate,
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.140]   'cause he's against them,
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.380]   about some of the little sins he's committed.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.780]   Which he has repented for publicly,
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.680]   which they've never apologized for.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.140]   The raping of women and the settling of the cases
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.320]   and all the evil.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.420]   I don't wanna hear it.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.740]   And I don't wanna hear the usual suspect,
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:32.580]   fake Republican, fake Christianoid garbage
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.880]   that go to Bohemian Grove and have gay orgies.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.420]   I don't wanna hear from you
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.220]   about how he's immoral,
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.740]   having high school talk about women.
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:42.840]   I don't wanna hear it.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.700]   I don't wanna hear your moralizing from the pulpit
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.180]   with these government-run churches.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.820]   You can't vote for Trump.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.500]   You know, and the whole Glenn Beck thing.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.220]   Glenn knows what they've got on Trump.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.340]   He knows what's coming out.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.240]   He thinks he's bet on the right horse, the establishment.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.060]   We're gonna play the James O'Keefe clips here,
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.920]   but first off, we need to fund this operation.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.420]   We've got free shipping running tonight through tomorrow,
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.780]   and that's it for the final showdown debate.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.140]   We're gonna be covering live straight through.

[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.060]   That's 12 noon Eastern,
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:19.060]   right through to past midnight tonight, central.

[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.260]   You can see that, the president attacking
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.180]   is Hillary of the UN.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.360]   I mean, we know what we're doing.

[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.300]   It's been sold out for a couple of months.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.020]   It's harmful organism cleanser.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.580]   You've heard the callers calling about it.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:50.720]   It's amazing.

[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.180]   The reason that happens is it's got a whole bunch
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.860]   of ingredients to source them all organic
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.900]   then have them all pass California standards upon testing
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:23.300]   is the reason this is a very complex formula.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.600]   It's got a lot of herbs and known compounds
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.200]   to flush out the body in a healthy, clean, easy way.

[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.100]   Kind of redundant though.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.420]   It is at cost for $9.95 when shipping is being applied,
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.060]   but I guess now it's not at cost.
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.980]   So truthful, I just got to even touch something on here
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.420]   'cause we did another special that overlaps another special
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.340]   and it's a very affordable, put it to you that way.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.260]   $9.95, those are going to sell out.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.900]   We also have the Don't Tread on Me.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.740]   Okay.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.220]   The limited edition Don't Tread on Me
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.420]   locker up at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.000]   And please support our local affiliates as well.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.460]   Now, before I go any further here,
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.860]   I want to start getting into this James O'Keefe
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:34.000]   because it's so critical that everybody understand
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.520]   that the White House is saying there's no election fraud.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.400]   It doesn't exist.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.400]   It's not happening, but then mainstream media will not air
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.880]   the video he has with the national director
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.200]   of the main organization that has met 300 plus times now.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.680]   It was 200.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.160]   The number's growing, we've learned.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.520]   As the records are being examined via foyer
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.800]   by Breitbart, 340 times at the White House.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.480]   And he's got his top minion on video saying,
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.980]   we do whatever we want.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.460]   We do this all the effing time busing in people to vote
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.300]   over and over again.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.620]   Does it matter if journalists catch us
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.080]   'cause the media won't cover it?
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.280]   I mean, you are seeing all of this
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.080]   and it's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.680]   New bombshell video just released by James O'Keefe
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.500]   on massive voter fraud.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:18.440]   And it's all up on drugsreport.com.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.280]   It's all up.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.440]   On infowars.com.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.080]   Get them out to everybody.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.480]   This is so important.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.600]   This is about the integrity of our Republic.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   Let's go to part one.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.440]   Here it is.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:34.680]   - It doesn't matter what the fricking legal and ethical
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.000]   people say.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.520]   We need to win this mother (beep)
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.400]   - Hillary like is aware of all the work that you guys do.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.240]   I hope.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.760]   - The campaign is fully innovative.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.640]   - And then they tell Hillary like what's going on.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.840]   - Well, I mean, Hillary knows who's in command.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.680]   - Yeah.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.160]   - I'm not suggesting we wait her out.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.320]   We need to start this (beep)
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.360]   right away.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.200]   - Okay.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.120]   - On every one of these fronts.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:53.960]   - Okay.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.400]   - What I call this conflict engagement.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.960]   (laughing)
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.720]   - That's your version of reenfranchisement.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.240]   - Conflict engagement in the lines at Trump rallies.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:08.320]   We're starting anarchy here.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.080]   - This is part one of our undercover investigation
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.200]   into the dark backroom dealings
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.760]   of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.120]   The culmination of a year long investigation
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.160]   infiltrating the machine from the bottom
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.000]   all the way to the White House.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.600]   There are concerns this election will be rigged.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.320]   What you're about to see will make you uncomfortable
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.520]   and angry.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.520]   It's graphic, uncensored and disturbing.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.320]   Our attorneys say there is strong evidence of criminality.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.720]   And this is just part one.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.440]   - Love it for union guys.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.800]   - Yeah.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.640]   - Oh yeah.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.480]   - You won.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.320]   - They're rocking me.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.800]   - You know I'm basically deputy rapid response director
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.560]   for the DNC for all things Trump on the ground.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.320]   Nobody's really supposed to know about me.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.720]   - You know what I'm saying, we have mentally ill people
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.200]   and we pay to do (beep)
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.040]   Make no mistake.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.600]   - It's gonna be Caesar Bargains.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.960]   - I got a priest to cry on camera once.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.760]   - You know Brad and Bob and Lux and myself
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.360]   are all part of the old school method
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.280]   where it doesn't matter what the fricking legal
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.920]   and ethics people say.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.160]   We need to win this mother (beep)
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.640]   - So Bob is really good friends with them
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.760]   and talked to him this afternoon.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.760]   And they're all in if we can get 25 grand, they're all in.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:35.960]   - There is a narrative that supporters at Trump rallies
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.240]   are violent and dangerous, looking to beat up protesters
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.800]   who don't agree with them.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.400]   But our undercover investigation
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.960]   with the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party machine
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.920]   reveals a very different story.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.880]   - If you're there and you're protesting
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.400]   and you do these actions,
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.200]   you will be attacked at Trump rallies.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.040]   That's what we know.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.480]   - Oh, so that's part of the process
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.280]   of getting the reaction.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.440]   - The whole point of it is we know that Trump's people
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.840]   will freak the (beep) out,
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.440]   the security team will freak out
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   and his supporters will lose their (beep)
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.840]   - This is Scott Fogle.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.200]   He is the National Field Director
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.440]   for Americans United for Change.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.840]   He used to work for People for the American Way,
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.560]   an organization funded by George Soros.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.520]   He also has his own company called the Fogle Group.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.600]   He is one of the dark operatives for the Clinton campaign.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:26.680]   - And it goes on and on and on.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.440]   And if you're a radio listener,
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.640]   the arrogance in this guy's eyes,
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.160]   the feeling of we're in charge, we're the boss.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.000]   It's like a spirit.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.800]   They all have this crazed, hateful, sniveling wimpiness
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.680]   that they then wanna puff up and then again, run our lives,
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.600]   tell us how to speak, tell us how to live.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.960]   And they're always nastily, giggling and simpering
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   and like criminals out of a cartoon.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.800]   But when you study criminology,
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.400]   that's really how these people act.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.840]   And I don't care who they are or what they're doing.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.880]   I mean, Keith can walk into acorn after acorn facility
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.480]   and go, I've got child sex slaves.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.720]   They go, fantastic.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.960]   We're ready to run the op right now.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.880]   All right, I'm bringing these sex slaves in
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.840]   and we wanna just pay the taxes
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:12.880]   and give the Democratic Party money.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.160]   We'll help you run the op.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.960]   Yes, sir.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.200]   And I read the op-eds with one at CNN this morning
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.280]   about thank God America's not about to be white anymore
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.240]   and whiteness is evil and we gotta watch them.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   But now it's okay to stand for the flag
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.920]   'cause now America's brown.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.160]   I mean, it's getting weird, folks.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.440]   I mean, this is freak azoid.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.120]   Now here is Matt Dubiel
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.920]   who is the station manager and news director
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.800]   of one of our great affiliates
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:46.640]   that's been carrying us, I think,
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.600]   for five, six years in Chicago.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.960]   And he was one of the people that had like,
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.200]   I think it was like seven, eight, nine million
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.640]   last time I checked, cell phone video that he got.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.840]   And he also had some other higher def stuff
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:53:59.680]   that his wife got.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.240]   They're down there at the famous Chicago one
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.520]   that the media blamed on Trump.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.800]   And he saw it and it was all their people attacking.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.360]   If it wasn't for his footage getting out
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.640]   and a few others, it would have sold
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.120]   that it was actually Trump people that did it.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.560]   But we knew day one.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.040]   And then from our sources discovered who was behind it.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.480]   Turns out we were dead on as usual.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.760]   That's why they hate our guts, folks.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.760]   We know we're on them.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.840]   And our investigators, O'Keefe's investigators,
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.360]   linking up with Drudge and others
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.120]   is an unstoppable team, folks.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.800]   Let's play the next clip.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.880]   - This is what they're not really talking about
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.720]   at that event.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.440]   It was a peaceful event until the moment
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.240]   when they announced that it was canceled
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.720]   or postponed for safety concerns.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.600]   And then you saw all the people that were in the crowd
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   that were virtually sleeper cells.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.800]   And I don't wanna use that term
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:48.640]   because I know that they were-
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.480]   - No, that's what it is.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.680]   They're hired by George Soros.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.000]   He's taking credit.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.120]   Hillary, and they're blaming Sanders.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:54.960]   It's incredible.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.160]   They had paid them to do it.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.120]   They're under orders.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.760]   They're mercenaries.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.720]   And they go in and they do this.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.200]   And as soon as they knew that happened,
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.440]   okay, now we're not gonna disrupt Trump.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.720]   Now we're gonna activate
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.480]   because our threats worked to shut it down.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.120]   And now we're gonna cause a melee
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.440]   so they can run headlines saying
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.520]   the most dangerous place to be in the world
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.800]   is a Trump rally for a chilling effect.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:21.800]   That's Matt Dubiel, station manager at AM 1530 WCKG.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:26.840]   Again, AM 1530 WCKG.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.840]   I'm never really good about plugging our affiliates
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.760]   and appreciating them properly.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:31.840]   I apologize to all of them.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.040]   They're all such great people and such patriots.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.680]   I'm just so busy battling the new world order
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.800]   and trying to keep track of what's happening there
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.400]   that I never really service our affiliates properly.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.440]   But I'm gonna try to hire some people here
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.040]   in the next few months to actually start trying to do that
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.080]   with the affiliate relations.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.520]   So we're just very thankful,
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.360]   but know that I'm in the middle of a battle,
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.720]   just like you're in the middle of a battle.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.160]   So you're very much appreciated.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.000]   Some of the listeners,
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.920]   so many listeners send emails and don't get responses
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.640]   'cause we don't really do auto responses.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.680]   And they get pissed off at us.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.760]   Listen, none of it's personal, folks.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.200]   I am just fighting 18 hours a day right now.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.360]   Understand that we're at the parapet at the Alamo here.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.800]   We're going on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.800]   We'll defend this Republic,
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.560]   but just know that we are all overworked.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.240]   We're all basically punch struck at this point
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.080]   and just moving forward.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.880]   I just wanna thank you all for your support.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.040]   Now let's go to the latest clip.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.280]   Now again, it's 16 minutes long.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.920]   It's up on infowars.com.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.520]   You wanna see the whole thing.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.200]   That is Vogel being questioned by their investigators
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.440]   about voter fraud, election fraud.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.440]   'Cause when you organize a bunch of voters
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.840]   to engage in fraud, it's then election fraud.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.680]   Individual doing it is voter fraud.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.440]   Organized voter fraud is election fraud.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.360]   There's also electronic election fraud.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.520]   So three different types.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.120]   Rigging the election, video two, mass voter fraud.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.320]   Let's start playing a few minutes of this
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.280]   while this guy that's smarter than everybody else
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:55.320]   talks about stealing our Republic and robbing democracy.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.720]   - The question is whether when you get caught
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.000]   by a reporter, does that matter?
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.440]   Because there's a training investigation or not.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:08.680]   In this case, in this state, the answer is no.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.920]   Because they don't have any power to do anything.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.680]   - So this is sort of maybe not stuff for the general,
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.920]   but stuff to maybe pull off until--
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.920]   - No, I think you can do it for the general.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.560]   No, I think you can do it for the general.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:22.840]   - You have multiple states.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:23.680]   - Okay.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.440]   - So what you do is you implement the plan
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.000]   on a much bigger scale.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.920]   You implement a massive change in state legislatures
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.960]   and in Congress.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.400]   So you aim higher for your goals.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.880]   And then you implement it--
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.320]   - Good question.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.040]   We're gonna come back in the next five minutes
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   and I'm gonna play more of this,
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.960]   but I wanna back up to the start.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.080]   Battleground Texas is part of this.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.640]   And they caught them a few years ago in Texas saying,
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.600]   "We're gonna have all the illegals
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.840]   "and everybody else vote 10 times.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.760]   "Texas will go blue."
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.760]   This is a military take-up.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:03.600]   And you heard him saying,
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.720]   "We're doing this now at the state legislature level.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.680]   "We cannot be stopped."
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.320]   And then he looks at the camera person and says,
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.200]   "What are they gonna do?
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.680]   "We're in control now."
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.480]   This is called tyranny, folks.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.800]   We're in control.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.200]   We're above the law.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.440]   By the way, guess what Hillary did at the foundation?
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.160]   Nobody cares if she stole billions of dollars
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.160]   from Haitian kids.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.240]   It's 'cause they're liberal.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.680]   It's okay to kill 'em,
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:26.760]   'cause liberals are doing it.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.360]   Turns out they stole the furniture
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.360]   from the State Department too.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.280]   And there was an FBI investigation of that.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.520]   I mean, these are criminals
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.760]   with incredible criminal energy.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.840]   They are a criminal force.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:39.680]   Stay with us.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.000]   (dramatic music)
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.160]   And the Republican establishment is protecting 'em.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:45.280]   Remember that.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.120]   Remember.

[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:11.800]   it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:24.880]   Infowars.com folks.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.520]   They're not censoring that yet,
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.600]   but they're trying to.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.440]   Google and others,
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.480]   that's come out in new documents being released.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.920]   They're planning to take over the web.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.680]   CNN and others are now cutting satellite feeds
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.680]   whenever WikiLeaks is brought up.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.640]   And Drudge just has the entire devastating
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.240]   rundown on that.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.840]   New Bill Clinton sexual assault accuser
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.960]   goes public for first time.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.160]   There's video of that.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.160]   We're gonna be playing that coming up.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.600]   WikiLeaks dump number 12,
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.960]   Podesta email reveals cozy relationship with Hollywood
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.800]   and how they're directing the news media.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.680]   Soros mentioned 50 times.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.840]   Memo, Google, Schmidt working directly with the campaign.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.800]   Well, they've already pledged that
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.440]   to manipulate traffic and cover up stuff for Hillary.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.320]   Imagine how busy Hillary's people are.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.280]   They run the New York Times.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.680]   They run all the major networks.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.920]   All stories get approved,
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.400]   that deal with their agenda
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.560]   from global warming to the campaign.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.040]   And then they also tell Google what to do
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.120]   with search terms,
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.800]   like delist Donald Trump completely.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.640]   Remember that?
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.600]   And then we expose it like whack-a-mole.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   Then they stop for a while, but pop back up.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.320]   I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.680]   We're actually in a battle with authoritarians
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.320]   trying to completely take over.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.920]   And they say next, they're gonna shut us off next year.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.000]   I'll never stop fighting, but okay.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.720]   The American people want that.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.920]   I mean, I guess I'll just boy,
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.040]   (indistinct)
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.320]   Okay, whatever.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.120]   All you idiots out there
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.880]   that think you're gonna get some free stuff now,
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.240]   they are gonna rape you financially.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.360]   Woo!
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.800]   Man, you get ready.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.560]   Oh boy, I tell you what, get ready.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.120]   You've never been raped like you're about to get raped.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.920]   I mean, they have got their knives out.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.160]   They're sharpening them.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.120]   It's like a big old Christmas hog that got laid out.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.480]   Trump wanted to cut taxes 50% and make you rich.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.720]   I can rap now.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.560]   They have their way.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.080]   They're gonna hurt you good.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:21.760]   There's a new video, O'Keefe,
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.360]   that explains how the Dems commit the fraud.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.520]   Just exactly what Larry Nichols keeps saying.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.920]   We go to the poor areas.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.960]   We got a list of dead voters, people that don't vote.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.320]   We load people on, poor people, black, white, doesn't matter.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.080]   We take them to different polling places
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.840]   and they vote 10 times a day, Alex.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.680]   We've been talking about that for a year.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.720]   That's what they're doing now.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.600]   They're loading the buses up, Alex.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.320]   And they're doing the early voting, Alex,
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.760]   and they're gonna vote again.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.320]   But we don't need him to help get the Clintons
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.840]   actually elected and was their handler.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.160]   We have the national director, the head guy funded
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:03.080]   340 times at the White House the last two years.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.200]   And here's his main adjunct, Mr. Vogel, bragging.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.200]   Let's play some more of the Veritas piece.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.320]   The question is whether when you get caught by a reporter,
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.280]   does that matter?
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.720]   Because there's a training investigation or not.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.720]   In this case, in this state, where the answer is no.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.200]   Because they don't have any power to do anything.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.960]   So this is sort of maybe not stuff for the general,
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.680]   but stuff to maybe pull off until-
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.160]   No, I think you can do it for the general.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.760]   No, I think you can do it for the general.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.120]   You're building multiple states.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:37.960]   Okay.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.720]   So what you do is you implement the plan
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.320]   on a much bigger scale.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:49.240]   You implement a massive change in state legislatures
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.200]   and in Congress.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.720]   So you aim higher for your goals.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:01.480]   And then you implement it across every Republican
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.640]   Republican state.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.360]   That's the deputy director of people's legislation.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.040]   So starting on the grassroots.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.600]   No, that's enough.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.440]   (crowd chattering)
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.800]   Now coming up, I'm gonna play more of this.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.080]   They talk about how to bring the buses in,
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.880]   how to have people vote 10 times a piece, all on video,
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.120]   and how they're organizing it nationwide.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.960]   And he looks right at the person filming him and goes,
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.680]   with a hidden camera and goes, "What are they gonna do?
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.480]   "We run the state, we run the laws, we run the country.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.840]   "There's nothing they can do."
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.040]   And he is on such a power trip.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.120]   It's his to steal his election.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.440]   He runs it now.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.360]   I mean, good God.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.680]   But just like Nazis, they're run with an ideology
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.320]   where they're the good guys.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.680]   And he's just all excited and like gripping his glasses.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.160]   We run things, they can't stop us now.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.240]   See, they've got the FBI, they've got the courts,
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.560]   they've got it, they've got it.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.600]   They think they do.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.040]   Who cares if journalists catch it on tape?
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.160]   What are you gonna do?
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:04.520]   - There's an article up on our website on infowars.com
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.880]   written by Clifford Cunningham that addresses
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.960]   one anonymous Navy official
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.280]   telling Alaskans prepare for war.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.240]   This official suggests that Russia is preparing an invasion
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.960]   in response to US strikes.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.840]   He's unnamed, but he's warned the residents of Alaska
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.080]   to prepare for an invasion in the event of war
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.640]   between the US and Russia.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.720]   This is what he said.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.320]   We're on the verge of being invaded from Alaska
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.800]   all the way down into Canada
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.360]   and eventually to the Northwest.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.240]   He said the invasion will begin via submarine
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.720]   near the city of Wasilla,
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.720]   approximately 43 miles northeast of Anchorage.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.000]   Wasilla is located along the coast of Nick Arm,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.720]   a body of water that branches into the Cook Inlet,
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.000]   which flows west into the Gulf of Alaska.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.160]   He goes on to say our feeling in the Navy
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.720]   was that Obama has turned Alaska into a defenseless area
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.160]   that will serve as a forward base of operations
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.760]   when World War III begins.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.080]   I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowars.com.

[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.760]   He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.600]   - Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.920]   The American system of justice must be changed
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.680]   to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.600]   Individual rights will have to take a back seat
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.720]   to the collective.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.680]   Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.200]   It's gonna be coming after you, right?
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.040]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.120]   - I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way, at all.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.200]   It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.440]   - Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.560]   - It's time to ride, boys.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.520]   We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.840]   - When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag,
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   heritage, mom and apple pie, and beef was for supper.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.840]   Revelation, dawn of global government,
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.120]   theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.

[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.160]   Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.560]   Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.840]   Let's fix it.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.480]   - Please listen carefully,
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.560]   because I'm about to point out three things
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.120]   that will save you a lot of money

[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.480]   because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.040]   the products that you need each month.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.640]   Just go to infowarestore.com,

[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.560]   when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.080]   - Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.960]   It's Alex Jones, coming to you live
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.600]   from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:27.520]   - Now he's a busy guy, so I'm not gonna keep him long,
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.360]   but just like we talk about James O'Keefe
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.960]   and Project Veritas, devastating the criminal
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.600]   Democratic Party and the Republicans
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.720]   that work hand in glove with them.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.800]   Joe Seals just started right side broadcasting,
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.520]   I don't know, in the last year,
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.200]   because he was just simply wanting to see Trump's speeches,
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.200]   but the media wasn't caring all of them.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.640]   He went out, discovered it, how he could hook up,
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.080]   how he could subscribe to the feeds,
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.400]   began putting it up there,
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.920]   and now is funding just via donations
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.000]   a whole launch of a radio/TV network
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.720]   that already reaches millions of people every day now.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.880]   And again, this is how we defeat the globalists.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.760]   We build our own system, we tune out of them,
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.500]   and we build such a tsunami of new media
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.380]   that they have big trouble shutting us down.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.820]   And we educate people to value independent new media.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.440]   That's what it all comes down to,
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.280]   right side radio on YouTube or rsbn.tv.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.120]   A lot of folks are saying,
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.080]   "Why do you have Michael Savage on
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.820]   promoting his show and his book?"
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:30.160]   I'm not charging him to do that,
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.000]   or why do I have these folks on?
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.560]   Because we're all in this together, folks.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.920]   We have foreign megabanks funding,
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:40.720]   organizations run by Robert Cramer,
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:47.240]   national organizations, top Democrat organizations,
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.240]   with Scott Foval and others,
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.160]   running around bragging,
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.960]   "Yes, we've got illegals voting.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.120]   Yes, we're busing in people to vote 10 times.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.840]   It doesn't matter 'cause we control the press
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.960]   and the police, and we're above the law."
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.640]   I mean, I just played that clip twice in the last hour.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.800]   And they go on in this long 16-minute video
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.600]   about just, he grips his glasses and shakes with pleasure
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.240]   and says, "And there's nothing they can do to stop us.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.760]   We run everything.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.680]   And we're gonna overthrow all the legislatures
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.880]   of the states now, and we're taking over."
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.520]   And then we're like, "Hey, you better have an ID to vote.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.880]   People are voting over and over again."
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.600]   And they go, "That's racist.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.480]   Hey, Obamacare doubles and triples prices.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.880]   That's racist.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.000]   Hey, you're starting war with Russia.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:34.840]   That's racist.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.720]   Hey, you're funding jihadis and slaving women.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.680]   That's racist."
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.920]   That's all they do.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.160]   WikiLeaks comes out, and it turns out
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.600]   Hillary's meeting with foreign banks
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.800]   for the takeover of the US and bringing us into bankruptcy.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.240]   Trump covers it last Friday.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.720]   And what did the national media say?
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.160]   "That's racist!"
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.920]   They said, "That's anti-Semitic."
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.920]   They said, "Alex Jones and Donald Trump."
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.040]   That was the main ones last week.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.560]   "They're anti-Semitic now."
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.680]   What?
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.560]   That's right, we're against George Soros,
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.760]   so we're anti-Semitic.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.120]   George Soros is a fricking Nazi collaborator
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.200]   who rounded up thousands of his fellow Jews on record,
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.880]   went on "60 Minutes" and said he's not ashamed of it.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:20.720]   What parallel dark satire universe am I living in
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.400]   that I'm anti-Semitic because I'm against some freak
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.640]   who the new James Bond villain in the last movie
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.160]   is based on, MI6 helped write the script.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.000]   They hate him.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.240]   He tried to overthrow England.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.320]   He brags about it.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.680]   He's a monster who just overthrew Ukraine.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.440]   He brags about it on CNN.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.640]   We're against him overthrowing our country,
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.040]   and we're anti-Semitic?
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.760]   Then fine, call me that!
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.000]   You people are scum is what you are.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.120]   Now, I wanted to get Joe, he's a busy guy.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.040]   He's a humble guy, I didn't even want to come on.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:53.880]   But I said, "You know, come on,
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.640]   "talk about what you're doing, how exciting it is,
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.760]   "where this is going."
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.360]   They've got the debate tonight with their feeds.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.960]   We've got the feeds as well.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.240]   We're gonna be here.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.320]   Great part is they shut us down, they're up.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.440]   We need more of this.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:10.480]   We need more resistance because we're this close to winning.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.640]   Joe, I mean, do you agree with me that really,
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.840]   nationalism, the tide is rising?
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.080]   We've got a Nigel Farage interview coming up, by the way.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.240]   David Knight's about to conduct that.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.800]   We're gonna have that for everybody soon.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.920]   He's out in Vegas.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.360]   I mean, so much exciting things are happening, sir.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:28.120]   - Absolutely, Alex, and it's really good to be with you.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.400]   We appreciate everything you do.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.920]   We're big fans of yours here at Right Side.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.520]   And you know, it really is just,
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.360]   you know, it's gonna take people like us,
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.680]   just regular, average, normal guys
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.920]   to do the job that the media won't do.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.440]   We're fed up with it, we're tired of it.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.160]   We have noticed our broadcast, you know,
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.360]   getting so many more viewers over the last several months
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.960]   because people finally are waking up
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.640]   and seeing this corrupt crap that's going on.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.640]   For all to see, they're not even trying to hide it anymore.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.480]   And I think that people are finally,
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.760]   thank God, starting to wake up to that.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.680]   And I mean that because we've seen people flock to us,
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.680]   we've seen people flock to InfoWars,
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.360]   to, you know, people who are finally, you know,
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.600]   deciding to come out and just say, "Enough, enough."
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.480]   And that's why we started Right Side,
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.000]   is to give an alternative to all the crap that's going on,
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.360]   which just, I mean, it's just disgusting.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.000]   - Well, Joe, what makes me so exciting is,
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   and I wanna talk about your success story,
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.760]   not to brag about you, I know you're a humble guy,
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.000]   but as a microcosm for others.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.200]   I mean, you were a stay-at-home dad.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.000]   I mean, I've got your bio right here, like a year ago.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   And then now you're reaching, conservatively,
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.920]   15 million people a week.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.200]   I mean, I can go see your numbers on YouTube alone.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.760]   We're reaching 30 million a week.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.320]   I mean, I hope you reach 100 million, 5 billion.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.800]   We're gonna beat these people,
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.240]   but it's down to the wire, folks.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.120]   It's down to the wire, and people have to understand
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.760]   that we can defeat the globalists,
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.640]   but we've all gotta get aggressive.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.120]   And it may be putting a bumper sticker on your car,
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.360]   it may be calling to talk radio,
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.820]   or starting your own podcast, or whatever it is,
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:06.440]   or it might be legal stunts.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.920]   I mean, $100,000 we put out,
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.120]   to go out and yell Bill Clinton's a rapist,
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.640]   if you ideologically believe that, which he settled cases.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.880]   This is war, folks.
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.680]   They want a war, they're getting one.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.520]   Go ahead, I mean, tell folks about your success story.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.400]   - Absolutely.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.320]   Listen, you're right, it is a war.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.600]   And we all have to come together.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.600]   Drudge, Infowars, us, Breitbart.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.280]   There's a lot of new media out there
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.680]   that are doing some really good things.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.360]   And it's taking--
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.400]   - And America is fighting for its life.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.520]   That is not rhetoric.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.920]   We are fighting for our lives here, people!
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.720]   Actual, hardcore, evil people are taking over
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.880]   that wanna hurt us.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.720]   We're not getting conquered by Boss Hogg.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.880]   We're getting conquered by really bad people.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.960]   Go ahead.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.780]   - Right, because we, you know, look,
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.820]   we didn't wanna do this, I didn't wanna do this.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.220]   I had a nice life.
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:01.420]   And my life over the last year has been,
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.240]   I don't spend time with my family anymore.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.960]   And the reason I justify this every day
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.480]   is because I want my kids to grow up in a world
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.320]   that makes sense.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.840]   I want my kids to grow up in a world
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.960]   that is free of all this tyranny
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.080]   that's going on right now.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.600]   And this is, I don't see my family anymore.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.000]   And these guys, listen,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.320]   let me tell you something about our company.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.440]   The guys that are out there traveling the country
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.360]   following Trump around,
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.980]   we have cameras at almost every event now.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:31.080]   We're talking about lawyers, EMTs.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.980]   These are people that don't have formal experience
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.760]   in media who just decided enough is enough.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.960]   They may not be the best at what they do.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:40.960]   The camera working was,
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.600]   but the key is to go out and show people the movement.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.120]   - Hey, I wasn't good at it 20 something years ago
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:46.960]   when I started.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.680]   And again, they say necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.940]   And what's so beautiful about this, Joe,
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.320]   is that they've pushed too far.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.720]   And as you said, they're forcing people to finally unify.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.680]   And the sleeping giant is rising.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.400]   I mean, you were a successful businessman,
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.760]   but you were in between jobs in this economy,
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.160]   a stay at home dad.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.200]   And then you started this in July of 2015.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.320]   And so now a year and a quarter later,
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.200]   look at what you're doing.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.720]   Let's talk about that.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:18.540]   - Absolutely.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.480]   We have a hundred million views almost now
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.640]   on our YouTube channel.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.080]   Our Trump speeches consistently get hundreds of thousands,
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.680]   some of them millions of views.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.440]   We're also, you know,
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.160]   thanks to people like Matt Drudge,
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.960]   who have begun linking to a lot of our Trump rallies
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:34.800]   and speeches.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.640]   And, you know, I want to bring up another point
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.560]   is that, you know, Drudge said the other day,
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.680]   he sent out a tweet that was very telling and very true,
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.400]   which was that, you know,
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.720]   the mainstream media can't cover a lot of this
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.640]   WikiLeaks stuff because so much of it involves them.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.920]   And people like CNN openly telling their viewers
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.240]   the other day, you know,
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.160]   oh, you can't look at this stuff.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.000]   It's illegal.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.600]   You can't look at it.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.160]   And people are starting to call BS on that.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.400]   And we are just,
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.280]   we're just so happy to be a part of all this.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.200]   And, you know, bringing this to life.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.800]   And look, this is not about us.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.640]   I don't care.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.920]   I'd like to be successful.
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.640]   I'd like to make money,
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.520]   but this is country first.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.240]   - Okay, we're not going to have a platform
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.800]   that allowed us to be successful
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.400]   if we let these globalists take it.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.080]   And again, let's be clear.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.240]   Let's be a hundred percent clear.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.600]   Your feeds, a lot of times,
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.200]   aren't even picked up by the media,
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.840]   but because you pick up the feeds,
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.480]   then they get put on other channels
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.120]   and reach tens of millions more like our channels.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.560]   So when you talk about reaching a hundred million people,
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.340]   brother, it's way more than that.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.560]   And that's exponential.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.640]   And again, it's the fact that you took action
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.040]   as one person and now have hundreds of people
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.880]   working through you and with you
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.280]   just in a volunteer operation,
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.040]   but the expenses get paid and you're turning the tide.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.920]   This is a game changer.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.760]   - Absolutely.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.480]   This is the thing, you know, it's so true.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.560]   When we go, and I've been to some of these Trump rallies.
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.720]   Now, and I sit right there in the press pen
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.880]   with all the rest of the still enter it there.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.680]   And they refuse.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.520]   This is, you know, the one thing that got us,
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.460]   I said, you know, let's go to these events
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:08.020]   and start shooting instead of just paying
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.500]   for access to the feed.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.840]   Let's go because Trump would always say
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.700]   the media never shows the crowd.
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:14.600]   And it's true.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.440]   You see him-
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.940]   - And they weren't just cutting the crowds.
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.780]   You've caught them.
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.020]   They cut the feed a lot of times.
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:20.860]   - They cut the feed.
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:22.740]   - When the black preachers and the black folks
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.860]   are running up, hugging Trump,
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:25.580]   and there's this great moment and Trump has tears
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.420]   in his eyes and everybody's coming together.
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.940]   You hear Reuters go, cut it, cut it, cut it now.
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:30.780]   - Absolutely.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.400]   And we actually offered that cameraman from Reuters the job.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.280]   I never heard from him.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.140]   I hope he's okay.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.540]   - He says, no, he goes, no, you can fire me or whatever.
[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:39.780]   I'm filming this.
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.340]   And they go, nope, that's it, cut it, cut the feed.
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:43.180]   - Yeah.
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.740]   So, and I think he refused
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.700]   and they finally just shut the feed internally.
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.540]   So, but the thing is we wanted to show the massive crowds
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:51.360]   at these events.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.900]   You're talking about 25, 30,000 people at these events.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.620]   And it's as simple as, you know, spinning the camera around.
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.620]   I've seen Trump call, you know,
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.060]   turn those cameras around and show them.
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:04.440]   And, you know, the guys are sitting down in chairs.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.080]   They have a producer's line open
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.840]   and I know what's being said to them.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.880]   Don't move that camera.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.600]   A lot of these people want to.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.000]   I've talked to these cameramen myself
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.640]   who work for some of these big networks at the events.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.080]   My guys talk to them all the time
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.600]   and they say, you guys are the future of the media.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.320]   You guys, I know that they like us.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.840]   And I know that they, some of them are even Trump supporters
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.520]   but they have direct orders not to spin the camera.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.360]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.960]   And now this is coming out.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.880]   We have dozens and dozens of videos.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.620]   Now we ought to do a compilation video
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.140]   about when America became authoritarian,
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:38.060]   where CNN, MSNBC,
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.580]   when somebody talks about Bill Clinton and rape,
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.700]   somebody talks about Bill Clinton and corruption
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.100]   or Hillary Clinton and WikiLeaks, they cut the feed.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:49.580]   So here's Cuomo from his storied family of corruption.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.420]   Here he is on CNN and he's saying,
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:55.740]   "You're not allowed to look at WikiLeaks.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:56.580]   "It's illegal.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.300]   "You've got to go through us."
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:00.420]   And then it cuts to yesterday
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.060]   when somebody brings up WikiLeaks
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:05.220]   and they literally cut the feed and he makes a joke about it.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:06.780]   This is what we're talking about.
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.980]   And folks, they're not just gonna do this in mainstream TV.
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.300]   They're coming for us next
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:14.140]   because we're already bigger than them and they know it.
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:14.960]   Okay?
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.700]   And every week there are new people popping up
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:17.980]   that are incredibly successful.
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.380]   They're in panic mode.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.260]   There are high school students, folks,
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:23.260]   that are putting out videos weekly
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.520]   that get an average of 10 million views.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.580]   Some of them get 60 million views per video
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:29.520]   that are political.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.340]   The Daily Show doesn't get that many viewers in a month.
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:34.340]   They're crapping themselves.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:35.180]   They're in panic.
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:36.940]   They must shut us down.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.120]   We are winning.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.420]   They are losing.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.500]   Trump's 15 points ahead in general polls.
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.900]   That's why he says it's all rigged
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:45.060]   'cause he knows when they've got a Reuters poll
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.460]   that samples 40-something percent more Democrats
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:50.380]   than Republicans, who's gonna win that poll, folks?
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:52.980]   I mean, they think we're so fricking stupid.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:53.820]   Excuse me.
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:57.460]   I'm ranting with the CEO of Right Side Broadcasting.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.300]   Go ahead, sir.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.440]   - I wanted to say, I wanted to let everybody know
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.720]   that the Trump campaign is also finally
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.300]   getting wise to all this.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.880]   And they are tonight, for the first time,
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.600]   and this is the first time I'm actually announcing this,
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.760]   and I hope it's okay with them that I do,
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.800]   but they are tonight going to take their message
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.040]   straight to the people
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.120]   after the debate is over with tonight.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.700]   We know what CNN's gonna say.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.240]   We know what MSNBC's gonna say.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.280]   We know what they're all gonna say.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.500]   Hillary could fall down and die on the stage
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.420]   and they would say she won.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:30.940]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:33.220]   And so tonight, the Trump campaign
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:36.260]   is holding their own post-game debate show
[01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:39.220]   with their people, and it will be a live exclusive
[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:40.780]   on Trump's Facebook,
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:43.020]   and we're the ones that are gonna be there filming it.
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:46.420]   You can also see it on rsbn.tv, our website,
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.100]   but we will be there right after the debate.
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:49.940]   - And I should add, you're graciously allowing us
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:50.980]   to have your feed as well,
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:53.300]   so we'll be able to simulcast with you.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:54.140]   - Yes, sir.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.060]   - That's wonderful. - Absolutely.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.480]   - So no matter where you get it,
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.840]   over at Rideside Broadcasting or Trump's Facebook
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.400]   or InfoWars, more channels just means more people,
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.600]   our audience, their audience, all together.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.120]   And listen, we have over a million tuning in on our streams.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.840]   You've got millions, Trump will have millions.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.920]   Watch, we'll end up probably having 10 million viewers
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.440]   to the post-game with Trump.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.840]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.600]   - That is amazing, and this is what it's about.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.120]   It's about finally breaking that stronghold
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.960]   that the mainstream media has,
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.700]   and we're doing it one viewer at a time.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.720]   And with this broadcast,
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.500]   we're gonna reach tens of millions of people tonight.
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.940]   And this is what it's gonna take.
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:31.380]   It's taking people like us that have finally had enough.
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.620]   And I'm telling you, there's a growing number of those.
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.420]   - Wow, Joe Seals, this is so exciting.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.900]   Thank you for announcing this here.
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:38.260]   Take a few minutes to talk about it,
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:39.900]   then I'm gonna put a report out.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:40.860]   That, I mean, this is great.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.580]   No, in fact, it's good to announce this.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:45.120]   Trump is going to just ignore the mainstream media,
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.260]   wade through 'em, go into Rideside Broadcasting,
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:50.820]   and boom, have his own press conference.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.300]   This is genius.
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.380]   Oh my gosh, please lay it out for us.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:57.020]   - So, okay, so it's not actually Trump,
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.820]   but all of the members of the campaign,
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:01.780]   all the surrogates, we're having people like Giuliani,
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:04.980]   all those people will be taking their message
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:08.300]   directly to the people via Facebook
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.980]   and also through our website.
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:10.820]   - But I would imagine Trump
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.780]   will probably come over too, knowing him.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:16.260]   - He may do so, and we'll be ready for him if he is.
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:19.460]   The broadcast will begin about five or 10 minutes
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.900]   after the debate is over with.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:23.980]   We'll be live from the spin room in Las Vegas.
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:27.140]   We got two camera guys out there ready to go,
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:30.780]   and we're gonna take the message straight to the people
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:34.540]   and say, you know, look, the mainstream media,
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.100]   we know what you guys are up to.
[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:36.940]   - Well, that's perfect.
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:39.300]   Link up with David Knight 'cause he's out there.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.300]   He's interviewing Nigel Farage right now.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.420]   So certainly I'd like to get David Knight in there with you,
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.300]   and we'll be going back and forth
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.060]   between our feeds and your feeds.
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:46.900]   Amazing.
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:51.060]   - RSBN.tv, RSBN.tv, Joe Seals.
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.620]   Joe, since you mentioned it,
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:55.220]   let me play this clip of Cuomo saying,
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.100]   you only get WikiLeaks from the media.
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.580]   You, the citizens, aren't allowed to see the corruption
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.480]   that, by the way, CNN is involved in,
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.020]   getting direct orders from Hillary and covering stuff up.
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:05.900]   So he's saying, you don't dare look at this
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:07.300]   or we'll arrest you.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.000]   I'm a knuckle-dragging thug.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.540]   Next day, they cut the feed on somebody
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:13.420]   talking about it, here it is.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.660]   - Also interesting is, remember,
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:18.500]   it's illegal to possess these stolen documents.
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:19.500]   It's different for the media.
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.780]   So everything you learn about this,
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.540]   you're learning from us.
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.020]   And in full disclosure, let's take a look
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.420]   at what is in there and what it means.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:27.460]   Joining us now, CNN.
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:30.260]   - Well, on the character issue,
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:32.740]   the public, two-thirds or more of the public
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.100]   knows that Hillary Clinton's a liar.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.220]   She can't be trusted.
[01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:38.860]   And now the two faces of Hillary Clinton are coming out.
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:42.100]   The fact, through WikiLeaks, that she says one thing,
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.260]   (beep)
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:45.300]   Oh no.
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.380]   All right, let's see if we can get Congressman Collins back.
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:49.540]   Obviously, we just lost the satellite feed.
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:50.980]   That sucks.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:52.780]   - By the way, folks, satellite feeds don't go,
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.980]   do, and put up color bars.
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:56.380]   That's their new thing.
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.240]   When someone doesn't like something,
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.360]   you just cut 'em off.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.420]   So there's the congressman being cut off.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.700]   That's why we have Right Side.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:03.740]   It's why we have Infowars.
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:04.820]   It's why we have Drudge.
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.980]   It's why I want everybody to start their own TV networks,
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:09.780]   because out of this will come the new media
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.340]   based on honor and justice and freedom and liberty,
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.460]   and hopefully never again will we rot
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:16.340]   and turn into something that makes Pravda,
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:19.020]   you know, 50 years ago, look truthful.
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.100]   - Absolutely.
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:20.980]   Absolutely.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:21.820]   And I need to also,
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.460]   there's something else going on tonight, too,
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.100]   that I can't announce on air right now,
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.640]   but I wanna talk to you about it off air,
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.340]   or give the information to somebody
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:30.700]   that we'll be covering also tonight,
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:31.540]   an hour before the debate.
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:34.020]   It's a big event that's gonna take place
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:35.900]   right before the debate, about an hour before,
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:37.580]   so a press conference.
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:39.140]   And I wanna talk to you about that on the air.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:41.460]   You guys are welcome to use our feed of that as well.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:42.300]   - Thank you, sir.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.500]   - We're gonna be going to break here in a few minutes,
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.180]   so I'll talk about that war game with that,
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:48.300]   and our head producer, lead producer, Nico Acosta.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.500]   So we'll talk to you in about three minutes,
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.340]   then let you get out of here,
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:51.380]   'cause I know you're a busy man.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:55.980]   Joe Seals, RSVN TV CEO, started about 16 months ago,
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.340]   now reaches hundreds and hundreds
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:58.780]   and hundreds of millions of people,
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.820]   and is totally freaking out.
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:02.140]   We have the head of CNN in the Wikileaks,
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.900]   but also in public statements saying
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.180]   he should have never covered any
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:07.020]   of Trump's statements or rallies.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.800]   So again, they're now admitting
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.440]   that they're trying to black this out.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.620]   That's why what we're doing,
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:13.980]   what you're doing is so essential.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:18.140]   - Absolutely, and as I said before,
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.460]   we're completely supportive.
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.580]   This is another thing,
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:24.900]   just for the same reason that Trump did not take donations
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:28.940]   from during the primaries, he's a political outsider.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.140]   We're media outsiders.
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.420]   We don't take money from,
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:33.380]   I've been approached by venture capitalists.
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.380]   I've been approached by people
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:37.420]   who own bigger media companies
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:41.420]   who want to be involved in our operations somehow.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:42.740]   I know what that leads to,
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.060]   so we refuse it every time
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.100]   because we're not gonna have anybody telling us
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.820]   what we can and can't have or say on our own network.
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:50.320]   This is the people's network,
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.140]   just like you guys over at InfoWars are doing.
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.580]   We are solely funded by the donations from our viewers.
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:59.980]   - And by the way, that's how I started out early as well,
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:02.140]   and then I went basically to direct sales of products
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.260]   to fund ourselves.
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.660]   Other people are now following that model.
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:05.740]   I would suggest you guys do that
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.740]   with more than just coffee mugs or T-shirts.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:08.580]   Those are great.
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.880]   I would go full on with self-funding
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.500]   because during a war like this,
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.660]   you can get the donations you need,
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:16.460]   but during lean times, when things aren't as hot,
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.780]   you've gotta really build the base for the next big war.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.580]   And so that's why it's so essential
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:24.100]   people make donations there at your site
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:25.340]   and support the work you're doing
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.140]   'cause you can do so much more
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:29.340]   if more funds come in, correct?
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:31.860]   - Absolutely, and it's only because of the viewers
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:33.860]   and the donations that we're able to travel.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.340]   And I tell people this all the time
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.260]   that other than the YouTube ad revenue,
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:40.180]   which you know isn't that great,
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:43.120]   we are funded by people who,
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.800]   when they pay and they donate to us,
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   we have a PayPal account,
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.560]   we have an address they can mail donations to.
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:48.960]   It all goes into one fund,
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:52.280]   and it's only for travel and for equipment
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.440]   and purchasing so that our guys on the road
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.000]   can have the things that they need.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.640]   And I understand our goal is to be relevant
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.720]   after November 8th when all the Trump speeches stop.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.520]   We're working on building a network.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.080]   We hope to be able to work with you guys
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.680]   on some of that stuff.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:12.760]   We're adding new shows, we're adding new programming.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.040]   We have some pretty big names
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:17.360]   that are gonna come to our network after the election.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.800]   Some people that have been in the news lately
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.360]   that I can't talk about right now,
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:23.160]   but these people will be coming to our network
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.320]   and having their own shows.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.880]   We already have two shows, as you know,
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.720]   Wayne Dupree Show, which is final cast live on RSBN
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.520]   nine o'clock Eastern time on weekdays,
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.280]   and also Pastor Mark Burns has a show on Sunday.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:38.480]   And so what we hope to do is to
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.400]   do what you guys are doing and follow your model.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.480]   And you guys have been incredibly influential on us
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:49.320]   when we look at our business model and what we wanna do.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.920]   And so we hope that you guys will also play a part.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.720]   - You bet brother, it's very exciting.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.260]   Well, listen, they're coming for our guns,
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.120]   they're coming for our kids,
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.920]   they're coming with forced inoculations.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.520]   It's all in the WikiLeaks, it's worse than we thought.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.660]   I gotta tell you, InfoWars, our crew, our guests,
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:06.280]   our research has been so validated, not tooting our horn,
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.520]   but everybody that bet on us to support us
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.280]   the last decade like Drudge and others did
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.400]   to help build us up,
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.280]   understanding we've gotta have a resistance.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.600]   It's time to pay that forward onto others
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.280]   to build the infrastructure to really beat this.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.320]   Because let me tell you something,
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.320]   I've studied history and I've lived a lot
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.360]   and I've seen a lot.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.840]   The crop of evil we have running things right now
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.840]   is the most wicked, twisted threat ever.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:31.080]   And that's why it's so good to just grow the resistance
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:31.900]   and be part of this.
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:33.120]   And we're so close to winning folks,
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.260]   but they are coming out to the free press.
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.220]   The answer is innovate where they can't stop us
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:42.080]   and to support InfoWars, RightSide, Drudge, and everybody
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:46.080]   because we are in a war for basic liberty.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.520]   This is a complete and total survival operation.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:50.920]   - We're on the march.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.680]   The empire's on the run. - It's life and death, folks.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.520]   It's all about survival.
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.920]   - Alex Jones. - Like Trump says,
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.200]   it's over. - The GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.040]   - It's over.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.220]   If we don't stop them.
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:03.720]   - Tonight, tune into InfoWars.com/show
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:06.400]   for live coverage of the big, epic last debate
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.420]   between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:10.780]   We're starting our pre-debate show at 3 p.m. Central,
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.300]   right after the main transmission.
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.380]   So if you're already watching the Alex Jones Show,
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:15.540]   just continue watching.
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.680]   At 7 p.m. Central, we'll go over what to watch for
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.640]   during the debate.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.820]   And the debate starts at 8 p.m. Central.
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:22.740]   Now this debate is not just about Donald Trump
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.660]   versus Hillary Clinton,
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:25.460]   but rather it's about how the shadow government
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.540]   is finally uncloaking before our very eyes
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.780]   to destroy U.S. sovereignty.
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.060]   The latest WikiLeaks emails reveal the inner workings
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.500]   of the global elite who are forging
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.460]   an authoritarian society dominated by technocrats
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.040]   and government technology and media,
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.400]   whose claim to power rests solely on their arrogant belief
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.360]   they are superior to the rest of society.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.720]   These elites say in control use of military conflict,
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:44.920]   which begs the question,
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:47.520]   will they force the U.S. into a nuclear war with Russia?
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.640]   Will 2017 mark the beginnings of global tyranny
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:50.840]   or the renaissance of liberty?
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.680]   Again, tune into InfoWars.com/show tonight
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.120]   for a live debate coverage starting at 3 p.m. Central
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.800]   with the debate at 8 p.m. Central.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.080]   This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.120]   - Rainforce, it's completely different.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.320]   Try a bottle of it.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.900]   Rob Due joins us.
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:08.060]   You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.140]   Tell us what Rainforce did.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.100]   - I'd been working all day.
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:12.580]   I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:14.540]   I get in here at 8.30.
[01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:15.940]   I was kind of run down.
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:17.820]   You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:20.140]   And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.580]   I got my bottle of Rainforce right there.
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:22.500]   I popped two of 'em.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.540]   And about 20 minutes later, it's like,
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.940]   bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.340]   - It's got four and a half stars.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:29.620]   People really love it.
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:31.980]   Read about it, find out why third party
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:34.080]   pharmaceutical sites give it such high praise
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:37.600]   because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.600]   that will blow your socks off.
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.120]   - I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.640]   but I probably could not have done it without Rainforce.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:46.040]   I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.720]   took three hours of sleep, got up,
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.760]   took two more Rainforce and came in.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:53.360]   - You will find Rainforce and other game-changing products
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:58.360]   at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.040]   - Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.560]   - Because of what we did on this day,
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.080]   change has come to America.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.720]   - Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.640]   I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:16.120]   - The nation has been hijacked by international forces,
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.360]   bent on global governance.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.880]   - When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag,
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.560]   heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:28.040]   God was in school, morality had a future,
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.800]   and beef was for supper.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:33.800]   Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.840]   - We're the solution, Americans.
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:37.440]   Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:40.200]   - Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels,
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:42.880]   and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.680]   Theatrical screening's on demand.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.440]   DVD's now available.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.960]   Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.840]   Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.600]   Americans need to see this film.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.280]   Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:32:59.360]   Let's fix it.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.200]   (rock music)
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.840]   - The globalists' great error is to believe
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:11.560]   that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:14.600]   The truth is, humanity is coming down fast,
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:18.760]   but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:23.720]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:29.880]   ♪ Do you don't wanna love you ♪
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:33.840]   ♪ I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you ♪
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:37.600]   - Only 19 days to the epic general election.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.320]   Freedom versus tyranny, nationalism
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:44.960]   versus the global scourge of the New World Order.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.120]   I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.760]   We have more of the James O'Keefe video
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.280]   because we got Larry Nichols on the line right now,
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.960]   former Clinton insider.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:56.720]   Can you guys reprint me the big Inquirer article
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:58.400]   that was on Drudge yesterday?
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.440]   I wanna go back over that.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.000]   I know Nichols is one of the sources on that.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.040]   He told us on air months ago this was coming out,
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.880]   but I wanna get into what's gonna be coming out
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.480]   in this issue that I get set to come out tomorrow or so,
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:11.320]   or maybe even today.
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.000]   I went and checked the local grocery store
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:14.880]   and couldn't find one today.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:15.920]   Maybe it's about to get stocked,
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.480]   but Hillary's fixer breaks ranks.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.560]   I arrange sex trust for her with men and women.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.520]   I know Nichols is one of their sources on the vote rigging
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.120]   and bringing people around to vote 10 times.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.440]   But before we go there, it's just important to add
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:35.920]   that we now have the Democrat Party high ups on video
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.160]   admitting they're engaged in election fraud.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.000]   And exactly what Larry Nichols talked about,
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.040]   busing people around.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:43.200]   We're gonna play part of that,
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.360]   the latest James O'Keefe release as well with Larry Nichols.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.520]   But before we go there,
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:52.080]   free store-wide shipping on all items
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:56.080]   from non-GMO heirloom seeds to books, to films,
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.480]   to all the nutraceuticals,
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.480]   to Hillary for prison shirts,
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.680]   Molan LaBe shirts,
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.200]   store-wide free shipping for a limited time.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.680]   We're doing this because obviously
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.520]   we have the final debate tonight,
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:14.720]   and it's important to get folks to try
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.760]   some of these amazing products.
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:21.120]   By the way, I had this idea to do it a week ago,
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.120]   and we already got it made, it already happened.
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.960]   Trump is my president, a limited edition shirt
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.840]   that will only be sold through the election.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.560]   And that means you've got to order it now,
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.440]   so you get it, we're 19 days out.
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.080]   Trump is my president.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:40.440]   It's a red shirt, so you can go to the polling place
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.560]   and be seen in your red shirt.
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:47.800]   So it's very, very clear that Trump is the winner,
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.840]   especially in battleground states.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.240]   So that shirt, 1995, limited edition,
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.240]   is available at Infowarsstore.com
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.320]   or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.440]   No reviews because it just,
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.560]   I just had the idea last week,
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.080]   started making them last week.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.400]   They have now been produced.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.160]   They're now being 18-wheelered here,
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.920]   so that'll start shipping out later this week or next week.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.800]   That's why you've got to get your order in now.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:19.720]   It is a total limited edition.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:20.760]   In fact, I moved so quick.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.680]   Does it have anything on the back?
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.920]   I don't think I even,
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:25.360]   I was wanting Infowars.com legalized freedom.
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.200]   Yeah, it does.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.360]   Yeah, let's see the back, good.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:28.240]   I mean, so much happens.
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.480]   Yeah, there it is, Infowars.com legalized freedom.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.160]   This is an absolute one-time limited edition
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.600]   because a lot of folks have had the idea.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.600]   I don't even know where it came from,
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.600]   but to wear red, to point this out that you're red state,
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:46.640]   Infowars.com legalized freedom,

[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000]   If you want to get those,
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.440]   they're available right now for 9.95.

[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.960]   It's so hard to procure all the different ingredients.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.360]   It's back in stock.

[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:36.640]   from right side broadcasting.
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.280]   I have everybody on who I think is pure of heart
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.880]   and having a big effect at taking action.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:46.480]   We're gonna lose if this is just about Infowars.
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:48.160]   We're gonna lose if this is just about Drudge
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.940]   or Breitbart or WorldNet Daily or Daily Caller.
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.960]   And none of us are perfect.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.580]   The Democratic Party is the leading edge
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:56.720]   of the takeover right now, worldwide.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.840]   Trying to start a war with Russia, you name it.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.400]   I interviewed Jill Stein a couple of days ago
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:04.080]   and she concurred that they're trying to start a nuclear war.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.120]   So, it's essential.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.280]   (silence)
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:19.080]   Worst thing we can do around here
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:22.600]   is have them bring me jalapeno sausage during a break.
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.400]   Just wanna put a article up on screen
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.960]   or something for a sec, please.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:33.840]   I don't believe anything comes out of Hillary Clinton's mouth
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.560]   except that she says she has allergies
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:39.200]   and it makes her cough and it's been raining
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.520]   more than it has in decades here in Texas.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.880]   And so, we've had an incredible bloom of different plants
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.720]   and I like to hike almost every morning.
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.480]   I didn't this morning.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:54.800]   Let me tell you, it inflames the,
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:57.840]   I guess the bronchioles or whatever, also the esophagus.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:02.360]   And then you get jalapenos or pepper on that,
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.080]   which I was eating a little bit of during the break.
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.040]   And it will hit you and hit you hard.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.160]   So, that was what was just happening right there.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.200]   Well, it kinda feels good though
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.680]   once you get the little piece of pepper
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:13.240]   or jalapeno out of your throat.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.080]   Okay.
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:18.400]   Now, Larry Nichols, again, has been the source
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.960]   for a lot of the big Inquirer reports.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.720]   I know that he's been talking to the Inquirer.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:22.640]   That's been on record.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.920]   But there are obviously some other sources involved
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:26.680]   in this new big report we'll put on screen
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.160]   and they're gonna bring me a printout of it
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:29.840]   here in just a moment.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.120]   But Larry, you keep hammering
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.120]   that they're gonna bust people around
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:34.120]   and steal the election.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:37.320]   We now have high level Democratic Party operatives
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:40.800]   on video saying that nobody's gonna enforce the law.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.600]   We don't care if the press catches us.
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.080]   We're just gonna steal this election.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.680]   And by the way, we're gonna steal all the states too
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.000]   and take over the country.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.400]   And he just has this crazed power trip look in his eye.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.720]   Who the hell are these people, Larry?
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.880]   You totally predicted this.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:58.000]   - Well, Alex, the people are the machine.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.880]   They're the people behind the Clintons.
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:03.080]   And remember, they're the proxy group.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.360]   They're the people, I heard one of the little clips
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.000]   and it was, that's why I know the guy was telling the truth
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.480]   because he said, you know, we've got these different blinds.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.560]   It's a double blind so you can't get it to Clintons.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.080]   If somebody gets caught, well, it wasn't them.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.600]   And they always set up people
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:22.040]   that'll fall on their sword for them.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.400]   So this is the machine.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:28.200]   You know, I warned Alex, I tried to warn Donald Trump.
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.600]   When you start running against Hillary,
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.440]   the world's gonna change.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:36.720]   It's not gonna be, your world's gonna come upside down.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.560]   Well, look what's happened.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:42.400]   Look at how they have done everything in their power,
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:44.920]   not just to beat him in the election,
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.760]   but to destroy this man.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.440]   And they're going to cheat.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.520]   They are going to, you know how I know
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:54.240]   there's gonna be massive voter fraud?
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:57.240]   They're forecast, I mean, they're showing you
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.080]   there's gonna be massive voter fraud.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:04.160]   And it's the way they are lying about the polls.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:07.520]   You see, they're showing Hillary way up in the polls,
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.160]   seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 points ahead.
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.880]   And the reason they're doing that, Alex,
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.760]   is to justify when the actual election is run.
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.520]   If they were showing that they were dead even,
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:25.120]   and then all of the sudden she wins by 11 points,
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.720]   people are gonna be suspect.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.720]   But they know they're gonna be bringing people in
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.000]   in massive numbers.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.920]   They're gonna bring them to the inner cities.
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:35.960]   They're gonna bust them in.
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.680]   They're gonna ban them in.
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:41.960]   And just think, just think going from precinct to precinct
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:44.960]   and inner cities, bring 100 people in,
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.760]   and each one of them vote four or five times.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.600]   Think about the massive number of votes
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.600]   that will accumulate.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.800]   And you know what?
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.360]   That guy's right.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.920]   We don't care if we get caught.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:59.680]   Number one, is the media gonna say anything about it?
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:01.680]   No, they've proven that.
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.880]   Number two, who are you gonna call
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.840]   in the Justice Department to do anything about it?
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.360]   No one.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.520]   They've already proven that.
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.320]   You know, people have no idea, Alex.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:15.240]   When Hillary, if she gets elected,
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.200]   and I still pray to high heaven she does not,
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:21.280]   but if she gets elected within 90 days
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.200]   of the day she's sworn in,
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.040]   this country will be changed forever, forever.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.560]   Because they will use blackmail and extortion
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.160]   on every governor, every lieutenant governor,
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:35.080]   every congressman, every senator.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:37.920]   - Well, that's what Scott Fovel says on the tape,
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.680]   and he's the national director.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.880]   He starts salivating and says,
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.440]   "And next we're taking over the legislatures."
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.360]   - They will.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.720]   They will indeed.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:50.720]   Now let me, may I give just a quick example of a poll?
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.560]   - Yes.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.520]   - Show that you got proof.
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.840]   Yesterday, I couldn't help but notice,
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.640]   here comes a poll on Fox,
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.160]   and it's by Wall Street Journal and NBC.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:03.160]   And the reporter on Fox, or the host,
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.120]   was saying, you know, this is a good poll.
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.360]   Basically, he was saying it was the gold standard of polls.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:11.160]   Well, I went and looked at the internals of that poll.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:14.000]   You see, Alex, people don't do this.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.520]   But you go in, and it said they had,
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:21.080]   it said they had interviewed 905 people,
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.800]   and that it had a plus or minus accuracy of 3.2%.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:28.680]   Well, that's funny, 'cause when you look inside,
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:31.560]   there are three categories of respondents to a poll.
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:32.880]   Number one is a hangup,
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.880]   that somebody hangs up and doesn't take it.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:38.880]   Number two is interview.
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.280]   Interview means, folks,
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:43.000]   somebody that started out taking the poll,
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.560]   but then for whatever reason quit.
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.240]   And then you have respondents.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:50.640]   Now, respondents are the only people, Alex,
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.280]   you count in a poll.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.160]   Statistically, that's it.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:58.720]   And a respondent is somebody that answers 90% or better
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:01.400]   of the questions in the survey.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.240]   Now, do you have any, now, 905, you know, nationwide,
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.560]   that's not a very big sample anyway.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.480]   But do you know how many people actually were respondents?
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.320]   492.
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:16.680]   492.
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.400]   When you use the standard basis
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.040]   by figuring margin of error,
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.680]   that puts it at six point margin of error plus,
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.920]   which means statistically that poll is zipped.
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.720]   - But I mean, for me, that is a gold standard
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:31.600]   compared to the other ones,
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.560]   where they'll get 40, 50, 60, 70% more Democrats
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.280]   in the sample than they do Republicans,
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.680]   and they admit in the methodology they're doing that.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.960]   This is ridiculous.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:42.720]   - Well, that's what they did in this poll.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.400]   When you look at the poll,
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.880]   what you find out is 60% of the people
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:52.600]   that completed in that 492, 60% of them were,
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:56.640]   guess what, Democrats, to 40% Republicans.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:57.480]   - And how do you get them
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.640]   to get the Republicans to hang up?
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.600]   I'll tell you, it's on record
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.480]   that I've got a few of these over the years.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.840]   As soon as you start answering the way they don't want,
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.840]   it just disconnects, the phone disconnects.
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.240]   That's how they kick you out,
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.920]   and that's how they get more Democrats.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:11.880]   - That's how you find out what happened
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.400]   to that 400 that they started out interviewing.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.160]   Most of the time, you would think that 400
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:20.960]   would be people that hang up on the interviewer.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:23.960]   No, what happened when somebody gives the answer
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:26.600]   they don't like, they hang up on 'em.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.680]   They hang up.
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:29.280]   Now, it's linear.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.840]   Every question in that poll that related to,
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:35.080]   do you want Hillary or Trump,
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:38.440]   do you think Hillary's a better leader than Trump,
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:39.600]   or Trump a better leader,
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:42.400]   every question that was relevant, guess what?
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.880]   60-40, 60-40, 60-40.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:50.600]   I'm telling you, the polls are rigged.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.360]   - Well, Larry, that's indisputed,
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.280]   because that's how I was able to finish your sentence,
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:55.880]   even though I hadn't seen this particular poll.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:57.280]   They've gone to a new level of fraud.
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.280]   Normally, they would have the independent vote,
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:01.640]   really know those were Democrats,
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.600]   skew it by demographics,
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:06.900]   or CNN just says, "Call us if you wanna be in the poll,"
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:08.100]   then they cherry-pick who they want.
[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:09.240]   So there's different ways they do it,
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:10.360]   but only two or three different ways,
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:12.960]   as you know, as an expert that was involved in this.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:15.240]   My question is, what are they gonna do
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:18.400]   when the internal polls show Trump five to 15 points ahead,
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.340]   depending on which battleground state you're in?
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.080]   That's why he's saying it's rigged,
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.920]   because his internal polls show he's still ahead.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.240]   He did lose some in this big scandal,
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:29.040]   but when he came out swinging last week
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:31.480]   and did a good job of the debate, he stabilized.
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:34.540]   So he knows he really should win in a landslide.
[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:36.080]   He knows they have illegals voting.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.320]   He knows they have dead people voting.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.080]   So what does he do in the debate tonight?
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:43.480]   - What he has to do in the debate tonight,
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.840]   and I went on YouTube and just made a public thing to Trump,
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.820]   telling him what I think you should do.
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:50.440]   Alex, he has no choice.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.880]   Tonight, when he gets on that stage,
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:55.780]   although Chris Wallace seems to be affable,
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:58.880]   here's what Trump has to do.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.480]   When he gets on that stage,
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.240]   he needs to close his eyes, Alex,
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.080]   and pretend there's nobody in that room,
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.080]   no interviewer, no Hillary.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.280]   And when he gets two minutes,
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:12.080]   he needs to start talking about whatever the issue is
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:12.920]   he wants to talk about.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.040]   - He needs to say,
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.040]   I wanna talk directly to the American people.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:16.880]   - There you go.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.040]   - And say, if you're tired of the past
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:20.960]   and being ripped off and all the corruption,
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.160]   you've seen all the rigging and the fake polls,
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.840]   the demonization of lies.
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.000]   If you want a real change,
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.800]   the whole establishment's against me.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.000]   You've never seen anything like this.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.720]   It's because they've got it rigged, a bunch of insiders.
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:35.120]   I'm gonna bring in term limits.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:37.000]   I'm gonna cut your taxes.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.400]   It's basic stuff that'll bring this country back.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.920]   If you wanna go with the old mafia,
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.240]   you wanna buy their lies,
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.920]   you go ahead and vote for this lady right here.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.120]   But I'm here to tell you,
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.960]   our internal polls show I'm way ahead.
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:52.720]   Then they've got these polls where they sample 30, 40, 50,
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.000]   60% more Democrats in the poll,
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.440]   and then say that I'm losing.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.920]   Folks, the fix is in,
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.160]   and I'm asking the American people,
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.240]   I've been fighting for you,
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.600]   but you gotta fight for me,
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:03.840]   we're in this together.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.280]   - That's right, and he's gotta look right at the camera
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.600]   when they start hollering at him,
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.680]   Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, answer the question.
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:11.040]   Don't even hear 'em.
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.360]   Go on and finish your statement.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:16.240]   Look, somebody's gonna say, well, that's not fair.
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:18.880]   Let me tell you, this gathering tonight
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.520]   is not gonna be fair.
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:24.080]   If he whips Hillary every way but loose,
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.280]   the media is gonna spin it the next day.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.760]   You saw it happen with the second debate, Alex.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:30.960]   The next day, the media's gonna say he lost.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:34.040]   The next day, the media's gonna pull snippets out,
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.000]   and they're gonna spin 'em the way they want to.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.280]   So he's up against a stacked deck.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:40.680]   Have courage, look into that camera,
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:43.720]   realize this is the last chance, Alex,
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.520]   he has to talk to 50 to 60 million Americans.
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:49.520]   - And tell the American people it's their last chance.
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.360]   - That's right.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:51.180]   - And point at Hillary and say,
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:52.680]   you're a communist Chinese agent,
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:54.360]   you've been exposed with the shadow government,
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.640]   the WikiLeaks have destroyed you,
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:58.440]   you tried to bribe the FBI
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.160]   to say you didn't have classified documents,
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.040]   you should be in handcuffs right now
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:04.400]   for criminal espionage and racketeering.
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:06.200]   But since you mentioned it,
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.800]   here's the Project Veritas talking to the head
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:11.520]   of People for the American Way,
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:14.080]   the main Democrat organization out there getting voters,
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:17.080]   Scott Fovill admitting the buses, here it is.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:19.160]   - You know what, we've been busing people in
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:22.200]   to deal with (beep) for 50 years,
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:24.120]   and we're not gonna stop now.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.880]   - This is part two of our undercover investigation
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:29.080]   into the dark backroom dealings
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.280]   of the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:33.880]   Part one blew up on social media,
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.560]   with many Americans wondering why the mainstream media
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.480]   wasn't covering the story.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:40.200]   In fact, Project Veritas action
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:43.680]   had television exclusives lined up around the country.
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.920]   Those television stations spiked the story
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:47.520]   at the last minute.
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:49.960]   Our sources tell us the reason they did so
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:52.560]   was fear of retaliation and retribution
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.240]   from a future Hillary Clinton administration.
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:57.480]   Truth is dangerous,
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:00.360]   especially when it challenges those in power.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.280]   - All right, and then he goes on from there.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:05.560]   So they're on video bragging, and later he says,
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.160]   nobody's gonna stop us, there is no law,
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:08.320]   we run everything now.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:11.280]   We've reached the tyranny tipping point, Larry Nichols.
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:15.360]   - Yes, you know, Alex, you and I talked some months ago now
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.720]   about we are in a velvet coup.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:21.000]   We are actually in a coup d'etat.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.320]   As a matter of fact, the other night I heard Newt Gingrich,
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.840]   he was quoting some friend of his that wrote an article
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:29.520]   and said, Newt Gingrich said, we are in a coup d'etat.
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:32.000]   He said, they are taking it over
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.160]   unless we stand up.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.360]   That's why Trump has got to come forward tonight.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:39.040]   And he's got to tell it, he's gotta tell it all.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.480]   You know, the Russian thing, he needs to say,
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:44.680]   hey folks, they're claiming that WikiLeaks is Russia
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:45.880]   and I'm their big buddy.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:49.400]   Let me ask you this, to a sane, rational human being,
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:52.080]   if you were Putin, and here is Donald Trump
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.760]   that's gonna beef up our military,
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:56.080]   bring the military back to what it should be in the world.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:58.320]   - Stay right there, stay right there, absolutely.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:50:59.160]   Stay there.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.760]   - My name is Liam, I'm 41.
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:05.600]   I've been using One World Way for two and a half years now.
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.840]   I suffered a bulged L4 and L5 disc
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.840]   from a car accident three years ago.
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:12.800]   And since that time, I've been unable to walk long distances,
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.000]   do any minor lifting or just normal activities
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.840]   with my children without having severe back pain.
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.600]   Since I've started using One World Way,
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.040]   I've been able to walk more,
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.680]   engage in activities with my children
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:24.360]   and have less lower back pain.
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:26.800]   One World Way has helped me regain back my strength,
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.860]   confidence and have a healthier life.
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:31.080]   I've noticed a weight loss of about 20 pounds,
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:34.600]   my A1C dropped two points and I have more energy now.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:37.320]   One World Way has helped me regain back my life.
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.280]   - The results for clients on One World Way
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.760]   have surpassed the results for most any other supplements

[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:16.200]   I wanna get with him some of this big inquire piece.
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:18.480]   The WikiLeaks are so devastating.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.240]   The whole world is turning against Hillary
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:21.440]   and this crime syndicate
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:24.480]   because they know how dangerous she is.
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.360]   You were getting into the fact
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:27.120]   that he's gonna be in our military.
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:30.320]   Why then would Russia be more pro-Trump?
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:32.200]   Well, because they understand how dangerous
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.320]   Hillary and the neocons are.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:36.080]   Hillary now, it turns out in the WikiLeaks
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:39.000]   that the FBI was investigating her
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.960]   for stealing furniture from the State Department.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:44.880]   I mean, these people are incredible, stingy, trashy people.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:47.240]   I wanted to ask you about this though.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:52.240]   We have the chef on yesterday for the Clintons
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:54.480]   who worked for them for a very long time.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:58.760]   He said that they would call black servers the N-word.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.080]   They would call Hispanics names,
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.800]   but they would call other people names.
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:03.400]   And then also she wrote lots of notes
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.160]   calling people the N-word.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:07.600]   A former Clinton chef, again, that's up on infowars.com,
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:08.800]   Tracy Martin.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:10.720]   Larry Nichols, your experiences,
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:13.280]   what type of stuff did you ever hear come out of their mouths?
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.400]   - Well, let's see, how about calling Dickie Morris
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.840]   that little fat Jew bastard?
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:21.880]   How about every black person that came in,
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:26.400]   specifically one guy that was kind of famous at the time,
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.240]   what was his name?
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:29.200]   The head of the Rainbow Coalition?
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:31.480]   - Jesse Jackson.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.400]   - Jesse Jackson, they called him the N-word,
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.080]   left and right.
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:42.080]   And he and his N-word organization, yeah.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.720]   Now I've heard of them.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.080]   You don't have to be around them long
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:47.000]   until you hear that and worse.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.280]   Ask anybody that was working with the Clintons
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:50.600]   when they were president.
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:53.680]   Ask the people that were walking up and down the halls
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.640]   in the White House when Hillary would come by
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:59.160]   and they'd jump in a closet, not to have to pass her.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:02.360]   No, no, don't tell me.
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:03.200]   - Well, let's expand on that.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.520]   I've talked to people that were there,
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:07.180]   that Jesse Jackson, when he had to bring women or kids
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:09.080]   around Bill, that he would like say,
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:11.360]   "Watch out, now watch out, he'll grab you."
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.880]   And then he was actually scared of them.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:14.920]   - Absolutely.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:17.920]   And Ron Brown, you know, the head of commerce,
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:20.000]   killed out in the plane crash.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.560]   Would you know, you know why Ron Brown got to be
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.840]   the head of the commerce department?
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:27.400]   Because Bill Clinton had accosted his daughter,
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:29.760]   his 16 year old daughter.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:31.720]   And Ron Brown found out about it.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:35.240]   Well, then he gave him that appointment to cool him down.
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:38.040]   I mean, these people are, Alex, I've told you,
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.960]   we've told people, we've done everything we can
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:45.920]   to warn people, but they have got Joseph Gerber
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:48.320]   working for them, just as if he were setting
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:51.720]   in those offices, because they're doing
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:54.660]   just what we did when I was with them.
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:57.520]   You get control of the media, Alex,
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:00.120]   and you keep telling the American people
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:03.400]   everything that you said over and over and over.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:06.720]   - I was about to say, when you see the head
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:11.720]   and the deputy head of top democratic organizations,
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:13.900]   literally with crazed looks in their eyes saying,
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:15.320]   "We're gonna steal the elections.
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:16.400]   "We're gonna steal the country.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.360]   "It's all ours.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:18.960]   "Nobody can stop us."
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.440]   I mean, this is like a movie.
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.360]   I mean, these people are crazed.
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:25.160]   - They are, and you were talking about
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.480]   the stealing furniture out of the State Department.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:31.200]   Don't you recall when they left the White House,
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.640]   when George Bush was good enough
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:34.540]   to let them take Air Force Two?
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:36.960]   They stole stuff out of the White House,
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.640]   stole Washington's China.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.200]   They got fined $50,000 and had to bring the stuff back.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:44.040]   - No, I know.
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:46.520]   I mean, these are literally the daughter
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:49.960]   of an organized crime chief and a white trash scumbag.
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:52.160]   God, I can't believe it.
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:54.640]   - Well, but you have to believe it.
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:55.960]   You have to believe it.
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:57.560]   All of you have to know,
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:00.600]   and that's one of the things Trump needs to say tonight.
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:03.480]   Look, they say that I'm against all of Islam.
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:06.040]   Now, personally, Alex, I am, but that's me.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.320]   That's not Trump.
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:09.220]   And then he needs to say, "Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:10.380]   "you know what I said?
[01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:13.720]   "I said as long as we're bringing people in from Syria
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:15.800]   "that cannot possibly be vetted,
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:18.920]   "what I said was we need to halt all of that
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:21.980]   "until we get a system that can properly vet 'em."
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:23.800]   - I wanna ask you, 'cause you've been proven totally right,
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:25.440]   the next 19 days, what they're gonna do,
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.280]   what Trump needs to do,
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:29.840]   and more about the latest Inquirer information.
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:32.080]   But clearly, they're gonna try to steal it.
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:34.120]   How do we counter that?
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:36.960]   Wow, what a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:37.800]   We'll be right back.
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:38.640]   Stay with us.
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:40.820]   (dramatic music)

[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:14.000]   Waging war on corruption.

[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:19.880]   from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:27.460]   - Larry Nichols is our guest.
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:31.280]   Larry, we have the head of the New York elections,
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.640]   a Democrat, admitting fraud's going on
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:36.400]   with people being bused around the vote 10 times.
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:38.680]   We have the national coordinator for the Democrats
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:41.120]   at 340 times at the White House,
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:43.800]   admitting it and just openly saying,
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:44.880]   F them, we're taking over.
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:46.480]   I mean, it's very mafia.
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:47.880]   It's very aggressive.
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:49.360]   We played most of it in the first hour.
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.920]   It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:54.240]   How do we stop them?
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:55.480]   And then if they do get in,
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:58.440]   they do have that criminal energy now in their eyes
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:00.160]   that I've seen in old film footage
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:02.480]   of communists and Nazis and stuff.
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:04.320]   They're gonna make a craze run everybody.
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:06.680]   So all I can say is,
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:08.480]   boy, folks, I'm glad we got the Second Amendment
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.320]   to defend ourselves
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:12.040]   'cause they think nothing's there to stop them.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.200]   They're gonna go crazy.
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:17.160]   - Absolutely, I'll tell you how to stop them right now.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.920]   Now, folks, please hear me.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.540]   All of you fellow veterans,
[02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:26.480]   I need veterans organizations to gather up teams
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:30.760]   and you need to go to the inner city precincts in your town,
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:31.740]   your community.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.340]   Five, six, seven, eight of you, 10 of you.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:36.460]   - Because this is the true final defense of the Republic
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:37.980]   more than any foreign land.
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:39.300]   This is it. - Absolutely.
[02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:42.100]   Now, you go in there, it's not hard to spot.
[02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:44.940]   You'll see vans come up, you'll see buses come up,
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:47.260]   and you'll see the same people going in and out
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:49.620]   of that precinct over and over and over.
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:51.540]   When you see it,
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:54.100]   and the reason I say eight or 10 of you go in there
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:56.420]   because it's gonna be a little risky.
[02:01:56.420 --> 02:01:58.340]   You're going into the heart of the ghettos
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:01:59.620]   of these communities.
[02:01:59.620 --> 02:02:01.980]   They know it, they know you won't go,
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:05.420]   but veterans, go, get your teams together, go in.
[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:09.080]   And when you see it, instantly, that minute,
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.900]   record it on your phone, take a picture or two,
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:13.660]   and then call me.
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:16.220]   Call me, I'll get the word out instantly.
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:18.020]   We gotta catch 'em in real time.
[02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:19.340]   That's what you gotta do.
[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:22.460]   Now, when it comes to the push-button machines,
[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:24.780]   the touch voting machines, Alex,
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:28.500]   guys, everybody, when you go in
[02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:32.580]   and the voting machine is push-button, touch machine,
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:37.260]   you make them show you a printed proof
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:40.460]   of your votes being registered the way you cast 'em.
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:44.820]   And if they can't do that or tell you they can't do that,
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:47.920]   then you demand to have a paper ballot.
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:49.580]   Every place is supposed to have a paper ballot.
[02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:51.700]   - In fact, demand 'em by law, they're supposed to have it.
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:53.500]   In fact, just demand one every time.
[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:58.420]   - Now, if they say, well, we don't have paper ballots here,
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:01.300]   which is against the law, but they'll say that probably,
[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:02.980]   then it's simple.
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:07.500]   They'll tell you you need to go then to the city
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:11.900]   or the county courthouse, wherever the main place is.
[02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.580]   - The clerk. - There's a place you can go
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:16.220]   and get a paper ballot and cast your vote.
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:18.500]   But if they will not provide you proof
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:21.280]   on a touchscreen, computerized voting machine,
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:25.620]   which is owned by DieVote, which is owned by George Soros.
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:27.620]   - By the way, exactly more than half the ballots
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:30.860]   in the country are getting cast on companies he controls.
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:32.780]   - Absolutely, so I'm just telling you.
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:34.980]   - Bastard. - You can do it.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:36.260]   You can do it, but you gotta do it.
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:41.260]   And Alex, we forewarned, we forewarned, and it is now here.
[02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:47.800]   This is the vote that either wins our country back
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:51.060]   or at least protects it for a while longer,
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:52.780]   or we give it all up.
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:56.460]   Now, if she wins, you say, what do you do then?
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:04:00.580]   You know, he's talking about doing term limits.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:02.700]   You know, Alex, Congress ain't gonna vote for that.
[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:05.620]   You'd have to get a constitutional amendment.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:08.420]   You know, it takes two thirds of the states to vote for that.
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:09.260]   - We're almost out of time, Larry,
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:12.060]   but I wanna invite you back up for part two of this tomorrow
[02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:12.900]   if you can do it.
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:16.860]   I'm posting support you at NicholsLive@AOL.com,
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:17.700]   the important work you're doing,
[02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:21.060]   the organization you've got set up, NicholsLive@AOL.com.
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:22.700]   Let's get you to pop back in for 30 minutes tomorrow
[02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:25.580]   to talk about what we do, how we identify fraud,
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:28.140]   how we stop it, and then what is gonna happen
[02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:28.980]   if Hillary gets in?
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:30.900]   Because Trump's gonna win, folks,
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:32.540]   but they're gonna try to steal the ballot box
[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:35.300]   or announce federally, Homeland Security taking over,
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:36.900]   that he's lost.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:38.340]   But we've won by exposing him.
[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:40.580]   We've certainly exposed their operation.
[02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:42.540]   So, you know, we only lose by laying down.
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:43.760]   Larry Nichols, thank you so much.
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:45.460]   And you've been- - You bet, buddy.
[02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:47.180]   - You know what, I've got Gary Haven coming up.
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:48.220]   Is he still in Haiti?
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:50.940]   I don't think he's gonna mind
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:52.100]   getting backed up a few minutes
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:54.620]   because I need to get into this Haiti thing,
[02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:56.180]   but I'll see to ask Larry one more question
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:58.640]   about this whole thing.
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:01.500]   - We're red on election day.
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:03.540]   Perhaps the biggest election in American history
[02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:04.580]   is just days away.
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:06.140]   We know that in past elections,
[02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:08.260]   there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud
[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:10.300]   and election fraud, from dead people voting
[02:05:10.300 --> 02:05:12.580]   to people registering false identifications
[02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:15.020]   to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:16.620]   to give illegal immigrants votes.
[02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:18.260]   This is happening right in front of us.
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:20.780]   Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:22.780]   after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:24.740]   Government shills are campaigning for Clinton.
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:26.980]   Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day
[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:28.140]   like rabbit hounds.
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:29.880]   Rigged polls being broadcast daily
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:31.260]   to provide the fake optics
[02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:33.020]   that Hillary Clinton is actually winning
[02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:34.980]   and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:37.700]   Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:39.500]   So with all this, what are we doing
[02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:41.220]   to keep this election from being stolen?
[02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:43.200]   What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:45.140]   I propose that all Donald Trump supporters
[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:46.420]   wear red on election day.
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:48.260]   On November 8th, when you head to the polls
[02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:50.340]   to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:52.820]   This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout,
[02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:54.380]   we can prove and provide the optics
[02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:56.460]   that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:59.900]   Wear red on election day and make America great again.
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:01.620]   - I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:04.220]   Will you and your family be financially protected
[02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:05.900]   if there's another economic meltdown?
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:08.860]   Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:09.700]   is coming.
[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:11.500]   I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:12.960]   Don't wait for another crisis
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:14.420]   that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:16.980]   Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault
[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:19.940]   at 844-541-ALEX.
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:21.340]   It's a company I trust.
[02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:23.940]   They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs
[02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:27.340]   that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown.
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:30.620]   I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:32.500]   China recently bought more than a billion dollars
[02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:35.020]   worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:37.820]   Gold and silver are recognized worldwide
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:40.900]   as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:43.980]   Don't delay, call 844-541-ALEX now
[02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:46.100]   and get a rugged double-locked bank bag
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:48.620]   to securely store your coins absolutely free.
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:50.140]   These are dangerous times
[02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:53.380]   and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:56.060]   I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:06:59.580]   Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX now.
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:01.380]   We're selling a product, DNA Force,
[02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:06.140]   that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:09.300]   Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:11.240]   - It's been something that I've been working on
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:12.340]   for a long time, Alex,
[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:14.920]   because I think it's very, very important.
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:18.180]   What the aging process is is when the cell replicates,
[02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:21.020]   we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:24.260]   Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:24.260 --> 02:07:25.980]   - And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:28.900]   - We chose the PQQ because it has over 175
[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:30.220]   different clinical trials.
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:33.260]   It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:33.260 --> 02:07:34.860]   It works like an antioxidant.
[02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:38.300]   It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:40.900]   - So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:41.980]   It's in powder form.
[02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:44.780]   - We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:47.380]   I take this, this is the product that I take.
[02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:50.220]   Infowarslife.com and the profit we make,
[02:07:50.220 --> 02:07:52.060]   we fight the globals, we fight the new world order.

[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:03.360]   (upbeat music)
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:10.660]   - The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:14.100]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:17.620]   Gary Haben for part two of the interview
[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:19.820]   we started yesterday is gonna be joining us
[02:08:19.820 --> 02:08:20.880]   coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.660]   And we have a seven minute video we haven't premiered yet
[02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:25.580]   of the carnage in Haiti.
[02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:29.620]   And when I sit back and try to prepare my mind
[02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:32.420]   to say put out a video chronicling the Clinton's crimes,
[02:08:32.420 --> 02:08:36.380]   it's mind numbing.
[02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:41.380]   I mean, these are such truly nasty, greedy, horrible people
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:44.180]   that it's coming out that any building they're in,
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:45.860]   they just suddenly want everything in the building.
[02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:46.900]   They're kleptocrats.
[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:51.700]   They are truly governing kleptomaniacs
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:57.580]   who want your very life.
[02:08:57.580 --> 02:08:59.660]   I mean, they knew for a decade
[02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:02.540]   that they were shipping HIV, hepatitis blood out
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:04.420]   and having it mixed in a factor eight
[02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:07.180]   show everyone would get HIV and hepatitis that took it,
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:08.640]   the hemophiliacs and others.
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:13.300]   And people came to the Clinton's a couple of years into it.
[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:15.580]   And he said, and Hillary's like,
[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:16.780]   we're getting paid, I don't care.
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:20.780]   I mean, I interviewed the doctor who was at the hospital
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:24.900]   at the major prison who actually went to the Clinton's.
[02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:26.500]   Their response was to try to get him fired
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:28.140]   and then have his offices robbed.
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:31.000]   I mean, it's pretty hardcore folks to know
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.020]   you're gonna kill over a hundred thousand people.
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:35.000]   Conservatively, the Clinton's killed.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.860]   Other states, 'cause they had that big blood scandal,
[02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:37.900]   there were shortages of blood,
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:40.580]   wouldn't sell it out of the inmates stock
[02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:42.700]   'cause it was so many diseases.
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:45.220]   Well, they knew people had them and were doing it.
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:47.720]   And I go back to that, it's just like,
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:49.200]   man, these are bad people.
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:52.460]   Then it came out in the lawsuits, they knew.
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:54.600]   And so did the Bayer Pharmaceutical head.
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:58.660]   Came out in the court records, they said,
[02:09:58.660 --> 02:09:59.780]   sir, this is gonna kill people.
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:00.900]   They said, I don't care.
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:03.940]   Too many hemophiliacs, too many sick people anyways.
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:07.240]   And then all the witnesses to hurt.
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:09.340]   I mean, when a black person walks out of the room,
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:12.220]   she calls them an N-word or she'll do it to their face
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:15.260]   and hit Secret Service in the head with books
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:18.060]   and hit Bill in the head with ashtrays.
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:20.980]   I mean, you know, man.
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:25.500]   You know, the good part about it is that God appoints a man
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:27.660]   one life to live, 75 years on average.
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:29.360]   And you know, old Hillary,
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:30.820]   I don't think she's gonna make it to 75.
[02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:33.820]   And I don't wish her even personally any harm.
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:35.340]   I just want that demonic entity
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:36.940]   to stop abusing innocent people.
[02:10:36.940 --> 02:10:40.520]   But I think about them stealing.
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.500]   I mean, they got over 90% of the donations
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:43.420]   that were supposed to go to Haiti.
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:45.180]   Everybody sent it to them.
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:46.380]   'Cause they're liberals.
[02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:47.660]   They're good white people
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:49.740]   and they're gonna take care of the black people.
[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:51.720]   And they stole all that money.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:54.220]   And they started all these wars
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:56.420]   and they do all these bad things
[02:10:56.420 --> 02:10:58.260]   and they just are so wicked.
[02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:03.260]   But I guess we become an evil nation
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:04.580]   so that's who God's put over us.
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:07.380]   And I guess if we don't wake up and see through it all
[02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:09.340]   and Trump's not gonna be perfect,
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:12.220]   but he's not out to get us, then we deserve what we get.
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:13.060]   But here's the deal.
[02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:13.980]   America's doing the right thing.
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:16.220]   They're trying to elect Trump.
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:18.500]   You see the whole media and the whole system against him.
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:20.260]   You know, Larry Nichols, I'm gonna have you back up tomorrow
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:21.780]   'cause you've been proven right.
[02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:23.220]   You've been on target on all of this
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:24.420]   and I really wanna war game this with you.
[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:25.340]   I'd open the phones up too,
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:26.900]   but just in closing,
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:27.740]   'cause I'm gonna get Gary Haven on
[02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:28.940]   with the latest on Haiti.
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:32.980]   But Hillary Fixer breaks ranks.
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:35.820]   I arranged sex trust for her with women and men,
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:38.220]   but then it gets into all the other stuff
[02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:40.180]   that they were involved in.
[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:41.700]   And how crazy she is.
[02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:43.420]   How like in between events,
[02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:44.860]   she'll go in like a powder room
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:46.260]   and have sex with a woman or a man.
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:48.180]   I mean, it just shows an addiction.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:49.700]   She has to have everything.
[02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:51.780]   I mean, what is the psychology of these people?
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:53.340]   I know you've been involved with the Inquirer
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:55.060]   and some of their other big scoops,
[02:11:55.060 --> 02:11:57.140]   events foster files and stuff like that.
[02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:58.100]   Were you involved in this?
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:00.860]   'Cause this just smells like you're one of the sources.
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:01.700]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:03.820]   I was knee deep in the middle of all of that
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:06.460]   and helped do the background, helped do the research,
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:08.180]   helped to find a couple of people
[02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:11.140]   that are gonna be testifying in it or talking in it.
[02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:12.700]   Yeah, I was right in the middle of it.
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:15.420]   And of course, you know, I was one of the fixers.
[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:21.300]   You know, you can't get any higher up
[02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:22.980]   in their group than I was.
[02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:25.540]   You can't, and that's been proven over and over again.
[02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:26.380]   - Who are they?
[02:12:26.380 --> 02:12:27.860]   Because everybody I talked to says,
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:28.940]   it's like there's nothing there.
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:32.380]   I've talked to special forces people and Blackwater folks
[02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:34.180]   separately that did security details for her
[02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:35.740]   in Iraq and other areas.
[02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:38.420]   And they said that you'll get on a helicopter
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:39.820]   and a car or whatever,
[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:41.420]   and then she won't even talk to anybody
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:42.740]   unless she's cussing at you.
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:45.740]   And that she'll almost like a robot just switch off.
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:47.900]   She'll just switch off and like go into a trance.
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:51.020]   Did you ever see that or is that something newer?
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:54.420]   - No, I mean, she would just wig out.
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:56.180]   Alex, I'm just gonna tell you the one thing
[02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:57.260]   you know about it.
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:59.500]   I had to justify her going out to LA
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:02.860]   about every four to six weeks to a witch's church.
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:05.660]   Finally, when it got so bad, I had to confront her.
[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:09.380]   I said, "Hillary, at least for show,
[02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:12.180]   "at least for public show, if we get caught,
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:13.620]   "you're gonna have to stand up.
[02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:15.740]   "I know you go to Methodist church,
[02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:17.820]   "stand up and say you believe in God."
[02:13:17.820 --> 02:13:19.900]   She turned away from me, Alex.
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:20.740]   Never will forget it.
[02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:22.140]   She turned away from me.
[02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:24.660]   And as she started to step away from me,
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:26.580]   she kind of tilted her head back and said,
[02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:28.140]   "You know I can't do that."
[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:33.060]   That's haunted me all the years.
[02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:34.260]   You know, what did she mean?
[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:36.380]   You know I can't do that.
[02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:38.980]   I mean, if she made a deal with the devil,
[02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:40.700]   if there's ever been a person
[02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:42.620]   that has made a deal with the devil,
[02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:45.700]   I cannot imagine that they would act any different
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:48.020]   than Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:49.060]   She's evil.
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:50.100]   She's mean.
[02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:51.500]   Bill's a good timer.
[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:53.500]   He just wants the perks, buddy.
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:55.140]   That's all he wants.
[02:13:55.140 --> 02:14:00.140]   Hillary is pure, deep, evil, mean.
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:03.660]   Meaner than anything you've ever come in contact with.
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:07.060]   There's not a wild animal in Africa
[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:08.260]   that will attack you-
[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:10.820]   - Well, let me just say, at a spiritual level,
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:13.860]   at this level, fighting her and picking up on this stuff,
[02:14:13.860 --> 02:14:15.500]   it's nauseating.
[02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:17.020]   I can't look at her.
[02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:17.900]   I'm really sick of her.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:19.780]   I mean, she's a damn demon.
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:21.140]   And it seemed to really get to them
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:22.460]   that I called them demons.
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:24.300]   - Well, it would.
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:25.820]   She's sensitive to that.
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:26.740]   But I'll tell you this,
[02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:30.140]   ask anybody that's ever been around her about the odor.
[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:31.420]   - Let's talk about the odor
[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:33.340]   because I've had Secret Service say
[02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:35.740]   she smells like, basically like rotting meat.
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:36.780]   I said, "What's it smell like?"
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:38.540]   And a guy joked and goes, "You know, crap."
[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:39.380]   They go, "No."
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:41.260]   He said the other word, "SH, you know what?"
[02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:43.260]   And they go, "No, no, like rotting meat."
[02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:44.300]   We're all like, "Ugh."
[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:46.020]   Then I talked to Dolly Kyle.
[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:49.380]   She said, "Worst smell, dirtiest she's ever seen.
[02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:50.980]   Just totally filthy all the time.
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:52.140]   Had to be around her for years."
[02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:53.580]   And then I talked to their chef.
[02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:55.300]   He said, "Yeah, I never got really close,
[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:57.740]   but they say she stinks really bad."
[02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:00.940]   Obama, I've been told, smells like rotting meat.
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:03.260]   Now, the Bible says this is what demons smell like.
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:06.020]   I'm not, I just keep getting told they smell like hell.
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:07.980]   Tell us, Larry.
[02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:09.500]   - Look, you're talking to the guy.
[02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:13.740]   The first time I met her, she was all dirty, filthy,
[02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:16.940]   dirty hair, wearing a muumuu, flip-flops,
[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:18.260]   and she smelled horrible.
[02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:21.100]   Well, I thought it was because of her hygiene.
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:25.580]   Later, as she started getting cleaned up and dressed up,
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:28.820]   there is an odor around that woman
[02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:32.580]   that if you're within 10 rows of her,
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:35.540]   if you have any kind of smell sense at all,
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:37.380]   you're gonna smell her.
[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:39.660]   And it is, it's hard to describe that.
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:45.340]   Rotting meat, you know, just rotten.
[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:46.660]   It's just a rotten smell.
[02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:48.500]   - Well, I know the Secret Service people,
[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:50.060]   I mean, look scared.
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:51.740]   They said, "Listen, she's scary."
[02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:52.900]   I know they're all making jokes about it,
[02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:53.860]   but everybody that works around her,
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:55.780]   it's in the WikiLeaks, knows that this woman
[02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:57.380]   is like Linda Blair.
[02:15:57.380 --> 02:16:00.140]   - Hey, let me tell you, that is Sage Guy at WikiLeaks.
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:01.980]   Let's get one thing out in the open.
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:06.980]   The Ecuadorian government did not knock him off the internet.
[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:08.460]   They could unplug his computer,
[02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:09.780]   but they couldn't knock him off.
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:12.060]   You're seeing the first example
[02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:14.980]   of the UN having control of domain.
[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:16.540]   That's what knocked him off.
[02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:18.100]   And I'm gonna tell you,
[02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:21.380]   if that Ecuadorian consulate kicks him out,
[02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:23.860]   which the Clintons are gonna force him to do,
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:27.100]   you put this down in your book of Nichols quotes,
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:29.820]   Assange is dead in a week.
[02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:31.460]   Dead in a week.
[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:36.900]   Now, you can't get any tougher than that.
[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:38.900]   You do not cross the Clintons.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:41.020]   Not like that, you don't, and walk away.
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:41.860]   - Well, let me ask you this.
[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:44.260]   I know they've tried to take you out and other people.
[02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:45.100]   What do you expect?
[02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:46.940]   'Cause I mean, I understand,
[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:50.660]   but what do you expect to happen to yours truly?
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:52.380]   That she calls me the dark heart.
[02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:57.860]   - Alex, if she wins, and we don't do after,
[02:16:57.860 --> 02:17:01.580]   if she wins, the only option for us
[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:05.020]   is not to drain the swamp with term limits.
[02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:06.420]   The option is states' rights.
[02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:07.620]   I'm not gonna get into that now.
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:08.460]   - No, I agree.
[02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:09.300]   We have to go next level.
[02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:10.180]   And you know the good news?
[02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:12.700]   People now get it, and folks are going to the next level.
[02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:13.820]   They think they got power.
[02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:14.660]   They think they're evil.
[02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:15.480]   They wanna brag.
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:16.460]   Others are stealing elections.
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:19.220]   They're forcing a lot of people that were on the fence now,
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:21.500]   who are very serious people to get ready.
[02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:23.300]   And they tried to remove all the top generals.
[02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:24.140]   That hasn't worked.
[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:27.220]   The military is beside itself, as you know, Larry.
[02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:28.460]   - Yep, yep.
[02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:30.340]   Well, and I'm gonna tell you this, guys.
[02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:34.620]   If they were ahead, like they are pretending to be,
[02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:37.580]   trust me, they wouldn't be acting the way they are.
[02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:39.260]   They wouldn't have this media blitz,
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:41.260]   'cause Alex, they know what I know.
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:43.380]   You keep pushing this thing with the media
[02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:45.500]   like they're doing it, you run into back,
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:47.140]   you know, you end up in blowback.
[02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:49.660]   You worry about people thinking you're piling on.
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:51.540]   You get the sympathy vote.
[02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:53.140]   They're not, they wouldn't do that.
[02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:55.020]   - They wouldn't be going totally nuclear
[02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:56.300]   if they weren't in crisis.
[02:17:56.300 --> 02:17:58.100]   - Well, no, that's why Trump keeps saying it's rigged.
[02:17:58.100 --> 02:17:59.660]   Look, he goes and gets real internal polls,
[02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:00.940]   and so do the Democrats.
[02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:02.820]   I mean, I was talking to a major polling company last night,
[02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:06.540]   and they said, "My God, it's 60-30, 10% undecided.
[02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:09.260]   "Trump is at 60 nationwide."
[02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:11.420]   - I think you're gonna see what may,
[02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:14.460]   I'm hoping we see what happened in Europe,
[02:18:14.460 --> 02:18:16.620]   you know, with the Euro thing.
[02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:17.740]   Yeah, I think--
[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:18.660]   - Well, notice, notice, notice,
[02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:21.580]   Gingrich said that Trump's really 15 ahead on Sunday,
[02:18:21.580 --> 02:18:24.380]   because he kinda let go what's internal.
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:25.740]   - Well, trust me.
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:27.620]   They would not be acting the way,
[02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:29.140]   and y'all folks listening,
[02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:30.780]   you're getting it from a guy that was with 'em
[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:33.020]   and designed most of their dirty tricks.
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:36.300]   They would not be doing what they're doing now
[02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:39.420]   with such vigor if they were ahead.
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:40.980]   They wouldn't be.
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:42.260]   They would not be.
[02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:45.380]   And when they talk about tonight being the big deal,
[02:18:45.380 --> 02:18:47.860]   all I got to say, Alex, in closing,
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:50.380]   is tonight is Trump's night.
[02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:53.100]   - He's gotta come out like a focused laser beam
[02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:55.420]   and just chop her to pieces.
[02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:58.140]   - Just tell the truth and look in the camera
[02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:01.020]   and don't pay attention to anything going on.
[02:19:01.020 --> 02:19:03.860]   You tell the truth, tell about her,
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:05.740]   you know, stay away from the girly stuff,
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:07.900]   'cause they're gonna ask him that to get him distracted.
[02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:11.180]   He needs not to ever answer a question tonight
[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:13.820]   about these claims by these women.
[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:15.820]   He shouldn't answer a question at all, Alex.
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:17.580]   He needs to make a list of the things
[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:22.300]   he wants to tell 50 to 60 Americans and tell it tonight.
[02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:23.900]   - All right, Larry Nichols, thank you so much.
[02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:25.180]   Well, we sure had a nerve talking about
[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:27.340]   how they reportedly stink.
[02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:28.820]   They say even worse with Hillary.
[02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:30.260]   And I always thought it was like psychopaths
[02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:31.460]   and people like Mal didn't care,
[02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:33.100]   so they stunk just to be aggressive.
[02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:34.740]   But I think there's something more to it
[02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:36.380]   and the fly's all landing on them.
[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:37.220]   Larry?
[02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:41.700]   - Let me just tell you, there is something bad around them.
[02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:43.980]   And Alex, I wanna close with you asking me the question,
[02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:45.780]   what about yours truly, meaning you?
[02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:51.380]   If he wins, they're gonna use the fairness doctrine
[02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:52.780]   and take people off the radio.
[02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:53.860]   - Hold on, we gotta skip the break,
[02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:54.940]   'cause we're talking about fairness doctrine.
[02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:56.740]   I mean, I'm not a mere, so this won't matter.
[02:19:56.740 --> 02:19:59.580]   They admit, they say they've got a tie vote
[02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:01.140]   in the Federal Elections Commission,
[02:20:01.140 --> 02:20:03.500]   a tied vote in the Supreme Court,
[02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:08.420]   a tied vote in the FCC, all groups on the Democrat side
[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:10.700]   say they're gonna ban talk radio and internet news.
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:14.100]   Hillary said the alt-right has, quote, no right to exist.
[02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:16.860]   I mean, they've told us, 'cause they gotta come out
[02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:19.140]   in the open when they finally come for our First Amendment.
[02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:21.420]   And all the little leftists now think it's fun
[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:24.220]   to ban words and ban speech.
[02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:25.740]   And then these idiot leftists don't know
[02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:27.100]   the prosperity's all gonna end
[02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:28.720]   as soon as they bring the Republic down.
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:31.220]   They are such fools living in the bosom
[02:20:31.220 --> 02:20:34.060]   of what's left of this Republic, pissing on it all day,
[02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:36.420]   not having any idea they're about to lose everything, Larry.
[02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:38.420]   So you're getting into what's gonna happen.
[02:20:38.420 --> 02:20:40.460]   - Well, what's gonna happen, I'm telling you,
[02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:42.860]   it was a cool move when they moved that internet
[02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:44.780]   over to the UN, because you see,
[02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:47.100]   the UN doesn't have to honor our Constitution.
[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:48.260]   - And they're saying they're gonna follow
[02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:49.740]   the new political correct stuff
[02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:53.820]   that WikiLeaks shows Soros is running through Facebook.
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:57.100]   They admit they're quote, gonna shut down the alt media
[02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:58.700]   and only quote, promote our media.
[02:20:58.700 --> 02:21:00.420]   That little bastard, and it's not,
[02:21:00.420 --> 02:21:01.300]   bastards aren't bad people,
[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:02.540]   I shouldn't call Soros a bastard.
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:06.140]   That little murdering demon Nazi collaborator weirdo
[02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:08.940]   openly says in the WikiLeaks he's gonna shut us up.
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:12.960]   - You remember, first time I ever heard George Soros speak,
[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:18.540]   he said he would take his entire wealth
[02:21:18.540 --> 02:21:21.700]   and devote every penny of it to destroying America.
[02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:24.780]   And by God, he's got a tool now with the Clintons.
[02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:26.300]   They got the tool they need.
[02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:28.580]   - Why did he try to overthrow England, he admits it.
[02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:30.220]   Why does he try to overthrow everything
[02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:31.220]   Western and prosperous?
[02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:32.500]   What is his problem?
[02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:34.380]   - Because he believes in a global power.
[02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:36.980]   He believes that if you get the government
[02:21:36.980 --> 02:21:38.460]   the way Bill Clinton used to tell me,
[02:21:38.460 --> 02:21:40.020]   remember the perfect kind of government
[02:21:40.020 --> 02:21:42.860]   is you've got the number of ultra, ultra rich people.
[02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:45.300]   You can count on one hand, five fingers,
[02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:47.460]   and everybody else is dirt poor.
[02:21:47.460 --> 02:21:51.220]   Whoever controls that group controls the world.
[02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:52.740]   - And by the way, you've been saying that
[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:54.140]   on my show for 20 years.
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:57.060]   In the new WikiLeaks, I think it was WikiLeaks nine,
[02:21:57.060 --> 02:21:59.260]   or yeah, it was WikiLeaks 10,
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:01.660]   there's document after document in there saying
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:04.380]   we wanna keep them dumb, distracted, poor.
[02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:07.180]   I mean, it's so mean, it's so evil.
[02:22:07.180 --> 02:22:10.500]   - Well, and the problem is they've got a massive number
[02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:14.300]   of people that seem to buy into their stuff.
[02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:16.740]   - Yeah, where are all these weird trendy leftists
[02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:18.780]   that they're making top lieutenants
[02:22:18.780 --> 02:22:21.500]   who like prance around in little trendy outfits
[02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:24.300]   talking about stealing elections and killing people
[02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:25.700]   and murder and power,
[02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:28.060]   and they've never even killed anybody, Larry.
[02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:29.740]   - No, but think about this.
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:32.140]   If you or I made those kind of claims,
[02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:34.020]   we would be in jail today.
[02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:35.020]   We'd be in jail.
[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:37.140]   There's no action being brought about 'em.
[02:22:37.140 --> 02:22:40.620]   Remember when I told you, you asked me 100 times, Alex,
[02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:43.940]   at least 100 times, will Hillary be indicted?
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:46.620]   And you justified it, and you told me Comey was--
[02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:48.860]   - You said never, never, never, never.
[02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:50.700]   - And by God, they didn't, did they?
[02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:53.060]   They didn't.
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:55.180]   - Yeah, people, Larry, all I can say is everything
[02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:56.420]   you've ever said's turned out to be true.
[02:22:56.420 --> 02:22:59.140]   It's sickeningly accurate, except you said they were gonna,
[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:01.300]   and I called around and said, yeah,
[02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:02.940]   they're trying to order the FBI and others
[02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:04.460]   to cook up something on you,
[02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:05.860]   and then I guess there was some revolt,
[02:23:05.860 --> 02:23:07.820]   'cause it didn't happen, but you said they were gonna
[02:23:07.820 --> 02:23:10.660]   reportedly raid us and make something up last year.
[02:23:10.660 --> 02:23:12.380]   - They were trying.
[02:23:12.380 --> 02:23:14.500]   They were trying, but you've gotta remember,
[02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:17.300]   at certain levels, they've got people back then
[02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:18.740]   that wouldn't honor it.
[02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:21.380]   They don't have that problem today, Alex.
[02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:24.020]   There's nobody in the FBI that's gonna go against them.
[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:25.140]   You know that.
[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:28.220]   When she gets the power of the presidency, buddy,
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:33.740]   you'd be a fool if you weren't for the FBI, CIA, NSA.
[02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:37.980]   You'd be a fool if you crossed 'em.
[02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:41.100]   It won't just be the end of your career, as you know.
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:44.100]   It'll be far worse than that.
[02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:45.220]   And look at Donald Trump.
[02:23:45.220 --> 02:23:49.180]   If Donald Trump loses his world that he could've lived out
[02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:52.780]   the rest of his life in luxury and fame,
[02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:54.860]   you're not seeing they've destroyed his character.
[02:23:54.860 --> 02:23:56.780]   They've destroyed him.
[02:23:56.780 --> 02:23:58.900]   Donald Trump will never be the same if he loses.
[02:23:58.900 --> 02:24:01.020]   - And you know what's sad is he won't even,
[02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:02.660]   he may tell it later, but he was approached
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:05.100]   by good people in the military after Benghazi,
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:08.980]   and he went to Scotland, where his mom's from,
[02:24:08.980 --> 02:24:11.780]   spent over a month and a half, I think two months,
[02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:13.620]   and actually cogitated on it,
[02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:16.100]   and I was told before it ever came out in political,
[02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:19.100]   parts of it came out, and he called him back,
[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:20.580]   and he came back to New York, and he met with the people.
[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:22.460]   He said, "I can't do it."
[02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:24.980]   He goes, "I just, I don't know if the public
[02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:26.420]   "understands all this, or knew this and that.
[02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:28.060]   "I got a great life."
[02:24:28.060 --> 02:24:29.700]   And then he just realized, though,
[02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:32.620]   that he saw basically how people were getting poor,
[02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:35.100]   and how people on the street weren't doing well,
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:37.620]   and he hated seeing, and he said, "Okay, I'm gonna do it."
[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:41.940]   And he's totally, he's doing it to save, he's not perfect.
[02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:43.100]   He doesn't wanna hurt us, though.
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:47.860]   He's not a damn demon, and he's totally in the arena, Larry.
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:51.060]   - Well, Trump says the magic words to me.
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:53.780]   He's trying to pay back America
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:56.620]   for what it's given him the opportunity to do,
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:00.300]   and I feel sorry for him and his family,
[02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:03.140]   because every building they've got under construction
[02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:04.740]   in the United States of America,
[02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:06.900]   and eventually in the world,
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:09.220]   is gonna run into every kind of problem
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:11.100]   the government can issue 'em.
[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:12.420]   They're gonna be stunned.
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:13.860]   - Well, I mean, look, the word is,
[02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:15.940]   the word is Trump's already lost billions.
[02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:17.980]   It's confirmed 500 million.
[02:25:17.980 --> 02:25:20.140]   They are already destroying him right now.
[02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:21.780]   But you notice, I've been told he's gone
[02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:24.260]   from being a little bit kid-like and worldly
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:27.340]   to so solid now, it's actually made him stronger.
[02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:29.500]   And notice how hardcore he's getting.
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:34.060]   - Well, I think Donald Trump has finally found his faith,
[02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:36.660]   and that'll get him through a tough time.
[02:25:36.660 --> 02:25:38.620]   But let's not think he's lost yet,
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:40.580]   because I'm telling you all,
[02:25:40.580 --> 02:25:43.740]   and you're taking it from a technical like me,
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:45.620]   they're not behind.
[02:25:45.620 --> 02:25:47.140]   Now, will he win?
[02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:49.260]   I don't know, there's a whole lot of dynamics.
[02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:51.980]   Next time we talk, we'll talk about electoral college.
[02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:53.300]   I mean, there's all kinds of tricks.
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:54.140]   - Hey, they're setting it up
[02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:55.460]   to say the Russians are gonna hit it,
[02:25:55.460 --> 02:25:56.860]   and then they hit us with a cyber attack
[02:25:56.860 --> 02:25:58.300]   and blame the Russians.
[02:25:58.300 --> 02:26:01.060]   - Yeah, I mean, remember this, Alex.
[02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:03.500]   When you hear Hillary claim Trump's working
[02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:05.700]   with the Russians, there's one rule
[02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:07.500]   that never will let you down.
[02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:09.900]   - Whatever she accuses you of, she's doing.
[02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:11.420]   You got it, you got it.
[02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:13.540]   As long as you know that, you're safe.
[02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:15.580]   And if they tell you it's up, it's down.
[02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:17.260]   If they tell you it's left, it's right.
[02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:19.220]   Whatever they tell you, it's the opposite.
[02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:20.220]   - What about these media types,
[02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:21.140]   and I'm gonna go to Gary Haven,
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:23.020]   waiting for his support of Prince Haiti,
[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:24.300]   just to get in more of the Clinton crimes
[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:25.300]   and incredible breaking news,
[02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:26.700]   and I hope people will get out to folks,
[02:26:26.700 --> 02:26:28.900]   and we appreciate him holding.
[02:26:28.900 --> 02:26:31.060]   I look at the people they've collected into the media,
[02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:33.660]   and there's been a few at CBS that left
[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:35.660]   and exposed the truth, but they really have put
[02:26:35.660 --> 02:26:38.420]   a collection of sycophantic trash
[02:26:38.420 --> 02:26:42.420]   into the mainstream media who gleefully compete
[02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:46.620]   to be deceptive and really do hate the average American.
[02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:48.020]   And you know, that comes out in the WikiLeaks.
[02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:50.100]   I mean, they really did find trash,
[02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:53.100]   and I didn't know there was this much trash in this country.
[02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:54.740]   - Oh, you bet, you bet.
[02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:58.060]   And especially in the elite, literate world.
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:26:59.780]   You know, they consider themselves
[02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:01.780]   so far above you and me, Alex.
[02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:04.420]   They're the smart people,
[02:27:04.420 --> 02:27:08.300]   but they're so stupid that they can't even look at history.
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:11.100]   They can't go back, even at recent history,
[02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:13.020]   and look at the Clintons and look at everybody
[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:13.860]   that's been used all the way. - Oh, there's no doubt
[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:16.100]   it might be a year, it might be 10,
[02:27:16.100 --> 02:27:17.500]   but the further they push it,
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:19.620]   I don't want this to happen, but it's gonna be bad.
[02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:21.580]   There are gonna be every lamp pole in this country
[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:22.860]   is gonna have them hanging from it.
[02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:24.380]   - You got it, you got it.
[02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:26.780]   Just remember, go back, read Mein Kampf,
[02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:29.420]   the book that I used when I was helping build,
[02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:32.580]   the book he gave me for my first Christmas present with him.
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:34.220]   He said, "Be my gerbil."
[02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:37.260]   Go back and read it, and you'll see the plan
[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:39.980]   that they're implementing today.
[02:27:39.980 --> 02:27:41.580]   And they have found scumbags,
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:43.300]   just like you're talking in the media,
[02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:44.780]   and they've cleared out the people
[02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:48.060]   that were semi-truthful, they're gone.
[02:27:48.060 --> 02:27:50.180]   And all of these people, just like you're saying,
[02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:54.860]   they're competing to get to be in favor with Hillary.
[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:58.020]   That might not be a dumb move, actually.
[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:00.620]   If she gets elected, they might want to be in favor
[02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:01.940]   for their own protection.
[02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:05.060]   But I'm saying, they're gonna be destroyed in the end.
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:06.260]   They're gonna be destroyed.
[02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:07.820]   - Yeah, Hillary's gonna stand before God.
[02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:09.060]   I'm not scared of her.
[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:10.260]   - Yep.
[02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:12.540]   Well, I'm scared of what she's doing to the country, but--
[02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:13.620]   - But she's doing it to children,
[02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:15.740]   is why we gotta stand against her.
[02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:18.020]   NicholsLive@AOL.com, the folks wanna help you out
[02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:21.220]   with your operation to try to expose election fraud
[02:28:21.220 --> 02:28:22.900]   you've been dead on, so people can make donations there
[02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:24.060]   to help Larry Nichols.
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:28.460]   Larry Nichols, 58 Kingston Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034.
[02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:30.460]   We'll talk to you again tomorrow, Larry, thank you.
[02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:31.740]   - Sounds great, buddy, see ya.
[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:33.020]   - Thank you, let's get on for at least 30 minutes
[02:28:33.020 --> 02:28:34.220]   and take some calls tomorrow.
[02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:36.140]   I appreciate him joining us via Skype,
[02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:38.260]   from Port-au-Prince, or maybe it's phone.
[02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:40.580]   And that, of course, is Gary Haven,
[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:43.660]   billionaire who's given much of his wealth to charity.
[02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:46.060]   Three, four aircraft every week flying into Haiti
[02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:47.700]   since the big earthquake hit.
[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:48.740]   We're on a break here in a moment.
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:50.340]   We have a powerful video we're gonna play as well.
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:51.940]   But, wow, what do you think,
[02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:53.380]   hearing all this news about the Clintons
[02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:56.540]   and admitting massive election fraud already taking place
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:00.300]   as their own national heads admit they're involved in crime,
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:02.140]   but say they're above the law, Gary.
[02:29:02.140 --> 02:29:05.500]   - You know, I'm an eyewitness down here
[02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:08.100]   to the Clinton criminality.
[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:12.300]   There's 1.4 million people that are desperate right now.
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:16.660]   No roofs on their homes, no crops, no food.
[02:29:16.660 --> 02:29:20.340]   There isn't a Clinton dollar to be seen in this country.
[02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:22.580]   And the amazing thing is the Clintons are out
[02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:26.140]   raising money right now for Haiti.
[02:29:28.540 --> 02:29:30.420]   Hillary is a psychopath.
[02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:33.380]   It's hard for us to understand how she operates.
[02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:35.580]   You know, when you say she smells bad
[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:39.580]   and I call her a monster and a thief,
[02:29:39.580 --> 02:29:41.740]   you know, that's a payoff for her.
[02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:48.780]   She's gleeful about the fact that she can get away with this.
[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:49.620]   - Stay there.
[02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:50.460]   We'll come right back to you, my friend.
[02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:51.300]   Stay right there.
[02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:53.340]   - The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:56.380]   Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:56.900 --> 02:30:00.060]   (electronic whirring)
[02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:04.540]   - There's an article up on our website on Infowars.com
[02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:06.100]   written by Clifford Cunningham
[02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:08.980]   that addresses one anonymous Navy official
[02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:11.340]   telling Alaskans prepare for war.
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:14.300]   This official suggests that Russia is preparing an invasion
[02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:15.980]   in response to US strikes.
[02:30:15.980 --> 02:30:18.900]   He's unnamed, but he's warned the residents of Alaska
[02:30:18.900 --> 02:30:21.140]   to prepare for an invasion in the event of war
[02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:22.700]   between the US and Russia.
[02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:23.780]   This is what he said.
[02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:26.340]   We're on the verge of being invaded from Alaska
[02:30:26.340 --> 02:30:27.820]   all the way down into Canada
[02:30:27.820 --> 02:30:29.420]   and eventually to the Northwest.
[02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:32.300]   He said the invasion will begin via submarine
[02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:33.740]   near the city of Wasilla,
[02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:36.780]   approximately 43 miles northeast of Anchorage.
[02:30:36.780 --> 02:30:40.020]   Wasilla is located along the coast of Nick Arm,
[02:30:40.020 --> 02:30:42.740]   a body of water that branches into the Cook Inlet,
[02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:45.060]   which flows west into the Gulf of Alaska.
[02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:45.900]   He goes on to say,
[02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:49.140]   "Our feeling in the Navy was that Obama has turned Alaska
[02:30:49.140 --> 02:30:50.740]   into a defenseless area
[02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:53.180]   that will serve as a forward base of operations
[02:30:53.180 --> 02:30:54.820]   when World War III begins."
[02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:58.140]   I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.

[02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:36.260]   with its unique delivery system

[02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:03.360]   (upbeat music)
[02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:16.100]   - You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[02:33:16.100 --> 02:33:17.980]   It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.980 --> 02:33:22.100]   - I know the listeners know this,
[02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:26.140]   but I'm speaking to the White House minions
[02:33:26.140 --> 02:33:29.060]   and the Media Matters folks and MSNBC and everybody.
[02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:31.220]   I mean, I've studied history.
[02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:32.700]   I'm studying what the Clintons have done.
[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:35.080]   I've got their emails confirming it.
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:37.460]   I've talked to all people involved,
[02:33:37.460 --> 02:33:38.660]   people that don't even know each other,
[02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:41.100]   say the Clintons are super racist.
[02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:43.260]   They steal everything, not nail down.
[02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:44.200]   They don't give tips.
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:48.980]   They steal 94% of the money from Haiti.
[02:33:48.980 --> 02:33:50.540]   They're out collecting it again
[02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:53.180]   and the media won't even do anything.
[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:56.020]   I mean, it's been in the news that they steal the money,
[02:33:56.020 --> 02:33:57.780]   but it's like, it's all right,
[02:33:57.780 --> 02:33:58.700]   'cause they're the Clintons.
[02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:01.420]   It's just like a demonic protection.
[02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:03.300]   And I keep going back to this because,
[02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:06.020]   I'm gonna be honest,
[02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:09.540]   I'm not a person that gets scared of these people,
[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.140]   but I'm more freaked out
[02:34:11.140 --> 02:34:14.060]   because I've seen hours of footage.
[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:16.760]   We're gonna play some of it coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:18.160]   For radio listeners, I'll kind of narrate it.
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:19.800]   We're gonna post the video later this afternoon,
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:21.060]   infowars.com.
[02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:25.500]   With the UN standing down with our taxpayer money,
[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:27.200]   they're just there to control the situation, I guess,
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:29.000]   and be on the news so they can claim
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.120]   they're taking care of people,
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:32.400]   not medevacking people to the local city.
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:40.620]   The Clintons stealing all the money, collecting more money,
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:43.440]   and the crimes go on and on and on.
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:45.980]   And then these weird, spoiled, rotten kids
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:47.080]   are the baby boomers.
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:51.460]   And I mean, I'm a Generation X, Millennial,
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:52.300]   whatever you wanna call it,
[02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:53.900]   but Generation X people and Millennials
[02:34:53.900 --> 02:34:56.180]   are like these weird, I'm not saying all of us,
[02:34:56.180 --> 02:35:00.380]   but on average, weird, soft, disconnected people
[02:35:00.380 --> 02:35:02.620]   that as long as they tie into the power structure,
[02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:03.880]   they feel like they're winning,
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:05.640]   they don't care how evil it is.
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:08.420]   Just shut up, you're God, Trump's gonna lose.
[02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:10.780]   And I'm like, what about Haiti?
[02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:12.420]   Okay, let's just say Trump doesn't win.
[02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:14.800]   Haiti is really wrong, oh, just shut up, bigot.
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:18.440]   And they drive in the fast lane slow
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:20.780]   and make you get behind them and laugh at you.
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:22.620]   I mean, I'm beginning to study the psychology,
[02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:24.260]   they're like gremlins or something.
[02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:26.540]   They pull into gas stations and block both rows
[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:29.980]   and smile at you, and like the professor types,
[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:31.740]   they're leaders that are baby boomers do it.
[02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:33.420]   I'm starting to take photos of them and even interview them.
[02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:34.580]   I'm gonna put a film together
[02:35:34.580 --> 02:35:35.940]   where I'm gonna go confront them and say,
[02:35:35.940 --> 02:35:36.860]   oh, I see you're a Democrat,
[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:37.940]   I see you driving the fast lane,
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:39.340]   I see you block traffic.
[02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:41.500]   Showing the studies where they're six times more likely
[02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:43.820]   not to give to charity and to steal.
[02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:44.860]   That's in major studies.
[02:35:44.860 --> 02:35:47.740]   I mean, what they are is criminals
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:52.020]   who hate everyone and aren't successful.
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:53.980]   So they create systems to take over
[02:35:53.980 --> 02:35:57.620]   and then make us the successful, their slaves.
[02:35:57.620 --> 02:36:01.260]   And it's spiritual.
[02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:03.200]   I mean, I know Gary's a strong Christian
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:04.580]   and I'm not somebody that goes to church
[02:36:04.580 --> 02:36:05.540]   or thumps the Bible or anything,
[02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:07.260]   but the more you study this, it's spiritual.
[02:36:07.260 --> 02:36:08.580]   Now, Gary, I've been ranting and you're waiting
[02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:10.660]   to talk about this and draw attention to it.
[02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:11.500]   We're gonna have you back up next week
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:12.780]   to talk about charities out there
[02:36:12.780 --> 02:36:14.580]   that actually do deliver food to folks.
[02:36:14.580 --> 02:36:16.020]   I know you don't collect money to go to the charity,
[02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:16.860]   you just give your own money.
[02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:21.860]   But again, it makes me feel cold almost
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:24.900]   just to even get near the Clintons and study them
[02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:26.860]   because they're such demons.
[02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:29.220]   So when I say demons, it's the only way to describe them.
[02:36:29.220 --> 02:36:31.260]   They go out of their way to hurt people
[02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:33.380]   and then they have a whole system, a cult,
[02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:38.060]   that props them up and worships them and tends them
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:41.340]   and lies for them.
[02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:44.780]   So Gary, you were getting into the fact that,
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:47.420]   as we went to break, that here they are again,
[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:49.220]   you can Google it, they're in the news collecting money
[02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:51.900]   for Haiti from the hurricane, even though they've been caught
[02:36:51.900 --> 02:36:53.820]   and Chelsea's emails are like, mom and dad,
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:55.660]   you're killing people, you're not giving any money,
[02:36:55.660 --> 02:36:56.900]   why do we collect money?
[02:36:56.900 --> 02:36:59.540]   I mean, Chelsea's got a soul, it looks like.
[02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:01.180]   Or maybe they're so evil, they told her,
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:02.420]   do that to cover your ass.
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:03.260]   I mean, who knows?
[02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:06.820]   But it's just like, is there any bottom to these people
[02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:08.900]   and is there any bottom to their supporters?
[02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:10.660]   Is there nothing she could do?
[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:12.820]   Because hell, she's gonna increase their unemployment,
[02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:15.180]   she's gonna hurt the public that worships her,
[02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:16.540]   you know, that minority of folks that do.
[02:37:16.540 --> 02:37:19.580]   I mean, is this the great delusion the Bible talks about?
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:23.100]   - That's a great question, Alex.
[02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:26.540]   You know, the Bible tells us that in the latter days
[02:37:26.540 --> 02:37:29.900]   that we would call evil good and good evil
[02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:32.300]   and that we would reject righteousness
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:35.140]   and that he would give us over to great delusion
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:39.060]   because there's no way that a thinking person can,
[02:37:39.060 --> 02:37:41.180]   for example, look at the Clinton Foundation
[02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:44.260]   that's stolen $2 billion from these little children,
[02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:45.940]   the poorest in the hemisphere.
[02:37:45.940 --> 02:37:50.020]   And yet they continue to have half of the country
[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:52.740]   thinking it's a good idea that this monster
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:54.620]   become the leader of the free world.
[02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:57.100]   The only way that can happen is under delusion.
[02:37:57.100 --> 02:37:59.300]   And so we're experiencing a great delusion
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:03.140]   and there's no other explanation for it.
[02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:08.060]   - I wanna go through what you're witnessing,
[02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:10.180]   the state of things and play this seven minute clip
[02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:11.020]   and come back to you.
[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:14.820]   But in your gut, I always go back to gut,
[02:38:14.820 --> 02:38:21.620]   but also intellectually, you're a smart guy.
[02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:22.660]   What do you think's coming?
[02:38:22.660 --> 02:38:23.500]   What are we facing?
[02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:27.220]   Because the energy level in the world, everybody feels it.
[02:38:27.220 --> 02:38:29.180]   This is a special election right now.
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:30.460]   What's happening worldwide is special.
[02:38:30.460 --> 02:38:32.460]   We're at a decision time.
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:36.660]   And I think in my gut, I know if we don't elect Trump,
[02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:38.420]   but beyond that, if we don't all start making
[02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:40.980]   the right decision to stand up and speak out,
[02:38:40.980 --> 02:38:42.660]   I believe we're gonna come under great judgment.
[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:45.300]   And I believe there's gonna be a total worldwide
[02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:46.860]   financial meltdown and probably a world war.
[02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:48.700]   And I think like the Bible says,
[02:38:48.700 --> 02:38:50.060]   I think a third or more of the population
[02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:51.020]   is gonna be killed.
[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:56.140]   - Yeah, we're clearly in a fight
[02:38:56.140 --> 02:38:58.220]   with globalism and nationalism,
[02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:02.500]   whether it's the Brexit or what's going on
[02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:04.460]   with Marine Le Pen in France.
[02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:07.460]   The globalists have come out.
[02:39:07.460 --> 02:39:11.740]   Hillary has announced she's the globalist candidate.
[02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:13.180]   Trump's the nationalist candidate.
[02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:15.180]   He wants to make America great again.
[02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:16.260]   And that's the great battle.
[02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:20.460]   And this globalism, the Bible predicts is going to happen.
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:22.300]   The Bible tells us that it's gonna be led
[02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:24.660]   by the Antichrist himself.
[02:39:24.660 --> 02:39:26.420]   You know, you're gonna have to take the mark of the beast
[02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:27.460]   to buy or sell.
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:31.140]   This was written 2000 years ago.
[02:39:31.140 --> 02:39:33.540]   And even the ability to require people
[02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:36.300]   to take a mark to buy or sell was even conceivable.
[02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:38.460]   - They're suddenly on every channel,
[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:42.340]   NBC, CBS, Fox, Dr. Oz, all saying,
[02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:44.820]   take a mark to buy and sell, make yourself,
[02:39:44.820 --> 02:39:45.940]   they're now saying it.
[02:39:45.940 --> 02:39:49.500]   - Yeah, they want a cashless society
[02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:50.340]   because it's gonna reduce the cost.
[02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:51.860]   - Oh, that came out in the WikiLeaks.
[02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:54.540]   Apple wants a total cashless society, sorry.
[02:39:55.540 --> 02:39:57.700]   - Yeah, I mean, it's, man,
[02:39:57.700 --> 02:40:00.300]   if people can't see what's going on right now,
[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:01.140]   well, they're deluded.
[02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:02.620]   - Can they even see the symbol?
[02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:04.020]   What is the symbol of Apple?
[02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:08.540]   - Yeah, yeah, Satan's Apple he gave to Eve.
[02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:10.380]   - You can't make this stuff up, man.
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:13.340]   - I know, it's crazy, isn't it?
[02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:14.700]   - At a certain point, I'm just kinda like,
[02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:17.260]   whatever, then everybody wants this, fine, you know?
[02:40:17.260 --> 02:40:20.580]   - Well, let me tell you about the evil that's going on here.
[02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:22.980]   You know, you've got 1.4 million people
[02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:25.340]   that have been hit by a horrible earthquake
[02:40:25.340 --> 02:40:29.300]   and they got no food, no water, no medical supplies.
[02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:30.860]   - And all the leftist scum doesn't care
[02:40:30.860 --> 02:40:33.100]   that their God stole all the damn money.
[02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:35.740]   - Yeah, Hillary is hated here.
[02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:38.620]   And the reason there's no coverage,
[02:40:38.620 --> 02:40:41.380]   there's no network media here,
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:42.940]   and I'm convinced it's because
[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:45.140]   they're providing Hillary cover again.
[02:40:45.140 --> 02:40:47.460]   It's not enough that she sold $2 billion
[02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:50.300]   from the poorest people on this hemisphere,
[02:40:50.300 --> 02:40:52.380]   but now the media is providing her cover
[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:54.260]   and the world doesn't understand
[02:40:54.260 --> 02:40:56.220]   the disaster that we have here.
[02:40:56.220 --> 02:40:58.340]   You know, you've been hearing me talk about,
[02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:01.060]   I'm the only one feeding thousands of people,
[02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:05.700]   and we're the only air evac for two of the primary areas
[02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:07.300]   that were severely damaged.
[02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:08.980]   We brought in a little boy today,
[02:41:08.980 --> 02:41:13.740]   and yesterday brought in a couple people
[02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:16.980]   that would have died if my plane was not available.
[02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:20.540]   And so, you know, who am I to be here
[02:41:20.540 --> 02:41:23.740]   feeding this many people, saving these lives,
[02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:25.140]   when the world is supposed to have
[02:41:25.140 --> 02:41:27.100]   some sort of a response to this thing?
[02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:31.900]   And the media is not here because they're covering Hillary.
[02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:34.500]   They're criminally complicit in the death of these people
[02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:37.020]   that I'm working with.
[02:41:37.020 --> 02:41:37.860]   - Think about that.
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:39.860]   You've got four planes, you're feeding 4,000 people,
[02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:43.100]   you're the main medevac, there's shots of ospreys.
[02:41:43.100 --> 02:41:44.980]   As the troops leave, we have,
[02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:48.100]   they were there for two weeks, called out now.
[02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:49.940]   So at least the US military did show up,
[02:41:49.940 --> 02:41:51.380]   but Obama's pulled them out,
[02:41:51.380 --> 02:41:52.780]   and there's just nobody there.
[02:41:52.780 --> 02:41:54.860]   And it's just total devastation.
[02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:56.700]   Who's gonna help us when we get hurt?
[02:41:56.700 --> 02:41:58.980]   That's what I mean.
[02:41:58.980 --> 02:42:01.300]   The more liberal we say we are now,
[02:42:01.300 --> 02:42:03.540]   the more empty and evil it gets.
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:11.420]   - You know, Alex, my movie, "Amerigeddon,"
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:15.220]   depicts America being attacked by an EMP.
[02:42:15.220 --> 02:42:17.380]   And I think God sent me here
[02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:20.500]   so I could see what life was like for a million people
[02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:23.420]   without electricity, without water, without food.
[02:42:23.420 --> 02:42:28.180]   And I'm living it.
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:31.100]   And I tell you what, I wanna warn Americans.
[02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:34.260]   It ain't pretty when you don't have running water
[02:42:34.260 --> 02:42:37.380]   and you have no electricity, your food has been spoiled.
[02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:42.300]   And I really believe, this has given me that experience
[02:42:42.300 --> 02:42:44.340]   so that I can continue to get the word out
[02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:45.940]   that people need to prepare.
[02:42:45.940 --> 02:42:47.500]   And you need to understand that the government
[02:42:47.500 --> 02:42:49.540]   is not only not here to help them,
[02:42:49.540 --> 02:42:51.260]   but because our government is controlled
[02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:53.940]   by a shadow government, an elite,
[02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:57.140]   whom Hillary is part of, George Soros is part of.
[02:42:57.140 --> 02:43:01.060]   These evil bastards want absolute power.
[02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:05.180]   You know that Alton quote,
[02:43:05.180 --> 02:43:08.460]   "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
[02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:11.420]   There's a third sentence on it that nobody ever knows about,
[02:43:11.420 --> 02:43:14.340]   but it says that, "And powerful people
[02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:19.060]   "are mostly evil people."
[02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:21.620]   And it's time for America to wake up
[02:43:21.620 --> 02:43:24.660]   and understand that this kind of disaster,
[02:43:24.660 --> 02:43:26.300]   and by the way, I've been dealing with mobs
[02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:30.660]   of starving people charging me in my airplane.
[02:43:30.660 --> 02:43:34.140]   And that's what we're gonna have in America.
[02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:39.140]   If we allow these evil people to let North Korea
[02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:42.460]   do an EMP attack on our country,
[02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:45.740]   and that damn satellite flies over twice a day,
[02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:48.300]   and there's a very likely possibility
[02:43:48.300 --> 02:43:51.740]   that it has a miniaturized nuclear device on it
[02:43:51.740 --> 02:43:53.620]   designed for EMP.
[02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:54.460]   - Well, regardless, they can have
[02:43:54.460 --> 02:43:55.980]   one of these big Carrington events,
[02:43:55.980 --> 02:43:57.740]   so the sun, we could have another.
[02:43:57.740 --> 02:44:00.900]   The point is that, look at Fukushima.
[02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:01.940]   They don't care anymore.
[02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:04.260]   It's like they're demons that wanna hurt the planet.
[02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:05.700]   And I never used to talk like this,
[02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:09.340]   but more and more, they want power just to hurt people,
[02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:11.460]   and you read their WikiLeaks,
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:13.180]   they admit, "We wanna make people poor.
[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:14.100]   "We wanna dumb 'em down.
[02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:15.220]   "We wanna hurt 'em."
[02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:18.780]   I mean, they're just horrible.
[02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:20.180]   It's not just like they're greedy
[02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:22.260]   and make mistakes or whatever, they're bad.
[02:44:22.260 --> 02:44:25.140]   And that's why those of us that are not
[02:44:25.140 --> 02:44:27.820]   servants of the devil, I mean, the servants of pure evil,
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:32.020]   do not get these people are not on the same level we're on.
[02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:34.060]   They are on a completely different plane.
[02:44:34.060 --> 02:44:37.300]   - Yeah, you know, if you wanna defeat your enemy,
[02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:38.820]   you gotta know your enemy.
[02:44:38.820 --> 02:44:41.260]   And it's difficult for Christians,
[02:44:41.260 --> 02:44:43.380]   for people with our values,
[02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:46.380]   to get into the heads of these people.
[02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:48.980]   Remember, they want depopulation.
[02:44:48.980 --> 02:44:52.700]   They want a sustainable population, what they call it,
[02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:55.220]   which is about 500 million people.
[02:44:55.220 --> 02:44:58.940]   Our world population right now is seven billion.
[02:44:58.940 --> 02:45:03.940]   And so, you know, the picture of (audio cuts out)
[02:45:03.940 --> 02:45:08.780]   she's a useless eater, according to Hebrew Kessinger.
[02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:13.220]   So this is a way for them to eliminate a million people
[02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:16.580]   if they think they're not adding any value to society.
[02:45:16.580 --> 02:45:19.060]   Man, that's hard to get your head around,
[02:45:19.060 --> 02:45:20.900]   that they wanna kill.
[02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:22.380]   And they said it themselves,
[02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:26.660]   birth control is not gonna get it done.
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:28.900]   They need to have more aggressive measures.
[02:45:28.900 --> 02:45:30.900]   - Hold on, I'm gonna repeat that.
[02:45:30.900 --> 02:45:32.460]   Your Skype's breaking up, Gary Haven,
[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:35.540]   in Haiti, in Port-au-Prince right now via Skype.
[02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:37.220]   This little photo of this little girl
[02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:38.260]   in one of the towns you were in,
[02:45:38.260 --> 02:45:42.220]   this is from just driving by in the car from the HD video,
[02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:43.980]   a still that Zimmerman has.
[02:45:43.980 --> 02:45:45.940]   He's got the UN troops riding around
[02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:47.500]   doing nothing with their machine guns,
[02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:48.780]   basically looting people as well.
[02:45:48.780 --> 02:45:51.980]   But the point is, is that all this is happening,
[02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:53.500]   and that's one level.
[02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.620]   At the highest level, it's not even about,
[02:45:55.620 --> 02:45:58.060]   let's be mean and kill people 'cause we're overpopulated.
[02:45:58.060 --> 02:45:59.100]   That's their cover.
[02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:01.420]   The truth is they just like to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:04.300]   We know this from the British Royal Institute
[02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:08.020]   report on population, 1949.
[02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:09.500]   They said, "We can stabilize the third world,
[02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:12.220]   "industrialize them, not have them overproduce populations
[02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:14.980]   "that are unsustainable on unsustainable models
[02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:16.300]   "because you can always build a new model.
[02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:17.700]   "We're gonna have a big bloom
[02:46:17.700 --> 02:46:19.540]   "and then use that to destabilize the world,
[02:46:19.540 --> 02:46:22.380]   "use the cheap labor to leverage control of the West."
[02:46:22.380 --> 02:46:25.180]   And here we are 70 years later, brother, and they've done it.
[02:46:25.180 --> 02:46:26.300]   I mean, you gotta hand it to 'em.
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:29.540]   They've got a diabolical plan that is multi-generational,
[02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:32.780]   and it's inspired by something not of this world.
[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:34.260]   And mainstream media makes jokes about it
[02:46:34.260 --> 02:46:35.700]   and says I'm saying space aliens.
[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:37.340]   No, I'm not, I'm saying what the Bible says,
[02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:40.540]   an evil entity crash-landed on this planet.
[02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:41.700]   It's what the Bible says.
[02:46:41.700 --> 02:46:43.500]   And you look at it, it is evil.
[02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:46.100]   And how did God tell, you know,
[02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:47.820]   on the Isle of Patmos, John the Revelator,
[02:46:47.820 --> 02:46:50.740]   everything and tell Daniel and everybody else
[02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:53.140]   describing exactly what we now see,
[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:57.620]   giant metal insects coming in and fire as big as mountains
[02:46:57.620 --> 02:47:00.220]   and huge cities burning and the image of the beast
[02:47:00.220 --> 02:47:03.140]   seen in everyone's homes worldwide speaking to 'em.
[02:47:03.140 --> 02:47:05.660]   And it describes computers and everything
[02:47:05.660 --> 02:47:07.580]   and huge giant populations.
[02:47:07.580 --> 02:47:10.140]   And you know, the Bible said then it was a round planet
[02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:11.860]   and you know, and seven continents.
[02:47:11.860 --> 02:47:12.820]   I mean, it's all there.
[02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:14.240]   Before anybody had a satellite,
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:15.900]   anybody had been in a ship around the world,
[02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:17.140]   it's telling you what's happening.
[02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:19.620]   But as Christ said, it's not meant for the profane
[02:47:19.620 --> 02:47:20.960]   to be able to understand this.
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:22.740]   That's why they say, why do you speak in parables?
[02:47:22.740 --> 02:47:24.220]   Because it wasn't meant for the profane
[02:47:24.220 --> 02:47:25.320]   to even understand it.
[02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:29.820]   - Yeah, you know, even people that don't understand
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:34.180]   what the Bible is to you and me and to Christians,
[02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:37.100]   (audio cuts out)
[02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:39.020]   the parts you just talked about,
[02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:42.500]   from a logical perspective, you know,
[02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:45.020]   had it 2,000 years ago, they came up with the idea
[02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:47.020]   that there would be this economic system
[02:47:47.020 --> 02:47:49.660]   that would be controlled all over the world.
[02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:53.260]   You know, I invite them just to read it from reason
[02:47:53.260 --> 02:47:57.900]   and weigh out the evidence that was predicted at this time.
[02:47:57.900 --> 02:48:00.340]   And it goes a long way of explaining things.
[02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:03.300]   You know, if people realize that there's a spiritual
[02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:06.220]   dimension to this, and that spiritual dimension
[02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:11.220]   was forewarned 2,000 years ago, and it's very specific.
[02:48:11.220 --> 02:48:14.700]   And also the nature of people.
[02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:17.500]   You know, the Bible says the heart is exceedingly wicked.
[02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:20.540]   Let me tell you what, these people don't know Jesus.
[02:48:20.540 --> 02:48:23.620]   Many of them, like Hillary, are personally acquainted
[02:48:23.620 --> 02:48:25.780]   with Satan himself, I'm convinced of that.
[02:48:25.780 --> 02:48:28.820]   - Well, they admit it, they're into the occult.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:30.700]   Exactly, well, let's take it from a science fiction angle.
[02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:31.940]   No, I'm not saying I believe this,
[02:48:31.940 --> 02:48:33.940]   I'm saying it's an allegory.
[02:48:33.940 --> 02:48:36.540]   Okay, there's God, and then there's this evil thing
[02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:38.860]   that's below and wants to hurt God's creation,
[02:48:38.860 --> 02:48:39.900]   it's come here.
[02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:41.980]   God's not gonna just leave us in the hands of this thing
[02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:44.580]   that wants to seduce us through free will to destroy us.
[02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:46.860]   We're gonna get a warning about the technology
[02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:50.060]   that God knows this fallen creature that God made
[02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:51.260]   is gonna use on us.
[02:48:51.260 --> 02:48:53.660]   And so God said, hey, here's what they're gonna do,
[02:48:53.660 --> 02:48:56.620]   be ready, so that those of us that understand it get it,
[02:48:56.620 --> 02:48:59.420]   and then we have this big animating contest of liberty.
[02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:03.260]   - That's right, you know, the Bible says,
[02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:06.580]   be not ignorant of the enemy's devices.
[02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:08.340]   And I'll tell you what, you and I,
[02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:12.060]   a lot of people out there have been teaching Americans
[02:49:12.060 --> 02:49:15.540]   that were willing to listen what those devices are.
[02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:18.540]   And you know, God's, he always promised there'd be a remnant
[02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:20.540]   and he promises that he and us is greater
[02:49:20.540 --> 02:49:22.060]   than he is in the world.
[02:49:22.060 --> 02:49:24.180]   We've gotta exercise our power.
[02:49:24.180 --> 02:49:25.580]   You know, I've got a number of emails
[02:49:25.580 --> 02:49:28.460]   that I need to be afraid for my life
[02:49:28.460 --> 02:49:32.580]   because this is a great place for the Clinton crime family
[02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:34.140]   to put a hit on me.
[02:49:34.140 --> 02:49:39.140]   You know what, my name is determined by my God
[02:49:39.140 --> 02:49:43.700]   and even said for himself in collaboration with this.
[02:49:43.700 --> 02:49:44.980]   - Yeah, Gary, your Skype's gone,
[02:49:44.980 --> 02:49:47.060]   we can't pick you up again, hold on,
[02:49:47.060 --> 02:49:48.460]   we might have to reconnect.
[02:49:48.460 --> 02:49:51.980]   But absolutely, people don't think the way,
[02:49:51.980 --> 02:49:53.900]   I guess we do that are actually at this level.
[02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:55.340]   Everybody keeps saying the Clintons can get you,
[02:49:55.340 --> 02:49:56.460]   they kill people, don't you know?
[02:49:56.460 --> 02:49:58.700]   Yes, we know is the point, we're doing this
[02:49:58.700 --> 02:50:00.460]   because somebody's gotta stand up to them,
[02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:02.260]   somebody's gotta say no.
[02:50:02.260 --> 02:50:03.780]   And so it's kind of irritating people say,
[02:50:03.780 --> 02:50:05.220]   hey, you know, you better watch it.
[02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:06.340]   What you don't think I don't know
[02:50:06.340 --> 02:50:08.180]   that they got me fired from a job,
[02:50:08.180 --> 02:50:10.180]   they had a crew come and physically attack me.
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:11.300]   Gary, I think your Skype's back,
[02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:12.760]   you were just making that point that,
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:14.260]   of course you know you're in danger.
[02:50:14.260 --> 02:50:15.380]   I mean, Haiti's one of the most dangerous people
[02:50:15.380 --> 02:50:17.300]   in the world, you're landing on dirt airfields,
[02:50:17.300 --> 02:50:18.580]   looks like a James Bond movie.
[02:50:18.580 --> 02:50:20.240]   Of course you know what the hell you're doing.
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:21.500]   This is the real deal.
[02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:25.620]   You know, folks steal our thunder when they think we're,
[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:28.100]   when they think we don't know what we're doing, go ahead.
[02:50:28.100 --> 02:50:32.180]   - Yeah, I'll tell you how dangerous this is.
[02:50:32.180 --> 02:50:35.100]   Not, and I want to be clear, not me
[02:50:35.100 --> 02:50:37.180]   or my three aircraft that are here,
[02:50:37.180 --> 02:50:41.340]   but another volunteer crashed the night before last.
[02:50:41.340 --> 02:50:44.740]   And three people that were here on their own,
[02:50:44.740 --> 02:50:48.860]   their own money, volunteering, died in the sea.
[02:50:48.860 --> 02:50:50.300]   They flew through a thunderstorm.
[02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:52.580]   So this is serious stuff.
[02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:55.340]   And we're doing landings to get children out of here
[02:50:55.340 --> 02:50:56.180]   and get food.
[02:50:56.180 --> 02:50:57.000]   - No, this is serious.
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:58.220]   We're going to play some of the footage straight ahead.
[02:50:58.220 --> 02:50:59.820]   Stay there, Gary Haven.
[02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:01.580]   - Why be held hostage by your wireless carrier
[02:51:01.580 --> 02:51:02.420]   for two years?

[02:51:04.540 --> 02:51:06.220]   no hidden costs, tracking, tracing,
[02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:08.340]   harvesting customer data or draconian gimmicks?

[02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:35.340]   You've heard about bunkers, but surviving is not recreation.

[02:52:59.120 --> 02:53:01.820]   - Men, if you're like me, you appreciate the feeling
[02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:05.060]   of a clean, smooth shave from a quality blade.
[02:53:05.060 --> 02:53:08.820]   The sort of shave that cuts clean without the burn.
[02:53:08.820 --> 02:53:11.580]   So why are you messing around with generic razors
[02:53:11.580 --> 02:53:13.880]   that cost 32 bucks for an eight pack
[02:53:13.880 --> 02:53:16.020]   when you can shave with Harry's high quality
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:18.880]   German engineered blades for half the price?
[02:53:18.880 --> 02:53:20.780]   And because Harry's is so confident
[02:53:20.780 --> 02:53:22.460]   in the quality of their blades,
[02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:24.600]   they'll send you their most popular set

[02:54:05.620 --> 02:54:11.320]   Kicking off at 11 a.m. so we're now three hours into it.
[02:54:11.320 --> 02:54:12.740]   Right through to midnight.
[02:54:12.740 --> 02:54:16.800]   Infowars.com/show to find the free internal feeds we have.
[02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:19.520]   We also have YouTube feeds and others.
[02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:22.920]   We're gonna be dialing into the internal Trump feed
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:24.120]   that we have access to.
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:27.040]   The media always has a heyday with stuff like that.
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:28.080]   Look at Alex Jones and his crew.
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:31.360]   They have backstage total Supreme passes at the RNC.
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:32.480]   No!
[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:34.080]   The Republican Party hated it too.
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:36.680]   But the point is, is this is part of taking the country back
[02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:38.960]   and Trump has really broken through
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:40.140]   the electronic Berlin Wall.
[02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:43.040]   Even if they steal it from him, it's a huge victory.
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:44.920]   And the WikiLeaks, there's no way Hillary
[02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:46.740]   won't get impeached now.
[02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:48.540]   I mean, it's just a thousand crimes
[02:54:48.540 --> 02:54:50.480]   on top of a thousand outrages.
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:53.280]   We have them now and more is coming.
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:55.420]   So it's the battle's joined.
[02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:57.520]   Gary Haber will be with us about 15 minutes the next hour.
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:59.800]   I wanna play this special report on Haiti
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:01.240]   that I don't even know what to name it.
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:02.440]   I mean, I wanna put an article out.
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:03.720]   I wanna get attention to this.
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:04.840]   Not just to expose the Clintons,
[02:55:04.840 --> 02:55:08.000]   but to know that the American people gave billions
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.420]   of dollars, the Clintons stole most of it.
[02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:13.180]   They got people in the media that they control to say,
[02:55:13.180 --> 02:55:14.240]   give it to us.
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:15.080]   And then they kept it.
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:18.180]   It's just, it's unbelievable.
[02:55:18.180 --> 02:55:20.780]   Imagine if Putin started a charity and kept,
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:22.460]   you know, of $2 billion of it,
[02:55:22.460 --> 02:55:27.060]   kept 100 million, 900 and something, you know.
[02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:31.500]   I mean, it's just, it's 94% they kept.
[02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:33.340]   It makes my head spin.
[02:55:33.340 --> 02:55:35.580]   Speaking of funding for this platform
[02:55:35.580 --> 02:55:37.220]   to promote everybody else,
[02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:38.600]   we are selling a new shirt.
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:40.360]   In fact, here it is.
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:41.480]   And it's a one-time run.
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:43.060]   It says, Trump is my president.
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:45.680]   So you can have this in time for the election.
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:47.020]   Trump is my president.
[02:55:47.020 --> 02:55:48.460]   There's legalized freedom on the back,
[02:55:48.460 --> 02:55:50.260]   infowars.com, spread the word.
[02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:51.380]   It's in red.
[02:55:51.380 --> 02:55:52.580]   We have the Hillary for President shirt.
[02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:53.700]   It's limited edition, about to end.
[02:55:53.700 --> 02:55:56.500]   We have store-wide free shipping right now.
[02:55:56.500 --> 02:55:59.180]   And we also have a lot more, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:59.180 --> 02:56:02.340]   I've gotta come back to Gary Haber here in just a moment
[02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:04.460]   because I haven't plugged any sponsors today.
[02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:06.300]   I need to do this big time,
[02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:09.580]   take advantage of 25% off Brain Force.
[02:56:09.580 --> 02:56:10.780]   We've got a lot of other great products.

[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:15.600]   like the anti-parasite cleanse.

[02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:05.940]   Again, it's directed by Chuck Undersea

[02:58:17.900 --> 02:58:18.980]   And will this film save the world?
[02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:22.140]   No, but will America Eden do it?
[02:58:22.140 --> 02:58:22.980]   No, will this show?
[02:58:22.980 --> 02:58:25.100]   No, but all of us together doing the right thing,
[02:58:25.100 --> 02:58:25.940]   speaking out, will.
[02:58:25.940 --> 02:58:28.860]   Back to Gary Haven in 70 seconds as we kick off
[02:58:28.860 --> 02:58:32.580]   the fourth hour, we'll premiere the full special report
[02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:35.520]   on the devastation the Clintons have left in Haiti
[02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:37.880]   and what nightmare monsters they are straight ahead.
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:40.440]   Infowars.com/show for the debate tonight.
[02:58:40.440 --> 02:58:43.040]   It's ongoing live coverage from now straight through it.
[02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:46.080]   The final showdown, 19 days left.
[02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:53.240]   - You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in,
[02:58:53.240 --> 02:58:55.720]   one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about
[02:58:55.720 --> 02:58:58.200]   on the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability
[02:58:58.200 --> 02:59:02.160]   of the power grid, the potential for power grid chaos.
[02:59:02.160 --> 02:59:06.280]   EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather,
[02:59:06.280 --> 02:59:10.400]   hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:12.320]   My friends, chaos is already here
[02:59:12.320 --> 02:59:13.600]   and it's gonna get a lot worse.
[02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:16.600]   That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have
[02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:19.600]   a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:22.880]   Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system
[02:59:22.880 --> 02:59:25.400]   at my house, the Solutions from Science system.
[02:59:25.400 --> 02:59:27.960]   Simply put, this thing is amazing.
[02:59:27.960 --> 02:59:30.440]   Solutions from Science only makes the best equipment.
[02:59:30.440 --> 02:59:33.240]   Go to powergridchaos.com.
[02:59:33.240 --> 02:59:36.320]   That's powergridchaos.com to check it out.
[02:59:36.320 --> 02:59:37.400]   Now this is key.

[02:59:40.960 --> 02:59:43.000]   perfect power solar generator.
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:44.960]   This is the one I use in my home.

[02:59:49.700 --> 02:59:55.640]   - You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:55.640 --> 02:59:58.220]   (upbeat music)
[02:59:58.220 --> 03:00:18.240]   Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups.
[03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:19.960]   You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:21.560]   Well, so does he.
[03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:24.840]   Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[03:00:24.840 --> 03:00:26.240]   it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:33.480]   Gary Haber's looking for two more segments.
[03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:35.400]   And he's just trying to purely draw attention to this.
[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:38.720]   He put out his film, great costume, self-amerigeddon.
[03:00:38.720 --> 03:00:41.020]   Try to expose the UN globalist takeover.
[03:00:41.020 --> 03:00:43.480]   He's just done so much more.
[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:45.800]   He helped expose Ted Cruz at a critical point.
[03:00:45.800 --> 03:00:48.200]   He's joined us via phone because the sky has been degrading
[03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:50.580]   so bad in the hurricane hit area.
[03:00:50.580 --> 03:00:52.360]   This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:54.600]   We're gonna premiere the special report.
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:56.320]   What do you think we call this controversy?
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:00:58.640]   'Cause I'm trying, so much is headlines,
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:00.240]   so much is how to put this out.
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:03.860]   I mean, the Clintons, I think the Clintons are again,
[03:01:03.860 --> 03:01:04.700]   stealing the money.
[03:01:04.700 --> 03:01:06.080]   I think that's the new controversy.
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:08.440]   The Clintons are again stealing the money
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:09.780]   from the Haitians again,
[03:01:09.780 --> 03:01:11.780]   while the UN stands down medical care.
[03:01:11.780 --> 03:01:13.560]   I think that's really the headline.
[03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:16.240]   Make some points, we can cut this into the report today
[03:01:16.240 --> 03:01:18.240]   and then put it out on the nightly news.
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:23.080]   - As a CEO and a brand builder,
[03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:24.160]   I'm pretty good at this stuff.
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:27.520]   I think I would call it Haiti, the hidden disaster.
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:29.040]   And then the byline would be
[03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:36.000]   the cover by the Hillary media.
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:42.000]   - That's right, the Hillary media covers up Clinton crime.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:43.920]   - Yep, that's what this is about.
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:45.720]   You know, Alex, if there were,
[03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:48.820]   even Fox News, if they were to show up,
[03:01:48.820 --> 03:01:50.320]   I mean, none of them are here,
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:54.040]   they would tell Americans what's going on.
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:55.920]   And you know, as you mentioned,
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:02:00.120]   Americans, particularly the evangelicals,
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:01.800]   are the ones that respond to need.
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:03.440]   You know, we all have to be obedient
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:06.760]   to caring for the lesser among us.
[03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:11.560]   And this is an opportunity for Americans to respond.
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:14.080]   I gave you a name of a charity.
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:19.080]   It's called F-E-R-H-A, FARA.org.
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:20.280]   There it is.
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:21.960]   And people can donate to that.
[03:02:21.960 --> 03:02:23.480]   And that's a charity that I've been supporting
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:26.080]   for five and a half years since--
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:27.560]   - And it's based right there.
[03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:31.840]   - Yep, so people can do something
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:34.520]   by sending them some resources.
[03:02:34.520 --> 03:02:36.800]   You know, the UN has only secured $12 million
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:39.240]   for this disaster.
[03:02:39.240 --> 03:02:41.800]   There's 1.4 million affected.
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:45.000]   Alex, that's less than $10 a person.
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.160]   That's what the world is committed to this.
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:52.160]   - Well, again, what adds insult to injury
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:54.880]   is just that they use Haiti to suck money out of people
[03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:57.080]   and then don't even give them half of it.
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:02:59.800]   And then they prance around like they're angels.
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:00.840]   It makes me sick.
[03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:04.360]   - And you know, I gotta tell you,
[03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:06.880]   I ain't seen a Red Cross or a Blue Cross
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:10.040]   or any kind of, you know, it's all individuals.
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:12.000]   And there's a lot of great people
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.920]   that have stopped their lives and come here and help.
[03:03:14.920 --> 03:03:17.520]   Doctors, nurses, medical workers.
[03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:20.240]   And I'm really proud of these people.
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:22.440]   But I tell you what, it's hundreds.
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:24.960]   We need thousands.
[03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:28.600]   And there's no help coming from the media.
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:30.440]   - And by the way, that's a normal human instinct
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:32.800]   God gave us, to wanna go help people that are in trouble
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:33.960]   if we have the means.
[03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:36.320]   And it seems like they are driving that instinct out.
[03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:38.200]   I mean, they have studies that the more industrialized
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:40.200]   we get, people just watch a raped woman,
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:42.520]   you know, bleed to death for two hours in the street.
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:44.880]   And the CEO of a Toronto company told his employees,
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:47.040]   "Don't even call the cops, it's a diversion."
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:48.360]   And the woman died.
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:50.600]   I mean, this is getting weird.
[03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:52.520]   - Yeah, you know, a woman gets raped
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:56.240]   while people stand around and are afraid to do things.
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:03:58.760]   You know, I'm a Texan and you're a Texan.
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:01.360]   We're men in our state.
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:04.160]   We haven't been feminized.
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:07.640]   And we're not afraid to stand up to this evil.
[03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:09.440]   We're not afraid to stand up
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:11.560]   and defend these children and women.
[03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:13.120]   And I'm proud of that.
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:14.400]   And I think God's proud of all of us.
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:15.840]   - Well, I get so angry, I get so angry,
[03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:16.680]   I get tears in my eyes.
[03:04:16.680 --> 03:04:18.360]   Not 'cause I'm some goody two-shoe.
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:19.960]   I know that we're losing our soul.
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:22.120]   I'm gonna break, I'm gonna ask this when we come back.
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:26.760]   What do we do to put attention on this, Gary?
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:27.840]   'Cause I mean, there's more we can do,
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:29.160]   the Lister's can do.
[03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:30.520]   And then how do we shame the Clintons?
[03:04:30.520 --> 03:04:32.440]   I'm thinking about some new contest
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:35.480]   to shame them for stealing the Haiti money.
[03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:38.040]   That's it, bigger than exposing the rape.
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:39.640]   Should I offer another 100,000
[03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:41.960]   for people confronting them on national TV
[03:04:41.960 --> 03:04:43.680]   about stealing the Haitian money?
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:46.440]   I think-- - Good idea.
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:49.160]   - I think that's what we need to do, don't we?
[03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:50.480]   - Yep, let's talk about it in a minute.
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:52.040]   - We'll be right back with Gary Haven.
[03:04:52.040 --> 03:04:53.600]   He's down there and I had some other questions
[03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:55.360]   I wanted to ask as well.
[03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:58.760]   But I tell you, these people are just the scum of the earth.
[03:04:58.760 --> 03:05:03.520]   - Tonight, tune into Infowars.com/show
[03:05:03.520 --> 03:05:06.160]   for live coverage of the big, epic last debate
[03:05:06.160 --> 03:05:08.200]   between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:10.520]   We're starting our pre-debate show at 3 p.m. Central,
[03:05:10.520 --> 03:05:12.080]   right after the main transmission.
[03:05:12.080 --> 03:05:14.120]   So if you're already watching the Alex Jones Show,
[03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:15.320]   just continue watching.
[03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:17.440]   At 7 p.m. Central, we'll go over what to watch for
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:18.400]   during the debate.
[03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:20.600]   And the debate starts at 8 p.m. Central.
[03:05:20.600 --> 03:05:22.520]   Now this debate is not just about Donald Trump
[03:05:22.520 --> 03:05:23.400]   versus Hillary Clinton,
[03:05:23.400 --> 03:05:25.240]   but rather it's about how the shadow government
[03:05:25.240 --> 03:05:27.320]   is finally uncloaking before our very eyes
[03:05:27.320 --> 03:05:28.520]   to destroy U.S. sovereignty.
[03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:30.840]   The latest WikiLeaks emails reveal the inner workings
[03:05:30.840 --> 03:05:33.800]   of a global elite who are forging an authoritarian society
[03:05:33.800 --> 03:05:36.240]   dominated by technocrats in government, technology,
[03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:38.000]   and media, whose claim to power rests solely
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:39.960]   on their arrogant belief they are superior
[03:05:39.960 --> 03:05:41.120]   to the rest of society.
[03:05:41.120 --> 03:05:43.440]   These elites stay in control using military conflict,
[03:05:43.440 --> 03:05:44.640]   which begs the question,
[03:05:44.640 --> 03:05:47.240]   will they force the U.S. into a nuclear war with Russia?
[03:05:47.240 --> 03:05:49.360]   Will 2017 mark the beginnings of global tyranny
[03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:50.600]   or the Renaissance of liberty?
[03:05:50.600 --> 03:05:53.440]   Again, tune in to Infowars.com/show tonight
[03:05:53.440 --> 03:05:55.840]   for live debate coverage starting at 3 p.m. Central
[03:05:55.840 --> 03:05:57.520]   with the debate at 8 p.m. Central.
[03:05:57.520 --> 03:05:58.960]   This is Kit Daniels reporting.

[03:06:08.720 --> 03:06:11.560]   - Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:13.920]   The American system of justice must be changed
[03:06:13.920 --> 03:06:15.640]   to conform to the rest of the world.
[03:06:15.640 --> 03:06:18.560]   Individual rights will have to take a backseat

[03:06:27.080 --> 03:06:27.920]   It ain't gonna sit well.
[03:06:27.920 --> 03:06:30.440]   - Do you ever wonder what happened to America?

[03:06:59.560 --> 03:07:01.520]   - Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here,

[03:07:02.680 --> 03:07:04.400]   And as many of you know, I'm on a mission

[03:07:06.520 --> 03:07:08.560]   You've all heard the shocking statistics.

[03:07:10.540 --> 03:07:14.280]   nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country,
[03:07:14.280 --> 03:07:16.520]   obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease,
[03:07:16.520 --> 03:07:18.720]   and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:07:18.720 --> 03:07:20.440]   One out of three or four people is dealing

[03:07:21.640 --> 03:07:23.560]   and everyone knows at least one person
[03:07:23.560 --> 03:07:25.280]   with a degenerative disease.
[03:07:25.280 --> 03:07:26.840]   If you're dealing with a health challenge,

[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:42.200]   then go to break and bring Anthony Gucciardi in,
[03:08:42.200 --> 03:08:43.160]   balance out the sour.
[03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:45.320]   Then we got a big lineup today
[03:08:45.320 --> 03:08:47.320]   of exclusive guest reporters,
[03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:49.440]   live feeds before, during, and after.
[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:51.880]   We're gonna have feeds into the Trump area
[03:08:51.880 --> 03:08:54.400]   that nobody has but us and Right Side,
[03:08:54.400 --> 03:08:55.440]   directly from the Trump folks
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:08:57.720]   with a special press conference they're gonna do after.
[03:08:57.720 --> 03:08:59.960]   They've got surprises before.
[03:08:59.960 --> 03:09:03.160]   We'll mix all the feeds together at Infowars.com
[03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:04.520]   from here in Austin, Texas.
[03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:06.880]   And of course, you can tune into other feeds as well
[03:09:06.880 --> 03:09:07.800]   that we'll have on the site,
[03:09:07.800 --> 03:09:10.800]   but Infowars.com/show.
[03:09:10.800 --> 03:09:12.800]   You're part of this revolution against the mainstream media.
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:16.520]   Spread that link to everybody, Infowars.com/show
[03:09:16.520 --> 03:09:20.480]   for inside scoop at the debate for feeds and cameras
[03:09:20.480 --> 03:09:25.120]   and things MSM won't show you, Infowars.com/show.
[03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:28.880]   Gary Haven, we really should pull some stunts
[03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:32.120]   to expose Hillary and also then obviously
[03:09:32.120 --> 03:09:34.200]   get more aid to Haiti who was robbed.
[03:09:34.200 --> 03:09:36.160]   I wanna ask you a few questions though.
[03:09:36.160 --> 03:09:42.680]   Mainstream media says that it's two billion
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:45.120]   that Clintons took and that they took 94%
[03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:47.640]   and that they gave three to 5% depending on the year
[03:09:47.640 --> 03:09:49.880]   of their own money to charity.
[03:09:49.880 --> 03:09:52.120]   And then that itself was to them.
[03:09:52.120 --> 03:09:54.880]   So it's a total money laundering operation,
[03:09:54.880 --> 03:09:58.840]   but even the LA Times and others report that really
[03:09:58.840 --> 03:10:01.840]   what happened to the 3.9 billion that were supposed
[03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:04.080]   to go to Haiti that the Clinton Foundation got.
[03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:05.520]   So what's the real number?
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:07.920]   Is two billion conservative or what's happening?
[03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:11.960]   - Yeah, I used two billion because it's conservative.
[03:10:11.960 --> 03:10:14.000]   I think I could prove that,
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:16.000]   which is important for my credibility,
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:19.840]   but it's very likely north of that.
[03:10:19.840 --> 03:10:23.480]   And I would recommend people use the two billion
[03:10:23.480 --> 03:10:27.120]   plus number and talk about that.
[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:30.400]   You know, the head of the Haitian Senate
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:32.320]   did that press event with Trump the other day.
[03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:35.160]   By the way, I'm meeting this afternoon
[03:10:35.160 --> 03:10:38.520]   with the Haitian senator over that area.
[03:10:38.520 --> 03:10:42.320]   That's how significant our contribution
[03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:43.400]   has been to his area.
[03:10:43.400 --> 03:10:46.960]   We're there with our resources saving his people.
[03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:49.680]   And so he's getting behind us on this.
[03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:51.120]   You know, Alex, one of the problems here
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:54.680]   is the Haitian government has refused to declare an emergency
[03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:57.840]   because when they do, they give up sovereignty
[03:10:57.840 --> 03:10:59.640]   over the United Nations.
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:01.280]   They're not willing to do that.
[03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:04.080]   So the resources are limited.
[03:11:04.080 --> 03:11:06.200]   The Haitians are afraid of the power they'll lose
[03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:08.440]   and the vulnerability they have to the United Nations,
[03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:10.480]   which is a pretty good worry.
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:11.960]   - Yeah, how many times has Haiti been overthrown
[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:13.080]   by the West or the UN?
[03:11:13.080 --> 03:11:14.000]   Quite a few times.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:17.760]   - Yeah, you know, it's a mess.
[03:11:17.760 --> 03:11:20.400]   You know, the number one religion here is voodoo,
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:23.040]   which brings us back to the spiritual element.
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:28.760]   I was surrounded by 200 people yesterday
[03:11:28.760 --> 03:11:33.040]   out in this place where we're feeding 4,000.
[03:11:33.040 --> 03:11:35.800]   And, you know, the voices were loud, they were angry.
[03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:40.800]   And curiously, in a park beside me,
[03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:45.120]   they were playing voodoo drums
[03:11:46.040 --> 03:11:48.200]   while we were trying to get the crowd under control.
[03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:51.560]   My Haitian doctor who was with me was masterful.
[03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:54.360]   She got the crowd to calm down
[03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:58.160]   and she was able to explain that I was the one feeding them,
[03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:00.280]   told them my name, and then 200 people
[03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:02.040]   began to chant my name.
[03:12:02.040 --> 03:12:08.600]   The experiences here are just really hard to describe.
[03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:09.520]   - And even though it's hard,
[03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:11.200]   even though it's a hellhole in many respects,
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:12.840]   I would imagine, though, it feeds the soul
[03:12:12.840 --> 03:12:15.120]   to be doing good work and to be in the real world
[03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:18.080]   because, you know, a big pink pillow in the sky,
[03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:19.480]   New World Order, Matrix Land,
[03:12:19.480 --> 03:12:20.520]   is not the real world.
[03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:22.560]   It does not buoy the human spirit.
[03:12:22.560 --> 03:12:24.280]   But actually doing good work and trailblazing
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:25.720]   like you're doing, Gary, is.
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:27.960]   And I really appreciate you bringing the crew in there.
[03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:29.360]   I knew it was dangerous, but my God,
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:32.420]   watching the HD footage of you guys coming in on mud,
[03:12:32.420 --> 03:12:35.240]   grass runways by the edge of cliffs,
[03:12:35.240 --> 03:12:37.360]   and starving people and dying people
[03:12:37.360 --> 03:12:40.120]   and little starving children, and the haunting images.
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:43.200]   We've got more of the armored vehicles and the UN people
[03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:46.920]   and the little children, five, six-year-olds,
[03:12:46.920 --> 03:12:48.720]   their mothers and fathers are dead,
[03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:50.120]   wandering around in the rubble.
[03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:51.600]   I mean, this is unbelievable.
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:56.120]   - It's extraordinary, Alex, but I tell you,
[03:12:56.120 --> 03:12:58.480]   you know, I could be anywhere in the world
[03:12:58.480 --> 03:13:00.000]   doing anything I want to do.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:04.480]   I wouldn't trade any of it for this experience.
[03:13:04.480 --> 03:13:06.360]   I've been here 10 days now.
[03:13:06.360 --> 03:13:08.520]   I don't know when I'm gonna leave.
[03:13:08.520 --> 03:13:09.440]   I can't leave.
[03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:13.440]   People are depending on me for food and me only.
[03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:16.240]   You know, I always tell somebody, we're saving these lives.
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:18.400]   And it's not like a doctor doing a surgery
[03:13:18.400 --> 03:13:22.480]   and saving a life because there's other doctors.
[03:13:22.480 --> 03:13:26.440]   But here, doing this, there's me and my pilots
[03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:29.140]   and some great people that are teamed up.
[03:13:29.140 --> 03:13:31.320]   If not for us, there would be nobody.
[03:13:31.320 --> 03:13:36.320]   So these lives we're saving are even more incredible
[03:13:36.320 --> 03:13:38.960]   because they wouldn't be alive
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:40.480]   if we weren't here to be doing this.
[03:13:40.480 --> 03:13:42.760]   So I tell you, it's humbling,
[03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:44.440]   but it's the most satisfying thing
[03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:45.800]   I think I've ever done in my life,
[03:13:45.800 --> 03:13:48.800]   the joy of holding a little baby
[03:13:48.800 --> 03:13:50.280]   and putting them on the plane
[03:13:50.280 --> 03:13:51.480]   and knowing that we're gonna take them
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:53.040]   to a life-saving operation.
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:55.760]   Now, I tell you, it's a thrill.
[03:13:55.760 --> 03:14:01.880]   The negative is being an eyewitness to the corruption.
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:06.300]   And the Hillary Clinton program, the Clinton Foundation,
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:10.360]   we go back to what can our listeners do.
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:13.120]   They need to make this stuff go viral.
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:17.920]   Joe Biggs filmed, it looks like Hiroshima.
[03:14:17.920 --> 03:14:22.560]   And you're putting on stuff that can be sent viral.
[03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:24.420]   We need to get social media.
[03:14:24.420 --> 03:14:26.680]   And again, the hidden disaster
[03:14:26.680 --> 03:14:31.840]   in how the media is providing cover for Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:34.800]   And the media, because of Hillary's cover,
[03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:38.100]   is killing more people than the hurricane did.
[03:14:38.100 --> 03:14:41.400]   - Gary Haven, thank you so much.
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:43.120]   I'm gonna air this special report now.
[03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:44.160]   God bless you.
[03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:46.920]   And we'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:47.760]   - Great, Alex.
[03:14:47.760 --> 03:14:48.580]   Thanks for all you do, buddy.
[03:14:48.580 --> 03:14:49.420]   - Thank you.
[03:14:49.420 --> 03:14:53.040]   That's Gary Haven from Port-au-Prince there in Haiti.
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:56.600]   And we've got hours and hours of HD footage.
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:14:57.800]   I'm gonna air about seven, eight minutes
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:14:59.100]   of this footage right now.
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:03.200]   And then Anthony Guicciardi's gonna take over.
[03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:05.200]   Obviously, we're gonna skip this network break.
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:10.200]   But I sit back and I look at this world.
[03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:12.960]   And I sit back and I see what's unfolding
[03:15:12.960 --> 03:15:14.000]   and what's happening.
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:17.960]   And you really see what people are made of
[03:15:17.960 --> 03:15:23.080]   when things get down to brass tacks like this.
[03:15:23.080 --> 03:15:26.360]   That's exactly what the statistics show.
[03:15:26.360 --> 03:15:30.440]   So-called trendy modern liberals are not liberals.
[03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:34.440]   I don't wanna put that name of liberal on 'em
[03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:35.800]   'cause there are some real liberals out there
[03:15:35.800 --> 03:15:36.640]   that are pretty good people.
[03:15:36.640 --> 03:15:38.200]   I may disagree with them on a few issues,
[03:15:38.200 --> 03:15:39.880]   but they're good people.
[03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:42.720]   There's not many of those anymore, though.
[03:15:42.720 --> 03:15:46.120]   And they have really organized a group of criminals
[03:15:46.120 --> 03:15:49.080]   at every level of society to take over
[03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:53.260]   and force delusion on us and then just do horrible things,
[03:15:53.260 --> 03:15:56.360]   really despicable things.
[03:16:00.060 --> 03:16:02.600]   I mean, it takes Bill Clinton a lot of will and nerve
[03:16:02.600 --> 03:16:06.280]   to show up in Haiti for an hour off of a helicopter,
[03:16:06.280 --> 03:16:09.680]   shake a bunch of people's hands with Chelsea.
[03:16:09.680 --> 03:16:11.760]   Gotta put that article back up on screen.
[03:16:11.760 --> 03:16:12.720]   But Chelsea actually looks,
[03:16:12.720 --> 03:16:14.000]   I'm not trying to lionize Chelsea,
[03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.720]   but she actually looks concerned and upset.
[03:16:16.720 --> 03:16:18.120]   Bill's, "Oh, how you doing?"
[03:16:18.120 --> 03:16:20.960]   Shaking people's hands, leaves, steals billions of dollars,
[03:16:20.960 --> 03:16:23.040]   gives basically nothing back,
[03:16:23.040 --> 03:16:26.080]   and then feels like a good guy.
[03:16:26.080 --> 03:16:29.920]   I mean, I would not be able to get out of bed
[03:16:29.920 --> 03:16:32.480]   in the morning if I had stolen money from children.
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:35.580]   And again, Bill Clinton would call me weak.
[03:16:35.580 --> 03:16:36.940]   Hillary would call me weak.
[03:16:36.940 --> 03:16:41.500]   No, I'm alive, you people are dead inside.
[03:16:41.500 --> 03:16:46.440]   And I know they intimidate the FBI, different agencies,
[03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:47.740]   they hire a lot of crooks and stuff,
[03:16:47.740 --> 03:16:49.340]   so people are afraid to speak out,
[03:16:49.340 --> 03:16:51.000]   and if you do, you get killed, they come after you.
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:52.480]   They can't stop us all.
[03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:56.760]   And folks in media, it's the same thing.
[03:16:56.760 --> 03:16:58.740]   People get fired out of the media for telling the truth,
[03:16:58.740 --> 03:16:59.980]   like the CBS reporter did.
[03:16:59.980 --> 03:17:01.300]   She went and started her own media operations.
[03:17:01.300 --> 03:17:02.380]   She's more successful.
[03:17:02.380 --> 03:17:05.420]   Forget her name, don't have a teleprompter.
[03:17:05.420 --> 03:17:08.140]   You just gotta do the right thing,
[03:17:08.140 --> 03:17:09.900]   and just say, "Whatever happens, happens.
[03:17:09.900 --> 03:17:11.340]   "I'm doing the right thing."
[03:17:11.340 --> 03:17:13.540]   And then you build a good world,
[03:17:13.540 --> 03:17:15.820]   when almost everybody lies down
[03:17:15.820 --> 03:17:17.460]   and acts like a bunch of cowards.
[03:17:17.460 --> 03:17:24.960]   It really is a frightening prospect of the future,
[03:17:24.960 --> 03:17:27.340]   because evil takes over.
[03:17:27.340 --> 03:17:30.620]   You're not safe laying down to evil, you're in danger.
[03:17:30.620 --> 03:17:32.740]   And I see these controversy,
[03:17:32.740 --> 03:17:34.740]   people not wanting to stand up during the national anthem,
[03:17:34.740 --> 03:17:35.780]   and hey, I'm all into free speech.
[03:17:35.780 --> 03:17:37.460]   If you don't wanna do that, that's your issue.
[03:17:37.460 --> 03:17:39.620]   But then they go forward to bash America
[03:17:39.620 --> 03:17:42.460]   and say it's the worst, and bitch and gripe on top of it,
[03:17:42.460 --> 03:17:45.580]   and say how great George Soros is and Obama is,
[03:17:45.580 --> 03:17:47.500]   when they're big warmongering criminals
[03:17:47.500 --> 03:17:48.780]   launching all these wars.
[03:17:48.780 --> 03:17:53.540]   Now, the corporate media makes it popular to bash America.
[03:17:53.540 --> 03:17:55.740]   They either want empty, fake patriotism,
[03:17:55.740 --> 03:17:59.020]   or they want this big, fake, empty attack patriotism,
[03:17:59.020 --> 03:18:00.300]   but to support globalism.
[03:18:00.300 --> 03:18:04.060]   And quite frankly, when I was a teenager,
[03:18:04.060 --> 03:18:05.620]   I was studying fascism and things,
[03:18:05.620 --> 03:18:08.580]   and I didn't particularly like getting up
[03:18:08.580 --> 03:18:12.120]   to do the Pledge of Allegiance in school,
[03:18:12.120 --> 03:18:14.900]   because I realized it was an autocratic control system.
[03:18:14.900 --> 03:18:16.900]   Not that I didn't wanna pledge allegiance to the Republic,
[03:18:16.900 --> 03:18:21.100]   but that I got that this government wasn't America.
[03:18:21.100 --> 03:18:24.500]   Already by that point, that somebody captured the country,
[03:18:24.500 --> 03:18:29.500]   and so I was really saluting them, not the Republic.
[03:18:29.500 --> 03:18:33.820]   And I live here, so I should be saluting it.
[03:18:33.820 --> 03:18:35.780]   Or I shouldn't be, so everybody can know
[03:18:35.780 --> 03:18:36.960]   I'm not part of this.
[03:18:36.960 --> 03:18:40.260]   And see, America's got a horrible past
[03:18:40.260 --> 03:18:41.140]   and done a lot of bad things,
[03:18:41.140 --> 03:18:42.700]   but compared to other countries,
[03:18:42.700 --> 03:18:44.900]   from every other historical perspective,
[03:18:44.900 --> 03:18:46.660]   the Japanese, French, you name it,
[03:18:46.660 --> 03:18:50.220]   we were special and amazing and had amazing innovations,
[03:18:50.220 --> 03:18:52.900]   because we were about the little people being important,
[03:18:52.900 --> 03:18:54.300]   and the little people having ideas,
[03:18:54.300 --> 03:18:56.980]   and little people being able to compete,
[03:18:56.980 --> 03:18:58.500]   so the poorest person could end up,
[03:18:58.500 --> 03:19:01.100]   you know, be the head of the Navy or the top inventor,
[03:19:01.100 --> 03:19:03.360]   or an artist.
[03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:08.220]   And so it was that idea of what you stood for
[03:19:08.220 --> 03:19:10.220]   and what you did, not where you came from
[03:19:10.220 --> 03:19:11.460]   or what you look like,
[03:19:11.460 --> 03:19:13.180]   that Martin Luther King continued with.
[03:19:13.180 --> 03:19:14.880]   That's Americana, folks.
[03:19:14.880 --> 03:19:21.680]   And now you see the complete opposite of that.
[03:19:23.160 --> 03:19:26.600]   It's cultic, it's stupid, it's gangsterish,
[03:19:26.600 --> 03:19:29.680]   it's tribal, it's mindless, it's bad news.
[03:19:29.680 --> 03:19:32.960]   And so I remember also growing up
[03:19:32.960 --> 03:19:34.720]   and hearing how great Texas was,
[03:19:34.720 --> 03:19:36.680]   let's skip this break, guys,
[03:19:36.680 --> 03:19:40.400]   how great Texas was and how,
[03:19:40.400 --> 03:19:41.360]   we were the best and all this,
[03:19:41.360 --> 03:19:43.240]   and I would just roll my eyes and just think,
[03:19:43.240 --> 03:19:44.840]   my God, you should always do that to parents
[03:19:44.840 --> 03:19:47.640]   and grandparents, please quit talking about this and that,
[03:19:47.640 --> 03:19:49.160]   please stop.
[03:19:49.160 --> 03:19:50.960]   Then as I got older and I traveled the country
[03:19:50.960 --> 03:19:53.060]   and the world, and Texas isn't perfect,
[03:19:53.060 --> 03:19:58.060]   but real old Texas was just the end of chivalry.
[03:19:58.060 --> 03:20:03.040]   It was kind of the last frontier of men still being men
[03:20:03.040 --> 03:20:04.580]   or just that idea,
[03:20:04.580 --> 03:20:08.200]   like a Americana holdout.
[03:20:08.200 --> 03:20:09.440]   And then I understood.
[03:20:09.440 --> 03:20:19.060]   It's not that America is that good or Texas is that good,
[03:20:19.060 --> 03:20:22.120]   it's that everything else is so much worse.
[03:20:23.540 --> 03:20:25.500]   And we've turned our back on all of it.
[03:20:25.500 --> 03:20:31.060]   And they say you judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:20:31.060 --> 03:20:33.580]   Look at how many people fighting the new world order
[03:20:33.580 --> 03:20:34.700]   come from Texas,
[03:20:34.700 --> 03:20:38.580]   because of those ideals and believing in something.
[03:20:38.580 --> 03:20:40.500]   You all say, yeah, look at George Bush coming from it.
[03:20:40.500 --> 03:20:44.200]   No, that's people coming from Kenny Buckport, Maine,
[03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:48.060]   and I'm not bashing folks up in Maine or Connecticut.
[03:20:48.060 --> 03:20:49.420]   The point is those are the blue bloods
[03:20:49.420 --> 03:20:53.080]   that infest that area coming down here to rob us
[03:20:53.080 --> 03:20:54.960]   and then take on the mantle of Texas
[03:20:54.960 --> 03:20:57.280]   when they're the opposite of it.
[03:20:57.280 --> 03:20:59.720]   A hat and cowboy boots does not make you a Texan.
[03:20:59.720 --> 03:21:01.920]   And I don't wanna even sit there
[03:21:01.920 --> 03:21:03.560]   and lionize America or Texas.
[03:21:03.560 --> 03:21:06.880]   It's just that when people are pissing on the flag
[03:21:06.880 --> 03:21:09.400]   and pissing on the Star-Stangled Banner
[03:21:09.400 --> 03:21:10.800]   and the Pledge of Allegiance,
[03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:14.520]   they're pissing on what gave them $100 million contracts
[03:21:14.520 --> 03:21:16.640]   and jets and mansions and everything.
[03:21:16.640 --> 03:21:18.200]   Not that that's the best thing in the world,
[03:21:18.200 --> 03:21:20.940]   it's just that the byproduct of a little bit of freedom
[03:21:20.940 --> 03:21:25.740]   is fabulous wealth, medicine, culture, opportunities, ideas,
[03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:28.940]   and to watch a bunch of spoiled, rotten brats
[03:21:28.940 --> 03:21:31.220]   run around with political correctness
[03:21:31.220 --> 03:21:33.420]   and talk about everything that's good
[03:21:33.420 --> 03:21:37.460]   as if it's the worst thing in the world makes me really
[03:21:37.460 --> 03:21:42.860]   wanna involve myself in an Atlas Shrug type operation
[03:21:42.860 --> 03:21:45.420]   and just start pulling back and not caring.
[03:21:45.420 --> 03:21:47.600]   But that's what the elite did.
[03:21:47.600 --> 03:21:49.900]   They have that attitude the public is a bunch of scum
[03:21:49.900 --> 03:21:51.300]   and then they end up just going ahead
[03:21:51.300 --> 03:21:52.700]   and treating them like scum
[03:21:52.700 --> 03:21:54.460]   and so then it makes them act like scum
[03:21:54.460 --> 03:21:55.860]   and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:21:55.860 --> 03:21:59.300]   I will not lower myself to the level of the elite
[03:21:59.300 --> 03:22:00.500]   or the general public.
[03:22:00.500 --> 03:22:01.900]   I will not be part of it.
[03:22:01.900 --> 03:22:05.500]   And it's not because I'm some perfect person,
[03:22:05.500 --> 03:22:07.520]   it's because I can't do it.
[03:22:07.520 --> 03:22:12.100]   When I even start thinking like the establishment thinks,
[03:22:12.100 --> 03:22:13.340]   I get a chill up my spine
[03:22:15.900 --> 03:22:20.400]   because that's turning myself over to this spirit
[03:22:20.400 --> 03:22:24.440]   that I'm not gonna be part of
[03:22:24.440 --> 03:22:26.200]   and no matter how many concerns I've got
[03:22:26.200 --> 03:22:27.920]   or no matter what the danger is,
[03:22:27.920 --> 03:22:30.600]   my soul is in charge and it says,
[03:22:30.600 --> 03:22:33.660]   you are not going to join this ever.
[03:22:33.660 --> 03:22:37.080]   And it's that simple decision.
[03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:38.360]   Where does your soul lie?
[03:22:38.360 --> 03:22:39.320]   You don't have to go to some church
[03:22:39.320 --> 03:22:42.040]   with some jackass devil worshiping preacher.
[03:22:42.040 --> 03:22:44.700]   Half those sons of bitches are devil worshipers.
[03:22:44.700 --> 03:22:47.320]   You don't need to go to these big whore churches to find God.
[03:22:47.320 --> 03:22:48.720]   That's where you find the devil.
[03:22:48.720 --> 03:22:50.120]   You've got to make a decision in your heart
[03:22:50.120 --> 03:22:51.160]   who you stand for.
[03:22:51.160 --> 03:22:54.600]   Those Pharisees will tell you your bag
[03:22:54.600 --> 03:22:55.440]   as you drink a beer,
[03:22:55.440 --> 03:22:57.360]   you think God's creation, a woman's beautiful
[03:22:57.360 --> 03:22:59.240]   and Lord knows that can get out of hand.
[03:22:59.240 --> 03:23:02.120]   But the point is they want to make you feel guilty
[03:23:02.120 --> 03:23:04.520]   so you think you've got to go through them to find God.
[03:23:04.520 --> 03:23:06.880]   They're there to make sure you don't find God.
[03:23:06.880 --> 03:23:09.120]   Let me tell you something,
[03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:10.040]   in my 40 something years,
[03:23:10.040 --> 03:23:11.920]   I found God and I found the devil
[03:23:11.920 --> 03:23:13.400]   and I'm going with God all the way.
[03:23:13.400 --> 03:23:14.860]   Here's a special report on Haiti.
[03:23:14.860 --> 03:23:16.960]   We'll go to break, come back with Anthony Guggioretti.
[03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:19.540]   (upbeat music)
[03:23:19.540 --> 03:23:22.860]   - If you love black people,
[03:23:22.860 --> 03:23:25.060]   why are you destroying Haiti?
[03:23:25.060 --> 03:23:27.260]   Why did you, Mr. Clinton,
[03:23:27.260 --> 03:23:31.380]   stop them from the rice that they were producing
[03:23:31.380 --> 03:23:33.740]   in Haiti to feed themselves?
[03:23:33.740 --> 03:23:35.940]   - In this environment,
[03:23:35.940 --> 03:23:38.020]   the most important thing all the rest of us can do
[03:23:38.020 --> 03:23:41.140]   is give even small amounts of cash
[03:23:41.140 --> 03:23:44.560]   for food, medicine, water, and shelter.
[03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:46.360]   - You've got like the head of the Senate saying
[03:23:46.360 --> 03:23:47.560]   that the Clintons tried to bribe him.
[03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:49.360]   You've got local leaders saying
[03:23:49.360 --> 03:23:51.280]   how they think the Clintons do nothing,
[03:23:51.280 --> 03:23:53.360]   how they just collect all the money
[03:23:53.360 --> 03:23:54.360]   and it just breaks home.
[03:23:54.360 --> 03:23:56.240]   These people are damn evil.
[03:23:56.240 --> 03:23:59.000]   (dramatic music)
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:06.440]   - Young boy here with a severe injury.
[03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:08.000]   We're his only way out of here.
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:10.600]   And we're about to put him on our plane.
[03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:13.120]   The UN helicopter taken off is empty
[03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:14.840]   because they don't do evac.
[03:24:14.840 --> 03:24:16.640]   This is what's so frustrating here.
[03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:17.560]   No government help.
[03:24:17.560 --> 03:24:19.280]   They'll all bring in some food,
[03:24:19.280 --> 03:24:21.080]   but they won't do anything interesting
[03:24:21.080 --> 03:24:22.520]   like helping the individual.
[03:24:22.520 --> 03:24:25.240]   So we're getting him out of here.
[03:24:25.240 --> 03:24:28.360]   An old man on a stretcher with a spinal cord injury.
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:31.580]   And America needs to know what's going on here.
[03:24:31.580 --> 03:24:33.800]   This is an absolute disaster.
[03:24:33.800 --> 03:24:36.520]   And Obama sent in six or seven helicopters.
[03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:38.360]   They're all going home in a few days.
[03:24:38.360 --> 03:24:39.960]   And people are starving.
[03:24:39.960 --> 03:24:41.520]   They don't have no water.
[03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:42.360]   There's injuries.
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:43.640]   This person was injured in a hurricane,
[03:24:43.640 --> 03:24:45.440]   which was seven or eight days ago.
[03:24:45.440 --> 03:24:47.320]   And we're just now getting him to a hospital.
[03:24:47.320 --> 03:24:49.880]   So anybody who cares about this,
[03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:52.120]   cares about the Haitian people,
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:24:54.400]   you need to call your congressman.
[03:24:54.400 --> 03:24:55.320]   You need to call your media
[03:24:55.320 --> 03:24:57.360]   because this is a completely ignored story.
[03:24:57.360 --> 03:25:01.440]   A million people on this peninsula in Western Haiti
[03:25:01.440 --> 03:25:04.120]   without water, without food, without medical care.
[03:25:04.120 --> 03:25:07.280]   And very, very little was done,
[03:25:07.280 --> 03:25:10.360]   being done by the international community
[03:25:10.360 --> 03:25:12.720]   and by the American government.
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:15.760]   And so I saw only four stories in the entire media
[03:25:15.760 --> 03:25:17.680]   yesterday on the Haitian program.
[03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:19.920]   There's a million people in distress.
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:21.000]   This is important.
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:22.480]   - You've got the Clinton Foundation here,
[03:25:22.480 --> 03:25:23.440]   but guess where they're at?
[03:25:23.440 --> 03:25:24.720]   In Port-au-Prince,
[03:25:24.720 --> 03:25:27.080]   willing and dealing at the Marriott,
[03:25:27.080 --> 03:25:28.780]   trying to put money in their own pockets.
[03:25:28.780 --> 03:25:31.040]   Meanwhile, you got people here with their legs snapped,
[03:25:31.040 --> 03:25:32.920]   fractured backs, trying to get help,
[03:25:32.920 --> 03:25:33.760]   trying to get out of here,
[03:25:33.760 --> 03:25:35.360]   trying to seek the medical attention they deserve
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:36.500]   and they should have.
[03:25:36.500 --> 03:25:37.720]   And these people are more concerned
[03:25:37.720 --> 03:25:39.280]   with putting money in their own pockets
[03:25:39.280 --> 03:25:41.080]   and benefiting their lives and their families
[03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:41.920]   later on down the road.
[03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:43.160]   When you have people here.
[03:25:43.160 --> 03:25:44.920]   - Let me say, this guy's an EMT
[03:25:44.920 --> 03:25:46.960]   and he's been doing this for quite a while.
[03:25:46.960 --> 03:25:48.520]   How much Clinton fund money
[03:25:48.520 --> 03:25:51.240]   have you seen actually put into the hands of Haitians?
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:52.880]   - Absolutely nothing right now.
[03:25:52.880 --> 03:25:54.680]   'Cause we've been here since what?
[03:25:54.680 --> 03:25:55.600]   Last Wednesday?
[03:25:55.600 --> 03:25:56.440]   - Yep.
[03:25:56.440 --> 03:25:57.760]   - We haven't seen nothing yet.
[03:25:57.760 --> 03:26:00.280]   - Most of the Haitians consider Hillary Clinton a thief.
[03:26:00.280 --> 03:26:02.680]   Would that be an accurate description?
[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:03.760]   - I would say yes.
[03:26:03.760 --> 03:26:04.600]   - Yeah.
[03:26:04.600 --> 03:26:05.440]   - 'Cause that's what they, I mean,
[03:26:05.440 --> 03:26:08.820]   it's been going on for quite a while.
[03:26:08.820 --> 03:26:10.820]   - So January of 2010.
[03:26:10.820 --> 03:26:11.660]   - Yep.
[03:26:11.660 --> 03:26:12.480]   - Yeah.
[03:26:12.480 --> 03:26:13.320]   - And before that.
[03:26:13.320 --> 03:26:14.280]   - So this is it.
[03:26:14.280 --> 03:26:16.220]   - They're already digging their fingers in Haiti
[03:26:16.220 --> 03:26:17.060]   before it happened.
[03:26:17.060 --> 03:26:19.240]   And then when that catastrophic event took place,
[03:26:19.240 --> 03:26:21.180]   they seized it, jumped in here,
[03:26:21.180 --> 03:26:23.900]   and then took a hold of that natural disaster
[03:26:23.900 --> 03:26:25.580]   and then used it as a way to benefit themselves.
[03:26:25.580 --> 03:26:27.180]   And that's what they always do.
[03:26:27.180 --> 03:26:29.300]   - And we have absolute proof
[03:26:29.300 --> 03:26:31.860]   that the Clintons have put nothing into Haiti
[03:26:31.860 --> 03:26:35.040]   other than getting a gold mine for Hillary's brother
[03:26:35.040 --> 03:26:37.700]   and their rich friends.
[03:26:37.700 --> 03:26:39.740]   - I don't see major organizations down here.
[03:26:39.740 --> 03:26:41.900]   I don't see major organizations out in that area.
[03:26:41.900 --> 03:26:43.420]   We're the only ones out there.
[03:26:43.420 --> 03:26:45.620]   HERO is literally the only one out there
[03:26:45.620 --> 03:26:47.020]   in Danmuri doing this work.
[03:26:47.020 --> 03:26:49.440]   And Danmuri is one of the most affected areas
[03:26:49.440 --> 03:26:50.980]   where the hurricane went through
[03:26:50.980 --> 03:26:53.300]   and devastated the entire town.
[03:26:53.300 --> 03:26:54.740]   So we have a bunch of people without homes,
[03:26:54.740 --> 03:26:56.680]   without food, without shelter,
[03:26:56.680 --> 03:26:58.500]   and in need of medical assistance.
[03:26:58.500 --> 03:27:02.380]   So that in itself should be screaming out to the world
[03:27:02.380 --> 03:27:04.940]   that yes, we need eyes back on Haiti
[03:27:04.940 --> 03:27:06.820]   because we can't do it alone.
[03:27:06.820 --> 03:27:08.820]   We desperately need help.
[03:27:08.820 --> 03:27:10.540]   - You know, what's amazing,
[03:27:10.540 --> 03:27:15.540]   aside from some small-scale US military aid
[03:27:15.540 --> 03:27:19.220]   and some other Christian organizations,
[03:27:19.220 --> 03:27:21.220]   you know, I mean, yesterday I looked around,
[03:27:21.220 --> 03:27:23.380]   I thought, I wonder where the religion of peace is at.
[03:27:23.380 --> 03:27:24.220]   You know what?
[03:27:24.220 --> 03:27:26.540]   Why aren't these guys down here helping out?
[03:27:26.540 --> 03:27:27.780]   Where's the Clinton Foundation
[03:27:27.780 --> 03:27:30.060]   that's collected hundreds of millions of dollars
[03:27:30.060 --> 03:27:33.140]   for the earthquake and dispensed,
[03:27:33.140 --> 03:27:34.860]   you know, if these Haitian people were lucky,
[03:27:34.860 --> 03:27:37.180]   they got 10 cents on the dollar out of that.
[03:27:37.180 --> 03:27:38.980]   You know, there's just,
[03:27:38.980 --> 03:27:40.900]   and I think the large part of it
[03:27:40.900 --> 03:27:42.180]   is really the blame on the media.
[03:27:42.180 --> 03:27:44.300]   The media hasn't covered the story.
[03:27:44.300 --> 03:27:46.340]   I mean, this country's devastated.
[03:27:46.340 --> 03:27:48.500]   - Haiti Air Ambulance, a great organization
[03:27:48.500 --> 03:27:50.520]   with a beautiful helicopter,
[03:27:50.520 --> 03:27:56.100]   ambulance staff wants to come here and take our patients,
[03:27:56.100 --> 03:28:00.180]   but they can't go round trip on one tank of gas, okay?
[03:28:00.180 --> 03:28:02.580]   The only people they can get gas from out here
[03:28:02.580 --> 03:28:04.300]   is do this stuff, do this stuff.
[03:28:04.300 --> 03:28:06.300]   And they won't sell them gas,
[03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:08.540]   and because they need it for their operation.
[03:28:08.540 --> 03:28:12.380]   They won't let us do medevacs on U.N. planes.
[03:28:12.380 --> 03:28:17.380]   They won't let us do medevacs on the Army planes.
[03:28:17.380 --> 03:28:20.500]   - The Army won't let you do medevacs, right?
[03:28:20.500 --> 03:28:21.340]   - The Army won't let it.
[03:28:21.340 --> 03:28:22.580]   They won't come here and take our people.
[03:28:22.580 --> 03:28:24.940]   - Tell us what the Clinton Foundation's done for you.
[03:28:24.940 --> 03:28:27.300]   (laughing)
[03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:29.220]   - Where's the Clinton Foundation?
[03:28:29.220 --> 03:28:30.420]   - Where's everybody?
[03:28:30.420 --> 03:28:32.300]   - Gary and Diana have been down here
[03:28:32.300 --> 03:28:34.300]   with their own caravans.
[03:28:34.300 --> 03:28:36.460]   They came down with three planes,
[03:28:36.460 --> 03:28:39.620]   and we've been providing help to Dan-Marie,
[03:28:39.620 --> 03:28:42.380]   Le-Kai, and Jeremy.
[03:28:42.380 --> 03:28:46.420]   They have been the only ones able to distribute
[03:28:46.420 --> 03:28:51.420]   to about 3,000 people, basically food, water, oil,
[03:28:51.420 --> 03:28:56.580]   the basic needs for any human being.
[03:28:56.580 --> 03:28:58.660]   We don't see the Red Cross.
[03:28:58.660 --> 03:29:01.300]   We haven't seen the Clinton Foundation
[03:29:01.300 --> 03:29:02.700]   doing anything in Haiti.
[03:29:02.700 --> 03:29:08.660]   We are the only ones medevac-ing those trauma people,
[03:29:08.660 --> 03:29:12.220]   and Dan-Marie, we're the only flights landing there,
[03:29:12.220 --> 03:29:14.820]   getting people out that need to be medevac-ed.
[03:29:14.820 --> 03:29:18.140]   - My friends, we're gonna upload this video.
[03:29:18.140 --> 03:29:19.220]   There's a few more minutes left to it.
[03:29:19.220 --> 03:29:21.660]   The next hour at InfoWars.com.
[03:29:21.660 --> 03:29:22.580]   Please get it out to everybody.
[03:29:22.580 --> 03:29:24.420]   Anthony Gucciardi is about to take over,
[03:29:24.420 --> 03:29:26.540]   and then I'm gonna be here with the rest of the crew,
[03:29:26.540 --> 03:29:29.500]   popping in and out right through past midnight tonight.

[03:29:47.780 --> 03:29:50.740]   - We're on the march.
[03:29:50.740 --> 03:29:53.220]   The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.220 --> 03:29:56.220]   Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:56.820 --> 03:29:59.980]   (electronic whirring)
[03:29:59.980 --> 03:30:04.500]   - There's an article up on our website on InfoWars.com
[03:30:04.500 --> 03:30:06.060]   written by Clifford Cunningham
[03:30:06.060 --> 03:30:08.940]   that addresses one anonymous Navy official
[03:30:08.940 --> 03:30:11.300]   telling Alaskans, "Prepare for war."
[03:30:11.300 --> 03:30:14.260]   This official suggests that Russia is preparing an invasion
[03:30:14.260 --> 03:30:15.940]   in response to US strikes.
[03:30:15.940 --> 03:30:18.860]   He's unnamed, but he's warned the residents of Alaska
[03:30:18.860 --> 03:30:21.060]   to prepare for an invasion in the event of war
[03:30:21.060 --> 03:30:22.660]   between the US and Russia.
[03:30:22.660 --> 03:30:23.660]   This is what he said.
[03:30:23.660 --> 03:30:26.260]   "We're on the verge of being invaded from Alaska
[03:30:26.260 --> 03:30:27.740]   "all the way down into Canada
[03:30:27.740 --> 03:30:29.420]   "and eventually to the Northwest."
[03:30:29.420 --> 03:30:32.300]   He said the invasion will begin via submarine
[03:30:32.300 --> 03:30:33.740]   near the city of Wasilla,
[03:30:33.740 --> 03:30:36.740]   approximately 43 miles northeast of Anchorage.
[03:30:36.740 --> 03:30:40.020]   Wasilla is located along the coast of Nick Arm,
[03:30:40.020 --> 03:30:42.740]   a body of water that branches into the Cook Inlet,
[03:30:42.740 --> 03:30:45.020]   which flows west into the Gulf of Alaska.
[03:30:45.020 --> 03:30:47.100]   He goes on to say, "Our feeling in the Navy
[03:30:47.100 --> 03:30:50.660]   "was that Obama has turned Alaska into a defenseless area
[03:30:50.660 --> 03:30:53.100]   "that will serve as a forward base of operations
[03:30:53.100 --> 03:30:54.820]   "when World War III begins."
[03:30:54.820 --> 03:30:58.100]   I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:30:58.100 --> 03:31:01.500]   - InfoWars is proud to announce

[03:31:30.260 --> 03:31:32.580]   and it was completely built from the ground up.
[03:31:32.580 --> 03:31:34.220]   We've seen example after example
[03:31:34.220 --> 03:31:36.420]   of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[03:31:36.420 --> 03:31:38.740]   In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated
[03:31:38.740 --> 03:31:40.300]   by well-financed political forces
[03:31:40.300 --> 03:31:41.820]   who are trying to sway public opinion
[03:31:41.820 --> 03:31:43.140]   and in a natural direction
[03:31:43.140 --> 03:31:45.300]   that only serves establishment agendas.
[03:31:45.300 --> 03:31:48.340]   But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press
[03:31:48.340 --> 03:31:50.300]   that is rapidly losing influence.

[03:31:55.340 --> 03:31:58.140]   instead of being spoon-fed lies by the mainstream media.
[03:31:58.140 --> 03:31:59.940]   (upbeat music)
[03:31:59.940 --> 03:32:02.940]   - Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:32:02.940 --> 03:32:05.460]   - Because of what we did on this day,
[03:32:05.460 --> 03:32:06.980]   change has come to America.
[03:32:06.980 --> 03:32:09.620]   - Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[03:32:09.620 --> 03:32:12.540]   I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[03:32:12.540 --> 03:32:16.060]   - The nation has been hijacked by international forces,
[03:32:16.060 --> 03:32:18.300]   bent on global governance.
[03:32:18.300 --> 03:32:21.820]   When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag,
[03:32:21.820 --> 03:32:24.460]   heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:32:24.460 --> 03:32:27.940]   God was in school, morality had a future,
[03:32:27.940 --> 03:32:30.700]   and beef was for supper.
[03:32:30.700 --> 03:32:33.700]   Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:32:33.700 --> 03:32:35.740]   - We're the solution, Americans.
[03:32:35.740 --> 03:32:37.340]   Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[03:32:37.340 --> 03:32:40.100]   - Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels,
[03:32:40.100 --> 03:32:42.780]   and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:32:42.780 --> 03:32:46.380]   Theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[03:32:46.380 --> 03:32:49.860]   - You wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:32:49.860 --> 03:32:52.740]   Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[03:32:52.740 --> 03:32:55.500]   Americans need to see this film.
[03:32:55.500 --> 03:32:58.180]   Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[03:32:58.180 --> 03:32:59.220]   Let's fix it.
[03:32:59.220 --> 03:33:04.220]   (upbeat music)
[03:33:04.220 --> 03:33:13.860]   - The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:15.860 --> 03:33:19.180]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.180 --> 03:33:22.020]   ♪ Sarah was completely wasting ♪
[03:33:22.020 --> 03:33:25.140]   ♪ Out of work and down ♪
[03:33:25.140 --> 03:33:27.140]   - You know, when you watch a video like that,
[03:33:27.140 --> 03:33:29.740]   the Haiti video, and you think about
[03:33:29.740 --> 03:33:30.940]   what you're really looking at,
[03:33:30.940 --> 03:33:33.860]   you're looking at a group of people
[03:33:33.860 --> 03:33:37.300]   that have been completely deceived by charities,
[03:33:37.300 --> 03:33:40.220]   so-called charities, so-called help aid groups
[03:33:40.220 --> 03:33:45.100]   that took money and then not only did nothing with it,
[03:33:45.100 --> 03:33:47.940]   but chose to use the money for something else
[03:33:47.940 --> 03:33:50.340]   as people are actually suffering and dying.
[03:33:50.340 --> 03:33:51.780]   There's people dying on camera.
[03:33:51.780 --> 03:33:55.140]   Spoke to Michael Zimmerman, who shot all of that,
[03:33:55.140 --> 03:33:58.140]   and it's disturbing, right?
[03:33:58.140 --> 03:33:58.980]   And you think about that,
[03:33:58.980 --> 03:34:01.740]   you think how could we get to a point
[03:34:01.740 --> 03:34:06.060]   where they're the only ones going down there?
[03:34:06.060 --> 03:34:08.500]   They're the only ones shipping down the food.
[03:34:08.500 --> 03:34:10.700]   There's some relief groups and everything helping them,
[03:34:10.700 --> 03:34:13.260]   but Gary is the only one
[03:34:13.260 --> 03:34:16.180]   out of billions of people in the world.
[03:34:16.180 --> 03:34:17.300]   He also has the resources,
[03:34:17.300 --> 03:34:19.620]   but going down there and helping those people,
[03:34:19.620 --> 03:34:22.380]   and you think about it, how do we get to that point?
[03:34:22.380 --> 03:34:24.780]   How do we get to the point globally
[03:34:24.780 --> 03:34:25.700]   with everything that's happening?
[03:34:25.700 --> 03:34:28.740]   Like, how do we possibly get to this level
[03:34:28.740 --> 03:34:32.340]   where you look at it and you say, what is going on?
[03:34:32.340 --> 03:34:33.940]   How is this possible?
[03:34:33.940 --> 03:34:36.060]   And also you think about how did we get
[03:34:36.060 --> 03:34:36.940]   where we are as a country?
[03:34:36.940 --> 03:34:38.220]   You think over and over and over again.
[03:34:38.220 --> 03:34:39.340]   That's why they say, of course,
[03:34:39.340 --> 03:34:41.860]   that there's the election syndrome,
[03:34:41.860 --> 03:34:43.300]   the election anxiety syndrome,
[03:34:43.300 --> 03:34:45.100]   that people are having panic attacks
[03:34:45.100 --> 03:34:46.940]   because the election is so crazy.
[03:34:46.940 --> 03:34:50.860]   Well, everything is getting more and more out in the open.
[03:34:50.860 --> 03:34:52.220]   Right, you have an article like this,
[03:34:52.220 --> 03:34:55.780]   "UK admits it spied illegally for 17 years."
[03:34:55.780 --> 03:34:58.580]   It's sorry, but it won't stop.
[03:34:58.580 --> 03:35:00.180]   "Sorry we spied on you for 17 years,
[03:35:00.180 --> 03:35:01.620]   but we're not gonna do anything about it."
[03:35:01.620 --> 03:35:05.660]   Right, so much of it is all just in the open now.
[03:35:05.660 --> 03:35:08.580]   And one of those things is about
[03:35:08.580 --> 03:35:10.180]   the hormone disrupting chemicals.
[03:35:10.180 --> 03:35:11.140]   We're gonna talk to Dr. Group
[03:35:11.140 --> 03:35:12.940]   about this news piece here in a moment.
[03:35:12.940 --> 03:35:15.260]   But years and years and years ago,
[03:35:15.260 --> 03:35:16.820]   five, six, seven years ago,
[03:35:16.820 --> 03:35:21.260]   we were always talking about hormone disrupting chemicals.
[03:35:21.260 --> 03:35:22.140]   Alex was talking about it.
[03:35:22.140 --> 03:35:24.060]   I would write articles about it.
[03:35:24.060 --> 03:35:26.220]   I challenged Susan G. Komen for the Cure,
[03:35:26.220 --> 03:35:28.660]   the massive anti-breast cancer charity,
[03:35:28.660 --> 03:35:31.540]   to actually list BPA as avoiding BPA
[03:35:31.540 --> 03:35:34.380]   as one of the ways to prevent breast cancer.
[03:35:34.380 --> 03:35:37.180]   Back then it was like 130 studies showing it, right?
[03:35:37.180 --> 03:35:40.460]   Now, oh, but you're crazy then, by the way.
[03:35:40.460 --> 03:35:42.740]   You're totally insane and it's not scientific.
[03:35:42.740 --> 03:35:43.920]   It's unfounded.
[03:35:43.920 --> 03:35:44.760]   You're crazy.
[03:35:44.760 --> 03:35:46.500]   It's not an issue.
[03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:48.700]   But of course, yesterday an article comes out
[03:35:48.700 --> 03:35:51.260]   that hormone disrupting chemicals are responsible
[03:35:51.260 --> 03:35:56.260]   for at least $340 billion in health-related costs.
[03:35:56.260 --> 03:35:58.820]   It's just killing people,
[03:35:58.820 --> 03:36:02.180]   and it's costing $340 billion in health-related costs
[03:36:02.180 --> 03:36:04.460]   because people are eating the junk.
[03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:06.540]   They're getting it in water bottles.
[03:36:06.540 --> 03:36:08.340]   We're gonna talk about that with Dr. Group.
[03:36:08.340 --> 03:36:12.100]   So what is happening where our brains
[03:36:12.100 --> 03:36:13.520]   are almost like short-circuiting
[03:36:13.520 --> 03:36:14.680]   because there's so much going on?
[03:36:14.680 --> 03:36:17.960]   That's what's happening, is it's all out.
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:20.420]   We are aware the establishment system screwed us.
[03:36:20.420 --> 03:36:21.620]   We are sold a lie.
[03:36:21.620 --> 03:36:23.640]   People are pissed off.
[03:36:23.640 --> 03:36:25.580]   The establishment system, meanwhile,
[03:36:25.580 --> 03:36:28.100]   instead of even pretending that everything is fine,
[03:36:28.100 --> 03:36:29.900]   there's a little bit of that with the media.
[03:36:29.900 --> 03:36:31.300]   There's a small percentage of people
[03:36:31.300 --> 03:36:33.460]   that still trust the mega media
[03:36:33.460 --> 03:36:34.580]   to the point where they just think,
[03:36:34.580 --> 03:36:35.980]   you're right, everything's fine.
[03:36:35.980 --> 03:36:37.660]   Everyone has our best interests at heart.
[03:36:37.660 --> 03:36:39.740]   There's no way anything could be going on.
[03:36:39.740 --> 03:36:41.820]   But what is actually happening is
[03:36:41.820 --> 03:36:44.500]   the information overload of our brains,
[03:36:44.500 --> 03:36:47.020]   we can't even digest it.
[03:36:47.020 --> 03:36:48.540]   We can't digest it.
[03:36:48.540 --> 03:36:50.420]   There's tons of articles talking about this.
[03:36:50.420 --> 03:36:52.660]   Neuroscientists say multitasking
[03:36:52.660 --> 03:36:55.820]   literally drains the energy reserves of your brain,
[03:36:55.820 --> 03:36:59.180]   and that is in terms of using a smartphone,
[03:36:59.180 --> 03:37:00.020]   reading the news,
[03:37:00.020 --> 03:37:02.060]   doing all the things that we're doing.
[03:37:02.060 --> 03:37:02.980]   We're going to go through some of this,
[03:37:02.980 --> 03:37:04.140]   but psychology today,
[03:37:04.140 --> 03:37:05.300]   flooding your brain's engine,
[03:37:05.300 --> 03:37:07.180]   how you can have too much of a good thing.
[03:37:07.180 --> 03:37:10.260]   Multitasking damages your brain and career.
[03:37:10.260 --> 03:37:12.100]   How technology is warping your memory.
[03:37:12.100 --> 03:37:13.940]   Basically what's happening,
[03:37:13.940 --> 03:37:15.700]   and I do want to get Dr. Group's take on this too,
[03:37:15.700 --> 03:37:16.940]   he's been patiently waiting,
[03:37:16.940 --> 03:37:19.100]   is we're flooded with all this.
[03:37:19.100 --> 03:37:20.860]   Do you even remember what the big scandal was
[03:37:20.860 --> 03:37:22.660]   six months ago or two months ago
[03:37:22.660 --> 03:37:24.300]   or maybe even just a month ago?
[03:37:24.300 --> 03:37:25.140]   Do you even remember?
[03:37:25.140 --> 03:37:28.780]   Do you even remember the massive banking institutions
[03:37:28.780 --> 03:37:30.820]   that have been paying millions and millions of dollars
[03:37:30.820 --> 03:37:34.060]   of fines for money laundering with drug cartels?
[03:37:34.060 --> 03:37:36.060]   I mean, do we even remember the fact
[03:37:36.060 --> 03:37:39.060]   that we're paying over $183 billion a year
[03:37:39.060 --> 03:37:41.780]   in taxpayer money to the banks due to the bailouts?
[03:37:41.780 --> 03:37:45.820]   I mean, how much of this is actually actively on your mind?
[03:37:45.820 --> 03:37:48.100]   Probably zero, probably none of it,
[03:37:48.100 --> 03:37:50.500]   because we're just constantly just hit
[03:37:50.500 --> 03:37:52.380]   with all this junk every single day.
[03:37:52.380 --> 03:37:55.060]   We can't compute it all in our brains,
[03:37:55.060 --> 03:37:56.220]   and then we forget about it,
[03:37:56.220 --> 03:37:57.620]   and it just continues.
[03:37:57.620 --> 03:38:00.340]   Just like we're not gonna do anything about the fact
[03:38:00.340 --> 03:38:01.900]   that Haiti is crushed,
[03:38:01.900 --> 03:38:03.980]   and all the groups that claim they were gonna help them
[03:38:03.980 --> 03:38:06.060]   that received millions of dollars of funding
[03:38:06.060 --> 03:38:08.020]   and did nothing about it.
[03:38:08.020 --> 03:38:11.100]   Instead, Gary Haven and InfoWars
[03:38:11.100 --> 03:38:12.820]   have to fly down on a private jet
[03:38:12.820 --> 03:38:15.500]   and unload millions of dollars of food.
[03:38:15.500 --> 03:38:18.900]   All right, Dr. Group, I want to get your thoughts on this,
[03:38:18.900 --> 03:38:21.900]   and also talk about this truth
[03:38:21.900 --> 03:38:23.260]   that hormone-disrupting chemicals,
[03:38:23.260 --> 03:38:25.060]   we've been saying this for like 10 years,
[03:38:25.060 --> 03:38:26.620]   are actually killing people
[03:38:26.620 --> 03:38:28.140]   and costing $340 billion a year,
[03:38:28.140 --> 03:38:30.300]   but back then it was not a real thing.
[03:38:30.300 --> 03:38:32.580]   I mean, do you not see all of this just so open now?
[03:38:32.580 --> 03:38:34.060]   It's just, it's overwhelming.
[03:38:34.060 --> 03:38:36.220]   - Yeah, a lot of it, I think,
[03:38:36.220 --> 03:38:38.940]   has to do with everything that Alex has been talking about,
[03:38:38.940 --> 03:38:40.660]   everything that you've been posting online,
[03:38:40.660 --> 03:38:42.980]   everything that we've been posting online.
[03:38:42.980 --> 03:38:44.700]   The fact that people are waking up
[03:38:44.700 --> 03:38:49.700]   and realizing that the healthcare system is chaotic.
[03:38:49.700 --> 03:38:51.940]   They've seen their parents die,
[03:38:51.940 --> 03:38:53.980]   all the chemicals they're aware of now,
[03:38:53.980 --> 03:38:56.700]   they're becoming more aware of all this stuff.
[03:38:56.700 --> 03:38:58.260]   That's, just think about that,
[03:38:58.260 --> 03:39:03.260]   $340 billion associated with hormone-disrupting chemicals,
[03:39:03.260 --> 03:39:07.820]   and those are gonna be in practically
[03:39:07.820 --> 03:39:12.180]   every day item products that you have around your house,
[03:39:12.180 --> 03:39:14.260]   tens of thousands of products,
[03:39:14.260 --> 03:39:17.660]   anything with plastic, anything with food containers,
[03:39:17.660 --> 03:39:20.300]   detergents, flame retardants, toys
[03:39:20.300 --> 03:39:23.100]   that your kids are playing with, cosmetics,
[03:39:23.100 --> 03:39:26.060]   neurological and behavioral problems
[03:39:26.060 --> 03:39:27.300]   these things are causing.
[03:39:27.300 --> 03:39:30.020]   They're causing sterility in males,
[03:39:30.020 --> 03:39:32.660]   attention deficit disorder, autism, loss of--
[03:39:32.660 --> 03:39:35.140]   - Yeah, if you just read this article, it's crazy.
[03:39:35.140 --> 03:39:36.260]   Listen to what it says.
[03:39:36.260 --> 03:39:38.380]   It says, "So-called endocrine-disrupting chemicals,"
[03:39:38.380 --> 03:39:41.140]   so-called, "EDCs, are found in thousands
[03:39:41.140 --> 03:39:42.940]   "of everyday products ranging from plastic
[03:39:42.940 --> 03:39:44.460]   "and metal food containers, detergents,
[03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:46.380]   "flame retardants, toys, and cosmetics," right?
[03:39:46.380 --> 03:39:48.300]   And then the next paragraph, it says,
[03:39:48.300 --> 03:39:50.820]   "Neurological damage, behavior problems,
[03:39:50.820 --> 03:39:53.540]   "including attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder,
[03:39:53.540 --> 03:39:56.500]   "autism, loss of IQ, accounted for at least
[03:39:56.500 --> 03:39:57.820]   "four-fifths of these impacts."
[03:39:57.820 --> 03:40:01.380]   So they say, as we've known this for years,
[03:40:01.380 --> 03:40:03.380]   yeah, it's in everything, just like you're saying,
[03:40:03.380 --> 03:40:05.700]   Dr. Group, it's in everything.
[03:40:05.700 --> 03:40:08.060]   It's in everyday products, it's in nonstick pans,
[03:40:08.060 --> 03:40:11.380]   it's in the dollar bill, it's in this printed out article
[03:40:11.380 --> 03:40:13.980]   right here, the BPA, the BPS, everything.
[03:40:13.980 --> 03:40:16.260]   It's all in all these consumer goods,
[03:40:16.260 --> 03:40:21.220]   and it's causing loss of IQ and autism and ADHD.
[03:40:21.220 --> 03:40:22.540]   That's okay, though.
[03:40:22.540 --> 03:40:24.260]   But then we'll forget about it tomorrow,
[03:40:24.260 --> 03:40:27.100]   and we'll say, "What can we do about ADHD?
[03:40:27.100 --> 03:40:28.060]   "What can we do?"
[03:40:28.060 --> 03:40:30.220]   Well, it's, "There's nothing we can do."
[03:40:30.220 --> 03:40:31.660]   You know, how absurd is that?
[03:40:31.660 --> 03:40:35.240]   - It's pretty absurd, considering if you really look in,
[03:40:35.240 --> 03:40:38.180]   this study, by the way, was done by the Lancet,
[03:40:38.180 --> 03:40:41.580]   published by the Lancet, Diabetes and Endocrinology.
[03:40:41.580 --> 03:40:43.700]   But the biggest culprit, the biggest
[03:40:43.700 --> 03:40:47.100]   endocrine-disrupting chemical in this study,
[03:40:47.100 --> 03:40:50.420]   by far, among the man-made chemicals
[03:40:50.420 --> 03:40:52.540]   and all these endocrine-disrupting compounds
[03:40:52.540 --> 03:40:54.500]   is the organobromine compounds,
[03:40:54.500 --> 03:40:57.380]   which are the, actually what we call PBDEs,
[03:40:57.380 --> 03:41:00.220]   polybrominated diphenyl ethers.
[03:41:00.220 --> 03:41:02.980]   And you know how much we've talked about iodine
[03:41:02.980 --> 03:41:04.900]   and the attack on the thyroid
[03:41:04.900 --> 03:41:07.020]   and the attack on the endocrine system
[03:41:07.020 --> 03:41:10.620]   by the other toxic halogens,
[03:41:10.620 --> 03:41:13.020]   which are bromine, fluoride, and chlorine.
[03:41:13.020 --> 03:41:15.500]   So it all goes back, if you look at the research,
[03:41:15.500 --> 03:41:18.100]   why in the world are these things allowed?
[03:41:18.100 --> 03:41:21.300]   Why are these chemicals allowed into our civilization?
[03:41:21.300 --> 03:41:23.340]   Not only do they destroy the human,
[03:41:23.340 --> 03:41:25.140]   but they also destroy the earth.
[03:41:25.140 --> 03:41:27.140]   But think about that.
[03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:30.980]   The most damaging element
[03:41:30.980 --> 03:41:35.020]   of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals is the organobromine.
[03:41:35.020 --> 03:41:37.500]   And we know that bromine, chlorine, and fluoride
[03:41:37.500 --> 03:41:38.700]   fight for the receptor sites.
[03:41:38.700 --> 03:41:41.100]   There's iodine receptor sites
[03:41:41.100 --> 03:41:42.620]   on every single cell in the body.
[03:41:42.620 --> 03:41:46.260]   And we wonder why we have so many thyroid issues,
[03:41:46.260 --> 03:41:49.420]   ovarian cancer, prostate problems, breast.
[03:41:49.420 --> 03:41:50.660]   I mean, it doesn't matter.
[03:41:50.660 --> 03:41:53.820]   Any type of disease can be associated
[03:41:53.820 --> 03:41:55.380]   with these toxic compounds.
[03:41:55.380 --> 03:41:56.740]   And that's why it's so important
[03:41:56.740 --> 03:41:58.460]   to be on iodine every single day
[03:41:58.460 --> 03:42:00.700]   is because how are you gonna fight that?
[03:42:00.700 --> 03:42:02.380]   You know, you gotta get rid of all your toys
[03:42:02.380 --> 03:42:04.140]   and clean up your diet and everything else.
[03:42:04.140 --> 03:42:07.380]   But, you know, like you said earlier,
[03:42:07.380 --> 03:42:08.980]   right now is a crazy time.
[03:42:08.980 --> 03:42:10.220]   I mean, not only in Haiti,
[03:42:10.220 --> 03:42:12.220]   but all around the world people are suffering.
[03:42:12.220 --> 03:42:13.700]   And, you know, there was another article
[03:42:13.700 --> 03:42:17.460]   that came out by the "Psychology Today,"
[03:42:17.460 --> 03:42:20.660]   which is talking about election stress disorder,
[03:42:20.660 --> 03:42:24.460]   that 50% of the, and not just in America, but-
[03:42:24.460 --> 03:42:27.140]   - Right, which is a real thing right now.
[03:42:27.140 --> 03:42:29.100]   It's a real condition.
[03:42:29.100 --> 03:42:30.100]   It's a new term, right?
[03:42:30.100 --> 03:42:31.820]   It's people that are so stressed out
[03:42:31.820 --> 03:42:34.180]   by the so-called election thing.
[03:42:34.180 --> 03:42:35.860]   Really, I think what they're stressed out about
[03:42:35.860 --> 03:42:38.100]   is the fact that they're seeing the truth
[03:42:38.100 --> 03:42:40.260]   of what their country is really like, right?
[03:42:40.260 --> 03:42:42.900]   They're seeing the truth of what the system,
[03:42:42.900 --> 03:42:45.580]   so-called, is actually doing.
[03:42:45.580 --> 03:42:47.540]   Because if more than anything,
[03:42:47.540 --> 03:42:49.300]   I think the election has kind of
[03:42:49.300 --> 03:42:52.660]   pulled the veil back a little bit, right?
[03:42:52.660 --> 03:42:54.980]   It doesn't even mean that like one person
[03:42:54.980 --> 03:42:55.820]   is so great or whatever.
[03:42:55.820 --> 03:42:58.500]   It just means, wow, all this is actually going on
[03:42:58.500 --> 03:43:00.860]   because the gloves came off for the first time.
[03:43:00.860 --> 03:43:01.700]   But go ahead.
[03:43:01.700 --> 03:43:04.180]   - No, that's true.
[03:43:04.180 --> 03:43:07.020]   You have, like, let's just say 50% of the people
[03:43:07.020 --> 03:43:10.260]   that are in fear right now that Hillary will win,
[03:43:10.260 --> 03:43:12.500]   and then you got 50% of the people out there
[03:43:12.500 --> 03:43:15.340]   that are in fear right now that Trump will win.
[03:43:15.340 --> 03:43:17.540]   So basically, you've created a society of,
[03:43:17.540 --> 03:43:22.020]   regardless who wins or who anybody's rooting for,
[03:43:22.020 --> 03:43:23.900]   it's 100% fear.
[03:43:23.900 --> 03:43:27.180]   And that's not the type of society that we wanna live in.
[03:43:27.180 --> 03:43:29.860]   And as a matter of fact, it was pretty comical
[03:43:29.860 --> 03:43:33.020]   that the American Psychological Association
[03:43:33.020 --> 03:43:36.220]   actually published some stuff on how to cope
[03:43:36.220 --> 03:43:38.500]   with election stress.
[03:43:38.500 --> 03:43:42.220]   And one of them is to limit media consumption.
[03:43:42.220 --> 03:43:45.700]   And the other one is to stop having conflicting discussions
[03:43:45.700 --> 03:43:47.940]   about the election.
[03:43:47.940 --> 03:43:51.300]   The other one is know that whatever happens,
[03:43:51.300 --> 03:43:52.780]   life will go on.
[03:43:52.780 --> 03:43:55.260]   - Stop disagreeing with people.
[03:43:55.260 --> 03:43:57.340]   No more debate discussions.
[03:43:57.340 --> 03:43:58.300]   - Yeah, that's crazy.
[03:43:58.300 --> 03:44:00.700]   And then the last one is go vote.
[03:44:00.700 --> 03:44:06.020]   - So in other words, it's kind of like many other things.
[03:44:06.540 --> 03:44:10.100]   It's not exactly the best way to prevent or cure anything.
[03:44:10.100 --> 03:44:11.740]   - Yeah, it's just like nobody addresses
[03:44:11.740 --> 03:44:13.580]   the root cause of any problems.
[03:44:13.580 --> 03:44:15.380]   I mean, everybody is still addressing
[03:44:15.380 --> 03:44:16.900]   the symptoms of everything.
[03:44:16.900 --> 03:44:18.980]   - Which is systemic.
[03:44:18.980 --> 03:44:21.140]   It's weird because as above, so below, right?
[03:44:21.140 --> 03:44:23.580]   If you look at the fact that no one addresses
[03:44:23.580 --> 03:44:25.620]   the root cause of things at a health level,
[03:44:25.620 --> 03:44:26.980]   right, at a cellular level,
[03:44:26.980 --> 03:44:29.940]   in terms of if you go in with something wrong with you,
[03:44:29.940 --> 03:44:31.180]   they don't say, "Well, what's your lifestyle like?
[03:44:31.180 --> 03:44:32.020]   "What's your diet like?"
[03:44:32.020 --> 03:44:35.740]   Well, so is the political system, kind of like organism.
[03:44:35.740 --> 03:44:37.340]   And we're not diagnosing it properly.
[03:44:37.340 --> 03:44:38.940]   We're just looking at all the little symptoms,
[03:44:38.940 --> 03:44:40.260]   like all the little latest scandals
[03:44:40.260 --> 03:44:42.820]   we're always freaking out about as a society.
[03:44:42.820 --> 03:44:45.180]   We're always looking at the littlest, tiniest things.
[03:44:45.180 --> 03:44:46.860]   It's almost like I've said before,
[03:44:46.860 --> 03:44:49.580]   we have a microscope in front of our eyes
[03:44:49.580 --> 03:44:50.820]   and that's all we could see.
[03:44:50.820 --> 03:44:52.780]   Or like a massive magnifying glass,
[03:44:52.780 --> 03:44:55.940]   we can only see one little thing and it's dictated,
[03:44:55.940 --> 03:44:58.300]   or they at least tried to be dictated by the media.
[03:44:58.300 --> 03:45:01.420]   So we don't see the full so-called holistic view, right?
[03:45:01.420 --> 03:45:04.660]   Because we can apply this over and over again to everything.
[03:45:04.660 --> 03:45:06.580]   Why are we not making a firm diagnosis
[03:45:06.580 --> 03:45:09.100]   on the state of society and the world,
[03:45:09.100 --> 03:45:11.180]   as opposed to hitting things with hammers,
[03:45:11.180 --> 03:45:12.180]   with gophers everywhere?
[03:45:12.180 --> 03:45:14.380]   It's never ever gonna work.
[03:45:14.380 --> 03:45:18.020]   - Yeah, The Guardian just released a study that said,
[03:45:18.020 --> 03:45:18.860]   that came out and said,
[03:45:18.860 --> 03:45:22.180]   "We could prevent millions of cancer deaths
[03:45:22.180 --> 03:45:25.140]   "with knowledge we already have."
[03:45:25.140 --> 03:45:29.020]   Hello, that's what we've been saying for the last 20 years.
[03:45:29.020 --> 03:45:31.020]   Cancer deaths right now worldwide
[03:45:31.020 --> 03:45:34.260]   are estimated to increase by over 50%,
[03:45:34.260 --> 03:45:36.900]   between 2015 and 2030.
[03:45:36.900 --> 03:45:37.940]   It's rampant.
[03:45:37.940 --> 03:45:40.460]   Liver cancer, I've been talking about this for a long time.
[03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:42.420]   Heal the gut, heal the body.
[03:45:42.420 --> 03:45:44.020]   Clean the liver, clean the body.
[03:45:44.020 --> 03:45:46.220]   You get a new gut tissue every 24 hours.
[03:45:46.220 --> 03:45:48.620]   You get new liver every three months.
[03:45:48.620 --> 03:45:51.180]   It's the two fastest regenerating organs.
[03:45:51.180 --> 03:45:54.340]   Do you think that there was a reason that God did that?
[03:45:54.340 --> 03:45:56.360]   Because he knew that we were gonna be processing
[03:45:56.360 --> 03:45:58.140]   so many chemicals and toxins.
[03:45:58.140 --> 03:46:01.580]   And now liver cancer is the second most common cause
[03:46:01.580 --> 03:46:03.060]   of cancer death worldwide.
[03:46:03.060 --> 03:46:04.380]   - Well, just look at this article, right?
[03:46:04.380 --> 03:46:05.660]   So from The Guardian,
[03:46:05.660 --> 03:46:07.500]   "We could prevent millions of cancer deaths
[03:46:07.500 --> 03:46:09.260]   "with knowledge we already have."
[03:46:09.260 --> 03:46:10.300]   And what's interesting,
[03:46:10.300 --> 03:46:12.100]   they don't even get into a lot of things in this.
[03:46:12.100 --> 03:46:14.420]   It's more of just basic prevention and stuff
[03:46:14.420 --> 03:46:15.900]   in like third world countries and things.
[03:46:15.900 --> 03:46:18.600]   - Oh, they say only 50% of the girls
[03:46:18.600 --> 03:46:20.640]   are getting the HPV vaccine,
[03:46:20.640 --> 03:46:23.780]   and that all of them need to get the HPV vaccine
[03:46:23.780 --> 03:46:26.820]   so we can prevent 50% of possible ovarian cancer.
[03:46:26.820 --> 03:46:27.660]   - Right, and they talk about--
[03:46:27.660 --> 03:46:30.260]   - All they're saying to do is increase drug use
[03:46:30.260 --> 03:46:32.080]   and increase vaccines.
[03:46:32.080 --> 03:46:33.820]   And that's how you're gonna prevent cancer.
[03:46:33.820 --> 03:46:36.300]   - Right, now look at the juxtaposition though here.
[03:46:36.300 --> 03:46:37.740]   This is from the New Zealand Herald
[03:46:37.740 --> 03:46:38.820]   'cause it just had a better title
[03:46:38.820 --> 03:46:40.420]   than the Reuters, it's the same thing.
[03:46:40.420 --> 03:46:43.060]   But says, this is New Zealand Herald,
[03:46:43.060 --> 03:46:44.300]   "Chemicals and everyday products
[03:46:44.300 --> 03:46:46.100]   "linked to cancer, autism, diabetes."
[03:46:46.100 --> 03:46:47.660]   It's talking about the endocrine disruptors
[03:46:47.660 --> 03:46:50.980]   and about how it costs $340 billion to deal with that
[03:46:50.980 --> 03:46:52.160]   and it's killing people, right?
[03:46:52.160 --> 03:46:56.420]   So look at that, and then look at something like this.
[03:46:56.420 --> 03:46:58.280]   The Guardian, "We could prevent millions of cancer deaths
[03:46:58.280 --> 03:46:59.980]   "with knowledge we already have," right?
[03:46:59.980 --> 03:47:03.160]   So even the Guardian piece didn't even venture into that.
[03:47:03.160 --> 03:47:04.900]   It didn't even venture into the concept
[03:47:04.900 --> 03:47:06.700]   of what we're eating is killing us,
[03:47:06.700 --> 03:47:07.900]   what we're drinking is killing us.
[03:47:07.900 --> 03:47:08.980]   And I don't mean to sit here and say
[03:47:08.980 --> 03:47:09.860]   that everything we're doing,
[03:47:09.860 --> 03:47:12.100]   you're gonna die of cancer, it's horrible.
[03:47:12.100 --> 03:47:13.200]   No, it's not like that.
[03:47:13.200 --> 03:47:16.100]   It's simple systems that could be fixed
[03:47:16.100 --> 03:47:19.200]   at the root systemic level from the producers of all this.
[03:47:19.200 --> 03:47:22.780]   InfoWars Life doesn't have a bunch of stuff in it
[03:47:22.780 --> 03:47:24.420]   that's gonna kill you and give you cancer.
[03:47:24.420 --> 03:47:27.440]   It's simple, as a producer, as a manufacturer,
[03:47:27.440 --> 03:47:28.980]   you don't have to choose to do that.
[03:47:28.980 --> 03:47:30.420]   So it's like this article,
[03:47:30.420 --> 03:47:32.100]   "Factory farming could lead us to, quote,
[03:47:32.100 --> 03:47:34.780]   "antibiotic apocalypse," this is from the Canary,
[03:47:34.780 --> 03:47:36.100]   and it talks about what we already know,
[03:47:36.100 --> 03:47:39.060]   70% of antibiotics are dumped into the livestock.
[03:47:39.060 --> 03:47:41.500]   It's used as a preventative now.
[03:47:41.500 --> 03:47:42.740]   So it's the animals aren't even sick,
[03:47:42.740 --> 03:47:45.940]   you just dump antibiotics into them in case they get sick
[03:47:45.940 --> 03:47:48.980]   because you can't lose profits if the animal dies.
[03:47:48.980 --> 03:47:50.920]   And as long as it's sustained just enough,
[03:47:50.920 --> 03:47:52.340]   like even if it's on the brink of death,
[03:47:52.340 --> 03:47:55.660]   just enough to sell it, that's all that matters.
[03:47:55.660 --> 03:47:59.620]   So it's not like a pipe dream or something.
[03:47:59.620 --> 03:48:01.260]   People always criticize and say,
[03:48:01.260 --> 03:48:02.780]   "Well, everything gives you cancer,
[03:48:02.780 --> 03:48:04.780]   "you can't do anything about it."
[03:48:04.780 --> 03:48:08.340]   Well, number one, you can at an individual level, 100%,
[03:48:08.340 --> 03:48:11.340]   but number two, this platform can be utilized
[03:48:11.340 --> 03:48:13.460]   to actually change things as it has been.
[03:48:13.460 --> 03:48:17.060]   Numerous successes, numerous victories, activism victories,
[03:48:17.060 --> 03:48:18.940]   but it's at a systemic level
[03:48:18.940 --> 03:48:21.020]   when the producers decide to do something about it.
[03:48:21.020 --> 03:48:23.500]   Just like the political organism,
[03:48:23.500 --> 03:48:25.780]   it's not like sitting here talking about this
[03:48:25.780 --> 03:48:27.700]   is doing nothing and going into the ether,
[03:48:27.700 --> 03:48:30.300]   it's actually affecting things globally
[03:48:30.300 --> 03:48:32.500]   and then the producers in the political climate,
[03:48:32.500 --> 03:48:33.500]   just as the health climate,
[03:48:33.500 --> 03:48:35.500]   are forced to actually do something about it.
[03:48:35.500 --> 03:48:38.780]   - You know, I think that we're really blessed
[03:48:38.780 --> 03:48:42.960]   to be on the planet at this particular time.
[03:48:42.960 --> 03:48:45.100]   I mean, yes, we're dealing with a lot of stuff,
[03:48:45.100 --> 03:48:48.420]   but we're also dealing with radical change at the same time.
[03:48:48.420 --> 03:48:50.780]   And every single day that we come in
[03:48:50.780 --> 03:48:52.580]   and all of the people that are learning
[03:48:52.580 --> 03:48:54.580]   more and more and more about their health,
[03:48:54.580 --> 03:48:55.660]   it's we the people.
[03:48:55.660 --> 03:48:58.580]   I mean, cleansing, for example,
[03:48:58.580 --> 03:49:01.620]   has been used in the ancient Egyptian times,
[03:49:01.620 --> 03:49:03.340]   I mean, ancient Roman times,
[03:49:03.340 --> 03:49:05.340]   they all used olive oil to cleanse the liver.
[03:49:05.340 --> 03:49:08.340]   That's why the truth never changes,
[03:49:08.340 --> 03:49:09.900]   it stands the test of time.
[03:49:09.900 --> 03:49:14.820]   And all civilizations had ways of cleansing the earth
[03:49:14.820 --> 03:49:16.500]   and cleansing the body.
[03:49:16.500 --> 03:49:18.460]   And now more and more people are starting to wake up
[03:49:18.460 --> 03:49:22.060]   to that fact and realize, see, we're manipulated from birth
[03:49:22.060 --> 03:49:25.140]   because we're taught that we have to look outside
[03:49:25.140 --> 03:49:26.220]   for everything else.
[03:49:26.220 --> 03:49:28.380]   We have to look outside for the answers.
[03:49:28.380 --> 03:49:30.340]   We have to go to a doctor to heal us.
[03:49:30.340 --> 03:49:32.220]   We have to go over here to do this.
[03:49:32.220 --> 03:49:35.220]   And we have to learn in the own educational system,
[03:49:35.220 --> 03:49:37.540]   which completely shuts us down
[03:49:37.540 --> 03:49:39.540]   from knowing where our true power is.
[03:49:39.540 --> 03:49:42.240]   I mean, we were born with the best
[03:49:42.240 --> 03:49:45.060]   and most effective healing modalities
[03:49:45.060 --> 03:49:47.620]   in the world is inside you.
[03:49:47.620 --> 03:49:49.840]   It's your self-healing mechanism.
[03:49:49.840 --> 03:49:51.340]   You know, when you have that hope
[03:49:51.340 --> 03:49:52.460]   and you have that faith
[03:49:52.460 --> 03:49:54.900]   and you are not in a state of fear,
[03:49:54.900 --> 03:49:58.060]   not in a state of anxiety, not in a state of stress,
[03:49:58.060 --> 03:50:00.300]   and you know how to keep your body clean,
[03:50:00.300 --> 03:50:03.580]   you keep your gut healthy and you keep your liver clean,
[03:50:03.580 --> 03:50:04.700]   then there's nothing.
[03:50:04.700 --> 03:50:07.540]   That's what activates your body's self-healing mechanism
[03:50:07.540 --> 03:50:10.340]   and keeps you strong and keeps you powerful.
[03:50:10.340 --> 03:50:11.860]   You know, listen, the powers to be
[03:50:11.860 --> 03:50:14.420]   are very, very scared of one thing.
[03:50:14.420 --> 03:50:17.340]   That is if people learn how to meditate.
[03:50:17.340 --> 03:50:19.420]   There have been many, many studies done,
[03:50:19.420 --> 03:50:22.700]   over 50 documented studies by,
[03:50:22.700 --> 03:50:24.340]   you can go to World Peace Group,
[03:50:24.340 --> 03:50:28.020]   and it's called the 1% Radiance Effect.
[03:50:28.020 --> 03:50:32.700]   And it's proven that if 1% of any given population,
[03:50:32.700 --> 03:50:35.620]   let's say there's 100,000 people in a city,
[03:50:35.620 --> 03:50:39.140]   and 1% of those people start meditating,
[03:50:39.140 --> 03:50:42.460]   it's been proven that you can literally change society
[03:50:42.460 --> 03:50:44.380]   with your thoughts and through meditation.
[03:50:44.380 --> 03:50:45.860]   - Dr. Group, we got to go to break.
[03:50:45.860 --> 03:50:46.780]   Thank you for coming on the show.

[03:54:10.420 --> 03:54:17.060]   - So I wanna talk a little bit about Ecuador
[03:54:17.060 --> 03:54:19.500]   saying it cut off WikiLeaks' internet,
[03:54:19.500 --> 03:54:22.740]   or rather, Julian Assange's internet through its own embassy.
[03:54:22.740 --> 03:54:27.420]   But first, also, I wanna remind you at Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:27.420 --> 03:54:29.100]   I mean, today is the final debate.
[03:54:29.100 --> 03:54:32.180]   It is now time to fund groups you actually care about
[03:54:32.180 --> 03:54:33.700]   and you're interested in.
[03:54:33.700 --> 03:54:35.660]   Groups that are willing to do things
[03:54:35.660 --> 03:54:37.780]   like fly someone down to Haiti
[03:54:37.780 --> 03:54:39.380]   and document the entire thing
[03:54:39.380 --> 03:54:42.300]   and assist amazing people like Gary Haven
[03:54:42.300 --> 03:54:44.500]   in feeding Haitians that are not being helped
[03:54:44.500 --> 03:54:46.020]   by any of the groups that got millions and millions of
[03:54:46.020 --> 03:54:47.820]   dollars but just refuse to do it.
[03:54:47.820 --> 03:54:49.700]   So Infowarslife.com,
[03:54:49.700 --> 03:54:54.020]   BrainForce is an amazing nootropic neural activation formula.
[03:54:54.020 --> 03:54:55.500]   It really, really works.
[03:54:55.500 --> 03:54:57.420]   You don't get like crashy, groggy feelings,
[03:54:57.420 --> 03:54:58.900]   or for me at least, I don't get that.
[03:54:58.900 --> 03:55:01.500]   And it's an amazing formula
[03:55:01.500 --> 03:55:04.420]   that has hundreds of five-star reviews.
[03:55:04.420 --> 03:55:06.220]   And it's 25% off.
[03:55:06.220 --> 03:55:08.220]   So if you've tried it before, you wanna stock up.
[03:55:08.220 --> 03:55:10.980]   If you've never tried it, now is the absolute time to do it.
[03:55:10.980 --> 03:55:13.540]   And once again, these are not formulas
[03:55:13.540 --> 03:55:16.420]   that just get cranked out, that are junk,
[03:55:16.420 --> 03:55:18.220]   that we just say, well, you know what?
[03:55:18.220 --> 03:55:19.980]   We can save some money, it doesn't matter.
[03:55:19.980 --> 03:55:22.500]   It's not like the chickens that the factory farms
[03:55:22.500 --> 03:55:25.300]   just dump full of antibiotics so they don't die,
[03:55:25.300 --> 03:55:27.340]   or at least don't die long enough
[03:55:27.340 --> 03:55:28.900]   with their chronic conditions
[03:55:28.900 --> 03:55:31.020]   so they can be slaughtered up and eaten, right?
[03:55:31.020 --> 03:55:32.300]   This is the real deal stuff.
[03:55:32.300 --> 03:55:34.780]   It's actually curated and taken care of.
[03:55:34.780 --> 03:55:39.460]   So BrainForce, 25% off today is the day to do it
[03:55:39.460 --> 03:55:42.020]   because the special will be down soon.
[03:55:42.020 --> 03:55:43.580]   So InfoWarsLife.com,
[03:55:43.580 --> 03:55:45.260]   support things you actually believe in
[03:55:45.260 --> 03:55:47.640]   instead of buying just a Starbucks coffee in the morning,
[03:55:47.640 --> 03:55:49.480]   which is like $20 anyway,
[03:55:49.480 --> 03:55:51.500]   buy something that is going to help you in your life
[03:55:51.500 --> 03:55:53.820]   and support something that is doing good.
[03:55:53.820 --> 03:55:55.860]   Now let's talk about this.
[03:55:55.860 --> 03:55:58.980]   The Guardian, Ecuador says it cut WikiLeaks founders'
[03:55:58.980 --> 03:56:02.140]   internet over interference in US election.
[03:56:02.140 --> 03:56:05.020]   Now you think about the damage control level
[03:56:05.020 --> 03:56:08.620]   that we see, it's pathetic, right?
[03:56:08.620 --> 03:56:11.500]   Not just in this particular instance, right?
[03:56:11.500 --> 03:56:14.740]   But the concept that, oh,
[03:56:14.740 --> 03:56:17.100]   they're interfering in the election,
[03:56:17.100 --> 03:56:19.860]   just like Russia's interfering in the election
[03:56:19.860 --> 03:56:23.100]   by releasing all the things that Hillary Clinton's doing.
[03:56:23.100 --> 03:56:25.660]   Or you could say like, oh, well,
[03:56:25.660 --> 03:56:29.420]   activists online are interfering in the election
[03:56:29.420 --> 03:56:33.460]   by talking about Hillary Clinton's past.
[03:56:33.460 --> 03:56:34.300]   What?
[03:56:34.300 --> 03:56:36.180]   Interfering in the election?
[03:56:36.180 --> 03:56:39.660]   I thought we were trying to make more informed decisions.
[03:56:39.660 --> 03:56:40.500]   Right?
[03:56:40.500 --> 03:56:42.260]   I thought if you have more information,
[03:56:42.260 --> 03:56:44.220]   you can make a more informed decision
[03:56:44.220 --> 03:56:45.460]   about which candidate you want to support.
[03:56:45.460 --> 03:56:46.840]   No, no, no, no.
[03:56:46.840 --> 03:56:49.700]   That's interfering in the elections.
[03:56:49.700 --> 03:56:51.340]   You say, well, but it's just information
[03:56:51.340 --> 03:56:54.460]   about what they're doing and it's showing it to the public
[03:56:54.460 --> 03:56:56.100]   that they're supposed to elect their leader
[03:56:56.100 --> 03:56:57.180]   based on that kind of stuff.
[03:56:57.180 --> 03:56:58.700]   And no.
[03:56:58.700 --> 03:57:01.300]   So now it's interfering in the election
[03:57:01.300 --> 03:57:03.420]   at the lowest levels of anything you do.
[03:57:03.420 --> 03:57:05.100]   So talking about this article
[03:57:05.100 --> 03:57:06.960]   is interfering in the election,
[03:57:06.960 --> 03:57:09.460]   according to this weird nomenclature, right?
[03:57:09.460 --> 03:57:13.020]   So I guess anything now could be interfering.
[03:57:13.020 --> 03:57:15.620]   So you actually can't present information
[03:57:15.620 --> 03:57:17.500]   and news that's been presented to you.
[03:57:17.500 --> 03:57:19.860]   Like Julian Assange gets this information about Hillary
[03:57:19.860 --> 03:57:22.900]   that he says, wow, this is really powerful stuff.
[03:57:22.900 --> 03:57:25.540]   We need to have the public aware of this.
[03:57:25.540 --> 03:57:26.700]   That's interfering in the election.
[03:57:26.700 --> 03:57:29.380]   So it's no longer informing people.
[03:57:29.380 --> 03:57:32.340]   Cops have a database of 117 million faces.
[03:57:32.340 --> 03:57:34.260]   You're probably in it.
[03:57:34.260 --> 03:57:35.620]   This is from Wired.
[03:57:35.620 --> 03:57:37.420]   "It's no secret that the American law
[03:57:37.420 --> 03:57:39.540]   has been building facial recognition databases
[03:57:39.540 --> 03:57:40.740]   to aid in its investigations.
[03:57:40.740 --> 03:57:42.060]   But a new comprehensive report
[03:57:42.060 --> 03:57:43.340]   on the status of facial recognition
[03:57:43.340 --> 03:57:44.700]   as a tool in law enforcement
[03:57:44.700 --> 03:57:45.940]   shows the sheer scope and reach
[03:57:45.940 --> 03:57:47.860]   of the FBI's database of faces
[03:57:47.860 --> 03:57:51.340]   and those of state level law enforcement agencies.
[03:57:51.340 --> 03:57:52.780]   Roughly half of American adults
[03:57:52.780 --> 03:57:54.380]   are included in those collections.
[03:57:54.380 --> 03:57:56.140]   And that massive assembly of biometric data
[03:57:56.140 --> 03:57:58.540]   is accessible with spotty oversight."
[03:57:58.540 --> 03:58:02.020]   So here's my question too on the whole police thing.
[03:58:02.020 --> 03:58:05.340]   Why are we so obsessed with local level police actions
[03:58:05.340 --> 03:58:06.500]   that may or may not be bad?
[03:58:06.500 --> 03:58:08.740]   And no one cares anymore about the fact
[03:58:08.740 --> 03:58:10.980]   that there's millions, half of Americans faces
[03:58:10.980 --> 03:58:13.860]   are in these databases with virtually no oversight.
[03:58:13.860 --> 03:58:16.100]   No one knows what's really being done with them.
[03:58:16.100 --> 03:58:19.060]   They're being shared with corporations and things.
[03:58:19.060 --> 03:58:21.860]   But people don't get mad about that, right?
[03:58:21.860 --> 03:58:23.980]   We just have lost our focus in so many different ways.
[03:58:23.980 --> 03:58:26.620]   Not that other things that are happening aren't bad,
[03:58:26.620 --> 03:58:27.860]   but these are the kind of things
[03:58:27.860 --> 03:58:29.740]   that are now being glossed over.
[03:58:29.740 --> 03:58:31.740]   I'm Anthony Gucciardi and this broadcast
[03:58:31.740 --> 03:58:33.220]   is gonna continue all night long
[03:58:33.220 --> 03:58:35.740]   with live debate coverage from Alex
[03:58:35.740 --> 03:58:38.740]   and everyone else at InfoWars, so stay tuned.
