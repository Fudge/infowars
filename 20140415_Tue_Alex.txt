[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:35.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.360 --> 00:40.720]  while the world's been purposely distracted by the mind-controlled
[00:40.720 --> 00:47.440]  technocrats with the missing Malaysian plane and the latest pop culture fluff
[00:47.440 --> 00:52.080]  Ukraine military has recaptured an eastern airport held by pro-russian
[00:52.080 --> 00:58.560]  forces Russia says Ukraine close to civil war as Kiev begins offensive
[00:58.560 --> 01:02.800]  reportedly directed by the Central Intelligence Agency that's in Reuters
[01:02.800 --> 01:09.640]  Ukraine begins offensive did you did you hear that into the areas that have
[01:09.640 --> 01:12.920]  voted 90 plus percent to be part of Russia and have historically been part of
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.520]  Russia I've told you that's where the clash comes with areas on their own
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.720]  seceding over to Russia and then will Russia defend those that are voting to
[01:22.720 --> 01:28.200]  leave and generally the way this would go is Russia would end up taking part of
[01:28.200 --> 01:32.760]  the country all the way to the river the entire east all the way to Kiev and then
[01:32.760 --> 01:37.200]  stopping similar to the Germany being split into east and west but in this
[01:37.200 --> 01:42.160]  case the globalists are even worse than Russia clearly the Russians I would say
[01:42.160 --> 01:46.280]  were the bad guys in the Cold War but the globalists use them as the bad guys
[01:46.280 --> 01:53.160]  to make us the bad guys and build a police state here as well in the name of
[01:53.160 --> 01:59.240]  countering their police state this is just a huge huge development to wounded
[01:59.240 --> 02:03.480]  in skirmishes in eastern Ukraine gunfire eastern Ukraine airport as troops
[02:03.480 --> 02:08.360]  move in retaking it from pro-russia forces Ukraine falters in drive to curb
[02:08.360 --> 02:13.560]  unrest in the east fragile Europe weakens US push for Russia sanctions
[02:13.560 --> 02:18.400]  mainly because Germany's not going along with all of it Russian jets passes near
[02:18.400 --> 02:23.920]  US ship and Black Sea provocative the Pentagon says yeah it is what the West
[02:23.920 --> 02:32.440]  is doing is provocative Russia test multi warhead ICBM or a MIRV ICBM very
[02:32.440 --> 02:36.120]  provocative this is the type of news don't worry Obama has had a phone
[02:36.120 --> 02:42.080]  conversation Obama has had a phone conversation with Putin so he's on it
[02:42.080 --> 02:46.600]  everything's fine and again the issue is Ukraine voted four months ago three
[02:46.600 --> 02:54.880]  months ago not to join the EU and the George Soros NATO globalists activated
[02:54.880 --> 03:02.320]  the NGOs activated and they spent five billion dollars there the last few years
[03:02.320 --> 03:06.160]  that's not debated and they over to the country but there's gonna be Russians
[03:06.160 --> 03:11.040]  that don't want to be basically culturally cleansed in the east by the
[03:11.040 --> 03:16.360]  predominantly more you could say historically more German affiliated
[03:16.360 --> 03:20.520]  Ukrainians effect a bunch of them really are just Germans and of course Hitler
[03:20.520 --> 03:25.880]  went in there and took over to quote get the Germanic or Aryan Ukrainians I
[03:25.880 --> 03:29.300]  mean this just goes over and over the Nazis have done war crimes there the
[03:29.300 --> 03:33.200]  Russians have done huge war crimes there some of the greatest crimes ever
[03:33.200 --> 03:36.400]  have been committed against the Ukrainian people I get why a lot of
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.320]  Ukrainians are anti-Russian but it doesn't matter Russia's been part of
[03:40.320 --> 03:45.200]  Ukraine off and on forever and so it's just it's like black versus white and
[03:45.200 --> 03:48.920]  these people basically you know share a lot of culture pretty much look the
[03:48.920 --> 03:53.160]  same but they're divided by a river they're divided by Catholic and
[03:53.160 --> 03:57.960]  Orthodox and it's just the same story over and over again kill kill kill let's
[03:57.960 --> 04:01.000]  be divided and conquered by the globalist we're gonna come in and
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.960]  enslave everybody the new threat is the synthetic anti-human dehumanization
[04:06.960 --> 04:12.080]  technocratic new world order it's the big enchilada it's the big end of days
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.720]  system of it wins it's the end of humans as we know it the rise of the robots and
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.040]  humans better get that through their heads and decide whether we want to
[04:21.040 --> 04:29.400]  align ourselves along ideas of freedom liberty private property shared wish for
[04:29.400 --> 04:33.960]  humans to uplift ourselves or whether we're gonna continue to be divided and
[04:33.960 --> 04:38.840]  conquered along all these ethnic religious racial lines which can be real
[04:38.840 --> 04:41.920]  differences at the end of the day but but the issue is the globalists are
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.240]  synthetically manipulating those differences and playing them off against
[04:46.240 --> 04:51.200]  each other instead of using those differences to truly enrich the global
[04:51.200 --> 04:55.640]  culture and the globalist wage war against any strong culture that's its
[04:55.640 --> 05:04.320]  ultimate sin from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our
[05:04.320 --> 05:08.680]  world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the

[05:12.640 --> 05:16.520]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans

[05:25.480 --> 05:29.360]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact
[05:29.360 --> 05:32.920]  that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I
[05:32.920 --> 05:36.600]  began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start

[09:24.120 --> 09:32.120]  Clive and Bundy will be popping in to give us his take in the next hour
[09:32.120 --> 09:37.120]  dealing with the statements by Ron Paul and others Ron Paul warns
[09:37.120 --> 09:42.120]  feds could launch Waco style assault against Bundy that stories top link
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.120]  on DrudgeReport.com along with Harry Reid's statement to local TV news
[09:47.120 --> 09:52.120]  line a moment saying that it's not over and having a very smug sickening
[09:52.120 --> 09:59.120]  gangster Cheshire cat smile on his disgusting criminal face
[09:59.120 --> 10:05.120]  by the way Dinesh Jesus has been charged for giving $20,000 allegedly to
[10:05.120 --> 10:12.120]  Senate friend who was running for the Senate and Reid got $30,000 to his
[10:12.120 --> 10:17.120]  daughter on record and isn't in trouble and you know that's another example
[10:17.120 --> 10:23.120]  about where the Democrats are allowed to commit every crime you can imagine
[10:23.120 --> 10:29.120]  in campaign finance and anyone else libertarian independent Green Party
[10:29.120 --> 10:34.120]  conservative Republican will be thrown under the jail if you have a crooked
[10:34.120 --> 10:39.120]  toenail so we've got Ron Paul warns feds could launch Waco style assault
[10:39.120 --> 10:43.120]  against Bundy another big article that just went up on infoworks.com
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.120]  or be breaking down if we get into Ukraine feds desperate to hide Harry
[10:47.120 --> 10:53.120]  Reid's link to Bundy land grab and Paul's also writing an article this is
[10:53.120 --> 10:57.120]  a video where he breaks it down and shows that they've even removed the
[10:57.120 --> 11:02.120]  Google cash now from the BLM website saying we've got to get his land
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.120]  for the solar farm because see you can't have Glenn Beck saying we're
[11:07.120 --> 11:13.120]  making that up and you can't have MSNBC and media matters and George Soros
[11:13.120 --> 11:17.120]  saying that if you've got the BLM saying we've been told get him off the
[11:17.120 --> 11:24.120]  land for the solar farm and our boss is Harry Reid's former chief advisor
[11:24.120 --> 11:29.120]  no you got to hope nobody goes and looks that up so you can have Scarborough
[11:29.120 --> 11:33.120]  and you on MSNBC and you can have media matters doing five six articles a day
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.120]  directly for the White House you can have Glenn Beck running around saying
[11:38.120 --> 11:43.120]  there's no connection and the Chinese dropped their bid a year ago for now
[11:43.120 --> 11:48.120]  because they couldn't get the Bundy land it says it in the stinking document
[11:48.120 --> 11:53.120]  they need it to run the power lines over and it's quote mitigation area what
[11:53.120 --> 11:56.120]  they do is they grab this land in the desert first thing it's environmental
[11:56.120 --> 11:59.120]  and they go oh it's okay because this land will be off use for now and that's
[11:59.120 --> 12:05.120]  Bundy's property and the stinking tortoises the red herring tortoises
[12:05.120 --> 12:09.120]  actually like tortoises but you know what I mean the stinking red herring
[12:09.120 --> 12:13.120]  of the tortoises and I don't look I've pledged to not attack Glenn Beck
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.120]  and I haven't attacked him when he's getting sued and and and I think he
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.120]  does a lot of good but I've been sent the clips day after day attacking us
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.120]  and fine I turn the other cheek I understand you're high up in the Mormon
[12:25.120 --> 12:29.120]  hierarchy and Harry Reid's in there and I understand that a lot of Mormons
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.120]  are mad at Harry Reid and they should be clearly electronic voting machines
[12:33.120 --> 12:36.120]  are keeping him in office most independent polls show him incredibly
[12:36.120 --> 12:42.120]  unpopular close to 70% in Nevada he's a kingpin and a lot of you know
[12:42.120 --> 12:46.120]  heats going on out there and a lot of people you know if they can't stand
[12:46.120 --> 12:52.120]  the heat get out of the kitchen and I don't want to make this show about
[12:52.120 --> 12:56.120]  other talk show host I want to say Sean Hannity's done a good job covering
[12:56.120 --> 13:00.120]  the land rights issue with the Bundy Ranch and has covered it pretty fairly
[13:00.120 --> 13:03.120]  a lot of other big talk show hosts have and I'm going to be talking about why
[13:03.120 --> 13:07.120]  this is so important on April 15th here in just a moment and tied into
[13:07.120 --> 13:15.120]  Obamacare but I'm really sick and tired of getting the government documents
[13:15.120 --> 13:20.120]  where they have 2.6 billion bullets and then seeing national media come out
[13:20.120 --> 13:25.120]  and say they're not buying the bullets MSNBC Media Matters White House
[13:25.120 --> 13:28.120]  writes their talking points weekly on record they admit it and then to have
[13:28.120 --> 13:32.120]  Beck come out and say I'm making up the bullets he did that last year
[13:32.120 --> 13:36.120]  I'm making up drones I'm making up world government and he'd say that
[13:36.120 --> 13:39.120]  five years ago I'm making up FEMA camps even though it's the civilian
[13:39.120 --> 13:43.120]  inmate labor camp program declassified the emergency centers establishment
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.120]  act Rex 84 cable splicer garden plot I mean I'm listing stuff where you can
[13:47.120 --> 13:52.120]  type it in and get Miami Herald Associated Press I mean they just count on
[13:52.120 --> 13:58.120]  you being ignorant
[13:58.120 --> 14:01.120]  and and you know how the media will always try to point out that oh we're
[14:01.120 --> 14:04.120]  lying they'll go look here's an article where they bought 20 million rounds
[14:04.120 --> 14:08.120]  or here's an article where they bought 100 million rounds see it's not 2.6
[14:08.120 --> 14:13.120]  billion not adding all the numbers up we should have a master article done
[14:13.120 --> 14:17.120]  that just shows all of them line item last time I counted up it was 2.6
[14:17.120 --> 14:23.120]  billion that they've purchased enough to fight 40 years of war it was 27
[14:23.120 --> 14:28.120]  40 years of war in Iraq at its height with paper targets training to take
[14:28.120 --> 14:33.120]  on the militia gun owners libertarians conservatives army times
[14:33.120 --> 14:39.120]  stars and stripes Forbes AP Reuters New York Times all of them admitting
[14:39.120 --> 14:44.120]  training to take on the tea party that's the new main enemy we broke that we
[14:44.120 --> 14:48.120]  expose that six years ago first and we got all the ridicule for it and I'll
[14:48.120 --> 14:54.120]  tell you what's sick is I get to see all the jealous talk show host pile on
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.120]  and say oh you shouldn't watch the coverage of Alex Jones info wars.com
[14:59.120 --> 15:03.120]  on the Bundy thing they're not credible when these are literally many of these
[15:03.120 --> 15:07.120]  talk show host that I've promoted and tried to help these people most of them
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.120]  are not involved in liberty movement for liberty they're involved to try to be
[15:11.120 --> 15:15.120]  big shots and they're primitively competitive with anyone they see as
[15:15.120 --> 15:22.120]  competition I'm not your competition dumbass all of you out there this thing

[15:52.120 --> 15:55.120]  there were people better at this than me I wish there were people that had
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.120]  courage I wish there were people that worked hard and did research I wish
[15:59.120 --> 16:04.120]  that was going on because I don't like being the very tip of the spear always
[16:04.120 --> 16:10.120]  walking point for 19 years over and over again I want to believe in humanity
[16:10.120 --> 16:17.120]  I want to believe another talk show host I want to believe the only national
[16:17.120 --> 16:22.120]  talk show host other than George Norrie who who has had me on their show and
[16:22.120 --> 16:26.120]  promoted what we're doing and who isn't into some ego maniac war with me is
[16:26.120 --> 16:30.120]  Michael Savage because Michael Savage knows and he's certainly not perfect
[16:30.120 --> 16:35.120]  neither am I that if the globalists win they're going to put us in forced
[16:35.120 --> 16:40.120]  labor camps you understand that's the plan of the progressive communist dirt bag
[16:40.120 --> 16:47.120]  scum if we don't get together and come together ladies and gentlemen it's over
[16:47.120 --> 16:50.120]  and I'll tell you something else all these other talk show hosts there's a
[16:50.120 --> 16:54.120]  bunch of them attacking me are jealous that drudge report dot com links to us
[16:54.120 --> 16:59.120]  every day well if you sent your reporters there and shot high death video of the
[16:59.120 --> 17:03.120]  standoff that looks like something on a V for vendetta and the people climbing over
[17:03.120 --> 17:06.120]  the fence as the feds threatened to shoot them and then the feds backing off with
[17:06.120 --> 17:10.120]  their guns trained on them if you had that high death video you'd be on drudge
[17:10.120 --> 17:13.120]  I fact I wish he would have done it I wouldn't have to send my reporters out
[17:13.120 --> 17:18.120]  there and risk their lives don't you get it I'm looking for people to promote
[17:18.120 --> 17:23.120]  I'm looking for people to fight with I'm in a war my goal is to defeat the new
[17:23.120 --> 17:28.120]  world order George Soros the globalist the private fellow reserve my goal is to
[17:28.120 --> 17:33.120]  get Rand Paul or Ted Cruz or the White House my goal is to promote Ron Paul
[17:33.120 --> 17:38.120]  my goal is to defeat tyranny my goal is to have humanity survive and not blow
[17:38.120 --> 17:46.120]  the planet up my goal is to stop World War three with the Russians we're going to
[17:46.120 --> 17:49.120]  cover in the next segment and then I'm going to get into the latest developments
[17:49.120 --> 17:56.120]  out west at the bunny ranch but I see the hatred that these talk show hosts have
[17:56.120 --> 18:03.120]  for me and and and the disinfo and all of it and it just makes me know that
[18:03.120 --> 18:10.120]  they're compromised and they've been blackmailed or they're crazy or they're
[18:10.120 --> 18:16.120]  crazy because I'm telling you folks this is the time to not in fight this is
[18:16.120 --> 18:20.120]  the time to not snipe at each other and I can't believe that there's been a
[18:20.120 --> 18:26.120]  debate on whether Bundy is right or not even on conservative radio libertarian
[18:26.120 --> 18:30.120]  radio I'm going to talk about that coming up if you knew the facts and if
[18:30.120 --> 18:36.120]  people had any basic grounding they would know that that this is absolute
[18:36.120 --> 18:41.120]  essence of liberty that we're seeing out there regardless people walking up
[18:41.120 --> 18:46.120]  against feds who've been tasering and beating and police dogging women and
[18:46.120 --> 18:52.120]  and and cancer victims and folks for no reason people responded and said you
[18:52.120 --> 18:55.120]  want to fight you're going to get one and had their guns at their sides and
[18:55.120 --> 18:59.120]  marched it men pointing guns at them saying we're going to shoot you that
[18:59.120 --> 19:03.120]  was like Tiananmen Square but the Chinese government blinked that that you
[19:03.120 --> 19:10.120]  saw is what made America great that that you saw was 300 was come and take it was
[19:10.120 --> 19:15.120]  the Alamo that's what we're dealing with here and that's what scares the
[19:15.120 --> 19:19.120]  globalist because if they start a civil war and we start fighting back and
[19:19.120 --> 19:26.120]  aren't cowards we will win very quickly and Harry Reid says it's not over yet
[19:26.120 --> 19:31.120]  because he knows that if they can't intimidate us and if they let one end
[19:31.120 --> 19:34.120]  stand up they might all stand up is there anything you'd like to say about
[19:34.120 --> 19:40.120]  what's going on down south in the BLM well it's not over and we can't have
[19:40.120 --> 19:45.120]  an America people that violate the law and just walk away from it so it's not
[19:45.120 --> 19:48.120]  over yeah I want to say something to all the neocon talk show host posing
[19:48.120 --> 19:52.120]  libertarians out there I don't want a job with a new world order managing the

[25:25.120 --> 25:36.120]  yards al Qaeda in the crimson Crescent as it's known from eastern Europe right
[25:36.120 --> 25:43.120]  through the stands into central Asia all the way over to China the crimson Crescent
[25:43.120 --> 25:54.120]  is publicly publicly publicly publicly look it up funded by who the state
[25:54.120 --> 26:00.120]  department just like they funded the radicals and the George Soros groups for
[26:00.120 --> 26:08.120]  four years with five billion to overthrow Ukraine that's not debated they
[26:08.120 --> 26:11.120]  have press conferences at the state department admitting it but the public
[26:11.120 --> 26:15.120]  doesn't watch state department press conferences the public watches the
[26:15.120 --> 26:20.120]  news that goes Russia did bad things and Russia attacked Ukraine and Russia
[26:20.120 --> 26:27.120]  attacked Georgia no Russia didn't and Russia's a kleptocratic mafia run group
[26:27.120 --> 26:31.120]  of alcoholics on average in the government system but I'll tell you this
[26:31.120 --> 26:34.120]  they pay their people to have kids and they're becoming more of a Christian
[26:34.120 --> 26:39.120]  nation they've been reforming and the globalists don't want that they don't
[26:39.120 --> 26:44.120]  put cancer viruses in the vaccines in Russia they have their top TV host that
[26:44.120 --> 26:48.120]  sounds like Alex Jones whose buddies with Vladimir Putin who they put on air
[26:48.120 --> 26:54.120]  who basically will openly quotes this show on state-run media I've never been
[26:54.120 --> 26:59.120]  to Russia I don't speak Russian I don't have any Slavic blood in me why is that
[26:59.120 --> 27:03.120]  going on because I've got the truth ladies and gentlemen and the Russians
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.120]  have a decision to make what are they going to do with their people are they
[27:07.120 --> 27:10.120]  going to end Russia as we know it are they going to exterminate their
[27:10.120 --> 27:14.120]  population because they were already under globalist control for 85 years and
[27:14.120 --> 27:19.120]  they saw their population go down by 37% and they've already experienced
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.120]  activism and communism and progressivism and they don't like it are they perfect
[27:24.120 --> 27:28.120]  no they've got a lot of ghosts and a lot of problems to kick but they're
[27:28.120 --> 27:32.120]  surrounded by the new world order the same folks going after Bundy the same
[27:32.120 --> 27:36.120]  ones going after your guns the same ones going after your pension funds the same
[27:36.120 --> 27:43.120]  ones screw in Spain and France and Greece and every African country over
[27:43.120 --> 27:47.120]  and Libya the same ones trying to put al-Qaeda in charge of Syria the same
[27:47.120 --> 27:52.120]  ones that overthrew the regime and put radicals in to blow up almost all the
[27:52.120 --> 27:58.120]  churches in Egypt the ones attacking the Egyptian military and then our media
[27:58.120 --> 28:02.120]  criticizes the Egyptian military for fighting back when their military bases
[28:02.120 --> 28:09.120]  are being rocket attacked by actual al-Qaeda the public doesn't know how the
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.120]  world works that's the only reason the globalist can get away with any of this
[28:14.120 --> 28:23.120]  garbage and now they're trying to start World War 3 with the Russians and let
[28:23.120 --> 28:27.120]  me tell you what I saw in my mind's eye historically a civil war starting once
[28:27.120 --> 28:30.120]  they over through the government put in an installed a new government you'd
[28:30.120 --> 28:35.120]  have the Russians that are about 45% of the overall country 75% of the East
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.120]  they're going to end up revolting you're gonna have an ongoing civil war the
[28:39.120 --> 28:43.120]  West is gonna act like Russia caused the problem when the West run by the
[28:43.120 --> 28:48.120]  globalist caused it and then you're gonna have a proxy war and the CIA chief
[28:48.120 --> 28:51.120]  reportedly was there last week the Russians claimed and that and that he was
[28:51.120 --> 28:59.120]  ordering an offensive led by US special forces and mercenaries and our media said
[28:59.120 --> 29:03.120]  all that's ridiculous over the weekend and then what started today what's in
[29:03.120 --> 29:09.120]  Reuters a quote Ukrainian offensive into Russian held areas that's the Reuters
[29:09.120 --> 29:15.120]  headline commanded by the Central Intelligence Agency who's about as
[29:15.120 --> 29:25.120]  American as the moon about as American as a Swiss cheese Russia says Ukraine
[29:25.120 --> 29:32.120]  close to civil war as Kiev begins offensive Reuters how's that oh let's talk
[29:32.120 --> 29:37.120]  about the Malaysian plane a little bit here the globalists want a giant war
[29:37.120 --> 29:41.120]  because the derivatives are coming to and the global economies collapsing by
[29:41.120 --> 29:47.120]  design but they need a war to act like the war caused it get it big fat

[34:21.120 --> 34:24.120]  well here is the headline
[34:24.120 --> 34:29.120]  Russia says Ukraine close to civil war as Kiev begins offensive
[34:29.120 --> 34:31.120]  Reuters
[34:31.120 --> 34:35.120]  Russia declared Ukraine on the break of civil war today
[34:35.120 --> 34:40.120]  on Tuesday as the capital said an anti-terrorist operation
[34:40.120 --> 34:43.120]  anyone that you oppose in the new world order is a terrorist
[34:43.120 --> 34:46.120]  against pro-moscow separatists was underway
[34:46.120 --> 34:52.120]  with troops and armored personnel carriers seen near the flashpoint eastern town
[34:52.120 --> 34:56.120]  they've also taken an airport in a predominantly Russian area
[34:56.120 --> 34:59.120]  that was previously part of Russia
[34:59.120 --> 35:03.120]  and again these people were throwing mall off cocktails and shooting police just a few months ago
[35:03.120 --> 35:05.120]  now they're the government
[35:05.120 --> 35:07.120]  and anyone that doesn't want to be ruled by them
[35:07.120 --> 35:10.120]  well is a terrorist
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.120]  and again the issue is if this draws Russia in
[35:14.120 --> 35:19.120]  because you've got the West helping advise and fund with mercenaries these people
[35:19.120 --> 35:27.120]  the Russians if they start fighting back you're talking about a major major major flashpoint
[35:27.120 --> 35:29.120]  now continuing
[35:29.120 --> 35:33.120]  two more wounded in skirmish in eastern Ukraine that's being reported gunfire
[35:33.120 --> 35:38.120]  eastern Ukraine's airport as troops move in Ukraine is now announcing the Ukrainian government
[35:38.120 --> 35:45.120]  they have retaken that Russian separatist held area
[35:45.120 --> 35:51.120]  meanwhile Russian jet passes near US ship in Black Sea provocative says the Pentagon
[35:51.120 --> 35:57.120]  a Russian fighter jet made repeated low altitude close range passes near US warship in the Black Sea over the weekend
[35:57.120 --> 36:04.120]  the Pentagon said on Monday condemning the action at a time of heightened US Russian tensions over Ukraine
[36:04.120 --> 36:07.120]  and of course what that says is go ahead and shoot our plane down
[36:07.120 --> 36:10.120]  and because we're ready to blow your ships up
[36:10.120 --> 36:14.120]  we've got anti ship supersonic missiles aimed at you off the coast which they have
[36:14.120 --> 36:18.120]  and we want you to go ahead and kill our pilot our pilots ready to die
[36:18.120 --> 36:23.120]  and then we're gonna sink your ships right now so go ahead I mean this is what the Russians are starting to do
[36:23.120 --> 36:31.120]  just attack us first go ahead and shoot first give us the moral high ground we're going to attack you
[36:31.120 --> 36:35.120]  and again we're doing this for George Soros the new world order
[36:35.120 --> 36:39.120]  Putin's no angel but look look who's running us
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.120]  look look who didn't even live in the US most of the time look at who's got bunkers
[36:43.120 --> 36:50.120]  all these rich billionaires that literally sit around and play risk with our lives
[36:50.120 --> 36:58.120]  here's another one Russia test multi warhead ICBM MIRV ICBM flight test comes
[36:58.120 --> 37:05.120]  and then height intentions over Ukraine Russia's military carried out a flight test of a new multi war intercontinental ballistic missile on Monday
[37:05.120 --> 37:08.120]  and then growing tensions with the United States over the crisis in Ukraine
[37:08.120 --> 37:15.120]  the SS-27 mod 2 road mobile ICBM those are mobile missiles so they're hard to take out
[37:15.120 --> 37:24.120]  was launched around 240 a.m. EST from Russia's Plesetok launch facility located 500 miles north of Moscow
[37:24.120 --> 37:29.120]  the main purpose of the launch is to validate the reliability of a batch of this class of missiles
[37:29.120 --> 37:38.120]  made at the plant defense minister told state run AVN
[37:38.120 --> 37:47.120]  unspecified number of simulated nuclear warheads landed an impact range on the cura test range in the Kamchukha peninsula
[37:47.120 --> 37:56.120]  or Kamchapka I forget I pronounced that in Russia's far east 5,000 miles away the distance is 3,500 miles I was going from memory
[37:56.120 --> 38:03.120]  the S I know it's 5,000 miles from one end of Russia the other in some areas the SS-27 mod 2 is Russia's newest ICBM
[38:03.120 --> 38:08.120]  and has been touted as Russian officials as designed specifically to defeat U.S. missile defenses
[38:08.120 --> 38:17.120]  there you go it's not U.S. missile defenses it's New World Order missile defenses it's eugenics transhumanist command base
[38:17.120 --> 38:26.120]  we are seized by evil now a command base of wickedness and Russia's the main enemy the globalists don't fully control
[38:26.120 --> 38:32.120]  they're deep in bed with the Chinese murdering their people forced abortions forced and fantasied of living already born babies
[38:32.120 --> 38:43.120]  out of the womb suicide trucks suicide forced organ harvesting vans suicide nets forced drugging just just hell pits
[38:43.120 --> 38:52.120]  thousands of riots a month soylent green level societal collapse ghost cities for the elite building the real estate for themselves
[38:52.120 --> 38:58.120]  while the general population starves totally in bed with the New World Order
[38:58.120 --> 39:07.120]  Russia flailing around after 85 years of New World Order social engineering just being encircled by the globalist
[39:07.120 --> 39:19.120]  but with enough brains the technological know how to put up a defense with nuclear weapons
[39:19.120 --> 39:22.120]  and that's where we stand ladies and gentlemen

[42:44.120 --> 42:54.120]  then they break down in retrograde into into into other hormones this doesn't do that nothing in there is a hormone mimicar that's why it's revolutionary
[42:54.120 --> 43:07.120]  change steiner I've known since high school can can bench press 400 pounds 10 times I've seen him do it naturally using supplements and working out
[43:07.120 --> 43:19.120]  but he was not as strong as he was when he was 30 he's 40 same age as I am and I said look just try and tell me what I was like okay I'm sure I'm sure it's really good you know I'm sure it's okay
[43:19.120 --> 43:24.120]  he was like laughing at me he's not laughing now
[43:24.120 --> 43:28.120]  people that take it are not laughing now
[43:28.120 --> 43:31.120]  I mean it's it's powerful
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.120]  I mean last night I had a bunch of work to do and quite frankly it's you call it male vitality
[43:36.120 --> 43:39.120]  it's it's it's a natural stimulant
[43:39.120 --> 43:44.120]  but it's clarity because it's something that synergizes with your body
[43:44.120 --> 43:54.120]  and it's it's it is a aphrodisiac quite frankly that's the effect it has on me everybody else it takes it I mean it's it's something else folks
[43:54.120 --> 44:04.120]  and that's all I can tell you is that we sought around to find the most powerful concentrated formula we could the superfemale vitality is coming out
[44:04.120 --> 44:12.120]  Dr. Group said even though this is even bigger effect on women the supermaul vitality he goes we could soup it up and tweak it for women even more
[44:12.120 --> 44:17.120]  and so it's got a different formula and we'll see what happens with women around here on it
[44:17.120 --> 44:25.120]  you know fellas wives and stuff but it's gonna be coming out in about a month and a half but supermaul vitality is available right now
[44:25.120 --> 44:31.120]  the ladies like hey where's ours it is for you folks and quite frankly I don't know the new formula for women will be better
[44:31.120 --> 44:36.120]  he says it will be and maybe he's right I intend to take it see what it does to me
[44:36.120 --> 44:42.120]  but that's the bottom line that's how we find this operation that is groundbreaking on the tip of the spear
[44:42.120 --> 44:49.120]  and please support local M&F and affiliates become a local sponsor promote the shows or support the local sponsors and let folks know why you are
[44:49.120 --> 44:57.120]  and you've been doing that we're getting a lot of new affiliates first they put us on the weekend and they put us on at night and they put us on live during the day
[44:57.120 --> 45:05.120]  and it's really freaking out the mainline neocon radio industry right now and I'm just like look guys become like us and you'll get the ratings
[45:05.120 --> 45:07.120]  and you'll get the listeners tell the truth
[45:07.120 --> 45:18.120]  nothing succeeds like success I mean our Americana story of success from the ground up working with other people that were fellow travelers in liberty with us
[45:18.120 --> 45:25.120]  not fellow travelers like socialists fellow travelers in liberty people that really want to be free that's what it's all about
[45:25.120 --> 45:34.120]  and speaking of that let me tell you in a nutshell what's really happening at the Bundy Ranch
[45:34.120 --> 45:41.120]  you've got a lot of disinformation and the control corporate media preying on the public's ignorance about land
[45:41.120 --> 45:57.120]  the Bundy's have grazing rights water rights forage rights 1877 on record it's been called the Bundy Ranch in court records local news has had to admit since at least 1900
[45:57.120 --> 46:06.120]  there's no point when there's nobody around when a bunch of Mormon families 50 something families show up on wagons in 1877
[46:06.120 --> 46:15.120]  and it's not even a territory it's not even a state there's no need to call it your ranch when you're out there
[46:15.120 --> 46:25.120]  okay so let's just explain that then over time his family works for the government buys into their bull lets the BLM tell them it's their land now
[46:25.120 --> 46:30.120]  and kind of waives some of their rights his grandfather did not a lot but I've researched it
[46:30.120 --> 46:36.120]  it was after World War two and stuff the government's God you do what they say
[46:36.120 --> 46:43.120]  by the time it gets around to his dad and others they don't they don't they stop paying the range fees and go look we're not supposed to pay these
[46:43.120 --> 46:50.120]  new people coming out wanting to use land that's not being used and someone doesn't have a claim to then you pay the range fees
[46:50.120 --> 46:57.120]  so you can have guys in brand new trucks and military outfits pointing guns at you and harassing people and shooting teenagers on bicycles
[46:57.120 --> 47:02.120]  because they don't stop no I mean you drive around the desert now out west it's just cops everywhere pointing guns at you
[47:02.120 --> 47:09.120]  who think they're Rambo I mean it's like living in Iraq or something that's the new America so that's what this is all about
[47:09.120 --> 47:17.120]  and it's about tasers and police dogs and helicopters and free speech zones saying anybody coming out here to protest in an entire county
[47:17.120 --> 47:23.120]  if you get out of two little red pins we're gonna taser you and throw you the ground and take you to jail and shove your head in the ground
[47:23.120 --> 47:32.120]  and break your nose and bloody your eye that's Tiananmen's square style garbage right there so they try to make it about the cows
[47:32.120 --> 47:37.120]  and his Bundy writer is Bundy wrong there are a bunch of lawyers the globalist are a bunch of lawyers they sit back and they go
[47:37.120 --> 47:44.120]  how do we distract people when we make it about the minutiae of the cows and we make it all about he's a freeloader not paying his fair share
[47:44.120 --> 47:50.120]  that's how they always get taxes raised well Google everybody or tax exempt and you know all these big senators
[47:50.120 --> 47:54.120]  I mean most of them don't even pay taxes it comes out they're there telling you Bundy didn't pay his fair share
[47:54.120 --> 48:03.120]  yeah out in the wasteland desert producing beef for America since 1877 yeah he's a lazy piece of garbage Harry Reid
[48:03.120 --> 48:12.120]  okay so you have this dichotomy of Harry Reid this piece of garbage and you've got you know the Bundys
[48:12.120 --> 48:21.120]  and you know if I was an LDS or out there I mean you know it's time for the quote LDS to run out all of these people
[48:21.120 --> 48:28.120]  that are that are sitting atop their organization because I'll tell you I'm the Mormons are on the street of the nicest people
[48:28.120 --> 48:32.120]  ever and hard working and totally trustworthy people and then you see a bunch of the Mormon leadership
[48:32.120 --> 48:39.120]  I'm not trying to get off into this you see Glenn Beck out there attacking Bundy and until his audience backlashed on him it's like man
[48:39.120 --> 48:46.120]  boy this is this is this is this is quite a paradox well it's just like America's full of good people but it's run by Crooks
[48:46.120 --> 48:54.120]  it's the same thing bad people continue to get into control of every organization every system and Harry Reid is a gangster
[48:54.120 --> 49:04.120]  and a thug and a piece of trash and so the next big issue is it's civil disobedience even if he didn't have the original claim on that property
[49:04.120 --> 49:10.120]  which he did the image of people walking up against men with guns saying we're going to shoot you if you come across that line
[49:10.120 --> 49:17.120]  and still doing it and the paramilitary thugs backing off is total victory and is the spirit of honor and courage
[49:17.120 --> 49:24.120]  and no one should criticize that you should only honor and respect everyone that was there including my reporters
[49:24.120 --> 49:34.120]  you understand that you understand that all you neocons out there attacking us nationally and George Soros group attacking us all the rest of it
[49:34.120 --> 49:49.120]  you people are scum now expanding on that then there's the new lie that oh no no no the solar farm was 200 miles away knowing you're ignorant
[49:49.120 --> 49:59.120]  there's a string of them for 100 miles or so and then 130 miles up and Bundy's land in the BLM documents at infowars.com
[49:59.120 --> 50:08.120]  they say for this project we've already gotten the other families off of all the other land in the area the last one's Bundy we got to remove him
[50:08.120 --> 50:15.120]  and that's from last year on the BLM website they took it down it was on the Google archive guess what was removed
[50:15.120 --> 50:24.120]  and we know about this was we've you have to threaten a lawsuit to have that taken down you they had to pull big strings to have that taken down
[50:24.120 --> 50:39.120]  and the articles up on infowars.com feds desperate to hide Harry Reid link to Bundy land grab and we have the video of it she because they just want to say there's no drones
[50:39.120 --> 50:47.120]  there's no checkpoints there's no new world order there's no tyranny governments not out of control governments completely out of control
[50:47.120 --> 50:55.120]  they're usurping us they're involved in civil disobedience to the Constitution they're overrunning us it's time to start pushing back
[50:55.120 --> 51:00.120]  and that's why Bundy and the rest of them are heroes and a bunch of cowards sit on the sidelines
[51:00.120 --> 51:11.120]  attention gun owners it's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack but is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense

[53:22.120 --> 53:26.120]  on average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week

[54:01.120 --> 54:07.120]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[54:07.120 --> 54:11.120]  because there's a war on for your mind
[54:19.120 --> 54:22.120]  when people get pushed to the edge they break
[54:22.120 --> 54:26.120]  and the globalists intend to push America to the edge that's why they have the armored vehicles
[54:26.120 --> 54:29.120]  the training for martial law
[54:29.120 --> 54:35.120]  that's why they're demonizing the opposition which is rural Christian communities that they know
[54:35.120 --> 54:40.120]  are not going to give in to a gen of 21
[54:40.120 --> 54:47.120]  we have the BLM documents and Scribb.org and all the other document sites also save them
[54:47.120 --> 54:52.120]  once we pointed this out last Friday and it became the number one news story on the internet
[54:52.120 --> 54:57.120]  throughout the weekend according to all the aggregate sites because drudgereport.com carried it
[54:57.120 --> 55:02.120]  Harry Reid breaking Senator Harry Reid behind BLM Landgrab of Bundy Ranch
[55:02.120 --> 55:07.120]  he's the one heading it up his former chief of staff head advisor is the head of the BLM
[55:07.120 --> 55:11.120]  his family's involved in the energy deal
[55:11.120 --> 55:16.120]  and their answer to this credit me on MSNBC media matters and
[55:16.120 --> 55:20.120]  in supposed conservative radio circles
[55:20.120 --> 55:24.120]  very shameful
[55:24.120 --> 55:29.120]  is to say oh the energy deal fell through last year no it didn't
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.120]  they've got a new deal and to say that his ranch was never listed
[55:34.120 --> 55:37.120]  it's in the stupid documents
[55:37.120 --> 55:45.120]  I mean this is the level of garbage why doesn't the Republican leadership want to make an issue out of this
[55:45.120 --> 55:51.120]  why doesn't the Republican leadership want to make an issue out of this
[55:51.120 --> 55:55.120]  because they're involved in a bunch of land scams and bad deals see
[55:55.120 --> 56:00.120]  this is the thing about corruption when you start giving into it because you don't want to have your stuff looked at
[56:00.120 --> 56:06.120]  the whole thing rots and then the worst of the system becomes the new standard
[56:06.120 --> 56:11.120]  and society collapses but Harry Reid was asked about it yesterday by local Las Vegas TV
[56:11.120 --> 56:16.120]  and he very smugly sits there your radio listener I wish you could see his face
[56:16.120 --> 56:19.120]  it's up on infowords.com and drudgereport.com has it as well
[56:19.120 --> 56:27.120]  he says it's not over yet and the evil satisfied smile on his face is so disgusting
[56:27.120 --> 56:31.120]  hey we know it's not over yet Reid let's play that clip
[56:31.120 --> 56:35.120]  is there anything you'd like to say about what's going on down south in Clive Bundy and the BLM
[56:35.120 --> 56:42.120]  well it's not over and we can't have an American people that violate the law and just walk away from it
[56:42.120 --> 56:44.120]  so it's not over
[56:44.120 --> 56:50.120]  that from the democrats, that from the kingpin of the senate, that from one of the most corrupt people I could think of
[56:50.120 --> 56:56.120]  while there's all this lawless NSA spying, salindra, he's involved in all this stuff, campaign corruption
[56:56.120 --> 56:59.120]  and he's like we can't have the American people, that's right
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.120]  we gotta follow your laws of tyranny
[57:01.120 --> 57:03.120]  well what happens when the government breaks all the laws
[57:03.120 --> 57:05.120]  what happens when the government's a tyranny
[57:05.120 --> 57:10.120]  it becomes duty to not follow your regulations where you claim he doesn't have grazing rights
[57:10.120 --> 57:14.120]  when he does under all the previous precedents
[57:14.120 --> 57:18.120]  what are you gonna do folks as government says it's the law, your kids gotta take shots
[57:18.120 --> 57:23.120]  or it's the law, Catholic churches have to hire, you know, Satanist
[57:23.120 --> 57:24.120]  I mean that's all happening right now
[57:24.120 --> 57:26.120]  it's the law you have no rights
[57:26.120 --> 57:28.120]  it's the law your kids belong to the state
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.120]  no it's not
[57:30.120 --> 57:33.120]  you got all your tin badges and all your fake courts now
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.120]  people understand in their gut what justice is
[57:36.120 --> 57:41.120]  and we're not gonna follow a bunch of unconstitutional lawless trash
[57:41.120 --> 57:47.120]  and I can't believe the cowards out there in neocon radio
[57:47.120 --> 57:50.120]  who are attacking the bundies and saying pay your taxes
[57:50.120 --> 57:52.120]  pay your taxes
[57:52.120 --> 57:56.120]  it's all the big rich people lobbying for hire taxes on poor people
[57:56.120 --> 58:01.120]  that's what Obamacare is, 20 new taxes, 7 of them on poor people
[58:01.120 --> 58:06.120]  here's Ron Paul that's up on infowars.com saying he's concerned about a new Waco
[58:06.120 --> 58:08.120]  and I am too, here it is
[58:08.120 --> 58:10.120]  well I guess you can go either two ways
[58:10.120 --> 58:14.120]  I'm hoping this is a very positive of things to come where the people stand up
[58:14.120 --> 58:18.120]  and object to the several governments intrusion into our lives and everything that we do
[58:18.120 --> 58:22.120]  and when the people do get together and stand up
[58:22.120 --> 58:25.120]  I think governments will be forced to back down
[58:25.120 --> 58:29.120]  but the other thing is is governments don't give up their power easily
[58:29.120 --> 58:34.120]  and they will come back with a lot more force like they did at Waco
[58:34.120 --> 58:37.120]  with the Davidians so I don't know which way is going
[58:37.120 --> 58:40.120]  we'll be right back folks stay with us
[58:40.120 --> 58:44.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN

[58:50.120 --> 58:54.120]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda
[58:54.120 --> 58:57.120]  they are manipulating our genetics
[58:57.120 --> 59:00.120]  they are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers
[59:00.120 --> 59:05.120]  that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs

[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.120]  From Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.120]  Clive and Bundy is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment with updates
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.120]  on what could be the start of the New Brush Fire Rebellions
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.120]  This time of 1776 started out in the Nevada desert
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.120]  I hope it's a cultural revolution against their cultural revolution
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.120]  I hope we can win the hearts and minds of the enforcers which I know we are
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120]  I'm not enemies of the BLM
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:58.120]  but seeing them taser people and attack women from behind
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.120]  I'm just glad I'm not dishonorable like that
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.120]  The system wants an imperious attitude against the public
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:10.120]  so that we'll shut up and let them do whatever they want
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:15.120]  Joe Scarborough has come out and said that Bundy should just obey the law
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.120]  that's the George Soros line, that's the Media Matters line
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.120]  that's the other big radio conservative talk shows line
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:29.120]  you see it's their job as Republican hacks
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.120]  to keep everybody on the plantation
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.120]  to act like they're for property rights, to act like they're for freedom
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.120]  to act like they're revolutionaries for liberty
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.120]  brought in truth ladies and gentlemen
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.120]  they're just there playing the part of the opposition
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.120]  and as soon as Republicans get back in office
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.120]  they have every intention you can bet your bottom dollar
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.120]  of accelerating the police state takeover
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.120]  and then the Democrats will suddenly start criticizing the NSA
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.120]  and torture and secret arrest, it's a joke
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.120]  we need to take over the Republican Party with real libertarians
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.120]  that's what the whole power structure is scared of
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.120]  because they've identified an avenue that's our best shot
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.120]  of taking the country back
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.120]  the Republican platform at the state level
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.120]  in places like Texas is very good
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.120]  the problem is the Republican Party of Texas
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:24.120]  is run by people like David Dewhurst and Rick Perry
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:29.120]  that talk the talk big time but don't walk the walk
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.120]  and it's disgusting
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.120]  now a lot of different clips, we've got the Bundy's coming up
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.120]  do we happen to have Scarborough where he says a bye by the law?
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.120]  I know Kurt Nemo wrote an article up at infowars.com
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.120]  that wasn't affirmative, we have that?
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.120]  okay great thank you
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.120]  but here's another headline up on infowars.com
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.120]  feds desperate to hide Harry Reid link to Bundy Landgrab
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.120]  that's a big deal
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.120]  and Paul Watson has done a special video report on that
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.120]  but also he's going to be writing an article in and around it
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.120]  the feds are so desperate to hide Harry Reid's connection
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.120]  to the communist Chinese energy company
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.120]  linked to the Clive and Bundy Landgrab
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.120]  they are now even deleting Google's cash version
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.120]  of the explosive document originally deleted from the BLM website
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.120]  and then we have the number one story on the internet
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.120]  Friday night, Saturday and Sunday
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.120]  number one you can go to our articles
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:36.120]  where it links to the big aggregate sites that track it
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.120]  and Google said it was number one story
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.120]  the other site's number one, Alexa number one story
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.120]  in the world, in the world
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.120]  in the world was Harry Reid
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.120]  and so now we learn who's who
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.120]  we see the so-called conservative talk show host running around
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.120]  saying this isn't true
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.120]  protecting Harry Reid
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.120]  because it's a big deal, you know, the Chinese can't buy up Hollywood
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.120]  the communist and if they can't buy up the oil fields
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.120]  and if they can't buy up the...
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.120]  and by the way, if they wanted to come pay for your private property
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120]  that's fine
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.120]  but no, they go and kick farmers and ranchers off land
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.120]  that they have the grazing rights to
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.120]  and then they just, you know, make a little investment here
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.120]  and hire a few people's kids that happen to be in the U.S. Senate
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.120]  and then they get to have the property
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.120]  and get a nice cut of the energy deal
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120]  whether it ever even gets built
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.120]  they use government energy funds to build it
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.120]  hell, just have an office building
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.120]  like some of these energy companies
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.120]  or they just have an office building
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.120]  and there's nobody in it
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.120]  like Cylindra and you get $500 million
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.120]  I guess Cylindra didn't happen, huh?
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120]  either
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.120]  other conspiracy theory, I remember drugs they said
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120]  was a conspiracy theory, there's a $5,000 fine this year
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.120]  you don't get Obamacare if you own a business
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.120]  of course that's in the bill but
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.120]  that matter, Matt Drudge is a conspiracy theorist too
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.120]  why does the United States
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.120]  spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.120]  why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.120]  the highest rates of diabetes, autism
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.120]  and every other major disease
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.120]  it all comes down to one thing
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.120]  we are what we eat
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.120]  our food is devoid of nutrition
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.120]  and processed with poisons and additives
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.120]  our water is filled with toxic poisons
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.120]  and big pharma runoff
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.120]  all of this has been engineered by design
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.120]  we can turn the tide against the eugenicist
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:35.120]  by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs

[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.120]  had their drinking water contaminated
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.120]  what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.120]  it's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents

[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.120]  on average the county says it sprays with glyphosate
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.120]  at least once a week
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.120]  few filters cut out the glyphosates
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.120]  that is found in water supplies worldwide
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.120]  remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines

[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.120]  deep behind enemy lines
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.120]  the information war continues
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.120]  it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.120]  you know I had a great private conversation with Ron Paul yesterday
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120]  a lengthy one
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.120]  and he's just doing a lot of great exciting things
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.120]  it was a private conversation but down the road I'm sure folks will hear
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.120]  but just so many interesting things going on
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:36.120]  Liberty is certainly on the march on a planetary level
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.120]  but there's going to be pushback against that
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.120]  you know today we pay our tax money
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.120]  the private run-for-profit fellow reserves collection agency
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:47.120]  the IRS that wasn't set up till 1913
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.120]  and then on average Americans didn't pay me income tax until World War II
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.120]  they called it a war tax
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.120]  and then in 51 they made it permanent
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.120]  just like we didn't have property taxes in this country the last 100 years
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.120]  and it wasn't universal until about 30 years ago
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:06.120]  you don't own your land folks if you pay a property tax
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.120]  it's not really your land you pay a rent
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.120]  Clive Bundy and seven generations of his family since the 1870s
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:18.120]  have the surface foraging water rights
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.120]  and for those that don't know this is universal across Europe, England and the US
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.120]  it's common law certified by state and federal law
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.120]  that if you were the first in a territory or area and you use the water
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:36.120]  and the range you have the claim on the land
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:41.120]  now they've used ignorance to distract the public
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.120]  and say Bundy's not paying his taxes he's lazy
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.120]  if you're an illegal coming and having an anchor baby
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.120]  or your corporation getting corporate welfare like Solyndra
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.120]  that's fine
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.120]  or if you're Microsoft you know paying zero tax or whatever that's okay
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.120]  but if you're Clive Bundy producing beef for this country
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.120]  you're a low-down lazy free-loading piece of garbage
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:06.120]  according to neocon radio and MSNBC and CNN
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.120]  and media matters that the lighthouse runs
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:15.120]  and then they went further we last week got the BLM documents from the Google cash
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:21.120]  they taken them off the BLM site where they said Clive Bundy is a recharge zone area
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.120]  set aside where we're going to use this area for the solar panels next door
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:29.120]  we got to use him for the power lines and we got to use him as a set aside
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.120]  under international UNESCO rules where you can't use the property
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.120]  that's how they do it they have a quote carbon sink as they call it
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.120]  that's the global treaty
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:42.120]  then if they're going to use this well your land can't be used
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.120]  it's nature conservancy stuff and we're showing the documents on screen right now
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  they've since pulled it off Google they're so upset and they've got read running around
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:55.120]  with people running defense for him saying this doesn't exist
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.120]  they're in a lot of trouble folks
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:03.120]  now we've got him to the bottom of the hour maybe longer I want to go to him now to cover the waterfront
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.120]  and to discuss everything that's unfolding but I wanted to play Harry Reid
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:14.120]  saying it's not over yet yesterday with the most disgusting you know what eating grin
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.120]  the true grin of a psychopath kleptocrat
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.120]  I mean it just says a trillion words
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.120]  the smugness of thinking he's untouchable and he's invincible
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:32.120]  all the horrible things the gun grabbing the open borders the attacks on families
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:37.120]  this guy and I'm no I'm you know I'm not in the LDS so I don't want to speak for folks
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.120]  but the Mormons I know are all upstanding really hard working good people
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.120]  the front lines of fighting the new order
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.120]  I want to know why Harry Reid's at the forefront of destroying this country in the world
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.120]  I want to ask why he hasn't been thrown out of his church
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.120]  maybe that's not my business but let me throw that at you Clyde Bundy
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.120]  what's your take on on this man I wouldn't call him a Christian
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.120]  I wouldn't call him anything but a but a scallywag
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:05.120]  well I can tell you one thing the people of state of Nevada
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:11.120]  they elected the United States Senate to take care of business
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:17.120]  like things like fighting foreign wars and doing business with other countries
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.120]  they didn't elect him to come back to Nevada and have anything to do with this public land
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:26.120]  of Clark County Nevada so this is not none of his business
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:29.120]  he has no jurisdiction authority we didn't elect him to be here
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.120]  we haven't asked him to be here
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.120]  Harry get your back where you're supposed to be and do what you're supposed to be doing
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.120]  if you had Harry Reid in front of you right now what would you say to him
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.120]  he definitely watches and listens to this show
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.120]  I was telling the exact same thing I just told you
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:51.120]  I did tell Harry right now that's where we never elected him to come down here and bring his army
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:59.120]  and against we the people we never did do that and we're not going to accept that one more time ever
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.120]  well you're definitely a ghost of our forefathers that's exactly how they talked
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.120]  and it's so alien now for a lot of city slickers to hear somebody saying I won't back down
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.120]  I want to play this clip of Harry Reid
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:14.120]  is there anything you would like to say about what's going on down south of Clive Bundy in the BLM
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:21.120]  well it's not over we can't have an America people that violate the law and just walk away from it
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.120]  so it's not over
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:29.120]  unbelievable you know I think it's violating the law to taser people for no reason for free speech
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.120]  or to body slam women from behind or set dogs on people or to point guns at everybody saying
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:39.120]  we will shoot if you cross the line sir we have the audio we played the video it's a viral video
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.120]  you were there with David Knight my reporter and Josh Owens the cameraman
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:50.120]  around a thousand people so historical look like Chalcescu's Romania when the people turned on him
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.120]  or the fall of Berlin Wall or if Tiananmen Square would have gone better describe what it was like
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.120]  when you decided to say hey we're going in to get the cattle we're going over their line
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:06.120]  and you know just like Lexington say and we're not going to fire the shot heard around the world
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:10.120]  but if they fire we'll fire all the rest what was that like Mr. Bundy
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:16.120]  well you gotta sort of realize that for people with setting know the setting
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:22.120]  we had the Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie standing right beside me
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:30.120]  and he had made a statement and been negotiating with the enemy the BLM
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.120]  and come there to give we the people a statement and the people didn't accept his statement
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:43.120]  so the people give him a mandate to disarm those people over in that compound the BLM
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:51.120]  those militants that were armed over there had been tormented for several weeks
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:56.120]  he said go to disarm or the people said Sheriff go take their guns away
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:01.120]  and we give the Sheriff one hour to do that and he didn't do that
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.120]  and we give him another 15 minutes and he didn't do that
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.120]  and we give him another five minutes and he didn't do that
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:14.120]  and we had asked the media to bring this information back tell us what the Sheriff is doing
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:18.120]  and what is the Sheriff taking those arms back
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.120]  and we asked that he bring take those arms back
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.120]  which is about three miles away well about five miles away from where we were
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.120]  and bring those arms and put them under the flags where we were all congregated
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:36.120]  they didn't do that they did not do that the media did not give us a report
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:43.120]  we had a thousand people there and 50, 60 horses up on the hill
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.120]  and nothing was said about the cattle
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:51.120]  this whole thing was not about cattle
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.120]  it was about the people's rights and their liberty and their freedom
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:01.120]  and it was mad about the First Amendment rights only in these little things
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.120]  I understand the cattle were basically like taking the flag back
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:09.120]  and the cattle hadn't been talked about all day
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.120]  and then people started to say what about the cattle
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.120]  and it was ready to go
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.120]  so I said go get them
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.120]  and what I said go get them
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:24.120]  it was those horses running off the hills on the flags
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.120]  and the people got in like 300 cars
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.120]  you look like a John Wayne movie meets Veefer Vendetta
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.120]  I got to say I literally was in ecstasy
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.120]  because I was so worried about everybody getting shot in a war breaking out
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.120]  and when the feds backed off I got really happy
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.120]  and I want to be friends with those feds
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.120]  and I want them to become Americans again
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.120]  and I think they did when they stood down
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.120]  I think sanity prevailed
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.120]  and I know they felt bad having to retreat
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.120]  but Americans have been retreating in the face of the globalists
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.120]  for so long we've been retreating
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.120]  we're tired of getting pissed on
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120]  we're not going to do it no more
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.120]  and those people were ready
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.120]  and I guess I have to take the blame or the credit
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.120]  however you want to do I did say go do it
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.120]  and we didn't order them to do it
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.120]  each individual had made that decision
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.120]  and some stayed
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.120]  I feel sorry for the ones that didn't go
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.120]  but the ones that did went and faced those
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.120]  that army with guns
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.120]  and they went right up to their face
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.120]  and they could get shot any second
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:30.120]  and they went up there and they forced the United States government
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.120]  to get the hell out of our state
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.120]  and they did they left in a hurry
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.120]  well if what you've done is
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.120]  go ahead
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.120]  one thing that didn't get done
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.120]  the sheriff still didn't do his job
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.120]  he still has a job to do
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.120]  he should have took those guns as those guys run
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.120]  but they didn't
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.120]  well I want to talk about that now because
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.120]  it's so alien to people to hear you say
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120]  we don't want these armed BLM
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.120]  it'd be one thing if they had a few armed police BLM
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.120]  for any type of crisis or problems that happened
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.120]  and if they behave like police
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.120]  but when they're in military outfits
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.120]  and those guys are clearly military people
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.120]  a lot of them look like mercenaries
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.120]  they don't look like BLM
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.120]  they look like real special forces operators
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.120]  I know them when I see them on both sides
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.120]  and when you see that
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.120]  and that they're ready to kill people
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.120]  fresh back from Afghanistan
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.120]  just 10 years ago
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.120]  no one would put up with roving paramilitary federal police
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:35.120]  more of them than there are people
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.120]  that bicyclists nearby that didn't stop
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.120]  and they shot them in the back a few weeks ago
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.120]  and the aggressiveness of them
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.120]  absolutely I mean we don't want roving federal goons
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.120]  if the Austin Police Department acted like these people
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:52.120]  I'd say disband the Austin Police Department
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.120]  let me talk a little constitution here
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:00.120]  we the people have elected our county sheriff
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.120]  and we give him part of our sovereignty
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:07.120]  to take care of some legal things
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.120]  and what he's supposed to take care of
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.120]  is he's supposed to take care of our life, liberty and property
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.120]  now that authority has never been given
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.120]  to any of those federal officers
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.120]  if there's a problem
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.120]  say down on the part
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.120]  if there's a problem
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.120]  they need to call the county sheriff
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.120]  and let them come and take care of it
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.120]  they don't need to think they can take care of it
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.120]  they're working as like a guest
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:37.120]  they're like a boys count
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.120]  they're supposed to be helping people
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.120]  serving people
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.120]  and being there for people
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.120]  not to be carrying their guns and being in this great authority
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.120]  if there's a need
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.120]  every county in the United States
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.120]  they're like 3100 of them
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.120]  every county has a county sheriff
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.120]  and that's why we elected him
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.120]  to take care of those problems
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.120]  I'm just so pro-gun
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.120]  unless they totally disband the BLM
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.120]  out west it's dangerous
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.120]  you need guns
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.120]  do you think the park rangers should be able to have guns then?
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.120]  no
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.120]  why do they need guns?
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.120]  I don't need a gun on my ranch
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.120]  I go over all of the areas
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.120]  I play the park rangers
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.120]  I've never needed a gun in my whole life
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.120]  neither has any of my cowboys
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.120]  if we needed a gun we'd call the county sheriff
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.120]  say hey we need some help out here
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.120]  that's what the park rangers should do
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.120]  and that's what the BLM should do
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.120]  and that's what the station wildlife should do
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:38.120]  and that's what the FBI should do
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.120]  they don't have no resting power or anything
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.120]  if they have a problem
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.120]  call the sheriff and have him take care of their problem
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.120]  help them with them
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.120]  they're there to serve
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.120]  only to serve we the people
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.120]  not to shoot us
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.120]  well I know this
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.120]  they claim that BLM only has 200 armed officers total
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.120]  there's a major arms race in the federal government
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.120]  and I looked at those guys they brought in
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:05.120]  and I happen to know they use US military on the border
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.120]  in regular clothes because I've got family that
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:10.120]  has run operations on the border and in Mexico
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.120]  and I'll guarantee you
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.120]  most those so-called BLM guys that were out there
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.120]  were not even BLM
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.120]  they were probably joint task force 6 or 7
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.120]  out of Texas
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:25.120]  if I had to guess those were US Army
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.120]  if that is the case what do you say to that
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.120]  that sounds pretty treasonous to me
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:33.120]  well I don't see much difference in the BLM
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.120]  than the United States Army coming after
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.120]  we the people of America
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.120]  and we the people of the state of Nevada
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:43.120]  paramilitaries paramilitary
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.120]  I know that both of us
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.120]  against the Constitution in the United States
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.120]  one sense is any United States
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.120]  any United States bureaucracy have the right
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.120]  to come against we the people or have arms
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.120]  I don't see anything like that
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.120]  they can carry arms as individuals
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.120]  but when they're in their uniform
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.120]  and at their job they should not have a gun with them
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:09.120]  only person with a uniform and a job
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.120]  would be our county sheriffs and their deputies
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.120]  they're the only people that should be carrying guns
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.120]  here in America everybody else in America
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.120]  should carry a gun as a person
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.120]  that's their first or second amendment right
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.120]  they should be able to carry a gun
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:29.120]  but not as an official servant
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.120]  of we the people
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.120]  except the sheriff
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.120]  well I hear you the way they act
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.120]  they just really acted like they hated
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.120]  in those videos of tasering people and attacking
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.120]  they acted like they really hated peaceful demonstrators
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:45.120]  they look like they wanted a war
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.120]  I don't know if they individually hate us
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.120]  but they sure was standing there
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.120]  and you know I feel sorry for those people
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.120]  they're souls I mean gee with
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.120]  you come against your own people
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.120]  we the people and you threaten to shoot them
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.120]  and I mean it come within a hour
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.120]  of being somebody pulling the trigger
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:09.120]  now you got to remember we the people was not armed
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.120]  it was only the federal officers that was armed
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.120]  or whatever you want to call them
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.120]  they were armed with heavy armor
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.120]  that's right most the people did not have firearms
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.120]  that walked up to the line
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.120]  that there were some militia people there that stayed up
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.120]  mainly on the embankment were aiming down
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.120]  it was a very tense situation
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.120]  our reporters clearly heard it
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:31.120]  you can hear it it's hard on radio to pick it up on AM
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.120]  but on the video that's gone viral
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.120]  of the feds retreating
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.120]  you can hear them saying you know back up back up
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.120]  you know you know we will shoot
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:43.120]  did you audibly yourself hear them say we will shoot
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.120]  you know I wasn't there
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.120]  I didn't personally hear that
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.120]  and I only seen little clips on video
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.120]  my wife and I stayed on that stage
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.120]  where we talked and
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.120]  under the flags we stayed there
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.120]  through this whole operation
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.120]  and so we just started watching
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.120]  for the flag to come over the hill
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.120]  and we knew somebody was successful
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.120]  all the time we were there
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:13.120]  we had an airplane that was flying in a circle
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.120]  around the encampment
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.120]  and we could see that airplane
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.120]  I saw some of your sons and daughters leading it
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.120]  and you know telling them no we're not backing down
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.120]  and then cutting up in the gate
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.120]  which one of your sons was that that did that
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:29.120]  you know I had about three or four sons there
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:32.120]  and some daughters I had some sisters there
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:35.120]  and you know there was like a thousand people there
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.120]  a lot of those people on the horses were
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.120]  you know cowboys neighbors and friends
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:44.120]  and I had a family and friends there
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.120]  but there was many many more people I didn't have no
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.120]  but I'll tell you one thing
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.120]  I shook hands with most every person there
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.120]  and I hugged their women
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:58.120]  and them people were good people
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.120]  and one thing I understand
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.120]  the souls of American people
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:05.120]  and I think it's all around the world
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.120]  there's a lot of good people
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.120]  in fact every soul is good
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.120]  and I you know I realize that we need our
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.120]  individual rights to exercise agency
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:20.120]  that's what I think our Constitution give us
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.120]  absolutely you got to have free will
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.120]  you're not even conscious
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.120]  you're not even a person you got to have
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.120]  private property and privacy to do that
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.120]  now what about Ron Paul and others
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.120]  there's been talk about you know Harry Reid
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.120]  saying we're not done yet we played that clip earlier
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.120]  Ron Paul had this to say
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.120]  I want to get Clive Bundy's take on it
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.120]  this is Ron Paul with Neil Cavuto last night
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.120]  well I guess you can go either two ways
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.120]  I'm hoping this is very positive
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.120]  of things to come where the people stand up
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:47.120]  and object to the federal government's intrusion
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.120]  into our lives and everything that we do
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.120]  and when the people do get together
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.120]  and stand up I think
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.120]  governments will be forced to back down
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.120]  but the other thing is
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.120]  governments don't give up their power easily
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.120]  and they may well come back with a lot more force
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.120]  like they did at Waco with the Davidians
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.120]  so I don't know which way is going
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.120]  but so far so good
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.120]  I was delighted that they got through those couple days
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.120]  and there wasn't any shooting and no killing
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.120]  because I really encourage
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.120]  you know the demonstration against
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.120]  unfairness by our government
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.120]  but I'd like to see it all nonviolent
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.120]  and that weekend turned out so far
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.120]  to be a good step
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.120]  but people are very angry to your point congressman
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.120]  you hope it never comes to violence
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.120]  and then Judge DePaulitano breaks down
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.120]  that you shouldn't have federal courts
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:39.120]  ruling over federal land disputes
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:42.120]  and that it should be a state court that does that
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.120]  I think that's a good point that
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.120]  Judge Andrew DePaulitano makes
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.120]  Mr. Bundy
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.120]  well you know
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.120]  for Ron Paul if he was our president
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.120]  of the United States
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.120]  I don't believe this would ever happen
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.120]  but he would have fought this war for us
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.120]  before this time
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:04.120]  and so I understand Ron Paul's place
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:08.120]  and I wish we wouldn't have to fight this war
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.120]  but we do have to fight this war
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.120]  and we are ready
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.120]  and we're ready to do it, we're willing
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:17.120]  and we're actually excited about it
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.120]  it's something that
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.120]  when have we ever had this opportunity
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.120]  to fight for freedom like this
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.120]  and those people that stood in that line
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.120]  which I wasn't in that line
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.120]  but those that stood in that line
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.120]  you know their souls was on the line
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.120]  their lives are on the line
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:35.120]  and their dedication to the freedom
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.120]  and this land was definitely short
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.120]  demonstrated there
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.120]  David Knight told me he's never experienced anything like it in his life
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.120]  same thing Josh Owens
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.120]  it is really putting yourself on the line
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.120]  for true human freedom
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.120]  that opens up your heart, opens up your soul
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.120]  it's what makes you more alive
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.120]  and you cross those barriers
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.120]  every time I've risked my life
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.120]  covering a story or dealing with death threats
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.120]  or any of it, every time I just commit
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.120]  and go through the fear
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.120]  the world opens up, discernment opens up
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.120]  you're right when you say it's spiritual clive
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.120]  it is
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.120]  it definitely has to be a spiritual thing
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.120]  many people, well not that many
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.120]  but all people and I think all people
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.120]  across this world
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.120]  are getting the opportunity
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.120]  with this modern media
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.120]  we have all this technology
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.120]  we have, they're getting the opportunity
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.120]  to feel this
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.120]  and I think that they will respond positively
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.120]  does your gut tell you
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.120]  that the feds are coming back after you
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.120]  I mean obviously they'll come back
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.120]  legally at you but
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:37.120]  what does your gut tell you
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.120]  have you seen the video of him smiling
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.120]  with that demonic smile
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.120]  no, but well I did too
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.120]  I actually seen that somebody
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.120]  made a video in here
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.120]  but no
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.120]  I'm not afraid, I've got right here
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.120]  in my hand just to hear from
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.120]  I don't know what to say about
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.120]  four or five certified letters from
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.120]  the government so I'm sure their lawyers
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.120]  have been excited
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.120]  I haven't even opened them
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.120]  so yeah, no I don't think
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.120]  they're going to come out for a suit
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.120]  I think we the public are going to rally
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:11.120]  and continue on
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.120]  pushing forth
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.120]  to de-harm these people
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.120]  encouraging our county sheriffs
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.120]  to de-harm
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.120]  the United States
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.120]  bureaucracies and there's a lot of bureaucracies
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:25.120]  not just PLM and parks
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.120]  I want to do five more minutes with the other side
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.120]  then we'll let you go to talk specifically
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.120]  constitutionally about the role of the sheriff
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.120]  that Sheriff Mack talks about so much
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.120]  and other key points so we'll put some bookends
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.120]  on this straight ahead with
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.120]  Cliven Bundy
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.120]  the patriarch of what is
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:43.120]  probably going to become known
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.120]  as the flashpoint of the next American Revolution
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.120]  my gut tells me this is very important
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.120]  just what happened
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.120]  we'll be right back, stay with us
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.120]  we're on the march, the empire's on the run
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.120]  Alex Jones
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.120]  and the GCN Radio Network
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.120]  the globalists have controlled
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.120]  the mainstream media for a long time
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.120]  but now they're expanding
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.120]  making the weaponization even more vicious
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.120]  and deceptive all the major networks
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.120]  are state run
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.120]  this year with the NFL
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.120]  the NFL has become a political weapon against
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.120]  the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.120]  MSNBC tells us that
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.120]  our children belong to the state
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:25.120]  we have to break through our kind of private idea
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.120]  that kids belong to their parents
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.120]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.120]  to whole communities
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.120]  it is more important than ever to realize
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.120]  that we are not the alternative media
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.120]  we are the true media
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.120]  the establishment dinosaur press is dying
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.120]  we are in an information war
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.120]  we are losing that war
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.120]  it's been a decade

[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.120]  in the last 50 years
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.120]  iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.120]  and replaced with the halogen
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:09.120]  bromine
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.120]  this now banned in nations around the world
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.120]  guess what else is in the halogen family

[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.120]  did the right thing
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:23.120]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.120]  it's the good halogen
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.120]  on the periodic table
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.120]  and the results are on record

[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.120]  and Tiananmen Square
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.120]  happened in fact I saw a graphic
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.120]  in one of Watson's articles on info wars today
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.120]  I want to show that shows
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.120]  what I described already last week
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.120]  Saturday when it happened
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.120]  was like the tanks of Obama
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.120]  the tanks of the UN
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.120]  driving up and you got a cowboy in front of it
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.120]  in fact I want our graphics department to make one
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.120]  where it's the Tiananmen Square photo
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:49.120]  but where it's UN tanks
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.120]  that's what this treaty is to do this
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.120]  and then there's the cowboy in front of it
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.120]  but I'll find that in a moment
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.120]  if you go to drudgereport.com
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.120]  it's top three stories Harry Reid on cattle battle
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.120]  it's not over under that Ron Paul Warns feds
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.120]  that launched Waco Style Assault
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.120]  that's an info wars.com article
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.120]  and then a great photo
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.120]  an image
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.120]  an article of CBS News
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.120]  founding fathers didn't create government like this
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.120]  and it's a story with
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.120]  the man who's on with us right now
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.120]  Cliven Bundy
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.120]  and you know his quotes the one he has to say
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.120]  but he basically
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.120]  gives his point and
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.120]  people are sick of it I happen to run into
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.120]  three
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.120]  well I ran into two that somebody told me about another
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.120]  Austin cops on Saturday
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:35.120]  who all said hey isn't it great
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.120]  that nothing violent happened and that
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.120]  the feds back down it is time for us to push back
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.120]  you know the feds
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.120]  have too much land there
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.120]  the taxes are too high everybody knows
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.120]  we're being screwed here
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.120]  and so just the image
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.120]  of the cowboys riding down
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.120]  being threatened to be shot going over
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:55.120]  all of this happening is so archetypal
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:57.120]  and so powerful
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.120]  all right Cliven I want to give you the final comments here
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.120]  about trying to get these
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.120]  armed paramilitaries out of your area
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.120]  where your family's been since 1877
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.120]  I wish they'd be down on the border
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.120]  but Obama's getting rid of that I wish they would
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.120]  you know deal with some actual
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.120]  crime I can show some crack dealers
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.120]  down the street from where my office is
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.120]  but no I guess they're out there making sure
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.120]  on thousands of square miles nobody
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:21.120]  holds up a protest sign against the BLM
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.120]  well you know
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.120]  I guess this is my
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.120]  opportunity to say
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.120]  we need to get rid of these
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.120]  bureaucracies
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.120]  basically the arms of them
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.120]  you know
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.120]  arms I'm talking about the guns
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.120]  that they carry around
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.120]  we've got bureaucracies all over the country
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:45.120]  and they are creating their own armies
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.120]  in the bureaucracies and then they bring
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:49.120]  these bureaucracies together to come against
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.120]  we the people
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.120]  and you know they've created an army
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.120]  within the United States
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.120]  it's even bigger
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.120]  than the army that we have to fight the world
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.120]  and so it's time now
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.120]  to take these guns
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:05.120]  away from these people
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.120]  and give the
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.120]  sheriff our policing power
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.120]  back to our sheriffs and hey
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.120]  if our sheriff needs help we
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:15.120]  the people will help those sheriffs take care
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.120]  of things but they
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.120]  these sheriffs have good deputies
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.120]  and let them have our
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:23.120]  policing power we the people
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.120]  who
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.120]  have elected and pay
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.120]  these sheriffs to protect our life, liberty
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.120]  and property we
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:33.120]  have no desire
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.120]  anymore in this United States
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.120]  for the United States government
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.120]  to be carrying weapons
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.120]  and acting like sheriffs
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.120]  stuck in right now
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.120]  and county sheriffs get the job done
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:47.120]  take these arms away
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:49.120]  from these bureaucracies
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.120]  I agree with you
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.120]  let me play a clip of
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.120]  Obama
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:57.120]  a clip of Obama
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:59.120]  where he said they want a
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.120]  domestic security force just as big
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:03.120]  just as strong as our military and they've
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.120]  armed almost every federal agency
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:07.120]  spending up to $198 million
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.120]  per social security building
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.120]  with private mercenaries
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.120]  actual combat troops
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.120]  combat veterans
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.120]  cream of the crop
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.120]  thousands of armored vehicles deployed
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.120]  and delivered helicopters
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:23.120]  open training to take on the tea party
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.120]  that's in Forbes magazine
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:27.120]  we of course broke it but I'm saying it's mainstream news
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.120]  what do you make
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.120]  of them building up this domestic
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.120]  army I want to get your take on that
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.120]  but first here's this clip of Obama
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:37.120]  candidate Obama in 2008
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.120]  we cannot continue to
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.120]  rely only on our military
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.120]  in order to achieve the national
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:45.120]  security objectives that we've set
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:47.120]  we've got to have a civilian
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:49.120]  national security force that's just
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.120]  as powerful just as strong
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.120]  just as well funded
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.120]  and who do they deal with well they deal
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.120]  with ranchers in the middle
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.120]  of a wasteland
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.120]  Clive your comment on that
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.120]  that's exactly what was
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.120]  coming against we the people
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.120]  as a ranger we the people here
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.120]  in Clark County that is exactly
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.120]  what they were doing that was
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.120]  exactly the army that was coming against
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.120]  we the people and that's exactly
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.120]  the army I'm saying county sheriff
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:19.120]  this are them and each county
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.120]  server they're like 31 other
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.120]  counties sheriff in this
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.120]  United States each one of
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.120]  you take your responsibility
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.120]  and get the guns away from these
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.120]  people they are army
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.120]  within us and then
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.120]  individually you can take care
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.120]  of that those farms in your county
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:39.120]  they won't have to be a big
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.120]  national or international war
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.120]  get the job done
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.120]  well back in 1962
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.120]  or 61 when they had the UT
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.120]  tower shooting I forget the year
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.120]  my buddy Mike Hanson's dad
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.120]  there's famous photos at the museum
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.120]  of his dad in the ambulance getting
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.120]  shot and the ambulance getting shot up
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.120]  as he pulled around saving people that were shot
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.120]  and while he's getting people
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.120]  into the ambulance
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.120]  his dad was a hot rod racer
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.120]  that's why he became an ambulance driver
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.120]  the old days those guys drove a ghost buster
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:11.120]  style ambulance
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.120]  so he'd drive that up down congress but
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.120]  there's all these photos of his dad
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.120]  sitting there picking the people up getting them into the
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.120]  by himself but the most stretcher is getting them in there
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.120]  he was a big guy
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.120]  and they were shooting at him
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.120]  and everybody just pulled their rifles
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.120]  out and pinned him down
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.120]  so a citizen
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.120]  the police department and I've interviewed both of them
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.120]  could
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.120]  let one of them became a Texas Ranger later
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.120]  could go up and kill that guy
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.120]  and it was actually the
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:41.120]  civilian as they'd call him who
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.120]  actually got the first shots off and then the cop shot him as well
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.120]  but both of them
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.120]  had courage but I mean nowadays
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.120]  imagine if somebody was on a tower
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.120]  and citizens started pulling guns out
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.120]  I guarantee you the cops would probably shoot you
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.120]  and it just shows the domestication
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.120]  situation
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.120]  1966 sorry go ahead
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.120]  well yeah we've got to change this around
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.120]  the
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.120]  sovereignty the placing powers in we the people
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.120]  and we only give part of that
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:09.120]  power to our county sheriff
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.120]  and we did we give no
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.120]  power to the United States
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.120]  government in that in that sense
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.120]  to come down that gives the citizen the power
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:19.120]  the United States government is supposed to
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.120]  deal with foreign problems not not
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.120]  within the United States not we the people
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.120]  you get your armies
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:27.120]  and fight the battle
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.120]  somewhere else to protect
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.120]  this land not
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.120]  harass their people
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.120]  well that's right every third world cesspit
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:37.120]  has a domestic military that rules over
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.120]  the people and becomes an oppressive
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.120]  group of gangster thugs
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:43.120]  and we don't want gangster government final comment
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.120]  from you sir and then I want to give out your website
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.120]  and put his blog on screen for TV
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:49.120]  viewers and I'll get the URL
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.120]  for folks so I can give it out here on air
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.120]  but
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:55.120]  if you're a
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.120]  of MSNBC I guess he kind of represents
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.120]  the establishment
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.120]  a so-called Republican
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:03.120]  and we've had some other Republican talk show host
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.120]  criticizing him not to your face but behind your
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.120]  back and having you on
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.120]  I'm not going to name names it's just very
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:11.120]  shameful and
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:13.120]  and misconstruing what's going on
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.120]  you know he says you need to obey the law
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.120]  I wanted to play that clip and let you respond
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.120]  to basically this entire group of people
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.120]  it's not libertarianism you actually
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.120]  if you respect
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.120]  the rule of law
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.120]  and there being laws
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:29.120]  this guy for 20 years
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.120]  has been breaking the law
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:33.120]  using federal land he hasn't been
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.120]  paying the grazing fees that
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.120]  everybody else pays for some reason
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.120]  this guy thinks that the laws
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.120]  that apply to every other rancher in the
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.120]  United States of America don't apply to him
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.120]  and
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.120]  there's no doubt the Bureau of Land Management
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.120]  overreacted this could have been handled much better
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.120]  so
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:53.120]  I think you go even people
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.120]  on the
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.120]  further boundaries of the right
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.120]  in the conservative movement think
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.120]  that if this guy is going
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.120]  to use federal land then this guy
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:05.120]  should actually pay the fees and he's
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.120]  he owes over a million dollars right now
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.120]  and so this is yes
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:11.120]  that's enough you want to respond to that
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:13.120]  because I mean Rosa Parks he has to follow
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.120]  the rule instead of the back of the bus
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:17.120]  go ahead
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.120]  I would like to respond to that
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.120]  first if I owe
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:23.120]  a million dollars
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:25.120]  if I owe that
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.120]  I'd be happy to pay that
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.120]  to the proper farm of government
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.120]  would have to be my state
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.120]  and the other thing is this is not about
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:35.120]  Clive and Bundy it's not about his cows
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.120]  they're not about his grazing rights
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.120]  but it's about his liberty
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.120]  and freedom of we the people
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.120]  and we the people is making this move
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.120]  not Clive and Bundy
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.120]  so America make it move
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.120]  as take these guns away
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:51.120]  from these bureaucracies
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.120]  and enjoy
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:55.120]  some freedom and liberty
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.120]  that's when we go out
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.120]  and enjoy picnic
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.120]  or depart as don't let those people
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:03.120]  ruin our picnic
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.120]  well I mean look bottom line
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.120]  your family had the rights
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.120]  they started claiming all these fees
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.120]  they ran all the other families
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.120]  off with the fees because they couldn't survive
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.120]  beef prices that are all time
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:17.120]  highs briefly can you speak to that
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.120]  beef prices being at all time
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.120]  highs because they admit people are getting out of the cattle business
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.120]  because of all the fines and fees
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.120]  and regulations
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.120]  well you know that's true
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.120]  the western United States
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.120]  could produce a lot of beef for American people
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:33.120]  and a lot of beef for the world
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:35.120]  we could be feedin these
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:37.120]  and you know this public land
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:39.120]  in the sense of public land
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.120]  should be producing beef
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.120]  it should be produced oil and coal
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.120]  and gas
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.120]  it should be producing things
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.120]  and that's what God made it for us to produce
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.120]  there's renewable resources
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:53.120]  and there are lots of resources
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.120]  and there's plenty
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.120]  there's plenty for us
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.120]  if we just use it
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.120]  and the world is needin beef
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.120]  and fuel and all these things
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.120]  and one of the reasons why our beef
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.120]  is sharp is because we're not using this land
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:09.120]  the other is
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.120]  like Argentina
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.120]  and
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:15.120]  Brazil these countries
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:17.120]  produce a lot of beef
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.120]  we have countries now like China
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:21.120]  that can afford beef
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.120]  and so they sell that beef
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.120]  to China
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:27.120]  instead of to America
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.120]  so our supply
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:31.120]  is import supply
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.120]  is falling away
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:35.120]  we need to start producing
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.120]  we need to produce beef on this land
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.120]  we need to use the people
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.120]  that's right
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.120]  well finally
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.120]  in your gut do you feel like this was
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:47.120]  a really big historical event
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:49.120]  and an example in a blueprint
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:51.120]  of Americans stopping their endless retreat
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.120]  from government bureaucracy
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:55.120]  and kleptocratic foreign offshore corporations
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:57.120]  that have hijacked the nation
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.120]  I feel like that those people
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.120]  that stood on that line against
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.120]  the United States guns
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:05.120]  it has to be historic
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:07.120]  a point where
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.120]  we're saying no more
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:11.120]  no more in America will we put up
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.120]  with this type of action
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:15.120]  well said well I tell you
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:17.120]  it's been
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.120]  Joel Scalzen who lives out near your area
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:21.120]  who's been predicting that the first resistance
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:23.120]  to agenda 21 physically
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.120]  will be communities that break
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.120]  away in Nevada
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.120]  in Utah and areas of Colorado
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.120]  in Idaho and other areas
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.120]  he's been predicting that
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.120]  that's got the people in it
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.120]  that'll be the first to resist
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:39.120]  and that's why there's a big exodus
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.120]  to Montana and to Wyoming
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.120]  and other areas of people
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:45.120]  fleeing the collapsing
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.120]  cities and just the evil
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.120]  well Mr. Bundy thank you so much
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.120]  for all your time we'll get more updates
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.120]  as this unfolds and we're watching your back
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:55.120]  and you watch ours
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.120]  but God bless you and we salute
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:46:59.120]  your bonafide
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:01.120]  real true grit sir
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:03.120]  and thank you America
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.120]  you're the
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.120]  greatest people not only you know
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.120]  as individuals you're great
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.120]  and there's people across this world
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.120]  who are all great and God's eyes
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:15.120]  bless you and thank you for this
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:17.120]  opportunity thank you sir there goes
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:19.120]  Mr. Bundy and
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:21.120]  there's no fault with this man
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.120]  and as a libertarian
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.120]  you can't be what I call
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.120]  a cafeteria libertarian
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.120]  where you just pick and choose
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.120]  if you're a constitutionalist
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.120]  and I guess I just
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:37.120]  have more knowledge than a lot of people
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:39.120]  I'm not bragging it just freaks me out
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:41.120]  I want to believe that people like Scarborough
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:43.120]  and Glenn Beck and George Soros
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.120]  and Media Matters and CNN
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.120]  and Rachel Maddow
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.120]  and Salon
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.120]  and
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:53.120]  all the groups attacking me
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:55.120]  because they know we've started the story
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:57.120]  Drugs carried it they don't like drugs
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.120]  they don't like us because we're real libertarians
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.120]  they don't like world end daily because they're real
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.120]  I mean we really
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.120]  want to beat the new world order I mean we really
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.120]  do want freedom
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:09.120]  and you know I didn't want there to be a war
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.120]  starting I didn't want there to be a shootout
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:13.120]  I was on the edge of my seat watching all this
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.120]  unfolding here from Austin I had no idea it would get this crazy
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.120]  and then when it didn't happen and we had this
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.120]  victory I really savored it and knew how important
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.120]  it was and then I watched all the talking
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:25.120]  heads
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.120]  and said it wasn't a victory the feds are coming back
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:29.120]  of course they're coming back
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.120]  the point is we kicked their butt
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:33.120]  George Washington kicked the
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.120]  Hessians butts at
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.120]  Trenton and it didn't mean he didn't lose
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:39.120]  a bunch of other battles he had a fighting
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:41.120]  spirit
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.120]  it's the fighting spirit and knowing we're in
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:45.120]  the right and not letting the system always
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:47.120]  tell us we're in the wrong that is going to give
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.120]  us the moral high ground and we're going
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:51.120]  to win
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:53.120]  but they bought off all the big churches
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:55.120]  you go these churches I don't care
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:57.120]  what what they are here in Austin these big

[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.120]  know that
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  I don't want to hear your Romans 13 out of context
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:13.120]  or I want to hear Hitler was good
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.120]  and Stalin was good
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:17.120]  and Genghis Khan was good you know they weren't
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.120]  I want to hear that Moses should have done what
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.120]  Pharaoh said he was the government of God
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.120]  no he wasn't
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.120]  the whole Bible is about standing up and
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.120]  resisting tyrants and being enslaved
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.120]  and killed but then the next generation
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.120]  winning and persevering
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.120]  and I go listen to these preachers
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.120]  and they are a bunch of corporate whores
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.120]  who just won a big mega church
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:39.120]  in a mansion with their trophy
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:41.120]  wives they are devils
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:43.120]  I go to these big churches I can look
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:45.120]  at them and they are devils
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:47.120]  and they look at me and they
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:49.120]  they know and they don't like it
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.120]  because they are there to keep people
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.120]  that are looking for God down
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.120]  they are there to keep people that are looking
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:57.120]  for freedom down thinking they found it
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.120]  with them they are a fake facade
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.120]  and I just pray those facades
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.120]  are torn down and they are going to be torn down
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:05.120]  and
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.120]  Lord knows I am not perfect
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.120]  but I try to be a good man and I ask
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.120]  God to lift up info wars
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:13.120]  as God has already done and to empower
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:15.120]  me to be a stronger better person
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.120]  and then I will take whatever the consequences
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.120]  are God but I want to be used
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.120]  as a weapon against the new world order
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.120]  I just absolutely turn
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.120]  myself over
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:27.120]  to be a good man
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.120]  and I want to do what is right and I just
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.120]  give my will over to God
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.120]  and if you do that folks
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:35.120]  you will want to oppose these people
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:37.120]  it will burn in your bones
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:39.120]  if your preacher isn't calling
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.120]  for an end to the new world order
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:43.120]  isn't calling for an end to abortion
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.120]  it is just some glitter bug up there

[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.120]  here at one of the main IRS

[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:09.120]  article right there
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.120]  breaking all that down
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:13.120]  and how they stored the license plates
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.120]  remember how long we told
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:17.120]  you

[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.120]  random people's license plates
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:31.120]  folks a lot of the cars have it now
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.120]  and if you've got a us plate
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.120]  out and you got you lost your license

[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:41.120]  so you're driving a car like half
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.120]  people i know
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.120]  and you're wondering why you're constantly
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.120]  getting pulled over
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.120]  it's because they have you in a database
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:51.120]  that you don't have insurance
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:53.120]  or that you haven't paid the registration
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.120]  you've got to put

[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:07.120]  they don't get messed with
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:09.120]  nothing happens to them
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:11.120]  they are literally
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:13.120]  like cast for the friendly ghost
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:15.120]  no one can see them
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:17.120]  and it just shows how
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:19.120]  crazy it is to be in the system
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:21.120]  and they just keep
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.120]  writing the tickets and writing the tickets and writing the tickets
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.120]  so people go bankrupt
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:27.120]  they lose their job they go on welfare
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:29.120]  mission complete destroy

[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:51.120]  we'll get them
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:53.120]  and when libertarians and constitutionalists
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:55.120]  try to take over the republican party
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:57.120]  you'll have a giant horde
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.120]  of neocons there
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:01.120]  and fake conservatives
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:03.120]  demonizing anybody
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:05.120]  that talks about the fema camps

[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:11.120]  and they'll just say bundies are bad
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:13.120]  there are no bullets
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:15.120]  there is no new world order
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:17.120]  there are no checkpoints none of it's true
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:19.120]  none of it's true
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:21.120]  everything's fine
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:23.120]  everything's fine

[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:27.120]  but then they'll pay lip service and go
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:29.120]  I'm a libertarian talk show host
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:31.120]  I've given up on the republican
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.120]  establishment

[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:41.120]  by the democrats
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:43.120]  but we need to attack Putin
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:45.120]  we need to have this war in Russia
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.120]  Russia's behind the boss
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.120]  in bombing now
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.120]  and Alex Jones
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:53.120]  is bad

[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:03.120]  the good news is
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:05.120]  the message of liberty has already been put out
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:07.120]  the good news is
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.120]  that
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:11.120]  people know the score
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:13.120]  they know how things work now
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.120]  more and more that it's far and off for banks above the law
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.120]  tax exempt that are lobbying to raise taxes on poor people
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:19.120]  and they know the democratic party's
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:21.120]  race baiting creating racial division
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:23.120]  to make it about racial conflict in the future
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.120]  because they're going to screw everybody so bad financially
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:27.120]  they know everybody's going to leave them
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:29.120]  so they've got to just make it about race issues
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:31.120]  and of real issues
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:33.120]  and the republicans are just a bunch of sold out
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:35.120]  right wing of the democratic party
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.120]  desperately trying to destroy

[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:49.120]  Harry Reid's telling them look if I go down
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:51.120]  for this you're all going to go down

[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:29.120]  that's what most Americans want
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:31.120]  raising the debt ceiling does not increase our debt
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:33.120]  nobody is listening to your telephone calls
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:35.120]  the debate is settled

[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:39.120]  and if people can't trust not only the executive
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:41.120]  branch but also don't trust Congress
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:43.120]  and don't trust federal judges
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:45.120]  we have some problems
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.120]  what's the difference at this point does it make
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:49.120]  everything is our song
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:51.120]  oh my gosh I love this song
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:53.120]  everything is cool when you're part of a team
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.120]  everything is our song
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:57.120]  when we live in our dream
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:03.120]  everything is better
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:05.120]  when we stick together
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:09.120]  we should cut into the centro the Ellen DeGeneres going
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:11.120]  oh my gosh president everyone loves it
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:13.120]  it's so wonderful
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.120]  everyone should thank you for the Obamacare
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.120]  oh my gosh
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:19.120]  and he goes well that's right Ellen
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:21.120]  it cuts it down to the prize of a phone bill
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.120]  or cable bill
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:27.120]  I mean lies
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:29.120]  well Ellen you can keep your doctor
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:31.120]  actually
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:41.120]  in your dreams
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:51.120]  oh he's so ridiculous
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.120]  everything is wonderful
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:59.120]  don't be extreme
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:01.120]  oh my gosh that bad man Bundy
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:03.120]  here's what I want to say about the Bundy ranch standoff
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.120]  and we're going into Obamacare, Tax Day
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.120]  all the rest of it
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:13.120]  it's that our four bears
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:15.120]  I saw a Boston Globe article
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:17.120]  more than a decade ago that estimated
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:19.120]  the amount of tea dumped in the harbor
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:21.120]  tea was a luxury from India at the time
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:23.120]  not cheap
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:25.120]  it was an upper class thing to even be able to have it
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:27.120]  was over six million dollars
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:29.120]  adjusted for today in one ship
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:31.120]  that they dumped into the harbor
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:33.120]  so they dressed up in disguises
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:35.120]  left the green dragon in
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:37.120]  went over
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:39.120]  and
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:41.120]  dumped the tea in the harbor
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.120]  and they also went around when redcoats would beat people up
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:47.120]  or rape somebody
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:49.120]  well redcoats would get found with a throat slit
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:51.120]  or they'd get them in public
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:53.120]  and dump hot tar on them
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:55.120]  which a lot of times kills you
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:57.120]  you see when you dump hot tar on somebody
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:59.120]  it creates third degree burns across the body
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:01.120]  and then they would put feathers on it
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:05.120]  and people say ah, hot tar and feather
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:07.120]  they would pour hot tar on people
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:09.120]  and of course that's called our founders
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:11.120]  we call them terrorists today
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:13.120]  according to the army in Fort Hood
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:15.120]  they say that the founding fathers would not be
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:17.120]  welcome
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:19.120]  in today's military
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:21.120]  military
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:25.120]  because
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.120]  they were about 50 times more aggressive
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:29.120]  than Clive Bundy
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:31.120]  you know I yelled at Piers Morgan
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:33.120]  and said listen
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:35.120]  it's about taking our guns and enslaving us
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:37.120]  stop the fake debate, you're trying to trick us
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:39.120]  you're a foreigner doing this
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:41.120]  go back to England redcoat
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.120]  nothing against the people in England
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:45.120]  you're a redcoat, you're a foreign soldier
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:47.120]  oh my gosh he yelled at him
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:49.120]  he just cried at
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:51.120]  I mean you don't raise your voice
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:53.120]  when the Brits
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:55.120]  came to take the guns from the Brits
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:59.120]  they were
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:01.120]  English citizens
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:03.120]  predominantly
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:05.120]  when they came
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:07.120]  Paul Revere wrote around saying
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:09.120]  to arms, to arms
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:11.120]  the redcoats are coming
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:13.120]  one with by land to it by sea
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:15.120]  prepare yourselves and then they started
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:17.120]  shooting people
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:19.120]  oh my gosh
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.120]  oh when the government funds the Ukrainians
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.120]  to overthrow the government
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:25.120]  and shoot the police in Molov cocktail
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:27.120]  oh my gosh the CIA
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:29.120]  asset on CNN
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:31.120]  by the way I don't just say that he's a middle-aged CIA
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:33.120]  Anderson Cooper
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:35.120]  just says it's a wonderful
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:37.120]  look how handsome that man is
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:39.120]  oh my gosh
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:41.120]  a little man
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:43.120]  I love the Molov cocktails so sexy
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:45.120]  oh they just shot that unarmed cop for no reason
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:49.120]  clearly it's an elective government not perfect
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:51.120]  but compared to a lot of globalist governments
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:53.120]  the point is it was an outside funded group
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.120]  imagine if some outside
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:57.120]  group of Russia was funding
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:12:59.120]  an overthrow of the government
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:01.120]  even if our government was bad I'd be against it
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:03.120]  because that's wrong I'm not a traitor
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:05.120]  but
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:07.120]  Obama went two years ago
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:09.120]  and Panetta went before the congress
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:11.120]  and said
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:13.120]  we can launch wars whenever we want
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:15.120]  and the congress is like excuse me
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:17.120]  that's a violation of the constitution
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:19.120]  why not they've already violated everything else
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:21.120]  with the NSA
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:23.120]  and the Patriot Act and the NDAA
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:25.120]  and all the power grabbing
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:27.120]  well they're the feds I mean they got guns
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:29.120]  I mean they got big badges
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:31.120]  let's kiss their butts immediately
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.120]  saw the new Muppet movie
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:37.120]  where the FBI guy keeps pulling out bigger badges
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:39.120]  with the Interpol
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:41.120]  and soon they got a delivery it was a pretty bad movie
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:43.120]  but that part was funny I took my kids to it
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:45.120]  pulls out a giant badge you know bigger than he is
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:47.120]  I think Joe Bannister
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:49.120]  he says he has a joke photo for
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:51.120]  it's not a joke about him and his family
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:53.120]  but it's a point out that
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:55.120]  they just worshiped this image of the badge
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:57.120]  and the uniform
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:13:59.120]  well then worship the Nazis then
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:01.120]  they had some of the best looking uniforms I've ever seen
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:03.120]  that's why
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:05.120]  they were made by Hugo Boss
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:07.120]  and I guess that's why they had Hugo Boss
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:09.120]  through the Star Wars uniforms
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:11.120]  same company
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:13.120]  for the imperial officers
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:15.120]  so it looks scary and authoritative
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:17.120]  I mean if a uniform is all that matters
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:19.120]  should the Nazis rule the earth
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.120]  they had the best uniforms ever
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:23.120]  seen an SS officer's uniform
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:25.120]  it poses a lot of power
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:27.120]  but I'm not going to wear one because I don't accept their ideology
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:33.120]  it's ridiculous ladies and gentlemen
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:35.120]  and the uniform of hard work
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:37.120]  and American ranchers
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:39.120]  and the American flags and the horses
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:41.120]  and the good looking people
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:43.120]  and the militia there with their guns
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:45.120]  those feds didn't know what to do
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.120]  with people in their own costumes
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:49.120]  because the whole world is a stage
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:51.120]  each of us players upon it
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:53.120]  it's time for Americans to take back the flag
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:55.120]  and the coal pepper flag
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:57.120]  and the cowboy hat and the images of freedom
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:59.120]  or whatever the image of freedom is
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:01.120]  that resonates with you
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:03.120]  because we are the people
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:05.120]  we are the authority
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:07.120]  not the big giant government buildings
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:09.120]  and the helicopters and the air force ones
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:11.120]  and marine ones
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:13.120]  and
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:15.120]  all the garbage
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:17.120]  all the red carpets all the pop
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:19.120]  is to make you feel small
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.120]  make you feel like a peasant
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:23.120]  emperors have been doing this for thousands of years
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:25.120]  learning that big walled cities trumpets to announce them
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:27.120]  makes everyone feel small
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:29.120]  so they can then abuse you
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:31.120]  well I don't want to live under that
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:33.120]  and this was pure civil disobedience
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:35.120]  because they had the grazing rights before
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:37.120]  the BLM had claimed these later
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:39.120]  he was the only guy still in business
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:41.120]  of 52 other families
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:43.120]  because they'd run all the others out
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:45.120]  when their families on wagon trains
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:47.120]  when nobody was out there
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:49.120]  not even Native Americans, that place nobody was out there
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:51.120]  that was the middle of nowhere
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:55.120]  and that's why they went out there
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:57.120]  so that there was no one they had to take the land from
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:59.120]  and then they produced
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.120]  you know my dad was down in Paraguay
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:03.120]  and we're going to our guest
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:05.120]  doing charity
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:07.120]  medical work he's done that off and on
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:09.120]  it was Paraguay or was it Uruguay
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:11.120]  after he's gone to a bunch of those places
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:13.120]  and he saw the dynamite thrown on the field
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:15.120]  during a soccer game
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:17.120]  he went and saw one afternoon and it was on the news
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:19.120]  it was a hand grenade he said he saw it was a stick of dynamite
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:21.120]  the guy was like a hundred yards from him
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:23.120]  when he got up and threw it at the ref because he was mad at him
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:25.120]  about sports controlling people
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:27.120]  but the Amish
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:29.120]  are the only ones that feed the country basically
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:31.120]  they went and took the desert north
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:33.120]  and I went and looked it up online
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:35.120]  there it was in the news and built everything
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.120]  now the socialists want to take it from them
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:39.120]  and it's the same thing
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:41.120]  it's the same story over and over again
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:43.120]  of Amish trying to go to the middle of the nowhere
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.120]  desert to be left alone and turning it green
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:47.120]  and feeding the whole country
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:49.120]  there's a couple of South American countries
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:51.120]  where the Amish literally feed the whole country
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:53.120]  just because they're moral
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:55.120]  and don't stab each other in the back
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:57.120]  it's the same thing I would just call
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:16:59.120]  some of these Mormon folks
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:01.120]  out in the middle of nowhere doing the same thing
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:03.120]  and here comes the system
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:05.120]  and all they've got is being
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:07.120]  their own group and they're not going to live under it
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:09.120]  and that's the groups the homeland
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:11.120]  security trains to go after because they know
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:13.120]  in the end of the final equation
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:15.120]  you're not going to give in
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:17.120]  and then you're going to end up being leaders
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:19.120]  anybody that stands up in a city
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:21.120]  or a town, black, white, old, young
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:23.120]  Catholic, Jewish, agnostic, it doesn't matter
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.120]  if you stand up for basic liberty
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:27.120]  the system's going to come after you
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:29.120]  because you're a leader
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.120]  now speaking of leaders
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:33.120]  I was the first person to ever interview Joe Bannister
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:35.120]  for radio and TV
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:37.120]  Pat Shannon interviewed him for
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:39.120]  I think it was media bypass I forget
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:41.120]  or maybe Auntie Scheister I don't remember
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:43.120]  and
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:45.120]  I went and I interviewed him
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:47.120]  while I was out covering Operation Urban Warrior in 99
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:49.120]  and he had just quit as a treasury agent
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:51.120]  and one of the raids and stuff
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:53.120]  when he heard a radio show
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:55.120]  claiming that the IRS
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:57.120]  was basically a collection agency it was a fraud
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:59.120]  the Federal Reserve was really private
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:01.120]  he said that's all crazy
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:03.120]  spent a year trying to disprove it
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:05.120]  found out that was all true
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:07.120]  went and told his superiors about it
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:09.120]  they said go ahead and resign, he did resign
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:11.120]  then they tried to put him in prison repeatedly
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:13.120]  for speaking out, that made national news
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:15.120]  and juries found him not guilty
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:17.120]  we're going to break but I wanted to get him on for 40 minutes here today
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:19.120]  the fraud that it is but briefly Joe
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:21.120]  what is your take on
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.120]  the situation with the Bundy Ranch
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:25.120]  and what's just happened
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:27.120]  Hi Alex, well thanks for having me
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:29.120]  Bundy's
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:31.120]  their fellow Nevadans
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:33.120]  I've been in Nevada since 2005
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.120]  and my heart goes out
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:37.120]  to them and to the people that were out there
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:39.120]  I was riveted
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:41.120]  watching the video stream
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:43.120]  with David Knight out there
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:45.120]  and Josh riveted like everyone else
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:47.120]  and rooting for them
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:49.120]  they're going up against a big tyranny
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:51.120]  and
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:53.120]  I just very
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:55.120]  very overjoyed that there's
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:57.120]  Nevadans like the Bundy's there
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:59.120]  to stand
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:01.120]  stand their ground
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:03.120]  well even if they claim the grazing rights
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:05.120]  were legal
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:07.120]  which I've looked at it's not, it's another fraud
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:09.120]  we got to push back someday
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:11.120]  it put the other 52 families out of business
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:13.120]  right I mean
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:15.120]  where else can they go
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:17.120]  what else can they do
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:19.120]  this is proof that
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:21.120]  the government won't be happy
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:23.120]  until you are homeless
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:25.120]  you've got nothing to eat
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:27.120]  and then if you'll just
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:29.120]  sign up to be evaluated
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:31.120]  by the death panel they'll like it just fine
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:33.120]  exactly they want control
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:35.120]  and who wasn't said the power
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:37.120]  to taxes the power to destroy
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:39.120]  it was George Washington first said it
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:41.120]  and then the second supreme court's chief justice said it
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:43.120]  and the power to taxes
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:45.120]  the power to destroy
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:47.120]  we're going to talk to Joe Bannister a true hero
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:49.120]  on the other side another man
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:51.120]  who stood up and went through living hell
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:53.120]  to tell the truth
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:55.120]  former special agent with the department of treasury

[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:09.120]  contains evidence on what I believe
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:11.120]  will cause the next 9-11
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:13.120]  I've just posted a video at
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:15.120]  www.next911exposed2.com
[02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:17.120]  that not only analyzes
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:19.120]  the contents of this document
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:21.120]  but it walks you through the exact timeline
[02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:23.120]  and when this 9-11 event is scheduled to occur
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:25.120]  just like 9-11
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:27.120]  had a lasting impact on our society
[02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:29.120]  this event will reshape America
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:31.120]  it will swipe trillions off markets
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:33.120]  and retirement accounts everywhere
[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:35.120]  and destroy the way of life of millions of
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:37.120]  unprepared Americans
[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:39.120]  but it will also trigger what promises to be
[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:41.120]  the biggest wealth transfer in the history of our nation
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:43.120]  but you only have a few weeks left
[02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:45.120]  to take all the necessary steps
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:47.120]  to protect yourself and your family
[02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:51.120]  just visit www.next911exposed2.com
[02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:53.120]  to view my newly released video
[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:57.120]  again, that's www.next911exposed2.com
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:21.120]  before it's too late
[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:23.120]  Daniel Webster
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:27.120]  in 1819 in the Supreme Court case
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:29.120]  attribution, the quotation came from the words
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:31.120]  of Daniel Webster and those of John Marshall
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:33.120]  in the Supreme Court case
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:35.120]  McCulloch v. Maryland
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:37.120]  Webster in arguing the case said
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:39.120]  an unlimited power to tax involves
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:43.120]  necessarily a power to destroy
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:45.120]  but the power of taxation
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:47.120]  by the states may be
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:49.120]  exercised
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:51.120]  so as to destroy it
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:53.120]  it is too obvious
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:55.120]  to be denied
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:57.120]  that the power to tax involves the power
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:59.120]  to destroy
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:01.120]  cannot be denied as the full quote
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:03.120]  well let me show you what agenda 21 is
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:05.120]  in Cloward and Piffin
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:07.120]  Forbes magazine today
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:09.120]  CBO Congressional Budget Office
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:11.120]  Obamacare will spend more
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:13.120]  tax more and reduce the deficits less
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:15.120]  than they previously thought
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:17.120]  well he says raising the debt limit
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:19.120]  doesn't raise the debt so there you go
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:21.120]  magic wand
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:23.120]  it's a spending projections for 2013-2019
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:25.120]  have increased
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:27.120]  with Obamacare
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:29.120]  $124 billion
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:31.120]  on taxpayers
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:33.120]  and by the way this is a great tax
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:35.120]  you're going to get to pay it
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:37.120]  20 different taxes administered by the IRS
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:39.120]  they're now announcing
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:41.120]  oh they will be grabbing your wages
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:43.120]  Obamacare was a database
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:45.120]  for you to come waive your rights
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:47.120]  to counsel
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:49.120]  and the right to remain silent
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:51.120]  and give them the right to come after your bank account
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:53.120]  and increase the prices
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:55.120]  and it's a tax to a foreign group of banks
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:57.120]  that own the insurance companies
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:25:59.120]  but that's not the first time
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:01.120]  the IRS pays the private Federal Reserve
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:03.120]  as Obamacare exposed so why not
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:05.120]  if we already paid the Federal Reserve all this money
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:07.120]  and the Federal Reserve private banks
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:09.120]  own the big insurance companies
[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:11.120]  why not pay money directly to them
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:13.120]  Obamacare, former Treasury agent
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:15.120]  break down what I just said
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:17.120]  all this is going
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:19.120]  well again thanks for having me on Alex
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:21.120]  you know
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:23.120]  the thing is we only
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:25.120]  there's only 545
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:27.120]  people
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:29.120]  that run our lives
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:31.120]  if you think about it 9 Supreme Court justices
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:33.120]  a president 435 members
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:35.120]  of Congress and 100 senators
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:37.120]  and it really is
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:39.120]  within our grasp
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:41.120]  to
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:43.120]  change
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:45.120]  we change those 9 Supreme Court justices
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:47.120]  so quickly
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:49.120]  but
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:51.120]  those other 536 people
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:53.120]  it's really not that difficult
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:55.120]  but the problem is that you have 30-40%
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:57.120]  of the population that loves
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:26:59.120]  the servitude
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:01.120]  that we're being given
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:03.120]  and the rest of the people that are
[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:05.120]  they're on the gerbil wheel trying to keep up
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:07.120]  as you say with the Federal Reserve
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:09.120]  and the income tax who can blame people
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:11.120]  trying to just keep
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:13.120]  their families fed
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:15.120]  but the thing is as you pointed out
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:17.120]  it's going to get a lot worse
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:19.120]  and so we better start fighting
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:21.120]  a lot more now
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:23.120]  while we still have a house
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:25.120]  to live in, a roof over our heads
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:27.120]  food to eat
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:29.120]  because the plans are as you pointed out so many times
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:31.120]  that we won't have those things
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:33.120]  and that's how they can really get control
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:35.120]  of us
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:37.120]  we don't even have a roof over our head or food to eat
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:39.120]  or if the food we have
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:41.120]  is low and four days of water
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:43.120]  and like I say
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:45.120]  just one foot in the grave and one foot on a banana peel
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:47.120]  when you were first speaking out
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:49.120]  15-16 years ago before all your trials and tribulations
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:53.120]  it was pretty rare to have folks
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:55.120]  saying what we're saying now
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:57.120]  so much of what we talk about is almost passé
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:27:59.120]  it's hidden in plain view
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:01.120]  but then no one gets in trouble
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:03.120]  what do you call that paradox?
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:07.120]  it really kills me
[02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:09.120]  to see that smug look
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:11.120]  on Harry Reid's face
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:13.120]  in that interview that was published yesterday
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:15.120]  that's when I saw it
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:17.120]  where he's saying it's not over
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:19.120]  it makes me sick
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:21.120]  to my stomach to think that people like that
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:23.120]  can not only get into office
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:25.120]  but stay in office
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:27.120]  and then work with their own children
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:29.120]  and then a point
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:31.120]  the head of the BLM
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:33.120]  and they're all just this little cabal
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:35.120]  where Harry Reid is like
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:37.120]  the king of Nevada
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:39.120]  and he literally is so smug
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:41.120]  and then you can replicate that
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:43.120]  of course by all 50 states
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:45.120]  they have their corrupt people
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:47.120]  Corzine in New Jersey
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:49.120]  and Feinstein and Boxer
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:51.120]  out in California
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:53.120]  they all have their little fiefdom
[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:55.120]  their little kingdom
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:57.120]  and they're just
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:28:59.120]  destroying America
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:01.120]  all 50 states at once
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:03.120]  because of these senators and congressmen
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:05.120]  getting sent to office
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:07.120]  and it just drives me crazy
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:09.120]  as you say over 15 years
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:11.120]  that I've been in this
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:13.120]  it's been very gratifying to see more and more people
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:15.120]  come in and help row the boat
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:17.120]  and my hat's always been off to you
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:19.120]  because you were in it even before me
[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:21.120]  we met there
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:23.120]  I think it was March or April of 1999
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:25.120]  when you were filming your police state
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:27.120]  2000
[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:29.120]  I want to come back and get into what the IRS is
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:31.120]  where it's going
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:33.120]  and the fact that they won't prosecute the illegals
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:35.120]  putting in fake tax returns
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:37.120]  it's just incredible
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:39.120]  all the things they're doing
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:41.120]  and how the big corporations don't pay hardly any tax
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:43.120]  because Warren Buffett
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:45.120]  all of it with Joe Bannister
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:47.120]  I'm going to give your website out he has an excellent website
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:49.120]  we'll put that on screen
[02:29:49.120 --> 02:30:01.120]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:03.120]  the globalists have controlled the mainstream media
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:05.120]  for a long time
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:07.120]  but now they're expanding
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:09.120]  making the weaponization even more vicious
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:11.120]  and deceptive
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:13.120]  all the major networks are state run
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:15.120]  we are partnering this year with the NFL
[02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:17.120]  the NFL has become a political weapon
[02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:19.120]  the American amendment pushes Obamacare
[02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:21.120]  MSNBC tells us that
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:23.120]  our children belong to the state
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:25.120]  we have to break through our kind of private idea
[02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:27.120]  that kids belong to their parents
[02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:29.120]  or kids belong to their families
[02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:31.120]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:33.120]  it is more important than ever to realize
[02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:35.120]  that we are not the alternative media
[02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:37.120]  we are the true media
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:39.120]  the establishment dinosaur press is dying
[02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:41.120]  we are in an information war
[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:43.120]  and we are losing that war

[02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:25.120]  in your tap water
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:27.120]  on average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate
[02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:29.120]  at least once a week
[02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:31.120]  few filters cut out the glyphosates
[02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:33.120]  that is found in water supplies worldwide
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:35.120]  remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines

[02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:41.120]  and we see the global starting war
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:43.120]  with Russia we see
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:45.120]  all the craziness going on
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:47.120]  we see the massive bureaucratic
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:49.120]  taxes increasing
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:51.120]  Obama promised to not raise taxes
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:53.120]  they're going to just eat us alive
[02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:55.120]  and they can just keep saying
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:33:57.120]  it's the law
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:33:59.120]  it's the law and blackmail the supreme court
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:01.120]  to sign off on it
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:03.120]  at a certain point we're going to have to turn this around
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:05.120]  we're going right back to Joe Bannister
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:07.120]  here in just a moment to give him the floor to talk about
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:09.120]  the situation on tax day
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:11.120]  and wins enough enough half the country now
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:13.120]  not even in the work roles
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:15.120]  the rest hanging on by their fingernails
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:17.120]  almost everybody I know
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:19.120]  is having real hard times
[02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:21.120]  and the answer is more taxes more regulations
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:23.120]  more bureaucracy
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:25.120]  we're going to talk about that with Joe Bannister here on April 15
[02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:27.120]  but before I go any further
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:29.120]  remember that the globalists
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:31.120]  use making people poor
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:33.120]  a system of control
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:35.120]  and every time we cover Bilderberg or a globalist event
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:37.120]  we get the intel that they're mad
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:39.120]  that people have money
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:41.120]  to be able to come and protest them
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:45.120]  or that people are even able to go do that
[02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:47.120]  and I saw so many comments online
[02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:49.120]  like I'm going to spend my $200 savings
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:51.120]  to drive from
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:53.120]  Oregon down to Nevada it's all the money I got
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:55.120]  or I can't go I don't have the money for gas
[02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:57.120]  I mean it's just
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.120]  what an incredibly enslaved nation
[02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:01.120]  that people
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:03.120]  have paycheck to paycheck
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:05.120]  and our standard living is going down
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:07.120]  with automation everything we should have more money than ever
[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:09.120]  the globalists admit this
[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:11.120]  they're trying to make us poor
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:13.120]  it's like Obama telling Africans
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:15.120]  let's try to find that
[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:17.120]  you can't have air conditioning or cars
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:19.120]  as he lands in $50 million a day to run his operation
[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:21.120]  it's all about
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:23.120]  you being
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:25.120]  totally poor, them being totally rich
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:27.120]  while they attack the middle class
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:29.120]  saying they're stingy and evil
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:31.120]  and greedy because they want to be middle class
[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:33.120]  and Clive and Bundy
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:35.120]  he's a horrible thief on range fees
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:37.120]  because the range fees
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:39.120]  ran off to the other 52 families that came
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.120]  their own wagon trains
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:43.120]  in 1877
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:45.120]  because they got fooled
[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:47.120]  into signing on to it when they already had the rights on record
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:49.120]  and he just said I'm not doing this
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:51.120]  I'm not going bankrupt
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:53.120]  and they said here's a paramilitary army coming for you
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:55.120]  we're gonna go back to Joe Bannister
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:57.120]  here in a moment just remember
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:35:59.120]  we don't get taxpayer money like MSNBC
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:01.120]  they got stimulus and taxpayer
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:03.120]  and we don't get taxpayer money like MPR
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:05.120]  and others
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:07.120]  we don't get product placement
[02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:09.120]  behavior placement as the media calls it
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:11.120]  we don't get product placement
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:13.120]  with government ads here

[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:19.120]  okay Joe I've been ranting I want to give you the floor now
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:21.120]  and also tell us the latest over at your excellent website
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:23.120]  with all the resources
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:25.120]  that are there to document things for folks
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:27.120]  I think it's key to explain to people this is illegitimate
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:29.120]  as you've been doing for 15 years
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:31.120]  and it really is it's not just your opinion
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:33.120]  and where it's all going
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:35.120]  but even if the IRS had been legitimate
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:39.120]  it's not
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:41.120]  but if you've got all these big corporations that
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:43.120]  write the rules like Warren Buffett
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:45.120]  the biggest recipient of bailout money
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:47.120]  tax money but also
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:49.120]  you know lobbied for it
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:51.120]  and then lobbies for increased taxes on poor people
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:53.120]  claiming that's Rob from the rich
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:55.120]  give to the poor it's Rob from the poor give to the rich
[02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:57.120]  how do we shatter that paradigm
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:59.120]  for folks and let them understand that
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:01.120]  literally the IRS
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:03.120]  is a collection agency
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:05.120]  for a foreign consortium
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:07.120]  well Alex what I like to do
[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:09.120]  is you know the IRS likes to
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:11.120]  look at a paper trail to use a paper trail
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:13.120]  to go after the average citizen
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:15.120]  and so I encourage people
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:17.120]  to look at the IRS's paper trail
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:19.120]  and the paper trail begins
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:21.120]  as you know and I've told your listeners many times
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:23.120]  back in the early 1900's
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:25.120]  culminating in 1913
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:27.120]  with the alleged
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:29.120]  ratification of the 16th amendment
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:31.120]  and
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:33.120]  not surprisingly
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:35.120]  the Federal Reserve Act coming in of the same year
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:37.120]  and that's where it began
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:39.120]  now of course they lied
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:41.120]  about the ratification of the 16th amendment
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:43.120]  but the courts have done their best
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:45.120]  to dismiss that as an issue
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:47.120]  okay fine but it's still a fact
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:49.120]  if people want to look it up
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:51.120]  but even if the 16th amendment was ratified
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:53.120]  lo and behold
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:55.120]  the Supreme Court ruled
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:57.120]  that the 16th amendment did not
[02:38:57.120 --> 02:38:59.120]  expand federal
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:01.120]  taxing power
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:03.120]  it's not Alex Jones' opinion
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:05.120]  it's not Joe Bannister's opinion
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:07.120]  it's numerous Supreme Court cases
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:09.120]  that said so
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:11.120]  and the Supreme Court also ruled
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:13.120]  they defined what income
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:15.120]  the word income is as an income tax
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:17.120]  and the problem
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:19.120]  is that the IRS has been
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:21.120]  you know BSing the public all these
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:23.120]  decades that they have
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:25.120]  income when they go to work every day
[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:27.120]  at an hour of their time for an hour
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:29.120]  of pay and the thing is
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:31.120]  that that doesn't square with what the Supreme Court
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:33.120]  says that income is
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:35.120]  also most Americans
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:37.120]  are not liable to pay
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:39.120]  the federal income tax
[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:41.120]  these are facts the IRS even
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:43.120]  acknowledges that you're
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:45.120]  required to file a tax return
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:47.120]  with the IRS for any
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:49.120]  tax you are liable for
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:51.120]  look it up in the instruction booklet
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:53.120]  I like the way Alex you always
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:55.120]  tell people look it up
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:57.120]  the only problem is that not enough people
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:39:59.120]  look it up
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:01.120]  because these are facts
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:03.120]  and it's only the IRS using their little
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:05.120]  pamphlets and flyers
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:07.120]  and handouts
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:09.120]  and the fact that their own agents
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:11.120]  that's what they use is flyers and handouts
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:13.120]  rather than the actual internal revenue
[02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:15.120]  codes Supreme Court cases
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:17.120]  and then you've got the federal judiciary
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:19.120]  the appellate courts
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:21.120]  who are not ruling in line
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:23.120]  with the US Supreme Court
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:25.120]  so actually the landscape
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:27.120]  isn't all that difficult
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:29.120]  to understand if you just
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:31.120]  take a look and as Alex Jones
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:33.120]  always tells people look it up
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:37.120]  keep going I mean walking through this
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:39.120]  and then tying it in
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:41.120]  to all the persecution you've
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:43.120]  gone through where you think
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:45.120]  this country is going versus
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:47.120]  where you'd like to see it go
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:49.120]  well I'm sure many
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:51.120]  many people know maybe they don't know
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:53.120]  that the graduated income tax
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:55.120]  is the darling of Carl Marx
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:57.120]  it's one of the ten planks of the
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:59.120]  communist manifesto
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:01.120]  it's a book that Marx wrote with Engels
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:03.120]  it's an actual book
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:05.120]  and they called for all of these things
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:07.120]  to advance Marxism
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:09.120]  and a graduated income tax
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:11.120]  is a Marxist darling
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:13.120]  it's not a Jeffersonian darling
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:15.120]  it's not a Washingtonian
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:17.120]  darling it's a Marxist darling
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:19.120]  and we have it also a central bank
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:21.120]  is another Marxist darling
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:25.120]  and these systems
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:27.120]  are about robbing you of your
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:29.120]  property and controlling you
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:31.120]  and we now have a hundred years
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:33.120]  over a hundred years
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:35.120]  2013 was the
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:37.120]  100th anniversary of
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:39.120]  the 16th amendment
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:41.120]  and the Federal Reserve Act
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:43.120]  so we have over a hundred years of track record
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:45.120]  to see that all these
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:47.120]  so-called conspiracy theorists
[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:49.120]  that said that these systems were all about
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:51.120]  control
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:53.120]  and taking your property
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:55.120]  that's what's happening that's what's been happening
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:41:57.120]  for decades and
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:41:59.120]  with Mr. Bundy and his family you've got the BLM
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:01.120]  rather than the
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:03.120]  income tax per se
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:05.120]  but don't worry the income tax agents
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:07.120]  if they haven't already been banging down his door
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:09.120]  they will as well
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:11.120]  a bureaucracy has multiple
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:13.120]  alphabet soup agencies to
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:15.120]  stick on you
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:17.120]  and they're going to overwhelm you
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:19.120]  until we recognize
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:21.120]  we're 300 million people
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:23.120]  they're 545
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:25.120]  people
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:27.120]  the deck is actually stacked in our favor
[02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:29.120]  if we would just realize it
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:33.120]  just to understand the
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:35.120]  evil of the system we're dealing with
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:37.120]  and how they targeted you why don't you tell listeners
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:39.120]  briefly Joe
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:41.120]  just to recap of all the persecution
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:43.120]  through but the system
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:45.120]  ended up working because the system
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:47.120]  is being discredited the establishment system
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:49.120]  our old system the jury
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:51.120]  did end up actually finding you're not guilty
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:53.120]  that's right
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:55.120]  and as much as we all rail about
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:57.120]  how our rights are being destroyed
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:42:59.120]  and picked apart
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:01.120]  we still have a few of them left and those are the rights
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:03.120]  of course we have to use
[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:05.120]  to get our country back
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:07.120]  I did have a jury
[02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:09.120]  trial basically the IRS
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:11.120]  and the Department of Justice
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:13.120]  well primarily the IRS
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:15.120]  95% of what they
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:17.120]  do does not involve a jury
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:19.120]  you basically have to be charged
[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:21.120]  criminally in order to get a jury
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:23.120]  of your peers to evaluate your
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:25.120]  conduct and after
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:27.120]  I resigned in 1999
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:29.120]  and in 2004 I was
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:31.120]  indicted on four federal felony
[02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:33.120]  counts
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:35.120]  conspiring to defraud the United States
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:37.120]  of America and preparing three
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:39.120]  false amended income tax returns
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:41.120]  and the IRS had already
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:43.120]  been raking me over the coals
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:45.120]  civilly because in the civil arena
[02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:47.120]  the IRS
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:49.120]  there's no like I say no juries involved
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:51.120]  it's all administrative a lot of the things
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:53.120]  that Mr. Bundy is experiencing
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:55.120]  same with me
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:57.120]  and same with most Americans they can rake you
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:43:59.120]  over the coals administratively
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:01.120]  and you have no jury
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:03.120]  no judge even looking at the situation
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:05.120]  but you have to be charged
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:07.120]  criminally where you're going to face
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:09.120]  prison in order to actually have a jury
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:11.120]  evaluate your conduct
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:13.120]  and that's what happened to me
[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:15.120]  when I was indicted in 2004
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:17.120]  my trial occurred in June of
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:19.120]  2005 in Sacramento California
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:21.120]  and it lasted
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:23.120]  five to seven days
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:25.120]  and
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:27.120]  the jury learned how the
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:29.120]  government the IRS and the Department of Justice
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:31.120]  had no case against me
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:33.120]  they claim that I conspired
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:35.120]  with my client to defraud the United States
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:37.120]  of America yet my defense
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:39.120]  attorneys point blank asked
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:41.120]  each and every witness of the government
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:43.120]  did you witness any kind of conspiracy
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:45.120]  going on Mr. Bannister
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:47.120]  no did you encounter any
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:49.120]  documents that show that there was a conspiracy
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:51.120]  no did you see anything
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:53.120]  false on these income tax returns
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:55.120]  that the government claims are false
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:57.120]  no so the
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:44:59.120]  jury is just hearing from the government
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:01.120]  all of these things that say
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:03.120]  why are we here
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:05.120]  you claim that this man did all these
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:07.120]  bad things and you can't produce
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:09.120]  one witness or one piece
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:11.120]  of documentation to prove that it's the case
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:13.120]  why did you prosecute him
[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:15.120]  so thankfully I had
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:17.120]  12 thinking jurors we were a little
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:19.120]  concerned because it was in Sacramento California
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:21.120]  the capital of California
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:23.120]  there's a lot of government workers there
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:25.120]  but it was actually government workers
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:27.120]  in my case anyway
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:29.120]  who were they were champions
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:31.120]  of
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:33.120]  the jury process
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:35.120]  and actually paying attention
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:37.120]  and seeing that the government was trying to railroad me
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:39.120]  and they wanted the jury to buy
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:41.120]  into it and they weren't about to do that
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:43.120]  and so I was acquitted on all
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:45.120]  the charges
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:47.120]  and that was back in 2005 so like
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:49.120]  what almost like nine years ago
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:51.120]  now there's been other
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:53.120]  IRS agents not armed treasury
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:55.120]  agents like you who they've actually been able
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:57.120]  to throw in prison with ignorant juries
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:59.120]  but more and more we never used
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:01.120]  to see juries finding people not guilty
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:03.120]  more and more we are finding them not guilty
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:05.120]  and that's what the jury is there to do is judge
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:07.120]  the facts and the law
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:09.120]  it's very very simple you know sometimes
[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:11.120]  there is a time to not follow
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:13.120]  some fictitious regulation
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:15.120]  that's being misapplied a great analogy of that is
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:17.120]  they claim every year in August
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:19.120]  nationwide and every local paper
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:21.120]  it's the law to take vaccines there is no law
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:23.120]  to take vaccines they kick you out
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:25.120]  of school on policy
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:27.120]  they trigger the law on truancy
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:29.120]  but you can't trigger the law on truancy
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:31.120]  when you kick them out then it turns
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:33.120]  out they shouldn't be able to kick you out
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:35.120]  because the policy is not lawful
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:37.120]  in the courts because you're supposed to be able
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:39.120]  to be given a waiver from the policy
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:41.120]  but that extrapolates into Rick Perry
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:43.120]  saying it's the law
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:45.120]  you've got to take Gardasil six years ago
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:47.120]  and people took their daughters in and got
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:49.120]  the shot because the governor said
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:51.120]  it was the law nope
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:53.120]  the governor mandated
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:55.120]  their emergency powers
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:57.120]  that the state health department
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:46:59.120]  listed as one of the
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:01.120]  shots that they instruct
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:03.120]  the schools to comply and get people
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:05.120]  vaccinated but it's just that
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:07.120]  a bureaucratic order
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:09.120]  that's right
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:11.120]  and what you point out is very important
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:13.120]  Alex and that is you know the jury first
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:15.120]  of all that means that we all need
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:17.120]  to be informed to jurors and try
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:19.120]  to get on a jury rather than try to get off
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:21.120]  a jury or get out a jury duty
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:23.120]  and the second thing that I of course harp on
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:25.120]  because a lot of my families
[02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:27.120]  is in law enforcement and government
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:29.120]  service and that is
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:31.120]  that those are the boots on the ground
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:33.120]  those are the people like you saw
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:35.120]  in the videos there with the Bundy family
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:37.120]  those agents
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:39.120]  took an oath to
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:41.120]  support and defend the Constitution
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:43.120]  from all enemies foreign
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:45.120]  and domestic they took that oath
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:47.120]  before they were issued their boots
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:49.120]  before they got their rifle
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:51.120]  before they got their cool sunglasses
[02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:53.120]  that are probably have cameras in them
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:55.120]  before they got all
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:57.120]  that equipment they took an oath to support
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:47:59.120]  and defend the Constitution
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:01.120]  all those Las Vegas Metro
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:03.120]  officers on and on and on
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:05.120]  all the government bureaucrats everywhere
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:07.120]  they all took an oath
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:09.120]  okay and they need to remember that they took
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:11.120]  that oath before anything
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:13.120]  else happened before they even got their first paycheck
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:15.120]  and they need to remember
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:17.120]  what that oath said
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:19.120]  and they need to use their common sense to determine
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:21.120]  who are those enemies
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:23.120]  who are the foreign enemies
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:25.120]  who are the domestic enemies
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:27.120]  and then what can I do within my purview
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:29.120]  of my job to make sure
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:31.120]  that I abide by my oath
[02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:33.120]  now for me in order to abide by my oath
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:35.120]  I had to resign
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:37.120]  but there's still a lot of people that are
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:39.120]  in government service very good people
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:41.120]  including my own family
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:43.120]  and so we need
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:45.120]  everyone to educate themselves
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:47.120]  on the oath they already took
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.120]  and to do the right thing
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:51.120]  you sent us a photo tell us about this photo we're going to put up for TV viewers
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:53.120]  and describe it for radio listeners
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:55.120]  and why you want us to show it
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:57.120]  was that the photo of my family
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:48:59.120]  with all the uniforms and badges
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:01.120]  yeah to make the point yeah go ahead
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:03.120]  was best I can remember
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:05.120]  the guy in the far left in the tan
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:07.120]  uniform is my brother
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:09.120]  John he's a lieutenant in the California
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:11.120]  highway patrol
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:13.120]  that I believe the next is my
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:15.120]  brother Jeff he's a San Jose
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:17.120]  California police officer
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:19.120]  and then my mom Ann is in the middle
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:21.120]  my dad passed away
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:23.120]  just a few minutes a few months
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:25.120]  before I went into the IRS
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:27.120]  in 1993 otherwise he would have been in the photo
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:29.120]  then is my brother Jim
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:31.120]  he's a battalion chief
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:33.120]  in the daily city California
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:35.120]  fire department and I think
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:37.120]  over on the right is me with the white shirt
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:39.120]  and a treasury badge
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:41.120]  and I guess that was taken
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:43.120]  back in 1993 94
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:45.120]  yeah like 94 95 and then
[02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:47.120]  there's another picture of my uncle
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:49.120]  30 years as a deputy sheriff
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:51.120]  with Santa Clara County California
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:53.120]  so you know
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:55.120]  I just I love the picture
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:57.120]  not because I you know my poor relatives
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:59.120]  have to have that picture paraded around
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:01.120]  but you know as you are Alex
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:03.120]  I'm so sick and tired of this
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:05.120]  oh they're all anti-government zealots
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:07.120]  they just don't want to pay their fair share
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:09.120]  it's such a crock
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:11.120]  so I think that picture speaks
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:13.120]  with more than a thousand words
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:15.120]  well I'll say on average most police I've run into
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:17.120]  are more awake and more concerned
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:19.120]  about what's going on in the general public
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:21.120]  but the bad guys get put in charge
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:23.120]  especially of the feds
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:25.120]  or people that will just follow any order
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:27.120]  basically military and they treat me like I'm in Fallujah
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:29.120]  and have shot a RPG at them
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:31.120]  and they're trying to get more and more thug-like
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:33.120]  people in but that is something
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:35.120]  that's been holding the tyranny up
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:37.120]  is that there are a lot of good people in the system
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:39.120]  who do what they do out of compartmentalization
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:41.120]  I want to talk about that when we come back
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:43.120]  with Joe Bannister
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:45.120]  as they came after him a couple times
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:47.120]  trying to throw him in jail
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:49.120]  just forgiving speeches
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:51.120]  and telling people about the IRS
[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:53.120]  they said well you're telling people not to pay their taxes
[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:55.120]  you're in a conspiracy
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:57.120]  no his free speech is not a conspiracy
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:50:59.120]  it's an open plan to stop evil
[02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:03.120]  clean water at home
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:05.120]  clean water at the office
[02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:08.120]  einmal
[02:51:08.120 --> 02:51:10.120]  water Carl
[02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:12.120]  bla, bla, bla

[02:51:23.120 --> 02:51:25.140]  listen to the Fed

[02:52:01.520 --> 02:52:02.520]  Oh, this is Steve Shank.
[02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:06.280]  Why do police go undercover and why do countries send out spies?
[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:07.280]  Simple.
[02:52:07.280 --> 02:52:10.360]  If you can guess from intelligence what the other guy is doing, you have the battle
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:11.760]  won before it starts.
[02:52:11.760 --> 02:52:14.880]  Let's see what intelligence we have about your food situation.
[02:52:14.880 --> 02:52:19.440]  We're having the worst disasters ever, storms, earthquakes, floods, and terrible drought.
[02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:23.920]  Half our population needs food stamps and other subsidies to afford their food now.
[02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:27.360]  Prices have just hit their all-time high, with more terrible cost coming.
[02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:31.440]  Your food and now your water are being sold to other starving countries.
[02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:36.000]  Another one-third of our corn goes to expensive gas instead of feeding livestock and people.
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:39.800]  What few dollars you have, China expects to devalue to uselessness.
[02:52:39.800 --> 02:52:44.120]  If it's possible to get the most of the best food and freeze the availability and cost
[02:52:44.120 --> 02:52:48.040]  before it disappears and is unavailable, you don't dare miss the opportunity.

[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:30.480]  The average person says, hey man, pay your fair share, we've got to run the country.
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:36.040]  The IRS, the income tax came in 1913 and wasn't widely deployed until the 50s.
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:42.040]  It's designed according to Ronald Reagan's own commission in 81 in Congress to pay the
[02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:43.880]  national debt.
[02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:49.520]  The banks created it so when they had the income tax to pay the Federal Reserve, it
[02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:50.520]  came together.
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:51.680]  It's the takeover.
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:52.680]  Just like Obamacare.
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:56.960]  And I don't want to be here in 100 years, you know, people going, it's a conspiracy
[02:54:56.960 --> 02:54:59.280]  that Obamacare was a scam.
[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:02.720]  I mean, it's just come on, folks, stop being naive.
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:09.080]  It is so frustrating to know how much prosperity we could have, but the globalists want artificial
[02:55:09.080 --> 02:55:10.800]  scarcity.
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:14.040]  They do not want us to be able to be self-sufficient.
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:16.280]  I mean, they admit it.
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:19.400]  They say they want us under their control.
[02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:20.400]  This is their plan.
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:23.760]  Cloward and Piven is just one manifestation of that.
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:27.480]  Joe Bannister, I know I asked a question before the break, and I said we're going to come
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:32.600]  back at home or what it was, but we had about four minutes left looking at, there's a huge
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:33.880]  awakening happening.
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:35.560]  The system knows we're waking up.
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:38.240]  They're preparing the police and military for war.
[02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:41.760]  That's kind of waking the police and military up.
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:46.280]  And I think the big false flag is a civil war.
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:50.120]  I think that's the false flag to bring the country down, and then that lets the globalists
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:52.560]  take over is getting us killing each other.
[02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:56.080]  That's why I try as hard as I can to reach out to police and military.
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:57.760]  We've actually got the military.
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:55:59.720]  The globalists have a big problem.
[02:55:59.720 --> 02:56:01.600]  The military is really awake.
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:03.440]  Police are waking up fast.
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:08.800]  The heads, at least the ones they put out there, they just think they're going to follow
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:09.800]  orders.
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:11.240]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:17.800]  Well, what you said, you were talking about how a First Amendment protected activity,
[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:21.480]  free speech, can't possibly be a conspiracy.
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:25.920]  And my attorney, Bob Bernhoft, who had on the show that time he defended Westwood.
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:27.320]  I want to get you and him back on.
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:29.000]  That guy was amazing.
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.360]  He has this gallows humor.
[02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:38.280]  He calls it the conspiracy of full disclosure, where here you are, you're making speeches,
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:41.840]  you're telling your friends, you're completely doing things out in the open.
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:42.840]  Why?
[02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:45.880]  Because it's your right, because that's what Americans do.
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:51.680]  And yet the government will try to turn that into some kind of a criminal conspiracy, some
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:54.280]  kind of criminal conduct.
[02:56:54.280 --> 02:56:59.120]  And so, you know, it's gallows humor, but it really, it's illustrative, and I think
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:05.080]  that's why it's so important for us, the Bundy family, how they've shown with the horsemen
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:08.480]  and everyone there at that confrontation.
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:13.920]  They were peaceful, they were direct, they knew what their rights were, and they weren't
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:18.560]  going to back down in the face of tyrants trying to take their rights away.
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:21.880]  And I want to say something, just because Harry Reid, and I'll call him a criminal,
[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:25.880]  is so arrogant and has that smug look, that's criminology.
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:29.640]  They always think they're invincible, and that's their undoing.
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:32.080]  That's right, and that's why it's so important for people.
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:36.920]  Don't, you know, have this be something that makes you feel good and shows an example of
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:43.880]  how yourself know your rights, know what's going on, and politely, but firmly express
[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:49.360]  those rights if you encounter a bureaucrat or a police officer or a federal agent or
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:50.360]  whatever it might be.
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:53.560]  And when you see a bureaucrat or a cop doing the right thing, help them, support them,
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:54.560]  praise them.
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:55.560]  Absolutely.
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:57:58.840]  In closing, tell folks about all the great info on your website.
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:05.680]  Well, agentfortruth.com, there's a section called Become an Agent for Truth, and I think
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:09.320]  that does a, you know, since there's not a lot of time to go over this kind of stuff
[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:15.160]  in a show, people can do their homework a little bit and see more about the landscape,
[02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:19.760]  and you don't want everybody to be as safe as they can.
[02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:22.760]  But of course, freedom isn't free, and it's difficult.
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:28.360]  So agentfortruth.com is my little contribution to try to keep people safe as they are.
[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:32.360]  And you're a leading expert who's been through the wars, so folks want to think about things
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:34.440]  with the IRS thing to go to your site.
[02:58:34.440 --> 02:58:35.440]  Thank you so much, Joe.
[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:36.840]  I want to get you and your lawyer on soon.
[02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:37.840]  Thanks a lot, buddy.
[02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:38.840]  All right, thank you, Allen.
[02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:39.840]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:40.840]  Great job, everybody.

[02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:42.840]  God bless you all.
[02:58:42.840 --> 02:58:45.480]  Thanks for praying for the bundies and everybody else.
[02:58:45.480 --> 02:58:49.400]  Thank God we didn't have a Ruby Ridge or Waco or Wounded Knee there.
[02:58:49.400 --> 02:58:53.600]  Thank you, Jesus.
