[00:30.000 --> 00:40.000]  Sunday Live, humanity is winning, a globalist new order system isn't dying, it's dead.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  But they want to take us with them.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  And that's the big takeaway.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  Major glitches in the matrix.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  I can tell you that almost everyone that works for Mainstream Corporate News,
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  following the directives to divide and conquer the country and the world, do not buy into it,
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  and actually don't even like it.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  And the last straw, even the more evil ones, is they realize they're not even exempt
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  from the poison shots in the final equation.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  Wow, thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday, November 21st.
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  Worldwide broadcast, we have two very informative individuals joining us.
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  This is Drew Hernandez at the bottom of the hour to talk about the big self-defense trial of the century
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  with Rittenhouse and the aftermath of that and what comes next.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  And then a lawyer that worked on the case and worked on jury selection, Robert Barnes.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  Robert Barnes got us in contact with Rittenhouse, got his mom on the show.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  And so he's definitely been an insider on that whole deal.
[01:50.000 --> 01:59.000]  He's going to be joining us, coming up in the second hour, then there's Sunday Live with Owen Schreuer,
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  6 to 8 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  Let's put that headline back on screen for everybody.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  Because the time we're living in is so momentous,
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  we just want to sink in and kind of marinate our minds at this point.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  We're going to be alive. Humanity's winning.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  The globalist neural loader system isn't dying, it's dead, but they want to take us with them.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  What does that mean? There's a lot to unpack there and I'm trying to get to it coming up in the second segment.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  I'm going to really kick off the main broadcast. Some stations join us here in just a few minutes.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  But here's what you need to know.
[02:41.000 --> 02:54.000]  Corrupt systems usually take a lot of people with them in a big, big way.
[02:54.000 --> 03:04.000]  And so you need to understand historically that you guys print me the definition of genocide.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  I'd set it in, but I guess I didn't get it.
[03:08.000 --> 03:25.000]  And when a system is about to go down, the instinct and the default position is to engage in a giant war and or a genocide.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  And so that's where we are.
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  But it's a new type of genocide.
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  So many people, prominent people that I tried to wake up almost two years ago when they launched this whole great recent takeover.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  The fact that this was a designed collapse of society.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  Bigger than the virus killing people will be the breakdown of civilization by people being locked up and not going out.
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  The supply chain disruptions and mass starvation.
[03:53.000 --> 04:05.000]  And of course, the inevitable wars that will come out of that the angrier world that Klaus Schwab talks so much about.
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  What you're seeing is worldwide martial law being imposed.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  And we always knew lockdowns were coming.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  We always knew war were coming.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  We always knew for the quote, unvaccinated, they were coming.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  And we always knew they would start saying, oh, you need to shot every six months.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  And then you need to shot every two months.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  And then you need to shot every month and you ask how many shots.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  And they say, whatever it takes to slowly kill you.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  Because one shot's a little too obvious to kill you right away.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  Though some people, it has the desire effect a little too quickly.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  And so that's where this is all going.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  This is just genocide out in the open.
[04:40.000 --> 04:48.000]  And we have all the admissions and all the monsters involved in this Fauci and the rest of them that are calling for our arrest for exposing them.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  We have free speech, little monster.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  They're the ones that cooked it up and released the pretext for all this.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  And they're members of eugenics, clubs, publicly.
[04:59.000 --> 05:08.000]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  Horrible crashes and again, so many toxins on them.
[05:19.000 --> 05:27.000]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at infowarstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  And they're long lasting and they help focus your mind.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  And right now our strongest product, the three new tropics we have.
[05:35.000 --> 05:44.000]  Brainforce Plus, Brainforce Ultra and Turboforce are back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  Turboforce has been sold out for more than six months.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash.
[05:57.000 --> 06:06.000]  And it's available right now and it funds the infowar 360 win.
[06:06.000 --> 06:17.000]  The circle is now complete.
[06:17.000 --> 06:22.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:22.000 --> 06:31.000]  Live from the infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:31.000 --> 06:38.000]  Sunday, November 21st, 2021.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[06:41.000 --> 06:49.000]  I want to thank you all for being here today.
[06:49.000 --> 06:58.000]  If you go to infowarstore.com, you will see today's show headline that I'm going to read for folks here on air one more time because it's so important.
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.000]  Humanity is winning.
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  The globalist neural order system isn't dying.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  It's dead.
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  But they want to take us with them.
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  And here is a excellent example of that.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  NIH director calls for COVID conspiracists.
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  They have a new term.
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  To be brought to justice and arrested for telling the trick of the bottom.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  This man lied to Congress and said there was no gain of function.
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  He was over it with Fauci and Bill Gates.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  This man is a mass murderer.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  This man needs to be arrested along with Fauci and Bill Gates.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  This man is a globalist.
[07:40.000 --> 07:46.000]  And he's on record being connected to those groups and organizations just like Bill Gates and Fauci and the rest of these scallywags.
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  That's too good of a word for him.
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.000]  And so he goes on to say the conspiracy theorist conspiracists are winning.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  And they must not just be censored.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  They must be arrested.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  He says their narratives are failing.
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  Well, yes.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  And if we don't get arrested.
[08:06.000 --> 08:12.000]  Or we don't get shut down as you hit the panic button, you guys are all going to go to prison.
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  As usual, a bunch of old, imbred elitists thought they could take over the world.
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  Thought they could depopulate people and you triggered a war.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  Millions of people are on the streets worldwide.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  The police are now in military beginning to join them in mass.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  It's only a matter of time until they call in special units and they end up killing citizens.
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  And then the population is going to go into the major capitals and they're going to grab the globalist traders with the scruffs in their necks.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  And they're going to march them out and they're going to hang them in the square.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  I mean, look at these images from around the world.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  Millions in the streets in Italy.
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  Millions in the streets in Germany.
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  Millions in Austria.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  Our news will spit it and go, oh, there was a 10,000 in the streets.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  And they'll show up close shots of people marching down the street.
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  Now, how about millions, hundreds of thousands in London alone?
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  And it's just getting started.
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  So let's get to all that next segment.
[09:13.000 --> 09:21.000]  But let's look at these facts first because these are facts and these are big wake-up calls for everybody.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  Transparency.
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  FDA wants 55-year delay to provide Pfizer COVID vaccine data.
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  And I know that came out last Wednesday, but it's just now starting to get major papers and they're trying to defend.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  Well, we do want to keep the data secret for 55 years.
[09:37.000 --> 09:46.000]  Why in the hell when you did an emergency authorization for something and you say it's totally safe and now it's out there in the public and we know it's killing people and maiming them in mass,
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  would you then say, oh, it's good to keep that data secret?
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  See, they're testing to see if they can kill us and get away with it.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  And then once the rest of the governments of the world sign on to this, well, now they're ready for their next big step and the training wheels come off.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  The COVID is just the training wheels.
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  It's beta.
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  The next stuff they hit us with, if we submit, we're dead.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  If we submit, they go, okay, we got them locked down.
[10:11.000 --> 10:19.000]  They're not going to struggle or take things back when we bring in martial law and really absolutely release a real weapon on them, a super weapon on them.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  If you behave and comply, you're marked for dead.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  You're all being analyzed and assessed right now in live time by this exterminist cult.
[10:29.000 --> 10:36.000]  So transparency, FDA wants 55 year delay to provide Pfizer COVID vaccine data.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  Now, what does that tell you?
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  That's a pretty big deal, isn't it?
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  Here's Fauci.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  We got the video of this.
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  Fauci says Americans may need boosters every six months.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  I told you 20 months ago that was coming.
[10:50.000 --> 11:00.000]  It was in the Pfizer documents, two shareholders, their whole plan to remove the immune system and then make you have gene therapies for regular viruses and things where you'll die without it.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  You'll have to have them all the time, but they also slowly kill you.
[11:03.000 --> 11:11.000]  That's not just a science fiction plot for most science fiction books, like you name it.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  Stargate TV shows.
[11:14.000 --> 11:23.000]  I mean, every science fiction TV program from Twilight Zone, you name it, has this script.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  And now you're living it because you're living the year 2021.
[11:26.000 --> 11:27.000]  They're actually doing it.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  Fauci says Americans may need boosters every six months.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  And he says this, Fauci says babies and toddlers eligible.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  And as soon as they say eligible, that means they're going to force you within a week.
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  Oh, FDA authorizes boosters for adults. Oh, now it's mandatory.
[11:47.000 --> 11:48.000]  The headlines last week were well.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  They're about to make boosters mandatory too.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  You'll go to jail.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  You'll be fired.
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.000]  Fauci says babies, toddlers are eligible for COVID jabs next year, first quarter, just a few months away.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  Oh, yes.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  And notice whatever he says will happen.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  This is the FDA.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  Board doesn't approve it.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  They'll just remove them and put another board in.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  With people saying, well, I guess we got to find out what this does.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  Number three weeks ago when they approved it for children five up to 11.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  And the one of the members of the board said on TV, well, we got to find out what it does.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  We never tested it.
[12:20.000 --> 12:31.000]  Oh, but now you did test it in the public and we don't get to find out till the year 2070 something.
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  Here's some more headlines.
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  Vaccinated English adults under 60 are dying at twice the rate of unvaccinated people the same age.
[12:38.000 --> 12:45.000]  That's now in the Lancet medical journal, the British medical journal and on the official.
[12:45.000 --> 12:53.000]  You in Lancet and John Hopkins data dashboards that are the global standards.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  This is that nice.
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.000]  Not just Austria.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  Here are some of the other countries making COVID-19 vaccination compulsory for everyone.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  Dun dun dun dun dun.
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  Forbes.
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  And these guys just say it and you better do it.
[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  And then the head of what two weeks ago, the head of Pfizer says, I want to arrest people that disagree with us.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  And I said, watch, you'll see our leaders say that with a couple of weeks.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  And now they're saying arrest us because he's the boss.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  I mean, he actually might be a robot.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  You've seen the videos where his whole neck like he gulps at his whole neck like it's a piston goes up and down.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  I mean, these are some weirdos, man.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  These are some really freaky dudes.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  I mean, they might be aliens.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  I don't have any proof of that.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  I'm just saying hypothetically, like they're aliens in plastic suits or something.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  Because I mean, if aliens came in and wanted to kill us in a science fiction plot, that's how they do it.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  And they got like weird rubber skin and stuff.
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  I mean, I don't know.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  The media will run with Jones says they're aliens with rubber skin.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  It's satire.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  I'm illustrating how out of control they are.
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.000]  NIH director again calls for COVID conspiracist to be brought to justice.
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  Twice that earlier, the circle is now complete.
[14:06.000 --> 14:14.000]  It was the conspiracist Alex Jones 28 years ago, reading their own documents that they're going to set up a world government using viruses as control.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  And then they'll arrest anybody that points it out.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  They're going to break up our families and give us a world ID digital number system.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  And then now it's all here.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  And if we don't like it, oh, we need to be arrested.
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  We said they're going to set up a world government and start arresting people that say no to the forced inoculation.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  That's in four or five of my films.
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  There's video me 20 years ago, 18 years ago, 11 years ago, 10, you know, hundreds of videos.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  I just magically pulled it out of the air.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  No, it was out of their documents.
[14:40.000 --> 14:52.000]  And now we're if you if you talk about them arresting you or you talk about them forcibly inoculating you or how it doesn't really work, you need to be arrested.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  Exactly what we're saying.
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.000]  And that they'd have martial law and lockdowns and all of it because it was a damn plan.
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  I mean, again, operation lockstep from 2011 is the entire program we're under.
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.000]  And then you dovetail it and overlay it with spars 2023 document where they war game.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  It's really 2020 to 2023.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  But they say 2023 to 2025 and out you overlay it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:27.000]  And it's happening in real time, even down to the same tweets already pre-programmed and pre-written three years before, even firing in many cases on the same dates.
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  They just give them scripts and say, here was that tabletop drill we did.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  That's the exact program.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  I mean, they got it all figured out and all we got to do is figure them out and it's game over.
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.000]  But if we just keep responding and reacting to the new BS they put out, we're going to lose everything.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  But if we just pull back and go, oh, there's their whole operation, new world order, it's game over.
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  Again, you could argue maybe they didn't know that this wasn't a vaccine, it was in a kill a bunch of people, one out of a million.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  But even that, well, I'll explain when we come back.
[15:56.000 --> 16:15.000]  This is really important.
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  And they help focus your mind.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  And right now our strongest product, the three new tropics we have.
[16:33.000 --> 16:42.000]  Rain Force Plus, Rain Force Ultra and Turbo Force are back in stock at m4warstore.com.
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  Turbo Force has been sold out for more than six months.
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[16:49.000 --> 16:56.000]  This is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash.
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  And it's available right now and it funds the m4war 360 win.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  m4war's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later,
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[17:41.000 --> 17:46.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[17:53.000 --> 17:59.000]  Head to m4warstore.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[17:59.000 --> 18:05.000]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  In that documentary, I predicted the globalists would establish world government by releasing a virus,
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.000]  demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns, and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society.
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  And now they've done it. How did I know they would do it?
[18:21.000 --> 18:27.000]  Because they wrote books and white papers, and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group, who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab,
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.000]  and our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this great reset.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  Well, we're now living in it.
[18:39.000 --> 18:45.000]  The purposeful collapse of the Third World and the First World, known as the tyrannical corporate world government,
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  the total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family,
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.000]  and then incrementally, more and more deadly injections of poison mass-creating as vaccines to poisonice in the populace.
[18:56.000 --> 19:03.000]  This is what Info Wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future.
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates. You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  You didn't start a fight with the UN. They started a fight with you.
[19:37.000 --> 19:43.000]  And they're not going to back down, and they're not going to go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  until they have the fear of God put into them.
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.000]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order, or about globalism, or about corporate fascism.
[19:52.000 --> 19:59.000]  And it's not until people understand that, and that we're under attack that we have any chance of beating these people.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  They think you have no memory. They count on that.
[20:26.000 --> 20:32.000]  Remember, Fauci said, oh, the vaccine's 96% effective. It's really a vaccine.
[20:32.000 --> 20:38.000]  We said, no, it's a gene therapy. It will erase your immunity, and you'll have to continue to have the shots to even live.
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  That's the plan. That's what all the top scientists said, literally, before they even started the injections.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  We got the secret CDC document that they then published and made public via the FDA,
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  where they said it's going to cause microcarditis and heart attacks in October of last year.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  I mean, let that sink in. This is really happening.
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  Thanks for tuning in here to the All Shown Show Sunday edition.
[21:00.000 --> 21:06.000]  And then just two weeks ago, Fauci and Gates and a bunch of others come out and say,
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  oh, turns out it doesn't work. You're going to need shots every few months.
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  And it was all in the prospectus documents to shareholders a year and a half ago that this was permanent.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  And I played you Pfizer executives and top scientists from their groups going, oh, this is going to be great.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  Yeah, we've already done our own secret trials and we found that it will get rid of the immune systems.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  You'll need shots every few months, and they're like smiling about it.
[21:32.000 --> 21:41.000]  I've played those clips over and over again. They go on TV and bragged to each other.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  Remember the guy that wrote Obamacare? Forget his name.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  Jonathan Gruber. He went on C-SPAN and bragged.
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  Oh, no one could come up with a plan to deceive the boomers to sign on to Obamacare.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  So even though it tripled their prices, I wrote up a plan to lie and deceive them in Congress and we got it passed.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  And he's getting a standing ovation at a university.
[22:03.000 --> 22:10.000]  Well, he goes, I lied. I helped deceive. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's so good.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  He just had a lie.
[22:14.000 --> 22:20.000]  And Ezekiel Emanuel on Fox News going, Obamacare is going to bankrupt the economy.
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  We're going to take over and have cloward and pithen.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  I mean, he actually said that.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  He wasn't joking. They can't even help their hateful, nasty, disdain.
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  And now they're hitting us with a bio weapon and laughing at us.
[22:36.000 --> 22:43.000]  It's unbelievable. It's over the top. It's out of control.
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.000]  There's a little short boil down I found on Twitter. Follow the COVID vaccine money.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  More like follow the lies and flip-flopping and don't be like a goldfish.
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  You only have a seven second memory.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  Because remember, whatever Fauci said a month ago is going to be different today.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  But how did I predict years before how the lies will unfold?
[23:02.000 --> 23:10.000]  Because they write perspectives to their shareholders of why the stock's going up.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  They said there's a permanent global medical ID with shots every two months.
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000]  And they just keep building them up to get used to that. Here it is.
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  There's been over a 20 to one return.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  If you had put that money into an S&P 500 and reinvested the dividends
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  and come up with something like $17 billion, but you think it's $200 billion.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  Here, yeah.
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  You're okay. You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.000]  These vaccines are highly, highly effective.
[23:39.000 --> 23:43.000]  Vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  They're really, really good against variants.
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  Everyone who takes the vaccine is not just protecting themselves,
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.000]  but reducing their transmission to other people and allowing society to get back to normal.
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  Get your first shot, and when you're due for your second, get your second shot.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  Our key goal is to stop the transmission, to get the immunity levels up
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000]  so that you get almost no infection going on whatsoever.
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.000]  When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.000]  If you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized.
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.000]  You're not going to be an ICU unit, and you're not going to die.
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask.
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  Anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor and outdoor activities, large or small,
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  without wearing a mask or physical distancing.
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  But what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  You know, we didn't have vaccines that blocked transmission.
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  We got vaccines that helped you with your health, but they only slightly reduced the transmission.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  We need a new way of doing the vaccine.
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  The level of virus in the nasal pharynx of a person who's vaccinated and infected
[24:52.000 --> 24:59.000]  is the same level as the level of virus in the nasal pharynx of an unvaccinated person.
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  Reports from our international colleagues, including Israel,
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.000]  suggest increased risk of severe disease amongst those vaccinated early.
[25:08.000 --> 25:16.000]  And if you look at Israel, which has always been a month to a month and a half ahead of us,
[25:16.000 --> 25:24.000]  they are seeing a waning of immunity, not only against infection, but against hospitalizations
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  and to some extent death.
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.000]  But booster might actually be an essential part of the primary regimen that people should have.
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  The plan is for every adult to get a booster shot.
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  Clearly one of the best investments I've ever been involved in.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  Well, there you go.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  And of course, they'll try to block that on Twitter and Instagram saying it's edited deceptively.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  No, they said all that, they did all that, that's very accurate,
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  including the one where Gates says, I've made a 20 to 1 profit on vaccine investment.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  And he has.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  And the media goes, well, he's a philanthropist, he gave all his money away
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  to his own other foundations and other businesses that he owns.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  So he takes the money, it's tax free, he goes back into other companies,
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  gets it all back tax free and keeps investing in and calling it tax exempt,
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  saying it's a donation.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  Because he's an insider, they're in the club.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  He doesn't pay taxes, got it?
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.000]  He pays taxes when he buys a hamburger, sells tax, and he hates that, okay?
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  They're monsters, they're not like us.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  Let me just show you this again.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  Transparency, FDA wants 55 year delay to provide Pfizer COVID vaccine data.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  Boy, what's that tell you?
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  Now they want to give it to babies.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  Fauci said so, he's our boss, and then look at this,
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  vaccinated English adults under 60 are dying at twice the rate of unvaccinated people the same age.
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  This is from the British government's own official numbers, they can't even hide it,
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  it just keeps coming out everywhere.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  And same numbers are coming out worldwide.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  And also now we know when Pfizer suppressed this data,
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  in the live studies they've been doing on humans in the last year and a half.
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  Unbelievable.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  Unbelievable.
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.000]  Oh, but look, NIH director calls for COVID conspiracy theorist, conspiracist.
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.000]  Like, oh, conspiracist is in on, the word conspiracist is like you conspired to rob a bank,
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  or you conspired to cook up a virus and release to create fear,
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  and a lot of gene therapy that erases people's immune systems and gives them heart attacks.
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  But now those of us that are exposing their conspiracy, their criminal operation,
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  where the conspiracists see the inversion of reality.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  Global government, global ID, world force inoculation, doesn't protect you, erases your immune system,
[27:48.000 --> 27:55.000]  that's the real numbers, kills you at twice the rate of other people that didn't take it.
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.000]  And they want to arrest the conspiracists.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  Well, you know what, I'll take my chances with the arrest then.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  And yes, I know you're working around the clock to get me arrested and cook some up some charges.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  And oh, Jones doesn't get a jury trial and defamation suit.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  Guilty until proven guilty, period.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  Well, just decide how guilty you are.
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  And they brag.
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.000]  We want to silence him because this is an authoritarian takeover.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  They're going to attack on everybody and anybody fighting back is going to be under attack by the system.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  They weaponize the judiciary.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  They weaponize it all over the world.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  The police are attacking men, women and children who try to go outside.
[28:33.000 --> 28:41.000]  Oh, because of the virus that the very UN and very group taking over created and released on record.
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.000]  Oh, no, though, the head, the former head of the NIH, he wants everybody arrested.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  Oh, exposes you?
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  You're the one that's going to get arrested.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  You bet off more than you can chew.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  You got that?
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  You got it?
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  Okay.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  We're on a collision course.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  Glad you got it, son.

[30:15.000 --> 30:25.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[30:25.000 --> 30:32.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  But there is only two things to do.
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[30:47.000 --> 31:00.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life saving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[31:00.000 --> 31:12.000]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job. And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[31:12.000 --> 31:16.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good.
[31:16.000 --> 31:22.000]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew. You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[31:22.000 --> 31:29.000]  So I took it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[31:29.000 --> 31:36.000]  You know, I could think again. I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back.
[31:36.000 --> 31:41.000]  And I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. That's a break free of the globalist system.
[31:51.000 --> 31:55.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  I beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[32:00.000 --> 32:16.000]  I know you're humble. I know you're like me. But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and info wars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[32:16.000 --> 32:29.000]  And now as 2021 prepares to end at 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that you realize how important you are that you be more active than you've ever been.
[32:29.000 --> 32:35.000]  The tip of the sphere is band up. The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is info wars.com.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  And we can't stay on air without your support. So thank you all for your support.
[32:40.000 --> 32:49.000]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air and save info wars.com and save info wars.com and continue to go to info wars store.com.
[32:49.000 --> 33:10.000]  But right now we've got turbo force sold out for months, 10 hours of energy back in stock for free shipping, 40% off and so many other great products.
[33:19.000 --> 33:37.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:37.000 --> 33:58.000]  It's Sunday, November 21st and we're 33 minutes into this live original front line report. Well, Drew Hernandez is an investigative journalist and on the ground, theographer that we were already aware of previous to his amazing work in Kenosha.
[33:58.000 --> 34:11.000]  And of course we had a chance to work with him some, but he really was the star witness for written house other than written house himself. And his footage was the most powerful Elijah Shaffers, I would say was a close second.
[34:11.000 --> 34:27.000]  They both did an excellent job. A lot of other people did. And it's just those neutral eyes and ears there as humans, but also the electric guy documenting what really happened that didn't let MSM put written house in prison and all of our rights to self defense
[34:27.000 --> 34:42.000]  self defense in prison for life. But the fact is they still tried it and they censored. I was reviewing this last few days since the verdict. They censored so many people I mean they took bank accounts away from so many people we know that are
[34:42.000 --> 35:00.000]  journalists and their credit cards you name it for supporting written house. In fact, we got D bank kind of a big deal about it. Last year, again, we're supporting. Well, earlier this year for supporting written house. It was right after we had his mother on from their home.
[35:00.000 --> 35:14.000]  And it was two days later, bam. So, so I'm not here playing the victim. I'm saying this is tyranny. You hear about the red scare and some persecution of people that were communist. And I don't agree with that because once you persecute them, you'll get persecuted too.
[35:14.000 --> 35:23.000]  But this is thousands of times worse than that. And, you know, we think about discriminating against somebody for color they are is wrong and I agree with that.
[35:23.000 --> 35:32.000]  Well, then what about discrimination for your political beliefs your ideas but we're all vindicated but how many police officers.
[35:32.000 --> 35:41.000]  How many police officers lost their jobs for saying they supported call written house a lot. How many got fired.
[35:41.000 --> 36:02.000]  Because the left hacked into databases of this fundraiser and found who they were. These are terrorists. These are bullies. These are dangerous people and giving into them and backing down to them has gotten us the place we are where hordes and masses of mainly white
[36:02.000 --> 36:11.000]  pedophiles and methods but there's some black and Hispanic ones in there as well. I don't can't really ever see any Asians in there. I'm just being honest. They want to make everything racial. I'll talk about the racial group I'm seeing here.
[36:11.000 --> 36:19.000]  It's mainly flipped out virtue signaling Caucasian method devil worship or pedophile types, you know, Antifa, who are actually the fascist.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.000]  There's a few clips are going to do Hernandez to get his take. You know, after this is already sunk in since Friday.
[36:24.000 --> 36:35.000]  There's just a smattering of what's going on. You got MSNBC's saying that written house verdict is a warning to white BLM supporters that race traders can be shot.
[36:35.000 --> 36:44.000]  Total lie, total fraud, total garbage. Here's another one MSNBC's Tiffany Cross says written house is a quote little murderous white supremacist.
[36:44.000 --> 36:54.000]  There's another one crowd chance at Chicago. The only solution is communist revolution at Chicago's protest against the written house verdict.
[36:54.000 --> 37:03.000]  And we've got the people shooting guns into buildings and going crazy and burning things and we've got people marching saying they're going to get the white people in New York and all over the country.
[37:03.000 --> 37:16.000]  This type of crazy crap when it was mobs of people running around burning down section eight housing and blue collar car dealerships and small mom and pop gas stations.
[37:16.000 --> 37:26.000]  And people getting shot and people getting their jaws broken and, you know, cops out old black retired police officers out protecting somebody's store getting shot in the chest and dying.
[37:26.000 --> 37:33.000]  I mean, that's the real world that happened here, not the fantasy land. And I got to say, though, and then we're going to go to drill play these clips next segment.
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  It shocks me to a level that I can't even believe this.
[37:37.000 --> 37:47.000]  When I see that Soros funded prosecutor lying up there and trying to get witnesses to lie being caught basically when I believe crimes.
[37:47.000 --> 37:57.000]  And when I see the media worshiping and Hollywood stars calling the convicted five time child rapist nicknames like poor little Joe Joe.
[37:57.000 --> 38:07.000]  Some crazy pedophile running around screaming and attacking people and trying to stop written house from putting out fires.
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  I mean, this is satanic.
[38:11.000 --> 38:17.000]  So other Hernandez, thank you for joining us. I don't blame you not going up there for the verdict. It's so dangerous.
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  But wow, what do you make of the aftermath and what's your big takeaway from all this?
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  Alex, this is why info wars is always saying there is a war on for your mind.
[38:26.000 --> 38:33.000]  Literally, this was big tech and corporate media against independent media, the American people themselves.
[38:33.000 --> 38:42.000]  I say that because can you imagine if myself and other independent reporters that were there on the ground that had their footage used in the trial were not there?
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.000]  The reality would be that Kyle written house would be in prison right now if that footage did not exist.
[38:47.000 --> 38:59.000]  And we had to rely on the fake news media cartel narrative in Cahoots with big tech that Kyle written house was a white supremacist that showed up as an active shooter to shoot a bunch of black people.
[38:59.000 --> 39:06.000]  100% a lie from the pit of hell that never happened. Kyle written house did not shoot any black people.
[39:06.000 --> 39:17.000]  If anything, Kyle written house shot a white child rapist pedophile that was charging him from behind that was a threat to his life and he shot him in self defense.
[39:17.000 --> 39:23.000]  Joseph Rosenbaum was a child rapist. Joseph Rosenbaum was a child rapist. Joseph Rosenbaum was a child rapist.
[39:23.000 --> 39:37.000]  I'm going to say that over and over and over again, Alex. And here's why because you and I know how powerful you have the useful idiots with Disney, the Hollywood pedo elites that are literally standing side by side with Joseph Rosenbaum right now,
[39:37.000 --> 39:43.000]  which is not a surprise, but people should realize and open up their eyes that they are the ones that stand with their own.
[39:43.000 --> 39:51.000]  And there's a reason why these people are standing with Joseph Rosenbaum. Number one, because it was based off of a lie and these people stand with their own and they defend their own.
[39:51.000 --> 39:58.000]  This is a disgrace. Like you said, Alex, it's satanic. It's evil. But we literally have people calling for communist revolution.
[39:58.000 --> 40:08.000]  Black Lives Matter in Chicago over a child rapist because they think that he's a hero. He's not. He's not in any way, shape or form. It's a disgrace.
[40:08.000 --> 40:27.000]  Well, we have people that know he didn't cross state lines with a gun, that know he was there defending his dad's property, and they're up there knowingly even after everything comes out about Rittenhouse to say that he is a white supremacist out to murder white supporters of black people.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  I mean, they're definitely inciting violence against Rittenhouse is what's going on.
[40:32.000 --> 40:41.000]  Absolutely. Listen, conservatives, right wingers, you know, people are saying this isn't about race. This isn't about race. This is about race. And here's why.
[40:41.000 --> 40:52.000]  This is a strategic attack on white people. I'm not even white and this bothers me because this is wrong. It's evil. Just because you're white doesn't mean that you're evil and some kind of racist white supremacist.
[40:52.000 --> 41:03.000]  They ran with that with Kyle because they know there are millions of lemmings in the United States of America in the world that are just going to follow that, listen to that, not even question that and just believe that as if it's 100% gospel truth.
[41:03.000 --> 41:12.000]  Listen, there is an all out assault slander on white people right now with this critical race theory garbage. It all ties in together and it's a disgrace to this country.
[41:12.000 --> 41:23.000]  This is about race and it's not about race because Kyle made it about race. It's because the fake news media cartel manipulates the minds of millions of people to believe that this was a white supremacist.
[41:23.000 --> 41:30.000]  They make it about race. It's an attack on white people, Alex. And for the record, I'm not white. I'm Hispanic. I'm brown and this pisses me off too.
[41:30.000 --> 41:37.000]  Well, I mean, look, it's the ruling class trying to divide everybody. I mean, they're killing us all with inflation. They're destroying our country.
[41:37.000 --> 41:43.000]  They're trying to collapse us and you're out of our Bill of Rights and Constitution. It's a classic tactic. That's what the British Empire did in India.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  People say, well, Indians are all Indians. No, they're not. They're different. Some are Muslims. Some are Hindus. Some are Buddhists.
[41:48.000 --> 41:58.000]  It's regional fights and the British went in with less than 10,000 soldiers on average for hundreds of years and control everybody with sociology knowing which groups to play off against each other.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  That's all this is. It's called the great game.
[42:01.000 --> 42:13.000]  Absolutely. Saul Alinsky, right? Rules to radicals. The game plan as to what is to get people against each other, get two classes, pin them against each other, get them to hate each other, get them to destroy each other,
[42:13.000 --> 42:20.000]  get them to kill each other for who they are based off of a lie. That's exactly what's happening in the United States of America. We need to wake up to this.
[42:20.000 --> 42:31.000]  I saw Linsky dedicated his book to Lucifer, Satan himself. This is the playbook. It's demonic. It's satanic. They want us to kill each other, Alex. And we have to wake up to the reality.
[42:31.000 --> 42:39.000]  And we have to see that this is literally strategically planned to dismantle the United States of America. And it's happening. It's happening, Alex.
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.000]  Stay right there. Let's come back and talk about that and what you think is coming next and how we counter this.
[42:44.000 --> 42:51.000]  Again, we've got Drew Hernandez here as usual kicking butt. He's on Twitter at DrewHLive, DrewHLive.com as well.
[42:51.000 --> 43:17.000]  So, bookmark that. I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[46:26.000 --> 46:39.000]  This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarsstore.com.

[47:17.000 --> 47:33.000]  Drew Hernandez is a good friend of mine and he's also a hero because in a land of folks that have handed over their authority to the corrupt system and the corporate media, he is out there, not just in the case of Kenosha, but
[47:33.000 --> 47:53.000]  literally hundreds of times that I know of where he got game changing footage that absolutely went viral and woke the country up like the footage of them cramming the children illegally in the back of cars disappearing off to airports and no records of what their real names are being with them.
[47:53.000 --> 48:08.000]  In some cases, not with their parents. I mean, this is criminal activity, ladies and gentlemen. And without people like Drew out there and quite frankly infowars, magnifying it and being on the same story with him, that wouldn't have been out there.
[48:08.000 --> 48:20.000]  And in so many times, I look and who's the MVPs? It's a handful of us. And that's why I thank the listeners for keeping us on the field because without you, we wouldn't be here and the enemy would be winning right now.
[48:20.000 --> 48:36.000]  And that's what's crazy is that, you know, I got some calls the last few days by very prominent people, good people. And they just said, look, you're right about the whole world. And we were basically not able to deal with this because it's so shocking, but you're right.
[48:36.000 --> 48:50.000]  And we've got to take on the globalists and we got to stop them and we got to do it. And a lot of these are formerly liberal people who meant well but have been conned. And so the dam's breaking. The chain reaction is happening, but the system is panicking.
[48:50.000 --> 49:02.000]  And so the universities and all these systems are funded by big megabanks and taxpayers, but they're pushing communism because that's the system the globalist used to control China and so many other places.
[49:02.000 --> 49:20.000]  It's the mega rich funding that and using communism as a system to basically bring this country down. And Drew Hernandez mentioned this. Here's a video clip of it in Chicago. There's also a similar video out of New York where they're chanting saying that communist revolution is the only way. Here it is.
[49:32.000 --> 49:45.000]  That's right. We need communism. That's what we need. We need that. We need that. We need that.
[49:45.000 --> 50:01.000]  So the globalists cut off the food using covetous the cover cut off the jobs people are hungry and they tell me answers communism. But again the banks will sit offshore and manage America just like they did Russia and China today. Here's Tiffany cross.
[50:01.000 --> 50:08.000]  Again, this is part of the course what they're saying on CNN and MSNBC. Here's just one of any clips we've got.
[50:08.000 --> 50:22.000]  I find these people disgusting early. I'm disgusted at what I'm saying. It's not just this trial. It's other trials. But this in particular the fact that white supremacists roam the halls of Congress freely and celebrate this little murderous white supremacist and the fact that he gets to walk the streets freely.
[50:22.000 --> 50:29.000]  It lets you know these people have access to instituting laws. They represent that legislative branch of this country. What are we to make of that?
[50:29.000 --> 50:48.000]  Welcome to the modern Republican Party. This is what these people want. And this is what a majority of white people vote for. When I say that a majority of white people are in favor of this kind of violence, it is because a majority of white people consistently vote Republican.
[50:48.000 --> 51:05.000]  I can't listen anymore, but turn it off. This is MSNBC. This is some of the biggest, most powerful corporations in the world telling you the revolutionaries with a bunch of people calling people white supremacists because they don't want their neighborhoods burned down by child molesters.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  Drew Hernandez.
[51:07.000 --> 51:24.000]  Alex, this is literally what they want. What they do is they politicize these things in order to radicalize their base. Now, here's an example. Shortly after the verdict was was literally issued to the entire world by a jury. Kyle Rittenhouse was found by a jury.
[51:24.000 --> 51:40.000]  Okay, to be not guilty. He acted in self-defense. Shortly after, midget Jerry Nadler says justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment protected protest.
[51:40.000 --> 51:51.000]  The only problem with that statement, Alex, is that there was nobody protesting in Kenosha on night one, two and three. It was a riot. The First Amendment does not cover riots.
[51:51.000 --> 51:54.000]  It doesn't cover burning down businesses and shooting people?
[51:54.000 --> 52:02.000]  It does not. It does not in any way, shape or form. But what I'm trying to show people is they use the verbiage in order for people to think that what he's saying is true.
[52:02.000 --> 52:14.000]  They actually believe that Kyle showed up to shoot protesters and then they go with that and they take to the streets and they defend child rapists like Joseph Rosenbaum in the middle of the streets calling for a communist revolution.
[52:14.000 --> 52:23.000]  People need to wake the hell up. These people are lying to you. They are lying to your face because they do not care about you because they want to control you.
[52:23.000 --> 52:29.000]  When you have somebody that's peddling a lie to your brain, that is somebody that wants to control how you think.
[52:29.000 --> 52:39.000]  That's exactly what these deep state globalists do. And Jerry Nadler is trying to say that Kyle Rittenhouse went after peaceful protesters to use and exercise their First Amendment right.
[52:39.000 --> 52:50.000]  And that is justification for the DOJ to go after Kyle Rittenhouse now. This is the lie. There's no case for that, Alex. No case whatsoever. It is all political.
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.000]  They politicize this because they use their power. They abuse their power to go after their political opponents.
[52:56.000 --> 53:05.000]  That's right. And now, since they've been caught lying all these years, they're just doubling down with bigger lies instead of stopping the lying, which makes more of the public wake up against them so they only intensify.
[53:05.000 --> 53:13.000]  They're never going to give up. How do you think this all ends? That's question number two. But the first question, I should have said this up front. You're alluding to it.
[53:13.000 --> 53:20.000]  That's the show headline tonight. Biden's DOJ may bring federal charges against Rittenhouse after show trial collapse.
[53:20.000 --> 53:29.000]  And to do that, they have surrogates of the puppet president and they have Nadler, as you just mentioned, himself saying, they need to do this.
[53:29.000 --> 53:40.000]  So absolutely insane. And I guess the political FBI, even though it'll blow up in their face, they'll follow orders. I wouldn't be surprised if the Justice Department doesn't indict Kyle Rittenhouse.
[53:40.000 --> 53:57.000]  Absolutely. I mean, think about it, Alex. What's the bigger picture here? Who's the one? Who's the one with the biggest microphone that literally used Kyle Rittenhouse's image as a poster boy for white supremacy as he was running for president on the campaign trail in 2020?
[53:57.000 --> 54:04.000]  It was Brandon. It was Joe Biden. It was him. Is Joe Biden fearing Kyle Rittenhouse suing him for defamation?
[54:04.000 --> 54:17.000]  And now he's going to sick the DOJ on Kyle because he knows the writing is on the wall because he's literally responsible using the biggest microphone in the nation to paint this kid, defame this kid, slander this kid of being a white supremacist.
[54:17.000 --> 54:28.000]  I don't know. It could be true, Alex. I'm just speculating here, but it would not surprise me if the answer to that question is yes. Kyle Rittenhouse has no hardcore far right right wing political history.
[54:28.000 --> 54:38.000]  The kid wanted to be a police officer. The kid wanted to be an AMT. The kid was looking to live a noble life. He had nothing to do with Trump, nothing to do with to do with right wing politics.
[54:38.000 --> 54:47.000]  The kid just wanted to live his life and he got sucked into this and they politicized it because it was a black lives matter riot. That's what made this political.
[54:47.000 --> 55:01.000]  That's right. They want black lives matter and antifa to be these brown shirts who can run around burning, attacking and killing whoever they want to intimidate America into submission and to intimidate the police into taking a knee and even laying on their bellies to them.
[55:01.000 --> 55:12.000]  Remember, that was done all over the country. But notice the whole spell that Soros and MSM put over us because we didn't like seeing what happened to George Floyd is now evaporated.
[55:12.000 --> 55:27.000]  Alex, people could go look at my Twitter right now. Go to Drew H. Live right now. I posted up the clip. There are literal NPC talking heads on MSNBC saying they allow Drew Hernandez to be a fact witness.
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.000]  Yeah, because I am. I'm an eyewitness. I have hundreds of body cam footage to show.
[55:32.000 --> 55:37.000]  He thinks pedophiles should be allowed to riot and attack people.
[55:37.000 --> 55:51.000]  Alex, they were saying he said antifa. He used the word antifa as if I was lying. I have the body cam footage antifa was there in Kenosha rioting, instigating the whole thing alongside with the black lives matter militants.
[55:51.000 --> 56:00.000]  People don't want the truth coming out. Even when I was testifying Alex under oath, I testified under oath that antifa was there rioting and I have the body cam footage.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  That's what they do.
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  When we come out and say they're going to.
[56:05.000 --> 56:13.000]  Exactly. When we come out and say they want a world government force inoculation, then it comes true. We need to be arrested according to the NIH for pointing out what's true.
[56:13.000 --> 56:18.000]  Everybody knows Antifa's there. Everybody knows MSNBC said Antifa's good hundreds of times.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  But now you're not even supposed to say they exist, Drew. That's just crazy.
[56:22.000 --> 56:31.000]  Absolutely, because they want their lie to thrive. They don't want people to know the truth. And listen, I don't care what your politics are.
[56:31.000 --> 56:41.000]  I know I say this over and over and over and over again, whether you're on the left or the right. If somebody is lying to you, that is the most offensive thing someone could ever do.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  Why would you want to listen to someone that is lying to your face?
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.000]  Oh, no, Drew, you're the hard right winger that's lying to me. Am I really? Why don't you study for yourself?
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  And I'm speaking to people that are watching this that are just literally not thinking for themselves.
[56:53.000 --> 57:02.000]  You have to think for yourself. You have to discover for yourself. You have to educate yourself. Do not allow the federal government be the one who thinks for you.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  Is it really that hard, Alex?
[57:04.000 --> 57:14.000]  You're absolutely right. Drew, do five more minutes with us because I want to ask you where you think this goes and what we should all be doing to promote our own right to self-defense.
[57:14.000 --> 57:21.000]  So it is a victory that despite all their propaganda and all their disinfo and all they're trying to influence the jury, the truth won this time.
[57:21.000 --> 57:31.000]  But you should never have been on trial to begin with. Everybody's been saying that from Tucker Carlson to you to Mike Stern, but you're in studio on Friday.
[57:31.000 --> 57:41.000]  And that's really what it is. Hour number two coming up, Robert Barnes is going to respond to Rittenhouse and the big vaccine mandates that are so criminal and more next hour than Owen Schreuer comes in.
[57:41.000 --> 58:03.000]  Big second hour straight ahead, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. The globalists. If you only knew the power of the dark side, join Bill Gates and together we will defeat humanity.
[58:03.000 --> 58:22.000]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life. That's basically the ethos of the globalists. They must first play God. They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[58:22.000 --> 58:35.000]  And in a way, they're right. If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open, we really deserve what's happened to us.
[58:35.000 --> 58:45.000]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the dual order even more? I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[58:45.000 --> 58:52.000]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[59:16.000 --> 59:26.000]  Both the regular shows and special reports and share them with everyone you know. Take action now by texting the word news, NEWS, to 833-470-0438.
[59:26.000 --> 59:38.000]  That's 833-470-0438 for infowars emergency news alerts or text the word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[59:38.000 --> 59:46.000]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts. Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  The Alex Jones show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  Alright, here's my final question for Drew Hernandez.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  And he can make any other points you'd like to, but we see these videos coming out so much that I don't even really ever play them on the show because there's hundreds a day that I can look at.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  I just can't help but see for six a day. Shots fired at flash mob, raids Nordstroms in uphill California town.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  So now once things, then you start getting raiders or just pirating.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  And then the people start fighting with each other and shooting at each other.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  You're not going to hear a word about this on the mainstream news, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  And this is just the breakdown of civilization and society.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  And we also, again, so-called victims call written house, shot, pedophile, woman, beater and domestic abuser and self-defense.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  You have the media defending that again. This is really the Democrats becoming the party of evil.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  And you've got Mark Ruffalo saying, you know, what a wonderful person Rosenbaum wise.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  And that's just not the truth.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  When you'll publicly defend child molesters, you've got a serious, serious, serious problem.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  You're talking about the same Jojo. That's his nickname that rapes little boys and uses the n-word.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  What the hell is wrong with you, Mark?
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Oh, no, they that's what Hollywood is a satanic, spiritual, vampiric, pedophile, command base through Hernandez.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Your take on that.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Alex, you know, I'll just say this is it. It reminds me a lot when Trump won in 2016.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  I know it was a massive celebration, but I think you and I both know that we immediately realized that the deep state was going to retaliate immediately.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  And here's why the little guy is not supposed to win. The American people are not supposed to win.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  Kyle Rittenhouse was the little guy. He was supposed to lose the deep state, the globalists, that cabal, they didn't want him to win.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  They wanted to put him in jail forever, make an example out of him so they could scare every single gun owner from defending themselves in the future ever again,
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  or even scare anybody from attempting to purchase a firearm for the purpose of self-defense ever again.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  That wasn't supposed to happen, Alex. So we know that the deep state will retaliate.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  This is probably why the DOJ is about to mobilize against Kyle Rittenhouse and probably everybody involved.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  I mean, I'm pretty sure my name is obviously already out there. I'm preparing. I'm getting myself prepared for what's to come.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  But listen, we have to be on guard. We have to know that God is with us. We can't allow these people to intimidate us.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  We can't allow these people to put us in a position where we are afraid to stand up for truth, justice, and righteousness,
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  because if we do, that is how they win, OK? We are in a place in American history where they expect us to bend the knee
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  because we're dealing with serious tyranny, which is not a conspiracy theory, and we are going to stand up against it.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  And this is a perfect example of that. So my prediction is there will be a deep state retaliation
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  because people like Kyle Rittenhouse, the American people, the little guy like you and me, Alex, are not supposed to get a W like this.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  And here's the reason why as well, because they don't want their lemmings, the millions of people that they control to see
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  that the little guy could still win in the end. They want in their minds, OK, this is what the deep state wants.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  The deep state wants in the minds of millions of people that they control, that there is nobody that is more powerful
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  or that could defeat them ever. And Kyle Rittenhouse just did. So this is why there will be a retaliation.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  And we will see what that looks like, Alex.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Well, Drew Hernandez works for multiple different journalistic organizations.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  But I got to say, you are a really smart person and a great talk show host and a lot better than most of the stuff we see on Fox News.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  So it's good to know you. And I want to go to sleep at night with my four children.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  It's good to know there are real men like you out there, Drew.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  So for everybody at M4 Wars, we love you and we appreciate you.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Everybody can find more of what you do on your website, drewhlive.com and at drewhlive.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  Drew, thank you so much.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  Likewise, Alex. Thank you.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  Thank you, buddy. That's what it's going to take guys like that right there.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  That's the future of the world if we want to have a future.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  It's been like that. Wow.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  So we're going to come back on the other side with Robert Barnes to talk about the cutting edge of the fight against the vaccine tyranny inside the Rittenhouse jury selection that he was involved in and then also so much more.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  We'll also talk about the unprecedented destruction of the right of the trial by jury by the Democratic Party operative judges against yours truly.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  Now that's going to be used as a pretext because everybody else, the right back stay with us.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are working for, quote, dark forces.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  The FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  And Moderna is in trouble as well. They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons, but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  And so people are waking up.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  The weapons work a little too good.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead they're making too big of a noise. But it's too late for a return back now.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  They're coming after our children. So it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  Remember, God is watching.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  Well, a lot of people tell me their favorite guest on the show is Robert Barnes. He doesn't just know the law.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  He's also quite the historian. We got to cover the waterfront in this hour.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  We got left before going takes over with Sunday Live for two hours of live Sunday transmission as well.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  The reason I've been doing a Sunday show, not just a weekday show for now 14 years is a lot of stuff happens on the weekend.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  And there's a lot of people tuning in. That's why I started doing Saturday shows.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  That's why we started doing the Sunday show 14 years ago.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  So I'm going to start doing a nighttime just calling show that's basically going to only have like two, three minutes of breaks an hour.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  So we can just, you know, join some stations that want to carry it.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  So in the face of all this tearing these historic times, I am turning up the heat on the New World Order.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  I want to get into the written house trial first, then the latest because Barnes is involved with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  He's about to file a major suit. He's already filed a whole bunch in Texas where Pfizer suppressed the deaths.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  Remember, he told you about that a month ago that was coming out.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Two weeks later, it came out and he's the lawyer at the tip of the spear on that.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  So that's a big, big deal. But he also, again, ran much of the jury selection on the written house trial.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  So we'll talk about that first. But let me hit this little caveat in this segment and then we'll come back with the written house stuff.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  Here's a little folder from this week.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  It's been a lot of time on it, but I am now a few minutes. Alex Jones is guilty. That's just this file.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  And this is only a fraction of the thousands, thousands.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  You can go to Google News and type this in and you'll see 3,000 results in the News column.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  Alex Jones is guilty. Alex Jones found guilty.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Salon.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  Yes, editorial. At long last, Alex Jones is held to account.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  Alex Jones conspiracy theorist releases video begging for money after being found guilty in Sandy Hook cases, London Independent.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  I love that they took a screenshot of me with my eyes closed. I mean, it's just every level of sophistic garbage.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Alex Jones found guilty by default. At least they told the truth in this article. L.A. Times.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  On and on and on and on and on. Alex Jones found guilty in all four defamation cases.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Yahoo News. Alex Jones found guilty.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Conspiracy theorist loses fourth lawsuit, found guilty. Alex Jones found guilty. Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  On and on and on. Guilty, guilty, guilty. Conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones found guilty.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  BW.com. That's the national German TV biggest channel.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  All over the world, folks, Connecticut judge orders and forwards Alex Jones to pay damages to families of Sandy Hook shooting victims in defamation lawsuits.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  The current. You've got them all out there giving their press conferences and just loving themselves.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  I mean, talk about where Butthead went to go work. That's actually his Butthead right there.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Get rid of the First Amendment. Down the guns, too.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  Alex Jones liable for damages. On and on and on. London Guardian.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  Now, there it is. I mean, Rolling Stone goes on for hours and hours. No jury.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  And it's not true that we didn't turn over the information. Just all not true.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  And the total proof is Owen Schreuer was never subpoenaed or never deposed in the Texas cases.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Never called and then they defaulted him. How do you do that?
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  So I wanted to just mention here that they're very angry and they're very upset.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  That we would then after them trying to deplatform us and debank us and all the harassment, all the defamation.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Oh, he finally is being paid back for questioning a mass shooting that the Internet questioned
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  because of very interesting anomalies that we have a right to question.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  I'm not calling a young man a white supremacist and saying he carried guns across state lines to kill people.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  He needs to be killed like mainstream news. And once they have the Alex Jones exception,
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  that's why some of the Republican Party is actually behind these suits with the Democrats.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  We know that we're not dumb. That'll come out and we're ready to release it.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  They're going to use this to shut everybody's speech down.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  So yeah, I don't like them saying these defamatory things about Kyle because they can get him killed.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Everything they've accused me of, they're actually doing. And it's the anti-gun lobby that's after Kyle
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  because they don't want you to be able to defend yourself.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  So the same groups that the bankrupted Remington that are trying to sue us into oblivion
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  are bragging and telling us and telling the world we want to silence Alex Jones.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  That's villainous. I didn't make my career our Sandy Hook. They did.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  I heard Labor talked about it and they know that, but they want to set up dead kids against Alex Jones.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  So Owen raised over $200,000 for his legal defense. It will cost at least that.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  They're trying to put him in jail for years and years for being at the Capitol.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  It will cost conservatively to fight it through trial.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Half a million dollars. That's what inflation is with any decent lawyers now.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  He's raised 200 something thousand. That's great.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  But I noticed when we did his fundraiser, almost no money came in at infowarstore.com for those days.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  So I said, okay, hold it. You got enough for now.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  We got to get the rest of the money to pay the crew and everything else.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Same thing happened here.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Infowarsstore.com, since I plugged this on Thursday and Friday, had its sales cut in more than half.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  And I'm not complaining at listeners, but when I said saveinfowars.com gives and go
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  to try to raise $2 million, we have six different defamation since we got a fight in the next year,
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  starting in March, running through fall.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  And you'll just don't go to them. They'll arrest me.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  I have to go sit there in a kangaroo court, not be able to talk and be lying about it,
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  and be pillory, but that's okay.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  I'm lucky they didn't just kill me like JFK or somebody, or try to put Owen in prison.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  I mean, this is their play. This is what they're doing.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  We have to go through it and just preserve the record for appeal, whatever.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Keep fighting. They're already pissed we've been fighting them three plus years.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  But what I noticed is when we get donations there at saveinfowars.com,
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  it's the same great people that are buying products to keep us on air.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  They just don't buy the product. They go over and they make a donation.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  And that tells me that it's middle class and blue collar people giving the money,
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  and not all the nouveau rich that are going to lose every damn penny you got.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  If you don't get off the bench and come in for the fight.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  So I love our listeners. Thanks for the financial support.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  It's for your free speech as well. We are the tip of the damn spear.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  So I need you to go to saveinfowars.com.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And look, I'm not complaining, but we've raised $170,000.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  Okay, can we go to saveinfowars.com?
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  I want to show folks on screen.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  And if you go there, that's 8% of the goal we need.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  I'm fighting the Democratic Party.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  $2 million will give us the budget we need in the next year.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  I mean, help just the two weeks of my divorce trial and custody battle cost me $300,000.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  And I'm not bitching, but that was all brought for political reasons
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  and covered by the media for political reasons.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  I'm just saying you want this dog in the fight, you want this dog in the hind.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  I will never betray you. I will never back down.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  I will never surrender, but I could give out.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  So they want to capture us.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  They want to take us over.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  They want to have us just like capture the flag.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  Okay, because they know we're the epicenter.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  If I told you behind the scenes, my phones are tapped.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  The enemy knows the level of influential stuff we have.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  It's not just Bolsonaro listening every day.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  It's not just it's everybody and I'm not bragging,
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  but we've reached through God incredible levels where extremely,
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  you know, cutting edge, most popular people say,
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  all right, actually, you know, you're the general.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  What do we do?
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  And that is not a power trip for me.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  That is a great responsibility now where people are like,
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  oh, he's right a lot.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  He's kind of eccentric, you know, kind of an idiot, savant.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Yeah, but still he's a little out of it, which I am.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  I'm just like you.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  I'm a regular person, but I've been given the gift of understanding this
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  and you've all been given gifts as well that God gave us to fight these people.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  And Info Wars is hitting its absolute crime right now.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  We are entering what we were made for.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  We were built for it together.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  So I need you to go to infowarstore.com and get t-shirts, get books,
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  get great supplements, get great coffee, get great films.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Infowarstore.com, store right free shipping going right now,
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  double patriot points, turbo force back in stock 40% off.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  So many other great products.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  But the big thing is the donations because if I spend $2 million on these defenses this year,
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  I just sold my house and I'm using that money to actually fight harder
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  and get more reporters and do more events and make more films
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  and you see everything we're doing.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  I need that money from the house sale to up our attack in the Info War.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  I do not need it to sit there and run this defense operation.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  So this is what it is.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  It's a rearguard action just holding off the globalists while they chew through the wall.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  I'll use the final Matrix movie analogy where the machines are drilling in to get everybody
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  and the Nios up there in the Matrix crime beat the whole game
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  before they get everybody in Zion.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  That's basically an analogy.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  It's like big drillers going,
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  I'm trying to man the guns and fight the big globalist operations
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  and coming for our children and everything else that's happening.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Meanwhile, they've got this driller coming through right here.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  We've got to hold the drillers back and then by then it'll be way too late.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  Probably already is.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  Folks, we are just devastating the enemy.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  Devastating their ass.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  I am so freaking happy.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  I am so fired up.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  I just want to stay in the game, folks.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Just give me the ball.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Just give me the ball.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  And you give me the ball by going to saveinfowars.com.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Give me the ball.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Give me the ball.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  And the fighting is the new order.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  We're not bragging here, folks, but Infowars is the greatest of all time.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  All of us together.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  We'll be back.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  All of us who have awoken from the spell,
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  we know this is all really happening
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  But there is only two things to do.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  What are champions made of?
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  Here's a man who can show you.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  Is the Infowars Store hotline?
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:18:03.880]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:09.040]  pills, and look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible
[1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:15.840]  downsides, horrible crashes, and again, so many toxins in them.
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:22.280]  All of the Neutropic products that we sell at InfoWarStore.com are clean, are pure, are

[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:15.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:15.360 --> 1:20:21.080]  Our guests, we're going to talk about the Rittenhouse Trial of the Century Self-Defense
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:27.960]  on the chopping block, but for now reprieve, but this is breaking.
[1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:35.040]  There's a parade shooting, car running into people, reports, and I guess this is out of
[1:20:35.040 --> 1:20:41.120]  Wacushev, I'm saying that right, Wacasha, Wisconsin police say they are having an emergency
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:45.320]  with a scene unfolding in response to Twitter reports of a car running through the city's
[1:20:45.320 --> 1:20:48.920]  Christmas parade and shots being fired.
[1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:51.800]  They always say it's a Muslim, it's a Christian convert.
[1:20:51.800 --> 1:20:56.080]  People told Heavy.com that their loved ones were barricaded in the stores after a vehicle
[1:20:56.080 --> 1:21:00.560]  drove through the crowd with someone firing gunshots from it.
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:04.680]  So let's hope and pray that there's not too many hurt or killed or anybody hurt or killed.
[1:21:04.680 --> 1:21:06.960]  Now going to Robert Barnes, thanks for coming on.
[1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:09.600]  You've been a very busy man, you're going to be in studio with us in about a week and
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:10.600]  a half.
[1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:14.240]  Got some big things going down in Texas, but let's get into Colorado Rittenhouse right
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:16.120]  now.
[1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:20.720]  You know that incident in Wacushev, Wisconsin is right up the road from Kenosha, is about
[1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:24.160]  a half an hour or so from Kenosha, it's a suburb of Milwaukee.
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:28.040]  So I wonder if it's correlated, I mean there was a lot of threats made, death threats made
[1:21:28.040 --> 1:21:33.040]  against Kyle, the Portland and Tifa was making them over the weekend.
[1:21:33.040 --> 1:21:38.520]  So you know, due to the media's constant barrage of lies about Kyle, I mean this case
[1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:44.520]  was about whether self-defense exists in America because if they could convict Kyle in Kenosha,
[1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:49.080]  nobody had self-defense rights left and it was about the corruption of the press and
[1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:53.600]  the corruption of the politicians and the corruption of the prosecutors combined to
[1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:58.920]  collude to deny justice in America, to deny self-defense in America, to deny the Second
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:00.360]  Amendment in America.
[1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:04.720]  And fortunately the good people of Kenosha, good working class community, long standing
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:10.240]  working class community stood up and said no to the corrupt press, no to the corrupt
[1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:15.640]  politicians, no to the corrupt prosecutors and found him not guilty of all charges because
[1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:18.440]  he was always not guilty of all charges.
[1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:24.520]  He was an innocent kid who was only prosecuted because of the corrupt prosecutors, the corrupt
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:29.240]  press and the corrupt politicians and they even were trying to coordinate and coerce
[1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:34.240]  the jury into a different outcome by announcing the National Guard was coming in by closing
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:38.520]  down schools around the system by allowing protesters an ear shot and eye shot of the
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:42.800]  court of the jury during the liberations, demanding that there be guilty verdicts or
[1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:46.040]  there would be quote repercussions, quote consequences.
[1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:47.840]  I don't know if that's what we're seeing in Washington.
[1:22:47.840 --> 1:22:52.360]  And then tie that into my cases where the judges work in concert to default us, which
[1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:56.880]  is saying we didn't give them anything, that's not true, and then they default, oh and again
[1:22:56.880 --> 1:23:01.760]  without even ever sending him a letter or asking for anything, how do you not give people
[1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:04.640]  what they asked for when they asked for nothing?
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:05.640]  Well your case is extraordinary.
[1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:09.240]  It's a case where there's, you know, there's an Alex Jones exception now to the protection
[1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:10.240]  of the First Amendment.
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:13.960]  There's an Alex Jones exception to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and
[1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:19.280]  now there's a Alex Jones exception to the right to a jury trial in the Seventh Amendment,
[1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:23.000]  which is protected under state law under its own analog provisions in both Connecticut
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  and Texas.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  This is extraordinary.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:28.160]  The sanction that was issued is called the death penalty sanction for a reason and it
[1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:32.320]  has never been applied in a case like yours ever, just like there's never been a defamation
[1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:36.080]  case found in a case like yours ever, just like there's never been an intentional affliction
[1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:40.760]  of a most of distress claim allowed in a case like yours ever, just like there's never been
[1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:45.040]  a denial of basic rights to pursue motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:46.160]  as happened in your case.
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:51.260]  It is a complete railroading and it looks like 19th century Australia, all railroads
[1:23:51.260 --> 1:23:52.640]  in kangaroos.
[1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:57.240]  And that process, the court system itself still doesn't recognize that it is on trial
[1:23:57.240 --> 1:24:02.640]  in these cases and it continues to come up guilty, failing to provide basic elemental
[1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:06.640]  first, fourth, fifth and seventh amendment protections that are protected under analog
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:09.160]  provisions of the state constitutions as well.
[1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:12.320]  And this is dangerous because they're trying to create an exception to the First Amendment
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:13.800]  for speech they don't like.
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:17.120]  They're trying to undermine support for the Second Amendment.
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:20.560]  They're trying to create an exception to due process of law, trying to create an exception
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:22.440]  to the right to a trial by jury.
[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:26.800]  If they were right, I mean they were in liberal jurisdictions in Connecticut, liberal jurisdictions
[1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:31.600]  in Austin, Texas, and they were still terrified that a jury would not rule their way.
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:36.040]  If I was on their side and I thought I was right, I would want a jury to affirm it.
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:38.120]  I would want a jury to confirm it.
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:42.680]  They were scared that the actual facts of the case would not be found to be on their
[1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:48.600]  side by an actual jury, even a liberal democratic jury and liberal democratic jurisdictions
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:54.800]  that have been rampaged by false media stories about this case and about you for going on
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:55.800]  a better part of that.
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:01.160]  And how do I even get a fair default hearing from a jury if you're guilty until proven
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:05.520]  how guilty when they're saying he is guilty, finally he's guilty.
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:08.200]  Now the hero jury will shut his speech down.
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:10.440]  They're actually, it's like so villainous.
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:12.080]  It's like cartoon level.
[1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:16.520]  Ed, there's no doubt and this effort is really an effort to shut down your speech, to shut
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:20.840]  down other people's speech that is of a like mind, to shut down people raising questions
[1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:22.720]  about the institutional narrative.
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:25.720]  People still don't fully appreciate the legal theory they're pursuing.
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:29.800]  The legal theory isn't about factually false statements made about a specific individual.
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:33.960]  It is, you go back and listen to the questions that were asked in your deposition in Texas.
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:37.360]  It was, you're not allowed to challenge the institutional narrative.
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:41.240]  You're not allowed to challenge the government narrative and if somebody is upset or offended
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:45.320]  by your challenging that narrative, you can now be bankrupted and busted and have your
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:48.860]  entire operation shut down under the guise of a civil suit.
[1:25:48.860 --> 1:25:53.920]  This is exactly what the racists were doing in the 1960s that led to the Sullivan decision
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:55.920]  in 1964 in the first place.
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:26:00.640]  They were misusing and abusing local judicial process, corrupt press, corrupt politicians
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:05.240]  combining and conspiring and colluding with various prejudice groups within the community
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:07.960]  to try to suppress dissident speech they didn't like.
[1:26:07.960 --> 1:26:09.880]  The challenge shared institutional narratives.
[1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:10.880]  This is the same thing.
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:13.480]  We're re-experiencing it all over again.
[1:26:13.480 --> 1:26:15.400]  And Bob, let's tie that together.
[1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:20.520]  NIH director calls for COVID conspiracy theorist and conspiracist like we're involved in a
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:22.360]  crime to be brought to justice.
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:24.640]  This is the guy running the wool on lab with Fauci.
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:28.120]  He's the one that should be arrested, but he's up there with two masks on his Kabuki
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  theater.
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:32.440]  And what you just said with Kyle, it's get rid of the self-defense.
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:34.640]  With Alex Jones, it's get rid of the free speech.
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:36.440]  And with this guy, it's the same thing.
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:40.600]  Shut us up so we can't defend ourselves as the wheels come off with the fact that this
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:43.240]  isn't a vaccine, it's deadly.
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:47.320]  And combine that with the Pfizer CEO coming out and saying that anybody who disagrees
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:49.440]  with Pfizer should be considered a criminal.
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:54.280]  And this is Pfizer, the biggest criminally-fined drug company in the history of the world.
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:57.120]  That's who is declaring that other people need to be called criminals.
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:02.800]  I represent a primary whistleblower who exposed information about what Pfizer was doing, about
[1:27:02.800 --> 1:27:04.840]  what they were doing in their clinical trials.
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:09.040]  That information, I am sure, is part of the FOIA request that have been made to the FDA
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:11.200]  and to CDC and the NIH.
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:13.000]  And what is the FDA saying?
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.760]  They're saying they can't disclose those records for 70 years.
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:19.760]  They have to, they can't let anybody know what's in those records.
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:20.760]  Why?
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:25.320]  Because if you dig into those records, you will find that the FDA knew about serious
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:29.560]  problems with the clinical test and other issues with these vaccines that you've been
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:34.640]  detailing and documenting and all of the collapsing athletes all across the world that can almost
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:38.960]  only be explained by the vaccine's introduction around the world.
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:42.680]  So this is part of a combined effort that the only way the institutional powers can
[1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:48.520]  stay in power is to be able to never have to disclose information that is lawfully required
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:54.680]  to be disclosed, to suppress dissidents from having any speech rights, and if you try to
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:58.240]  protect yourself with self-defense, to suppress that as well.
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:02.240]  And it's the corruption of the press, the corruption of the politicians trying to corrupt
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:03.640]  our judicial process.
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:08.320]  And here what's happening is judges are so scared of a jury verdict, like what a jury
[1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:13.560]  found in Kyle's case, that they're not willing to give a jury the same rights that every
[1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:17.360]  individual is entitled to, except apparently Alex Jones.
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:23.400]  And the arrogance of these people just across the board, the judicial tyranny, and what
[1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:27.760]  leftist lawyers are doing is just going to destroy them politically.
[1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:33.160]  I don't see where this leads in any good way for these people because their war on our
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:34.400]  freedom is failing.
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:38.720]  It's only waking people up, folks, I can tell you right now across the board, Robert Barnes
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:39.720]  is our guest.
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:42.720]  I want to go back to Rittenhouse and let Yves Perdix is going to come out of this next.
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:46.360]  We'll the Justice Department indict him as they're making noises of and more.
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:50.960]  And then the big case he's going to file coming up soon in Texas against Pfizer and others.
[1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:57.040]  We'll be right back, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[1:28:57.040 --> 1:28:58.240]  Let's see you.
[1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:01.080]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:05.600]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:11.360]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:15.040]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:20.000]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.200]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:27.760]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:31.160]  That's why everybody should visit infowarsstore.com.
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:38.440]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in America products that have 100% reviews
[1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:39.440]  and are simply incredible.
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:41.120]  It's a 360 win.
[1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:45.960]  Protect your privacy and shop at infowars to support the overall info war against the
[1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:46.960]  globalists.
[1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:48.640]  A true 360 win.
[1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:58.360]  Get your Faraday cages at infowarsstore.com, check out the new line, it's amazing.
[1:29:58.360 --> 1:30:04.320]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:30:04.320 --> 1:30:08.840]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out and they're doing that not because
[1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:14.400]  we're weak but because we're made the image of God, the Creator and we are powerful and
[1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:17.080]  the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:30:17.080 --> 1:30:21.440]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:25.240]  with the boy, is it true?
[1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:31.080]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:34.920]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[1:30:34.920 --> 1:30:41.600]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:43.400]  of this world who is a loser.
[1:30:43.400 --> 1:30:47.280]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever
[1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:51.760]  because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:56.560]  up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they
[1:30:56.560 --> 1:30:57.560]  just announced.
[1:30:57.560 --> 1:31:04.200]  I know you're humble, I know you're like me but I really want you to sit back and cogitate
[1:31:04.200 --> 1:31:10.960]  or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and info wars
[1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:13.800]  over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:23.040]  And now as 2021 prepares to end and 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that
[1:31:23.040 --> 1:31:27.160]  you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[1:31:27.160 --> 1:31:29.400]  The tip of the spear is band.billion.

[1:33:01.120 --> 1:33:17.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:17.240 --> 1:33:22.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, we now take you live to the central Texas
[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:28.320]  Command Center and the heart of the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:36.320]  And Robert Barnes, walk a shop, parade shooting, car running into people reports and now local
[1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:42.680]  news is reporting mass casualty event, we can put that back on screen in a minute, mass
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:47.880]  casualty event up to 30 people run down.
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:50.920]  And the bigger question is, well they now say banned cars, well actually they're talking
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:55.600]  about making you have driverless cars so people can't use cars as weapons, no, you don't blame
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:34:01.480]  the car, you blame the person, you don't blame the baseball bat, you blame the person using
[1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:03.680]  the baseball bat improperly.
[1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:07.360]  So we hope that it's not as bad as a lot of these reports coming out of local news are
[1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:08.360]  saying.
[1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:13.160]  Robert Barnes, any comments on this then let's segue back into Rittenhouse and the Justice
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:16.800]  Department and whether you think they're actually going to be crazy enough to indict him again
[1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:17.800]  this time federally.
[1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:23.800]  You know my concern with the Waukesha would be whether it's some sort of Antifa retaliation.
[1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:27.320]  We don't know at this point but there were a lot of threats of it so hopefully that's
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:33.520]  not the case, hopefully that people were not badly injured so we just can hope and pray
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:35.480]  for the people in Waukesha.
[1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:41.800]  But it's the, and this is a function of the FBI was monitoring all of those riots throughout
[1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:46.560]  last summer and they allowed violence to escalate and did nothing about it.
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:50.760]  They had drone video footage of the protest all across the country that they've been
[1:34:50.760 --> 1:34:51.760]  hiding.
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:56.880]  In fact they had the drone footage of the incident involving Kyle Rittenhouse and they
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.320]  had been hiding it.
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:02.760]  The prosecutor knew about it, didn't disclose it until the last minute and then the HD version
[1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:09.920]  of what the FBI had magically got lost and this is the FBI HD version that we believe
[1:35:09.920 --> 1:35:13.880]  would have had exculpatory evidence favorable to Kyle Rittenhouse.
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:18.640]  Now I can say that despite Nadler's demand that the Department of Justice take action,
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:23.560]  the FBI already investigated the Rittenhouse case and recognized that there was absolutely
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:25.960]  no basis to go after Kyle.
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:29.520]  So the Eastern District of Wisconsin, I know a good number of the people there, they're
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:34.360]  actually one of the less political prosecutor's offices in the entire country.
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:39.000]  There is very little chance that Kyle faces any risk of any, there is no grounds for federal
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:40.480]  charges here period.
[1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:46.080]  Number one, number two, the FBI already investigated it and already cleared Kyle and three the Eastern
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:50.200]  District of Wisconsin is not as political as say the Southern District of New York that's
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:54.400]  going after Project Veritas or the District of Columbia that's going after Owen Shroyer
[1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:56.240]  and going after Steve Bannon.
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:01.120]  So I don't think there'll be any follow-up prosecution at all of Kyle, I think he is
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:02.120]  done with that.
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:06.600]  The jury verdict was heard loud and clear by the key people in positions of power and
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:10.440]  they know that there's no basis to go after Kyle any further.
[1:36:10.440 --> 1:36:13.960]  Let me ask you this question and again I don't want to bring up our own cases just we're
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:16.440]  in them but it all ties together.
[1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:20.400]  How, I don't know if you read it but you know because your mutual friend Norm Pattison,
[1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:25.400]  the criminal lawyer on the case up in DC, they say in the federal filing in response
[1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:30.320]  to us saying dismiss the multiple charges we'd spent several years in prison per charge,
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:35.800]  they say attack the capital, broke barricades, they repeat it and say Mr. Shroyer lies to
[1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:41.400]  the court in his filing, perjury, I mean it's insane and says he's with Alex Jones
[1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:46.680]  as a security, he's not with them and he did move barricades and then they show video
[1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:51.280]  that links that don't show what they say, it shows exculpatory evidence and I sat there
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:55.280]  and read the whole thing, went and watched all the videos and it made me physically
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:36:58.800]  ill that the federal prosecutors are this bad.
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:04.640]  Have they always been this bad or is it because how does Owen facing multiple counts, multiple
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:09.000]  years in prison when none of what they say is true in a filing, they're the ones engaged
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:13.480]  in perjury, open and shut and then how does he get defaulted in the Connecticut case when
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:17.120]  he stood separately and then they never even suspended him or asked for anything and the
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:20.880]  judge says you didn't give us the information, you don't get a jury trial because they can
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:26.720]  try to obfuscate with me and lie about that, I don't get this level at the state and at
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:30.640]  the local and federal level, like who are these people?
[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:34.680]  What you have is the complete political weaponization of the criminal justice process of which Kyle's
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:39.120]  case was the ultimate manifestation because here you have Kenosha, blue collar community,
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:43.440]  a community, a county that voted for Trump, longstanding democratic labor county but voted
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:49.800]  for Trump not once but twice, voted more for Trump in 2020 than 2016 and yet you had a prosecutor
[1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:54.320]  bring a case that even the judge recognized was absurd to bring, there was no basis to
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:57.800]  prosecute Kyle, they knew that all along, they brought charges that they knew there
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:02.920]  was no basis for, they brought a gun charge that never replied, it was always legal for
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:07.840]  a 17 year old to have a rifle in Wisconsin, always, I call it the old Wisconsin farm boy
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:12.920]  exception, they never required those people to have to register it, to ban them from owning
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:18.000]  it, none of that, it's only people younger, 15 or younger, that had to have beef for certain
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:23.040]  hunting permits, that's it, it never applied, handguns were limited to people 18 and older
[1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:25.360]  but in short barreled rifles, but not an act of legal...
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:29.120]  And anybody that hunts knows this, they have hunter safety courses which I think are good
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:32.800]  at the state level, where they have you go out this, if they're gonna give you the license
[1:38:32.800 --> 1:38:37.280]  you need to take the course, and that saves a lot of lives, it's good to have basic training,
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:41.800]  so please continue, exactly, that's what they were trying to say that he was hunting without
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:43.320]  his hunter safety course.
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:48.400]  Exactly, it had no application to him, at 17 years old you're always, when Wisconsin
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:53.200]  is a very rural small town state, very blue collar state, it's a state that always wanted
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:57.320]  to make sure the older boy on the farm could defend and protect the farm, and that's why
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:39:02.640]  rifles and shotguns were always legal for 16 year olds and 17 year olds to own and
[1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:03.640]  Wisconsin.
[1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:08.280]  They brought a false charge, pretending it was a short barreled rifle, knew it wasn't,
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:11.660]  misled the court, and then the court ultimately dismissed the charges, and you still have
[1:39:11.660 --> 1:39:17.400]  members of the media lying about that, it was always legal for Kyle to have that gun,
[1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:22.840]  and thank God he did, or not only would he be dead, other people would have been dead.
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:26.160]  Rosenbaum's the kind of guy who would have been an active shooter had he got that gun
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:30.120]  that night, and who knows how many people they were killed, because they were escalating
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:34.800]  the violence all night long, and it was going to keep going after Kyle, but for Kyle not
[1:39:34.800 --> 1:39:39.040]  only saving his own life, but saving the lives, and saving a lot of people's dreams
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:44.520]  and their property and their holdings in Kenosha, so it was always a false charge, but how could
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:45.520]  that even come about?
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:50.280]  How could a kid as clearly as innocent as Kyle Rittenhouse be criminally prosecuted
[1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:55.480]  in a county that Trump won, in a county that didn't support the prosecution?
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:39:59.400]  It's because so many people that have these positions of power within the prosecutorial
[1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:04.800]  branches, and sometimes the judicial branches are so politically biased and prejudiced,
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:09.160]  they're incapable of applying the uniform rule of law that's supposed to benefit all
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:10.160]  of us.
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:15.440]  And doesn't a fair judge like the Rittenhouse judge really make the corrupt judges stick
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:17.120]  out like sore thumbs?
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:21.840]  Absolutely, that's why the media attacked him so much, because he was actually an honest
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:26.120]  judge, he made a lot of pro-prosecution rulings in the case, but he wanted to be impartial
[1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:31.360]  as much as he possibly could, apply the rule of law evenly as best as he possibly could.
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:35.920]  I think he should have gone further and dismissed the case at key junctures, but he restrained
[1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:38.040]  it because he wanted to empower the jury.
[1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:42.960]  By contrast, look at the way the liberal judges and these other judges that are not applying
[1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:46.040]  the rule of law are scared of what a jury verdict would be.
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:49.320]  That's the only logic behind denying you a jury verdict.
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:53.440]  Denying you a jury in Texas, denying you a jury in Connecticut, they are terrified that
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:59.160]  even a liberal democratic jury pool will not see a side with them once they know what the
[1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:04.800]  real facts are, because ordinary people just have a way of standing up for the Constitution
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:08.560]  in the way these corrupt politicians in positions of power do not.
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:09.560]  And that's what we're seeing.
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:10.560]  And the DC circuit...
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:11.560]  Sure, go ahead, sorry.
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:12.560]  Particularly bad.
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:14.360]  No, no, DC, start over.
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:19.200]  Yeah, the DC prosecutors unit and the Southern District of New York are the two most politically
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:22.480]  corrupt prosecutors offices going on decades.
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:28.760]  There's a reason why Robert Mueller volunteered to work in the DC prosecutor's office when
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:33.280]  Clinton was there, because all of a sudden he ends up getting a prime gig to the US attorney's
[1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:38.320]  gig in San Francisco based on his special work there for the DC prosecutor's office.
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:42.080]  So when people can look at what other investigations he could have been involved in in the homicide
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:46.560]  division in DC that might have been pertinent to him as a Republican getting promoted to
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:49.760]  by Bill Clinton to what was considered one of the most prime prosecutorial gigs in the
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:50.760]  country.
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:56.200]  Yeah, he helped cover up the whitey-mulder stuff and he covers up Vince Foster.
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:41:57.200]  Exactly.
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:02.680]  And remember, Ron Brown took that little commerce trip to a war-torn region right at the time
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:03.680]  he was under grand jury.
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:08.400]  And the Air Force Flight Surgeon Colonel that did the autopsy said he had a 45-foot hole
[1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:09.400]  in his head.
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:10.400]  Exactly.
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:13.880]  And my recollection is they never did recover the black box that day.
[1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:20.040]  I mean, who sends somebody to a special trip for commerce purposes to a war-torn region?
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:23.920]  Oh, Billy Boy had his tricks up, but he needed somebody like Robert Mueller to protect him
[1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:25.200]  on the backside.
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:27.800]  And so the DC system has been corrupt for a long time.
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:30.200]  Southern District of New York has been corrupt for a long time.
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:34.200]  That's why we're seeing these crazy cases against Project Veritas and seeing these crazy cases
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:36.720]  against Owen Shroyer and Steve Bannon in DC.
[1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:41.120]  These are corrupt offices that need to be purged of their problematic prosecutors if
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:42.400]  we're going to move forward.
[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:43.400]  Absolutely.
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:44.680]  It's not fair to call them communists.
[1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:45.680]  That's the low level minions.
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:48.880]  These are like gangsters with badges and guns and lawyers.
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:53.720]  I mean, it's literally just thugs, absolutely, with nothing but pure criminal energy.
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:57.680]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:04.880]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:11.000]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides,
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:16.040]  horrible crashes and, again, so many toxins on them.
[1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:22.440]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at mfoldwarstore.com are clean, are pure,
[1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:28.120]  are highest quality and they're long lasting and they help focus your mind.

[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:07.880]  to increase testosterone and energy levels.

[1:44:13.280 --> 1:44:15.840]  about 1 to 2% per year.
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:23.040]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[1:44:57.440 --> 1:45:06.480]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:12.800]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:13.800]  in place.
[1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:18.000]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:23.480]  It is the symbol that we are diseased at evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:26.200]  faces from the light of the sun.
[1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:34.560]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:40.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now, the entire future destiny of humanity
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:41.920]  is upon us.
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:45.880]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:47.760]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:53.440]  Things only get worse from here if we submit, they only get better if we resist and say
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:54.440]  no.
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:57.600]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:03.680]  I'm sitting here, it's in the early morning hours, and I'm looking at mainstream news.
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:09.280]  Reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said
[1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:14.880]  that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:19.240]  because in studies they did on children it caused myocarditis that's heart swelling
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:21.080]  and heart attacks.
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:24.760]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting
[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:29.160]  any circulation, it's not on the national news, and it's very hard to even find on places
[1:46:29.160 --> 1:46:31.120]  like Instagram or Twitter, it's just crazy.
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:36.840]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines, it doesn't
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:41.560]  hurt anybody, you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it, it's just crazy.
[1:46:41.560 --> 1:46:44.800]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines
[1:46:44.800 --> 1:46:49.560]  are going to cause heart problems, they gave the exact reasons why and now it happened.
[1:46:49.560 --> 1:46:53.360]  That's why info wars is on air, because if we weren't on air they'd get away with even
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:54.360]  more of this crap.
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:47:00.560]  This is just insane, these people are killers.
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:07.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:07.560 --> 1:47:17.880]  The final segment of the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones show for the 6 p.m. Central
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:22.040]  here for the last 14 years, but I'm going to come back with Owen Schreuer in the next
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:27.480]  two hours of Sunday Live and we've cut it to six minutes of ads an hour, just six minutes
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:32.600]  for local radio stations, we've taken all of the network ads out and a lot of stations
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:33.600]  are picking it up.
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:38.760]  So Sunday Live with Owen Schreuer is coming up and we'll look at the latest out of Waukesha,
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:43.080]  if I'm saying that right, and most people get run over and reportedly shots fired and
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:46.800]  it's just terrible and we'll continue to watch that but we usually know who attached Christmas
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:52.480]  parades that we will see if it's connected to Antifa or if it's Islamic or if it's a
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:56.800]  gang or God knows what, but they're saying the dancing grannies were some of the ones
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:47:58.640]  that got shot.
[1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:02.440]  This is just pure evil, absolutely out of control and it's the perfect example though
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:07.120]  of the gun isn't what did it and the car isn't what did it, it's a bad person wielding it
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:11.640]  because I could kill you with this marble table I got right here real easy or that dagger
[1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:16.720]  over there but it's not the dagger, it's not the animal object.
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:20.440]  Robert Barnes, we always plug this at the end but I really like watching the show that
[1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:27.160]  you co-host with that great French lawyer and I also see a French Canadian lawyer and
[1:48:27.160 --> 1:48:30.760]  I also see a lot of other great shows doing great work, how do people find everything
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:32.320]  Robert Barnes related?
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:40.160]  Sure, at VivaBarnsLaw.locals.com so that's where people want exemplars and examples
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:47.400]  of letters to object to various vaccine mandates and other mandates including religious exemplars,
[1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:51.160]  including medical exemplars, all of that is available there, we're also putting up all
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:55.680]  of the lawsuit data and other information there so it's publicly available, publicly
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:00.160]  accessible at VivaBarnsLaw.locals.com.
[1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:04.680]  That leads me now on the nine minutes we've got left in this hour to you're right at the
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:08.560]  tip of the spear with Robert Kennedy Jr. and so many suits around the country, you're also
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:12.680]  tracking others, you're the guy that's got the suit getting filed with the whistleblower
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:17.720]  body's been hearing about with Pfizer in a very, very soon, I don't know if you can say
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:22.600]  when, I know you've told me off air, but what do you make of what's happening?
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:29.600]  I mean, oh 55 years to the year 2077, don't release any of the findings of our studies
[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:33.920]  and oh arrest anybody that questions us and the British Medical Journal saying you're
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:39.440]  twice as likely to die if you've had the vaccine, I mean that's bombshell stuff and their answer
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:44.400]  is they want to arrest us and then it's the literal people that ran the Wuhan lab doing
[1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:48.440]  that, I mean these are like super villains naked, it's like cover commander with his
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:53.680]  mask off, I mean this makes me think things might be a simulation Barnes, I mean I think
[1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:57.280]  we're all real but maybe it's you know, I mean because this is getting like too much
[1:49:57.280 --> 1:50:01.280]  here, like what will we handle, what will we not put up with, this is getting insane,
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:04.640]  so what moment in history do you think we are at right now and how the hell do they
[1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:08.280]  think they're going to get away with this because barring a nuclear war or something,
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:13.400]  I don't see how they don't all go to prison because everybody's waking up brother.
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:17.040]  Oh agreed and we're going to continue to fight back in the court of law along with the folks
[1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:21.080]  that fight back in the court of public opinion and I think that is where places like InfoWars
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:25.320]  have been critical that but for InfoWars who knows what would have happened, what could
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:29.440]  have happened, people are waking up because the InfoWars audience has continued to support
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:34.280]  InfoWars despite all of the attacks because people can get products that they like and
[1:50:34.280 --> 1:50:38.840]  support independent free speech, independent free press in the way our founders intended
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:43.440]  at the same time, get healthier, wealthier and wiser simultaneously.
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:48.040]  It's because of the InfoWars model that there has been the capacity and the ability for
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:51.960]  this information to get out there, to get outside of their control, I mean you look
[1:50:51.960 --> 1:50:56.440]  at the written house case but for the importance of arguing in the court of public opinion
[1:50:56.440 --> 1:51:00.840]  he might have been railroaded but for you look at what's happened in vaccine mandates but
[1:51:00.840 --> 1:51:04.800]  for the independent information leading to informed resistance, who knows what would
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:08.440]  have happened because historically nobody fought back, you know when Connie Buck when
[1:51:08.440 --> 1:51:11.960]  they were doing forced sterilizations, nobody was there to fight for her.
[1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:15.600]  Now there's people to fight for all the Connie Buck's around the country, for all the Kyle
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:20.040]  written houses across the country, thanks in large part to audiences like InfoWars keeping
[1:51:20.040 --> 1:51:24.760]  InfoWars alive by supporting InfoWars by buying products that make them healthier and wealthier
[1:51:24.760 --> 1:51:26.600]  at the same time anyway.
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:30.800]  So thanks to the InfoWars audience for doing that, they've been the critical critical audience
[1:51:30.800 --> 1:51:32.480]  absolutely.
[1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:36.240]  Our freedoms alive across the board and what we're going to be doing next in the court
[1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:39.360]  of law is I'm going to be bringing two suits down in Texas.
[1:51:39.360 --> 1:51:43.840]  The first is with Bobby Kennedy we're going to be suing the FDA for their unlawful abuse
[1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:48.720]  of emergency power in their emergency use authorization of this vaccine for five year
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:49.800]  old children.
[1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:53.560]  What they're doing is they're taking that emergency use authorization statute and they're
[1:51:53.560 --> 1:51:58.640]  carving out an emergency loophole like as we both know from the Weimar Constitution
[1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:03.080]  days the Weimar Constitution was considered the greatest constitution in the history of
[1:52:03.080 --> 1:52:04.080]  Europe.
[1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:05.080]  So how did the Nazis seize power?
[1:52:05.080 --> 1:52:07.800]  They had an emergency exception written into it.
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:12.640]  Our founders were smart enough to say no emergency exception but what is the FDA using?
[1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:17.120]  They're using the emergency statute to get around all of the rules that apply.
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:21.800]  So they're saying the APA doesn't govern them, that people the citizen's petition process
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:25.840]  doesn't govern them, that the notice and comment rules don't govern them and they're saying
[1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:31.640]  nobody can sue them and as long as they call it emergency use they are beyond review, beyond
[1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:36.480]  review by the legislative branch, beyond review by the judicial branch, beyond review by ordinary
[1:52:36.480 --> 1:52:37.480]  people.
[1:52:37.480 --> 1:52:41.280]  We're going to file suit and say that is a misuse and abuse of the emergency powers
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:43.320]  that the Constitution does not permit.
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:48.020]  They're doing illegal marketing and illegal advertising conspiring with CNN and Sanjay
[1:52:48.020 --> 1:52:53.240]  Gupta to use Big Bird and Sesame Street to lie to children about the safety and efficacy
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:57.560]  of these vaccines, particularly for young children that are not meaningfully at risk
[1:52:57.560 --> 1:52:58.560]  from this virus.
[1:52:58.560 --> 1:52:59.960]  Robert, this is huge breaking news.
[1:52:59.960 --> 1:53:03.640]  I mean, a start over, I should have had you on for a whole hour about this.
[1:53:03.640 --> 1:53:06.400]  You're getting ready to sue CNN?
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:10.480]  So yeah, we're also looking at suing CNN and Sanjay Gupta and bringing medical ethics complaints
[1:53:10.480 --> 1:53:14.560]  against him because what he did was illegal marketing to children.
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:17.120]  You cannot market this vaccine to children.
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:19.640]  You can't support marketing this vaccine to children.
[1:53:19.640 --> 1:53:23.680]  The emergency use authorization doesn't allow that, the law doesn't allow that.
[1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:27.400]  And what he was doing was not only unprofessional and unethical, it was illegal.
[1:53:27.400 --> 1:53:29.120]  And what CNN was doing was illegal.
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:33.960]  And what the FDA and CDC and conspiring with it is also illegal and unlawful.
[1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:37.800]  So we're going to be bringing suit against the children, for children's health defense
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:42.720]  against the FDA and the CDC, looking at bringing suit against Sanjay Gupta and CNN on behalf
[1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:44.240]  of the Unity Project.
[1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:48.200]  And on top of that, I'm looking at another suit, the whistleblower who blew the whistle
[1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:53.680]  on all the fraudulent activities going on in the clinical trials by Pfizer and subcontractors.
[1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:58.240]  Their subcontractor, Ventavia, Texas-based company, went out and lied about her.
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:01.480]  Went out and said that my whistleblower had never worked for them.
[1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:02.480]  It was a total lie.
[1:54:02.480 --> 1:54:03.480]  We got the contracts.
[1:54:03.480 --> 1:54:04.480]  We got the emails.
[1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:05.480]  We got the documents.
[1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:09.600]  So we're going to be suing them for libel and suing them in Texas for what they did,
[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:14.000]  including suing the publicist individually who was part of those lies and was part of
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  those libel.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:18.800]  There's been lots of lies by the press, lots of lies by government actors, lots of lies
[1:54:18.800 --> 1:54:23.320]  by powerful drug companies, and it's time all of them be held accountable.
[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:26.400]  And that's what we're going to be doing next week in Texas.
[1:54:26.400 --> 1:54:27.400]  Very exciting.
[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:31.760]  And I picked up the name of the organization, obviously, that Robert Kenny Jr. runs.
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:33.040]  We're well familiar with that.
[1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:36.760]  The other group I know about, but just tell us a little bit about the name of it and about
[1:54:36.760 --> 1:54:38.800]  the organization.
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:43.600]  So yeah, representing children's health defense with Bobby Kennedy to go after the FDA and
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:48.240]  the CDC, representing my whistleblower, Brooke Jackson against Ventavia, which is a local
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:54.200]  company in Texas that was subcontracted by Pfizer to do the clinical testing that was
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:55.360]  just atrocious.
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:54:56.480]  It was a complete joke.
[1:54:56.480 --> 1:54:58.400]  There wasn't anything scientific about it.
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:03.160]  The British Medical Journal, one of the most well-respected peer-reviewed medical publications
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:08.600]  in the world, independently verified it, independently researched it, independently investigated
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:13.760]  and came to the exact same conclusion that there was deeply problematic fraudulent activities
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:17.280]  by Pfizer in getting this vaccine approved in the first place.
[1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:22.920]  She is filing a declaration in support of the children's health defense suit, and I'll
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:27.240]  be bringing suit for her against Pfizer and its affiliates and associates who have been
[1:55:27.240 --> 1:55:32.200]  lying and libeling her all across the entire world because they needed to cover up their
[1:55:32.200 --> 1:55:33.200]  corruption.
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:36.920]  And then the other group that's looking to go after CNN, tell us the name of that.
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:41.680]  Oh, the Unity Project is a new project, so the Unity Project is based out of California.
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:46.360]  It's bringing together Dr. Robert Malone, some of the top doctors, some top Army personnel,
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:52.160]  some top legal counsel, top political people to fight vaccine mandates for children and
[1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:53.680]  to fight vaccine mandates in general.
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:55.040]  It's a great project.
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:56.040]  People can find it online.
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:56:00.040]  The Unity Project, they're going to be putting up projects that you can take to your local
[1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:05.120]  school board, that you can take to your doctor, that you can take to your employer, that you
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:09.640]  can use to show them the problems with any of these vaccine mandates, to show them the
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:14.120]  risks and dangers of what this vaccine can do for people health-wise, to show them how
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:19.360]  there is not such risk from the virus itself to these populations, healthy young populations.
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:24.400]  So the goal is to bring people together across the political spectrum, across the legal spectrum,
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:27.960]  with some of the top doctors in the world, some of the top personnel in the world to
[1:56:27.960 --> 1:56:28.960]  fight back.
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:33.200]  And it's being funded by some people who are willing to be independent and fight back.
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:34.880]  So it's another great effort.
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:36.480]  I'm working with them as well.
[1:56:36.480 --> 1:56:39.960]  We're going to fight back everywhere we can in the court of public opinion and the court
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:45.560]  of law and give the people the tools so that they can fight back on their own terms because
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:46.560]  of what is happening.
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:47.560]  Wow.
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:48.560]  Very excited.
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:52.920]  So you're going to be here after Thanksgiving, getting the suits filed, I know, in Central
[1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:55.400]  Texas and then there'll be other suits filed.
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:56:56.400]  Very exciting.
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:56:58.120]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much for the time.
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:56:59.120]  Amazing interview.
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:00.120]  Yep.
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:01.120]  Glad to be here, Alex.
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:03.960]  Hey, guys, put him on hold right now and see when he can come home for an hour during
[1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:06.680]  the week while we got Barnes right now in place.
[1:57:06.680 --> 1:57:07.680]  Thanks.
[1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:08.680]  Wow.
[1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:09.680]  Okay.
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:10.680]  I'm going to come back and host some with Owen for at least 30 minutes.
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:11.680]  And he's going to take over the rest of the time.
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:14.640]  But I got a bunch of stuff we didn't get to and me and Owen are on the same page here.
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:18.440]  We've got a lot to cover that is coming up with Sunday Live.
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:23.000]  If your station doesn't carry Sunday Live, Sunday, 6 to 8 p.m. Central, it really should.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:29.200]  You can all find it at freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv, Bandod video, and the Alex Jones live show
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:30.200]  feed.
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:37.480]  A Sunday Live right there, you can find that at thenetworkfeedatinfowars.com, and whatever
[1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:39.200]  you do, share those links.
[1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:42.000]  That's how we destroy the globalist with the info war.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:43.320]  You are the soldiers.
[1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:47.680]  Share the links.
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:54.840]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy bills.
[1:57:54.840 --> 1:58:00.040]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:06.000]  They're horrible crashes and, again, so many toxins in them.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:12.400]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at infowarstore.com are clean, are pure, are
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:18.080]  highest quality, and they're long lasting and they help focus your mind.
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:23.640]  And right now our strongest product, the three new tropics we have, Rainforce Plus, Rainforce
[1:58:23.640 --> 1:58:30.640]  Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:34.200]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[1:58:34.200 --> 1:58:37.040]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[1:58:37.040 --> 1:58:44.720]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available
[1:58:44.720 --> 1:58:48.640]  right now and it funds the info war 360 win.
[1:58:48.640 --> 1:58:54.080]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[1:58:54.080 --> 1:58:58.080]  happening in the atmosphere, but if you look at all the different studies and reports about
[1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:02.880]  my NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening
[1:59:02.880 --> 1:59:03.880]  with the climate.
[1:59:03.880 --> 1:59:08.880]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:14.280]  So yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing
[1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:17.600]  back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming, and when that didn't
[1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:20.680]  really happen the way they wanted to, okay, now it's just climate change.
[1:59:20.680 --> 1:59:26.680]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[1:59:26.680 --> 1:59:30.600]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:31.600]  They have.
[1:59:31.600 --> 1:59:36.440]  Weather control treaties from 1979, Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very
[1:59:36.440 --> 1:59:37.440]  long time.
[1:59:37.440 --> 1:59:41.640]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[1:59:41.640 --> 1:59:44.360]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:55.600]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
