[00:00.000 --> 00:18.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:18.120 --> 00:24.680]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot-com studios it's Alex
[00:24.680 --> 00:32.760]  Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Sunday October the 4th 2015 I'm
[00:32.760 --> 00:37.600]  David Knight your host I'm back from covering the martial law events that we
[00:37.600 --> 00:41.840]  had in the Northeast I was gone last week I had to take a little bit of time
[00:41.840 --> 00:48.920]  and decompress after that depressing situation we covered what the the
[00:48.920 --> 00:52.640]  politics of what the Pope was selling we covered the martial law there and I
[00:52.640 --> 00:56.800]  have to say it just kept getting worse it wasn't the amount of time that we were
[00:56.800 --> 01:01.120]  there but it was what we saw in Philadelphia my wife had told me that
[01:01.120 --> 01:04.280]  it was going to be much worse in Philadelphia and I said oh they all
[01:04.280 --> 01:08.920]  like to brag about what a giant martial law presidents are going to create but
[01:08.920 --> 01:14.760]  they shut down that entire city and the saddest thing is the people loved it
[01:14.760 --> 01:21.280]  they were just reveling in how safe they were you have to understand that the
[01:21.280 --> 01:28.040]  TSA was not there to keep the TSA was there to keep them away from the Pope
[01:28.040 --> 01:32.840]  away from one man there to protect one man there to protect a government
[01:32.840 --> 01:37.800]  official if you will from another country and of course it's amazing to see in
[01:37.800 --> 01:41.560]  Washington and in New York where they have the president and the Congress all
[01:41.560 --> 01:44.840]  the time where the UN where they had leaders of all these different countries
[01:44.840 --> 01:50.160]  how they stepped up the protection in the wake of the Pope being there so we're
[01:50.160 --> 01:53.800]  going to talk about some of what we saw some of the politics that was that was
[01:53.800 --> 01:58.240]  there and we had an amazing interview with some people who were part of a
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.240]  network of those who'd been abused by priests and I want you to hear what they
[02:02.240 --> 02:05.280]  have to say but of course the big stories that we're going to be talking
[02:05.280 --> 02:08.600]  about are the shootings that happened at the end of the week and the reactions
[02:08.600 --> 02:15.920]  to those we have CNN turning this into a white shooter even though he's mixed
[02:15.920 --> 02:20.480]  race we have a story that's up on the drudge report an info war story
[02:20.480 --> 02:25.440]  CNN turns mixed race Oregon shooter into a white man and the LA Times is
[02:25.440 --> 02:29.360]  claiming that he was a white supremacist we're going to talk about the
[02:29.360 --> 02:33.400]  motivations and the way they're turning this again yet another story that they're
[02:33.400 --> 02:39.240]  using for divide and conquer and of course the the media is spinning this
[02:39.240 --> 02:44.800]  back and saying we have a war that's one of the comments of the man who was the
[02:44.800 --> 02:49.720]  father of the newspaper reporter in Virginia as part of that shooting he
[02:49.720 --> 02:53.200]  says there's a war going on yes there's a war at multiple levels there is a
[02:53.200 --> 02:57.480]  political war there's a racial war there is a divide and conquer that is being
[02:57.480 --> 03:00.640]  pushed by the president by the media and that's not being talked about we're
[03:00.640 --> 03:04.480]  gonna have the reactions though of various candidates one of the reactions
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.120]  of candidates Joe Biden and let's let's be honest Joe Biden is running for
[03:09.120 --> 03:13.080]  president that's been admitted he hasn't made the official announcement he's
[03:13.080 --> 03:17.880]  still I would say Joe Biden his time but he started making comparisons when he
[03:17.880 --> 03:20.320]  talked about the Second Amendment he says you don't have a right to have
[03:20.320 --> 03:25.880]  fighter jets well we're gonna talk about what the man who has control of the
[03:25.880 --> 03:30.960]  fighter jets has been doing just as we had this shooter in Oregon attack nine
[03:30.960 --> 03:36.880]  people because they were Christians Obama attacked a hospital because they
[03:36.880 --> 03:40.960]  had some Taliban patients there he continued the attack for over a half
[03:40.960 --> 03:45.440]  hour after the doctors without borders had alerted them of course they they
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.040]  knew where that hospital was they knew that they were treating people of all
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.080]  different types you don't attack hospitals you don't attack red cross
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.240]  vehicles you don't shoot medics those are called war crimes there's
[03:59.240 --> 04:05.200]  international laws against that so we've got a president who killed 19 at a
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.160]  hospital that he attacked we're going to talk about that don't lecture us on
[04:11.160 --> 04:16.840]  Second Amendment issues when you are using fighter jets to attack hospitals
[04:16.840 --> 04:22.440]  you are a war criminal for doing that I'm not the only one saying that the UN
[04:22.440 --> 04:27.160]  is saying that the doctors without borders are saying that they knew that
[04:27.160 --> 04:32.360]  hospital was a they had notified them back at the end of September and they
[04:32.360 --> 04:37.640]  contacted them and the attack continued for 30 minutes we're also going to talk
[04:37.640 --> 04:42.000]  about what this back and forth in Syria is showing us about the real
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.480]  intentions of the United States in Syria and the use of these Islamic jihadi
[04:47.480 --> 04:52.040]  terrorists as surrogates for American foreign policy stay with us we're going
[04:52.040 --> 04:55.760]  to have a report from Alex Jones when we come back he's going to talk about the

[06:55.240 --> 06:59.400]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here with breaking news and information
[06:59.400 --> 07:06.320]  reporting for info wars dot com now as you know a few days ago in Oregon there
[07:06.320 --> 07:12.160]  was another tragic shooting 10 people dead the man who shot and killed at least
[07:12.160 --> 07:16.240]  10 people on Thursday openly asked people if they were Christians just like
[07:16.240 --> 07:20.200]  Columbine and if they said yes and wouldn't recant their faith killed them
[07:20.200 --> 07:25.320]  but there is almost no corporate mainstream media reporting on that fact
[07:25.320 --> 07:30.040]  it's buried in local newspapers imagine if someone went in and asked if they
[07:30.040 --> 07:33.960]  were quote gay and then shot them if they were you would have guilt being
[07:33.960 --> 07:39.200]  projected onto all libertarians all conservatives all Christians as if we
[07:39.200 --> 07:45.280]  had committed the crime but instead it's being covered up just like the racist
[07:45.280 --> 07:49.440]  crazy black guy shooting the white reporters and then that got swept out of
[07:49.440 --> 07:54.200]  the rug this is all part of the larger social engineering but in a chilling
[07:54.200 --> 08:00.720]  development president Obama in multiple speeches has said we need to look at
[08:00.720 --> 08:07.200]  solutions not just more legislation but solutions like Australia and the UK head
[08:07.200 --> 08:13.560]  well those solutions in the 90s were total gun confiscation in fact the real
[08:13.560 --> 08:18.120]  crocodile Dundee this is in the NRA magazine over a decade ago the real
[08:18.120 --> 08:21.640]  crocodile Dundee that the movie was based on famous trapper famous
[08:21.640 --> 08:26.680]  outdoorsman refused to turn in his guns and the police came and killed him in
[08:26.680 --> 08:32.840]  his home he shot three of them but this is where gun confiscation goes is into
[08:32.840 --> 08:38.720]  firefights and this is the type of civil war they want to start they project
[08:38.720 --> 08:44.560]  this guilt on the gun owners for mass shootings that killed 167 people a year
[08:44.560 --> 08:51.960]  on average 167 people out of 330 million people it's one of the rarest forms of
[08:51.960 --> 08:57.040]  death a mass shooting 11,000 die a year and change sometimes 12,000 from guns
[08:57.040 --> 09:02.320]  most of them are suicides then the next statistic look it up is cops shooting
[09:02.320 --> 09:06.240]  criminals than its citizen shooting criminals way down there at the bottom
[09:06.240 --> 09:10.560]  is criminal shooting citizens that's the truth we're an armed society and here it
[09:10.560 --> 09:16.200]  is from Breitbart Obama goes beyond your gun control hints of confiscation and
[09:16.200 --> 09:20.360]  then it's got his quotes here saying we need to do basically what our friends
[09:20.360 --> 09:23.840]  and allies have done great Britain Australia and others like it and so he
[09:23.840 --> 09:29.080]  goes into talking about going beyond legislation shifting gears talking about
[09:29.080 --> 09:33.720]  weapons in the hands of quote good guys I'm not saying the Russians are perfect
[09:33.720 --> 09:38.120]  but compared to ISIS or Al Qaeda they are the good guys they're being attacked
[09:38.120 --> 09:43.200]  they're only warm water port in the Mediterranean is being attacked Syria is
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.560]  being attacked they're being attacked by IS type terrorist in Tajikistan and in
[09:48.560 --> 09:54.680]  other areas south of Russia places like Chechnya so the Russians have gone in
[09:54.680 --> 09:58.680]  and are actually targeting Al Nuzra which is Al Qaeda which is the command
[09:58.680 --> 10:03.400]  group of ISIS and they're also targeting ISIS and they're releasing the drone
[10:03.400 --> 10:08.160]  footage of those successful attacks taking place our government on record
[10:08.160 --> 10:12.560]  funded all the radical Islamists to go into that area there are no moderate
[10:12.560 --> 10:16.840]  rebels they're trying to turn Syria over to Saudi Arabia that already conquered
[10:16.840 --> 10:20.480]  Syria in the last century so they've taken Syria before let's go to this
[10:20.480 --> 10:25.600]  article Russian Air Force destroys terrorist command center says the
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.120]  defense ministry and releases the video and says that they have hit at least 20
[10:30.120 --> 10:36.560]  times 20 sorties against Islamic State you can see the photos the video all of
[10:36.560 --> 10:42.480]  it should be American pilots there bombing Al Qaeda and of course I made a
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.040]  big deal about this on Friday because it was a huge deal I showed everybody
[10:46.040 --> 10:53.080]  Reuters reporting on it where it openly admitted Reuters that Al Nuzra is the
[10:53.080 --> 10:57.600]  name of Al Qaeda in Syria and that the Russians first target they hit on
[10:57.600 --> 11:03.760]  Wednesday of last week with more than 30 attacks was Al Nuzra command bases
[11:03.760 --> 11:08.920]  and they actually said which is an Al Qaeda group and so our government
[11:08.920 --> 11:14.560]  criticized Russia for striking Al Qaeda this is how upside down all of this has
[11:14.560 --> 11:20.160]  gotten 14 years after 9-11 but the truth is we went after Iraq for 9-11 when
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.520]  Saudi Arabia has been proven to have been involved with our government so they
[11:24.520 --> 11:29.600]  use the attacks of 9-11 to go after Iraq to destabilize the whole Middle East and
[11:29.600 --> 11:35.160]  then the very people involved in it are now have proxy wars taking over let's
[11:35.160 --> 11:39.280]  shift gears now out of that situation is something I warned the pregnant women
[11:39.280 --> 11:42.520]  about all the time because I know families this has happened to an Austin I
[11:42.520 --> 11:46.000]  know families across the country that have told me about it and sent me their
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.760]  horror stories about a third of the marijuana tests they give pregnant
[11:49.760 --> 11:53.440]  women turn out to be false positives but so what a woman has been smoking
[11:53.440 --> 11:57.840]  marijuana is it better to take their kids away from them and now it's back in
[11:57.840 --> 12:02.440]  the news up on info wars.com new mothers tested for drugs without their
[12:02.440 --> 12:06.480]  consent by some Alabama hospitals a woman who tested positive for drugs in
[12:06.480 --> 12:11.040]  hospital can be arrested and they take your children away that's from all gov
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.440]  and you go read that story at info wars.com and the reason I'm just
[12:15.440 --> 12:20.280]  bringing that in here is showing how there's a whole predator system while
[12:20.280 --> 12:23.080]  the government ships in the majority of the drugs the big banks wanted the drug
[12:23.080 --> 12:26.760]  money that women aren't being told when you go in to have a baby at a hospital
[12:26.760 --> 12:32.320]  they're going to test you for more than 15 drugs from prescription to illegal
[12:32.320 --> 12:35.960]  and then they're going to ask you do you have a prescription for this or why are
[12:35.960 --> 12:38.840]  you smoking marijuana they're not reading you your rights they're not
[12:38.840 --> 12:41.600]  telling you that they're working with the police that they have a health
[12:41.600 --> 12:45.000]  department computer terminal that they're entering all that data in they're
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.400]  not telling you when they send your husband into the next room to fill out
[12:47.400 --> 12:51.280]  paperwork that when they ask you you got enough money honey he treats you nice
[12:51.280 --> 12:55.280]  honey that they're about to put that in a health department report to send CPS to
[12:55.280 --> 13:00.280]  take your kids just like they announced you have social security recipients
[13:00.280 --> 13:04.280]  direct transfer of their money they're now going to be declared incompetent and
[13:04.280 --> 13:07.560]  have their guns taken even though they pressure you to do automatic wire
[13:07.560 --> 13:11.200]  transfer this is the type of stuff that's just going on in this police state
[13:11.200 --> 13:15.960]  and then finally mothers don't have a right with their children to say no to
[13:15.960 --> 13:21.240]  vaccines according to government but trans able this is a serious story at
[13:21.240 --> 13:26.360]  info wars.com with serious national television promoting it about how
[13:26.360 --> 13:31.400]  wonderful it was this woman wanted to be blind and so she poured Drano in her
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.440]  eyes and the psychologist helped pour it in her eyes and it's so beautiful and
[13:35.440 --> 13:40.440]  shouldn't taxpayers pay for people that are going to be on full disability
[13:40.440 --> 13:45.560]  because they had perfect sight and wanted to be blind and now if you have
[13:45.560 --> 13:50.600]  sight does that hurt someone else's feelings because they say if you're
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.480]  transgendered then someone being a father or a mother or a boy or a girl or he
[13:55.480 --> 13:58.920]  or she might hurt you because you're not a he or she you're a whatever you
[13:58.920 --> 14:03.160]  think you are that day maybe a box maybe a dog maybe a Eiffel Tower maybe an
[14:03.160 --> 14:07.680]  Easter Bunny maybe a Keeble or Elf maybe a wombat I don't know it's just
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.440]  whatever you want everyone has to then follow your lead and do whatever you say
[14:11.440 --> 14:16.840]  and oh my gosh you're the boss it's social control but now what if other
[14:16.840 --> 14:21.360]  people have sight and you don't should we gouge everyone's eyes out to make us
[14:21.360 --> 14:27.160]  equal it's now reaching that insane point when jewel shumping had a
[14:27.160 --> 14:31.080]  psychologist pour drain cleaner in her eyes to blind her the reason she gave
[14:31.080 --> 14:34.840]  was precisely the same justification of my transgender people who have a
[14:34.840 --> 14:39.160]  genital surgery removed and of course now that they move is make this tax payer
[14:39.160 --> 14:43.760]  funded you can go see the interview with her we could play more of it coming up
[14:43.760 --> 14:48.800]  here in the official reports with a straight face with straight news like
[14:48.800 --> 14:55.000]  this is a good thing and your clothes minded if you don't accept it you're
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.240]  not cool I went blind on purpose but I don't feel it was a choice there you go
[15:02.240 --> 15:06.560]  and then it's just how sexy how cool so we're giving all these faux rights
[15:06.560 --> 15:11.240]  all our basic rights are being taken away all right that's it for this update

[19:59.040 --> 20:14.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:14.840 --> 20:28.280]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show on
[20:28.280 --> 20:33.680]  this Sunday October the 4th 2015 I'm David Knight and as you just heard
[20:33.680 --> 20:38.040]  from Alex Jones as he was reporting what has happened in the last couple of
[20:38.040 --> 20:43.520]  days we've had now a major push from Obama trying to use the latest shooting
[20:43.520 --> 20:48.240]  to push for outright gun confiscation and of course they're also using it to
[20:48.240 --> 20:53.840]  push for a race war here within this country I want to talk about that and I
[20:53.840 --> 20:59.280]  want to talk about the real war that is heating up in Syria we're approaching
[20:59.280 --> 21:03.800]  something that is looking very much like the beginnings of a possible world war
[21:03.800 --> 21:06.440]  what we've been concerned about for quite some time we're seeing that not only
[21:06.440 --> 21:11.480]  in Syria but also in the Ukraine we're going to analyze what's going on there
[21:11.480 --> 21:16.120]  and what's behind it as I was out last week I was listening to Alex Jones's
[21:16.120 --> 21:20.840]  interview with Annie Jacobson and the book that she wrote about the history of
[21:20.840 --> 21:24.880]  DARPA I listened to that interview got me interested in the book and on my drive
[21:24.880 --> 21:30.600]  home I listened to the beginning of that book it is an amazing book you
[21:30.600 --> 21:34.840]  really need to get that educate yourself to educate others about the history of
[21:34.840 --> 21:40.200]  the dark side of our government you need to understand the character of our
[21:40.200 --> 21:43.400]  government and I like the way that she takes it all the way back to the Cold
[21:43.400 --> 21:47.440]  War when she starts talking about the history of DARPA it's not a cold
[21:47.440 --> 21:52.200]  documentary type of book she has a lot of detail she paints a very very vivid
[21:52.200 --> 21:59.040]  picture beginning with the first test of a hydrogen bomb the fusion bomb they
[21:59.040 --> 22:03.400]  were concerned they were going to set the atmosphere on fire because it fuses
[22:03.400 --> 22:09.000]  hydrogen atoms they thought it might get uncontrolled and actually for a while
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.520]  they thought it might it it was two and a half times larger than they had
[22:12.520 --> 22:17.040]  expected so it scared them quite a bit when they showed Eisenhower the
[22:17.040 --> 22:22.640]  radiation pattern the intense radiation they overlaid that radiation pattern
[22:22.640 --> 22:28.160]  over the northeastern United States cities where I just was following the
[22:28.160 --> 22:33.160]  Pope Washington New York Philadelphia showing that most of the people in those
[22:33.160 --> 22:38.280]  areas and that northeastern corridor would die from one hydrogen bomb just
[22:38.280 --> 22:42.040]  from the radiation just within a couple of hours many more people would die
[22:42.040 --> 22:46.160]  shortly after that there was a lot of concern in the country at that time
[22:46.160 --> 22:50.760]  about what they could do for civil defense so they had a hearing and they
[22:50.760 --> 22:55.760]  had a senator Keith offer who you might have heard of and many other contexts but
[22:55.760 --> 22:59.400]  he had a hearing on what are you going to do about civil defense the man who
[22:59.400 --> 23:03.720]  got up and testified under oath said well we're going to build a few bunkers
[23:03.720 --> 23:06.320]  in the cities but for the most part we want people to try to get out of the
[23:06.320 --> 23:09.640]  city and he said what are they going to do when they get out of the city we
[23:09.640 --> 23:13.200]  recommend that they drive as far as they can and then when they see the flash
[23:13.200 --> 23:17.080]  they get out of their car and line a ditch on the side of the road and maybe
[23:17.080 --> 23:21.600]  cover themselves with something and they could not believe what they were
[23:21.600 --> 23:25.240]  hearing he then modified it said well we've talked about possibly putting them
[23:25.240 --> 23:34.520]  in some long concrete tubes that we then might cover up with some some dirt it
[23:34.520 --> 23:40.520]  was absolutely ridiculous and of course we've had many instances of people
[23:40.520 --> 23:44.920]  looking at duck and cover the nonsense that was put out the propaganda films
[23:44.920 --> 23:48.680]  that our government put out in the 1960s to try to make people feel better there
[23:48.680 --> 23:53.400]  was a cartoon that came out I think in the 80s from the UK making fun of the
[23:53.400 --> 23:58.040]  civil defense preparations in Britain it was an older couple there was a nuclear
[23:58.040 --> 24:02.960]  war they followed to the letter what they were told to do and the flyers from
[24:02.960 --> 24:08.680]  their government and you watch them die slowly from radiation poisoning that is
[24:08.680 --> 24:12.000]  what our government is concerned about and of course at the same time they were
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.600]  telling Eisenhower to sell this any Jacobson talks about her book the
[24:17.600 --> 24:20.840]  Pentagon's brain she talks about how he was conflicted with us because he had
[24:20.840 --> 24:26.160]  seen the radiation patterns he knew that all of this was total nonsense there
[24:26.160 --> 24:31.040]  wasn't anything they were going to be able to do the people who were who
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.440]  triggered the explosion on Bikini Island nearly died from radiation
[24:35.440 --> 24:42.000]  themselves they were in a hardened facility it had 10 feet of soil over
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.240]  three-foot thick concrete walls and the radiation was so high inside of that
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.520]  they were miles away from ground zero radiation was so high even in that
[24:50.520 --> 24:56.360]  preparation bunker that they nearly died so Eisenhower knew all this and he was
[24:56.360 --> 25:02.760]  asked to sell this civil defense to the people at the same time they had German
[25:02.760 --> 25:08.120]  scientists who came over from operation paperclip building bunkers inside of
[25:08.120 --> 25:13.720]  mountains for them that were essentially a thousand foot thick concrete walls so
[25:13.720 --> 25:18.960]  that Eisenhower and the pro or whoever was president could survive in a kind of
[25:18.960 --> 25:24.600]  doctor strange love scenario this is your compassionate government this is
[25:24.600 --> 25:28.120]  the government that wants you to give up everything all of your liberties they
[25:28.120 --> 25:31.760]  want you to give up your guns because they're going to keep you safe because
[25:31.760 --> 25:35.720]  they care about you now now they don't let me give you a couple of other
[25:35.720 --> 25:40.200]  examples this just came out the last couple of days secret service targeting
[25:40.200 --> 25:46.040]  of Representative Jason Chavez could give pause to other lawmakers the secret
[25:46.040 --> 25:50.400]  service went after him because he investigated their incompetence so they
[25:50.400 --> 25:55.040]  exposed him even Simpson Brenner the lead author of the Patriot Act has
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.880]  protested lax oversight of the National Security Agency's activities and this
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.920]  leak so the lawmakers are very concerned about this because they realize that even
[26:05.920 --> 26:10.880]  if they question the Praetorian Guard that guards the president for
[26:10.880 --> 26:16.960]  incompetence they themselves could become targets of blackmail that's where
[26:16.960 --> 26:22.240]  this secret dark government that answers no questions that's why it's very
[26:22.240 --> 26:25.800]  important for you to understand the background of DARPA it's important for
[26:25.800 --> 26:29.920]  you to understand the background of the NSA to know that it was created by
[26:29.920 --> 26:35.600]  executive order by President Truman and when they were questioned on it on their
[26:35.600 --> 26:39.800]  abuses of what they did in the 1970s we had the church hearings and the Senate
[26:39.800 --> 26:44.560]  we had the pike hearings and the house and when Representative Pike asked the
[26:44.560 --> 26:47.760]  NSA and of course it's a big deal to have the NSA even appear at a hearing when
[26:47.760 --> 26:52.640]  he asked him show me what your charter says you can do because at that time
[26:52.640 --> 26:58.480]  they were spying on Americans illegally the NSA director told him I'm not going
[26:58.480 --> 27:03.880]  to show you the executive order that created us and he was absolutely amazed
[27:03.880 --> 27:07.440]  Congressman Pike said we're giving you tens of billions of dollars a year and
[27:07.440 --> 27:12.000]  you won't even show us your charter and he said yes that's the kind of dark
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.280]  secret government we have here's another example mint press blacked out pages US
[27:16.280 --> 27:20.640]  government snubs ACLU over targeted killing and a freedom of information
[27:20.640 --> 27:24.560]  request I say the US government gave the ACLU the equivalent of the middle
[27:24.560 --> 27:28.480]  finger in response to request for records on the targeted killing program
[27:28.480 --> 27:32.640]  an eight page letter from the director for national intelligence James Clapper
[27:32.640 --> 27:38.440]  this is a guy who lied to Senator Wyden saying that there was no surveillance of
[27:38.440 --> 27:43.560]  people just about a month before Ed Snowden released all of his documents
[27:43.560 --> 27:48.160]  James Clapper released this eight page letter to a couple of senators the
[27:48.160 --> 27:52.920]  Republican Senator Chambliss and Democrat Senator Feinstein and the eight
[27:52.920 --> 27:57.600]  pages were completely blacked out except for one sentence at the bottom says
[27:57.600 --> 28:01.120]  we hope this information has been helpful and we look forward to continuing
[28:01.120 --> 28:06.400]  to work with equity on this bill this is a kind of Orwellian doublespeak that is
[28:06.400 --> 28:10.960]  worthy of Terry Gilliams Brazil one of my favorite movies but you know what I
[28:10.960 --> 28:14.880]  don't like living in that kind of a movie and that's the kind of movie we're
[28:14.880 --> 28:19.200]  living in one more example in 2013 the ACLU received a response on the Freedom
[28:19.200 --> 28:22.240]  of Information Act request for information from the FBI on how it
[28:22.240 --> 28:27.520]  interpreted law enforcement's requirements to get a search warrant to put a GPS
[28:27.520 --> 28:33.120]  device on a suspect's car the FBI sent the ACLU two documents entirely blacked
[28:33.120 --> 28:39.720]  out 110 pages of blacked out documents were returned in compliance with the
[28:39.720 --> 28:44.280]  Freedom of Information Act that is the kind of arrogance that we have from our
[28:44.280 --> 28:48.360]  government and I'm going to give you some more examples of arrogance going
[28:48.360 --> 28:52.320]  after gun control shooting up hospitals at the same time yes that's our
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.480]  president and President Obama stay with us to be right back
[28:56.480 --> 29:04.800]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop
[29:04.800 --> 29:09.360]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[29:09.360 --> 29:13.800]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music

[34:56.520 --> 34:59.080]  product this is what some people have said about liver shield this is from

[35:41.400 --> 35:44.800]  things that have come out of this shooting first of all we this interesting
[35:44.800 --> 35:49.720]  article about one of the heroes that came out of this Chris Mitz there's a
[35:49.720 --> 35:54.840]  GoFundMe page for him and it raised a half a million dollars and just 24
[35:54.840 --> 35:59.600]  hours actually since this article has been written it's gone up another 223
[35:59.600 --> 36:04.880]  thousand dollars it was 723 thousand just before the show began when I last
[36:04.880 --> 36:09.040]  looked from what I understand of course it's not really clear what happened
[36:09.040 --> 36:13.480]  there but it appears from the narratives that I've seen that as the shooter was
[36:13.480 --> 36:17.760]  trying to get into another room he tried to hold the door back he was shot
[36:17.760 --> 36:23.160]  multiple times various parts of his body he was shot in his legs as well as I
[36:23.160 --> 36:26.920]  think his arms and hands but he's going to have to learn how to walk all over
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.200]  again if you want to try to help him you can find the address for that GoFundMe
[36:31.200 --> 36:36.480]  project in bedded in the article there talking about how people are chipping in
[36:36.480 --> 36:41.880]  to help him and again this is a veteran this is somebody who's been trained to
[36:41.880 --> 36:47.680]  respond quickly to run to the shot the sound of shots rather than running away
[36:47.680 --> 36:52.720]  just like these people in the Paris train attack remember it was a couple of
[36:52.720 --> 36:56.040]  months ago maybe I don't know if it was that long ago maybe it was just about a
[36:56.040 --> 37:01.400]  month ago but there was a would-be shooter got on a train and there were a
[37:01.400 --> 37:07.440]  couple of vets there along with a British citizen and they rushed the guy
[37:07.440 --> 37:12.400]  and subdued him before he was able to shoot other people on the on the train
[37:12.400 --> 37:17.000]  one of them was injured and the interesting thing is that one of these
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.960]  heroes from that Paris train potential attack Alex Scarlatos actually is a
[37:23.960 --> 37:29.360]  alumni of that same community college where this shooting just happened he
[37:29.360 --> 37:33.560]  said I would have tried to take him down and that's precisely what the the other
[37:33.560 --> 37:38.160]  veteran did you know we never know what's going to happen in our life how
[37:38.160 --> 37:41.840]  we're going to respond and it's interesting many of us I think look at
[37:41.840 --> 37:46.400]  this and say well if somebody pointed a gun at you and you knew they were going
[37:46.400 --> 37:50.480]  to kill you if you said you were a Christian what would you say I looked at
[37:50.480 --> 37:55.080]  that and it's you know I honestly I don't know I would say that I wouldn't
[37:55.080 --> 38:00.680]  deny Jesus but Peter said that and he did it anyway you know God's grace is
[38:00.680 --> 38:05.920]  big enough either way but the main thing that I can't understand is why
[38:05.920 --> 38:11.480]  people wouldn't run the rush the shooter I don't understand lining up and
[38:11.480 --> 38:15.080]  waiting I wasn't there I don't know all the details that people have said but I
[38:15.080 --> 38:20.280]  simply don't understand not fighting back not trying to save your life not
[38:20.280 --> 38:25.960]  trying to save other people's lives so regardless of what you would do in that
[38:25.960 --> 38:29.120]  kind of a situation I mean my first response would not be to give an answer
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.480]  and my response would be to run at him I would hope I would hope that if
[38:33.480 --> 38:36.440]  everybody were to run at him at least some of the people would take him down
[38:36.440 --> 38:42.400]  and that's essentially what is behind the idea of us having the ability and the
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.360]  will to protect ourselves that's one of the reasons we have the second
[38:46.360 --> 38:49.520]  amendment but the other reason we have the second amendment is it as a check
[38:49.520 --> 38:54.240]  on government power as I was just mentioning in the last segment talking
[38:54.240 --> 39:00.000]  about the way the government reacted to the nuclear situation during the Cold
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.720]  War with Russia back in the 60s of course there was the mutual assured
[39:04.720 --> 39:10.040]  destruction policy saying that well we're going to try to arm ourselves to
[39:10.040 --> 39:14.400]  the extent that there won't be a war that was the way that they approached the
[39:14.400 --> 39:19.200]  Cold War and quite frankly the second amendment is really a mutual assured
[39:19.200 --> 39:24.080]  destruction pact as well I've had many people say to me you realize of course
[39:24.080 --> 39:27.720]  that you're not going to be able to stop the military with all of their
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.600]  equipment sophisticated high firepower equipment that they have you're not
[39:33.600 --> 39:37.360]  going to be able to stop them with your pistols and I would always remind them
[39:37.360 --> 39:42.560]  of what happened in the Warsaw ghetto there you had a lot of people who were
[39:42.560 --> 39:46.040]  disarmed Jews were lined up in the Warsaw ghetto by the Nazis they were
[39:46.040 --> 39:51.040]  guarded by the Nazis and with a few hammers they got one or two pistols and
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.040]  then began collecting arms from soldiers that they killed and before long you had
[39:57.040 --> 40:02.480]  an entire Panzer Division that was penned down by citizens who had the will
[40:02.480 --> 40:07.800]  to resist that was what they needed was the will if you have the will you will
[40:07.800 --> 40:13.400]  find the tools firearms are simply tools and the only way they could put down
[40:13.400 --> 40:18.680]  that rebellion even with a couple of Panzer divisions was to burn the entire
[40:18.680 --> 40:24.600]  city to the ground we saw that recreated at Waco a few decades later on
[40:24.600 --> 40:31.400]  exactly the same day April the 19th so understand that we may not win wars but
[40:31.400 --> 40:37.400]  our government even with all of its firepower has never won in an asymmetric
[40:37.400 --> 40:42.640]  war and since World War two they've never won an asymmetric war they will
[40:42.640 --> 40:48.560]  admit it to you and that's what we need to understand it is a deterrence to
[40:48.560 --> 40:53.360]  tyranny you don't have to have a fighting war and we hope that doesn't
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.040]  happen just as we had always hoped through the Cold War there would not be a
[40:57.040 --> 41:03.520]  nuclear exchange it truly is a nuclear option but it has to be there that's
[41:03.520 --> 41:08.160]  why the founders of our country created the Second Amendment as a deterrence to
[41:08.160 --> 41:13.560]  tyranny if you don't have it what do you think is going to happen when I looked
[41:13.560 --> 41:18.520]  at the headlines and actually I saw USA Today paper a physical paper I look at
[41:18.520 --> 41:22.280]  USA Today online all the time it had been a long time since I saw the paper I was
[41:22.280 --> 41:27.920]  on vacation the headline said something to the fact mass shooting at school dot
[41:27.920 --> 41:35.040]  dot dot again again and when I looked at that I thought does USA Today do that
[41:35.040 --> 41:42.640]  when we have yet another case of police brutality do they put police nearly kill
[41:42.640 --> 41:47.920]  or do kill someone who is in handcuffs again do you really want to have the
[41:47.920 --> 41:52.040]  government be the only ones who have access to weapons do you want them to
[41:52.040 --> 41:58.320]  have a total monopoly on force I don't want to see a situation like that take
[41:58.320 --> 42:02.640]  a look at this article that is on info wars.com cops rupture handcuffed man's
[42:02.640 --> 42:07.640]  spleen they laugh at him they take pictures as he lay dying and begging
[42:07.640 --> 42:13.160]  this is a police sergeant and an officer they were finally fired 14 months
[42:13.160 --> 42:18.200]  14 months after surveillance video caught the officer violently kneeling a
[42:18.200 --> 42:22.840]  handcuffed man after rupturing the man spleen the officers ignored his pleas
[42:22.840 --> 42:27.720]  for medical attention for nearly hours while laughing at him off-camera later
[42:27.720 --> 42:30.880]  lying to investigators regarding the incident let's play a little bit of a
[42:30.880 --> 42:34.880]  clip of that no we'll do that when we come back we're gonna go to break we
[42:34.880 --> 42:38.000]  come back we're going to play a little bit of a clip for that of that for you
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.680]  and I want you to understand just as the Greeks said about power a fish rocks
[42:42.680 --> 42:45.720]  from the head down and of course we see this government corruption in
[42:45.720 --> 42:50.480]  Washington starting there and corrupting the police at the local level
[42:50.480 --> 42:54.360]  that's what we have to be aware of and that's what we have to push back stay
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.480]  with us we'll be right back Joe Biggs here with info wars.com now armed
[42:59.480 --> 43:03.040]  Air Force vet was prevented from stopping Oregon gunman article up by
[43:03.040 --> 43:06.920]  Paul Joseph Watson an Air Force veteran who had a license concealed carry gun
[43:06.920 --> 43:10.840]  was prevented by staff from intervening in the shooting yesterday at the Oregon
[43:10.840 --> 43:14.360]  Community College during which 10 people were killed John Parker was situated in
[43:14.360 --> 43:17.360]  a building about 200 yards away from where the shooting began there were a
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.000]  few people in the vet center and then we heard the shooting happened we got up
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.200]  and we were going to go over and see what we could do immediately the school
[43:24.200 --> 43:27.320]  staff stopped us and told us to get inside of the building essentially the
[43:27.320 --> 43:31.200]  staff wouldn't let us go to assist one courageous man who also tried to
[43:31.200 --> 43:35.240]  apprehend the shooter Army veteran Chris Mince ended up being shot five times
[43:35.240 --> 43:39.560]  Mince was unarmed in asserting his right to conceal carry Parker was knowingly
[43:39.560 --> 43:43.640]  violating a rule which declared the college to be a gun-free zone this is
[43:43.640 --> 43:48.560]  why we need to arm our students I guarantee you the students in Oregon
[43:48.560 --> 43:52.480]  wish they were had the ability to be able to defend themselves and those

[46:14.240 --> 46:18.600]  government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it
[46:18.600 --> 46:22.560]  be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary

[48:14.920 --> 48:18.800]  derived from our limited supply of deep earth crystals plus it funds our
[48:18.800 --> 48:23.920]  operation it's a win across the board a win-win situation as Alex says it's a
[48:23.920 --> 48:30.640]  360 win get your x2 nascent iodine at info wars life.com while supplies last
[48:30.640 --> 48:34.400]  and again we do have that in stock right now I want to go back to this article
[48:34.400 --> 48:40.280]  that was up on info wars.com about the cop rupturing a handcuff man's spleen
[48:40.280 --> 48:47.200]  laughing at him delaying calling for medics and this was all over a $60 bar
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.280]  tab that he was unable to pay so the guy who was arrested they roughed him up
[48:51.280 --> 48:55.960]  kicked him as he was handcuffed they kicked him in the stomach they say he
[48:55.960 --> 49:00.600]  was upset and injured after they left him handcuffed inside of a gel cell he
[49:00.600 --> 49:04.920]  then head butted the glass window on the cell door and then we have this
[49:04.920 --> 49:09.320]  surveillance video I want to play a little bit of this for you. This is what
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.760]  happened to 40 year old Robert Lease last August after being arrested by OPD for
[49:13.760 --> 49:17.840]  leaving a bar without paying for his drink. Lease's lawyer says after Lease
[49:17.840 --> 49:22.520]  head butts the holding cell window catching his cap in the crack Orlando
[49:22.520 --> 49:27.560]  officer Peter Dileo slammed Lease with a knee strike so forceful it ruptured his
[49:27.560 --> 49:43.000]  spleen and an artery okay so you can see that and what they're describing for
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.280]  those of you who are listening on the radio they're basically throwing him
[49:46.280 --> 49:50.040]  around after kneeing him they throw him around they say like a rag doll it says
[49:50.040 --> 49:56.040]  in the article then they delayed calling the medics when they came in they
[49:56.040 --> 49:59.200]  misdirected the medics and you can watch this video if you look at the article
[49:59.200 --> 50:04.720]  on info wars.com so here's the situation they were suspended for a week without
[50:04.720 --> 50:11.440]  pay finally in March they were arrested and charged with felony battery this is
[50:11.440 --> 50:15.920]  why we have to have videos this is why we need to watch the police but we need
[50:15.920 --> 50:21.000]  to also understand that these kinds of rules this this kind of engagement with
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.480]  the police this kind of bullying that goes unpunished is what is corrupting
[50:25.480 --> 50:30.800]  our police departments and it's being encouraged from Washington. When we looked
[50:30.800 --> 50:34.520]  at what happened in New Mexico with the shooting of the homeless man that drew
[50:34.520 --> 50:38.040]  attention to a lot of this is one of the first shootings I think really captured
[50:38.040 --> 50:42.200]  a lot of people's imagination of course this is going on continuously Obama says
[50:42.200 --> 50:46.120]  he's kind of kind of become routine to see school shootings well they're not
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.720]  nearly as routine as police shootings let me tell you or police beatings what
[50:50.720 --> 50:55.440]  is driving this a new curriculum was being taught at the New Mexico State
[50:55.440 --> 50:58.960]  Police Academy and a guy who had been an instructor there for a very long time
[50:58.960 --> 51:05.120]  says I refuse to teach this this is a shoot first curriculum I'm not going to
[51:05.120 --> 51:08.640]  teach people to shoot first that's what the federal government wants done though
[51:08.640 --> 51:14.400]  and that's what they are pushing they're also pushing a war a race war we
[51:14.400 --> 51:18.880]  have this article that's up on the dredge report today CNN turns the mixed race
[51:18.880 --> 51:24.040]  Oregon shooter into a white man and of course the LA Times also claims that
[51:24.040 --> 51:29.480]  he's a white supremacist the CNN did not show photos of his mother who is black
[51:29.480 --> 51:34.000]  they showed pictures of his father and they lightened the picture up if you
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.880]  look at that article you can see both of the pictures you can see how they
[51:36.880 --> 51:41.720]  pulled the color levels up there in Photoshop to turn the man white
[51:41.720 --> 51:47.360]  absolutely amazing they say that CNN correspondent Pamela Brown said that he
[51:47.360 --> 51:50.920]  had quote rambled about his hatred towards black men thus portraying him as
[51:50.920 --> 51:56.080]  a racist or a possible white supremacist the LA Times also portrayed him as a
[51:56.080 --> 51:59.640]  white supremacist they say a note that he left behind suggested that he
[51:59.640 --> 52:06.720]  supported white supremacist causes and opposed organized religion there we go
[52:06.720 --> 52:13.680]  and yet you see that where we had the shooting in Virginia the racial
[52:13.680 --> 52:17.760]  undertones on that were completely ignored they focused instead on gun
[52:17.760 --> 52:21.560]  control they didn't focus on the fact that he had been had followed the
[52:21.560 --> 52:26.400]  narrative from Obama from black lives matter from the southern poverty law
[52:26.400 --> 52:31.200]  center they didn't pay any attention to that whatsoever they focused strictly on
[52:31.200 --> 52:36.240]  pushing gun control and now we've got the father of that reporter in Virginia
[52:36.240 --> 52:40.720]  who was shot he's now using his daughter's death to make himself a
[52:40.720 --> 52:45.000]  Democrat Party celebrity pushing gun control his name is Andy Parker and he
[52:45.000 --> 52:50.080]  put out a USA Today editorial that says the Oregon shooting shows that we are at
[52:50.080 --> 52:56.440]  war now he's saying that they're at war with the NRA but no this is a race war
[52:56.440 --> 53:01.320]  this is a cultural war this is a political war of divide and conquer that
[53:01.320 --> 53:05.840]  is created by Obama by the media by the southern poverty law center by black
[53:05.840 --> 53:10.880]  lives matter that is funded by George Soros that is the kind of war that they
[53:10.880 --> 53:17.080]  are pushing you know wars are preceded by propaganda and that's precisely what
[53:17.080 --> 53:22.360]  they have done when I was in Oregon we were on vacation and we were in Portland
[53:22.360 --> 53:25.400]  Oregon we went to a it was an old elementary school that had been
[53:25.400 --> 53:28.760]  transformed into a hotel and a restaurant and we were just walking
[53:28.760 --> 53:30.840]  through looking at what they had done it was kind of interesting
[53:30.840 --> 53:35.200]  architecturally and so we're walking the halls I heard a presentation that was
[53:35.200 --> 53:39.080]  going on in a room there and I heard all these southern poverty law center
[53:39.080 --> 53:43.520]  talking points and I stopped and I walked over there and I took a little bit of
[53:43.520 --> 53:47.360]  video and I just kind of looked to see what they were talking about and up on
[53:47.360 --> 53:53.800]  the projector behind the speaker this was the title of the event that they had
[53:53.800 --> 53:59.360]  there the resurgence of hate crimes in America Charleston and beyond and of
[53:59.360 --> 54:01.840]  course they were talking about the white shooter in Charleston that went in and
[54:01.840 --> 54:06.640]  shot the the black Christians in a church that they're prayed with them for
[54:06.640 --> 54:11.720]  a while and then shot them but it was one week one week after this Virginia
[54:11.720 --> 54:17.280]  shooting did they talk at all about Vester Flanagan no there was not
[54:17.280 --> 54:21.360]  anything said about Vester Flanagan let me read you some of the stuff I I've
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.600]  got yeah you can get a shot of this I took photographs of their flyer this was
[54:26.600 --> 54:30.080]  a thing called race talks let me give you some of the topics that these people
[54:30.080 --> 54:34.160]  put out in race talks this is something that's run by a church that's in the
[54:34.160 --> 54:38.360]  local area liberal church some of these learning to be wiped that was one of
[54:38.360 --> 54:42.840]  their topics before this another one Islam a religion of peace and again the
[54:42.840 --> 54:47.800]  resurgence of hate crimes in America Charleston and beyond talking about some
[54:47.800 --> 54:53.520]  very obscure cases that I was not even aware of but completely ignoring the
[54:53.520 --> 54:58.200]  situation in Virginia where we're we were given a shooter manifesto that said
[54:58.200 --> 55:02.560]  he was attacking these people because they were racist because they were white
[55:02.560 --> 55:07.280]  and of course that is precisely what they are teaching in these race talks
[55:07.280 --> 55:12.080]  they want to say that you know the cross-cultural adoption and African
[55:12.080 --> 55:16.040]  American hair care now that's fine that's fine I have friends you know it
[55:16.040 --> 55:20.520]  wasn't possible for us to adopt a black child 30 40 years ago we tried in
[55:20.520 --> 55:23.400]  North Carolina they wouldn't do it I now have some friends who've done that I'm
[55:23.400 --> 55:28.640]  in favor of that I think that's a great idea there's so many children who are
[55:28.640 --> 55:33.320]  locked up in the system who can't get out especially black children because
[55:33.320 --> 55:37.520]  their parents many of them have been locked up in this insane war on drugs I'm
[55:37.520 --> 55:40.320]  not saying that the children should be given to the parents if they're addicts
[55:40.320 --> 55:44.600]  but I also know that there are a lot of people who are locked away in mandatory
[55:44.600 --> 55:49.320]  minimum sentences because of possession of marijuana something that doesn't
[55:49.320 --> 55:55.200]  necessarily threaten anyone nevertheless what they're selling here is the
[55:55.200 --> 55:59.800]  narrative of white privilege white people are evil only white people can be
[55:59.800 --> 56:04.720]  racist and that's precisely what we're hearing from the media and they're
[56:04.720 --> 56:09.840]  ignoring the war against white people that we saw with this shooter in Virginia
[56:09.840 --> 56:15.840]  instead we hear from this Oregon shooters dad he says quote that's what
[56:15.840 --> 56:22.400]  guns are the killers he said the guns are the killers you understand guns are
[56:22.400 --> 56:29.640]  inanimate objects okay they cannot run out and shoot people okay we need to
[56:29.640 --> 56:34.840]  have an investigation of this guy's background and we need to maybe we maybe
[56:34.840 --> 56:39.240]  we do need to change some of the gun laws maybe we need to make some of the
[56:39.240 --> 56:44.160]  parents civilly liable if they're unwilling to take any responsibility for
[56:44.160 --> 56:48.240]  the actions of their children as this parent is you got this Oregon shooter
[56:48.240 --> 56:53.320]  he doesn't he's the father of this guy but he's not responsible for anything
[56:53.320 --> 56:58.840]  no an inanimate object is responsible and we should take the firearms from
[56:58.840 --> 57:03.720]  people who have used them to protect their families we should take firearms
[57:03.720 --> 57:07.840]  from people who are law-abiding citizens who haven't harmed anyone but we
[57:07.840 --> 57:12.560]  shouldn't allow the guns are the issue okay he says don't buy guns don't buy
[57:12.560 --> 57:17.680]  guns don't buy guns three times he said guns are the killers no you need to take
[57:17.680 --> 57:22.760]  some personal responsibility especially if you're the dad of a mass killer and
[57:22.760 --> 57:27.040]  we need to look to see what this guy's background was he was on he was being
[57:27.040 --> 57:32.040]  treated for psychological issues and that is what we have seen as the
[57:32.040 --> 57:36.880]  underlying cause SSRIs do background checks on those register people who get
[57:36.880 --> 57:42.520]  SSRIs they're the ones who do mass murder suicide stay with us we'll be right
[57:42.520 --> 57:44.680]  back
[57:46.760 --> 57:51.000]  another major health threat this one in Toledo Ohio where everybody in the

[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.040]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:15.240]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we're
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:26.360]  going to talk about Obama's hinting at gun control actually at confiscation way
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.560]  beyond gun control now they're hinting at confiscation we also have this article
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:37.280]  that came out a new American is a creepy new US Army patch a pro-islamic symbol
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.080]  if you look at this picture is absolutely amazing on the one side they
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:46.240]  have crossed scimitar's in a circle that is actually the emblem of the Muslim
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:53.040]  Brotherhood and on the right we have a crossed scimitar's of the US Army in a
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.920]  new patch that they just put out and of course when we look at what's going on
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:02.240]  in Syria and we're going to look at that also this hour what's going on in
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:07.840]  Syria you have to ask yourself what are we doing there we look at the response
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.600]  of Russia and the back and forth between Russia and the United States this
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.760]  article from infowars.com quote they're hopping mad in the US and in Saudi
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:23.520]  Arabia and of course that is a comment from a Syrian ambassador we have to look
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.280]  at what's going on there we have to look at our ally in the area Saudi Arabia and
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:35.400]  of course Prime Minister Cameron has come in from the UK and said this is an
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.080]  evil man that we're coming after this is a horrible man Assad that we have to get
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:45.280]  out now he may very well be but I can tell you that I'm not seeing him be
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.840]  heading people in the streets like our ally Saudi Arabia I'm not seeing Syria
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:56.720]  invading other countries like Saudi Arabia our ally has in Yemen and so you
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.400]  have to ask yourself when you see this creepy new army patch where we got US
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.480]  soldiers now with an emblem that looks exactly like the Muslim Brotherhood with
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.000]  crossed scimitar's and the supposedly that's that's for the people that are
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.280]  going to be fighting ISIS I really have to question what's going on and at the
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:22.680]  same time that Obama is talking about gun confiscation we have him attacking a
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:28.360]  hospital this is what our our military has done in the last day or so in
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:34.840]  Afghanistan there was a massive attack on a hospital there killing 19 people so
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.040]  you have to ask yourself when we have an Oregon shooter who kills nine people
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.720]  that he singled out as Christians we have a president shooter who just killed
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:49.600]  19 people singled out in a hospital because some of the people in the
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:56.440]  hospital were Taliban patients that doesn't justify it except in the eyes
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:02.720]  of the US military and that is very very concerning you have to understand you
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.400]  don't attack hospitals you don't shoot red cross vehicles you don't shoot
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.520]  medics those are the rules the laws of international war there is a point at
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.200]  which we are supposed to pull this back but not the US military this was not a
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.480]  single strike we're going to talk about what happened but it went on for over a
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.440]  half hour and we have an article up on info wars calm patients were burning in
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:34.520]  their beds witnesses recall the horrific condos hospital airstrike how can a
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:43.480]  president get on a moral high horse and talk about a shooting in a in a college
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.360]  where they singled out Christians and say we need to take guns from innocent
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:54.600]  people when they do this sort of thing absolutely amazing hypocrisy maybe we
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.720]  should have some background checks for president instead of gun owners maybe
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:05.400]  there ought to be a waiting period for wars maybe there ought to be a process
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.560]  by which we declare war instead of just having the president go out and do it as
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.760]  a dictator yeah we have a constitution we have a constitutional law that he
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.400]  violates on a regular basis we also have international laws against war crimes
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.800]  which they also violate I want to talk briefly about what's going on in the
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.200]  polls of course and we're going to cover some of what's happening with some of
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.600]  the politicians as well as their responses to this shooting because that's
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.600]  part of the background check for president and this is one of the very
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.040]  few issues on which there is a substantive difference between the two
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.680]  major political parties on most of them they're exactly the same on the war in
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:52.040]  Syria on ISIS the policy is exactly the same but on this there's a difference
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:59.320]  and we'll talk about that when we come back stay with us Alex Jones here info

[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:05.840]  present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:12.840]  the problem from time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:18.680]  become too complex to be managed by self-rule that government by an elite
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:27.040]  group is superior to government for by and of the people the Alex Jones show
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.360]  because there is a war on for your mind
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:36.680]  hello me meet the real me welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:42.240]  your host on this Sunday October 4th 2015 we've been talking about their
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.680]  responses to the shooting in Oregon we're also going to talk about the shooting
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.920]  in Afghanistan the shooting of a hospital by our president who gets on his
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:54.520]  moral high horse and says that we need to confiscate guns that's what he's
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.240]  hinting at we have an article at infowarse.com talking about that I want
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.840]  to break down a little bit more of what's going on with in Oregon of course
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:06.560]  we have the article at infowarse.com so the Oregon shooters guns were legal now
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.720]  what changed the gun law well you know you have to if you can change the gun
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:14.400]  laws you need to change the second second amendment we've had a lot of gun
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.840]  laws that have been put on that are in violation of the second amendment
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.880]  already because the second amendment says you shall not infringe the second
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.200]  amendment the right to keep him bare arms and fringe means that you're going
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:32.480]  to erase it by chipping away with it at the edges okay like moving your fence
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.600]  onto your neighbor's property and if it gets left there for a long period of
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.520]  time the law says well he's accepted that and so now that property is yours so
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:43.560]  then you move it a little bit further that's the process of infringement
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.960]  that's the way they've been destroying the right to keep him bare arms it's not
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.360]  a privilege it's not something that is created by the second amendment it is
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:56.320]  something that is a fundamental right we possess as humans and that was set up
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:01.320]  as a prohibition to government so if you're going to enact gun laws you've
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.200]  got to get rid of the second amendment but of course we have a government that
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.720]  doesn't believe that they're bound by the Constitution that they take an oath to
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.720]  the Constitution that they appeal to for their authority they constantly
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.600]  violate whether it's the fourth amendment or the second amendment or the first
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:21.360]  amendment as they are doing in many instances we have a government that has
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:27.160]  created a massive war here on our own citizens a war on drugs that they have
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.840]  absolutely no constitutional authority for go back and look at the constitutional
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.640]  amendment that was necessary to prohibit alcohol where is the corresponding
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.520]  amendment to prohibit any of these things that they prohibit whether it's
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:46.480]  marijuana or cocaine or cancer drugs everything is prohibited unless it is
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.080]  expressly permitted by our government that is not the Constitution we had a
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:54.480]  government at one point in time that recognized the authority the Constitution
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.440]  they knew that they needed to have an amendment to the Constitution to give
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.920]  them the power to regulate and prohibit alcohol and then they repeal that and
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:08.800]  there is no constitutional amendment that gives them the power to prohibit
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.720]  drugs so they just ignore it so we could have the same thing happen with firearms
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.960]  even though we have a second amendment that prohibits that just like we have
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.200]  the government constantly violating our fourth amendment rights with the TSA and
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:27.800]  other intrusions by the NSA looking at all the information of individuals
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:32.560]  without search warrants but of course Obama mocks gun rights activists is
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.400]  another war article at info wars.com says that they are crackpot conspiracy
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:41.600]  theories he says they think that any gun safety measures are somehow an assault
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:48.440]  on freedom or communistic or a plot by me well where would we get the idea that
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:54.680]  gun control was communistic would it be that Chairman Mao said that power comes
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:59.080]  out of the barrel of a gun would it be that authoritarian governments have
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:05.600]  always begun by confiscating guns we did a video in the aftermath of the Sandy
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.840]  Hook shooting here at info wars we talked about democide the long history of
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:16.840]  death by government we showed how gun control preceded massive purges of the
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.120]  civilizations by the governments themselves the governments would turn
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.600]  against their citizens first taking away their guns and now we have Obama
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.080]  hinting at confiscation he says we know that other countries in response to one
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:35.040]  mass shooting have been able to craft laws that almost he doesn't even say
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.520]  that they eliminated shootings he says they almost eliminate mass shootings
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:43.240]  because you know what folks you do have mass shootings in places like Great
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.920]  Britain Australia and countries like ours he goes on to say those countries
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.360]  they did not eliminate mass shootings you can still have them there because if
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:57.000]  you're the only person with a gun then everyone is helpless but he is hinting
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.400]  broadly at that here's here's some facts okay this is from the Breitbart article
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.920]  that talks about that quote and they mentioned how in 1994 the number of
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:12.600]  firearms was a hundred and ninety two million in private hands in 2009 that
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.280]  increased to three hundred and ten million what happened to murder by
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.160]  firearm well it went for him from six point six per hundred thousand in
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:26.560]  nineteen ninety three to three point two in 2011 so let me recap that for you
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:34.880]  those numbers we had a sixty percent increase in private firearms and we had
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:42.880]  a 52% decrease in homicide by firearm you understand increased firearms in
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:48.960]  private hands decreased death by firearms that is the reality of this so
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.160]  maybe we should have as I said in the last segment maybe we should have some
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.720]  background checks for president maybe we should have waiting periods before
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.040]  they start wars maybe we should actually follow the law follow the
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.160]  Constitution let's look at some background checks here's what some of the
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.920]  people said about the push for gun control this is what Mike Huckabee said
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.080]  he said let's ask this question what stopped the shooter in Oregon yesterday
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.800]  what stopped him he said he was continuing to shoot but what stopped him
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:23.120]  it was a police officer with what with a conversation with a reading from
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:29.120]  a book no it was a cop with a gun that stopped him and Huckabee went on to say
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:34.800]  we've got a nation and a world in which people have just obliterated that sense
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.680]  of moral character of responsibility and of accountability for their actions
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:45.320]  nothing exemplifies that better than the father of this shooter saying that guns
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:51.120]  kill don't buy guns and we need to take away everybody's guns because he won't
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.600]  accept any personal responsibility for the actions of his son and if we're
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.400]  gonna put any new laws maybe we should add some kind of financial liability for
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.160]  the parents of people who do this type of thing because he's not about to
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.440]  accept any personal responsibility here's what Hillary Clinton says an
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.600]  article on info wars.com Hillary Clinton calls for mass movement to eradicate the
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:19.200]  Second Amendment she says she will never relent and what is she not going to
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.400]  relent on she's not going to relent in her war on the Bill of Rights because
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.560]  that's fundamentally what we're talking about but of course the way that she and
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:33.400]  others want to couch this is they want to have a war on the NRA Donald Trump
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.680]  went to Tennessee and he pushed his Second Amendment Protection Program he
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.360]  had 3,000 people waiting to hear him it was a sellout standing room only crowd
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.320]  he had a thousand people standing outside in the rain to hear him and he
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.040]  unabashedly waived a copy of the Second Amendment position paper that he has on
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.880]  his website he's got two position papers that are very detailed we've talked
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.600]  about these in the past one is on immigration the Second Amendment was
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.600]  the second one that he put up it was in September the 18th and I thought there
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.920]  was some stuff in it that was very good some of it I wasn't too happy with the
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.560]  way that he set it up I thought might be some issues but again you know what
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.920]  overall I thought it was great position paper the question again with any of
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.440]  these candidates is do they really believe this are they really going to do
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.040]  what they say but this is what he's saying and it is always helpful to have
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:28.400]  people saying the right thing and what Donald Trump said now this is in the light
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:31.520]  of what happened in Oregon now every time something happens like this they
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:35.480]  don't blame mental illness that our mental health care is out of whack and
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:40.240]  all the other problems he said no by the way it was a gun-free zone well it's
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.640]  not just mental illness and that's one of the things that's tricky about his
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:48.960]  his program he did mention that a lot of Republicans understand that we have to
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.520]  understand that if people are going to have their firearms taken away because
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:58.240]  of mental illness we need to go through a full due process situation we don't
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:05.320]  need to have that done on the orders of one psychiatrist it needs to be treated
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:09.680]  as if you were taking away somebody's property or if you're putting them in
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:14.000]  jail they need to have full process they need to have a jury trial they need to
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.120]  have a lawyer present in that if they have due process I don't have a problem
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.560]  with that I have a I think that is a very dangerous thing to take people's
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.360]  firearms away though on the orders of a single doctor we've seen how that's been
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.360]  pushed in the VA administration saying that people were incompetent merely
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.680]  because they had their checks automatically deposited they used that
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.280]  that's how bad it can get so we have to be careful about that now we have and
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.880]  this is one more reaction I want to talk about this when we come back Joe Biden
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.560]  says that they you don't have a right in the Second Amendment to use a bazooka or
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.800]  a fighter jet that's not what this is about but we're gonna talk about somebody
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.600]  who is a terrorist who terrorized the hospital using jet fighters when we come
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.760]  back that will be President Obama introducing secret 12 the new info

[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:34.280]  jones info wars live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:47.240]  jones the last segment i was talking about some of the comments of various
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:51.520]  politicians of course hillary clinton says she's never going to relent in her
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:57.040]  attack on guns that's on the second amendment folks is what she's going to
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:03.480]  never relent on is her attack on our rights obama is hinting at all-out
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.920]  confiscation is being the only solution because of course there weren't any laws
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:12.800]  violated in the possession of this shooters guns so we just have to get
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:16.040]  rid of them all together that's obama's position i read you a couple of comments
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.840]  from as republican candidates huckabee who talked about personal
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:24.160]  responsibility who talked about the fact that he was stopped not with ideas not
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:28.440]  with a reading not with a book but he was stopped with a cop with a gun
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:32.040]  stopping him but of course actually he committed suicide but that would have
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:38.120]  stopped him much much earlier this went on for at least 10 minutes before the
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:42.560]  shooter were told committed suicide and then we have the craziest response and
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:48.560]  that was from joe biden who takes the assault weapon scare tactics to all new
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:53.240]  levels i'll tell you what he had to say about that and how this is reflected in
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:59.240]  what our own president is is pushing in afghanistan in just one moment before we
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:02.840]  do i will let you know that this hour the alex jones show is brought to you by
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:07.480]  products that we sell them for wars life dot com products like brain force this is
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:12.280]  something that i use all the time i found more than any of the other products i
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:17.400]  have found that i can feel the effects of this this is something that's different
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:21.000]  from energy drinks is different from supplements it uses natural brain
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.800]  activation ingredients things like your remate extract alpha gpc it already has
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.400]  hundreds of five-star reviews that you can read on info wars life dot com these
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.560]  are certified reviews by a third-party review system let me read you a couple
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:39.800]  of those about brain force this one is from whaler matt in Cincinnati Ohio he
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.800]  said this stuff is amazing in terms of computer ease it's like upgrading from a
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:48.760]  dual core to a quad core more pipelines in the brain are open to multitask i
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.280]  find myself not wondering in conversations when talking to others no
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:57.080]  harsh let down like caffeine or energy drinks another one from jonathan in
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.680]  fort worthy said this product is one of the main reasons i outperform all of my
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.440]  co-workers i work in a call center and i always finish the day with a better
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:08.440]  report than anyone else and i have brain force to thank for that so take a look
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:13.960]  at it see people who say that they found it useful or didn't find it useful most
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:19.240]  people did uh like i said it's got hundreds of five-star reviews there and
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.800]  you can get that right now it's in stock at info wars life dot com is something
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:28.680]  that i really do like is one of the products that i use the most now going
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:35.400]  back to what joe biden said liberals have always used the phrase assault weapons
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.160]  never really defining what an assault weapon is but i guess maybe now we have
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.720]  a definition from joe biden he says the second amendment
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:45.960]  doesn't say you can own a bazooka it doesn't say you could own an f-15 with
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:49.640]  hellfire missiles there you go he's taking it to all new levels
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:54.200]  let me explain something to joe biden because i remember when the clarence
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:58.280]  thomas hearings were going on that he had the biggest problem
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:02.040]  with clarence thomas's writings about natural law
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:06.680]  joe biden doesn't think that you have any natural rights
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.680]  joe biden thinks that you have government granted privileges you see how he
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:15.080]  phrased this first of all it's ridiculous okay there wasn't a bazooka
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.840]  or jet plane used in this shooting that he's trying to piggyback
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:23.080]  his political agenda on but he takes it from the standpoint
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.880]  the second amendment doesn't say you can no the second amendment is not about
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.320]  giving us privileges it's not about telling us what we can do
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.520]  it's about telling the government what it cannot do
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.760]  and that is infringe on our fundamental rights to protect ourselves
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.800]  from criminals whether they're individual criminals or whether they're
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:47.560]  criminals in the government and let me tell you something
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.840]  military weapons are protected by the second amendment
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.440]  muskets were state-of-the-art weapons that it wasn't uh
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.120]  uh it wasn't something that a different class of arms that the citizens were
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.400]  allowed to have no they relied on a citizen militia
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.520]  not a permanent standing army that was one of the designs of our country
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.560]  that we were going to be protected from foreign invasion from insurrection
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.880]  internally from tyranny internally by an armed citizen militia that would have
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.920]  everything that they needed to protect themselves
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.520]  those who are disarmed at concord and lexington
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:28.120]  by the british had not only muskets they also had canons and that's what began
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:32.280]  the revolutionary war so don't talk to me about
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:37.560]  what we are allowed to have let's talk about whether or not we have a president
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.960]  who is capable of controlling guns whether we have a president who's capable
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:47.080]  of controlling the military we have u.s officials investigating an
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:51.080]  airstrike in afghanistan they say on this is on fox news that killed at least
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:56.200]  19 doctors at a doctors without border hospital
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.800]  taliban fighters were among those that were in the hospital so this is a
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.880]  possible motive of the defense department
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:08.440]  we know that when wiki leaks showed uh via the uh
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.600]  the file that manning got and then published through wiki leaks
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:15.880]  we saw the military killing at a distance
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.920]  people on the ground we saw them shooting a guy carrying a camera we saw
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.120]  them strafing an ambulance when it came up
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.800]  what did our government do did it punish the soldiers that did that
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.600]  did it punish the soldiers that laughed about that
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.520]  did it punish their commanders for not doing anything about it no
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.960]  they put manning in jail they tried to put julian
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.280]  assange in jail and so now we have defense officials saying
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:46.760]  we quote regret the loss of innocent life they say the incident could have
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.760]  been avoided however if the taliban had not used the hospital as a base
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.280]  and the civilians there as human shields that's not
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.280]  what happened it is reported by the new york times
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:02.680]  that this was pointed out to all combatants there
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:07.240]  both sides that this was a hospital it is a war crime to shoot
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.880]  ambulances it is a war crime to shoot up the red cross to shoot up a medic
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.960]  this is why they have at least 19 people three of them reportedly children
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.400]  this is from a senior unofficial equated this to
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.520]  a war crime the new york times reports they were assaulted from the air for
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:26.840]  30 to 45 minutes resulting in a large fire that burned
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.520]  some patients to death in their beds among those killed
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.160]  were 12 of the charity groups staff members said the doctors without borders
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.640]  they say the event is utterly tragic inexcusable and possibly even criminal
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.920]  that is from the un high commissioner for human rights he added
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.280]  if established as deliberate in a court of law
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:51.800]  an airstrike on a hospital may amount to a war crime this is from our government
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:56.200]  who is pontificating now about this shooting saying they need to take away
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.440]  our weapons perhaps we need to take away some of the power
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.880]  from our president and from the military who did this
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.520]  they say the bombing continued for more than 30 minutes
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:10.680]  after american and afghan military officials in kabul and washington
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:14.520]  were informed they say 12 doctors without border
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.040]  staff members were killed along with seven patients again three of them
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.960]  children and we have the article up on info wars dot com
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.720]  patients were burning in their beds witnesses recall the horrific
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.960]  kunduz hospital airstrikes here's what one of the
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:33.240]  communication said they added that precise locations of its facilities had
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:37.080]  been communicated to all parties in the military conflict on multiple
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:41.480]  occasions with the latest communication being on september 29th
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.160]  the bombs they said were very precise the planes continued to circle around
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.200]  they continued the attack for 30 minutes this was not
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.440]  one mistake they were very precise and a continued attack for 30 minutes
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:55.640]  this is a war crime stay with us we'll be right back and we're going to talk
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.760]  about what's going on in syria just when you think the government couldn't
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.120]  get any more ludicrous the u.s. environmental protection
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:06.920]  agency has taken to social media to point out the harmful effects of
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.840]  sunny days on plant life that's right the agency tweeted
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:13.960]  think sunny days are good for plants not always
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.400]  sunlight causes ozone to form which harms foliage
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.120]  and weakens trees makes you wonder how did the planet survive for millennia
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.240]  before a big bloated government came along to protect it
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:29.400]  let's just point out the absurdity of the epa highlighting the alleged danger
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.600]  of sunlight as the world is facing numerous legitimate
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.440]  environmental issues some of which have been caused by the agency itself
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.360]  let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the animus river with
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.880]  more than 3 million gallons of toxic waste last month
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:48.440]  in an effort to cover up that disaster epa officials refuse to provide data to
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.720]  the press on the extent of the damage read the article
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:55.240]  obama's epa warns sunlight dangerous to plants

[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.120]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host on this sunday
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:44.520]  october 4th 2015 we have an article up on info wars.com
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:49.880]  quote they're hopping mad in the u.s and saudi arabia that is a syrian legislator
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.720]  and he's talking about russian strikes in syria
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:34:00.120]  the u.s media the western governments are pushing back against this and many
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:03.960]  people are asking well why didn't they do this years ago when we had the
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:08.280]  pictures of the convoy of jeeps and light weapons
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:12.680]  stringing for miles one a10 warthog could have taken those guys out they
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:16.840]  didn't do anything but we have obama saying that the russian
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.160]  airstrikes are strengthening isis is that true
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:25.240]  if it really makes them stronger then why would obama
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:30.040]  bomb a hospital in afghanistan because it's got a couple of taliban fighters in
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.920]  it unapologetically saying well they shouldn't
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:37.240]  have taliban fighters there and again they knew it was a hospital they
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:41.720]  continued the attack for over 30 minutes we had 19 people killed three of them
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.600]  children people were burning to death in their
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.840]  beds that could not get out of there but of course we're allied with saudi
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.760]  arabia they're trying to make a case for Assad being the most
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.280]  evil man on the planet that's always the case whenever we go after when we go to
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:00.120]  war you always have to make the bad guy a strong
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.640]  man noriega or you have saddam hussein who is
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:07.800]  taking babies off of ventilators all these things lies of course
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:12.520]  people who are previous partners of our cia then they become the villains when
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.480]  at the time is right to get rid of these people but what's going on
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:19.720]  right now in syria this article we have on info wars dot com is
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.320]  from zero head just says two days and this is two days ago
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:27.320]  we're now two days into russia's air campaign both moscow and the west
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.920]  are rushing to spend the narrative very true he says the u.s is portraying
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:34.360]  russian airstrikes as supportive of a murderous regime
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.760]  and an imminent threat to civilians is key now this is the same
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:41.640]  government says this is a threat to civilians the russians
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.840]  are possibly going to kill civilians this is the same administration that just
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:49.560]  bombed a hospital for 30 minutes in afghanistan
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.840]  that's how concerned they are about civilian casualties
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:56.760]  they go on and say in the article the notion that the u.s
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:00.680]  has now finally managed to identify the quote unquote good guys in syria after
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.480]  failing to get it right for four years and that now
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:07.160]  evil russia is deliberately targeting those good guys
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.840]  simply because they're the good guys is laughable to the point one wonders
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:15.000]  if cnn and others pushed back on being compelled to spin it
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.840]  that way it's such a ridiculous narrative and this of course is what the
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:22.600]  lawmaker says he says they're hopping mad in saudi arabia the u.s and qatar
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:25.800]  because of their defeat and because of the victory of russia
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.560]  and syria and the unraveling of the fact that the u.s and its allies are not
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:34.280]  serious about fighting isis that's the takeaway folks
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:37.880]  we're not serious about fighting them we created them
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:41.720]  we could have taken them out at any point and that's the point
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.960]  that putin is making when he talks about this but here's what obama had to say
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:51.160]  when he went to the u.n let's play that clip isle has now lost nearly a third of
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:54.760]  the populated areas in iraq that it had controlled
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:58.840]  18 countries are now helping to train and support iraqi forces
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:03.720]  including sunni volunteers who want to push isle out of their communities
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:07.560]  isle has been pushed back from large sections of
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.760]  northeastern syria including the key city of
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.120]  talabiad putting new pressure on its stronghold
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.360]  of raka and isle has been cut off from
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.200]  almost the entire region bordering turkey
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:26.680]  together we're pursuing a comprehensive strategy that is informed by our success
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:31.160]  over many years in crippling the al-qaeda core in the tribal
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.520]  regions of afghanistan and pakistan and we are
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:42.680]  harnessing all of our tools military intelligence economic development
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:46.200]  yeah really and they're not doing anything folks we know that this is
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:50.680]  going on for quite some time they tried propaganda methods to
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:54.600]  start a war by saying that there was a seren gas attack on people by the
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.480]  syrian government that was totally debunked we showed that as a false flag
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:03.400]  and the russians are pointing out that there is no moderate opposition
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.600]  in syria this is an article in info wars dot com
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.360]  they say i don't think this is uh vladimir putin's spokesperson he says i
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.760]  don't think anyone has yet explained what moderate opposition is
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.640]  putin demonstrated quite active interest in the issue
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.240]  and asked in which way the moderate opposition was different
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:25.000]  from the m moderate opposition yeah i remember it was mccain who met with the
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.680]  moderate leaders and now they've outed themselves as
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:33.480]  isis leaders remember that story from about a week and a half ago and of
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:36.680]  course where did these guys come from these particulars love these particular
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:40.280]  leaders that were uh that mccain and others met with
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:45.640]  they were chechen jihadis islamicists that were being used against russia
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.320]  that's why russia is upset about this of course they're allied
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:52.440]  with syria there's some other geopolitical issues going on they've
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.680]  been syria's ally for a very long time but they also understand
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:00.600]  that islamic terrorists have been used as proxies
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.880]  for the u.s government and the cia we are creating this cancer that is
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.840]  building and metastasizing all over the world
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.760]  and russia is attacking it the very fact that the u.s has been caught
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:17.080]  repeatedly arming and training and bringing these chechen rebels and
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.120]  infiltrate syria and then not attacking them
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.120]  that is all very telling that they are our cancer that we're trying to
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:29.640]  unleash on the world why so that the u.s can have an excuse to build up the
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.200]  military industrial complex they want a new cold war they want a new arms race
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:37.720]  they want an arm race for terrorism they want the police
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:41.480]  surveillance state to ramp up so they want there to be a permanent war against
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:44.200]  terrorists so they have to create a terrorist threat and now
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.520]  they bring russia into it because they want to get the big guns out there
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:52.200]  so the military industrial complex i imagine is is upset because they're
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.880]  you can't really justify strategic fighter bombers you know the really
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:59.000]  big take ticket items there you know as the guy as
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.760]  george c scott said and and dr. strange i've you know i see these guys come
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.600]  running really really low it's amazing to see it well it's also amazing
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.440]  to pay for this and that's what the military industrial complex wants they
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.880]  want an excuse to have a new cold war and they're
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:17.000]  starting a new cold war but let's look at what's happening in syria
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.920]  when isis our surrogates come in they have 11 rules for christians and these
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.640]  rules sound very much like our ally
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:31.640]  saudi arabia is isis jihadists have issued 11 commandments for those who are
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:34.280]  staying in there you have to sign a contract you have to pay
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.680]  a tax that's imposed on non-muslims or you can leave they say
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.400]  but of course they have their their ids so they can't quite leave at the moment
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.440]  here's some of these rules they say the stipulations prohibit
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.880]  the establishment of churches they expose muslims
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:52.920]  to christian religious symbols so they don't want to have the establishment
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.440]  of churches they don't want any exposure of muslims to christian
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:00.920]  religious symbols and they want to ban possessions of
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:06.040]  weapons and trading pork or wine now two of those things sound very much like
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.840]  the obama administration don't they ban all christian religious symbols
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.480]  okay and ban possession of weapons the only thing that we're not getting from
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.920]  our people of course is the uh they obama
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:22.200]  and uh and washington haven't tried to ban trading
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:27.320]  pork or wine but it looks very much like the democrat platform these 11 rules
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.960]  from isis but we have to understand that saudi arabia
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:34.040]  has beheaded more people than isis has and they have
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:38.200]  attacked and invaded their neighbor yemen massive civilian casualties in
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:41.560]  yemen have you heard the american press complaining about what's
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:44.680]  going on in yemen no have you heard very much about
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.720]  the bombing of the hospital in afghanistan not really but you haven't
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.080]  heard anything about what's going on in yemen because
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:57.640]  that's our allies saudi arabia syria is not attacking its neighbors
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:01.080]  it's saudi arabia who is the real threat and of course as i mentioned
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:05.000]  earlier we've got this creepy new army patch this is from new american
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.680]  they show the muslim brotherhood patch and the us army patch
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:12.520]  and they both have crossed simitars on them they look very much
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:16.920]  alike so these rules as i pointed out from isis they look very much like
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.200]  democrat party platform now the russians say that the us is not
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:23.880]  bombing isis this is another article from info wars dot com
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:28.200]  curtain ammo pointed this out he said quote mccain accused us of striking out
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:31.720]  at us trained insurgents however since they've either run away
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:35.480]  or joined al-qaeda hitting them is mission impossible
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:37.880]  wrote one of the russian officials on his twitter account he said the us
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:41.080]  coalition spent a whole year pretending they were striking isis
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:45.080]  but where are the results of those strikes where indeed
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:48.760]  that is the fraud we know they could have done it we know they could have done
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.480]  it very early and they haven't stay with us
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:54.440]  when we come back i want to share some of the things that i found
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:43:00.280]  in philadelphia talking to survivors of child abuse
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.840]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop

[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:30.760]  talk about uh some of the things that i saw
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:36.920]  and experienced in the three cities that in my perspective were under
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:40.840]  martial law or at least a rehearsal for martial law
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:44.440]  let's understand that uh every time they have an event
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:49.480]  whether it is a super bowl or whether it's a papal visit
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:54.840]  it's always an excuse for the government to ramp up its
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:59.720]  security state and that's what we saw in massive amounts philadelphia was just
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:04.600]  beyond description i had to take a little bit of time off i was i was really
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:08.120]  really upset i felt like i had been in prison it was
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.520]  absolutely amazing and of course the level of security
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:17.560]  is really not an issue of the pope it's not an issue that i have with the pope
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.080]  i do have excuse me issues with the pope
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.920]  based on what he was doing here he wasn't here
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:28.760]  for a moral message now he was here selling
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:32.040]  an agenda and i want to talk about that and i want to talk about
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.440]  some of the people that i met some of the people that i interviewed there
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:43.480]  survivors of sexual abuse by priests as children and i have some very very
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.880]  gut-wrenching clips that i want to play for you in this segment before i do i
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:52.360]  i just want to let you know about the products that we sell here at infowars.com

[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:38.760]  now while we were there in covering this story of the papal visit
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:44.360]  i came across this mask of the pope uh in new york and we'll hold this here so we
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:47.160]  don't get any glare on it i actually took a picture i was in a white shirt and i
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:51.320]  held it up to my face and i had some uh real alert trolls that said
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:56.840]  that's fake that's photoshopped yeah you know but the question
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.360]  is i thought that was pretty obvious that it was fake it was a joke but
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:03.640]  the question is can they see through the real facade
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:07.080]  do they really understand why the pope was here
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:10.520]  and this goes beyond the problems that i had with martial law
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.680]  uh in philadelphia and elsewhere it goes to the agenda that's being sold and
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:18.360]  understand that the pope is being used as a moral
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.960]  facade and you know behind this mask of the pope
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:26.120]  there are other masks that are there he's in front he's putting a moral face
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:31.160]  on the issue of climate change and sustainability quote unquote
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:36.840]  and that in and of itself is another mask that is in front of global
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:40.680]  governance you understand there's multiple layers to this it's like an
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:45.400]  onion they weren't able to sell climate change as a
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.760]  facade for global government they haven't been able to do that on a scientific
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:52.200]  and political basis people see through the fraud even people who believe
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:55.880]  that there's man-made global warming see through the fraud of
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:00.280]  cap and trade of carbon taxes the indulgences that we're supposed to pay
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:03.720]  that are going to save the planet even if you believe
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:07.400]  that we have man-made global warming that is caused by
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:10.680]  co2 and again we've talked about that before now they're even going to cover
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:13.240]  that now even if you see that you understand
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:18.840]  that what's being proposed as cap and trade really is cap and tax
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.920]  you have to understand that's not going to solve the problem and you have to
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:26.280]  understand the pope came here to put a moral face on that
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:30.600]  and i have to say if he's going to try to put a moral face on it
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:35.000]  when he has rejected the traditional concerns of the
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.200]  catholic church in terms of traditional marriage in terms of abortion
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:46.440]  his silence on that his tolerance of all of those things
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:51.240]  and his tolerance of abuse within the church
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:55.720]  when he became pope two and a half years ago he said that he told the largest
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:58.920]  Italian newspaper in terms of circulation law
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:02.360]  republica he said that in his estimate there were
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:05.960]  two percent of the priests were child abusers that would be about eight
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:09.880]  thousand priests has he done anything to get rid of these priests
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.080]  no not a single one and you have to understand
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:16.840]  that when someone is a pedophile they don't just do it once and stop
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:20.120]  it continues on i want you to hear the story
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:23.320]  of one of the ladies that we talked to that is actively involved now in an
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:28.280]  organization called snap survivors network of those abused by priests
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:32.440]  this is her story about sexual abuse and i want you to see this
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:36.920]  and understand how the corruption has been institutionalized here's what she
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:40.760]  had to say snap because i was abused as a child
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:45.160]  from the ages of nine to eleven by a priest in alexandria virginia
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:49.720]  who um was a newly ordained priest and he came to our house and he kind of
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:54.600]  adopted our family you know he ate dinner with us he won a vacation with us
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:58.200]  um he became like a member of the family and i loved him
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:02.360]  and i adored him and he used that to start abusing me
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:07.320]  and i didn't tell anyone until the age of forty eight because he told me i'd go
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:10.120]  to hell and also because i was raised catholic
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:15.160]  and um the nuns had told me that he was sent by god
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:19.480]  and so i thought he was sent by god to punish me and that i was a bad person
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:23.800]  and so i decided to go to the church and i thought they're gonna
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:27.160]  they're gonna help me they're gonna be compassionate they're gonna make me feel
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:29.640]  better and so i went to the church and the first
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:34.040]  priest i spoke to i cried for over an hour telling him my story and i told
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.760]  him that i felt like i was going to hell
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:40.360]  and that i didn't think god loved me anymore and that this was my fault and i
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:43.400]  was a bad person and at the end of that meeting
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:47.960]  i didn't get any reassurances from him and i felt so abandoned that i pulled
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:51.320]  away from the church and i also pulled away from god
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:56.040]  and at that point i didn't know what to do grooming is what uh a predator often
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:59.800]  does not only with a child but let's cut that short now there were they were
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:02.680]  both setting there were pictures of themselves at the time that they were
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:06.120]  abused and uh i want to cut that definition that's
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:09.240]  very important that you understand what grooming is but i want you to hear
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:13.160]  what they had to say about changing the statute of limitations because that's
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.400]  one of the things that they were most concerned about is there's a very
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:19.400]  short statute of limitations most people who are abused as children
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:22.680]  don't come out about that until they're in their mid to late
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:28.360]  40s and there was a hearing in virginia and the only person to show up and
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:31.720]  speak against changing the statute of limitations
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.920]  was the catholic arch bishop here's what they had to say about that
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:41.640]  bishop fen who was convicted of endangering children and in kansas
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:45.160]  city and he couldn't even teach ccd in his own
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:49.000]  diocese but yet for two years he remained the bishop
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.080]  and when he did resign it was quietly no one said he
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:56.840]  resigned because he endangered children he got to keep his title
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:01.000]  his honors so that doesn't act as a deterrent to any other bishop you know
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.960]  you abuse it's okay you can go ahead and keep your
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:07.640]  honors and so forth and and you know what kind of answer is that for
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:11.560]  protecting children the archbishop during the last grand jury
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.400]  investigation and there have been two here in
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:19.720]  philadelphia uh justin regali when he when the grand jury report was handed
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.680]  down i believe there were 37 predators still in
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.200]  ministry and through the grand jury and the trials of
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:30.200]  monsignor lin who was convicted of moving knowingly moving child
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.160]  predators and endangering children and he is in prison
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:37.400]  for that part he played but cardinal regali
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:42.200]  quietly resigned he's living a life completely he hasn't lost his title
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:46.040]  hasn't lost his paycheck and this weekend we've noticed him in the front
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:49.800]  pew here at all the festivities he's being
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:56.520]  honored and yet he left in disgrace so to us the message is if you protect the
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.600]  predators if you keep the church a secret if you keep the lid on the scandal
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.480]  you'll be rewarded not you'll be held accountable
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.240]  so how do you take the pope's words of children important
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.320]  the families or everything and then square that with
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:14.840]  well if you protect the predators who are raping the kids it's okay
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.760]  i think the number is less than two percent of pedophiles are convicted
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:21.880]  and uh it's because of the statute of limitations
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:26.280]  and the government's research says anyone who sexually abuses a child
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:29.480]  doesn't come forward till they're in their mid to late 40s
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:35.400]  so for most in most states then they are beyond the statute of limitations and
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:40.840]  the predator is free to go on and abuse again the department of justice needs to
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:45.240]  put in incentives out there for states to change the statute of limitation or
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:50.200]  better yet abolish it so that you know you can't hide behind the
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:53.160]  statute of limitations and the churches certainly
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:57.800]  hid behind the statute of limitations uh when reforms have come up and
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:01.000]  right now there's a bill before the new york legislature
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.320]  pennsylvania and washington dc all the places the pope has been and the only
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:08.120]  opposition they're facing is the catholic church
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:12.760]  so the pope could say bishops you may not oppose
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:16.360]  these law reforms that will make it easier for victims to come forward and
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.000]  not only that you should be let's cut it right there you have to
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.840]  understand the only opposition they had to speak against this was a catholic
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:26.520]  archbishop and what he said to them was this will affect my priests
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:31.320]  understand the cynicism of a pope who comes here to make a moral case for
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:35.720]  climate change and yet he goes to the very site
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:39.000]  where there's been the worst abuse in philadelphia and he has
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.440]  a world meeting of families that's the cynicism
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:58:06.520]  that's the facade you need to see through
