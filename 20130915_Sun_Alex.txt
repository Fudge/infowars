[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:35.000]  You take my life, but I'll take yours too. You fire musket, but I'll run you through.
[00:35.000 --> 00:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now Sunday, the 15th day of September, 2013, we're live and broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  We have a very important edition of the transmission lined up today.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  Obviously, the situation with Syria was always about Iran.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  And now we have seen Obama come out and say, oh, yeah, we'll take your peace deal.
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  But we still may attack you so that no peace deal can be made on the chemical weapons.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  And then now they're saying Iran needs to be included in disarmament talks if we won't attack Syria.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  So see, there's no way to make peace with the globalists.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  And they know that Syria has not been demonized like Iran.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  And so they're now conflating the two.
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  And the two are connected.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  One is run by a secular Shia connected and Shiite connected group.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  And the other, of course, is purely a Shiite state Iran.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  But the establishment knows the general public can't even find these places on a map.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  They're engaged in just a huge manipulation.
[01:46.000 --> 01:57.000]  But what I first want to get into is the fact that more evidence has come out that the rebels themselves launched the last round,
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  the third round of chemical weapons attacks three weeks ago.
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  And that the whole world is waking up to that fact.
[02:05.000 --> 02:17.000]  And so Obama gave a interview to Snot Anophilus, George Snot Anophilus, where they engage in the confidence game of laughing and saying,
[02:17.000 --> 02:26.000]  no one in the world believes that the rebels, those wascally rebels used any of the chemical weapons.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  So we're going to be going into that.
[02:28.000 --> 02:34.000]  It's like Al Gore used to say, no one believes there's no real scientists that believe
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  man made global warming is not real.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  There's no one, not one scientist.
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  There is 100% consensus.
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  Really, even NASA's come out last week and admitted the Northern ice sheets the biggest ever recorded.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  Al Gore predicted Arctic summer ice would disappear in 2013.
[02:56.000 --> 02:57.000]  It didn't.
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.000]  It got record big.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  Earth gains a record amount of sea ice in 2013.
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.000]  Earth has gained 19,000 Manhattan's of ice since the date last year, the largest increase on record.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  And that is directly linked to NASA from climate depots.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  CNS News, you name it.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  And then the Wall Street Journal says dialing back the alarm on climate change.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  You mean on paying the globalist a tax on all human activity.
[03:21.000 --> 03:27.000]  But remember, there's total consensus that if you don't pay Al Gore and Lord Rothschild and the Rockefellers,
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.000]  I mean, look at who actually runs these mercantile exchanges in London and Chicago that we're all dead, basically.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  So we've got that piece of news.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  Serious problems, though, we've always had floods on this planet.
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  It's been still terrible.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  Al Gore's out saying, see, this is evidence of climate change.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  Colorado braces for more heavy rain, devastating floods.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  And we've got upwards of 500 unaccounted for.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  So they're hoping hundreds aren't dead.
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.000]  It's 25 dead, at least there from flooding in a place that's been in a five year drought.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  So when it rains, it pours.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  There's thousands of micro climates on this planet.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  So you're always going to be having issues like this.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  So you want to be prepared and try to take care of yourself and your family,
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  but certainly pray for the folks out there in the massive flooding in Colorado.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  But don't worry, Obama has declared a state of emergency.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  And he's on, he's on the way.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  Of course, it's really just local first responders and people that are actually helping out.
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  Citizens helping citizens.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  But don't worry, Obama and the federal government will grandstand.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  Now, all of that, we're going to cover first the serious situation,
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  the new developments with Iran, the U.S. run by the globalist saying they're ready to strike Iran any minute.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  That may be the distraction from the political implosion of confidence that they've seen.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  That may be the false flag.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  We're going to get into the attack on free speech.
[04:49.000 --> 04:56.000]  It's really mounting here from a multitude of different angles.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  All this and more key transmission straight ahead.
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  With over 3,000 years of historic use,
[05:02.000 --> 05:08.000]  Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses,
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy to use full production system
[05:18.000 --> 05:24.000]  for creating endless pure nano silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  Your self produced nano silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  For many who are new to silver that wish to try silver for the first time,
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics such as our two ounce nano silver nasal sprays,
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  our nano silver soap and our most popular product, the all natural nano silver gel.

[05:53.000 --> 06:09.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[06:09.000 --> 06:14.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[06:14.000 --> 06:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the 15th day of September on this live Sunday worldwide broadcast.
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. The news websites are infowars.com and it's a mirror backup,
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  but it carries some exclusive news, so it's not really a mirror.
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  Prisonplanet.com. You can follow us on Twitter at realalexjones.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  We also have several big Facebooks and more. You can find all that at infowars.com,
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  as well as the free podcast, iPhone, droid apps for the show, the free video feeds,
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  everything on the listen page at infowars.com or infowars.com for its last show.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  And please save those links, but also send them on to friends and family.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  That's how we wake people up.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  Here's what I want to get into first.
[07:23.000 --> 07:31.000]  The incredibly important developments that are taking place in Syria and Iran and politically,
[07:31.000 --> 07:39.000]  the different things that Obama has been up to internationally in an attempt to distract away
[07:39.000 --> 07:45.000]  from the seven big scandals that they have running here at home.
[07:45.000 --> 07:51.000]  And if you count Obamacare and its implementation, causing even his own camp followers
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  and useful idiot minions to freak out, if you add that, it's eight big scandals.
[07:56.000 --> 08:04.000]  But of all the scandals, I personally think the most important is the concerted,
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  conscious attack on free speech and on the press in this country.
[08:09.000 --> 08:20.000]  And in the last four days, there have been five different developments dealing with the attack on free speech.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  And they've also caught the IRS head who lied to Congress in our emails
[08:26.000 --> 08:33.000]  and directives saying target tea parties, libertarians, conservatives, Christian groups, pro-life groups,
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  calling them dangerous and saying we want to shut them down.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  Now, we already knew this.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  They've not audited one socialist or communist or Maoist organization that they run.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  And that's what these people are.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  They've not gone after one of those the last five years.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  It has been a reign of terror, even the New York Times has had to admit.
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  Wall Street Journal, Washington Times, we're going to go over all of it,
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  against anybody who is not basically left of Lenin or Stalin.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  By the way, and I meant to tell you guys to print this, and I forgot.
[09:11.000 --> 09:22.000]  I didn't mean the AP and World End Daily articles on the unbelievably out-of-control attorney general Holder.
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  No, no, not Fast and Furious, not all that stuff.
[09:26.000 --> 09:27.000]  No, no, no.
[09:27.000 --> 09:35.000]  I'm talking about the guy who goes to consortium meetings with big socialist churches and black churches
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  and openly tells them how to get around the unconstitutional, I should add.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  He openly tells them, ignore it.
[09:42.000 --> 09:48.000]  IRS rules on churches not being politically involved.
[09:48.000 --> 09:49.000]  That's now come out.
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  Well, of course, ladies and gentlemen, of course, that's the way this works.
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  Plus, the First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  The federal government has no jurisdiction over churches on what they do.
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  They could have giant signs outside saying vote for Elmer Fudd if they wanted to.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  It's called the First Amendment.
[10:10.000 --> 10:18.000]  But before we go any further, I want to shift gears into the big, big issue here.
[10:18.000 --> 10:27.000]  And that is the disintegration of Obama's credibility on the world scene.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  Even though Obama is a globalist frontman, a puppet, a figurehead, a logo,
[10:32.000 --> 10:39.000]  still his cult of personality has been very successful for a lot of different disparate special interests
[10:39.000 --> 10:46.000]  to really be able to loot and rob this country of its resources, its tax money,
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  and its freedoms in the last five years.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  More freedom, and many historians have agreed with me on this.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  More freedom has been lost the last five years than in 230 years before it.
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  So many historians have pointed out there's always an acceleration at the end of a curve
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  in the trajectory of tyranny.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  Once a free society loses its propulsion, you kind of drop out of the sky like a rock.
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  And we've reached that freefall point, but we've also reached the point where people are ready to wake up.
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  Now, you'll remember Obama had Kerry about three weeks ago come out and say,
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  when the chemical attack happened, that clearly Assad had done it.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  And then the rebels uploaded videos bragging how they'd done it.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  And then the Russians tested it and said it was the rebels.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  Now the U.S. military has come out.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  That only was on infowars.com and worldenddaily.com.
[11:42.000 --> 11:53.000]  But it is a U.S. military Pentagon report saying that they got test samples of it in its homemade al-Qaeda chemical weapons
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  and that it's clearly al-Qaeda doing it to get a war with Assad.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  There's a new national poll out.
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  75% of the scientific poll of U.S. military who were questioned said they were against the strike completely.
[12:04.000 --> 12:13.000]  And then when they talked to the people individually, well, there was one in what army.mil actually was linked over to military.com covering it.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  But I'm going to get to that in a little while.
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  It's in my stack.
[12:16.000 --> 12:25.000]  And the people they questioned said, we know no one who supports an attack on Syria backing al-Qaeda to be al-Qaeda's air force.
[12:25.000 --> 12:37.000]  And where you even found it was like 20% or 4% at 5% undecided and 4% undecided and then 75% plus percent against.
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  The point is, is that the military is against this.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  And when the military two weeks ago went to Facebook and Twitter with images in uniform holding up signs saying,
[12:48.000 --> 12:55.000]  I didn't sign up for the Marines, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, depending on what person it was.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  I didn't sign up to be the Air Force or the Army for al-Qaeda.
[13:00.000 --> 13:08.000]  CNN and others came out and said, because we were the ones that broke that, that we were full of it and that it was propaganda and fake photos.
[13:08.000 --> 13:18.000]  Now you notice they don't say that on CNN. All week they've been saying, arrest whoever criticizes this policy.
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  Well, you don't have a right.
[13:20.000 --> 13:28.000]  You have a duty under the Bill of Rights Constitution, under the oath you swear, and under the Nuremberg Code from 1946.
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  If you want to look up that up or watch a historical film, it's excellent.
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.000]  Judgment at Nuremberg, following orders makes you just as guilty as those that give you legal orders.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  You have a duty, not just a right, to say no to unlawful orders.
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  I mean, if you know al-Qaeda is the main force, there's new studies.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  British government says half of them are al-Qaeda. CFR says 60%.
[13:52.000 --> 14:00.000]  If you know the main group is al-Qaeda and you're giving them arms and al-Qaeda, the head of al-Qaeda last week was in Reuters Friday.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  In fact, pull that out of the stack. Guys, I forgot that piece of news.
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.000]  And Reuters saying, attack the U.S. after Syria, and he's the head of al-Nusra.
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  Well, he's also the head of al-Qaeda.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  But Zawa Heery, so the military knows this is al-Qaeda.
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  They know Assad didn't offensively attack anybody, and it's known that for two and a half years,
[14:24.000 --> 14:32.000]  the U.S. has been funding the rebels on record to invade from Turkey, Jordan, Iraq,
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  and some support from Israel over the Golan. That's all on record.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  Yeah, there it is. Al-Qaeda chief calls for attacks on U.S. and 9-11 speech to followers.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  The leader of al-Qaeda has called on Muslims to wage attacks to the United States
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  to wreak instability that will bleed America economically.
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  And then you go read, Paul pointed out, by the way, this is also the head of al-Nusra, on record,
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  that our government has been arming for two and a half years, at least.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  Now Obama admits it all, and so Russia comes down and says, listen,
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  we'll attack Syria if you can prove, we'll help you if you can prove a launch chemical attack.
[15:12.000 --> 15:19.000]  But we've tested it, it's the rebels who stand again to have you come in and bomb everything,
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  and you know that, you probably told them to do it.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  And they go, oh, no, no, that's not true. He says, we'll find.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  Bring the UN in, whatever. If they have legal chemical weapons in Syria, everybody has them.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  Israel has them. We'll just give them up.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  And Obama goes, I'll take your peace deal, but I'm still going to go ahead and bomb you.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  That's in the news. So the Russians go, well, that's no deal.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  So then they get on the media here and say, oh, the Russians withdrew the deal.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  Do you understand that? Now they're saying Iran has to give up its weapons or they'll strike Syria.
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  It's like if your neighbor doesn't quit beating his wife, we're going to blow up your house.
[15:55.000 --> 16:00.000]  I mean, it is just insanely criminal what Obama is doing.
[16:00.000 --> 16:06.000]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  Supernatural silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current,
[16:32.000 --> 16:38.000]  making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[16:38.000 --> 16:44.000]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally and our silver gel can be used topically.
[16:44.000 --> 16:50.000]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,

[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:36.000 --> 20:44.000]  By the way, in the last half of the next hour, we're going to have in-studio
[20:44.000 --> 20:51.000]  members of a major pro-second amendment group here in Texas where we broadcast from worldwide.
[20:51.000 --> 20:58.000]  Texas Open Carry. We're all over the state. There are resting people that legally and lawfully open carry.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  And we had reporters downtown where this happened twice on Friday,
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.000]  including a combat veteran in a wheelchair.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  And they even read the police, our reporter, Jacarie Jackson. This made national news.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  The blaze of people picked it up and didn't give us any credit.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  I don't care as long as the second amendment gets defended.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  And we covered it. The video is up on infowars.com.
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.000]  And the police said, we don't care what the law says.
[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  We're officers. We can do whatever we want. That's what they tell them now.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  That's what Nixon said. It's like the president can do whatever he wants.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  It doesn't matter what the law says.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  I heard the Austin Police Chief a couple weeks ago on 590 AM, our local affiliate,
[21:40.000 --> 21:46.000]  with the morning crew there saying, well, if a police officer gives you an order,
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  you do it even if it's wrong and you won't get hurt.
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  I mean, that's like what they say, you know, get in the car and you won't get hurt.
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  Here's the candy. Here's the puppy dog. I mean, it's just like you hear something like that.
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  And it's like, wow, so there's no unlawful order.
[22:02.000 --> 22:10.000]  Of course, the Constitution Bill of Rights, common law, jurisprudence, it all states.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  It's on the books and all 50 states that you have a right and a duty to protect yourself
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.000]  of a police officer is endangering your life outside of their sworn oath and duty.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  And there's many cases of rogue cops that people have had to deal with.
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  And you don't go to prison for that. I mean, it's not like they're God.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  They're the Queen of England, the King of England.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  And so you do something to them. They're infallible.
[22:33.000 --> 22:39.000]  The King of England has not been infallible since 1215, since the Battle of Runnymede.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  And if the King of England is not infallible, is a cop infallible.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  And we're not here to bash police, folks.
[22:45.000 --> 22:51.000]  They've been very resistant to a lot of the New World Order programming and takeover stuff that's happened.
[22:51.000 --> 22:58.000]  But it is really creepy to see police all over the country arrest people with cameras in public
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.000]  and charge them with eavesdropping when that's not eavesdropping on record.
[23:03.000 --> 23:09.000]  They don't care. You can beat the rap. You can't beat the ride. It is official oppression.
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  And to see police choke pro-liberty protesters that protest on the street corner.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  And we've interviewed folks that that's happened to. I mean, it really shows an authoritarianism.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  And when we get to the next segment, I'm going to show where it's coming from the top.
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.000]  And we, the people, need to rein this in. Only a free people will be free.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  Only people that stand up and demand their rights will be free.
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  If you lay down, folks, you will ensure tyrants take over.
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000]  Now, let's get into Obama's incredible lies on Syria.
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  And President Putin has become your unlikely partner in this.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  And, you know, even in this op-ed, which has started up a lot of controversy here in the United States,
[23:49.000 --> 23:54.000]  he said there's every reason to believe that the rebels are the ones who use the chemical weapons.
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  So does that tell you he's willing to lie to protect Assad?
[23:57.000 --> 24:05.000]  Well, nobody around the world takes seriously the idea that the rebels were the perpetrators of this attack.
[24:05.000 --> 24:13.000]  Well, I understand. What I said is nobody around the world takes seriously the idea that the rebels perpetrated this attack.
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  Now, what is true is that there are radical elements in the opposition.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  All right, let's stop there.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  Including folks who are affiliated with al-Qaeda.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  So, Kerry, I mean, let's go over just 30 seconds of lies here. It's a seven-minute clip.
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.000]  It take all day to cover it. But many of you saw it or heard it when it, you know, took place this morning.
[24:33.000 --> 24:44.000]  With Snufanophilus and his little cohorts there, Snufanophilus or whatever his name is, George Snufanophilus.
[24:44.000 --> 24:50.000]  Number one, ladies and gentlemen, there are people all over the world doubting it.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  The rebels bragged they launched the chemical attacks.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  The U.S. military is on record saying they believe they launched the attacks.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  I'm going to go to those articles in a moment.
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, the senator, Pat Buchanan, Alex Jones.
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck. I mean, you name it, are questioning it.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  The U.S. military, as I said, is questioning it.
[25:10.000 --> 25:18.000]  The Russians tested it last year, this March, and then again this time, and put out reports saying it's clearly gas used by al-Qaeda.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  It's homemade, not what the Syrian government legally and lawfully has.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  Just like France, just like Israel, just like everybody else.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  It's just illegal to use them under treaty.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  A treaty, by the way, Syria is not even a signatory to.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  Neither is Israel.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  And both sides have said when they sign it, they'll give them up or they'll be part of that.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  So there's line number one. Here's the problem covering each lives.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  There's too many.
[25:44.000 --> 25:57.000]  The big one, though, is saying that no one thinks that the rebels may have used the chemical weapons.
[25:57.000 --> 26:04.000]  In fact, can you back that up? I want to play that one more time because there's actually three lies just in the first 30 seconds of that.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  And this is head spinning to sit here and deal with this.
[26:09.000 --> 26:16.000]  The around the world takes seriously the idea that the rebels were the perpetrators of this attack.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  You wrote it in New York Times.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  Well, I understand.
[26:18.000 --> 26:25.000]  What I said is nobody around the world takes seriously the idea that the rebels perpetrated this attack.
[26:25.000 --> 26:34.000]  Now, what is true is that there are radical elements in the opposition, including folks who are affiliated with al-Qaeda.
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  Affiliated?
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  If they got their hands on it.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  All right, let's stop right there.
[26:38.000 --> 26:54.000]  John Kerry said a week and a half ago at the G20 meeting in Russia in St. Petersburg, he said that no one believes that there are any al-Qaeda or radicals in the group.
[26:54.000 --> 27:09.000]  And he said it days before that in the House and the Senate committee, forcing Putin to call him a liar and laugh at him because the Pentagon says it's 60% al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, and other groups.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  And so does the Council on Foreign Relations.
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  I have a new report out today saying 50%.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  The point is they're the main force.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  They're the ones our governments are arming.
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.000]  So now Obama has at least been forced to admit to that because everybody knows it.
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  See, they count on you being ignorant to get away with these lies.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  Now, let's go over some of the headlines.
[27:33.000 --> 27:40.000]  Obama's Syria deal does not mean U.S. won't strike Iran over nuclear program.
[27:40.000 --> 27:49.000]  Now, the deal is they'll give up the weapons if they will pull back the rebels, that's what they've been asking for, and won't bomb them.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  They'll end the war.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.000]  And they'll even have international talks and bring in elections and new leadership.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  Assad knows that's his only hope.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  He's got to go.
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  But the West wants to put al-Qaeda in to turn it into another Islamic state.
[28:03.000 --> 28:09.000]  They want to take down all secular states, including Egypt, where our government's siding with the al-Qaeda people against their government.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  So imagine they go, okay, Russia, you want to make a deal?
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  We'll let you turn the weapons in, but we're not going to make a deal.
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  Knowing the average American doesn't understand the basics of diplomacy.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  I mean, this is seen as so evil worldwide.
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  Here's another one.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  If the Syrian talks are to progress, the U.S. will have to include Iran.
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  And they're now saying the West may strike Iran instead of Syria.
[28:33.000 --> 28:41.000]  See, Obama wants a war to distract from losing, in some polls, 10 percentage points a month.
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  I mean, he is going to be at, like, a 10 percent approval rating in six months if this continues.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  I mean, he is in free fall.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  They need a war, folks.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  They want a war, and they're like, okay, we can't have Syria.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  How about Iran?
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  I mean, it's war, war, war, war.
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  So we're going to come back, break this down, and get into the attack on the First Amendment.
[28:58.000 --> 29:05.000]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[29:16.000 --> 29:23.000]  Supernatural silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current,
[29:32.000 --> 29:38.000]  making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[29:38.000 --> 29:44.000]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.

[33:47.000 --> 33:53.000]  is Diane Crash, CCTV operator, the government's now being forced to admit,
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  footage rounded up and destroyed.
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  We knew back when that happened in 1997.
[33:59.000 --> 34:05.000]  That the government, the British MI6 had asked the French to hand over all the footage.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  And they lied and said the cameras had been turned off where she crashed.
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  We knew MI6 had used commandos to kill her.
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  We knew she was alive after the vehicle was remote controlled into the wall.
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  We knew she told friends and family.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  Prince Charles says he's going to kill me if I marry an Arab
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  and make it look like an automobile.
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  If I marry an Arab and make it look like an automobile accident,
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.000]  that's all on record, folks.
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.000]  They killed her and the conspiracy theorist have been proven right again.
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  How many years later?
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  How many years ago was 1997?
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  We're talking like 16 years ago.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  16 years ago.
[34:46.000 --> 34:52.000]  I mean, boom, that's up on infowars.com out of the Sunday Express news in England.
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.000]  So that's just some of the news up on infowars.com.
[34:57.000 --> 35:10.000]  Also, I had it reposted up on the site, the video, dealing with the fact that firearms are being confiscated
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  from Texans that are totally legal and lawful.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  It's happening all over the country, especially under federal training.
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  As long as the feds say it, well, I mean, if the feds told God to sit out and shut up,
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  God would do it because they're actually God.
[35:25.000 --> 35:32.000]  Okay, let's go over the stack of Syrian news and the different ways that they've been contradicting themselves.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  So Obama says, you know, turn your weapons and it doesn't matter.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  And the rebels will take your country over and kill every Christian in it
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  because, you know, that's what you do to get a peace prize.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  We're still going to attack you one way or the other.
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  So that's how the Jerusalem Post continuing here.
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  He says Iran should not misinterpret U.S. response to Syria.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  What the fact that our own military and our own chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  have all come out and said this is a horrible idea and a war crime.
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  And it's now an open secret that you run Al Qaeda.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  Amazing.
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.000]  Continuing, he rejects criticism of shifting Syria policy,
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  says I'm less concerned about style points.
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.000]  So now they're trying to spin the fact that they're floundering all over the place.
[36:25.000 --> 36:33.000]  Continuing, Putin is now going to travel to Iran for nuclear strategy talks
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  on building peaceful nuclear reactors in the country
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  and selling high-tech weapons systems to Iran.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  So this is starting a new arms race,
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  which I'm sure will make the military industrial complex happy to get our tax money.
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  Also, here's another report out of the Jerusalem Post saying Syria transported
[36:51.000 --> 36:58.000]  chemical weapons to Iraq last week when Iraq is still run by the CIA and the Pentagon.
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  I do not buy that for a minute.
[37:00.000 --> 37:08.000]  Continuing, Kerry is threatening saying I don't care what you hear in the news.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  Syria, he told AP, get ready to be hit.
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  The threat is real.
[37:15.000 --> 37:24.000]  Now, military.com is coming out with the Pentagon saying we do need 45,000 to 75,000 troops
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  on the ground to secure the weapons.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  And see, that's what Kerry said.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  Oh, well, if Syria implodes, then we'll have to go in,
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  but we sure our resolution calls for boots on the ground, but we're not planning that.
[37:35.000 --> 37:45.000]  The official strategy the entire time has been to implode Syria and break it in multiple pieces.
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  And to give Turkey a piece, Israel a piece, Iraq a piece, Jordan a piece,
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  it is completely immoral and is a war crime, and the West started it,
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  and we're paying for it, and our name is paying for it.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  This is on us, folks.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  The good news is only 9% of Americans support it in a Reuters poll,
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  and our military doesn't support it as well.
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.000]  But you heard Obama on Stephanopoulos' show, what is that, Meet the Press,
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  say that no one doubts our story, everyone's for it,
[38:16.000 --> 38:22.000]  even though reality is the opposite, lying to you to keep the facade going,
[38:22.000 --> 38:29.000]  that you're all alone in opposition to this war.
[38:29.000 --> 38:39.000]  Now, continuing here from Al Jazeera, Syria rebels made own Seren gas.
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.000]  Russia hands evidence to UN, which its envoy says indicates Syria opposition used chemical weapons.
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  That was in July of this year.
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  The flashback, they tested it after the March attack.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  And by the way, the Al Qaeda people on established Al Qaeda YouTubes,
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  well, they shut our YouTube down if somebody says a cuss word,
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  but Al Qaeda can have YouTube channels.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  They uploaded the video screaming Allah Akbar or someone been lauding America,
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.000]  you're next, I've played that audio here, The Arabic with the subtitles.
[39:11.000 --> 39:16.000]  Okay, I mean, there's no doubt they launched it last year, March, and then three weeks ago.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  Here is the article from infowars.com, a new one from Friday.
[39:19.000 --> 39:28.000]  US military Al Qaeda rebels produced Seren gas for chemical attack in Syria.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  That's Kit Daniels Friday night and guess who it links to?
[39:31.000 --> 39:37.000]  World Net Daily got a secret document and they have the highest credibility in my book.
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  They just continue to break big national stories.
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  You don't think there's whistleblowers anymore that are willing to risk their lives?
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  Folks, we break big stories all the time with federal and state whistleblowers.
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.000]  This is a Pentagon whistleblower gave them a classified document that's in the article.
[39:54.000 --> 40:05.000]  US military confirms rebels had Seren classified document shows deadly weapon found in home of arrested Islamists
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.000]  planning to use it in Syria, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  And then it was homemade chlorine gas type.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  Exactly what the experts have been saying for three weeks.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  Yeah, Al Qaeda wants America to come in and bomb the country so they can win
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  because the Russians and the Syrian military that have overwhelming support.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  Most polls we've seen in international press by Syrians living abroad is over 70% support.
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.000]  Even though Assad wasn't popular before this, the head opposition who isn't Al Qaeda in London
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  two weeks ago said an attack on Syria is satanic.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  In fact, show that in Reuters.
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.000]  I want to show viewers.
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  We're also on TV.
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  If you want to go to infowars.com forward slash show, you can find the video feed.
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  Week and a half ago said, I don't support Assad.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  Neither do I, by the way.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  I studied the situation.
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  Sure, I'm sure they could have something better.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  You know, George Washington, but he ain't around for the job, folks.
[41:02.000 --> 41:11.000]  The point is, is that, is that even the main real opposition leader came out and said,
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  this is horrible.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  We're putting Al Qaeda in to murder everybody that isn't Al Qaeda.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  They even kill Sunnis that aren't hardcore enough for them, folks.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  They're the Syrian conflict opposition leader.
[41:25.000 --> 41:33.000]  There you go.
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.000]  It's immoral to start the fight, to go in to try to destroy the country and to kill hundreds
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  of thousands of Christians worldwide, Islamists have in the last decade.
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  Tens of thousands of the 200,000 dead have been Christian.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  Two million Christians have fled and there's video online every day of Christians having
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  their heads chopped off that the news will not cover.
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  They are blowing up and burning every church, destroying every Christian village.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  They say, come out on video.
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  I've seen the videos and we won't kill you if you convert.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  When they do come out, they rape the women.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  They chop up little children.
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  I mean, Al Qaeda is about as bad as I can imagine.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  I mean, they are, you look at these people's eyes.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  I mean, these people are scum.
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.000]  I have never seen a group of more degenerate scum just looking at them and how they act
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  and how sick they are and eating hearts and burning churches and chopping nuns' heads off
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  after they rape them.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  It's okay to...
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  Oh, by the way, they're now saying they're going to invade with ground troops, as I said,
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  if they have to secure the chemicals, quote,
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  and so the boots are made for walking over the Christians.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  That's right.
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  The big red one, I guess, from the army is going to march in with Al Qaeda to murder all the Christians.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  So this song is for Obama and Al Qaeda.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  I guess I'm not patriotic unless I support them.
[42:56.000 --> 43:25.000]  So I salute Al Qaeda and Obama.
[43:26.000 --> 43:50.000]  Thank you very much.

[45:49.000 --> 46:04.000]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[46:07.000 --> 46:12.000]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  It all comes down to one thing.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  We are what we eat.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[47:31.000 --> 47:36.000]  Confess you're totally ruthless globalist.
[47:36.000 --> 47:43.000]  Who hate any free people like Christians in Syria.
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  And now the military's awake.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  And now the people are awake.
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  And now the world's awake.
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  These boots are gonna walk all over you.
[47:55.000 --> 48:03.000]  You hear that message, Obama and the globalist and all the big megabanks and all the big offshore interests that are above the law and tax exempt.
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.000]  Like Warren Buffett that openly lobbies to raise poor people's taxes to pay him more bank or bailout money.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  When you ought to be true then.
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  That's right, you keep lying when you ought to be truthin'.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  You keep losing when you ought to not bet.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  That's right, keep bettin', keep pushin', punk.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  You keep saying it when you ought to be a changin'.
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  You ought to be a changin'.
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  That's right and everybody knows it now.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  These boots are made for walkin'.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  And that's just what they'll do.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  You know what?
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  These boots are gonna walk all over you.
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  You know it's not one of these days, it's now these days.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  We've now gotten there.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  So here's to Obama and the New World Order.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  Henry Kissins, your David Rockefeller.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  This little piece of music's for you.
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  Oh, you're gettin' burned now.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  You openly run Al-Qaeda.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  That woke up the dumb-down public.
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  That's right, these boots are made for walkin'.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  And that's just what they'll do.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  As our whole military goes public.
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  So keep on walkin'.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  Again, I dedicate this to the New World Order
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  and everybody that wants to trample our rights.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  We didn't start this fight.
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  But you know what?
[49:34.000 --> 49:43.000]  We're sure as hell gonna finish it.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  Gotta love it.
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.000]  This song's for you, my little New World Order prettys.
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  I said I'd get out of the whole First Amendment thing.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  And I will.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  I'm gonna start that now and then go a little bit in the next hour.
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  Then we have some guests coming there to be in studio with us.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  One of them's a constitutional lawyer
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  and the other's one of the victims.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  He's a little gun confiscated by the state police.
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  Listen, slaves don't show those out in public.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  Might give other slaves an idea they're not slaves.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  They might think they can have a gun, too.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  And then that means the system's out of a job
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  and how's the state police gonna be doing proctology exams
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  on all the pretty girls,
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  whether they be pretty black ladies or pretty blonde-haired,
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  blue-eyed white ladies.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  Yeah, the whole country's even got foreign travel advisories
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  about coming to Texas,
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  because they do proctology exams
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  on the side of the highway now here.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  But that's freedom.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  We ought to put that on the Texas flag, you know.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  I bet one of my great-great-great-great-grandpappies
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  who raised Colonel Travis's son after Colonel Travis got killed,
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  I bet they would have thought, if they heard, you know,
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  one day in the future there'll be flying airplanes in the sky
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  and there'll be men wearing cowboy hats
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  that pull your family over and one glove,
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  two women, four orifices.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  That ought to be the Texas flag.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  I'm telling you, the image of a woman been over a car
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  with a state trooper right there with flies all over him
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  and a filthy glove.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  All I can do is illustrate the insanity by illustrating it.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  They're sitting there with the state police on video going,
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  here is the law.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  It is legal to have this firearm.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  They go, we do not care about the law.
[51:17.000 --> 51:24.000]  It's amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  So let me just ask the police something.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  Do you think you're being given all this
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  unconstitutional power just because the system cares about us?
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.000]  No.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  You're being given this because criminals run the system
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.000]  and they want to get you ready for a war with the American people.
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.000]  The globalists are ending our prosperity.
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  Everybody that works for the system should figure that out
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.000]  and realize FEMA demonizes the founding fathers,
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  the Bill of Rights, the Constitution,
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.000]  the Homeland Security publicly for a decade or more
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  has trained the police this.
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  Now all public with straight faces,
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  the Department of Defense teaches now not just officers,
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  but the enlisted.
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  This broke in judicial watch two weeks ago
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  and was on drugs for two days and got millions of readers.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  I know it was our news article linked to them,
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  so we saw the millions of people come in.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  So two million people in a couple of days read that, I know.
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  And folks are upset because it actually says George Washington
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  would not be welcome in today's arming.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  I want that to sink in.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  Folks that weren't in the army probably don't know much history
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  or army history, but anybody who's in the army,
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.000]  one of the first things you get taught at boot camp,
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.000]  I'm told, is about George Washington
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  and why would you be taught about George Washington?
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  He's not just the founder of our country.
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  He's not just the first president.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  He's something else.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  Who is George Washington?
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Who is George Washington, folks?
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  Are you thinking out there?
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  CJ, let me ask you in the control room.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  Who is George Washington?
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  Why would they teach at boot camp the first week you're there
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  about George Washington?
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  Why would they do that?
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  Because he's the founder of the U.S. Army.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  Absolutely.
[53:08.000 --> 53:13.000]  And then John Paul Jones is the founder of the Navy.
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.000]  But the whole issue is that George Washington
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  is the founder of the U.S. Army.
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  And he's not welcome in today's army.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  And you know why he's not welcome in today's army?
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  Because today's army is run by foreign banks
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  and is occupied.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  And I'll tell you what else isn't welcome
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  in today's federal government.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  Anything Americana, anything freedom-based,
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  anything not completely twisted.
[53:39.000 --> 53:44.000]  And now let me start and give you a little introduction
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  to what we're going to be covering
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  in the first part of the next hour.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  Here is the article in front of me,
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  Lois Lerner's Own Words.
[53:53.000 --> 53:58.000]  Emails undercut official IRS story on political targeting.
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  And she goes on to say in these emails
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  that are confirmed from February of 2011,
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  to say that the Tea Party is dangerous and scary
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  and must be shut down.
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  Well, yeah, that's what all the federal training manuals say.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  My God, these people talk about small government,
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  liberty, the family, the Second Amendment,
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  and worst of all, Jesus Christ.
[54:17.000 --> 54:20.000]  Whoa, sounds pretty nasty to me.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  Sounds pretty dangerous.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  People with the lowest crime rate, statistically,
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  I've seen national studies out on the average Tea Party
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  or lowest crime rate group.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  And these are really bad people.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Well, yeah, if you run Acron in the Chicago mafia,
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  I bet millions of people organizing around liberty,
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  common sense, and due process.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  I bet justice sounds pretty scary, don't you?
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  So you need to call it racist, terrorist,
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  everything else you can.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  And then have the federal government.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  You know how illegal this is?
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  If they get away with this, folks,
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  this is unprecedented.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  Targeting people politically.
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  They went after pro-life groups.
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  You can look this up.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  We've played the audio here at the seminars
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  and said to them that the pro-life groups take this.
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  We're going to arrest you for tax fraud
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  unless you stop praying at public events
[55:06.000 --> 55:07.000]  where anyone can hear you
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  and you need to stop protesting in abortion clinics.
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  The IRS has no jurisdiction inside of religion,
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  First Amendment.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  Plus, it wasn't around until 1913 anyways.
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  It's a private collection agency for the Federal Reserve.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  Learn about that.
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.000]  That's a fact, folks.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  Not some pipe dream here.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  We deal in facts here.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  They're stubborn things.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  Now, this is what's more interesting.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  Earlier this year in the IRS hearings,
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  I'm going to do a news piece on this Monday.
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  We got busy Friday, but I'm going to go back.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  We'll just type it in now.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  IRS, lowest learner testifies they did not target Tea Party.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  And you'll get the exact date on C-SPAN.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  You'll get news.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  What was it, six months ago?
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  I mean, just type.
[55:49.000 --> 55:50.000]  Yeah, it was six months ago,
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  but we've got a skeleton crew.
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  There are only three guys,
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  but search engine that for me.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  So I'll give people an actual date here.
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  But you all know she said it.
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  The Fast and Furious, Kingpin, Holder said it.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  They all said, ridiculous.
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.000]  We don't target anybody.
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  Folks, it's now come out.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  They targeted libertarian, conservative, veterans,
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  rights groups to get veterans funding
[56:11.000 --> 56:16.000]  that they deserve, their healthcare, gun groups,
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  Christian groups, First Amendment groups,
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  basically any type of American activity.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  This is like, no exaggeration,
[56:26.000 --> 56:32.000]  50 times worse than the Red Scare and McCarthyism,
[56:32.000 --> 56:33.000]  where they just pressured corporations
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  to blackball people and stuff.
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  This is actually going and arresting and harassing
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  and auditing and telling people what they can pray.
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.000]  I mean, this is naked, on steroids, authoritarianism.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  And there it is.
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  Lois Lerner pleads the fifth.
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  The IRS probes aren't just potential.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  Yeah, but see, here's the deal.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  She pled the fifth, but then went on to say,
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  I plead the fifth, so it wouldn't.
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  I guess she thought being record,
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  but lawyers pointed out it would be.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  And then said she didn't do it.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  Remember playing the clip.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  The fifth means you plead the fifth for self-incrimination
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  and then shut up.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  Everything you say after that is admissible.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  Do you understand that, you witch?
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  And I'm telling you, folks, everybody I know,
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  including us, has been jacked with by the IRS
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  and terrorized.
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  Don't even get into it on air,
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  because it doesn't bother me.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  It means I'm over the target.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  The old Air Force saying it was Army Air Corps,
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  my grandpa was in it.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  How do you know when you're over the target,
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.000]  when you're taking the flag?
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  They fly into the flag cloud to bomb the Germans,
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  because they knew that's where it was at.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  Good, bring it on.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  The more the merrier, baby.
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  I didn't sign up for this to be a coward.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  I didn't sign up for this for nothing.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  You authoritarians are all going to go to prison
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  and you've been caught.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  And the attack on the first amendment,
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  there's only a small part of it.
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  We're breaking it down second hour.
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  Tell your friends and family to tune in right now.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  Are we choosing our own destiny
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  or has it been pre-selected for us?
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.000]  As we've moved through history,
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  every great leader has had to understand
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  the potential of information.
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  From compulsory state education
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine,
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  we are kept in perpetual bondage
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  to the ideas that shape our actions.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  between you observing and testing it out
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.000]  and verifying it,
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  they can take total control of your awareness.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  All of this is happening so fast,
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  you need to be ahead of the game.
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.000]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  so that they would not only endorse but demand
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  a war.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  All of another one, another plane to take.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  State of mind.
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  Get your copy of State of Mind the Movie
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  at infowars.com
[58:44.000 --> 58:47.000]  and remember every order at infowarsstore.com
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  receives a free citizen rulebook.
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.000]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  And as a result,
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home
[59:02.000 --> 59:03.000]  in your garage.
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  How do you know which solution is the safest
[59:05.000 --> 59:06.000]  and most effective?
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  Supernatural silver is a new patented technology
[59:09.000 --> 59:13.000]  that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  This technology is so powerful,
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  it must be made in a laboratory.
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  of only 110 volts of DC current,
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  making supernatural silver
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  hundreds of times more effective against viruses,
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  bacteria and fungus.

[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  deep behind enemy lines,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  the information war continues.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  You know, I told myself
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  when I was driving into work today
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  that I was going to be calm
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  and go over the attack on the First Amendment,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  but I'll be honest with you,
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  I cannot,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  I cannot be calm
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  when everybody else is being calm
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  and criminals are engaging in open political persecution
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  just like we saw in Communist China,
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  Communist Russia,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Communist East Germany,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Fascist Germany,
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  Fidel Castro's Cuba,
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  the list goes on and on,
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  and I should hear washing classical tyranny unfold.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  I'm going to get to it in the next segment
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  and break it all down.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  This is kind of a no man's land segment.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  We're going to be getting rid of it soon
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  and just making the next segment longer.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  Going to a real standard radio clock,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  but the frustration is that
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  it's such a dumb down public,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  not even so much dumb down,
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  just conditioned to accept this,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  that they think it's weird
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  when you get upset some of them
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  about being run over.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  And I think that's because they're upset
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  with the American spirit,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  or just a basic spirit of liberty for that matter.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  I went tubing down in San Marcos this morning
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  with one of my friends and our children,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  and actually came up here about an hour before the show,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  they're actually up here today,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  and I jumped in,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  and my sunglasses fell off,
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  and there was a guy there with his kids with fins on
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  who was picking up sunglasses,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  and he went, come on kids, let's get them.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  Before they stir up the water,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  he was watching me like a predator,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  and it was him and his 10, 13-year-old daughters,
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  and they shot right by us,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  and I figured out my glasses were gone,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  and watched him about 50 yards away by then,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  putting sunglasses in a bag he had of sunglasses,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  because we were out there at 10 in the morning,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  so people go at 10 in the morning to find all the sunglasses,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  it's a business,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  and I was sure that he'd just gotten my sunglasses,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  because I remember he jumped in
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  and shot right past me when my glasses had fallen off,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  and I was going to get goggles,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  and he got my little $100 pair of Oakleys,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  I mean, not that big of a deal.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  It was interesting to watch him, though,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  like a river bird predator,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  because the animals are so accustomed to humans down there,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  they're not domesticated,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  they are acclimated that we're not a threat,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  that we saw a big red-tailed hawk,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  the closest I've ever seen one in the wild,
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  sitting on a branch of a tree going down the river,
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  looks like Brazil or something on the Great Rainforest,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  or going down the Amazon,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  and I saw a big blue heron right up close,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  like 10 feet away,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  closest I've ever been to a blue heron,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  I've tube down there many times,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  and he had his beak open,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  sitting there watching fish and creeping up and eating them,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  and that guy watching me,
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  waiting for all of us to jump in and lose our sunglasses,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  and then shooting off with his daughters,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  like a well-trained gypsy of old or something,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  to get my glasses,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  and then I could look at 50 yards and see him looking back,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  stick him in a bag full of other ones,
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  because it's carrying him by the current,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  he goes, hurry before he gets stirred up and shoots out to get him,
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  and then I'm like, oh, how to get my glasses?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  He's already gone,
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  and I didn't even get mad at the guy,
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  it was realizing,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  I'm somebody who goes down there maybe twice a year,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  he obviously lived down there,
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  gets sunglasses all day,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  that's the whole industry down there,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  with thousands of day going through it,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  wallets, jewelry, you name it,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  and he was like a blue heron, I was a fish,
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  but see, I am like a blue heron trying to teach fish
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  how to not be eaten, basically,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  and if people would just become aware,
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  at least I recognize that guy,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  about 90% sure he got my glasses,
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  in fact, I'm pretty much 100%,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  but I'll just say 90%,
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  I recognized, oh, that's why they're not here anymore,
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  in crystal clear water,
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  because he shot off as soon as he saw me come up without him,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  I wonder why he looked right at me and went,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  come on, girls, before they stir it up,
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  with a predatory look, swim right by me, stopped,
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  I'm going, oh, my glasses,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  I go get my goggles, come back, they're gone,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  and then see him putting them in his bag down there,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  and I didn't chase after him giving my glasses back,
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  I was like, thank you for that lesson, my friend,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  that was a very valuable lesson I learned today,
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  have floaties on your glasses.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  Get a one to two year supply of soaps
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  for all your cleaning needs.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  You're getting soap products twice as good
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  as what you're using now.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  This is an amazing deal,
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  and you will love the way real soap makes your skin feel.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  Call 1-800-340-7091,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  or visit www.5-star-soap.com.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  Alex and his staff have used these
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  earth-friendly pure soaps for years.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  See them on the web, www.5-star-soap.com,
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  In the councils of government,
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  we must guard against the acquisition
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  of unwarranted influence,
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  whether sought or unsought,
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  by the military industrial counterparts.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  In Dallas, Texas,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  three shots were fired at President Kennedy's
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  state in downtown Dallas.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  The first reports say that
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  by the shooting.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  It is a big idea,
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  a new order.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  It was almost as if we were
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  planned in force to hit Judd's pancake.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Either you were with us,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  or you were with the terrorists.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree with it.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers,
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  not in the hands of criminals.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  Guns will be taken.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  No one will be able to be off.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  For many of the police and guard troops,
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  it is an uncomfortable job to do this
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  in an American city.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  Global governance at last.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  Is it one world?
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  But are we all just living and dying
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  for what the central banks do?
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  And for me, give me liberty,
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  or give me death!
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  And we are now back into the second hour
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  in the second half of this hour.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  We are going to have in studio
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  Terry Holcomb in studio.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  He was arrested
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  for having a pistol open carry,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  including a black powder pistol.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  It's totally and completely legal and lawful.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  And we see folks carrying regular firearms,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  being arrested all over the U.S.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  in areas where it is not prohibited
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  by unconstitutional law.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  And this is a big national story
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  that Infowars Nightly News reporter
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  Jacari Jackson broke.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  And so I appreciate Jacari
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  scheduling these guys for the Sunday show.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  This has now become a national story,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  seeing a veteran in a wheelchair also
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  that's coming up in the next segment
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  who was arrested for his firearms.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  So that will be in the next segment.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Then we'll bring them in studio
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  with us here on air.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  Now, let's get back into the attack
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  on the First Amendment.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Lois Lerner, the head of the IRS,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  back in May of this year,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  she came and took the fifth,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  so she wouldn't have to testify,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  but then said that she wasn't targeting people
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  in the testimony.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  Well, the fifth doesn't let you commit perjury.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  It lets you, if you believe you're being set up
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  or whatever, or it's self-incrimination,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  it lets you take the fifth and shut up.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  And then they can't compel you to testify.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  That's all that means.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  The right to remain silent.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  Everybody thinks that's Miranda.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  Miranda was a case where the police
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  had to remind you,
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  the Supreme Court said,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  that you had the right to remain silent.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  But that's now been thrown out
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  because common law says,
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  ignorance, the law is no defense.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  So that shows the direction
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  our country's going,
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  even though you can technically say that is the law.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  So she now, her emails
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  have now been released.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  The investigation, they've now subpoenaed
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  her emails,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  where she calls the Tea Party
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  and any other libertarian or conservative group
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  very dangerous,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  and says that
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  they need to go after them.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  Okay, so
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  she's lying.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  The Attorney General lied. They all lied.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  Of course, they have audited
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  thousands of Tea Party groups
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  and zero socialist communist groups,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  authoritarian groups that they call liberal.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  The Attorney General goes to big socialist black churches
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  and tells them,
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  go ahead, be political. We're not going to go after you.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  Giving them a green light
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  to something that's already unconstitutional.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  You can't tell churches
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  what they can say and can't do. There's no federal jurisdiction.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  They trick churches to become
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  tax-exempt
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  foundations, tax-exempt
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  charities.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  But you're still tax-exempt of the First Amendment
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  and until the 50s, that was the case.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  I mean, this just shows
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  guaranteed, folks, if we don't
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  turn the NSA spying around,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  in 10 years people will say, the NSA has a right
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  to spy on you without warrants. That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  That's how
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  they set up this tyranny
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  and then just get everybody used to it. So there's the Wall
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  Street Journal. Here is the
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  Washington Times' email show.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  IRS lowest learner, specifically
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  targeted Tea Party. Boom.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  And even if she didn't
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  commit perjury, which she clearly did,
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  and all of her underlings as well
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  went on record and lied,
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  the persecution
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  of people
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  is the essence of tyranny.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  When the big bad government
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  politically targets people, we've always
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  known this has been happening for decades, but now
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  it's admitted
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  ladies and gentlemen, and if they don't
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  go to jail for this,
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  if they don't even get a slap on the wrist
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  of fine,
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  man, Katie, bar the door.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  So many people I
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  talk to go,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  man, I'm not going to be political. They'll come
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  shut me down. I have preachers
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  telling me that all the time, and I'm like, they're going to
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  shut you down because you're a coward.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  Everybody lays down,
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  you're going to get, I've told this story 50 times
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  I'll tell it again. In the last decade, they've noticed
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  suddenly that coyotes have begun to kill humans.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  Coyotes have never been recorded
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  to kill anybody other than a small child
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  or baby. They're now eating full
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  grown women, mainly.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  In Canada and the U.S., women usually
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  will be at a park by themselves at lunch
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  eating as usually the MO.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  A group of coyotes, 5 to 10 or more
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  will show up. The woman will fall on the ground
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  like a horror movie from Learned Helplessness.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  In real life, women fight back
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  folks. Not like Jason comes into the machete
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  and you fall down.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  I don't know what woman that is, or woman I've ever been around.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  And the whole point is
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  is that
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  a man might be able to subdue
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  a woman that ain't going to go too easy
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  to use French.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  And the woman falls down and they kill them.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  Women now fall down
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  to a mountain lion. They now fall down
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  to a coyote.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  Mountain lions have always attacked people
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  but more and more often areas where they know
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  that you're not scared of them.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  So the point is everybody grovels
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  to this chilling effect, to this
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  tyranny. The government is like coyotes now
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  getting away with
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  targeting us and attacking us. So free people
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  fight back for their basic liberties.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  Now,
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  this is only the tip of the iceberg. Let me get to
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  the
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  other stories here
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  that are just from the last few days.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  Senate panel
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  okay's measure defining a journalist
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  and the LA Times spun this
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  saying
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  oh, the government's going to protect the press.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  The press is already protected over the First Amendment
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  just like religion
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  and the right to assemble this. Read the whole
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  First Amendment folks.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  Religion, then the press, then the people
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  the right to assemble and to petition the
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  government for redress of grievance. Go
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  read the whole thing. It's only two lines long.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  So Diane Feinstein comes out
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  last year and says, I know how we're going to shut down
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  talk radio. I know how we're going to shut down
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  bloggers. I mean, they had a whole bunch of senators
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  say we want to shut them down.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  They're evil. They're liars. They're racist.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  You know, Harry Reid has said this. I'm going to play this
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  clip coming up. Harry Reid said the Tea Party
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  is, you know, dangerous and bad
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  and it's un-American and I love the government.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  The government is good.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  Remember, Obama said, we don't want to hear about
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  tyranny right around the corner.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Well,
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  now they're coming out going, oh,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  like the Patriot Act. Texture rights.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Oh,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  we have a Journalism Protection Act
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  where the federal government will list if you're a
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  journalist or not and then
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  not let you have authorization to any type of
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  documents, information, press conferences,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  but it's worse than that.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  You will not be able to
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  protect your sources
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  unless the government
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  certifies
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  and they liken it to CNN of the New York
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  Times. They will decide.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  They said the drugs report are
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  info wars. We will not be
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  journalistic even though we're real journalists.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  World Net Daily getting a secret army document
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  where they know Al Qaeda launched a chemical
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  attacks. That takes a lot of nerve
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  when they're arresting whistleblowers to put that out,
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  because
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  that's a big story. It should be a national
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  news story right there.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  So this is what we're talking about here
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  and then they spin it to the sheep. Oh,
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  we're going to protect because Obama's
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  been persecuting whistleblowers and going
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  after media sources
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  and all the rest of it.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  And so the way
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  they spin that is, oh, don't worry,
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  the Democrats, the most authoritarian
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  in history against the press, arresting
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  reporters, you name it, we're going
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  after sources. We're going to protect it
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  by stripping everybody of First Amendment
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  protection unless you're a toady
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  and then we give it to you. Kind of like a White House
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  press briefing where you've got to kiss
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  their butt properly or you get kicked
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  out. Ask a hard question. Does it matter
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  if you work for the New York Times? You'll never
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  be in a press briefing again.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  This is their reign of terror.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  So Matt Drudge, Blast
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  Diane Feinstein, we're trying to define who
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  is and isn't a real
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  reporter and calls her a fascist
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  and I could not agree.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Oh, here's the L.A. Times, though.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  Bill to protect journalists, clear Senate
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  panel. What do you want to bet they're
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  going to get called journalists? Because they lied
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  to you and told you this was something to
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  protect the First Amendment instead of
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  gutting it. But here's the good news, people
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  are waking up to the lies. When we come
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  back, law-abiding gun owners
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  having their guns taken.

[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  Hello, this is Hank Hill
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  and I'm telling you what, you need to

[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Broadcasting Worldwide

[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  Yep, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Alright, I'm going to shift into the second
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  amendment that's under attack here in a moment.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  But first off,
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  look at what happened in other
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  authoritarian countries. When the state
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  starts persecuting you,
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  your political views, you know you're
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  in a tyranny.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  And when they start persecuting the
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  founding ideas of a nation,
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  you know it's a group of revolutionaries
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  trying to overthrow the system. And that's
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  what the globalists are. They're the
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  revolutionaries like
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  the communists, the Bolsheviks in
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  1917 in Russia.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  We are the counter-revolutionaries
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  and the weathermen and Obama's people
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  that's why they're doing all this
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  persecution. That's why they're
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  engaged in all this political
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  correctness. Trying to say everybody's
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  a racist if you don't want to turn in your
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  guns. Is because this is
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  a takeover by a political class.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  And they are going after
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  the First Amendment. They are going after
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  talk radio. They are going after free
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  speech. They are going after the media
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  and we either stick together or
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  hang separate as Benjamin Franklin said.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  And the reason they're coming after us
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  is I have 3 million listeners
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  a day, conservatively. And that's not
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  exaggerated numbers like a lot of shows.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  We have millions of
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  visitors a day at infowars.com.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  Other patriot type sites
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  get tens of millions of visitors a day
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  like Drudge and others.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  Together we are bigger than the
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  old dinosaur media. We are the media.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  And they know that.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  And they want to shut us down
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  calling it liberal but it's really
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  authoritarianism. That's why you need to
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  stand with us for the First Amendment
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  or lose everything. That's why it's
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  imperative you spread the word
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  about infowars.com. That's why it's
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  imperative you spread the word about
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  prismplanet.com. Why you become a
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  subscriber to see the films and the
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  nightly news and so much more at
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  prismplanet.tv. An operation
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  awaking the sleeping giant. That's why
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  it's imperative you buy the books and the
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  videos and the t-shirts. Because unlike
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  MPR that gets taxpayer money
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  you didn't know that stimulus money.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  We get none of that. We are supported
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  by your free will.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  And that's why they want to collectivize things
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  that make us all poor under clout and
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  piven. So you have no extra money
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  to politically or
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  economically vote with your
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  dollars. So get at cost
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  the new info wars
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  September issue. Thou shalt not have
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  any gods above the state.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  It's a special issue about the
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  authoritarianism of
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  people calling themselves liberals.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  And when the fake right wing does stuff
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  we go after them. You know that folks.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  But I've never seen such a full court
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  press. Now is the time
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  to get involved. Infowarsstore.com

[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  and you are funding
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  really the number one
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  multimedia platform to fight tyranny
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  and promote what they call terrorism
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  basic Americana.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  Now that said let me get
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  into Harry Reid before I get into the second
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  amendment. Harry Reid I played
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  this Friday. I've got to play it again.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  Remember Obama said don't listen to those that say
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  there's always tyranny around the corner.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  No it already ran us over like a bus
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  and it's back and back over us right now.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  He says
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  government is good inherently.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  Now look at government
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  in the last century. It killed over
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  100 million people
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  in Russia
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  and Eastern Europe and other areas
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  of Europe alone. 60 million in Russia
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  by itself. Upwards of 80 million
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  in communist China. 260
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  plus million worldwide
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  in the 20th century University of Hawaii
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  study that came out a decade
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  ago. Look up demo side or death by
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  government. Non-military deaths
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  killed by government.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  They've got the
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  motorhead song killed by death.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  How about killed by government?
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  And
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  they've got a University of Chicago
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  study on it as well. Their numbers
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  are even higher.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  He's saying government is good and those
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  that are against it are anarchist.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  The globalists are anarchist against the
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  Bill of Rights and Constitution and individualism.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  The state says it'll go
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  run wild. They are
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  kleptocratic selective
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  anarchist who are above the law. Look at the
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  UN. A diplomatic community.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  Here is this
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  quick comment by Harry Reid.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  And I would also talk
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  about my friend from
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  Oklahoma. This is Senate floor. I know
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  that he's smart
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  and he
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  and I understand that. But
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  Madam President, just because you're smart doesn't mean
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  you're always right. But kissing is all they do
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  in the Senate. We have
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  a situation where this
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  country has been driven by the Tea Party
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  for the last number of years.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  When I was in school I studied
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  government
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  and I learned about the
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  anarchists.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  Now they were different
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  than the Tea Party
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  because they were violent.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  But they were anarchist
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  because they did not believe in government
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  at any level and they acknowledged it.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  The Tea Party kind of hides that.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  We don't have anything.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  We don't have anything against government.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  That's what it all amounts to.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  They're not doing
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  physically destructive things to
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  buildings and people.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  But they are doing everything they can
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  to throw a monkey wrench into any form
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  of government. Whether it's
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  local, whether
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  it's state or federal government,
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  that's what it's all about.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  And so anything they can do
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  to throw a monkey wrench
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  in the wheels of government, they're happy
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  with government.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  And I'm sorry to say my friend Volcoma
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  is helping them.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  Maybe not directly, but indirectly.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  And that's wrong.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  Government is
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  not inherently bad.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  Government is inherently good.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  That's why we have a constitution.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  That's what we direct.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  That's good. Now let's just be clear.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  Government historically has been inherently bad.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  Big government especially.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  And they're at odds with the bill
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  with Volcoma across the board.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  Whether it's Pulitzer Prize winner
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  Chris Hedges who's a real liberal
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  saying he's twice as bad as Bush
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  to the Constitution. Or whether you're
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  Pat Buchanan, a real right winger.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  I mean anybody with half a brain cell
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  knows that
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  the Democratic Party is power grabbing
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  with the help of the Republican leadership
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  like nothing we've ever seen.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  And now
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  they've got federal task forces out there
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  without judge or jury taking veterans
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  guns. If they find something in their psychology
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  file, they don't like.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  When we come back we're going to get
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  in studio to guest
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  who are from an amazing organization
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  from a real civil rights
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  organization.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  And that is of course
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  TexansFarmsFreedom.com
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  legislative director for that
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  and we're also going to have
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  Terry Holcomb on
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  who is a pastor
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  and a board member of Texas Open Carry
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  who was arrested
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  Friday. Jakari Jackson, M4W
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  News Reporter, video
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  taped it. And then he went
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  back Friday. There was more civil rights action.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  They arrested a disabled veteran
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  in a wheelchair for his firearm
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  downtown. And the police say
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  we don't care if it's legal or lawful.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  If somebody doesn't like how it looks
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  their right to not be scared by your gun
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  and your holster
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  is all right to take it. Now that's normally the case
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  when they take guns. This time
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  it deals
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  with going on the Capitol grounds where the law says
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  you can take black powder
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  onto
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  the grounds. They show them the law
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  they don't care they still arrest them.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  That is going to be coming up. We're going to premiere
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  some new video here. Friday night
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  we already had the video of Mr. Holcomb
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  being arrested. There's new video that just went up
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  on infowars.com
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  that is dealing with the disabled
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  veteran in the wheelchair.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  So this is the type of stuff going on. This is the
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  real civil rights movement folks.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  They want to solve each other's throat in MSNBC
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  Hypes Racial Division in the name of Unity All Day.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  How about all of us having
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  our basic liberties restored? Private
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  property, the family, the right to self-defense
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  that's what we defend as
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  patriots. That's why they call us terrorists.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  The world
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  is discovering the power of medicinal silver
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  to fight against life threatening
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  pathogens. And as a result
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  dozens of silver solutions
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  have emerged. You can even make your own
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  How do you know which solution is the
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  safest and most effective?
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  Supernatural silver is a new patented
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  technology that is made using
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  This technology is so powerful
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  Colloidal and ionic silvers
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  use a charge of only 110 volts
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  of DC current. Making
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  supernatural silver hundreds of times
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  more effective against viruses, bacteria
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  and fungus.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  internally. And our silver gel
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  can be used topically. To find out

[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  Now I just grabbed
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  one of my riders on the
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  phone during the break and asked him to
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  repost it to the top of infowars.com
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  and prisonplanet.com
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  as a red link.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  So it'll be up there in the next 10 minutes
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  for the radio audience.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  It's since Friday gone into the archive
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  but there's new video that just got
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  posted minutes ago
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  of a veteran in Austin being arrested
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  for having a firearm legally
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  and lawfully. That just went up today
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  because it's from yesterday. We have crew
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  up here today so upset by it
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  who shot it that they just uploaded it
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  like 20-30 minutes ago.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  That's going up on infowars.com
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  and prisonplanet.com
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  in the same article
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  and we can put that article up on screen
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  for folks so I can give
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  them the
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  headline out there so that radio listeners
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  can just search engine it for now and find it.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  Shock video, Texas
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  state troopers arrest legally armed
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  American
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  and now we can say Americans
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  because we're going to add the new video
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  and all over America this is
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  the
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  new civil rights movement.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  They want us to fight with each other
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  and say the new civil rights movement
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  is to teach your 5-year-old
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  how to have sex. No, that's a way to corrupt them.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  No, the basic civil rights
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  is the Bill of Rights, the Constitution
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  based on biblical rights, based on
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  common law, thousands of years old
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  and joining us is Terry Holcomb.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  He's a pastor and board member of Texas Hope
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  and Carry who went on a walk
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  through Huntsville carrying his bushmaster
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  in an effort to raise public awareness
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  and now
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  I saw on the video was arrested
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  for carrying one in downtown
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Austin on the Capitol
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  Grounds and then Rachel Malone
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  is a firearms freedom activist and
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  is a legislative director of Texas
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  firearmsfreedom.com
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  a group dedicated to the preservation
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  and protection of Second Amendment rights and I appreciate
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  your amazing stand, your courage
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  people are doing this everywhere.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  One thing they do is the Attorney General said
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  they brainwashed the public against guns
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  that's why they have TV ads and show billboards
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  showing revolvers and shotguns
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  saying report illegal guns
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  so I had a carpet cleaner guy
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  try to call the cops on me because of a gun case
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  they literally believed that
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  that guns were illegal. This is part of the fraud
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  you guys are breaking that fraud
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  with the truth but
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  the police
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  don't care
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  at least in many areas, in many areas they are
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  patriotic and aware. So Terry
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  and Rachel, thanks for coming on
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  and joining us. Tell us what happened
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  to you Friday and what's been ongoing.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  There's a lot that hasn't
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  everybody's seen the arrest
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  but they didn't see what happened
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  prior to the arrest.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  We had actually started out
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  setting up a meeting with the State Preservation Board
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  John Snead,
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  Commander Ortiz of
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  Department Public Safety Capital Police
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  the major of
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  DPS and the Sergeant of Arms
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  the House and the Senate
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  setting up a meeting setting up this event
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  trying to work with law enforcement
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  working with the State Preservation Board
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  trying to... So this was even
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  officially set up. That is correct.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  Wow and they still, whoa.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  Yes sir. Now this is news, break all this down.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  Yes sir it is and we haven't exactly
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  communicated this so this is breaking news
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  really. We'd initially
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  wanted to go into the Capitol
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  and our original agreement
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  that we were able to forge was
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  to enter the Capitol without ammo.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  We would carry our long guns in and we agreed
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  to go in without any ammo.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  They had agreed to that initially
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  about two days before we were
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  set to meet with them in Austin
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  on last Monday
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  Department of Public Safety
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  decided that they no longer wanted
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  to allow us to enter open carrying
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  long guns.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  So okay we had
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  agreed to disagree. Because you're an evil
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  citizen slave. I mean
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  now Kim Jong-un in North Korea that's safe
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  to have guns. I understood. Hitler with guns but not
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  a citizen. It gets better.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  By the way as you know until the 50s
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  people should take guns into court but go ahead. That's correct.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  And you are allowed to conceal
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  carrying Austin too. So
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  at the Capitol. So we
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  agreed that we wouldn't go inside the building.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  We were extending professional courtesies
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  to the State Preservation Board and DPS
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  and so we agreed just to go have a peaceful
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  appreciation. We wanted to
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  you know thank... Be thankful for that.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  They have all those statues of Davey Crockett
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  and people with their guns. Absolutely.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Well those must be cut down immediately.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  Absolutely. And
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  so when I get there and I have
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  two individual, two fellow board members
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  with me on Friday morning. By the way
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  because this got spun that you guys were going looking for trouble.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  That's the classic spin. She was wearing a short skirt.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  She deserved to be raped. But
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  now we learn it was on official
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  deal you were trying to do to submit the
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  Second Amendment. Because the media I saw
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  are spinning oh they set up
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  cops who didn't know the law that arrested you.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  They absolutely knew we were coming.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  In all fairness
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  I didn't tell them I was going to be carrying a black powder
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  pistol but that's a relevant issue. I got arrested
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  for carrying a black powder pistol.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  Not a long rifle. So
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  we get there about 10 30 in the morning
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  and
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  we park
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  in a parking garage and I don't get one block
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  and three DPS officers
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  stopped me. That's the first encounter.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  The officer wanted to know why I had the black powder
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  pistol didn't say anything to the
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  AR-15 standing on my right and my left.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  And again it's a slave with a gun.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  That image is like
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  a high noon to a vampire. Absolutely.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  I told him I was carrying the weapon
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  for self-protection just like he was. And he
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  said you're not allowed to carry it like that. I handed him
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  the Texas Penal Code 4601
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  that exempts
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  black powder
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  pistols that were made before 1899
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  or replicas of black powder pistols
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  that were made before 1899. I had an
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  1858 Remington.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  And the video is up on the
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  site. You show him all this. Absolutely.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  And I hand him the Texas Penal Code.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  He reads it. He says okay
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  you give him the yours. Let me go get mine.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  So he goes and gets it.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  And he comes back and he says this.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  He says okay we've established this legal for you
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  to carry it. It's on video. He's holding both
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  things up. Read him. Yes sir.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  And he says we've established this legal to carry it.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  He said but let me say this. I'm alarmed.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  Well I'm alarmed
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  by them with guns and us not having them.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Absolutely. So the idea is because he's alarmed
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  what can he have your house next
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  because he's alarmed? Can he have your bank account
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  because he's alarmed? We need to get everybody off
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  the road because every time I get on the road I'm alarmed.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  Exactly.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  At this point I saw it was going to go into
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  a bad direction. I'm alarmed going to Chicago
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  because they don't have any guns and the crime rates.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  What, ten times Austin's? Absolutely.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  I asked him at that point about being
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  detained. And he said yes you're
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  being detained. Wow.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  Absolutely. What a tyrant man.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  Absolutely. And we had done nothing wrong.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  We had walked 200 feet
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  from the car.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  So you weren't even
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  fully on the Capitol grounds yet were you?
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  Absolutely not. So it's doubly illegal because
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  you could have had a regular firearm there.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  Wow.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  Wow. Now when he says he's alarmed
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  by my revolver
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  1858
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  ball and cap revolver again
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  I've got two AR-15s on my right and my left
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  that they never talked to. Fully loaded.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  And
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  they never talked to those guys. It was just me.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  Anyway
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  he eventually let me go with a warning that I was
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  going to be arrested if anyone was alarmed.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  And we
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  walked a- Wow. We walked to a-
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  Lay out of the free home of the brave boy I tell ya.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  Absolutely. And we were out numbered five to one.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  At the Capitol.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  But they're alarmed. They had
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  set this up to have extra
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  force and they were prepared to arrest
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  us the moment we got there.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  And so we walked another few blocks.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  We were trying to get to the south side of the Capitol
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  because one of our
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  fellow members had already been arrested and I
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  got the call that they had been arrested.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  The media was over there and they needed me to get over there.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  So we were walking. Two more troopers
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  intervened me just before we got to the south
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  side. I walked by them and kept
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  going and they stopped me and brought me back
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  and they said you know.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  By the way that's all illegal. They have no reason
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  to stop you. Absolutely. And they're there.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  It's official oppression.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  False imprisonment. This is true official oppression.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  Yes. They absolutely
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  knew that I was doing was legal or they would
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  have arrested me and disarmed me from the word gun.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  Oh you absolutely have them. The problem is they don't care
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  it's just more taxpayer money. They'll just write
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  moral ladies tickets for the
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  lawsuit you win. Absolutely. So you got to get them
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  fired. So they stopped us.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  Warned us again. Asked me to put my
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  revolver in my car.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  I wasn't having a long discussion. I said
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  I appreciate you sharing your opinion with me.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  I'm going to move on now. So we walked
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  another 50 yards
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  in a bicycle
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  state trooper who I saw talking to the
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  two DPS officers that had just
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  talked to me came and stopped me immediately
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  again. So I guess he said if you want
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  to arrest him for no reason I will. Well
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  I take my glasses off because
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  I'm a very cooperative person.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  I'm not going to give you up my right but I'll have
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  a conversation with you.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  At this point I'm not wanting to have any more conversations.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  I put my sunglasses off and I said if I
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  come across as you disrespectful don't
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  take it personal. I'm done being harassed.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  I'm not cooperating anymore.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  I said I saw you talk to those two DPS
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  officers just 50 yards behind us
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  and now here you are again. What do you want?
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  He said well you can I have your name?
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  And I said I know
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  that you just talked to those guys.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  So you've got my name. Well I need you to give it to me.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  Stay there. Stay there.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  You're getting soap
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  products twice as good as what you're using now.

[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  The world is discovering the power
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  of medicinal silver to fight against
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  life threatening pathogens.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  have emerged. You can even make
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  your own colloidal silver at home
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  in your garage. How do you know which
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  solution is the safest and most effective?
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  Supernatural silver is a new patented
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  technology that is made using
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  This technology is so powerful
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  a charge of only 110 volts
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  of DC current, making supernatural
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  silver hundreds of times
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  more effective against viruses, bacteria
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  and fungus.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  internally and our silver gel

[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  our own destiny or has it been pre-selected
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  for us? As we've moved through
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  history, every great leader has had to
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  understand the potential of
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  information. Billions of dollars
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  have been spent privately
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  and publicly looking at
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  how to tap into your psyche.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  From compulsory state education
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  to the Hollywood media
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  brainwashing machine, we are kept
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  in perpetual bondage to the ideas
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  that shape our actions. When somebody
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  obscures that feedback loop between
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  you observing and testing it out
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  and verifying it, they can take total control
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  of your awareness. All of this is happening so fast
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  How to engineer the opinion
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  of the American people so that they would
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  not only endorse but demand
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  a war.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  Out of another one, another plane to take.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  Out of mind, because there's a war on.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  For your mind, get your copy
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  of State of Mind the Movie

[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  rulebook.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  Coast to coast,
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  World Wide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  If you go
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000]  up to infowars.com
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  you can see the video that's been up since
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  Friday that's become national news.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  And then another video we just uploaded
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  of a veteran in a wheelchair
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  being arrested
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  down outside the Texas Capitol
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  of the United States
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  outside the Texas Capitol
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  for daring to have a firearm.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  Only the state can have guns.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  Only the state without a warrant can stick
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  their hands down your wife's pants at the airport
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  to see if they're with Al Qaeda.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  Even while government runs Al Qaeda in Syria.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  Terry Holcomb, who got arrested
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  at Rachel Malone Legislative Aid.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  They're really getting scared of the First Amendment.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  They know that we're
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  showing people that it's not illegal,
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  it's not dirty, it's not bad.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  I want you, Terry, to finish up
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  the rest that took place that's on video
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  that radio listeners can see on the site.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  But then I want to get Rachel's take on all this as well
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  and find out where you guys are going.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  And then I want to get you on for
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  an extended hour long special report
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  sometime this week coming up on
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  To sum it up quickly, basically because
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  I wouldn't submit to their scare tactics
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  and that's absolutely what they were.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  They were trying to scare me into submitting
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  to getting up my right.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  Well, it's racketeering.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  If somebody makes somebody do something like,
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  hey, that's a nice watch on the train
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  with a bunch of guys, that's racketeering.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  And this is the important part.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  They were ordered to arrest me.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  I was specifically targeted.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  They were ordered to arrest me.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  It wasn't because I broke a law.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  They wanted me.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  Why wasn't it the guys with the AR-15s?
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  Why did they arrest the disabled veteran?
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  Is it like something about veterans
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  that makes them mad?
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  No, what makes them mad is
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  they're not the only ones that can have guns.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  And they can't tell us we can't have them.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  And if they're going to try and
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  legislate us out of it like they did,
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  which way you all talk about in a minute,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  we're going to go and we're going to protest it.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  So they're scared of America?
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  100%. They do not want us having guns.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  So like a child is afraid of like
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  goblins and vampires. They're afraid
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  of John Wayne and George Washington.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  According to the arresting officer,
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  he said he was alarmed by my
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  cap and ball revolver
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  weights and 223s and 556s
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  fully loaded mags everywhere.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  40 calibers, 9mm,
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  45s everywhere around.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  And he was alarmed by my black powder pistol.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  And then they admit they know the law.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  They don't care. So they put you in the police car.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  What happened once they took you to jail?
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  They booked me.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  And the sergeant there
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  insisted on making sure that
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  the arresting officer put on the report.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  Be sure to state that you were alarmed.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  They probably were alarmed.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  They probably were alarmed.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  So if I'm alarmed by an illegal checkpoint,
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  what am I supposed to do? Absolutely.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  I guess 1775
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  Lexington, Concord. I mean, I guess that's what
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  they're looking for. I talked to my attorney
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  today and right now I can't open
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  carry my black powder revolver.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  My rights effectively been taken away from me.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  So they've totally violated your
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  God-given rights, your civil rights, everything else?
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  Absolutely. First, second, fourth.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  Well, they spy on us without warrants.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  They run al-Qaeda. I mean, they do whatever they want.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  Well, by now.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  I'm sure NSA has got me pegged pretty quick.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  Well, yeah, but they're all committing crimes.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  So racials, legislative aid.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  All over the country, they're freaked out by folks marching
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  with guns because the sheep see that.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  I mean, I got a buddy had them call them
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  because they saw a gun rack. The realtor saw it
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  and called the cops.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  People think guns are illegal.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  And you terrorized her
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  showing folks they're not. How dare you?
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  That's right. Well, see, the way I see it, Terry's arrest
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  did not come out of a vacuum.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  This has been a major issue.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  It brought it to the forefront to bring it to attention again,
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  which is we need to keep this at the forefront.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  But here's what happened this past session.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  There were a lot of gun laws,
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  gun bills that were filed
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  in the legislature that would have
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  significantly enhanced Texas firearms freedom.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  A lot of listeners may not realize
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  Texas is this great bastion of gun freedom, right?
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  No, we're not wrong.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  Are we like 10th or something?
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  Possibly. I don't think we're...
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  We're only one of five that don't have open-curly rights.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  There are only a few other...
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  On average, I've seen statistics that we're like...
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  There's like nine states with better laws than us.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  It depends on exactly how you evaluate it,
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  because there are a lot of different laws to look at.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  But Texas is one of only about six or seven states
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  that does not even allow any open carry
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  of handguns.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  It does not qualify a black powder pistol as a handgun,
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  so it's free.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  Yeah, and they're openly planning to make us a red state.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  They've said that. We're going to salute Mao when they're done.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  There you go. So we have all these gun bills, right?
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  They were filed. There was great public support.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  They were going along nicely until they hit the picket fence.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  Representative Joe Pickett of El Paso
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  was appointed by Joe Strauss
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  as a committee chairman.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  And he had a committee that would have voted
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  those a lot of those bills out of his committee.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  So Pickett is an enemy of America.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  Absolutely. He's the first one.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  He's the first wall. He refused to let these bills come up
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  for a vote in committee,
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  just to vote on...
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  So Pickett of El Paso is King George III.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  He's also a puppet.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  Right. So he was appointed by Joe Strauss.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  Great. So who's a
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  speaker of the House?
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  I'm sure those bills were sent there on purpose today.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  So Joe Strauss
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  is also largely responsible for this.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  David Dewhurst, who tries to hold himself
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  as this great Liberty supporter of gun rights.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  Oh, he's an absolute tyrant.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  That's the truth. And he's also
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  largely responsible for a lot of...
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  Well, I hope he loves killing the TSA bill and all this.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  That's why he's not going to be governor.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  That's why he is not going to be senator.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  And when we're done with him, he's going to be nowhere.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  He is a piece of filth.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  So then we have Pickett, we have Strauss,
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  we have Dewhurst. What about Perry?
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  Perry could have acted. He put himself
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  forward. Well, he's blackmailed.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  Right. So he refused to call a special session
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  which was his right and his
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  responsibility really is good. But he wears a cowboy hat
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  and waves guns around on TV. Right. So he's the biggest
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  gun rights supporter. By the way, why is he always
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  in public waving handguns around?
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  So that he can ignore the citizens
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  being violated. But technically
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  they're saying don't open carry a handgun.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  Because it could be alarming, but of course
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  it's not alarming.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  And this sounds like total tyranny.
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  I mean Texans ought to be ashamed to have this going on.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  So we have our highest ranking law
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  enforcement official in the state of Texas,
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  Attorney General Greg Abbott. He's a wonderful
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  gun rights supporter, right? So what's he doing
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  about all of this? Nothing. His office
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  has blatantly refused it.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  So they've told him you'll get federal office
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  if you sell Texas out
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  and turn it into a globalist operation.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  And we have communicated what's going on.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  This isn't an isolated issue. It's just
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  this is the one that finally
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  set the dynamite. Oh no, they hate you guys
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  because you're effective. I'm always reading about
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  Texans for firearms, freedom, and the Texas Rifle
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  Association and all the great folks.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  They just hate your guts because you're trying to keep
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  this state free and how dare you. Absolutely.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  And so Greg Abbott is aware
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  specifically of all the arrests happening
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  in under 4201-88, which is
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  the disorderly conduct.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  Well, you know what the answer is. I mean,
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  you guys should organize like a thousand people
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  with black powder revolvers
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  to show up. Let's do it. It's coming.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  San Antonio, October the 19th
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  because San Antonio is taking the same
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  stance as Austin DPS
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  and the Capitol folks. We have
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  an event scheduled for October the 19th
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  at the Alamo. Well, how about we're alarmed
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  by them? I mean, I'm alarmed by SWAT teams
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  in black mask and helicopters
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  and all this stuff. I'm highly alarmed.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  I was alarmed yesterday. I'm highly alarmed by
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  this official oppression, by the tiering, by the
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  liberty being taken away from the people. You guys
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  sound like people that started the country.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  I don't know if I can even talk to a scum like you.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  Well, here's a message. We're not going away.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  I'm coming back.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  Well, you know the answer.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  It's civil rights lawsuits. It's all of it.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  And they're going to lose.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  I mean, I've looked at the case. They're going to lose.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  That's not all they're going to lose.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  We are going after the legislators.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  We're not going to stand in anymore.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  We're not going to say, okay, your second amendment,
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  no. You're either constitutionalist
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  or you need to get out of office.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  There's too many people out there pandering.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  That's right. We've been losing the second amendment
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  because we only try to hold the line.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  Offense. We have to win the whole deal now.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  Win it all back now or it's all over.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  And you heard Harry Reid. They're scared of the real
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  Tea Party. They are. They're scared.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  Because we're taking America back just like I told
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  Peters Morgan. You try to take our guns
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  in 1776 again. It's over.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  We're done. We're not backing off.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  Line in the sand just like the Alamo. It's over.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  And that is our motto
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  for October 19th.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  But Texas has to be the final battle
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  place. It has to be.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  We're the only thing that's truly going to be able
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  to stand between us and the federal government.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  We're it.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  On April 19th, 1775 on the Lexington Green
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  the Red Cubs, the British Regulars
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  marched up and they yelled at the 80 people
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  who were standing there. Turn your guns in.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  Lay them down. Lay down your arms.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  You damn rebels lay down your arms and disperse.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  And what do they do? They chose to remain peaceful
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  and peacefully dispersed. But Captain
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  Parker told them, keep your arms.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  And he said, and if they shoot first,
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  then if it's a war they want, it's a war they'll get.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  Yes. And that's where it's headed in
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  this country. The federal government
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  is out of control and honestly
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  Texas puts on a good
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  bit of makeup to make it look
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  like it's conservative
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  and that it's constant. It's like a new coat of
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  paint behind the wood. It's termites. Absolutely.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  It's termites everywhere.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  And our state level government
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  is infiltrated with plenty of
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  Republican in name only. And it's starting to look
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  like, you know, Greg Abbott could be one of those.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  And he's running for governor.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  We know that Perry showed his true colors
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  when he didn't stand up for the people in what's right.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  You have the biggest battle ever
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  in how many years for the right
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  of people to bear arms. Well, there it is. We're going to be covering it.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  Get your guns and head to San Antonio
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  October, 19,
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  2013, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  at the Alamo Plaza.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  Oh, I gotta go down there for that.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  Man, I tell you, it is good
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  to know folks like you and
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  these tyrants want to keep pushing it.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  Who knows what will happen? I, you know, I pray
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  for peace, but I prepare for war.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  And I certainly hope that
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  that the tyrants running the system realize
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  we've been pushed around enough.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  And I could just say
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  authoritatively, I salute
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  your stand on the law.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  You were following the law and you were arrested.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  The videos are up on info wars dot com
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  red link. We had them reposted shock video.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Texas state troopers openly defy
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  law to kill second amendment
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  and it's got the veteran being arrested,
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  you being arrested, the guy on the wheelchair.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  People need to go check
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  this out. They need to get this out and fight
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  with the first amendment to avert
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  a new 1776.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  Absolutely, because that is where we're headed.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  The videos are up on info wars dot com.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  Great job to the crew.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  Great job, you guys coming in. I want continual
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  coverage on info wars, not only news
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  and the radio show this week with you
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  in depth on this subject.
