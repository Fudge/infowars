[02:22.760 --> 02:30.220]  amendment HR 2401 but the no-fly no buy act doesn't just deal with the second
[02:30.220 --> 02:34.680]  amendment it sets the precedent that if you're on a no-fly list which they
[02:34.680 --> 02:38.680]  admittedly are expanding worldwide and that it's going to be if you haven't paid
[02:38.680 --> 02:41.960]  your taxes or have bad credit in fact they admit that gets you on the no-fly
[02:41.960 --> 02:45.680]  list by the way is a bad credit that's been admitted that's one of the factors
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.040]  they quote have computers that create an algorithm of your risk no judge no jury
[02:50.040 --> 02:54.960]  no indictment no one you can face no accuser you can face this is the heart
[02:54.960 --> 03:00.440]  the core of tearing and the White House even staff swore he would do this they
[03:00.440 --> 03:05.760]  have three bills that do this two bills that that that had language that would
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.480]  allow it this bill complicitly states it there's no more denying and Fox News
[03:10.480 --> 03:15.160]  comes out and says oh some conservatives don't like it like it's not just all
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.320]  conservatives or liberals that don't like it no it's a few conservatives and
[03:19.320 --> 03:25.960]  they're saying the bill might be used against our second amendment I mean it
[03:25.960 --> 03:31.880]  completely bypasses due process Bill of Rights Constitution Magna Carta common law
[03:31.880 --> 03:39.400]  I mean it is the law of tyrants so of course it threatens it I mean what is
[03:39.400 --> 03:42.840]  from annual say if you're on that no-fly list over a million 100,000

[04:25.520 --> 04:31.600]  announced within hours of the Bilderberg group breaking up what did Tucker say
[04:31.600 --> 04:36.200]  inside sources said they decided to go ahead and hammer the dollar so we got
[04:36.200 --> 04:44.240]  that Cy Hersh is reporting what we already knew that the CIA killed Benazar
[04:44.240 --> 04:49.920]  Budo because she was exposing the fact that bin Laden was basically a CIA asset
[04:49.920 --> 04:54.320]  I mean I knew they killed her that when they machine gun her on television and
[04:54.320 --> 04:58.200]  said she died of hitting her head I mean they machine gun you on TV and then say

[06:23.440 --> 06:27.800]  have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[06:27.800 --> 06:33.000]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.520]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[07:16.760 --> 07:20.920]  not as wage slaves for someone else or even worse for large companies with no
[07:20.920 --> 07:24.520]  heart and soul nor loyalty to their employees if you were tired of being

[08:19.920 --> 08:27.320]  phones today at 1-800-259-9231 I want to hear what you have to say about three
[08:27.320 --> 08:33.600]  separate bills introduced the newest openly states the government without any
[08:33.600 --> 08:40.440]  proof any evidence no court of law no indictment no notice nothing they just
[08:40.440 --> 08:44.920]  put you on list saying you can own firearms not even a misdemeanor and
[08:44.920 --> 08:51.800]  then Fox News the conservative outfit and that's in quotes do it takes the part
[08:51.800 --> 08:56.040]  of the defender now the article saying oh maybe a few conservatives don't like
[08:56.040 --> 09:00.560]  this and think maybe it might affect their second amendment might affect the
[09:00.560 --> 09:06.040]  second amendment how about absolutely attacks the second amendment and the
[09:06.040 --> 09:10.720]  entire Bill of Rights and Constitution bringing in not just guilty until proven
[09:10.720 --> 09:14.440]  innocent forget innocent until proven guilty now it's guilty until proven
[09:14.440 --> 09:18.200]  innocent they're trying to move that further on the road to we just secretly
[09:18.200 --> 09:25.200]  arrest you secretly detain you secretly puts you on list do whatever we want
[09:25.200 --> 09:32.280]  I mean this is hard core tyranny it is liberty and freedom that protects all of
[09:32.280 --> 09:40.440]  us and it's a very thin veneer and after it's torn away it is absolute
[09:40.440 --> 09:50.120]  barbarism enslavement neo-surfdom feudalist fascist system now this just
[09:50.120 --> 09:59.240]  came in literally minutes ago when I was on break the major Indian newspapers
[09:59.240 --> 10:04.080]  British newspapers and others were reporting last night US journalist
[10:04.080 --> 10:10.760]  claims Budo was killed on Cheney's orders a special death squad assassinated
[10:10.760 --> 10:16.080]  Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Budo on the orders of former US vice
[10:16.080 --> 10:21.800]  president Dick Cheney and Arab TV channel has reported now it's confirmed they
[10:21.800 --> 10:25.800]  have these death squads the special combat applications group but that's
[10:25.800 --> 10:29.840]  been going on since Jimmy Carter said kind of the Psyhurst when he reported
[10:29.840 --> 10:33.320]  that we did a big story not defending Cheney just going wait a minute they've
[10:33.320 --> 10:39.640]  had death squads well forever but they've had you know these fully constituted
[10:39.640 --> 10:45.760]  death squads out of Fort Bragg and the helicopters that deliver them are out of
[10:45.760 --> 10:51.760]  Fort Campbell Kentucky the night stalkers you know since 1979 you know they
[10:51.760 --> 10:56.480]  claimed it was set up in 1980 but the real day is 1979 and so you know the
[10:56.480 --> 11:00.280]  media obsessed on that and then Psyhurst did break what we already had inside
[11:00.280 --> 11:04.080]  sources saying day one we said remember the Iranian patrol boats came out and
[11:04.080 --> 11:08.240]  said in English we're gonna blow you up in 60 seconds and I said ladies and
[11:08.240 --> 11:11.800]  gentlemen that is completely fake you're not gonna have these and plus the
[11:11.800 --> 11:15.880]  video the patrol boats they were like two miles away and and the generals came
[11:15.880 --> 11:18.880]  on TV and said they were threatening to attack we need to go ahead and go to war
[11:18.880 --> 11:25.600]  and then Admiral Fox Fallon the head of CENTCOM quits because he refused to
[11:25.600 --> 11:28.600]  launch the attack on Iran they were gonna say that was the attack then
[11:28.600 --> 11:32.160]  Cheney cooked up the plan this has been confirmed the White House hasn't denied
[11:32.160 --> 11:35.260]  it in fact they came out and said we want to arrest whoever leaked that they
[11:35.260 --> 11:39.680]  wanted to paint up US patrol boats like blue Iranian boats and have them
[11:39.680 --> 11:44.360]  actually attack US naval ships in the Strait of Hormuz so that's all
[11:44.360 --> 11:49.440]  confirmed says Cheney was the chief of joint special operations command and he
[11:49.440 --> 11:53.720]  cleared the way for the US by exterminating opponents through the unit
[11:53.720 --> 11:58.520]  and the CIA general Stanley was in charge of the unit the nations quoted
[11:58.520 --> 12:03.280]  US columnist Seymour Hersh is saying the US death unit killed Budo because she
[12:03.280 --> 12:07.400]  told Al Jazeera TV about the assassination of Osama bin Laden her set
[12:07.400 --> 12:12.200]  US leadership did not want Obama to be declared dead it would have raised
[12:12.200 --> 12:16.560]  questions about the US Army's presence in Afghanistan he claimed according to
[12:16.560 --> 12:21.920]  Hersh the former Lebanese Prime Minister Al Harari and the army chief were
[12:21.920 --> 12:26.640]  murdered for not safeguarding US interest and for refusing to set up US
[12:26.640 --> 12:32.200]  bases in Lebanon Ariel Sharon then Prime Minister of Israel was also a key man
[12:32.200 --> 12:38.760]  in the plot okay now that's what came out last night this is out of the dawn
[12:38.760 --> 12:49.920]  newspaper today this literally came out five minutes ago I did not say Cheney
[12:49.920 --> 12:55.960]  killed Benazir Seymour Hersh is the headline and it goes on the story
[12:55.960 --> 12:59.200]  regarding Hersh's reported claim that Cheney ordered the assassination of
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.800]  Benazir Budo was published on our website among other publications we
[13:03.800 --> 13:07.480]  regret the error says the dawn newspaper Washington American journalist Seymour
[13:07.480 --> 13:11.320]  Hersh on Monday denied news reports this is Monday night that quoted him as
[13:11.320 --> 13:15.200]  saying a special death squad working under former US president Dick Cheney
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.640]  has killed Benazir Budo the award-winning journalist described as complete madness
[13:19.640 --> 13:26.200]  the reports the squad headed by General Stanley McChrystal the new commander of
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.640]  US Army in Afghanistan had also killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq
[13:30.640 --> 13:36.400]  Al Harari and Lebanese Army Chief Vice President Cheney does not have a death
[13:36.400 --> 13:43.840]  squad I have no idea who killed Mr. Harari or Mrs. Budo I have never said
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.240]  and I have had no such information I most certainly did not say anything
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.280]  remotely to the effect during an interview with the Arab media outlet
[13:53.280 --> 13:59.600]  Hersh said wait a minute Hersh we have the video clips of you on TV and we
[13:59.600 --> 14:05.600]  have MSNBC CNN Fox you name it a few months ago we have those linked up in
[14:05.600 --> 14:09.480]  the article Paul Watson wrote actually exposing the fact that these death
[14:09.480 --> 14:15.200]  squads are publicly admitted to going back to 1979 where Hersh says Cheney
[14:15.200 --> 14:20.440]  had these death squads we got to do a story on this I don't want to attack
[14:20.440 --> 14:24.480]  Hersh but man when you're back peddling I mean I don't know about the Benazir
[14:24.480 --> 14:27.280]  Budo thing I don't know if you really told the TV station that or not we can't
[14:27.280 --> 14:33.200]  find any video of it but we don't speak Arabic so it's hard to find it and read
[14:33.200 --> 14:38.720]  it and get it somebody's got an email up to us Rob D the letter D at infowars.com
[14:38.720 --> 14:48.080]  but we know Hersh went on television and spoke before
[14:48.080 --> 14:52.480]  universities multiple times talking about the death squads but the fact that
[14:52.480 --> 14:57.160]  the CIA has hit teams I mean that's public knowledge that they use the army
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.200]  to do it well you call it the army it's under the army but it's a joint forces
[15:01.200 --> 15:07.440]  command they draw from all the services the Navy seals the green berets all of
[15:07.440 --> 15:16.720]  them so very bizarre out of Hersh I bet he's getting a lot of heat in a last
[15:16.720 --> 15:20.640]  night when Jason was on the air nine to midnight covering this I thought man why
[15:20.640 --> 15:24.160]  is her still alive I know he waited to bring all this out till after Bush was
[15:24.160 --> 15:28.960]  out of power and we've separately confirmed all of this but but look how
[15:28.960 --> 15:34.360]  do I know the West killed Benazir Budo or at least one of their friends did and
[15:34.360 --> 15:38.120]  it was in the interest of the Anglo-American Crimes Indicate because
[15:38.120 --> 15:43.560]  there was there's video of Benazir Budo being machine gun she's shot flies up
[15:43.560 --> 15:47.880]  against the car then a diversionary car bomb goes off that's how black ops
[15:47.880 --> 15:52.120]  always operates I'm surprised they didn't have a troop of midgets parachuted in
[15:52.120 --> 15:56.840]  or something you know they always just mix it up with the fog of war to confuse
[15:56.840 --> 16:05.760]  everything and but the big telltale sign wasn't just how they killed her or the
[16:05.760 --> 16:08.760]  fact that she'd kind of breaking away from the West it wasn't following orders
[16:08.760 --> 16:13.560]  it was in a name not just that she was going on TV and in print interviews saying
[16:13.560 --> 16:17.640]  bin Laden works for the CIA they've already killed bin Laden things that
[16:17.640 --> 16:22.360]  we've confirmed from multiple inside sources separately
[16:26.200 --> 16:33.560]  now the big telltale sign in all of this big blaring red flag that lets us
[16:33.560 --> 16:39.920]  know who's behind this the banner the logo that documents who's behind it is
[16:39.920 --> 16:44.520]  that the Western media said from minutes after she was killed that she died
[16:44.520 --> 16:50.120]  hitting her head that she hit her head on the car it doesn't matter if in a
[16:50.120 --> 16:55.240]  crowded street and market on a major thoroughfare she is murdered in plain
[16:55.240 --> 17:01.480]  broad daylight shot multiple times in the chest and head right in front of
[17:01.480 --> 17:06.560]  everybody in news cameras that doesn't matter they have such disrespect for the
[17:06.560 --> 17:09.760]  American people and the British people and the Canadian people and Europeans
[17:09.760 --> 17:14.600]  that all over the Asian news all over the Middle Eastern news they said she was

[24:55.920 --> 25:01.000]  well I first want to give props to we are change L.A. that's some incredible
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.880]  video they got there very professionally handled I would say yeah we're gonna play
[25:06.880 --> 25:11.200]  that when we start simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv I'm gonna go ahead and
[25:11.200 --> 25:15.800]  go live at prisonplanet.tv for the full final three hours starting next hour
[25:15.800 --> 25:20.160]  with John Perkins confessions of an economic hit man but yeah that's just
[25:20.160 --> 25:24.800]  amazing video with the vice president up close calmly being given the peer
[25:24.800 --> 25:32.760]  reviewed study about nanothermite confirmed blowing up the towers while
[25:32.760 --> 25:36.760]  we're on the issue of 9-11 I'd like to ask you have you have you seen the new
[25:36.760 --> 25:41.600]  program on history formally the history channel called life after
[25:41.600 --> 25:50.400]  people yes I have read the book and I've not seen the show but it's based on the
[25:50.400 --> 25:54.640]  book and I have seen the fellow on national news saying how he is you know
[25:54.640 --> 25:58.400]  basically a eugenicist he's calling for a world without people and then saying so
[25:58.400 --> 26:02.040]  I made this so everybody could see how great it would be without us this is
[26:02.040 --> 26:08.360]  about getting rid of our survival instinct branding eugenicist system as
[26:08.360 --> 26:13.200]  environmentalism and drilling the public like Jim Jones cult followers that
[26:13.200 --> 26:17.720]  humans are the problem and turning our survival instinct against ourselves
[26:17.720 --> 26:22.120]  it's about taking our survival instinct and then moving it under the animals in
[26:22.120 --> 26:26.920]  the earth so that we still have our survival instinct but psychologically
[26:26.920 --> 26:32.360]  twisted to then focus our survival instinct into destroying ourselves and
[26:32.360 --> 26:36.920]  so that's what we're being taught is that we're the enemy we're bad and the
[26:36.920 --> 26:41.200]  state will then direct this against us the Romans did this with the gladiatorial
[26:41.200 --> 26:44.960]  events where you would see the prisoners and the so-called criminals being torn
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.520]  apart every weekend at the free Coliseum and then it wouldn't matter if you were
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.800]  in their next week being torn apart you had been dehumanized you had seen the
[26:53.800 --> 26:56.960]  violence in the arena you'd seen your neighbors being killed and so your
[26:56.960 --> 27:00.920]  neighbors wouldn't care about you when you were being killed six months later
[27:00.920 --> 27:05.600]  that's just a way to dehumanize you though this is further this is a way of
[27:05.600 --> 27:11.120]  quote having humanity and then because you love life you hate humanity and
[27:11.120 --> 27:16.280]  want to kill yourself this is the very sick psychological warfare that's what
[27:16.280 --> 27:19.280]  Richard in Haas wrote in the early 90s for the club of Rome republished two
[27:19.280 --> 27:22.520]  years ago in the council on foreign relations he said we will use phony
[27:22.520 --> 27:26.920]  terrorism as one pincer to police and control the public and take their rights
[27:26.920 --> 27:31.520]  and the other pincer that will grab them in will be the fake environmentalism
[27:31.520 --> 27:36.080]  carbon taxes to regulate and control every facet of life and and and as I
[27:36.080 --> 27:39.920]  announced years ago in the US in England they're now saying spy on your
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.560]  neighbor for environmental reasons and then they go ahead and add and for terror
[27:44.560 --> 27:49.320]  and for guns and for marijuana and then it's kosher and acceptable to spy
[27:49.320 --> 27:53.640]  because after all anything to save the earth and you know oh it's okay to have
[27:53.640 --> 27:57.520]  the youth marching around in red and black uniforms you know part of secure
[27:57.520 --> 28:03.160]  core it's for the earth and for terror you see we're doing this to fight for
[28:03.160 --> 28:09.840]  the earth you're not against the earth are you Joe no sir well then why don't
[28:09.840 --> 28:13.600]  you just kill yourself according to them that you know it's for the earth sir
[28:13.600 --> 28:17.240]  see see that way as we're going to FEMA camps and losing our rights and having
[28:17.240 --> 28:22.280]  one job policies and forced abortions it's of the earth I mean it's a hard
[28:22.280 --> 28:29.360]  choice but it's got to be done it's what we've got to do for mother earth it's
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.720]  what we've got to do we got to have the control freak power to save the earth
[28:33.720 --> 28:40.880]  man and killing all these people we're gonna be heroes man come on man come on
[28:40.880 --> 28:48.080]  man it's good it's what the bankers need I'm go ahead Joe Joe come on you'll be

[28:59.880 --> 29:04.800]  particularly the buildings collapsing in the future where humans aren't around
[29:04.800 --> 29:08.480]  anymore in the future and they show a picture of the Christ we're building
[29:08.480 --> 29:12.200]  and I put it out by side with the World Trade Center when it starts to collapse
[29:12.200 --> 29:15.640]  yeah that's all part of them teaching you that magically steel buildings will
[29:15.640 --> 29:20.320]  collapse on their own again they insert their propaganda everywhere what's the
[29:20.320 --> 29:24.400]  what's the subject line of that article and I'll we'll look at it and probably
[29:24.400 --> 29:34.640]  post it believe it is life after people propaganda when did you send it I sent

[34:05.400 --> 34:10.480]  can you hear me can you hear me and I'm right here okay well God bless you Alex
[34:10.480 --> 34:18.240]  and I was very happy to see the video in the article on Ron Paul's headway on
[34:18.240 --> 34:29.200]  the auditing the Fed I was also very happy to see that sheriff I believe it
[34:29.200 --> 34:36.240]  was in Arizona they called for all the sheriffs across the country to stand
[34:36.240 --> 34:40.000]  against gun confiscation and all these things I don't know if you've seen it
[34:40.000 --> 34:46.200]  he's a member of both keepers it was I think I saw I even thought on your
[34:46.200 --> 34:53.240]  website or Steve quail I know you know Steve quail well which sheriff is it
[34:53.240 --> 34:59.160]  I'm sorry I didn't write his name down but I thought the YouTube video you know
[34:59.160 --> 35:06.000]  after reading the article on it you know was it was it Richard Mack oh well
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.120]  that matter that matter that matter well song your mind well I just wanted to
[35:12.120 --> 35:16.760]  tell you something that I was an eyewitness member of you know it's not
[35:16.760 --> 35:26.280]  hearsay I was you know pleased to be informed by a member of Ron Paul's
[35:26.280 --> 35:32.120]  committee when he was still considering running for presidency and he had kind of
[35:32.120 --> 35:38.200]  talked me into a going ahead and meeting him in a local Republican get
[35:38.200 --> 35:41.960]  together to sign up to be a delegate because there was a good a real
[35:41.960 --> 35:48.560]  conservative man running for the state Senate seat of a year ago and now when
[35:48.560 --> 35:52.760]  we got there there was a real ground swell of support you know by true
[35:52.760 --> 35:56.600]  conservatives and then there was a lot of us kind of what you'd call him to
[35:56.600 --> 36:04.480]  cover Ron Paul supporters there but when we got there elderly man that was a
[36:04.480 --> 36:11.400]  member of the John Burt society came up to us and said that he had heard that you
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.720]  know that former governor that was running for the Republican or the
[36:16.720 --> 36:22.440]  opposer of this other guy the Republican committee had joined the council on
[36:22.440 --> 36:27.920]  farm relations and then we were told that he had gotten money from the
[36:27.920 --> 36:34.840]  Democratic person to kind of try to run a smear campaign against it the true
[36:34.840 --> 36:42.520]  conservative excuse me person that was running for Senate and now the true
[36:42.520 --> 36:48.200]  conservative man was winning pretty much the hallway until it got to the north
[36:48.200 --> 36:53.560]  northern Virginia delegate Ralph area and then at the last minute he lost
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.320]  yeah there was all sorts of chicanery going on to try to keep Ron Paul out of
[36:58.320 --> 37:03.600]  things I appreciate the call Sam let's go ahead now and go to JD in Minnesota JD
[37:03.600 --> 37:08.480]  go ahead God bless your brother and protect you thanks JD I'm carrying
[37:08.480 --> 37:14.600]  father or four from Minnesota former Texan welcome doing today good good you
[37:14.600 --> 37:17.960]  know what I want to know what you think on how we can best get through to our
[37:17.960 --> 37:22.640]  law enforcement personnel is this stuff starts coming to a head because you know
[37:22.640 --> 37:25.880]  contrary to popular belief in the Department of Homeland Security
[37:25.880 --> 37:31.160]  lexicons I personally am not anti law enforcement actually I feel bad for a
[37:31.160 --> 37:36.560]  lot of these guys I'm sending a copy of Sheriff Richard max book to our Hennepin
[37:36.560 --> 37:42.320]  County Sheriff Richard Stanek who was instrumental in passing the shelf carry
[37:42.320 --> 37:49.480]  law here in Minnesota but what more can we do I mean just a regular every day
[37:49.480 --> 37:56.560]  officers I mean I've given out both keepers blogspot address as many police
[37:56.560 --> 38:00.720]  officers as I can including one Rogers officer that I talked to on law
[38:00.720 --> 38:05.120]  enforcement Memorial Day because these guys are going to be key you know with
[38:05.120 --> 38:08.640]  our troops everywhere else our local law enforcement officers are going to be
[38:08.640 --> 38:13.520]  important well number one they're not law enforcement officers but that's what
[38:13.520 --> 38:18.120]  they call them supposedly peace officers duly sworn under the Bill of Rights
[38:18.120 --> 38:24.360]  Constitution and state laws and they have slowly militarized the police they
[38:24.360 --> 38:30.120]  have slowly merged them with the regular military they have slowly turned many of
[38:30.120 --> 38:34.680]  them in their culture against the public and they have their continuum of you
[38:34.680 --> 38:39.680]  know force spectrum where they ratchet things up and everything is about being
[38:39.680 --> 38:44.440]  in control everything is about making you submit and so they have pressure
[38:44.440 --> 38:52.000]  tactics they've legalized torture they call it paying compliance they taser us
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.120]  for not submitting tyranny always comes whether it was Cambodia or Soviet Russia
[38:57.120 --> 39:03.320]  or Communist China or Communist Cuba it all I mean in ancient Rome under you
[39:03.320 --> 39:10.760]  know that tyranny it came to your door as paramilitary as police as the
[39:10.760 --> 39:16.760]  Praetorian and so we have to get our minds around this that about 99% of the
[39:16.760 --> 39:21.560]  time in history the police are corrupt because the government is corrupt and
[39:21.560 --> 39:27.200]  it's a necessary evil because you do have criminals you do have problems in
[39:27.200 --> 39:31.880]  society but nine times out of ten even in small Western towns in this country's
[39:31.880 --> 39:36.080]  history you know the sheriffs and people would become corrupt that's how it
[39:36.080 --> 39:40.360]  works they end up working with the criminals and a lot of that's because
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.160]  criminals will fight back criminals you know regular criminals will shoot back
[39:44.160 --> 39:49.920]  and so cops tend to go ahead and want to work with them and and get paid off by
[39:49.920 --> 39:56.120]  them and the average cop is not corrupt is not mafia but they are out there
[39:56.120 --> 40:01.240]  revenue generating and that's what it's all about for the government itself that
[40:01.240 --> 40:04.440]  has turned into an illegitimate rogue government and then when you get into your
[40:04.440 --> 40:08.840]  police detectives and your narcotics officers in the big cities most of them
[40:08.840 --> 40:11.760]  and we've talked to a lot of police officers and former narcotics officers
[40:11.760 --> 40:18.160]  they say about 85% deal drugs I mean I've grown up I've known all sorts of FBI
[40:18.160 --> 40:22.400]  agents and cops living in half million dollar houses driving brand new Corvettes
[40:22.400 --> 40:26.560]  they're dealing drugs folks they're laundering money and that's why the
[40:26.560 --> 40:29.920]  government wanted to make drugs illegal was to corrupt the police because then
[40:29.920 --> 40:35.480]  it makes incredible profits and makes them fabulously wealthy in this process
[40:35.480 --> 40:41.120]  of tyranny you know the the red coats were the police and they were the bad
[40:41.120 --> 40:46.840]  guys and it's the same thing throughout history you know use a Star Wars analogy
[40:46.840 --> 40:50.520]  because folks love that all the stormtroopers are the Imperial police
[40:50.520 --> 40:56.400]  are they the good guys know they're not it's it's it's very very simple and we
[40:56.400 --> 40:59.000]  have to get our minds around that that if the government isn't following the
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.640]  Civil Rights and Constitution the police and military are then engaged in treason
[41:05.640 --> 41:09.960]  and they know they are that's why they're trying to bully people and intimidate
[41:09.960 --> 41:12.960]  people and bring this journey and now I know the average cop because I get
[41:12.960 --> 41:16.520]  hundreds of emails from every month and phone calls and cops on the street come
[41:16.520 --> 41:21.840]  over and talk to me and I understand that but it doesn't matter we're going the
[41:21.840 --> 41:25.480]  direction we're going they're not speaking up as much as they should they're
[41:25.480 --> 41:29.240]  not standing up if they do they get persecuted and we have been fully
[41:29.240 --> 41:32.960]  hijacked by foreign offshore banks we've had a corporate takeover of the
[41:32.960 --> 41:36.240]  United States we have a race to the bottom where they play different
[41:36.240 --> 41:38.920]  nations off against each other while the globalists are outside the nation
[41:38.920 --> 41:43.120]  states and we're going into a new dark age where they overlay of
[41:43.120 --> 41:49.320]  technocracy so you know a lot of these police as things implode they're gonna
[41:49.320 --> 41:51.800]  have even more pressure to do what they're told to try to keep their job
[41:51.800 --> 41:55.640]  they'll even be more scared in the economy and a lot of regular citizens
[41:55.640 --> 41:58.840]  and government bureaucrats are going to do horrible things because they're
[41:58.840 --> 42:02.080]  scared want to keep their paycheck things are going to get worse as things
[42:02.080 --> 42:06.120]  get tough and as more and more pressures put on the public and as the
[42:06.120 --> 42:09.640]  government she snatches more people's children and as the government you know
[42:09.640 --> 42:12.360]  engages in more crime you're gonna have more Americans they're not going to be
[42:12.360 --> 42:16.160]  able to get all the guns are gonna fight back and it's gonna escalate things
[42:16.160 --> 42:19.800]  militarily you're gonna have incredible carnage with the police and military
[42:19.800 --> 42:25.880]  getting getting wiped out they're gonna wipe out a lot of citizens and the
[42:25.880 --> 42:32.960]  bankers are gonna sit offshore laughing like they always do and it's just an
[42:32.960 --> 42:38.200]  absolute nightmare but it happens everywhere else and now what's happening
[42:38.200 --> 42:42.240]  here and we just have a complete whorehouse congress a complete whorehouse
[42:42.240 --> 42:48.480]  government obviously some of them are good Ron Paul's got 120 something now in
[42:48.480 --> 42:59.640]  fact guys pull up that video it's on info wars.com the headline is Ron Paul
[42:59.640 --> 43:06.600]  says audit the Fed and then abolish it that's the headline let's let's pull
[43:06.600 --> 43:15.720]  that up and play that for people a little bit later in the show play the
[43:15.720 --> 43:22.240]  audio of that because he really it's story under them let's go ahead and
[43:22.240 --> 43:26.000]  take another phone call here yeah there it is audit the Fed and then abolish it
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.520]  let's go ahead and take another call here let's talk to Mark no Mark and
[43:30.520 --> 43:35.360]  Georgia hung up JD we just talked to JD John in West Virginia John you're on the
[43:35.360 --> 43:41.480]  year go ahead hey Alex one of my friends turned me on to you about five
[43:41.480 --> 43:50.840]  months ago you know I was I was like okay a bomb is in I had no clue to no no I
[43:50.840 --> 43:56.280]  had no idea to the depths of what these people do and I've watched you know all
[43:56.280 --> 44:02.920]  your videos I'll even you know get on American Free Press Liberty Times and I
[44:02.920 --> 44:06.760]  try to educate my friends why even like I love them to death and I'm
[44:06.760 --> 44:10.200]  trying to tell them you know listen this is what's going on and like you know
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.280]  you have no proof of this it's just on the internet you know it's not real
[44:13.280 --> 44:18.600]  because I see do you think they're gonna put on Fox News CNN you know here you go
[44:18.600 --> 44:25.800]  you know by the way well actually they do now see what happens is habits are
[44:25.800 --> 44:29.280]  things we do over and over again they become comfortable they become second
[44:29.280 --> 44:36.800]  nature that's why 90% of the car wrecks in the nation happened within 15 miles of
[44:36.800 --> 44:41.800]  home commuting because you drive that drive to work every day and drive it
[44:41.800 --> 44:46.520]  back you walk in the 7-11 and get the Coca-Cola and the pack of cigarettes or
[44:46.520 --> 44:49.960]  you know whatever it is you're getting you know you buy the six pack of beer
[44:49.960 --> 44:55.520]  after work you almost get in zombie mode well that psychology is the same way
[44:55.520 --> 45:00.320]  with government all these decades you know they would show Archie Bunker
[45:00.320 --> 45:04.000]  saying there was a banker conspiracy to get our guns and every and the laugh
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.960]  track laughs you know in 1973 so thousands of TV programs later thousands
[45:10.960 --> 45:15.120]  of brainwashing newscasts and dramas and sitcoms with messages implanted
[45:15.120 --> 45:18.920]  thousands of you know news articles later saying there's no world government
[45:18.920 --> 45:22.760]  there's no international banks there's no plan to set up a global government
[45:22.760 --> 45:28.360]  there's no plan to set up a carbon tax they were taught that that didn't exist
[45:28.360 --> 45:33.360]  and Rush Limbaugh got on the radio and said the CFR didn't even exist on and
[45:33.360 --> 45:40.160]  on and on and on and so now it doesn't matter if there's been more than a
[45:40.160 --> 45:43.600]  thousand mainstream news articles that I've seen I mean hundreds a week for the
[45:43.600 --> 45:47.680]  last few months it's in the multi-thousand saying yes here's how the
[45:47.680 --> 45:51.000]  world government's gonna work a private group of banks will own the planet you
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.200]  will pay your carbon taxes to them but it's good it's for the earth and these
[45:54.200 --> 45:58.520]  are the banking experts who know how to fix it when they engineered it but they
[45:58.520 --> 46:01.600]  don't tell you that and they just lay out and yes your neighbors are gonna
[46:01.600 --> 46:04.520]  spy on you but it's for your own good and yes there's gonna be youth brigades
[46:04.520 --> 46:08.120]  and yes we're gonna put you on secret lists and I'll let you own guns that's
[46:08.120 --> 46:12.680]  actually in Fox News and so all these years folks were told that didn't exist
[46:12.680 --> 46:17.480]  so now when it's announced their habit their instinct their programming is they
[46:17.480 --> 46:22.440]  can't admit to themselves that this has really happened
[46:22.440 --> 46:32.520]  and so they liked being lazy they like believing everything was fine they like
[46:32.520 --> 46:37.960]  believing you didn't have to be involved in society they liked believing that life
[46:37.960 --> 46:40.800]  is all about just going to work and partying and having a good time and
[46:40.800 --> 46:45.840]  watching TV and that there's no adult responsibility when the truth is is that
[46:45.840 --> 46:52.880]  for the first you know tens of thousands of years of what we call humanity or
[46:52.880 --> 46:57.040]  longer it was a struggle every day just to survive just to not have your children
[46:57.040 --> 47:01.720]  starve to death to not freeze the death not have big cats or big bears you know
[47:01.720 --> 47:08.120]  come in and to your village and you know grab dinner and then cities started
[47:08.120 --> 47:11.880]  developing agrarian villages and societies and then tyranny was set up
[47:11.880 --> 47:14.760]  immediately you got a few thousand humans together they would become a
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.720]  hierarchical system and a system of control and sometimes you had good kings
[47:18.720 --> 47:24.760]  and good chiefs sometimes you had crazy ones but always that you know the big
[47:24.760 --> 47:28.560]  war chief you know who knew how to hunt knew how to fish you knew how to you
[47:28.560 --> 47:33.360]  know lead the tribe he didn't control and then he would say my son is gonna rule
[47:33.360 --> 47:38.040]  that's how royalty began and they would put on a fancy headdress to show
[47:38.040 --> 47:42.440]  everybody they were the chief and that's what kings are today I mean old wicked
[47:42.440 --> 47:48.000]  witches wearing crowns with diamonds and rubies and crystals you know literal
[47:48.000 --> 47:54.000]  monkey hats to to to say to everybody you know I have the power I have the
[47:54.000 --> 48:11.800]  control I have everything that's what it is and and of course the answer I
[48:11.800 --> 48:17.200]  appreciate your call he's still there okay he's gone I will we'll let him go
[48:17.200 --> 48:21.040]  that's a really great you know question and point you brought up so so this is
[48:21.040 --> 48:28.080]  how this is how society operates is that you can go back 10 20 30 thousand
[48:28.080 --> 48:36.600]  years into into antiquity into human development and tribal societies and the
[48:36.600 --> 48:41.480]  the the war chief he might have a guy leading a band of 20 30 people who are
[48:41.480 --> 48:46.200]  all family relations who related to each other and and he you know he leads them
[48:46.200 --> 48:51.360]  to better hunting grounds he leads them you know into a new territory and they
[48:51.360 --> 48:55.040]  find a smaller band of people and they don't kill them they end up merging they
[48:55.040 --> 48:59.520]  end up getting you know intermarried and so now the band is a couple hundred
[48:59.520 --> 49:04.360]  people and then they merge with a few more bands of you know nomadic travelers
[49:04.360 --> 49:09.640]  and they merge with a nomadic band that knows how to plant crops and so they
[49:09.640 --> 49:16.520]  settle by a river and 20 30 years later there's a thousand of them and then you
[49:16.520 --> 49:22.360]  fast forward 200 years there is 10,000 people living on the river bank or
[49:22.360 --> 49:28.440]  living on the seashore and the great great great great grandson of that
[49:28.440 --> 49:34.680]  original chief is completely spoiled rotten he has a witch doctor that tells
[49:34.680 --> 49:41.480]  him he's God he doesn't like a responsibility of having to figure out
[49:41.480 --> 49:45.160]  how to feed these 10,000 people so he already has a disdain for the lower
[49:45.160 --> 49:49.840]  classes he wears a fancy feathered headdress everybody bows down to him
[49:49.840 --> 49:55.400]  that's Queen Elizabeth the second that's all she is as a modern incarnation of
[49:55.400 --> 50:00.280]  that and so of course the people are gonna rebel out of the 10,000 folks
[50:00.280 --> 50:07.120]  living in that little city on the river and so they develop a inner group of
[50:07.120 --> 50:13.440]  enforcers who are the cousins and the you know brothers and the neighbors and the
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.360]  friends and the and and Krollgaard's wife's brother you know the good old
[50:18.360 --> 50:24.160]  boy club and they wear police uniforms they wear headdresses and they wear
[50:24.160 --> 50:30.000]  sashes or they wear loincloths that are a certain color nobody else is allowed to
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.920]  wear those because that's the color of the guard if you go back to Rome it was
[50:33.920 --> 50:38.720]  blue that's why police wear blue the Pretorian were blue and they you know
[50:38.720 --> 50:42.400]  have fancy gold medallions everybody bows down and they take more grain for
[50:42.400 --> 50:46.360]  themselves they take more wine for themselves they take the women they
[50:46.360 --> 50:49.920]  want and that's called tyranny and that's how we live and that's what we do as a
[50:49.920 --> 50:57.720]  species and it's happened now for dirt bags now we could change that but who

[1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:43.520]  simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv right now I remember interviewing John Perkins
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:47.120]  before his book was on the New York Times bestseller and became a I think
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:51.480]  number one didn't it and then he's got a new book coming out and we just really
[1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:54.880]  appreciate him coming on the show John Perkins has lived four lives as an
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:59.680]  economic hit man as a CEO of a successful alternative energy company who was
[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:06.440]  rewarded for not disclosing his EHM past as an expert of indigenous cultures
[1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:10.640]  and shamanism a teacher and a writer he uses experience promote ecology and
[1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:15.600]  sustainability while continuing to honor his vow of silence about his life as
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:20.040]  the EHM and it just goes on from there you know John Perkins it's probably
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:23.720]  better that you haven't been on this in a few years introduce yourself tell your
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:27.640]  story you know in kind of an encapsulated version the next 10-15
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:32.360]  minutes and then let's get into your expert take from the inside on what the
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:35.560]  international banks are doing right now you know their own IMF World Bank
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:39.400]  documents state that they are engineering these collapses to bring in
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:43.960]  greater control John Perkins good to have you with us thanks Alex it's great
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:47.800]  to be with you again yes you got the floor we're about to break in a few
[1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:56.000]  minutes but tell folks about your saga who you are and okay well I I was an
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:59.640]  economic hit man and I think it's fair to say that we economic hit men have
[1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:03.480]  managed to create the world's first truly global empire and for the first time
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:06.840]  in history it's an empire that's been created primarily without the military
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:10.800]  through economics through people like me and we work many different ways but
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:14.400]  perhaps the most common is that we will identify a third world country that has
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:19.120]  resources our corporations covet like oil and then arrange huge loan to that
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:22.560]  country from the World Bank and its sisters but the money doesn't actually
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:27.080]  go to the country instead it goes to our own corporations to build big
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:31.240]  infrastructure projects in that country things like power plants highways and
[1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:35.880]  industrial parks that benefit a few wealthy people in that country as well
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:39.600]  as our own corporations of course but don't help the majority of the people
[1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:44.360]  at all because they're too poor to buy the electricity to have cars to drive on
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:48.360]  the highways they don't have the skills to get jobs in industrial parks but they
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:52.920]  are left holding a huge debt the whole country is it's a debt so large that it
[1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:58.120]  can't possibly be repaid and so at some point we economic hit men go back into
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:01.840]  that country and say listen you owe us money you can't pay your debts give us
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:06.680]  a pound of flesh sell your oil real cheap to oil companies or vote with us on
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:11.120]  an on an United Nations vote that's critical or send troops in support of
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:15.120]  ours to someplace in the world like Iraq and on the few occasions when we
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:18.680]  economic hit men fail Alex and I talk in my books about how I failed with
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:23.320]  Jaime Roldos president of Ecuador and Omar to rehost the Panama when we
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:27.160]  failed in the jackals go in and these are people that either overthrow
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:31.000]  governments or assassinate their leaders because I couldn't bring Roldos
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.440]  to Ecuador and to rehost the Panama round I couldn't get them to accept these
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:41.440]  large honoris rote loans both of them were assassinated by CI sponsored jackals
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:46.000]  and on the few occasions when the jackals also fail which is what happened in
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:49.720]  Iraq with Saddam Hussein that both the economic hit men and the jackals were
[1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:55.000]  unable to get through to Hussein Saddam Hussein on those few occasions then and
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.560]  only then do we send in the military and so we have this empire today that's a
[1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:03.680]  global empire that's been created pretty secretly because most of us aren't aware
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:07.600]  that the sort of thing is going on and it's the world's first truly global
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:14.160]  empire been created primarily without the military and in secret well John

[1:06:08.280 --> 1:06:12.680]  stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to
[1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:17.800]  say the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[1:06:17.800 --> 1:06:21.760]  for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging

[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:18.120]  happy to do that and incidentally the answer to the last question about what's
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:22.240]  going on now and i have a new book coming out in in early november which
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:24.920]  addresses that it's working title of hoodwinked i don't know whether it'll be
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:29.760]  a final title but really encourage people to subscribe to my newsletter just go
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:34.800]  to john perkins dot org newsletter you know sign up list and and sign on and
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:37.160]  we'll let them know when the books out and what the title because it goes into
[1:09:37.160 --> 1:09:42.120]  these subjects i was recruited by the national security agency the nation's
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:47.400]  largest and most secretive spy organization that will have that my last
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:52.080]  year in college in in boston i and and i went through a whole series of lie
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:56.640]  detector tests and other tests that they did they determined that i would make a
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:10:00.720]  good economic hit man and they also found that i had several hooks that they
[1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:04.080]  could use to really encourage me to come in i think that three big drugs that
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:13.320]  that's our culture i was kind of hooked on sex power and those are the big one
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:17.720]  sex power and money and uh... they determine all that and that they could
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:19.680]  they could get me into the fold
[1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:23.440]  it's a it's a long story it's written up in concessions in some detail
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:28.120]  uh... but eventually i ended up working for a private organization charlesty
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:31.480]  main i became the chief economist and and all of this sort of work that was
[1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:32.680]  done not true
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:35.880]  uh... employees of the government directly but took up side uh...
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:37.280]  consultants through
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:40.640]  you know it's it's farmed out of the company so the government is actually
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:42.560]  playing any active role
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:43.920]  so i would get caught
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:47.200]  it wouldn't blame the government they would just blame another dirty business
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:51.960]  so there's corporate surrogates now that they use correct correct and of course
[1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:55.680]  this is back in nineteen seventy it's become much more prevalent today than
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:56.640]  it was then
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:59.880]  but even then in in this particular case i tell a story about the first
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:02.120]  economic hitman kermit roosevelt
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:06.280]  who went over to a government in iran and he was a cia agent he was very
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:08.080]  successful at this point he did
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:10.520]  but very soon after that they decided that
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:14.000]  it shouldn't be a government agent the cia agent should be someone working for
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.240]  a private corporation
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:20.440]  that's where i came in my job really was to corrupt president and and and and
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:22.000]  other top officials
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.640]  of countries that had resources that are corporations covet oil being one of the
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:28.000]  biggest ones but there are many others also
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.320]  and to really corrupt these people to get them to accept huge loans for their
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:32.360]  country
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:35.480]  uh... loans that would basically bankrupt the country wouldn't be used to really
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:37.200]  help the majority of the people
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:40.880]  would be used to hire u's corporations to build big infrastructure projects like
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:42.640]  power plant in their country
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:45.640]  they would help a few wealthy families who own the big industries in the
[1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:47.280]  commercial establishment
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:50.040]  but the whole country would be left holding a huge debt
[1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:51.400]  they couldn't repay
[1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:54.480]  so at some point we go back and say that you can't repay your debt give us your
[1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:55.720]  oil real cheap
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:58.920]  or vote with us on the next u n vote or something like that
[1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:02.800]  and when we when we weren't successful and i mentioned the book they might
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:07.400]  uh... situation in ecuador with the president there and also in panama i was
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:10.800]  not able to corrupt those two men roll those into rehost
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:13.600]  and so they were taken out they were fascinated
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:16.440]  uh... by c i a sponsored jackals once again
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:17.760]  contractor
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:19.600]  uh... consultants
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:24.160]  security consultants who are contracted the fact that not directly by the c i a
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:27.080]  and in that way we really managed to create this
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:28.240]  this empire
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:32.440]  the few occasions when the jackals and economic hit men are unsuccessful like
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:33.360]  in iraq
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:37.240]  then we send in the military of course the military always in the background
[1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:38.840]  these people all know that
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:44.160]  so today the president of afghanistan and pakistan they all know that the deal
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:48.440]  and they know that if they don't play the game with us on one level or another
[1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:49.480]  they're going to go
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:53.560]  and incidentally alex our own president have to understand this too
[1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:57.440]  i got like obama now taking a lot of criticism from his supporters and and a
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:12:59.040]  lot of it's very deserve
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:02.000]  but i think one of the things that's important first understand
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:03.040]  is that
[1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:06.360]  our own president of the staff made it in my lifetime
[1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:08.440]  and it's a constant threat
[1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:11.720]  and so that makes it all the more important that we the people keep
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:12.720]  demanding
[1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:17.280]  change we've got to keep the pressure on our politicians we've constantly got a
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:18.280]  pressure that
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:21.800]  we've got to put pressure on a guy like obama so he he can turn around to say
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:25.480]  that the idea or wherever he's answering to it this particular point in time
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:28.640]  let's say you guys i got to do this because the people are demanding it
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:30.400]  that's very very important
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:31.720]  absolutely
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:35.480]  uh... john perkins uh... you know i think what you just said is really the
[1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:36.800]  central
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:39.200]  uh... spoke to all of this
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:40.640]  and that is
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:45.200]  the united states is captured by this system western europe england canada
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:46.360]  australia
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:50.000]  as westerners we tend to think of ourselves as elitist that we're kind of
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.920]  part of the establishment of talk to a lot of good old boys
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:55.040]  who are upper middle class who are millionaires
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:13:58.160]  that feel like they're actually part of the elite and they're like yeah
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:01.200]  yeah we stage some terror attacks yeah we're
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:04.880]  i know about the current roosevelt did stage and terror attacks in iran
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:08.560]  uh... yeah you know that's how we win that's how we get things done but we're
[1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:12.400]  losing our freedoms and liberties here as well we're financing
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:16.440]  these international corporations and banks to go give these loans to build
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:19.280]  infrastructure which they themselves then own
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:21.520]  at our expense and then
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:22.880]  those third world nations
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:25.920]  and old world nations rightfully hate us
[1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:27.600]  and we get the blame for it
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:32.000]  when really we're being drug along by the system as well so this this globalist
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.440]  corporate system a crony capitalism as you call it doesn't exploit
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:38.960]  everybody except for what roth cop
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:40.880]  said on this show with his book
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:43.400]  uh... the head of kissinger associates
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:45.800]  the six thousand superclass
[1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:48.080]  uh... they get all the power money in control
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:49.880]  but the rest of the six billion
[1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:51.600]  uh... four hundred million of us
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:53.360]  we get the short end of the stick
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:56.720]  absolutely yeah you know what comes around goes around week
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:00.880]  we in the united states were willing to turn a blind eye on the use of
[1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:04.080]  of slaves essentially in sweatshops that make us cheap
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:05.760]  shirts and tennis shoes
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:10.080]  uh... we were willing to turn a blind eye on you get get us cheap oil even if
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:10.560]  it
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:14.240]  requires destroying the amazon rainforest we don't care just cheap oil
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:16.960]  we got turned a blind eye on that we always thought of that
[1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:20.400]  well of course they're doing the right thing like you're not hiring slaves
[1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:23.000]  and texaco isn't destroying the rainforest well
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.760]  like he is hiring slaves and texaco did destroy the rainforest in the huge
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:29.120]  lawsuit in ecuador right now that's going to be
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:31.960]  one against texaco
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:33.680]  they don't do the right thing
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:36.560]  and you know we've gone through this period that really started built in
[1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:40.120]  freedom in the economist for the scarred school of economics who is deeply
[1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:42.120]  embraced by ronald reagan
[1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:45.960]  uh... to get got us on this role of of this what i would call a newton
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:47.720]  virus of capitalism
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:50.080]  which is to say the corporate executive
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:51.600]  don't need to be controlled
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:55.040]  there's some sort of an elite unlike the rest of us who never do anything wrong
[1:15:55.040 --> 1:15:57.720]  i mean we don't have a lot to keep us from doing
[1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:02.160]  stealing or cheating on our income taxes or picking some of these pockets but
[1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:05.400]  these corporate executives they don't need any rules and regulations
[1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:07.160]  no more rules and regulations
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:10.120]  and everything should be privatized they should be running everything all
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:14.360]  controlling all the world's resources and let's give everybody lots and lots of
[1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:17.800]  credit get people to take lots and lots of credit well i'll tell you credit
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:19.400]  inflates people
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:21.320]  you know if you're a union member
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:22.560]  and you've got lots of
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:25.040]  loans you have big mortgage on your house
[1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:28.040]  you don't want to go out and pick it you don't join the picket line because you
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:31.840]  want to keep paying for your house your family has a place to live
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:35.840]  and so there's been all these things that were really came up in the in the
[1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:39.400]  seventies and in much more strongly in the eighties after reagan was elected
[1:16:39.400 --> 1:16:42.520]  and they've just continued through democrats and republicans alike i'd
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:45.000]  clinton was one of the worst
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.320]  they have served
[1:16:46.320 --> 1:16:50.400]  to put us all in this position that we could on a kitman back in the seventies
[1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:53.080]  we're doing to the rest of the world it was so successful in the rest of the
[1:16:53.080 --> 1:16:57.240]  world that it's been pulled on off and now we gotta get out of it alex we we
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:02.200]  can do it that we've got a set our hearts and minds and souls to doing it
[1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:05.200]  well let's look at the alternative and then we'll get into solutions
[1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:09.640]  and you know uh... get your expert opinion on the current climate
[1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:12.880]  and what you think those solutions the way out are
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:16.680]  but let's look at the alternative if they continue this process of their
[1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:17.880]  above the law
[1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:20.680]  the private federal reserve goes before congress and says
[1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:23.800]  no one can audits no agency no government
[1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:26.240]  uh... if this imperial power
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:28.440]  is allowed to continue will we have
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:32.520]  private bank chairman wearing crowns and being worshiped i mean that's the
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:34.680]  logical extension of this
[1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:37.560]  is kind of a hit larry and fewer precept
[1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:40.200]  where will be sought cheney and bush saying
[1:17:40.200 --> 1:17:42.840]  it's not illegal of the president does it if something's illegal in the
[1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:44.400]  president does it it's okay
[1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:47.680]  and we're now seeing uh... obama saying yeah we're going to continue
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:49.320]  no rights for detainees
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:52.480]  and yeah we're going to uh... you know continue having secrecy in the banking
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:55.160]  it's clear the president's have been turned to nothing but
[1:17:55.160 --> 1:17:56.080]  vestigial
[1:17:56.080 --> 1:17:57.680]  ceremonial creatures so
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:00.160]  if we don't slow this down and reverse it
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:02.400]  what will this world look like what will
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:04.360]  this superclass
[1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:06.360]  who are openly above the law
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:10.080]  what will they uh... bring us to
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:11.800]  will all be living in the nady
[1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:13.760]  you know that we're in and it's happening
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:15.960]  it's past that i just saw this morning that
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:19.200]  you have announced that bill clinton's going to be their new u n ambassador to
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:20.040]  haiti
[1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:23.240]  man at the fact that they think that comment right there
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:25.800]  uh... you know we're all again and we're at work
[1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:29.160]  we're certainly not position right now we're living very much like
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:31.280]  what we used to call banana republics
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:34.360]  i in fact those bank presidents are wearing crown today they're getting
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:38.560]  away literally with with murder i mean that they're getting away with stealing
[1:18:38.560 --> 1:18:39.600]  and and and
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:43.560]  great and pillage and they're being rewarded for it and that continues to
[1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:45.040]  happen
[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:48.520]  yet we're already in that world and it's going to get much worse unless we
[1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:52.760]  really do something and i think that he can't make economic crisis for going
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:53.280]  through
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:57.360]  ought to push us on the direction to turn this around and we do have the
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:58.880]  part to turn it around
[1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:00.040]  we have the power
[1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:01.480]  the president doesn't
[1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:05.760]  i don't know what in obama's mind obviously i'm not a mind reader i'm not
[1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:08.720]  a psychologist i don't want to put going on with the guy
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:09.920]  but i do know
[1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:12.360]  he's in a very very difficult position
[1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:16.120]  and even if he has the very best of intentions even if he wanted to do
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:18.640]  exactly what he promised to do in his campaign
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.520]  once he gets in that white house
[1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:22.640]  he gets the law is read to him
[1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:25.240]  he gets that somebody sit down and say hey
[1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:27.400]  remember what happened to martin luther king
[1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:30.080]  remember what happened to jack and robert kennedy
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:31.600]  remember remember remember
[1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:34.720]  then in clinton of course was physically assassinated but he had a
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:36.280]  character assassination
[1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:37.880]  and i think he had it
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:41.520]  the forecomings of one back in his first turn they clearly but the standard
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:45.360]  they clearly do that to weaken them and and make sure they're compromised and
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:48.280]  clearly obama's got a lot of skeletons that's why they like him
[1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:52.960]  he's also very graceful very intelligent and after bush it's like people want a
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:54.640]  president they're not ashamed of
[1:19:54.640 --> 1:19:56.280]  john perkins stay there

[1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:08.040]  we're talking to a gentleman recruited out of college
[1:24:08.040 --> 1:24:11.240]  the u.s government to work through private corporations to go in
[1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:15.560]  and facilitate the takeover of third world nations
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:20.200]  predominantly in latin america but it goes on worldwide
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:25.400]  by economic means john perkins i want to get more into what's currently
[1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:27.960]  happening and and and how this is just expanding and
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:30.920]  expanding as they gobble up the entire planet
[1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:36.520]  and uh leaf tyranny where liberty was and freedom was an economic freedom was
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:40.120]  but looking at the structure you know the cia's declassified they brag other
[1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:43.240]  governments do this mi6 does it you know other
[1:24:43.240 --> 1:24:46.680]  intelligence agencies do it but but nobody does it like the united states
[1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:49.800]  obviously the russians did it to some extent
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:54.600]  using money to control the nations but this program of going into third world
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:58.200]  countries paying off their leaders giving them loans at 25 30 interest
[1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:02.440]  where a billion bucks turns into 40 billion uh getting the countries to sign
[1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:06.360]  over all their infrastructure then the imf world bank documents where they
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:10.600]  turn the power and water off to cause a riot so then society really falls so
[1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:14.280]  the globalists can then buy up their stock markets i mean this is all on
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:18.120]  record and now they're clearly doing it not on a regional
[1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:22.680]  scale but on an international global scale uh
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:26.760]  i mean this is really a military system where they come in with the economics
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:30.280]  first and as you said back it up then militarily
[1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:33.800]  after the society collapses that creates the next crisis
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:37.640]  they need to bring in the physical control can you can you speak specifically
[1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:42.360]  to the imf riot well yeah i mean and what would be
[1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:46.040]  you know probably the best example of a clear example of what happened in
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:49.640]  coche bomba bolivia a few years ago when
[1:25:49.640 --> 1:25:54.200]  um the the imf decided that what it really wanted to do was take control of
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:56.680]  the water system down there bolivia couldn't pay off its
[1:25:56.680 --> 1:26:00.760]  debts uh and of course that the bolivian people at the time
[1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:03.480]  were saying we don't really owe these debts these debts were taken on by
[1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:07.000]  military dictatorship before our time we have any say in it
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:10.280]  and those guys are all gone now the banks shouldn't have allowed this to happen
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:14.280]  but in any case the imf went in and they dictated that the bolivia had to
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:18.920]  basically give its water company and coche bomba its third largest city to
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:21.560]  the bechtel corporation a u.s corporation
[1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:25.400]  bechtel went in and immediately increased all the prices of water some
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:28.280]  people had to pay four times what they've been paying before
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:31.560]  as the word got out that people couldn't even use rain water that they had to pay
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:34.440]  for that uh it was terrible so there was huge riot
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:38.040]  people were were couldn't we're dying of thirst
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:41.560]  uh poor people and they took to the streets and eventually
[1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:45.960]  uh they got their water system back and avo moralis then this became president
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:49.400]  of a very very much at the same time and and and
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:54.040]  bechtel kind of put its tail between its legs and left only because this
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:57.080]  enlightened president came in at the time
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:02.360]  um but we've seen that thing time and time and time and time again
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:06.440]  on all sorts of levels where where in order
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:10.520]  to uh a forgive a country's debt and we never really forgive it
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:14.200]  we just delay it usually increase the interest rates but in order to even make
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:17.160]  that happen we we force them to privatize their electric utility
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:21.480]  companies their water and sewage companies their prisons their schools
[1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:24.840]  their mines their resources their oil companies
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:28.840]  and sell it to uh american corporations or sometimes the european
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:32.600]  corporations time and time and time again and now of course
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:35.800]  it isn't interesting how we're almost seeing a reversal
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:40.040]  of that process in this country alex where we're in fact the private banks
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:43.720]  are in such dire trouble that the government is going in
[1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:48.120]  and bailing them out and it's stopping short of actually taking a real
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:51.720]  inequity position where it really has control over them
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:27:55.400]  but it's getting so deeply involved through these bailouts so it's really
[1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:59.640]  socialization of the corporatocracy of the people
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:02.600]  who run our big corporations the big corporations themselves
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:05.720]  we're socializing them and we've basically capitalized
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:08.760]  the poor people and all the failures in the country
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:14.680]  john i i see it as socializing the risk but privatizing the profit has been
[1:28:14.680 --> 1:28:18.280]  said many times where i really see this as a corporate
[1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:23.000]  takeover of the government i don't see it as a government
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:27.560]  takeover of the banks because it's clearly the the new york fed
[1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:32.040]  and other private central banks that are running the show globally
[1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:35.000]  they fear monger oh my god we're in this big crisis you know they use the
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:38.360]  derivatives and all the fiat currency and credit they made
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:42.760]  to buy up the world now the bubble's popping they're using that as a way to
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:45.480]  terrorize people into giving them even more power and they're
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:48.040]  announcing on the news a new bank of the world and
[1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:51.960]  that will be paying our taxes to it but but these are the bankers they're the
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:53.800]  experts they know how to run things
[1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:57.240]  yeah you're you're absolutely right no that this is government money that's
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:29:01.640]  going into bailout the bankers and and and other companies
[1:29:01.640 --> 1:29:05.000]  and yet the government's not not taking control it's it's the private sector
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:08.200]  that has the control but it's our money when i say government money i basically
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:12.040]  mean your money my money your listeners money our taxpayer money
[1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:15.160]  is going into bailout these guys that took big risk
[1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:20.360]  lost and now we're paying them off and they are continuing to have all the
[1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:24.840]  power the corporatocracy the private business man

[1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:15.960]  to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for
[1:32:15.960 --> 1:32:19.320]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:23.480]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all

[1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:21.400]  a little beans and we caught the bloody british in a town in new orleans
[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:25.560]  we fired our guns and we were fighting the same people back in the 1830s
[1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:28.920]  are today it's simple there's a class of people

[1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:42.920]  and these private families these private banking cartels and the allied
[1:33:42.920 --> 1:33:45.800]  corporations and military industrial complex under them
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:49.480]  they figured out how to engage in mass fraud how to create
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:53.800]  fiat currency and credit out of nothing and then get the world for it
[1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:57.320]  people will kill their grandma you know for a million bucks most people out

[1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:48.040]  those just hit that and just put in your email address
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:52.360]  and you'll be on my list and that the new book the working title is hoodwink

[1:34:55.880 --> 1:34:57.800]  today and how to change it something like that
[1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:01.640]  that title might change but we'll be sending out an email uh... a month or
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:04.440]  two before the book comes out and let everybody know where they can get it
[1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:07.720]  and and what the title will be being published by uh... random house
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:12.600]  broadway books uh... and uh... it's going to be covering all of these things
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:16.120]  you know john a lot of books have been written from similar
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:19.720]  perspectives or angles but obviously you're a great writer and
[1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:23.720]  uh... you have this amazing history but what why do you think from all the
[1:35:23.720 --> 1:35:27.160]  books out there that have been written literally hundreds and i know of
[1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:30.360]  exposing how this financial global oligarchy works
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:32.920]  why do you think yours became a number one bestseller and
[1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:36.920]  got so much attention well i think confessions became a bestseller
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:39.880]  because it you know it's it's a true story
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:44.040]  about a guy in the trenches it's not an academic treat us on this it's not
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:47.080]  speculation i only talk about things i really did
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:50.760]  i really experienced it and uh... it's it's my story and it's a
[1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:52.760]  i think it's a fun book to read because it's
[1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:55.800]  it's under our stories with a lot of conversations that a lot of people tell
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:59.320]  me it reads basically like a novel it's not a novel it's true i kept a lot of
[1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:01.720]  notes i know what i said in those conversations
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:04.760]  so i think it's it's it's kind of fun to read
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:08.360]  it's got uh... you know six drugs and rock and roll with it
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:12.520]  and it's not academic and yet it covers those the real
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:15.720]  truth behind the economics that went on and some of the economic principles
[1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:18.440]  behind it but i think in a way that's kind of readable
[1:36:18.440 --> 1:36:21.960]  the new book i'm writing now i'm very you know
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:25.640]  taken by how many books there are right now on what's done that the
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:29.080]  minutiae the detail of what's going on in the economy and how to fix it
[1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:31.480]  that's all necessary those are band-aids you know
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:34.520]  well how we're going to deal with aig how we're going to deal with the auto
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:38.520]  industry and and uh... bank of america etc but why not talk
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:41.000]  about the cause of it why not talk about who did it
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.800]  yeah well that's what i'm doing that's right that my book i think is very
[1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:47.400]  different because it's you know it's saying like everybody else is talking
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:50.680]  about triage the band-aids we need the triage we need the band-aid they're not
[1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:53.640]  undercutting this but the need for that at all but what i'm saying is
[1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:57.000]  we gotta get at that you know what caused the heart attack you can have a
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:00.040]  triple bypass but if you don't change your diet
[1:37:00.040 --> 1:37:03.080]  or whatever it was they caused the uj is gonna have another heart attack
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:06.280]  and that's what we're going through we can do all the triage we want but if we
[1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:09.640]  don't get at the root of the problem and change that
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:12.520]  then we're not going to get anywhere well john that's what i was about to say
[1:37:12.520 --> 1:37:16.520]  the so-called triage is giving the very criminals more power that would be
[1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:20.440]  like if you had cancer and they said how do we feed the cancer how do we make it
[1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:23.000]  grow faster how do we give it more power
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:27.320]  i mean that's not how you treat the cancer is is adding more carcinogens
[1:37:27.320 --> 1:37:31.400]  no no and that's exactly right and and and so we need to go
[1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:35.080]  way beyond that and that's what my book is about how did we get here what are the
[1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:39.560]  true causes of this and what do we have to do to change that of course
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:43.960]  the true causes are fairly philosophical and they're also the
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:47.880]  the way that we all live that the lies that we ourselves have
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:54.040]  bought into and accepted the icons that we have chosen to hold out as our
[1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:58.440]  heroes the whole form of consumerism the fact
[1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:01.880]  that we turn a blind eye to companies that are
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:05.080]  destroying rainforest in order to bring us cheap oil
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:08.280]  and so many other things like that and we really need to address those things
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:11.480]  and and and i think have fun in doing it
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:15.000]  you know i do not see this as honoris i see this as a time of
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:19.080]  tremendous enthusiastic passion for moving forward
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:22.360]  i think we're at a time in history alex it's like the industrial revolution or
[1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:26.440]  the agricultural revolution the time when city states became nations
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:29.320]  we're going through a truly transformational time
[1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:32.280]  and if we allow it to happen in this transformation
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:36.280]  a few people are going to become world rulers and they're well on the way to
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:40.280]  that now what i call the corporatocracy but we do not need to allow that to
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:43.160]  happen we can see this as a time when there will
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:47.000]  we can have a true turnaround but we really can start to
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:51.160]  honor and embrace the principles that were espoused by the founding fathers
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:54.680]  of this country of you know the right to life liberty in the pursuit of happiness
[1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:58.360]  government for and by the people we've moved a long way away from that in the
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:00.600]  last four or five decades in this country
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:04.040]  we need to and in fact at other times in our history too
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:08.200]  we need to move back into it now and go even further into it and look at it as a
[1:39:08.200 --> 1:39:10.520]  worldwide movement not just a movement
[1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:13.960]  as it's bracketed by the real grand in the canadian border in the Pacific and
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:16.600]  the Atlantic ocean this is a global movement
[1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:20.520]  well john perkins i agree with you when you say we're at a crossroads and and
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:24.120]  the technocrats the elites the big foundations
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:27.480]  the think tanks as you know say that and and they believe they're going to
[1:39:27.480 --> 1:39:30.600]  dominate the future they believe they can set up this world
[1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:33.640]  tyranny under this corporate globalist model
[1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:37.560]  where they socialize our wealth take it from us and give it to themselves
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:40.920]  to then buy off and control our governments and i want to talk about
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:44.760]  solutions of breaking free from this but but let's go
[1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:47.960]  back to the james bond parallel you know ean
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:51.960]  flaming os s world war two british intelligence
[1:39:51.960 --> 1:39:56.440]  writes these books and a lot of what's in those movies and books is true a lot of
[1:39:56.440 --> 1:39:58.760]  it isn't but when you take the gadgets out and the
[1:39:58.760 --> 1:40:04.040]  suave you know angle instead of james bond going out
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:07.480]  and helping and fighting specter and the bad guys james bond really works for
[1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:11.160]  specter and and so so you've got cia you've got
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:14.440]  mi6 and then above them is this global builder
[1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:18.200]  bird group trilateral commission you know the inner rings of the cfr who are
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:22.280]  these corporate players these managers and you were a mid-level
[1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:25.560]  you know you know kind of a captain out there
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:29.240]  you know uh engaging in the trench warfare
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:33.160]  uh on the ground to take over they know what they're doing they're making their
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:37.320]  move and so in reality james bond would actually be the bad guy he would go over
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:41.320]  to iran of 83 with kermit roosevelt from the us cia section chief
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:45.400]  staged terror attacks blaming on mohammed mozadek have him arrested
[1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:49.320]  behead the cabinet and bring in an oppressive police statement savoc
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:52.920]  which you cover in your book and i cover in my film terror storm
[1:40:52.920 --> 1:40:56.840]  history government sponsored terror and so now we see them setting up
[1:40:56.840 --> 1:41:02.440]  the savoc setting up this uh police state grid here in the united states
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:07.080]  uh i mean it's very very frightening to realize they're going for broke
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:10.120]  the establishment has committed and i see radio
[1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:16.040]  tv ads print ads domestic cia youth cores in the news saying they're going to
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:19.560]  spy on their neighbors i mean i have the headlines here today about
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:22.920]  you know children being told spy on their neighbors and their parents and how to be
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:26.520]  paid to do it i mean i want people to understand this is really happening
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:31.080]  uh so i kind of put out a lot of info there your comments on what i just said
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:35.080]  well yeah it's you know it's it's 1984 and we're just
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:39.320]  a few years late that's all but you know you talk about savoc and you talk about
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:42.440]  even the the ss if they're hitlers people
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:46.120]  uh it's coming up that we we know what we weren't any better
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:50.520]  and and probably still are and all this stuff about torture and and the
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:54.360]  degradation of the principles that we've always believed in
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:57.640]  um well you know what it's about to do that was worse than
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:01.960]  than what work that's coming out that we did uh to prisoners of war
[1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:05.880]  to people that we thought could give us information and now to have a
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:10.040]  former vice president uh continue to speak up and say
[1:42:10.040 --> 1:42:13.640]  it was the right thing is i mean what does that tell us
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:17.800]  alex it tells us that we've we've reached the system of
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:21.880]  where people are very very much trying to convince us
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:24.840]  that that is the system that we need to live under
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:29.800]  and we must resist this wholeheartedly if we don't resist their wholeheartedly
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:33.640]  we're no you know we're doing we're basically repeating what we for years
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:37.800]  blame that the german people for having accepted hitler and and
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:41.960]  and the the concentration camps the whole holocaust
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:44.920]  um we're finding ourselves in that same position now
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:48.840]  are we going to accept this or are we going to fight it well john that's my
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:52.120]  next point is that if you really study history what you're a learned man i'm
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:55.160]  sure you know about this it's now been declassified on record
[1:42:55.160 --> 1:42:59.640]  new york and british banks funded hitler early on
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:02.520]  thought he was a great guy because they wanted fascism
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:06.120]  and then later you know once he went totally wild turned against him
[1:43:06.120 --> 1:43:10.360]  and so again it's these banking cartels always funding every side
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:14.280]  playing nations off against each other funding both sides of the war
[1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:18.840]  and then in the end coming out on top of all the power i mean this is the same
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:22.760]  trick they play over and over again take what the banks did after world war one
[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:27.560]  with the Versailles sanctions on germany keeping them in a depression
[1:43:27.560 --> 1:43:30.440]  that was the atmosphere that allowed the rise of hitler
[1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:35.160]  that's the atmosphere that keeps the third world under dictatorships today
[1:43:35.160 --> 1:43:38.760]  and you read the royal commission on population 44 to
[1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:43.000]  49 put up with the british government they cold-bloodedly admit they're doing
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:46.840]  all of this to create destabilization so they can control things
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:50.200]  i mean this is really order out of chaos yeah
[1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:54.680]  yeah and and and here we go again and not only that alex but
[1:43:54.680 --> 1:43:59.800]  a you know when i went to a business school back in the 60s i had professors
[1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:03.480]  uh... that would tell me we'll never have another great depression because we've
[1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:06.760]  set rules and regulations in place that will not allow that to happen again and
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:10.120]  i think that was true at the time of glass deagle was
[1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:14.600]  you know one of the preeminent acts and and and regulations against
[1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:19.960]  users to interest rates but it's been set time since i graduated from college
[1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:24.520]  beginning in the 80s under reagan and continuing to clinton everybody else
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:27.800]  um... we continually hacked away at those rules
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:30.680]  so we reached the point where there was no more glass deagle that separated
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:33.720]  commercial banks from investment banks and insurance companies
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:38.200]  and the use of real laws were all done away with so today there's some of these
[1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:42.520]  payday check people are charging as much as eight hundred percent interest rates
[1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:45.800]  and banks and credit cards are charging in the 30s
[1:44:45.800 --> 1:44:49.960]  um... that's outrageous and i was told when i was in business school that would
[1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:53.480]  never happen again and that protected us from the from another depression and i
[1:44:53.480 --> 1:44:57.320]  think it probably did but we whittled away at all these things
[1:44:57.320 --> 1:45:02.200]  we made icons and heroes out of people like donald trump and jack welch of g
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:06.520]  who who made a who bragged about the fact that they fired people
[1:45:06.520 --> 1:45:11.240]  uh... and and at the same time gave themselves huge increases in salaries
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:15.160]  welch got rid of roughly a quarter of his employees at gd and gave himself huge
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:19.800]  bonuses uh... you know when trump fires people on tv and makes a big scene out
[1:45:19.800 --> 1:45:20.520]  of it
[1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:25.640]  these became our icons our heroes and we got rid of regulation and we took on
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:30.680]  huge huge amounts of death and we the consumer turned a blind eye to the
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:33.560]  isn't this i mean exactly but in this gladiatorial
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:36.920]  where they show people being fired and we all kind of join in
[1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:40.680]  there in the arena but next week we're going to be in the arena and our friends
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:43.960]  are going to be laughing at us in the cheap seats to interrupt you because i
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:46.760]  uh... in the limited time and you're making so many great points
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:50.120]  i want to go back here to how they recruited you
[1:45:50.120 --> 1:45:54.120]  because they're recruiting now in the high schools the colleges for domestic
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:57.080]  uh... spies and and and running all the same operations
[1:45:57.080 --> 1:45:59.720]  i haven't been involved in this at the level you've been in
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:03.560]  but just being a talk show host back when i was only on a few radio stations
[1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:07.720]  back in like ninety seven ninety eight i got approached by big corporate heads
[1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:10.680]  openly saying yeah the new world order is real you might as well just go ahead
[1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:11.640]  and join us
[1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:14.920]  you'll get millions of dollars come on the loser public doesn't want your help
[1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:17.880]  you know kind of that mindset of your part of the elite to and of course i knew
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:20.200]  that wasn't the case they were trying to sell me
[1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:24.920]  and then since then i've had him try to send women after me with handlers
[1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:29.320]  i've been in new york and had literal russian spies there trying to put you
[1:46:29.320 --> 1:46:33.880]  know number ten blondes on me and it's not that alex jones is special
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:37.640]  it's that there are really spies and intelligence people going all over the
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:42.120]  place operating all the time and the general public just doesn't know this
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:45.560]  they don't understand this can you explain to them how big these armies
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:49.160]  of of of not just cia and nsa and defense intelligence
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:52.760]  but all the allied corporate groups that are operating can you explain because
[1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:56.040]  you were inside that how big this really is
[1:46:56.040 --> 1:46:59.160]  well as you found out it's a very seductive system and they figure out what
[1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:02.600]  your weakness is which i think in your it may sound to me alex like you're a
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:05.960]  weakness for number ten blondes but it didn't work
[1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:09.800]  the point is it didn't work yeah but some place along the line
[1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:13.400]  they identified as a potential weakness for you and you've overcome it
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:18.280]  good for you good for you but they but i mean that that's what that's true they
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:22.760]  they hone in on these things i talk in in in the in my the last book i did
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:25.480]  and not not the one that's coming out but the one right after confessions
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:28.040]  that call secret history of the american empire about this
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:32.440]  with this brazilian woman while i was in brazil who who could get proposed as a
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:36.200]  as a journalist and about what she was really doing was offering
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:39.480]  great sex to me if uh if i came around i mean that's
[1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:44.200]  that's that's typical and there's so many ways of bringing you around and then
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:49.480]  blackmailing you uh or offering big bribes i i talk in the books about how i
[1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:52.760]  took a pretty big bribe at one time of money because also my life is being
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:56.120]  threatened not to write books yes this happened
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:47:59.640]  it happens all the time it's a big part of the system and alex
[1:47:59.640 --> 1:48:03.320]  you are important that's where they're coming after you you're reaching people
[1:48:03.320 --> 1:48:06.920]  anybody who's reaching people is important because they recognize
[1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:10.840]  that public opinion is where it's all at you know what the the the marketplace
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:13.880]  is democratic if we choose to make it but this is the
[1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:18.120]  good news that these big corporations are dependent on us
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:23.960]  uh if you know they cannot exist if we don't buy the goods and services or if
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:26.840]  our tax money doesn't buy the goods and services
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:30.280]  and we've we've won so many battles in the past you know we got rid of a
[1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:33.400]  apartheid in south africa basically through the marketplace
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:36.920]  we got corporations to clean up terribly polluted rivers in this country get
[1:48:36.920 --> 1:48:40.360]  rid of aerosol cans we're destroying the ozone layer open the doors wider to
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:44.920]  women and minorities get rid of trans fats and food to on and on
[1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:50.360]  because just a few of us if we if if if if a small number of us never again
[1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:53.960]  buys from nike and we write a lot and every one of us writes an email to
[1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:57.400]  nike and says we're not buying from you because you have sweatshops
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:01.000]  uh and we buy from patagonia and send them an email and say we are buying from
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.800]  you because you don't have sweatshops then nike is either going to have to
[1:49:03.800 --> 1:49:07.640]  fold or turn it sweatshops into legitimate factories
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:10.120]  well here's another example john and you're right
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:13.720]  ten years ago i'd go grocery shopping and couldn't find organic food
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:17.400]  now because the people demanded it it created a market
[1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:21.400]  now about half the food in austin stores is organic and it's starting to push
[1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:24.520]  out the other uh you know a bad gmo stuff so the
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:29.720]  government's trying to pass a law so they can deceptively label things but
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:33.640]  again another example of if we just vote with our dollars and believe we have
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:37.640]  power there's nothing we can't change we just gotta take our destiny
[1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:40.760]  exactly we have tremendous power in that regard
[1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:45.160]  europe has essentially gotten rid of gmo even the big companies that use gmo
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:48.440]  products in this country like keloch and crafts and companies like that
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:51.560]  are taking out of the things they're selling in europe because europe demanded
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:55.080]  that we could do the same thing yes there will be resistance and yes the
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:49:58.040]  government will try to see us but we don't need to let that happen
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:02.200]  we really have tremendous power what we need to do is exercise it more and
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:06.120]  realize that our vote in the marketplace is extremely important
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:09.080]  i'm not going to say it's more important or less important than our boat
[1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:13.320]  vote in the polling booth but it's just as important it's important they're
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:16.360]  both important we need to vote every time we shop
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:19.560]  or choose not to shop and we need to let those companies
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:23.240]  know why we're not buying from them or why we are buying from them
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:27.000]  and that will turn things around exactly there's more of us than there are the
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.960]  elite i mean i had roth cop on again former head of the kitchens group who
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:32.920]  wrote this book super class and there he was in the washington post bragging
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:36.360]  we're setting up world government up for and by the elites
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:39.640]  and i had him on i said why'd you come on oh we know who you are we just want to
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:42.040]  you know come on the show and let everybody know that you know we're
[1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:45.640]  doing this for your own good but but he admitted there's
[1:50:45.640 --> 1:50:49.640]  6 000 super class in the world and if we didn't go along with them there's no
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:52.360]  way they could get away with this final segment with john perkins straight

[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:20.280]  from brazil and other places john perkins one area we didn't get into
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:22.920]  today but you've got to go in about ten minutes
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:26.280]  uh is what the jackals do what the hitmen do
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:30.360]  you were the guy trying to buy them off you were the slick corporate operator
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:34.360]  explain what came next if folks didn't go along
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:38.200]  well yeah i for example in ecuador with honey rolled out and in panama with all
[1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:41.080]  my torrijos i couldn't bring those guys around they wouldn't take these big
[1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:44.200]  rob loans they wouldn't corrupt themselves in their country
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:49.320]  uh and so i was very aware that there'd be tremendous pressure placed upon them
[1:55:49.320 --> 1:55:52.600]  and in some cases we overthrow governments like we did in with most of
[1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:57.240]  the deck in iran and with arbons and watamala in other places we assassinate
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:56:01.000]  the leaders as we did with the yende in chili and that's what happened to both
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:04.520]  rollos at ecuador and to rehost the panama because i couldn't bring them
[1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:07.080]  around i like both of these men immensely i was particularly close to
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:10.600]  torrijos really really liked the guy uh they were both
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:15.320]  assassinated is that what started waking you up is that you
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:17.800]  knew these guys really cared about their people
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:20.520]  whether you agree with their politics or not and you were seeing them
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:23.160]  you know you know one week you're having drinks with them and a week later
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:27.000]  they're dead yeah i began to get the really get the idea about
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:31.880]  night late 1978 early 1979 i was i was called to washington a meeting at the
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:35.560]  army and navy club with some retired admiral and generals
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:39.560]  uh and and read the riot act on a on an african president that they want to
[1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:42.200]  meet a corrupt and if i couldn't do that they were going to take him out and it
[1:56:42.200 --> 1:56:46.200]  became very very clear to me up until that point i'd been in an economic
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:50.440]  hitman for about nine years and you know like everybody else
[1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:54.360]  i'd heard i figured that the cia was involved in the in the end day and most
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:57.720]  of deck but it was all intellectual to me and i would use it sometimes in
[1:56:57.720 --> 1:57:00.600]  arguments of these presidents or remember what happened to most of deck
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:05.080]  remember what happened to our men's but you know i i i didn't have any personal
[1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:08.920]  involvement and suddenly i'm in these meetings in washington with these
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:12.120]  generals and admirals and and i'm hearing this stuff
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:15.560]  and then i'm beginning to see the tremendous pressure that rolled those
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:19.640]  that ecuador and and torrijos the pan maranda and then they get assassinated
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:22.680]  and i know there's no denying anymore and that's when i get the hell out
[1:57:22.680 --> 1:57:26.200]  immediately i quit on the day's notice because it suddenly
[1:57:26.200 --> 1:57:30.760]  i really really got it and it made me absolutely sick and miserable and i
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:34.360]  hated myself and and had to get out and then
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:37.720]  a lot of good old boys say yeah we're going around killing people to take over
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:41.400]  now they're doing it in america with north com now they're taking over
[1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:44.600]  what about government sponsored terror you know we know they've done that many
[1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:48.120]  times uh the tong can incident the liberty and others
[1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:51.240]  nine eleven other events uh came out cyhurst reported
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:54.360]  cheney wanted to attack our own ships but it got vetoed
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:57:57.960]  uh what about government sponsored terror i mean these generals are getting
[1:57:57.960 --> 1:58:01.000]  pretty ruthless well look at the general that has just been given
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:04.120]  command of afghanistan i guess they haven't been approved yet but the one
[1:58:04.120 --> 1:58:08.120]  that's been proposed from a special forces special operations
[1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:12.360]  uh we know he's he's he's on record of having been involved in the torture in
[1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:15.800]  these places and also having given the command to have
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:19.720]  the people around the world assassinated what we call terrorist
[1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:23.480]  assassinated i mean there's no justification for that
[1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:26.920]  you know alex this whole little business of terrorism is an interesting
[1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:31.240]  word it's not an ism there's no relationship between the terrorists

[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:31.880]  work and so uh i i i don't know how much time do i have on my car
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:35.640]  not a lot solomon do you have a question or a comment yes i have a question i'm
[2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:40.600]  familiar with the work of mr john perkins what i have seen in john perkins
[2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:44.680]  like i have seen in chip berlet and and in chamber johnson and nom john
[2:01:44.680 --> 2:01:49.400]  schi and how we're seeing is that the when they are putting it in the spot and
[2:01:49.400 --> 2:01:54.360]  they are in some particular a very big media outlet
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:58.040]  they don't know they are not always talking about 911
[2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:03.080]  i don't know why but they keep for themselves and they know that the 911
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:07.720]  is a direct relation with with our government and our military and if they
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:10.680]  have already talked about that clearly and
[2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:14.760]  help it to open up the mind of all the people in the united states
[2:02:14.760 --> 2:02:20.040]  which whom i am a citizen probably the the the result will be different so i
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:23.240]  don't know why i still expect to know why
[2:02:23.240 --> 2:02:28.040]  the people like him and like others okay solemn solemn i
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:30.440]  solemn i understand your question i want to be able to
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:33.400]  get a response you know john perkins was just talking about government staging
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:36.680]  events but i don't ever blame people who politically
[2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:39.720]  don't go as far as i do or don't totally agree with me
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:43.160]  as long as they're on the side of the good guys exposing corruption
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:47.080]  you know we should focus on the establishment who's totally against us
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:49.560]  instead of always fighting with each other about
[2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:52.680]  who agrees with this or who agrees with that i don't know what john's
[2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:55.400]  position is on 9-11 being an inside job or not
[2:02:55.400 --> 2:03:00.520]  john perkins well uh... you know what i but my standard answer to that is
[2:03:00.520 --> 2:03:04.280]  i don't have any inside information and my i write books based on my own
[2:03:04.280 --> 2:03:07.320]  personal experience i like to write about things i know i know exactly the
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:11.080]  role dose of equity was assassinated i know that torrijos was assassinated i
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:15.400]  was there now 9-11 i don't i don't have any inside information
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:19.080]  but what i will say and i always say is it think i can't i have an
[2:03:19.080 --> 2:03:22.440]  extremely difficult time believing that a guy with a walkie talking from a
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:26.040]  cave in the Himalayas executed this by himself
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:30.120]  i don't understand why as the pentagon had a hole blown in it and no
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:34.040]  head rolls no generals lost their jobs note no videos ever been produced to
[2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:37.240]  show anything i think it's extremely suspect
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:40.600]  i can't you know it's really hard to believe that anything like that happened
[2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:45.320]  without inside help but i can't say that from a position of having any personal
[2:03:45.320 --> 2:03:50.040]  knowledge that's why i absolutely you choose to go off what you know and you
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:53.160]  went to the big military and and and you know you've named the generals and
[2:03:53.160 --> 2:03:56.600]  people in your book and and and you've had a lot of courage we appreciate you

[2:08:25.960 --> 2:08:29.080]  hopefully he'll come back in the next few months because this is economic
[2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:33.560]  prize this is so serious we went to break earlier i never asked that question
[2:08:33.560 --> 2:08:36.440]  or i never got the answer to it so in closing
[2:08:36.440 --> 2:08:40.040]  answer the fellas question about all their economic hitmen in iraq and iran
[2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:48.360]  and then uh the final point uh is uh you know do we in your opinion
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:54.040]  uh have a chance to beat these people and first question lots of economic hitmen
[2:08:54.040 --> 2:08:59.240]  and jackals in iraq iran uh afghanistan pakistan i know some of them i'm
[2:08:59.240 --> 2:09:02.600]  the communication with some of them but staff
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:05.480]  assassins and economic hitmen both doing it
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:09.400]  doing doing our dirty work over there um and
[2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:13.800]  yes i think we have an incredibly good chance of getting rid of this to turn
[2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:16.440]  this whole thing around alex that's that's what my new book coming out in
[2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:19.800]  november is about and again if you go to john perkins dot org
[2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:23.160]  and sign up for my newsletter i will be announcing the time of that book the
[2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:27.080]  working title is hoodwinked and it really gets into this but i think we are at a
[2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:29.800]  threshold and in human history right now
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:34.280]  where things are in such entropy that we're going to come out of this
[2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:38.520]  either under a terrible dictatorship uh the the
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:43.320]  popular the most global dictatorship ever uh in our history or
[2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:47.160]  we're going to come out on top and and i'm fighting for us coming out on top
[2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:50.840]  and i think we all need to get in there together we have tremendous power of
[2:09:50.840 --> 2:09:55.240]  as individuals perhaps more now than ever because in essence this new empire
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:09:58.360]  is being created through economics through the way we shop through the way
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:02.360]  we live through the people we watch on television through the messages we
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:06.440]  listen to on radio and television there's a classic struggle going on right
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:09.960]  so it's insidious that it's not an open military threat
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:12.920]  and and that's a strong suit but it's also it's achilles heel
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:16.680]  because we have inherent power in the system so you're saying you believe
[2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:19.800]  they are over playing their hand and we've got a good chance on
[2:10:19.800 --> 2:10:23.640]  bringing this dragon down i think they have overplayed their hand their hand
[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:26.680]  i mean that's what you know that there's a huge revolution going on in
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:29.480]  latin america 10 countries representing more than 80 percent of the
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:31.960]  population of south america have voted in
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:35.160]  very left-leaning liberal progressive whatever you want to call it president
[2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:39.720]  for the saying no to this and i think in our last election when we elected obama
[2:10:39.720 --> 2:10:43.240]  we said no whether obama is going to go along with that or not another question
[2:10:43.240 --> 2:10:46.200]  but i think that's the symbolism that's the message it was sent
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:49.320]  people are waking up they woke up big time in latin america
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:53.160]  they're waiting in the middle east and i think we've woken up here but we need to
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:56.600]  keep waking up wider and wider and taking more action and not
[2:10:56.600 --> 2:10:58.680]  expect that obama is going to do it for us
[2:10:58.680 --> 2:11:02.680]  we have to do it you know we didn't we didn't end slavery in this country
[2:11:02.680 --> 2:11:05.320]  because abraham lincoln found himself in the white house
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:09.000]  we pushed and pushed and we elected a man who we knew was going to slavery
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:12.360]  women didn't get the right to vote because woodrow wilson was for women's
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:15.960]  suffrage he wasn't after he was elected the women went out in the streets
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:18.920]  everywhere that man went he was followed by women pickets
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:23.320]  with huge signs it said why should we fight for democracy in world war one
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:27.240]  and in europe when when half of our own country doesn't have the right to vote
[2:11:27.240 --> 2:11:30.440]  we didn't get out of vietnam because richard nixon was anti-war
[2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:33.800]  he wasn't we got out of it because the people demanded it of course we were
[2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:37.240]  also losing the war like we are in in in the middle east today
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:40.520]  but the people demanded that we took to the streets we've got a demanded now
[2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:43.800]  but today it's easier because in a way we can demand it
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:46.920]  by the way we shop as much as anything as you pointed out
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:50.840]  we have tremendous control and for far too long
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:53.960]  we've let these people get away with convincing us that what we really want
[2:11:53.960 --> 2:11:56.920]  is the cheapest tennis shoes and t-shirts even though
[2:11:56.920 --> 2:12:00.920]  slaves are making them and it destroys our industry it destroys us it's a gun
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:03.720]  that shoots both ways john perkins i'm going to let you go as you got another
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:06.920]  interview coming up i will talk to you again very very soon
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:09.480]  thank you so much the website is john perkins dot
[2:12:09.480 --> 2:12:13.080]  or g and uh... the book is confessions of an economic hitman
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:16.120]  uh... john perkins the new book working title hoodwink coming out in
[2:12:16.120 --> 2:12:18.360]  november we'll talk to you soon sir
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:21.000]  i like your beer beautiful keep it be great work
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:24.200]  thank you you are too my friend good to good to have you on we appreciate your
[2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:28.200]  courage there goes john perkins ladies and gentlemen i'm sorry i didn't get to
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:32.280]  joe's call directly for him but he had to go but he said he'd like to come back
[2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:35.160]  up for a longer interview in the near future
[2:12:35.160 --> 2:12:40.360]  so we will uh... get that done as a p
[2:12:40.360 --> 2:12:42.920]  okay let's go ahead and go to your calls you know i haven't taken enough calls
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:45.640]  lately you know we could take thousands of calls on the show
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:48.280]  literally we can give each caller like ten seconds take a thousand calls in four
[2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:53.880]  hours uh... but i don't do that as i got so much news so much info but i
[2:12:53.880 --> 2:12:57.240]  the other big problem taking calls is callers always bring up such incredible
[2:12:57.240 --> 2:13:01.480]  angles and stories and things that i'll go on some rant or dissertation or they
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:04.840]  will that we never get to everybody and so folks
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:07.560]  you know get dissuaded from calling in we're taking your calls right now i'm
[2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:10.200]  giving each caller about a minute and a half so we can talk to everybody
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:13.160]  during the sour them are getting a report from bill deberg coming up next
[2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:16.040]  hour what all happened to skelton this weekend
[2:13:16.040 --> 2:13:18.280]  that's top news story in the london guardian right now
[2:13:18.280 --> 2:13:22.040]  uh... let's go ahead and talk to joe in texas joe you're on the air go ahead
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:22.920]  welcome
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:27.720]  hi thanks i have two quotes for you first one from
[2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:32.040]  george washington seventeen ninety six
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:36.280]  towards the preservation of your government it is requisite
[2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:41.880]  that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles
[2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:46.680]  however species the pretext one method of assault
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:53.080]  may be to affect in the form of the constitution alterations
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:56.280]  which will impair the energy of the system
[2:13:56.280 --> 2:14:02.600]  and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown
[2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:07.240]  which is exactly what i think it's been going on for years here
[2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:12.920]  um... there is yeah they act like the bill arrives in constitution still there
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:15.640]  but really they use it as a door matter toilet paper
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:18.680]  and we've got this incredible tyranny of respect because there's this illusion
[2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:22.760]  of freedom we're going along with it but now that illusion starting to melt
[2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:25.720]  and people are seeing the tyranny for what it is but they don't have
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:28.440]  enough respect for themselves to believe they can fight back against it
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:32.840]  we have to get people to rediscover the respect for themselves they have and
[2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:36.760]  realize you're only alive once and your destiny is to fight tyranny
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:40.680]  and here's the answer to that question there is
[2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:47.240]  an organization called national center for constitutional studies
[2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:55.160]  the site is nccs.net they have a course
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:59.320]  in the 28 principles of the constitution
[2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:03.160]  on dvd which i have got
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:10.280]  and i have got 12 people who are coming to my house to watch this thing
[2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:16.520]  it is transformational because i think a lot of people
[2:15:16.520 --> 2:15:20.520]  know there's something wrong but don't exactly know what it is
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:25.480]  and this will give you the information and the background and
[2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:30.120]  in order to stand up for what's right what you know is right but you don't
[2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:33.640]  exactly know how to say it
[2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:38.920]  all right thank you so much i appreciate your call we have breaking news
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:43.160]  here and i the the reason this upsets me is i heard
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:46.520]  this already last week from someone i know in the military but they wouldn't
[2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:49.160]  come on air kind of like my cousin came to my door five
[2:15:49.160 --> 2:15:53.800]  years ago and he's an officer and he said yeah we got called down to
[2:15:53.800 --> 2:15:58.280]  fort sam houston for an officer meeting there were 200 of us
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:02.840]  or so in the in the auditorium who were told it was classified
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:05.080]  and that everybody was going to be all the officers were going to be getting
[2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:08.840]  chips within two years then i've seen him at family events once twice a year
[2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:11.080]  now and he won't talk to me about it he says i'm not going to talk to you about
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:13.400]  it i don't know you know i didn't tell you that
[2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:17.640]  he came to my house to tell me this five years ago and then now won't talk to me
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:23.480]  about it and uh this
[2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:27.080]  you know how huge this is get this to paul watson
[2:16:27.080 --> 2:16:30.840]  now in fact jenesis call paul watson see i said i take calls
[2:16:30.840 --> 2:16:34.760]  stuff breaks it didn't happen um my god ladies and gentlemen they have bills
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:37.880]  introduced to completely ban any guns they want at will
[2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:40.520]  i'll give you the bill numbers coming up they have things when they put you on a
[2:16:40.520 --> 2:16:45.560]  secret list you can't own guns in fact i i have both of those bills right here
[2:16:45.560 --> 2:16:51.000]  it's um hr 2159 where they list you as a terrorist you can't own guns
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:54.680]  here's another one bill in congress would ban gun ownership at will
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:17:01.080]  that is uh give you the bill number on that hr 2401
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:04.520]  and then i actually printed off the other one because i've been covering these
[2:17:04.520 --> 2:17:08.040]  over the last few days and i wanted to give people
[2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:14.440]  all of it into tail this is rolling it daily hr 1022 congress plan to let ag
[2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:18.840]  ban guns at will this allows them to ban any guns they want it will blank check
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:25.320]  that's hr 1022 by new york uh democrat carillon mccarthy god
[2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:29.000]  this other one uh is the uh terrorist act
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:35.640]  and uh that's uh hr 2159 which allows them anybody on a list can't own guns
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:37.960]  even if you're not convicted of anything and then the other bills is if you
[2:17:37.960 --> 2:17:42.680]  want to know fly list no gun that's uh

[2:24:17.080 --> 2:24:20.440]  our analysis you know as we follow this roadmap of the new world order we know
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:24.360]  the direction they're going in but as things develop and time unfolds and
[2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:26.760]  as hindsight comes in with more of what they've done in the past
[2:24:26.760 --> 2:24:31.480]  we get a clearer picture this is one of those this is an absolute mega
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:35.000]  emergency i have sent this to paul watson this is one of
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:39.160]  those things also that i'd already knew about but couldn't triple confirm
[2:24:39.160 --> 2:24:43.240]  so it's one of the things i just move on just like i have this fbi training video
[2:24:43.240 --> 2:24:47.160]  that'll make the myac thing look tame and comparison i've been too busy for two
[2:24:47.160 --> 2:24:50.600]  weeks to even get it up and i'm not whining i'm just
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:54.200]  telling you folks it almost just makes me fluster and you know get out of
[2:24:54.200 --> 2:24:57.880]  control here on air because the evidence of total tyranny world
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:02.120]  government admitted is just pouring in my beloved republic that my children
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:06.120]  live in that my family has been here for you know since the mayflower and founding
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:09.560]  texas and i love america and it's being flushed down the toilet by a
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:14.040]  bunch of offshore banks and they're making all the troops now
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:18.920]  in the army report in their private lives uh... you know
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:22.200]  and they're now doing this phased in their testing and even those that are
[2:25:22.200 --> 2:25:25.240]  off-duty or those that are on leave or those that have their own separate
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:29.800]  homes to list all their firearms and make model and serial number
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:33.880]  i mean that's high treason there's no i mean folks it's so evil
[2:25:33.880 --> 2:25:36.920]  and and most the veterans i know can't buy guns now
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:39.640]  they've already implemented all of this and uh...
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:42.440]  clinton banned eighty six thousand vets from owning guns for no reason remember
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:46.600]  when he left but it only continued and uh... you know the no-fly list for
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:50.360]  veterans that is the no-owned guns under the no-fly list is already in place
[2:25:50.360 --> 2:25:52.680]  i'm gonna break that down and go back to your calls but
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:56.920]  paul watson i just emailed you at your uh...
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:01.480]  dj account all active duty members heads up
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:06.600]  and this just came in uh... minutes ago and uh... about thirty minutes ago and
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:10.840]  we did some checking on it and uh... confirmed that this is the
[2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:14.600]  battalion and that this went out and just like people were in denial about the
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:18.520]  myack of the dhs reporter all the other reports we've broken
[2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:21.400]  or the secret army reports how they're spying on us and later it comes out
[2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:25.400]  mainstream news this is confirmed i want to read this to you watson
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:28.360]  and i want a story a blurb about this now and then beef it
[2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:31.400]  doing a great job what watson's my go-to guy gentlemen
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:34.440]  i am with the eleventh be currently assigned to fort campbell
[2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:38.760]  i live off post with my firearms which i don't bring on post for any reason
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:42.120]  a very frightening thing happened at work yesterday i was ordered to fill out
[2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:45.880]  a list containing my farm information this includes make model caliber and
[2:26:45.880 --> 2:26:48.920]  serial number this is in his private life shouldn't do that
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:52.120]  of of all firearms i currently possess
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:55.640]  in addition i was also required to list registration
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:26:57.960]  information location of all weapons individually
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:27:01.160]  and information regarding any ccw permits i possess
[2:27:01.160 --> 2:27:04.440]  if you are like me than the people uh... you work with
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:08.680]  know you have firearms so i had to list at least one
[2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:12.040]  i tried to talk to my first sergeant is normally approachable through proper
[2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:15.240]  channels to find out what this is for and i was basically told
[2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:19.000]  just put your info on the form i don't know how high this goes but i'm hearing
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:22.120]  that this is going on in other units at fort campbell as well
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:25.320]  see i heard this was going on in austin you put two and two together where i
[2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:29.640]  heard it from but i'm just going to leave it at that
[2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:33.000]  camp mayberry okay it's no secret it just seems
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:36.440]  a little coincidental to me that within 90 days
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:39.320]  the most anti-firing president in history is inaugurated
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:42.200]  some of the nastiest anti-firing laws are put on the table in washington
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:47.000]  and the army comes around wanting what amounts to registration of all firearms
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:50.200]  even if they are off post it doesn't provide any real information
[2:27:50.200 --> 2:27:53.320]  or purposes as to why because it's really happening
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:57.640]  they stole 14.8 trillion in seven months they're going for a broke
[2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:01.800]  this is it dumbasses there's no more time to screw around
[2:28:01.800 --> 2:28:06.200]  get yourselves in gear police that serve this system and realize the side who's
[2:28:06.200 --> 2:28:10.520]  side you're on cut all the crap i saw all these police
[2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:13.720]  videos from around the country indiana california name
[2:28:13.720 --> 2:28:16.760]  where cops run up and boot kick suspects in the head
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:20.520]  when the guys have got their hands out and the police defend it and say
[2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:24.280]  they were just positioning his head they kick the head bloods flung you know
[2:28:24.280 --> 2:28:27.880]  the just boom total power guys knocked out they go
[2:28:27.880 --> 2:28:31.160]  we that in the physical assault can just kill somebody
[2:28:31.160 --> 2:28:35.400]  we teach them to do that it's head positioning in case he might have tried
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:38.200]  to spit of course he said oh he spit then later
[2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:41.240]  it was on the video he the guy that spit he's like i'm i'm submitting
[2:28:41.240 --> 2:28:44.520]  they kick him in the head do high fives and then the cops come out and defend

[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:42.360]  happening paul this is so unconstitutional so criminal paul watchin
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:46.200]  hello like yeah the what the one um
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:52.600]  no fly no buy list that one's got very little attention in the media
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:57.080]  from what i can tell today all the media are talking about
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:38:02.600]  is this amendment that's just passed the senate to be approved in the house
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:08.520]  which allows people to carry firearms in national parks so all the attention
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:12.520]  going on that whereas there's legislation in the
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:17.000]  work that was virtually eliminate second amendment
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:20.520]  rights for anyone who the government declared to be a
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:23.560]  terrorist which as we know according to their own
[2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:29.320]  dhs lexicon document is basically about half of the u.s population at least
[2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:33.240]  that's right and we we properly called it
[2:38:33.240 --> 2:38:36.440]  that the supreme court ruling said oh yeah you can own firearms
[2:38:36.440 --> 2:38:40.280]  uh you have a second right but but we have a right under law to ban them
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:43.800]  and then now courts have been ruling with that interpretation
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:47.880]  and so it's a smoke screen yeah you got a right a right to hand them into us
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:51.640]  and i mean look at this flotilla of bills and then they write national news
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:57.240]  stories attacking us by name and others saying we're crazy liars that make up
[2:38:57.240 --> 2:39:01.400]  that obama's introduced gun bills when all the top senators and house members
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:04.440]  are doing it as chief of staff is flogging the bills
[2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:08.360]  through congress i mean you got the white house arm twisting for gun control
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:11.800]  the worst ever seen but it's not just gun control saying
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:15.480]  you're secretly put on list this is how this is going to control how we travel
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:18.280]  where we go we do it's not just for gun owners
[2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:21.560]  the secret list about where you can fly what you can do they're saying if you
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:24.760]  have bad credit you won't be able to get jobs anywhere it's already happening
[2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:27.800]  uh they're saying you won't be able to be on a no-fly list for bad credit
[2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:32.280]  this is control poll i need you to get a story out immediately
[2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:35.320]  uh veterans having their guns registered secretly
[2:39:35.320 --> 2:39:38.680]  or veterans having their guns registered in violation they're making them do it
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:43.480]  in their own private homes i mean this is outrageous crap
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:47.080]  and i am sick of it it's like obama coming out saying we'll just make the
[2:39:47.080 --> 2:39:50.360]  veterans pay for their own health care people couldn't believe it until we had
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:54.360]  the head of the va on admitting it i mean this is really i mean the head of

[2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:25.960]  thousands of calls they got over 10 000 calls i talked to
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:29.240]  somebody i know separately that works at youtube high level but they can't come
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:33.000]  on record we did get emails from them saying why
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:37.800]  don't you guys file a federal uh uh filing
[2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:41.560]  challenging these because it does look like these may be fake
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:44.920]  so last week with day that runs the channel
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:51.160]  we filed uh in federal court that's the level we had to go to is swear in
[2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:55.640]  federal court that it was fake that was wrong and it did turn out that there
[2:42:55.640 --> 2:42:58.920]  were fake copyright notices and now the court's looking into who
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:03.160]  filed them uh but you know this is and and and folks i don't think it's going to
[2:43:03.160 --> 2:43:06.120]  be up there too long again they'll just file more criminal deals
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:10.520]  i mean that's what these people do so we need an evacuation of the alex jones
[2:43:10.520 --> 2:43:14.120]  channel immediately there was a lot of subscribers dropped it was at 40 000
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:17.720]  now it's 37 000 very bizarre so but let's make it even
[2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:20.680]  bigger everybody should subscribe to it while it's still there
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:26.280]  channel views 2 975 000 uh i counted up just what it was getting the last week
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:29.560]  2 million a million a week before that was well over 30 million views of the
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:31.800]  channel that's just one channel but the point is
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:34.520]  was the censorship it's a very important channel
[2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:40.120]  uh so i want folks to uh to get this out to everybody
[2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:43.480]  i want people to go and evacuate the 2000 plus videos
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:46.760]  it was a great loss when it was shut down we couldn't get the videos off of it
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:49.560]  because you know they're uploaded they're not on your computer and it would
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:52.920]  take it took you over a year per day working every day just to upload
[2:43:52.920 --> 2:43:57.480]  2200 something videos we have to evacuate everything
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:00.760]  off of the alex jones channel as if they're going to hit it again
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:04.840]  we've been having hack attacks death threats everything short of monkey
[2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:09.240]  swinging from chandeliers in here and so this kind of a bunch of other channels
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:12.600]  have been erased and deleted with our stuff they're attacking everywhere
[2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:16.440]  so i wouldn't count on that site being there very long
[2:44:16.440 --> 2:44:21.000]  this is the operation save that that library of material those interviews
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:24.280]  those incredible information take the best interviews you just go pick what you
[2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:26.840]  think's most important going back over the last year and a half
[2:44:26.840 --> 2:44:30.600]  grab it and put it on your channel and do it fast because when they shut it
[2:44:30.600 --> 2:44:34.920]  down we couldn't get any of it off so evacuate evacuate now we'll keep getting
[2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:38.200]  more members and beefing it and spreading it while it's there
[2:44:38.200 --> 2:44:42.120]  but my gut tells me you know this is going to be over and over again
[2:44:42.120 --> 2:44:45.640]  filing with the federal court filing with federal court you know going okay
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:48.920]  you claim copyright let's go to court and then oh that wasn't real it was a
[2:44:48.920 --> 2:44:52.680]  fake one that's the kind of crap we're dealing with here ladies and gentlemen
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:56.120]  is it youtube doing it i don't know probably not
[2:44:56.120 --> 2:45:00.280]  we have all sorts of dirty tricks going on uh against us but anyways
[2:45:00.280 --> 2:45:05.000]  the the alex jones channel is up for now exodus get the material off

[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:25.160]  more in my life than than than now simply because the constitution
[3:02:25.160 --> 3:02:28.440]  did tells us that we're allowed to have one
[3:02:28.440 --> 3:02:31.720]  and uh as you say many times i listened to you
[3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:38.200]  since uh the the end of the summer uh because i didn't read you know when
[3:02:38.200 --> 3:02:40.040]  when you're in your journey it's like
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:41.280]  the worst place
[3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:45.400]  to be one of the worst states to be in because the people are so
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:50.280]  you talk about the constitution they said i'd it's not worth uh... uh...
[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:54.560]  you're just a piece of paper that doesn't give you any rights whatsoever
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:58.480]  and i love how because the bill writes a constitution isn't enforced
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:00.960]  and a bunch of enemies have you served us
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:03.460]  that'd be like a guy's broken and raped your wife
[3:03:03.460 --> 3:03:06.720]  and stabbed her five times and you came home and bitched at her and said
[3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:08.640]  because you got raped and stabbed
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:11.600]  i don't love you anymore instead of being mad at the people that did it
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:15.160]  yeah they the uh... the constitution is no good look at our system we need
[3:03:15.160 --> 3:03:17.720]  something else this isn't the constitution
[3:03:17.720 --> 3:03:20.440]  this is an overrun captured country

[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:07.880]  it got pretty crazy before we do that home game
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:12.200]  let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors h-o-m-e-g-a-i-n
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:15.480]  dot com home game dot com this is the place where you get started buying or
[3:10:15.480 --> 3:10:18.760]  selling a home finding a realtor and getting any real estate questions

[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:26.040]  what i'm talking about all you need to do is type in your home address you'll get

[3:10:38.760 --> 3:10:43.080]  that's home game dot com been around for ten years i just loved to death
[3:10:43.080 --> 3:10:46.600]  absolutely free look for max the orange gorilla on the front page of info wars
[3:10:46.600 --> 3:10:49.800]  dot com president dot com you forget the website home game
[3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:53.160]  dot com okay that said uh... let's
[3:10:53.160 --> 3:10:57.080]  go to uh... and you know i get wound up start yelling and screaming in here
[3:10:57.080 --> 3:11:00.200]  because i'm sick and tired of the government claiming it's patriotic
[3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:02.680]  and good when it's a bunch of globalist openly that want to get ready u.s
[3:11:02.680 --> 3:11:05.640]  sovereignty on record and they've totally loaded and destroyed us
[3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:08.600]  they've militarized the police and military to suppress us while they do
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:12.040]  this crime and the military and police are having their future destroyed and
[3:11:12.040 --> 3:11:15.240]  the military and the police are the key to everything
[3:11:15.240 --> 3:11:18.360]  because tyranny will come to our door in a uniform
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:22.520]  or tyranny will fall generally with a uniform
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:25.480]  that's usually where the catalyst like the people trying to overthrow hitler
[3:11:25.480 --> 3:11:29.960]  or military and so you're the target jack
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:33.240]  and you may think you're a you know cop who kind of keeps their mind shut
[3:11:33.240 --> 3:11:37.880]  believes whatever they're told uh... whatever you're the target too
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:42.680]  and you better wake up i told you i told you they're coming for veterans guns
[3:11:42.680 --> 3:11:46.760]  it's on record i'm so angry it's up on prisonplanet.com

[3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:53.160]  and a lot more uh... get it up on screen for folks i need this
[3:11:53.160 --> 3:11:57.400]  to go mega viral now this is high treason we need our story to be seen by
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:12:00.440]  everybody to then force it to the mainstream media
[3:12:00.440 --> 3:12:03.640]  this is so outright and then when the media tries to whitewash it well
[3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:06.760]  veterans could be dangerous we need to register all veterans guns
[3:12:06.760 --> 3:12:10.440]  this is all veterans not just active duty this is going nationwide
[3:12:10.440 --> 3:12:14.200]  and yeah veterans should be able to buy guns anymore they might be unstable
[3:12:14.200 --> 3:12:17.960]  uh... they're going to send new troops after you
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:22.120]  let's go to prisonplanet.com and pull up that top article that paul watson
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:25.800]  has up there right now for everybody to see it or is our internet so lightning

[3:14:23.480 --> 3:14:26.200]  wasn't expecting to happen to me and uh... it's
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:29.960]  uh... it left me absolutely shattered physically and mentally i tell you that
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:32.920]  and i'm not exaggerating i'm in for a walk in the park that only encourages
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:35.560]  them tell them you love it and actually make yourself love it

[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:54.040]  go ahead well um well what happened to me is uh i was getting so
[3:14:54.040 --> 3:14:58.200]  harassed in uh in the resort where bill deberg the bill deberg conference was
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:02.440]  happening uh over the weekend that i i couldn't take it anymore and i
[3:15:02.440 --> 3:15:06.600]  uh i i left and even as i was leaving i was hailing a cab and i was
[3:15:06.600 --> 3:15:12.280]  held at the side of the road uh and uh they they came around me again asking
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:14.440]  me what i was doing you know checking my name
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:17.560]  but sometimes the private security comes i couldn't even leave
[3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:20.760]  i couldn't even leave the the resort where bill deberg was happening i just
[3:15:20.760 --> 3:15:23.640]  wanted to get out of there i was going to go to Athens eventually
[3:15:23.640 --> 3:15:26.440]  eventually i got i was allowed to go and get into a cab
[3:15:26.440 --> 3:15:30.040]  went to i went 20 kilometers away to Athens
[3:15:30.040 --> 3:15:33.000]  i get out of the cab turn around and there's two guys on scooters just
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:36.520]  parking up the road looking at me and i know i you know i know it's them
[3:15:36.520 --> 3:15:41.000]  i go off with my rucksack on my back into the streets of Athens they follow me
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:46.120]  uh i duck in the stairwell they walk past
[3:15:46.120 --> 3:15:49.720]  and uh it got more and more extreme and uh
[3:15:49.720 --> 3:15:53.880]  it ended up with me um filing a report at the police station the police saying
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:57.000]  next time this happens they say that we they say we don't know who's following
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:00.600]  you next time it happens call the police and i said i think it is the police
[3:16:00.600 --> 3:16:03.800]  uh but they said look all we can tell you is call the police
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:08.120]  so next morning uh i'm being followed again i duck around in different streets
[3:16:08.120 --> 3:16:11.000]  they're following me coming after me i know this makes me sound paranoid but
[3:16:11.000 --> 3:16:14.920]  this actually did happen uh eventually i come around the corner there's the guy
[3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:18.600]  again i take his photo no but see how your program stop yeah and then they
[3:16:18.600 --> 3:16:22.040]  come up to you and tell you not to but stop right there
[3:16:22.040 --> 3:16:25.720]  i grabbed him and i i i phone the police but i mean hold on one second we're
[3:16:25.720 --> 3:16:29.160]  going to finish the story when you grab them
[3:16:29.160 --> 3:16:36.120]  here's how the conditioning works every time i i'm talking about bill deberg
[3:16:36.120 --> 3:16:39.880]  they would say it didn't exist then when they're spying on you they say it
[3:16:39.880 --> 3:16:43.080]  doesn't exist and then you're apologizing saying i know
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:46.200]  this sounds crazy but it really happened all these reporters caught the same
[3:16:46.200 --> 3:16:50.520]  stuff on video happening with them yeah but again there's this preconditioning
[3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:53.960]  where it's like you that are bad uh because you're
[3:16:53.960 --> 3:16:58.520]  reporting uh that this is happening so again this is the heavy conditioning
[3:16:58.520 --> 3:17:01.880]  break the conditioning you can do it mr. skeleton go ahead
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:04.760]  no i know exactly i'm prefacing pretty much every sentence i speak at the
[3:17:04.760 --> 3:17:09.320]  moment with i know this sounds crazy but but and i know this sounds crazy but
[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:13.560]  i uh anyway i grab a i grab them that we have a tuffle in the in the greek
[3:17:13.560 --> 3:17:16.920]  metro station and this has gone crazy at this point i don't know what i'm calling
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:19.720]  i'm shouting for the police i'm shouting help
[3:17:19.720 --> 3:17:23.080]  police come i get detained the other two get waved away
[3:17:23.080 --> 3:17:26.200]  uh these two guys were starting to give orders to the uniform police at this

[3:34:15.480 --> 3:34:18.200]  and he said they would change the reality from week to week and we wouldn't
[3:34:18.200 --> 3:34:21.640]  believe the new reality and for all the yuppies that's what they do
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:25.160]  they like to feel like they're winners so nothing can be above them
[3:34:25.160 --> 3:34:28.760]  they're members of the elite now they're not it's like a three-year-old playing
[3:34:28.760 --> 3:34:33.240]  like they're a you know a superhero they're not really a superhero but
[3:34:33.240 --> 3:34:39.160]  don't tell a three-year-old that don't tell a power mad yuppie that so i'll
[3:34:39.160 --> 3:34:41.960]  shut up here for the next five minutes tell us what else happened so you're
[3:34:41.960 --> 3:34:45.400]  there he's telling you the police aren't following you
[3:34:45.400 --> 3:34:48.040]  even though you've been taken to the police station twice by them
[3:34:48.040 --> 3:34:52.760]  the police stations don't exist now the planet doesn't exist what happens next
[3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:56.520]  well my mouth actually falls open he took heat and he looks at me and he says
[3:34:56.520 --> 3:34:59.400]  shut your you should be sitting there with your mouth open that's rude
[3:34:59.400 --> 3:35:04.440]  and i say to him it's rude to lie and he's i said to him i looked around the
[3:35:04.440 --> 3:35:07.080]  room there's three of them in there i said you know including the guy i'm
[3:35:07.080 --> 3:35:10.840]  talking to who's a very high up in the department of government security and
[3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:15.240]  let me back up he said he said hold on a second he said so you start over you
[3:35:15.240 --> 3:35:18.920]  did what with your mouth and he said do something that's rude
[3:35:18.920 --> 3:35:22.200]  well you know he said my mouth fell open with absolute shock in fact he
[3:35:22.200 --> 3:35:25.800]  simply denied the the fact that i'd seen this guy they've been following me
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:29.080]  uh... realizing he's a policeman my mouth fell open with shock
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:31.640]  he says you're sitting there with your mouth open that's rude
[3:35:31.640 --> 3:35:34.440]  and i just looked at him i said it's rude to lie to me
[3:35:34.440 --> 3:35:37.640]  and i said this is the craziest situation i've been in this is crazy
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:41.800]  and he goes for me it's not crazy for you it's crazy
[3:35:41.800 --> 3:35:46.040]  and i'm swear to god it was like being in it in the uh... horrific dystopian
[3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:49.960]  movie except it was happening to me and i was just
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:52.680]  it sounds like the prisoner when number six
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:35:55.800]  you know they had all those phony trials doing the same crazy stuff
[3:35:55.800 --> 3:36:01.640]  but see all those movies in 1984 and all that are based on real stuff
[3:36:01.640 --> 3:36:07.160]  yeah and i you know but i wouldn't always leaving i just i realized at that
[3:36:07.160 --> 3:36:10.520]  point that was it the fact i'd seen that guy i knew now what happened i was
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:14.040]  being followed by a quite large number of
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:18.520]  uh... the state police and uh... i don't know what that cost i don't know what
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:22.600]  cost it thrown at this operation well you know why i mean normally in there
[3:36:22.600 --> 3:36:25.640]  they just make sure the heroine comes in to make sure the school kids get it i'm
[3:36:25.640 --> 3:36:28.920]  not joking they only run prostitution and drugs in Greece
[3:36:28.920 --> 3:36:32.440]  very corrupt and they're running the drugs into europe and also a lot of sex
[3:36:32.440 --> 3:36:35.960]  slavery law kidnapped kids those guys don't do a lot of work they mainly
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:40.920]  kidnapped children deal deal heroine i'm serious when i say that and so
[3:36:40.920 --> 3:36:44.920]  you know to them it was a big joke they were there the big heroine dealers
[3:36:44.920 --> 3:36:47.720]  sent them out that's what bill berg does laundered the money
[3:36:47.720 --> 3:36:51.240]  you know big super bosses are in town that their bosses work for
[3:36:51.240 --> 3:36:54.440]  and so to them it was a big joke to terrorize a british slave
[3:36:54.440 --> 3:36:57.720]  who thought he was free it was a big joke to them they were just thinking about
[3:36:57.720 --> 3:37:00.360]  shipments of kids and things they had to deal with go ahead
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:02.840]  well i mean i don't know i couldn't i can't put thoughts like that in their
[3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:05.400]  head oh really you didn't know they're in child slavery so we have the greek
[3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:08.840]  sorry i'm not i mean well i don't know but what i do
[3:37:08.840 --> 3:37:10.920]  know is that they lied to me and they lied to me
[3:37:10.920 --> 3:37:14.680]  persistently and all the way up to the top and they lied even when they knew
[3:37:14.680 --> 3:37:18.520]  i they knew that i knew they were lying it was just one big lie and
[3:37:18.520 --> 3:37:21.720]  when i left i i talked to one of the one of the younger ones that scores me out
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:23.640]  of the building at this point because i thought well that's it like i'm not
[3:37:23.640 --> 3:37:26.520]  getting any more out of this i know now what happened and i was
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:29.720]  escorted out of the building and um i was on the way down on the stairs i
[3:37:29.720 --> 3:37:34.680]  looked at the guy and i said listen you know that when you tell a lie it
[3:37:34.680 --> 3:37:38.680]  tell a lie like that it makes you less of a person and do you know to his
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:42.280]  credit he looked ashamed because i just felt at that point like i had
[3:37:42.280 --> 3:37:45.880]  nothing else to cling on to except the truth about the situation the truth
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:51.560]  that that that these lies are being told to see charlie to them
[3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:56.200]  to them they have the force they have the power and the gun so they say that
[3:37:56.200 --> 3:37:59.560]  makes their lie real yeah that's like austin cops when
[3:37:59.560 --> 3:38:01.880]  i was in front of the dying court building and i said you know they they
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:05.160]  were on giant child kidnapping rings congressional hearings and the austin
[3:38:05.160 --> 3:38:09.320]  cops laughed and said yeah big deal we you know i i do work in there
[3:38:09.320 --> 3:38:12.680]  so to them it was like by making it a joke
[3:38:12.680 --> 3:38:16.520]  it didn't exist now i was a real guy telling him something real
[3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:19.480]  but see they weren't involved the child kidnapping
[3:38:19.480 --> 3:38:23.640]  but by making a joke about it you see they become accomplices
[3:38:23.640 --> 3:38:27.320]  see it's all real funny till it happens to their kid
[3:38:27.320 --> 3:38:30.600]  or till they're sitting there dying a cancer when they're 45 because they
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:34.120]  took the shots then it won't be funny
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:37.720]  but you know what i did what i have to take away from it though is a few
[3:38:37.720 --> 3:38:41.160]  important things which is i you know i i was stopped and searched stopped and
[3:38:41.160 --> 3:38:45.320]  searched so much and told to show my papers so much like i mean you know
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:49.720]  it was it was a horrific amount of time that i was having to just show who i
[3:38:49.720 --> 3:38:52.680]  was give my father's name how how long was i staying there
[3:38:52.680 --> 3:38:57.240]  i've become rapidly anti-id cards and by extension microchipping because
[3:38:57.240 --> 3:39:00.680]  that's just that's this game over when that happened it's game over
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:03.880]  it really is i can see that now and i didn't know that before
[3:39:03.880 --> 3:39:07.400]  and i know that now because i've lived you know in a weird little
[3:39:07.400 --> 3:39:12.280]  kind of reality show um police state for uh for the last week and you know i'm
[3:39:12.280 --> 3:39:15.160]  i'm not kidding i'm not joking i did and it was horrific
[3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:19.160]  and uh and i was scared for my you know i was scared for my safety i jumped
[3:39:19.160 --> 3:39:21.560]  into a random cab at one point and then sped to the
[3:39:21.560 --> 3:39:24.360]  british embassy which happened to be closed it was a Saturday
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:26.520]  well you don't want to arrive at the embassy scared out of your life would
[3:39:26.520 --> 3:39:30.440]  be told the embassy is closed that's their words you don't want to hear
[3:39:30.440 --> 3:39:33.320]  anyway but you know these things were happening to me and
[3:39:33.320 --> 3:39:36.600]  and you know then bill deberg was happening at the same time and
[3:39:36.600 --> 3:39:39.800]  then but no one was there the press wasn't there you know and i was being
[3:39:39.800 --> 3:39:42.920]  chased around the bathroom metro station and you know
[3:39:42.920 --> 3:39:46.440]  it it was quite crazy and quite surreal but
[3:39:46.440 --> 3:39:50.040]  but the surrealist thing of all is that where would you know
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:53.720]  where was the media where were the newspapers and how much did it all cost
[3:39:53.720 --> 3:39:57.960]  and why were there private security companies the security officers are
[3:39:57.960 --> 3:40:01.640]  detaining me and and why was the greek navy deployed and
[3:40:01.640 --> 3:40:05.960]  two f-16s and and and where was cnn you know the whole thing is just this crazy
[3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:11.640]  bubble of questions that people because if cnn admits bill deberg exist
[3:40:11.640 --> 3:40:16.920]  that then legitimizes everything we've done but instead by them still denying
[3:40:16.920 --> 3:40:19.560]  it exists that's just discredited them but they're
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:23.080]  still in this delusional world where they're going no the emperor is wearing
[3:40:23.080 --> 3:40:25.480]  the finest clothes and we're going no he's butt naked
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:28.680]  and they're like but we have swat teams and we go that still won't put food in
[3:40:28.680 --> 3:40:30.760]  our bellies you know and they're like but we have
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:34.520]  swat teams and we go yeah but we have the truth and they're like but we you
[3:40:34.520 --> 3:40:37.240]  know we have bird flu we can scare you with
[3:40:37.240 --> 3:40:40.680]  so i i've got collars for peter and iraq many others
[3:40:40.680 --> 3:40:43.720]  with inside reports on the department of the army telling veterans they've got
[3:40:43.720 --> 3:40:46.360]  a secretly register their guns even their own private
[3:40:46.360 --> 3:40:50.600]  homes that is coming up but finishing up with you
[3:40:50.600 --> 3:40:53.960]  mr. skelton from the london guardian and we'll have you back up in the future
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:56.520]  you know probably with jim tucker later in the week if you can do it for you
[3:40:56.520 --> 3:40:59.080]  know with both of you because jim's just gotten back we're giving him time to
[3:40:59.080 --> 3:41:03.080]  rest and then have him on because you know this does chart the future of the
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:06.120]  world we've proven they really are calling the shots
[3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:10.040]  uh... promotes the planet bill berg and of course those which not newsworthy in
[3:41:10.040 --> 3:41:12.440]  the media won't touch it because it's so important
[3:41:12.440 --> 3:41:15.320]  how did this end i mean how did it go after you left the police station what
[3:41:15.320 --> 3:41:19.320]  happened when you went to the airport uh... just briefly anything else
[3:41:19.320 --> 3:41:22.680]  uh... well i was do you know what i had that i had that fear in the pit of my
[3:41:22.680 --> 3:41:26.600]  stomach that i i'm that suddenly from from being stonewalled and being let
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:30.280]  out uh... i'd actually suddenly uncovered something so i was scared
[3:41:30.280 --> 3:41:33.720]  again i was suddenly scared because i'd seen the guy and the guy and then i'd
[3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:36.280]  been lied to you and i thought oh god i don't know what's going to happen now
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:39.320]  i know that sounds crazy but it doesn't i'm saying it again there you go um
[3:41:39.320 --> 3:41:44.200]  but uh... uh... i so i i got as fast as i could to an internet cafe
[3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:47.960]  and i i got on the phone to my wife i dictated what has happened
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:52.200]  i i i sent i sent copy to the guardian as soon as i could
[3:41:52.200 --> 3:41:54.360]  because you know when you know something and you know something's happened
[3:41:54.360 --> 3:41:57.000]  that you have to share it instantly because then
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:00.440]  information out there so i did what i could to get it out you know this is
[3:42:00.440 --> 3:42:02.920]  sounds like an overreaction but i wasn't overreacting because i've been
[3:42:02.920 --> 3:42:06.280]  chased around happens and been grappling and then arrested twice so quit
[3:42:06.280 --> 3:42:08.120]  saying that that's part of the program
[3:42:08.120 --> 3:42:11.560]  just quit making excuses for yourself what else happened
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:16.600]  uh... well i sent it off and you know i i just sat there absolutely shell shocked
[3:42:16.600 --> 3:42:21.800]  and i came home you know and i've just been sitting here like a vegetable and
[3:42:21.800 --> 3:42:26.200]  yeah just you know i'm absolutely exhausted by the whole thing and
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:29.240]  and but i've also determined to go back again next year and
[3:42:29.240 --> 3:42:33.880]  to get people to be you know to bring the camera why is the guardian yeah go
[3:42:33.880 --> 3:42:36.120]  back next year well why is the guardian running a
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:39.560]  photo of you from your comedian work wearing a clown mask
[3:42:39.560 --> 3:42:42.920]  i mean i guess the guardian can only report on this if they put you on a
[3:42:42.920 --> 3:42:46.680]  clown mask on the cover what is that about uh... with respect
[3:42:46.680 --> 3:42:50.760]  with respect that that's me that i bought i went to the uh... national museum
[3:42:50.760 --> 3:42:53.320]  of greece and that's a copy of an ancient uh...
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:42:56.600]  uh... that's a mask uh... and it's my little way of saying that i was
[3:42:56.600 --> 3:42:59.480]  involved in a kind of theater a theater of the absurd
[3:42:59.480 --> 3:43:03.000]  so that was my little joke uh... because i think it is a theater where i was
[3:43:03.000 --> 3:43:06.600]  just going to show i just i actually got a peek behind the uh...
[3:43:06.600 --> 3:43:10.600]  the curtain and it is all theater they're kidnapping kids running drugs right
[3:43:10.600 --> 3:43:13.080]  behind the curtain they're running the whores they're
[3:43:13.080 --> 3:43:17.160]  pushing the pros actor riddling the vaccines their eugenicist above them
[3:43:17.160 --> 3:43:20.280]  and it's all a theater for all the little cows all the little
[3:43:20.280 --> 3:43:24.120]  slaves to never figure out the right behind the curtain there's a slaughter
[3:43:24.120 --> 3:43:27.240]  house a meat grinder going twenty four seven

[3:44:10.600 --> 3:44:14.360]  joan california do you have inside knowledge on this
[3:44:14.360 --> 3:44:19.560]  being more widespread than just at fort campel kentucky
[3:44:19.560 --> 3:44:23.640]  yes well alex yes go ahead joe hey sorry hi alex
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:27.960]  uh... my name is joan from california and i was formerly a unit armor at
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:32.440]  fort campel kentucky um i'm not sure if you know i'm sure most of your
[3:44:32.440 --> 3:44:36.440]  leaders know the hierarchy in the army and not that i want to take away from
[3:44:36.440 --> 3:44:40.120]  this but i think it should be viewed in its proper perspective
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:44.200]  one military members are basically non-citizens
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:47.960]  they've given up their rights under the bill of rights and they
[3:44:47.960 --> 3:44:51.000]  basically got under admitt you are a martial law
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:54.840]  and i let me stop you that's not let me stop you let me stop you that's not
[3:44:54.840 --> 3:44:58.760]  entirely true and i do know i do know they can't make troops take
[3:44:58.760 --> 3:45:02.280]  experimental vaccines they can't order troops to rape children
[3:45:02.280 --> 3:45:05.400]  they can't order troops to march in and be nerve gas in a test which they've
[3:45:05.400 --> 3:45:09.320]  done so i mean to to tell somebody we want to know
[3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:12.920]  at your private home or off base what guns you own
[3:45:12.920 --> 3:45:15.640]  i mean i mean you're really saying that that uh...
[3:45:15.640 --> 3:45:18.760]  that they don't have any rights i have a car
[3:45:18.760 --> 3:45:23.240]  that i used to drive and in that state has an insurance law
[3:45:23.240 --> 3:45:26.600]  the commander can have a safety briefing which every one of them does every
[3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:30.760]  weekend before the soldiers take off to go get drunk and do whatever they do
[3:45:30.760 --> 3:45:34.200]  he can we inspect every vehicle and make sure that all the tell lights work
[3:45:34.200 --> 3:45:35.400]  there's no broken
[3:45:35.400 --> 3:45:38.600]  glass at the our registrations up to date they have current insurance
[3:45:38.600 --> 3:45:42.760]  and if they don't he can confiscate their keys right there and not let them
[3:45:42.760 --> 3:45:45.800]  be able to listen listen that's them telling you they have that power
[3:45:45.800 --> 3:45:47.880]  and that's if you bring that stuff on base
[3:45:47.880 --> 3:45:51.720]  what i'm telling you is do you believe that troops can be forced to take
[3:45:51.720 --> 3:45:55.560]  experimental anthrax and smallpox shots well we're talking totally different
[3:45:55.560 --> 3:45:57.720]  subjects let's try to speak to the subject matter again
[3:45:57.720 --> 3:46:00.600]  now i gotta let you go listen i gotta let you go you call back
[3:46:00.600 --> 3:46:03.800]  another day when i have time only got about 15 minutes 14 minutes left
[3:46:03.800 --> 3:46:07.640]  and i need to get to people who are confused see i asked for calls on this
[3:46:07.640 --> 3:46:11.640]  subject i asked for calls do you specifically on
[3:46:11.640 --> 3:46:15.400]  other bases know of them making you register your guns
[3:46:15.400 --> 3:46:19.320]  and you just called in defending it basically
[3:46:19.320 --> 3:46:23.160]  okay that's not what i asked for i'm specifically
[3:46:23.160 --> 3:46:27.480]  i need peter from iraq to call back in the deep did he call back in
[3:46:27.480 --> 3:46:30.360]  there's a two minute delay on the internet keep a line open for him
[3:46:30.360 --> 3:46:33.640]  joe i'm not mad at you you can call back we're gonna argue all day long
[3:46:33.640 --> 3:46:37.480]  okay if the military says that troops have to slit their own throats they do
[3:46:37.480 --> 3:46:40.200]  military says kill all these children you have to do it i guess
[3:46:40.200 --> 3:46:43.240]  hitler was good and and then the troops that followed him were good
[3:46:43.240 --> 3:46:47.080]  that's a load of crap okay and i've actually read the codes and
[3:46:47.080 --> 3:46:49.320]  all the little booklets they're giving and what's happened
[3:46:49.320 --> 3:46:53.160]  no whatever man just believe whatever you want you're obviously been an officer
[3:46:53.160 --> 3:46:56.840]  as you said over the weapons and so you got into that power trip and you
[3:46:56.840 --> 3:46:59.240]  believe that crap you go ahead and believe it
[3:46:59.240 --> 3:47:02.360]  just don't come after my guns i don't care if your boss says you're allowed to
[3:47:02.360 --> 3:47:05.240]  take them just don't try i'm not saying that's what you're
[3:47:05.240 --> 3:47:09.720]  saying but that's where they can lead peter in iraq is back okay peter go
[3:47:09.720 --> 3:47:12.920]  ahead
[3:47:12.920 --> 3:47:18.600]  he's got to do like peter in iraq go yeah peter in iraq go ahead
[3:47:18.600 --> 3:47:23.800]  okay yeah i'm uh i actually found this report the same one you look at on a
[3:47:23.800 --> 3:47:27.320]  website called a well-regulated militia um it
[3:47:27.320 --> 3:47:33.000]  dated 12 march 2009 i was deployed then when it came out i hadn't
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:36.600]  heard anything though i will say when i came back
[3:47:36.600 --> 3:47:42.120]  my last deployment was six of seven they did take old firearms from us for the
[3:47:42.120 --> 3:47:46.680]  ones that had firearms for i think it was what 30 days
[3:47:46.680 --> 3:47:51.080]  because of so-called psychological issues they put them in the hot room
[3:47:51.080 --> 3:47:54.840]  no fuss i mean they got them back after that but it's gonna be clear yeah i
[3:47:54.840 --> 3:47:57.800]  read about that the troops are are so untrusted
[3:47:57.800 --> 3:48:03.000]  that for a month after you get back from iraq all your weapons are taken
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:08.680]  yeah yeah definitely and um well i mean do you have this confirmed on other
[3:48:08.680 --> 3:48:12.440]  sources because it seems like the telling commander put this out
[3:48:12.440 --> 3:48:17.320]  and i have uh on that way it says that it was basically countermanded meaning
[3:48:17.320 --> 3:48:21.480]  like yeah no no that's what i'm trying to find out i was told this is going on
[3:48:21.480 --> 3:48:25.320]  in texas separately i heard about this a week ago and forgot about it then i
[3:48:25.320 --> 3:48:29.000]  saw this email and article found out world net daily weeks ago it reported on
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:32.280]  it and that they'd said it was just that base commander doing it but i'm
[3:48:32.280 --> 3:48:35.000]  telling you i have talked to military people that say
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:38.840]  that that that they're being told to do this so i'm putting the call out
[3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:43.160]  for military to call in and tell us if this is happening on your base
[3:48:43.160 --> 3:48:48.200]  uh anything else from iraq there peter okay
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:52.040]  uh no not really um i just want to say that like i mean
[3:48:52.040 --> 3:48:55.240]  most times i've been looking here for i don't know about three months now and
[3:48:55.240 --> 3:48:59.160]  it's like you need to be demonizing military almost as much as
[3:48:59.160 --> 3:49:04.600]  dhs is i mean you'll be it seems like most times they
[3:49:04.600 --> 3:49:08.600]  kind of refer to us almost as a jack wooded bug when in all reality
[3:49:08.600 --> 3:49:12.680]  i mean as stew would really to set multiple times we're the ones
[3:49:12.680 --> 3:49:16.360]  who have sworn sworn an oath to defend the constitution
[3:49:16.360 --> 3:49:19.880]  and you're totally missing what i'm saying listen you're listen sir you're
[3:49:19.880 --> 3:49:23.320]  totally missing it you know the biggest army recruiting
[3:49:23.320 --> 3:49:27.400]  stations are in uh the check republic they're in the
[3:49:27.400 --> 3:49:30.920]  philippines they're in ukraine or mexico city
[3:49:30.920 --> 3:49:34.600]  that's new york times biggest recruiting stations are outside the us
[3:49:34.600 --> 3:49:38.200]  it's wrong to be turning our military into foreigners i'm against that not
[3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:44.280]  against the military i'm against that i am against the military training
[3:49:44.280 --> 3:49:48.120]  to take on the american people and and i've been to the drills
[3:49:48.120 --> 3:49:51.720]  i've witnessed it north com is announcing they're going to occupy the us
[3:49:51.720 --> 3:49:56.200]  that i've had former jack generals on saying it's unconstitutional and wrong
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:50:01.160]  i am against the military being misused if i was a german in 1937
[3:50:01.160 --> 3:50:03.880]  i wouldn't be against the german military i'd be against
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:07.800]  the direction the leader the furor was taking it
[3:50:07.800 --> 3:50:11.640]  so i'm pointing out that they're trying to cut the military's benefits
[3:50:11.640 --> 3:50:14.840]  and i defended that on happening i'm pointing out that they do test on the
[3:50:14.840 --> 3:50:18.040]  military i'm saying the brass in the higher ups
[3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:22.520]  like last hour i had john perkins you know work for the nsa
[3:50:22.520 --> 3:50:25.560]  taking over third world countries he'd go get orders from his generals
[3:50:25.560 --> 3:50:28.600]  about you tell this person do what we say we're going to kill him
[3:50:28.600 --> 3:50:32.200]  i'm saying our government doesn't work for us anymore
[3:50:32.200 --> 3:50:36.680]  do you understand how that's separate from you peter
[3:50:36.680 --> 3:50:39.640]  no i i totally understand that and i i kind of
[3:50:39.640 --> 3:50:44.120]  i woke up my last claimant because i'm like wow doing this stuff here

[3:52:26.680 --> 3:52:31.400]  fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[3:52:31.400 --> 3:52:35.400]  of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[3:52:35.400 --> 3:52:41.880]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one world government

[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:51.560]  trying to drag people up and the only thing is i find that most people are
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:54.760]  in the military or regularly and they seem to be
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:59.160]  just waiting for orders to come down
[3:55:59.160 --> 3:56:04.360]  so i would think a lot of more people are in the military exactly and so that's
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:08.920]  why homeland security says homeland security is for you
[3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:11.560]  and that's why there did you see the new york times where they're training

[3:56:44.200 --> 3:56:47.240]  military is waking up that's why the majority of money went to ron paul
[3:56:47.240 --> 3:56:50.280]  so they they just didn't count half their ballots ap reported
[3:56:50.280 --> 3:56:53.880]  john in missouri and then uh junior john quickly

[3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:19.240]  and they will do the right thing but if it push comes to shove and i've gone
[3:57:19.240 --> 3:57:22.520]  over this in my mind what will i do if they do come to my door looking for my
[3:57:22.520 --> 3:57:28.680]  guns and i've decided well i think i will give up my guns one bullet at a time

[3:57:57.240 --> 3:58:03.960]  oh yes sir i sure do uh this was going on a long time ago i was a post post vietnam
[3:58:03.960 --> 3:58:09.640]  vet i joined the army in 83 and uh they were trying to get us to
[3:58:09.640 --> 3:58:14.280]  register our guns and put them in the armory like that guy that called in
[3:58:14.280 --> 3:58:17.480]  about the armory i don't think he was an officer
[3:58:17.480 --> 3:58:21.240]  he was just one of the guys that worked in the armory where they held all our
[3:58:21.240 --> 3:58:24.200]  weapons and that's what they wanted to try to do back
[3:58:24.200 --> 3:58:27.480]  then they wanted us to keep our weapons on base
[3:58:27.480 --> 3:58:31.080]  and so i i basically told them i didn't have any
