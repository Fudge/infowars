[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.600]  This is the third and last day of Joint S.W.O.R.D., which is the People's Liberation Army's operation
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.680]  that simulates precision strikes on Taiwan with combat readiness patrols and exercises,
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.200]  you know, through the air and by the sea around the Taiwanese archipelago.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.760]  China has said they're getting ready to blockade Taiwan.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:36.360]  Eighty percent of the world's computer chips, the high-speed ones, come out of Taiwan.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.800]  More than half the world's trade goes through the South China Sea.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.640]  Taiwanese tech giant TSMC warns an invasion of the island would render its factory inoperable,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.240]  devastating global supply.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.600]  Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing company may not be a household name,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.000]  but its chips are everywhere, in iPhones, air conditioning units, smart doorbells, computers,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.800]  cars, F-35 fighter jets, and even NASA's Perseverance rover that landed on Mars.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.360]  But when I see one of the best investors of all time abruptly selling billions in Taiwan's
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.040]  semiconductor stock and not giving a clear answer as to why, along with the senator
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.960]  betting against the stock, who sits on the Committee for Armed Services, giving him
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.160]  access to classified military info, it makes me wonder if they know something that we don't
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.160]  about Taiwan.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.960]  This is going to have effects on the economy that are hard to describe, and you add that
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.560]  with what's happening in the world economy, we see in the auto loan area the worst level
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.360]  of people not paying their loan and defaults ever seen.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.040]  Echoes of New Century's collapse amid sudden fire sale of real estate loans as one bank
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.920]  sees 40 percent downside.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.080]  This is the real canary in the coal mine, commercial and, of course, private residential
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.680]  real estate loans being defaulted on at near record levels.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.600]  This is the third worst in history.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.840]  And the last time this happened, it was the harbinger of the 2008 collapse with real estate
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.480]  loans being defaulted on in 2007, leading to that.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.160]  China's the trillion pound gorilla, or should I say dragon on our back.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.720]  Chinese video shows the extent of the exercises, both human and hardware, including for the
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.320]  first time an aircraft carrier, the Shandong, as well as nuclear capable bombers.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.480]  Today's live fire drills rehearsed a blockade of Taiwan.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.160]  And as this Chinese animation shows, strikes against specific targets on the island.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.040]  In Beijing, the foreign ministry spokesman said the exercises were a serious warning
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.680]  to Taiwan's separatist and what he called external forces.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.800]  That is the U.S. and its allies.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.120]  Today, their retaliation for the meeting in L.A. between President Tsai Ing-wen, who insists
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.760]  Taiwan will remain independent, and Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who signaled the U.S. would
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.080]  help protect it from China.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.800]  And I said, if any leaders from the United States, be it Biden, be it Mitch McConnell,
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.040]  be it Chuckie Schumer, be it Kevin McCarthy, if any of them ever meet with the president
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.320]  of Taiwan, we'll see that as an act of war.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.040]  And we will probably, I've got their quotes here, invade Taiwan, and we'll start with
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]  a blockade.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.640]  Taiwan's a prickly pear to hold.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.680]  It's not easy to invade.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.200]  And obviously, it has allies.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.040]  And as soon as that invasion starts, all those naval assets that the United States has in
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.240]  the Pacific will be seeming straight towards Taiwan.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.760]  And this is one of the big problems China faces.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.000]  For China to prevail, it automatically has to attack American and Japanese assets, because
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.080]  these are the things that will come into play as soon as that invasion, of course, is setting
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.080]  sail.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.840]  So China has no option but to strike those first if it wants to prevail.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.960]  And as soon as it does, the war becomes regional instantly.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:11.320]  They encircled with not hundreds, but thousands of ships, hundreds of big ships, and then over
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.520]  a thousand small ships, thousands of aircraft, small planes, helicopters, jets, and have
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.800]  just been encircling and doing bombing runs.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.280]  Ships won't be allowed to reach waters northeast of Taiwan on April 16th, as China's local
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.400]  maritime officials issued a warning about potential rocket debris in the area.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.040]  According to a news release issued by the Maritime Safety Administration of southern
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.160]  Fujian province on April 13th, I believe and I know what China said.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160]  It's on the table.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:53.120]  It is it is being prepared for the encirclement, the blockade and the invasion of Taiwan.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.200]  It's Sunday, Sunday, April 16th, 2023.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.760]  This is going to be a very important show.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.520]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.680]  We made it even stronger.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.240]  The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere, Turbo Force is back in stock
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.320]  at Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.840]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours, should be
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.480]  called 10 hour energy.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.920]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.080]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080]  it.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.520]  It is the super fuel.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.960]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.960]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]  They go good with this.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.840]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.280]  This is the boss.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.040]  Turbo Force back in stock, discounted.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.040]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:17.160]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:30.160]  This is a live Sunday broadcast, April 16th, 2023, coming to you live, uncensored, unfiltered.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.520]  Okay, I did a lot of preparation for this broadcast yesterday and today, but this morning
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:43.200]  in the space of about an hour, when I got up about 6 a.m., I'd already been sent this
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.960]  video and then about an hour later, I went to Infowars.com and saw that it was posted
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.960]  there.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.440]  I'm not going to tell you what the video is yet.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.960]  Ask Jamie to post the video onto the live show feed.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.400]  We're going to be covering it right until next segment and the segments after.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.160]  And then I got sent it another time and then another time.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.840]  So that's three times I was sent it and then I found it on Infowars, the middle of that,
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.840]  which is good.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.040]  It shows getting a lot of attention because the video came out, the report came out, this
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:25.000]  incredible magnum opus masterwork came out a month ago, but it's just now going viral.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.880]  We're going to have it posted, the 24-minute video, under the live show feed at Infowars.com
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880]  as we speak.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.280]  It's going up right now.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.880]  Now we cover a lot of huge issues here and I don't normally have a drum roll.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.720]  I don't even build stuff up like most people do.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.640]  I just cover the big news right up front and just keep hammering.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.240]  I almost decided not to cover this tonight because I want to really try to do it justice.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:59.740]  So tomorrow I'm also going to get into this and I might just clear the decks of calls
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:06.800]  and guess we have tomorrow so that I could properly get into this information.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.600]  I watched this three times today and when you know what's going on and you understand
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.920]  the enemy's blueprint and architecture of control and dehumanization, you realize it's
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.840]  bigger than just dehumanization.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.000]  It's about geoengineering and terraforming the planet and it's about ending life on this
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.800]  earth as we know it in the globalist's own words.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.840]  When you really pull back from it, you realize this is not human.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.480]  What's orchestrating this, what's running this is working with collaborators but it's
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.160]  not human and it's really what the Bible tells us about.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.300]  So I want you to call everybody you know.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.360]  I want you to email your friends and family and neighbors and everybody else, text message
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.400]  folks and tell them tune in right now to InfoWars.com forward slash show and to Band
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.880]  Dot Video and if that link won't go out on Twitter and places, you can send out Madmaxworld.tv
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.560]  which sends you to Band Dot Video, go to the Alex Jones live show area, people can find
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]  the clip there.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.800]  Just go to Madmaxworld.tv, go to the Alex Jones live show page and send that link out.
[00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:22.286]  I could do, again, an entire college, not course, but four-year degree on this 24-minute video.
[00:09:22.286 --> 00:09:30.286]  So tonight, when we come back, I'm just going to start the video, which is mainly for TV viewers.
[00:09:30.286 --> 00:09:34.286]  It does not translate well on radio, so I will be narrating it.
[00:09:34.286 --> 00:09:37.286]  If you don't want to hear me narrate it, the video is being posted as we speak.
[00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:41.286]  It's already up there this morning, but we're posting it on the live show feed right now.
[00:09:41.286 --> 00:09:46.286]  And of course, I see a lot of my own research in this, and I see a lot of my own statements
[00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:50.286]  how this is going to work, because I can extrapolate out knowing how the globalists operate,
[00:09:50.286 --> 00:09:53.286]  what their next move will be, and then you can always find their own admissions of that.
[00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:56.286]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:09:56.286 --> 00:09:59.286]  The globalists feather so many people.
[00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:05.286]  They're poisoning the food, the water, the air with chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals.
[00:10:06.286 --> 00:10:08.286]  Electromagnetic pollution.
[00:10:08.286 --> 00:10:12.286]  And they are culturally, spiritually poisoning us and hitting us from every angle.
[00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:14.286]  They want the earth for themselves.
[00:10:14.286 --> 00:10:16.286]  They don't want all these people.
[00:10:16.286 --> 00:10:18.286]  They see us as useless eaters.
[00:10:18.286 --> 00:10:22.286]  And when you understand that the global lockdown, disease X, and COVID, and all of this
[00:10:22.286 --> 00:10:27.286]  is the admitted plan to train us to live under martial law, to train to lock us in our houses
[00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:33.286]  so the old economy falls apart, and then it's too late, and then they basically exterminate us.
[00:10:34.286 --> 00:10:37.286]  And that's what's happening is a controlled demolition of the economy.
[00:10:37.286 --> 00:10:42.286]  And I have stacks of articles showing that and dealing with that today.
[00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:48.286]  We have other really important stuff with Elon Musk, who definitely has turned towards our side now.
[00:10:48.286 --> 00:10:53.286]  He's going against their main attack, saying someone deserves to be put in prison.
[00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:56.286]  He said sterilize a child before they're consenting, 18.
[00:10:56.286 --> 00:11:00.286]  An adult should go to prison for life.
[00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:03.286]  Sterilize a child before they are consenting adult.
[00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:06.286]  You should go to jail for prison for life.
[00:11:06.286 --> 00:11:08.286]  That is throwing down the gauntlet.
[00:11:08.286 --> 00:11:13.286]  And, of course, this all ties into what we're about to cover on the other side.
[00:11:13.286 --> 00:11:17.286]  So let me go ahead and introduce to you what this is with an overhead shot, please,
[00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:23.286]  the videos on Infowars.com, the 24-minute documentary.
[00:11:23.286 --> 00:11:26.286]  It's like they're in a time machine.
[00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:29.286]  I don't call this fiction because this was done in China.
[00:11:29.286 --> 00:11:30.286]  This was done in China.
[00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:32.286]  They tried it in Australia and New Zealand.
[00:11:32.286 --> 00:11:33.286]  They tried it in Italy.
[00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:36.286]  They almost got it, but they had to back off.
[00:11:36.286 --> 00:11:38.286]  They're going to keep coming back for more bites on the apple.
[00:11:38.286 --> 00:11:39.286]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:11:39.286 --> 00:11:44.286]  It's called Beyond the Great Reset, and it's an animation firm.
[00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:51.286]  It's an international firm that mainly does weapons systems animations and industrial animations.
[00:11:51.286 --> 00:11:52.286]  So they're architects.
[00:11:52.286 --> 00:11:53.286]  They know what they're seeing.
[00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.850]  And I saw that before I even researched who made it.
[00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.850]  I said, these people really know architecture.
[00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.850]  That was the term I was going to use before I read their bio,
[00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.850]  was this is like architects.
[00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:09.850]  They see the architecture of this anti-human system that's being put in
[00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.850]  where they take our resources and build this robotic army that'll follow orders.
[00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.850]  And that robotic army basically mops us up while the propaganda tells us
[00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.850]  to stay in place, the help's coming, when it's that very group destroying us.
[00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.850]  This is the official UN plan.
[00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.850]  Destroy the economy, lock us down, and then inject people into FEMA camps
[00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.850]  and the emergency coven camps with injections that actually kill them,
[00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.850]  but have them sign a piece of paper opting in for it.
[00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.850]  This is all real.
[00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.850]  So when you watch this, you have to understand,
[00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.850]  this is what would have happened if people hadn't rebelled around the world,
[00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:43.850]  including China.
[00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.850]  This is where they wanted to get us.
[00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.850]  But they admit they're about to release more viruses and try it again.
[00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.850]  So the entire future is this, okay?
[00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:58.850]  So you're about to go into a time machine alternately from what would have
[00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.850]  happened if we wouldn't have woken up and backed them off
[00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.850]  and what they're still going to try again.
[00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.850]  This is their blueprint.
[00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.850]  This is their attack program.
[00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.850]  And the thing is so in your face but also so subtle, it works on dozens of levels.
[00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.850]  This is a masterpiece.
[00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.850]  And if it's been seen a million times in a month, most of that in the last few days
[00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:25.850]  since people finally found it, if it gets 5 billion views, we win.
[00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.850]  God has given us opportunity.
[00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:32.850]  If 5 billion people, it would be great if 8 billion saw it.
[00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.850]  But I'm saying if more than half see this and understand it,
[00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.850]  they will never get this done because this is like having the enemy plan.
[00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.850]  You see, oh, the Pentagon's all freaked out.
[00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.850]  A couple hundred pages of documents came out showing their battle plan
[00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.850]  and what's happening in Ukraine and what's really going on,
[00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.850]  and this could derail the whole war.
[00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.850]  This, just like endgame, is a critical piece that people would have understood that.
[00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.850]  Back in 2007 when I put it out, many did.
[00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:05.850]  If people understand this beyond the reset, it is game over.
[00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.850]  And I literally have had a vision, and I've talked about this, my vision,
[00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.850]  it's an imprinted thing that keeps happening.
[00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.850]  Post-encounters a third time, everybody keeps building this mountain.
[00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.850]  They keep saying, go to this mountain.
[00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.850]  They have this psychic message to do it.
[00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.850]  I have literally said over and over again, the image of the future
[00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:28.850]  and of our rebellion will be a man with a stick in his hand smashing a robot,
[00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.850]  and that is indeed what this is.
[00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.850]  So humanity's figuring it out.
[00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.850]  Human intelligence has got it.
[00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.850]  And I noticed this company never did anything like this.
[00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.850]  It was all dams and weapons projects and solar panel fields.
[00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.850]  But it's because they're involved doing the work for the globalists,
[00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.850]  they understand what's being built with these emergency FEMA camps,
[00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.850]  COVID camps that can hold tens of millions per country being built,
[00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.850]  and more and more and more and more and more.
[00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:55.850]  Then they were all out of virus.
[00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.850]  They beta-tested, normalized millions going to the camps.
[00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.850]  A bunch of them died, just like old folks in nursing homes.
[00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:01.850]  It sets the precedent.
[00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.850]  Then they build more of these camps, more of these camps.
[00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.850]  They had the military training during martial law to pull up in neighborhoods
[00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.850]  with the school buses to take the emergency center.
[00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.850]  It's all perfectly researched.
[00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.850]  I got chills all three times I watched it.
[00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.850]  So let me know what you think about it when we take calls about it tomorrow
[00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.850]  and go back over it in more detail.
[00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.850]  But we have a special guest that stayed in town to come on the show,
[00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.850]  so I'm not going to bump him, Matt Baker.
[00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:33.850]  But I'm going to get to this documentary, this time-traveling operation,
[00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.850]  when we come back, and we'll have just enough time in the next 45 minutes or so
[00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.850]  to play it, and then I'll give little comments throughout,
[00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.850]  because, again, it's mainly visual, not really audio.
[00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.850]  So for radio listeners, I'll translate it and give my analysis.
[00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.850]  But this is a masterpiece, and it's on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.850]  Get it and share it like your life depends on it, because it does.
[00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.850]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs,
[00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.850]  not do a mugshot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.850]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.850]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.850]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:16.850]  And it says, Political Prisoner, with an image of President Trump.
[00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.850]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.850]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.850]  Political Prisoner, with Trump on the front.
[00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.850]  They're in a mugshot jail background.
[00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:29.850]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.850]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.850]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:36.850]  No, I'm not running for President.
[00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.850]  It's a really nice navy blue, high-quality shirt.
[00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.850]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:40.850]  Alex Jones for President.
[00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:41.850]  .24.
[00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.850]  It's a fun, conversational piece, and a limited-edition shirt.
[00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.850]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:53.850]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:58.850]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.850]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.850]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.850]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:11.850]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:15.850]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:19.850]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedoes.
[00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.850]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:27.850]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.850]  It was almost as if there were a plan in full.
[00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.850]  It just can't happen.
[00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.850]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.850]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.850]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.850]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.850]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.850]  You silenced those voices.
[00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.850]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.850]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset,
[00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.850]  as soon as these globalists start going to prison.
[00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.850]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.850]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.850]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.850]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.850]  a signed copy at Infowarsware.com.
[00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.850]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.850]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.850]  You'll also know that you helped keep Infowars on the air.
[00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.850]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.850]  or unsigned copies.
[00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.850]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsware.com
[00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.850]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.850]  and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.850]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you.
[00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:58.850]  And thank you for your support.
[00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.850]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:06.850]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.850]  And that war is something that we can win.
[00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.850]  But it takes dedication. It takes commitment.
[00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.850]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to Infowarstore.com
[00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.850]  and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life
[00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.850]  while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.850]  Infowarstore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book,
[00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.850]  The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back and Stock,

[00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.850]  you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.850]  It's all available at Infowarstore.com.
[00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.850]  Some of the very best products.
[00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.850]  And a lot of you have never shopped at Infowarstore.
[00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.850]  You've been watching for years. You've been listening for years.
[00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.850]  But you've never taken the step to go to Infowarstore.
[00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.850]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.850]  Plus they keep us on air.
[00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:55.850]  So again, please take action.
[00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.850]  Go to Infowarstore.com today.
[00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:58.850]  And I thank you.
[00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.850]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.850]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.850]  www.infowar.com
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:29.920]  Alright, anybody that's listened to this broadcast for a long time knows I'm not playing games
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.280]  and almost everything we say is accurate and coming true.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:39.160]  I am 100% sure what you're about to see is exactly where we're going and I've said this
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:46.480]  many times but it's illustrated in an amazing graphic way very well done with animation
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.160]  and I've done a lot of analysis of this group.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:57.280]  It's a major graphics group for architecture and military and industrial systems and they've
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.720]  not done something political like this but that's what's going to beat the new world
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.960]  order is when all the people on the fence, when the good guys who weren't organizing
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.720]  finally get organized because they know evil's making its move.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.720]  So this is incredible.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.960]  If you go to the live show feed we'll put on screen the live show headline.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.980]  Right under the live show feed is this documentary and we'll put the headline for the live show
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:28.440]  feed back up so I can give it to radio listeners so they can go to infowars.com and find it.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.440]  Sunday live.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.720]  This is one broadcast you must not miss.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.640]  Alex Jones will lay out critical info and present game-changing film.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.640]  So let's get to it now.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.480]  Let me describe it and start playing it.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480]  Okay.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480]  It's called Beyond the Great Reset.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.200]  It's 24 minutes and 8 seconds long.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.200]  Beyond the Reset.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.200]  It's on infowars.com right now.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.560]  Suggest you download it in case you take it down from 3D Epics Inc. which is an international
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.280]  group.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.680]  And they made comments about it only after it was released explaining to people that
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.000]  yes plants do release carbon dioxide at night because the left was saying that isn't true.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.480]  Nobody wants to cut down trees.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.040]  I have CNN headlines saying cut down all the trees.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]  They're bad for the earth.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.280]  All carbon is bad.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.600]  And that's the real summation, the rest of the story that I'll explain after we air this
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.080]  and then Matt Baker comes in.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.160]  So let's go ahead and begin this and again I don't want to talk over it.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.920]  It's much better to watch this in your home.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.840]  It's much better to sit there and take notes but for radio listeners and everything I'm
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:35.960]  going to break down and point out some of the subtleties here but it's powerful.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.360]  And this is actually the industrial plan in civilization as we know it by tricking
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.520]  us into the green movement that is actually a post-human, post-carbon world.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.520]  And again you can do the two plus two equals four, not human running it.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.400]  But I don't cover that in the film but that's where this is going.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:23:02.080]  But it has a very powerful message at the end that with a simple stick we can take everything
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.640]  back and we have the will and we have nothing left to lose but our souls and our lives.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.840]  So here it is ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840]  Let's start rolling.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:26.880]  Again on there for radio listeners we see what they built in China, the U.S., Australia.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.920]  Giant camps, cupboard camps with drones flying around them.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.920]  This is the exact model.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.960]  Quarantine facility in North American prairies.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:48.040]  Post-carbon vehicles driving around.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.800]  How would they ever train you to be a slave and go live in a camp?
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.800]  How would they normalize it?
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.800]  This is the plan.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.800]  They admit it's the plan.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.920]  And only at the end do you realize how big the camp is.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:06.040]  Everybody's in it except for a tiny five percent of the public that work for the system.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.120]  And they'll be exterminated, of course, once they get rid of the general public.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.120]  The beta test is training you to stay in your house.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:25.120]  Operationals, everybody having to be sent to these systems.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.120]  And again, why is it robots and drones everywhere?
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.120]  Because they'll follow orders.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.120]  You can't get enough humans to go along with this.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.200]  Once they have the machines scaled up, now we go into the little dungeon where he lives
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.200]  for his safety, of course.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.200]  Locked down.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.200]  You learn for years and years later.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.200]  He's asleep by himself, 8, 11 a.m.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.200]  And he wakes up.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:16.200]  All he has is a tiny 20 square foot or 10 square foot back porch.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.200]  He observes what's happening to his neighbors.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.200]  Because if you volunteer for medical experiments, they claim they let you out.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.200]  Oh, and they let you out, all right.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.200]  In a body bag.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.280]  China actually ran this exact scenario.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.280]  Three million Uyghurs live worse than this.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.280]  And our media endorses it.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.280]  Face scanning.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.280]  We got his social credit score.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.280]  Lives with that neighbor.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.280]  Got his little iPad.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.280]  Good morning.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.280]  We are bringing to you today's most important news from around the world.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.360]  Despite all the extraordinary efforts, the government and health system workers
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.360]  are still struggling to bend the curve of growing cases caused by the latest
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.360]  variant of the virus.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.360]  Five more people died today and 30 million tested positively.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.360]  Citizens are now required to wear masks when they step out to the balconies
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.360]  of their isolation facilities and take them off only when they are back to the
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.360]  safety of their rooms.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.360]  Stay compliant.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.360]  Stay isolated.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.440]  And now, onto other news.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.440]  As the whole planet went on the righteous crusade against climate change
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.440]  and global warming, we are excited to spread the word about another
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.440]  successful project.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.440]  As science tells us, during the night, plants release CO2 into the
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.440]  atmosphere.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.440]  CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas that dramatically contributes to global
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.440]  warming.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.520]  Don't worry.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.520]  Almost 100,000 square miles of South American rainforest has been cleared
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.520]  and this area is used to construct one of the largest solar panel fields
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.520]  in the world that will provide us with a tremendous amount of clean energy.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.520]  We will keep fighting the deadly forests and defeat climate change.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.520]  That is all for today.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.520]  Stay tuned for tomorrow's news.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.600]  They know when they isolate, you become depressed, alone.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.600]  He takes a nap and remembers driving with his wife in their SUV,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.600]  going to the mountains, having a campfire.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.600]  How beautiful and amazing it was.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.600]  Year after year, he wakes up in the isolation cell.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:43.680]  Year after year, he wakes up in the isolation cell.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.680]  There's something about the isolation cell.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.680]  See, a lot of folks don't stay in the cell.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.680]  No.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.680]  They want to up their social credit score.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.680]  They push the button and the nice men come to help them.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.760]  They just wanted to go back to where it was.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.760]  They make you opt into it.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.760]  It's how it's all done.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.760]  Bruce Kowalski, your weekly food ration has arrived.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.760]  Drone drops it off, no human connection.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.760]  Total isolation that makes all mammals basically kill themselves.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.840]  You notice his food rations are little protein packets of bug protein,
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.840]  which is the official plan.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.840]  See, this is not exaggerated.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.840]  This is actually what they're doing.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.840]  Selling you dystopia as a way to get out of dystopia.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.840]  But you don't get out of the dystopia by submitting to it.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.920]  Wake up! Wake up!
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.920]  You need to get
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.920]  coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.920]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.920]  So support Infowars store. Listen, you need to put it as a priority.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]  You don't know. I don't know.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]  Krill oil. What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]  of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]  Maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.080]  Infowars, absolutely imperative. Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.080]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.080]  You have to have these products.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.080]  Every time I talk to you, you're either on the border exposing the cartels
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.080]  or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.080]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.080]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second?
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.560]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth. And again, I have Infowars to thank for that.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.560]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.560]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.560]  under Alex Jones and under the Infowars team. And I really do credit that
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.560]  as to why I'm able to get these types of clips.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.560]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, go where the story is.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.560]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to. So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.560]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.560]  And I really do credit Alex for really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.560]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.560]  after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.560]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.560]  a signed copy at Infowars.com. And there is a markup there
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.560]  because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.560]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.560]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.560]  Or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.560]  to go to Infowars.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.560]  and donate them to the library or get them to the local school.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.560]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.560]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.560]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.560]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes,
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.560]  the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.560]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.560]  and the hard work they engage in every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.560]  It's really just incredible. So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.560]  I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.560]  that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.560]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. And that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:44.560]  Most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great products
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.560]  that enrich and empower your life all at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.560]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.560]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.560]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.560]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:28.650]  So, psychological warfare on record is being used to train us to live as prisoners and
[00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.730]  accept dystopia.
[00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:34.610]  The short film is Beyond the Reset, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.370]  Share it like your life depends on it because it does.
[00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:41.930]  This is their real plan, their real admitted plan, but this is an illustration of where
[00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:45.970]  they want to take us, what they were able to do in China, and to a great extent, places
[00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.770]  like New Zealand and Australia and Italy.
[00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:54.330]  So he comes out, it's very subtle, he comes out, he's at first allowed to stand on his
[00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:59.250]  little porch, then he's got to wear a mask, then he can't even leave the porch, but it's
[00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:00.250]  very subtle.
[00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.290]  You notice a lot of people are there over the years coming on their balconies, soon
[00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.810]  there's nobody almost on the balconies.
[00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.650]  Oh, I guess they got released, they were fine, because they're saying they want to put us
[00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:15.890]  in the camps now to keep us from getting the virus, to protect us, you see.
[00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:18.370]  So let's continue with Beyond the Great Reset.
[00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:37.290]  Oh, he pulls his mask down, off his nose, just to smell the air.
[00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:42.650]  Here comes a drone, ever watching.
[00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:52.650]  And it stuns him, hazers him, and says, mask up your nose.
[00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:56.090]  Notice it's not a human voice, and I've noticed in China and Australia here, it's not a human
[00:34:56.090 --> 00:35:00.170]  voice, they don't ever hear humans, they want to depress you.
[00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.090]  It's back to watching the brainwashing.
[00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:08.810]  He's allowed to read Drag Ventures, Snow White, now Black.
[00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:12.330]  How it's great to have men competing against women, nothing but anti-human propaganda,
[00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:20.810]  green friends kill the tree.
[00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:21.970]  There's almost no media allowed.
[00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:27.650]  The Godfather movie is banned from our database for misrepresentation and stereotypization
[00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:35.010]  of the Italian community.
[00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:41.690]  Pulp Fiction movie is banned from our database for excessive violence and racist content.
[00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:48.690]  The movie 1984 never existed.
[00:35:48.690 --> 00:36:04.370]  It's 8 in the morning again, wakes up, and the years go by, goes out and waves the people.
[00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:22.250]  It's less and less, and the toxic Chinese made, solar panels are everywhere.
[00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:29.410]  Remember Biden's banning two-thirds of cars within seven years, it's all happening.
[00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.890]  All the infrastructure's being turned off.
[00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:36.090]  Don't worry, we've got an emergency camp for you.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:39.090]  You will eat some bugs.
[00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.090]  You will own nothing, you will have nothing.
[00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.090]  Funny, no neighbors coming out.
[00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:51.770]  We'll find out why in a moment.
[00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:55.090]  He hasn't clicked a contract to take the shot to be released.
[00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:03.090]  We've got a larger prison, a nicer one.
[00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.090]  The seasons pass, the years pass.
[00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.090]  Robots hover ahead, just like they do in China.
[00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.090]  All a plan.
[00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:16.090]  Small SWAT team units are nearby.
[00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:19.090]  Case has to be killed.
[00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:22.090]  Every week he gets his ration of bugs.
[00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:30.090]  He gets one can of soda a day.
[00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.090]  Plenty of fluoride toothpaste.
[00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:37.090]  There's a camera in his little cell, for the safety of course.
[00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.090]  All it is, is a high-tech death camp.
[00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:00.090]  You can say I'm a spoiler alert, we're already living this, this is not an entertainment.
[00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:05.090]  People you share the video with, they'll be able to see it for themselves.
[00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:10.090]  And now, on to other news.
[00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:13.090]  Say goodbye to cows and beef.
[00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.090]  As you might know, cows and livestock agriculture in general,
[00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.090]  is a source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.
[00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:23.090]  Cows fart, and the temperature on Earth rises one degree with each cow fart,
[00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.090]  contributing to global warming.
[00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:30.090]  This is why the authorities started a cow extermination program,
[00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.090]  and today the last herd of cows has been dealt with.
[00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:36.090]  The Earth has officially become a cow-free planet,
[00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.090]  and climate change is finally under control.
[00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:44.090]  You might get concerned, where would we obtain our proteins from?
[00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:49.090]  Chicken and pork are not commonly accessible products, and beef is gone now.
[00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.090]  Do not worry.
[00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:57.090]  Hundreds of alternative protein manufacturing facilities have been constructed on each continent.
[00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:01.090]  They process thousands of tons of protein-rich food.
[00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.090]  This alternative food contains way more protein than beef.
[00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:05.090]  Insects.
[00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:09.090]  It is cheap to cultivate, and it doesn't contribute to global warming.
[00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.090]  Kudos to science, and Green Agenda.
[00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.090]  And it's toxic, the chitin shelf.
[00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.090]  That is all for today. Stay tuned for tomorrow's news.
[00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.090]  Recycling Fee.
[00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.090]  Clean Energy Fee.
[00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:51.090]  Personal Greenhouse Gas Emissions Fee.
[00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.090]  Climate Change Fee.
[00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:56.090]  Diversity Fee.
[00:39:56.090 --> 00:40:00.090]  Your current remaining balance is 5 Central Bank Digital Tokens,
[00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:04.090]  and if not spent, it will expire in 7 days.
[00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:11.090]  And what can he spend it on?
[00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:15.090]  All brainwashing VR metaverse crap.
[00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.090]  Attention. Important announcement.
[00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:24.090]  Dear residents of the quarantine facility number 89.
[00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.090]  Great news.
[00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:31.090]  Here at Novagene Labs, we grant you a chance to participate in the trials of our new drug,
[00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.090]  which has been developed by our research team.
[00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:38.090]  This drug is absolutely safe, and will bring the end to the deadly virus
[00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:42.090]  we are all fighting together for the last several years.
[00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:48.090]  Those of you who chose to participate will get a significant social credit score boost.
[00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:53.090]  As the result, you will be relocated to a superior isolation facility,
[00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:57.090]  receive a higher universal basic income,
[00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:01.090]  and become eligible for an improved food ration.
[00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:05.090]  Should you choose to participate in the Novagene Labs clinical trials program,
[00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:08.090]  our specialists will visit you within the next few hours,
[00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:12.090]  make an injection, and will be daily monitoring your condition online.
[00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:16.090]  And they've officially announced all this.
[00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:19.090]  Make a difference.
[00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.090]  Follow the science, and make the right choice.
[00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:25.090]  Novagene Labs is not responsible for any side effects, injuries, or death
[00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.090]  followed after the injection.
[00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.090]  Looks snow.
[00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.090]  Sorry to hear that.
[00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.090]  He's one of the only people alive in the death camp.
[00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:44.090]  He was a slave and remembers traveling to Cuba and laying on the beach.
[00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.090]  But not anymore.
[00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:55.090]  The most powerful part's coming up.
[00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:59.090]  When they first put an isolation in their houses and broke his family up,
[00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:03.090]  they could all be nice and isolated, and we did the work for them.
[00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.090]  Ah, the old days.
[00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.090]  He will eat some bugs.
[00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:14.090]  It gives him utopia as a way out.
[00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:18.090]  It gives him dystopia as the plan.
[00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:21.090]  He wakes up again.
[00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.090]  Oh, there's one neighbor out.
[00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:29.090]  But they're only out because, oh, here comes the little...
[00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.090]  tricopter.
[00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:36.090]  They're about to take the shot.
[00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.090]  They're about to be free.
[00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.090]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:44.090]  There goes an armored vehicle rolling by.
[00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.090]  He comes out to see what happens the next day,
[00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:51.090]  and sees a very interesting yellow crash truck drive by,
[00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.090]  but it doesn't stop there.
[00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.090]  It's picking up somebody else that day.
[00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:57.090]  A few days later, he comes to pick the neighbor up for freedom.
[00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:02.090]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months,
[00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.090]  and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.090]  We made it even stronger.
[00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:10.090]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:17.090]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:23.090]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.090]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:30.090]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things
[00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:33.090]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything
[00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:37.090]  and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:40.090]  It is the super fuel.
[00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:42.090]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:43.090]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:44.090]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.090]  They go good with this, but this is the king Kong.
[00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.090]  This is the boss.
[00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:54.090]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, InfowarsStore.com.
[00:43:54.090 --> 00:44:00.090]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:04.090]  1776 Testosterone Boost is back in stock.
[00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:10.090]  It is a private label of the number one best-selling natural testosterone booster on the market.
[00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.090]  It does incredible things for men, but women also love it.
[00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:18.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to experience this product for yourself.
[00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:22.090]  I never have any issues in the libido department,
[00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:27.090]  but it's always good to supercharge it and take it to the next level.
[00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:29.090]  I'm just going to tell you a bottom line.
[00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:31.090]  My wife is blown away.
[00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:35.090]  I am a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the sheets.
[00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:42.090]  I'm telling you, at 49, I've got more energy in that department than I had when I was 18.
[00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:50.090]  I owe it all to 1776 Testosterone Boost, now back in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.090]  It's also great for your muscles, your body, your energy, your workouts.
[00:44:53.090 --> 00:45:00.090]  Get 1776 Testosterone Boost at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:05.090]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth,
[00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:08.090]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:14.090]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:19.090]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group.
[00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:22.090]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:27.090]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:32.090]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:35.090]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.090]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.090]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:45.090]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:50.090]  The media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.090]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.090]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.090]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:58.090]  The point is you can get the filters at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:45:58.090 --> 00:45:59.090]  They're discounted right now.
[00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.090]  Finally back in stock.
[00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.090]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:08.090]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:09.090]  It is.
[00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:14.090]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:15.090]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:17.090]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.090]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.090]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:25.090]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:26.090]  And I'm sorry.
[00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:27.090]  You want something like this?
[00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.090]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.090]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:31.090]  It's so good, in my view.
[00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:33.090]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:38.090]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:44.090]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.090]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:53.090]  But, you know, as I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:54.090]  I just can't do it.
[00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:04.090]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:06.090]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:09.090]  The New World Order.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:10.540]  You
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:48:00.020]  So the tricopter lands and an agent of the good guys gets out and waves happily at the
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:09.820]  woman who's about to get a shot of the man so they can go free and live in a nicer death
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.900]  camp.
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:18.340]  Remember that ad they told him it's totally safe, totally great, but at the end it said
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.300]  we're not responsible for illness, sickness or death.
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:27.460]  So he goes in, gives him the shot, wearing his hazmat outfit, which really is just a
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.460]  cover-up.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:39.940]  He's an executioner and takes back off into the sky, keeping us all safe.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:44.180]  Everywhere is 5G towers, everywhere are drones, armored vehicles.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.740]  The next day he comes out to see how the neighbor's doing.
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:52.140]  Well, they don't come out on the porch like they always do.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:56.380]  He sees this big yellow trash truck drive by, but it doesn't stop there, it moves on
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.820]  to pick up something else.
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:01.580]  And a few days later it comes back too.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:11.580]  There goes the yellow vehicle with the two drones on top.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:26.340]  2.41 p.m., three days later, wants to go check on his neighbor.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:33.380]  Comes out to the little balcony, he doesn't wear his mask, he gets tasered.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:39.140]  Notice nobody's outside now on their balconies, everybody seems to be gone.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:43.940]  And there's the yellow trash truck in front of the neighbor's house, with what looks like
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:53.220]  two drones carrying a body bag, with a man in a yellow suit covering his face.
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:50:02.500]  There's a biohazard sign on it, this is a bad person they just took away.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:08.900]  So now he realizes he has no hope, he's never getting out of here, never ending.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.500]  They're grinding up the dead bodies, feeding it to you as protein, not bugs.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:18.500]  It's only green, you're eating humans, and all the toxic wastes have bioaccumulated.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:24.420]  It's like you don't want to eat a big tuna, it bioaccumulates, you don't want to eat a person.
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.580]  So it's nighttime, he goes back in, sitting there thinking, what do I do?
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.940]  He goes to sleep and remembers the old apartment he lived in,
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.060]  with his wife, several years ago.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:48.020]  A whole different world.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:59.300]  A new virus that emerged in Asia a couple of months ago keeps spreading all over the world.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:04.580]  Some countries are imposing lockdowns and stay-home orders to protect their populations
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:08.100]  from this highly contagious disease. In our country,
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:12.020]  three persons in their 90s died of the virus in long-term care facilities.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:31.380]  The virus keeps spreading in our country. Almost 500 new cases have been registered last week.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.140]  As of today, the whole country is going into a complete lockdown.
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.580]  The health authorities are imposing a strict stay-at-home order.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:43.940]  While these measures are tough, they are temporary. We need only two weeks to bend the curve.
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:52:05.460]  The pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:09.860]  to reflect, reimagine and reset our world.
[00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:57.790]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:03.790]  The GPs and community pharmacies are also going really hard now.
[01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:07.790]  And of course the majority of our numbers are now going into those all-important second doses.
[01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:11.790]  But there is more vaccine available, whether it's Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca.
[01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:17.790]  You know, choose your poison, but you can go to any GP, any pharmacy and any of our state clinics to get vaccinated.
[01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:22.790]  Why and how ready should we be for the next pandemic?
[01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:27.790]  Well, governments are there to protect us.
[01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:31.790]  And so, you know, they have us practice for earthquakes.
[01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:37.790]  You know, they have a fire department with lots of full-time people to stop fires.
[01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:42.790]  They have armies that are there to deal with wars.
[01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:47.790]  But the pandemic is a disaster that they didn't prepare for.
[01:00:47.790 --> 01:01:00.790]  The extra resources required to have a global surveillance team, to make better diagnostic technologies, to do quick detection.
[01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:05.790]  It's actually not going to be that expensive once the world gets organized and makes it a priority.
[01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:12.790]  So active preparedness for the next pandemic, because as you've said, it's not a matter of if, but when.
[01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:14.790]  How do we actively prepare?
[01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:20.790]  And are you seeing anywhere in the world where there's actual preparedness for a future pandemic right now?
[01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:23.790]  Well, there is some good innovation.
[01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:34.790]  The idea of improving the vaccine so that they block getting infection, making them so they last a long, long time.
[01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:41.790]  Being able to make very cheap diagnostics that you could literally produce billions of very quickly.
[01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:44.790]  So the innovation side, I think, is starting to move.
[01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:54.790]  But picking how we strengthen WHO, create a special organization dedicated to pandemics, you know, how we staff that,
[01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:57.790]  how we get every country to practice, you know, for fire.
[01:01:57.790 --> 01:01:59.790]  You've got fire drills.
[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:00.790]  You've got signs.
[01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:07.790]  So we need a little bit of preparation so that we actually can stop something before it goes global.
[01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:11.790]  You know, so we'll have lots of outbreaks, but we don't need to have pandemics.
[01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:13.790]  Right.
[01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:14.790]  We don't know what we're eating.
[01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:17.790]  Is that the bottom line, Tom?
[01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:18.790]  No, we don't.
[01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:23.790]  In fact, right now we've confirmed this mRNA stuff is in the food supply.
[01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:26.790]  We know that Merck has a product called Sequevity.
[01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:29.790]  They've been injecting mRNA into pigs since 2018.
[01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:35.790]  We know that they can actually make what's called transmissible mRNA.
[01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:43.790]  And what that means is that they can put this stuff in an animal so that it transmits to whoever is ingesting whatever it is that they're ingesting.
[01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:46.790]  And they become vaccinated.
[01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:50.790]  So they could engineer this into plants, into animals, into various things.
[01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:55.790]  And if we don't get disclosure, if we don't, you know, pass some informed consent laws,
[01:02:55.790 --> 01:03:01.790]  what's going to happen is for all you guys that stood strong and said no to these mRNA vaccines,
[01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:04.790]  well, you're going to get them anyways right through your food.
[01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:14.790]  Everybody hears about myocarditis.
[01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:22.790]  What they don't hear is that a lipid nanoparticle plus a modified gene sequence is a nuclear bomb.
[01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:26.790]  It's not just that this COVID shot is dangerous for people.
[01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:32.790]  It's this platform of lipid nanoparticle plus gene sequence has never been proven before.
[01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:35.790]  And what we're finding is immune suppression.
[01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:39.790]  We're finding increase in cancer rates because of that immune suppression.
[01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:44.790]  We're finding reactivation of viruses because of that immune suppression.
[01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:47.790]  And I won't get into all the detailed mechanisms of why.
[01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.790]  I've studied this.
[01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:57.790]  We're seeing deaths from this shot at a rate higher than any medical product ever used on humanity before.
[01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:59.790]  None of these are approved.
[01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:06.790]  We are literally doing the largest experiment on humanity ever done, not knowing the long-term outcomes.
[01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:08.790]  We only have a year-and-a-half's data.
[01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:14.790]  And we have in the VAERS system 30,000 deaths, well over a million adverse reactions.
[01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:17.790]  We know that that system highly under-reports.
[01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:21.790]  In the Eurovigilance data, we have millions of adverse reactions.
[01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:25.790]  We have countless deaths from around the world.
[01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:34.790]  And in addition to that, we have all-cause death higher now in those who have received these shots than those who didn't.
[01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:38.790]  So we know there are very bad signals from this experimental therapy.
[01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:45.790]  And in addition to that, we know that this gene sequence normally a messenger RNA in our body.
[01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:47.790]  You're making messages right now, I am.
[01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:49.790]  We're making proteins all day long.
[01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:54.790]  That message goes away in a minute or two, or sometimes an hour or two if you need to make more protein.
[01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:57.790]  We'll be back with Matt Baker. Stay with us.
[01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:09.170]  I intend to take the InfoWars armored truck out, or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:14.170]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsStore.com, so I'm going to be able to take the truck out.
[01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:31.170]  I intend to take the InfoWars tank out, or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:10.170]  It's 24 minutes. Probably the most important information that I've seen in 29 years of battling the Globalist.
[01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:18.170]  It's beyond the reset. It's on InfoWars.com right now for free. Get it and share it. You have such power.
[01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:23.170]  But we've got to use the power we've got now before the AI fully goes in. We don't have much time.
[01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:26.170]  We're affecting the future battle space for the next thousand years.
[01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:33.170]  This is an emergency transmission. An emergency transmission. April 16, 2023 from Central Texas.
[01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:35.170]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:39.170]  All right. Great political activist Matt Baker is here with us.
[01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:43.170]  And we're going to talk about a lot of issues tonight in the hour we have left.
[01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:48.170]  But let's play a last minute of Beyond the Reset for viewers.
[01:06:48.170 --> 01:07:00.170]  Twenty years ago, I had a vision of this.
[01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:04.170]  That's why when I watched this this morning, it blew me away.
[01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:07.170]  And I watched it all unfold.
[01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:13.170]  But it was a man with the stick smashing the robot as the symbol of the beginning of the rebellion.
[01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:38.170]  And when I saw that, I've talked about it on air, actually, of the sword.
[01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:40.170]  And when you watch this, you say, oh, that'll never happen.
[01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:43.170]  This is going on in China and Australia right now.
[01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:51.170]  This is all run by the U.S.
[01:07:51.170 --> 01:08:00.170]  And that's why I'm going to take this 24 minute really documentary, cartoon documentary, animated documentary.
[01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:04.170]  And I'm going to add every sliver of the real thing.
[01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.170]  I'm going to show them saying it, the cartoon.
[01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:08.170]  I'm going to show them really saying in the real world.
[01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:16.170]  And I'm going to show the thousands of vans lined up, taking people to camps in Australia and in New Zealand and in China.
[01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:17.170]  I mean, this is the global model.
[01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:18.170]  This is it.
[01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:21.170]  Yeah, I mean, they had the camps in Australia.
[01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:26.170]  I knew people that were taking videos from inside those camps, you know, and the people got let out.
[01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:27.170]  But they were testing.
[01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:28.170]  They're testing the water.
[01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.170]  And they're building more normalizing.
[01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:32.170]  Oh, those big because they're building like 10 times more.
[01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:34.170]  And they're like, oh, now we're going to put you in it to protect you.
[01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:41.170]  That's the whole State Department FEMA announcement two years ago was they're going to have protected zones.
[01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:43.170]  So they put you in the camp for your safety.
[01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.170]  Yeah.
[01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:52.170]  And then this is just a warm up, because as we know, Bill Gates continually telling people about pandemic to call it pandemic to like he's Dr.
[01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:54.170]  Evil, a complete psychotic freak.
[01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.170]  And I get it.
[01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:57.170]  We all want to have fun.
[01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:59.170]  We still want to operate like things are normal, folks.
[01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:04.170]  If you don't resist this now, they've already got the gun loaded.
[01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:05.170]  Part two is coming imminently.
[01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:06.170]  You speak to that?
[01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:07.170]  Absolutely.
[01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:09.170]  I mean, that's why, you know, I do what I do, Alex.
[01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:11.170]  And that's why you do what you do.
[01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:14.170]  And to be honest, you're obviously a giant part of my life.
[01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:15.170]  And I really look up to you.
[01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:16.170]  No offense.
[01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:17.170]  I hate that.
[01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:20.170]  But a lot of people look up to me and they say, we love what you're doing.
[01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:23.170]  And I just want them to get out off their couch.
[01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:25.170]  I hate it.
[01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:31.170]  But that animated character that first smashes the drone that causes the chain reaction, you know, part is coming.
[01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:32.170]  That's who I admire.
[01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:33.170]  Yeah.
[01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:39.170]  The person that lost their job, a nurse or police officer, military person, because they wouldn't take any legal experimental shot.
[01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:42.170]  It's like the idea that I'm a hero fighting this.
[01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:44.170]  I would be a piece of garbage if I wasn't.
[01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:45.170]  It's not heroic.
[01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:46.170]  It's survival.
[01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:51.170]  If somebody shows me underwater and I fight Matt to get back up, it's not heroic, man.
[01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:54.170]  It's not heroic, but you are the architect.
[01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:57.170]  I mean, it's no doubt that you are crushing it.
[01:09:57.170 --> 01:10:00.170]  You are the number one voice that everyone knows about.
[01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:03.170]  We all listen and learn from Infowars.
[01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:07.170]  I mean, now you've exploded into a million mini Alex Jones out there in the world.
[01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:16.170]  But really, at the root of it all, at the heart of it all, in the architect chamber is Alex crushing out these talking points that now like regular average Joe's on TV.
[01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.170]  Tucker Carlson is talking about it.
[01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:20.170]  Joe Rogan is talking about it.
[01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:22.170]  Everyone is now waking up to what's really going on.
[01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:25.170]  And the thing is, is what are we going to do about it?
[01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:28.170]  Because the A.I. system is collapsing in on us.
[01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:31.170]  More and more of our world is becoming automated.
[01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:35.170]  There's going to become a point in time when you will not be able to fight this.
[01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:37.170]  It will be absolutely overwhelming.
[01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:39.170]  Automation is death because it's programmed by evil.
[01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:40.170]  Yeah.
[01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:44.170]  And I think I feel like a good allegory is almost what Putin has done.
[01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:49.170]  Everyone said even you said, well, I think Putin should have went into Russia, you know.
[01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:54.170]  And it's like when you're surrounded at a certain point and you you have no other option.
[01:10:54.170 --> 01:11:00.170]  And, you know, like if you're in a bar fight and the guy's coming at you with the knife and the guy's surrounded you, it's like pick the chair.
[01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:01.170]  It's time to just go.
[01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:04.170]  I might lose, but I mean, dude, I'm going to have to hit this guy at some point.
[01:11:04.170 --> 01:11:07.170]  And you want to hit him before you get your hands tied behind your back.
[01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:16.170]  No matter how hard your fight's going to be, it's going to be a lot better than when you're tied up and gagged in the back of a truck going to a FEMA camp.
[01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:17.170]  No, I agree.
[01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:18.170]  Russia didn't start it.
[01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:20.170]  And it's all coming out.
[01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:23.170]  And it shows how psychotic globalists are.
[01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:28.170]  Even Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst, has come out and said even the intelligence agencies are scared.
[01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:29.170]  They think we're about to kill everybody.
[01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:36.170]  I mean, this is insane because you've got these weird, crazy globalists are like 80 years old on average giving the orders.
[01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:37.170]  Where did these people come from?
[01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:40.170]  Like literally, you always talk about the Dark Crystal, the Skeksis.
[01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:45.170]  I mean, they literally look, you couldn't pull anyone out of central casting that was any creepier looking.
[01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:47.170]  I mean, these people are nightmarish.
[01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:50.170]  Jerry Nadler was, I just saw a picture.
[01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:52.170]  I took a clip for tomorrow's show.
[01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:57.170]  And he is now, his thing is like pants are up to here.
[01:11:57.170 --> 01:11:59.170]  Nancy Pelosi's face is down to here.
[01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:03.170]  I mean, Joe Biden is like walking around like he's pooped his pants the entire time.
[01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:05.170]  You see that clip of him in Ireland?
[01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:06.170]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:10.170]  Where he's like moving around like, you know, we've been set up for a fall as America.
[01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:12.170]  They admit they're injecting him with methamphetamine.
[01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:13.170]  Yeah.
[01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:15.170]  I mean, he doesn't know what planet he's on.
[01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:17.170]  What I mean about the Russia thing is this.
[01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:28.170]  I think it's just like an allegory for like at what point do we realize there's no escape and there's going to be a point like nobody wants, you know, action or civil war or violence or anything like that.
[01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:34.170]  But when things are inexorably running in a certain direction, at one point in the game, there's going to have to be a change.
[01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:38.170]  We're hoping it's an info war change and we are winning hearts and minds.
[01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:44.170]  You know, hopefully you'll get to a point where every person you talk to just knows what's going on and there will be no fight.
[01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:45.170]  I mean, I remember being in sixth grade.
[01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:46.170]  I wasn't a tough guy.
[01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:47.170]  I've never been in a fight.
[01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:48.170]  I was not a big guy.
[01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:54.170]  And this bully was like had flunked like two grades and was beating kids up and beating people up in gym class.
[01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:59.170]  And I when he did to me, I went ahead and, you know, attacked him and they pulled us apart.
[01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:03.170]  He said, I'm going to kill you after school when we go get on the buses.
[01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:08.170]  And I remember that thought of I'm not just going to hide or call my parents or try to go on the bus.
[01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:09.170]  I'm going to go meet him.
[01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:13.170]  And I, you know, got in a fight with him and things went on and things happened.
[01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:16.170]  And I felt good after I did it because I didn't run off.
[01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:19.170]  And it kind of comes a realization of he'll just keep beating me up forever.
[01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:21.170]  I don't just go ahead and go out of here.
[01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:22.170]  Exactly.
[01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:25.170]  Actually, when I was a kid, I grew up in the same thing happened.
[01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:32.170]  I mean, I think we all went through those trials and tribulations before those rites of passages were stolen from us by, you know, PC teachers and stuff like that.
[01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:36.170]  Now your right of passage, as we know, is cutting your dingaling off.
[01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:39.170]  But so there was a bully in this school.
[01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:41.170]  And eventually I was avoiding him.
[01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:42.170]  I was avoiding him.
[01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:44.170]  And eventually I was on a swing and he pushed me.
[01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.170]  And I was like, OK, now I'm going to have to fight this guy.
[01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:47.170]  I ended up fighting him.
[01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:49.170]  I ended up getting him on the ground.
[01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:52.170]  I got on top of him, but I never really had that killer.
[01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:54.170]  I never wanted to bludgeon or hurt.
[01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:55.170]  See, I did.
[01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:56.170]  That's why I hurt a lot.
[01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:57.170]  So I was like, all right.
[01:13:57.170 --> 01:13:59.170]  And I like I felt like you get it.
[01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:00.170]  I'm stronger than you.
[01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:01.170]  I've beaten you.
[01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:02.170]  And I let him up.
[01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:05.170]  And then this bastard comes right back at me and swings at me again.
[01:14:05.170 --> 01:14:08.170]  Now, luckily, I got the better of him again the next time.
[01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:11.170]  But I mean, at a certain point, you know, but he didn't respect you till you gave me a concussion.
[01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.170]  Right.
[01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:13.170]  I don't know the story.
[01:14:13.170 --> 01:14:17.170]  But, you know, I like I said, I never really, really wanted to bloody people much.
[01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:19.170]  I was actually really strong as a kid.
[01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:21.170]  So I would always overpower people.
[01:14:21.170 --> 01:14:22.170]  I grew like really fast.
[01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:24.170]  Like when I was a little kid, I was like super strong.
[01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:29.170]  And then when I got in high school, I'm like, can't we be more logical and talk this out?
[01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:33.170]  When the football players started getting like six foot five, I'm like, hey, I'm going to be.
[01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:37.170]  That's why I felt bad, because I would get to that satanic point where I actually was like, you know,
[01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:39.170]  I'm going to I'm going to chop him in the neck.
[01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:41.170]  And then they're like, they're in an ambulance.
[01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:42.170]  You're going to jail.
[01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:43.170]  Yeah.
[01:14:43.170 --> 01:14:44.170]  Well, he attacked him.
[01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:45.170]  But I have a bunch of me.
[01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:47.170]  I would just be like, then it came like the gunslinger.
[01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:48.170]  Well, this guy thinks he's tough.
[01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:49.170]  And everybody wanted to fight me.
[01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:50.170]  Yeah.
[01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:51.170]  Well, I traveled around a lot.
[01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:53.170]  So it was always a different group of people.
[01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:56.170]  So I would go in, I'd get picked on, and then I'd have to assert dominance.
[01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:57.170]  Go and get picked on.
[01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:58.170]  Assert dominance.
[01:14:58.170 --> 01:14:59.170]  You moved around a lot.
[01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:00.170]  Yeah.
[01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:01.170]  I moved around a lot.
[01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:02.170]  Actually, I don't know.
[01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:03.170]  You never really moved that much, huh?
[01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:04.170]  No.
[01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:05.170]  I mean, I was in Dallas and then in Austin.
[01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:09.170]  That's weird, because I think a lot of the people that are awake maybe are because they moved so much.
[01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:11.170]  A lot of the people that are awake moved a lot.
[01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:15.170]  Like Army brats seem to be really informed on average, because they've been everywhere.
[01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:19.170]  Yeah, because I think you see outside the cult or your local little brainwashing world.
[01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:20.170]  Like, you're in this little town.
[01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:21.170]  It's like, where are the bad guys?
[01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:23.170]  You're like, I'm walking back in another click.
[01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:24.170]  Yeah.
[01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:27.170]  And you go over someone else's town, and then you start seeing like they have their own weirdnesses,
[01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:30.170]  and they believe their own things, and their team's the best.
[01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:35.170]  And after a while, it all just starts becoming the same, and you start seeing the individual propagandas,
[01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:37.170]  and you see it on the macro level.
[01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:41.170]  And then you break somebody's neck, and it's not fun anymore.
[01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:44.170]  I'm not proud of it, but I've hurt some people, man.
[01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:45.170]  I'm not bragging.
[01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:46.170]  No, no.
[01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:47.170]  I mean, it's not even a good thing.
[01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:52.170]  We had to leave Dallas because of it, because I mean, I beat some people to death.
[01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:53.170]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.170]  Stay with us.
[01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:03.170]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:16:03.170 --> 01:16:07.170]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:09.170]  Here is a bulletin from PBS News.
[01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:11.170]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:15.170]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:19.170]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:23.170]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:27.170]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:29.170]  It was almost as if it were a plan imposed.
[01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:31.170]  It just can't happen.
[01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.170]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:16:33.170 --> 01:16:35.170]  That's enough!
[01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:37.170]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:39.170]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:41.170]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:43.170]  You silenced those voices.
[01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:47.170]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:53.170]  Soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:05.170]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com

[01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:09.170]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:16.170]  Turbo Force is back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:24.170]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:29.170]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:35.170]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.

[01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:42.170]  RainForce Plus is great, RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:43.170]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:46.170]  They go good with this, but this is the King Kong.
[01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:48.170]  This is the boss.
[01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:53.170]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:13.170]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements
[01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:16.170]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:18.170]  So support InfoWarsTore.
[01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:23.170]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know, I don't know.
[01:19:23.170 --> 01:19:26.170]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:32.170]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything, krill oil.
[01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:37.170]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview
[01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:40.170]  of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:43.170]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins,
[01:19:43.170 --> 01:19:46.170]  maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[01:19:46.170 --> 01:19:49.170]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:51.170]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:53.170]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:56.170]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:59.170]  You have to have these products.
[01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:04.170]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:06.170]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:34.450]  So, I cannot hype enough beyond the reset, the free 24-minute animated documentary is
[01:20:34.450 --> 01:20:35.730]  what it really is.
[01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:37.849]  This happened in China and other areas.
[01:20:37.849 --> 01:20:39.570]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:46.929]  From my knees, from my greatest point of besieging you, begging you, viewers, you are the power.
[01:20:46.929 --> 01:20:47.929]  You are the answer.
[01:20:47.929 --> 01:20:48.929]  You are the victory.
[01:20:48.929 --> 01:20:50.550]  Please share this.
[01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:53.610]  It has a million views in a month, and it just went viral today.
[01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:55.090]  It'll probably have five million tomorrow.
[01:20:55.090 --> 01:21:00.809]  It needs billions of views, and if you just get excited and share it, it's not my film.
[01:21:00.809 --> 01:21:02.570]  I don't give a damn who's filming this.
[01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:04.490]  I don't care who the best talk show is.
[01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:06.690]  I'm looking for the leaders to defeat things.
[01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:07.690]  This is powerful.
[01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:09.210]  I did the analysis on it.
[01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:14.990]  It is a company that does defense, and oil, and industry, and architecture, and they
[01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:20.610]  are exposing, because they can see the architecture of this processing system to take over humans
[01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:24.730]  and get rid of us, and make us obsolete from the enemy's own propaganda to the architectures.
[01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:25.730]  I went and looked them up.
[01:21:25.730 --> 01:21:26.730]  They're building some of the camps.
[01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:27.730]  They've been there.
[01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:28.730]  That's why they're freaked out.
[01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:29.730]  I mean, we've seen the camps.
[01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:33.969]  We've seen the camps in Australia.
[01:21:33.969 --> 01:21:34.969]  We've seen the camps in China.
[01:21:34.969 --> 01:21:36.929]  I mean, there's all kinds of footage of it.
[01:21:36.929 --> 01:21:37.929]  They got them here, too.
[01:21:37.929 --> 01:21:40.730]  I don't know if you guys watched that, but I was watching it in the green room, and it
[01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:45.050]  is just nightmarishly chilling, and I mean, amazing job rendering it.
[01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:49.410]  I mean, you look at it, and from everything that's been going on with Klaus Schwab and
[01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:54.330]  his great reset, it's all there right for you.
[01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:58.290]  The dystopia is painted, and this is the actual world that they're building.
[01:21:58.290 --> 01:22:00.010]  This is what they want us to accept.
[01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:03.330]  You see one piece here, and you go, oh, a little carbon tax, and it's no problem.
[01:22:03.690 --> 01:22:05.889]  Oh, a little COVID pass, that's okay.
[01:22:05.889 --> 01:22:08.330]  Oh, a little transgender, that's okay.
[01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:10.170]  Oh, a little vaccine, that's okay.
[01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:14.370]  But when you see the architecture, and you see what they're actually building, you go
[01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:17.210]  through the plans, and you see this is the electric plan.
[01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:18.469]  This is the floor plan.
[01:22:18.469 --> 01:22:20.050]  This is the roof plan.
[01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:23.330]  And then at the end, you see the picture, and you're like, oh my God, it's a freaking
[01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:24.330]  human being.
[01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:25.330]  That's right.
[01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:26.330]  You're a builder.
[01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:30.769]  Before I looked up who they were, I said, engineers made this, and it was engineers.
[01:22:30.769 --> 01:22:37.570]  It also shows that we have broken through to them because they're the ones who are behooving
[01:22:37.570 --> 01:22:41.809]  them necessarily to expose it because they're probably the ones getting the contracts.
[01:22:41.809 --> 01:22:45.330]  But it's like we always talk about, at what point are you going to realize that this world
[01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:49.610]  is not going to be worth living in if we don't crush these bastards?
[01:22:49.610 --> 01:22:51.730]  It's a circular firing squad.
[01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:52.730]  That's what I keep saying.
[01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:53.730]  Yeah.
[01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:57.010]  And so they're in there building the camps, and finally, you've got camp builders going,
[01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:58.250]  hey, dude, we're building a camp.
[01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:59.769]  Are we going to tell somebody?
[01:22:59.769 --> 01:23:02.290]  It's like, yeah, dude, it's time to blow the whistle.
[01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:05.809]  These people blowing the whistle, what's going on in Ukraine over there, and now they're
[01:23:05.809 --> 01:23:10.690]  the enemy because they're telling the truth that we actually are in a lie.
[01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:12.610]  Trump was supposed to get us in World War III.
[01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:15.330]  Throughout history, you look at World War III.
[01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:16.330]  What does it say?
[01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:19.050]  Well, whenever we start fighting Russia, that's going to be World War III.
[01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:20.050]  So what do we do?
[01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:23.330]  We go ahead and start World War III in the middle of this whole thing.
[01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:25.170]  And it's like, we're not fighting Russia.
[01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:30.130]  Meanwhile, we're sending them, the first time I've seen them sending tanks with USA
[01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:31.130]  on the barrel.
[01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:32.130]  I mean, that was it, dude.
[01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:33.130]  We crossed the Rubicon.
[01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:37.050]  And it's not, Biden said last year, he said, if we send battle tanks, it's World War III.
[01:23:37.050 --> 01:23:38.050]  Yeah.
[01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:39.210]  Because there's a threat escalation.
[01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:44.330]  And I wouldn't be surprised if now they may use nuclear disasters, nuclear explosions,
[01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:45.330]  real or fake.
[01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:49.250]  Well, the US led, it came out in the documents, which they admit are real now, an attack on
[01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:52.809]  the bigger plant in Chernobyl, and Chernobyl's in Ukraine.
[01:23:52.809 --> 01:23:55.450]  They attacked a nuclear power plant last month.
[01:23:55.450 --> 01:23:57.450]  And it's a new, it was a two week battle.
[01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:58.450]  I didn't see that.
[01:23:58.450 --> 01:23:59.450]  Wow.
[01:23:59.450 --> 01:24:00.450]  It's hardly in the news.
[01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:03.370]  And then when there's, they'll say, oh, the radiation is spreading.
[01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:06.370]  And just like you see in the movies, they'll start cordoning off areas just like they were
[01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:07.530]  doing with COVID.
[01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:11.849]  And if your town has a particular person like, oh, Austin just had a nuclear spill, we need
[01:24:11.849 --> 01:24:13.290]  to cordon off Austin.
[01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:14.290]  I wonder who lives there.
[01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:19.090]  It's like, and it just normalizes the cordons and the troops and the emergency alerts are
[01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:20.490]  just putting us into the new normal.
[01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:21.490]  Yeah.
[01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:24.410]  And you see the, you see the, uh, the people on that, um, that video that you were talking
[01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:27.050]  about beyond the gray reset or beyond the reset.
[01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:28.570]  And you have these black storm troopers.
[01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:32.630]  I was just at a recent, uh, city council meeting, uh, board of supervisors.
[01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:38.250]  And there was a lady there exposing the new outfits for the San Diego, uh, sheriff's department.
[01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:39.690]  And they are that outfit.
[01:24:39.690 --> 01:24:47.490]  I mean, they have full blacked out masks, full body armor, full Batman suits with all
[01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:51.490]  of the gear and giant guns with rocket launchers on them.
[01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:55.370]  And it was actually exposed by someone else's like, if only we had the money that San Diego
[01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:58.250]  has to gear up their, their, uh, sheriff's department.
[01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:59.250]  Well, that's it.
[01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:01.290]  They defund police and then remake it in their image.
[01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:02.290]  Yeah.
[01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:06.450]  We want people in blue helping kids getting cats out of tree and arresting pedophiles.
[01:25:06.450 --> 01:25:09.490]  We want, you know, that'd be nice, but they're, they're smart.
[01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:13.929]  They are getting rid of the local police by making them be thugs and by making them dress
[01:25:13.929 --> 01:25:16.769]  like like cops don't dress like Darth Vader.
[01:25:16.769 --> 01:25:18.650]  They're doing that to scapegoat you.
[01:25:18.650 --> 01:25:23.170]  You'll do their service and it's all psychological when you sit back and look at the enemy plan.
[01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:24.170]  It's like, wow.
[01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:25.170]  Yeah.
[01:25:25.170 --> 01:25:26.170]  I mean, you see the plan.
[01:25:26.170 --> 01:25:27.170]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:28.170]  It's all there.
[01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:30.130]  You just literally see only details of the plan.
[01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:32.349]  You see, Oh, this is how we tie the wall down.
[01:25:32.349 --> 01:25:36.370]  But then eventually you do see, and that's what I love about this movie that's been
[01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:39.469]  put out, uh, again, beyond the reset.
[01:25:39.469 --> 01:25:41.570]  I mean, this thing is crystallized this thing.
[01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:45.570]  If you could give it to a friend that's on the fence, I've got, to be honest, I have
[01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:50.450]  some friends now that are actually starting to come back after COVID they, we, we went
[01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:53.889]  our separate ways and now they'll, they'll come to me like, Hey, did you hear about these
[01:25:53.889 --> 01:25:54.889]  transgender kids?
[01:25:54.889 --> 01:25:55.889]  That's out of control.
[01:25:55.889 --> 01:25:58.250]  I'm like, even Tim Robbins has come out and said it was all a lie.
[01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:59.250]  Yeah.
[01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:00.250]  I mean, we're, we're winning.
[01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:01.250]  Exactly.
[01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:03.250]  I mean, Joe Rogan was kind of teetering in the beginning and then he came back over.
[01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:08.250]  I mean, you know, you got a lot of good people and we all, it's so easy if we all just unite
[01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:10.969]  and say, look, look at what we're looking at.
[01:26:10.969 --> 01:26:12.650]  It's a giant fricking nightmare.
[01:26:12.650 --> 01:26:15.530]  Can we please turn around and go a different direction?
[01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:17.490]  And everything they told us was a lie.
[01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:21.090]  You know, I got some, that's a little segue actually, um, this whole transgender thing
[01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:27.330]  and I hate this discussion and I specifically hate showing pictures of the particular individuals
[01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:31.210]  that are in it that are making money off of it because all it does is strides and affect
[01:26:31.210 --> 01:26:32.210]  these people.
[01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:33.730]  I keep posting on people's stuff.
[01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:35.809]  I'm like, stop showing their picture.
[01:26:35.809 --> 01:26:36.910]  Stop saying their name.
[01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:38.889]  It's like, it reminds me of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:26:38.889 --> 01:26:41.650]  You say the people promoting this are paid off to kill us.
[01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:46.010]  The laws, the schools, but in Sodom and Gomorrah where it was, we're in, they are, you're
[01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:48.330]  on the hill and you're looking back at Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:26:48.330 --> 01:26:49.330]  What do you do?
[01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:51.090]  You don't look back or you get turned into a pillar of salt.
[01:26:51.090 --> 01:26:54.570]  So all of our conversations and all of the things that we're trying to fight about the
[01:26:54.570 --> 01:26:58.010]  real issues that are fricking stack up to the ceiling.
[01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:02.010]  We spend all of our day talking about certain people who John, I'm not going to say their
[01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:06.969]  name and we're looking back and we're frozen in stone instead of building the new world
[01:27:06.969 --> 01:27:11.570]  over and over and over again, obsessing on it, saying that's evil, building a new world.
[01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:17.250]  A free world where we actually have freedom, where we build things, uh, the psychotic nature
[01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:23.050]  of leftists in general is this concept of not physically building things.
[01:27:23.050 --> 01:27:27.250]  It's always like subversion and, and like false flags, like, Oh, he wanted the devil's
[01:27:27.250 --> 01:27:28.250]  never a builder.
[01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:29.250]  He's a tiger.
[01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:30.250]  Yeah.
[01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:31.250]  It's like, we want to do something.
[01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:32.250]  We go, well, okay.
[01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:33.250]  We want a studio.
[01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:34.250]  It's like, all right, let's get some plans.
[01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.250]  Let's build a building.
[01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:36.250]  Let's do this thing.
[01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:37.250]  We'll hire these employees.
[01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:38.250]  We're like, let's take that thing over.
[01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:39.250]  It's like, we'll make this guy work for us.
[01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:42.410]  We'll catch him on camera and he'll work for us forever.
[01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:43.410]  Exactly.
[01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:48.290]  It's all, it's all so backwards and sickening and just disgusting and falling.
[01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:50.969]  That's why Christ said, get behind me, Satan, which is so profound.
[01:27:50.969 --> 01:27:51.969]  We're going forward.
[01:27:51.969 --> 01:27:52.969]  Yeah.
[01:27:52.969 --> 01:27:53.969]  Get out of our way.
[01:27:53.969 --> 01:28:00.170]  We're, we're charging into the goblin's nest, goblin, vomiting slob.
[01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:04.650]  We're not expecting him to get bit by a goblin, but we don't want to catch him in bed with
[01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:05.650]  a goblin.
[01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:06.650]  Sorry.
[01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:07.650]  I had to, exactly.
[01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:08.650]  I've been wanting to do that.
[01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:13.650]  He kind of does look like he's got a lot of, when it comes to Pfizer, he's like in a big
[01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:14.650]  orgy.
[01:28:14.650 --> 01:28:15.650]  There's a lot of goblin slime there.
[01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:16.650]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:17.650]  Oh man.
[01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:22.650]  Trump's like, I voted for him twice just so you know, I was being gangbanged by goblins.
[01:28:22.650 --> 01:28:23.650]  Yeah.
[01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:26.010]  He's gaping Trump and his gangbang of goblins.
[01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.010]  Yeah, man.
[01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:29.490]  I don't know what Trump is like a thousand gobbles lined up.
[01:28:29.490 --> 01:28:32.570]  I don't, I don't know, but he's doing good stuff when it's like, I'm going to destroy
[01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:34.130]  the deep state new world order.
[01:28:34.130 --> 01:28:35.849]  I will say, I was going to say this before I came on.
[01:28:35.849 --> 01:28:39.849]  I will say the one good thing, cause I do talk a lot of crap about Trump nowadays is
[01:28:39.849 --> 01:28:45.010]  I will say that we were not in world war three under Trump and everyone said we were going
[01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:46.010]  to be.
[01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:47.010]  That's why at the end of the day, I'd say Trump's still good.
[01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:48.010]  He's against world war three.
[01:28:48.010 --> 01:28:49.010]  We're not in world war three.
[01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:50.010]  That was nice.
[01:28:50.010 --> 01:28:51.010]  He's against world war three.
[01:28:51.010 --> 01:28:52.010]  Yeah.
[01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:53.010]  All right.
[01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:55.010]  Well, we're going to come right back and talk about Elon Musk and what he said about transgenderism.
[01:28:55.170 --> 01:29:07.690]  I intend to take the InfoWars armored truck out or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly
[01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:08.690]  called.
[01:29:08.690 --> 01:29:11.690]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsStore.com, so I'm going to be able
[01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:12.690]  to take the truck out.
[01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:26.350]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:35.350]  So, Jesus Christ said, you judge a tree by its fruits, and Ronald Reagan said trust but verify.
[01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:42.350]  So I'm not an apologist for Elon Musk. Elon Musk has said terrible things about me that aren't true, going along with the propaganda.
[01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:50.350]  But if I look at the arc of Elon Musk, total new world order, and now anti-new world order, he's going straight up.
[01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:53.350]  He came out Friday, he's on Tucker Carlson tomorrow night.
[01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:59.350]  Elon Musk slams transgender therapy for minors, says parents or doctors who sterilize children, this is a quote,
[01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:03.350]  sterilize a child before they are consenting adults should go to prison for life.
[01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:09.350]  Well, of course, if some crazy kidnapped your 8-year-old son and cut his dick off, they'd go to prison for life.
[01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:12.350]  But they all normalize it, it's all about control of the population.
[01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:18.350]  So this is a big moment here. Trump kind of followed it with a, you know, weaker response.
[01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:23.350]  But Trump promises safety investigation of transgender drug therapies, which, you know, really screw the kids up.
[01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:26.350]  We have this sickening video, go ahead and queue it up, guys.
[01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:32.350]  This father transitioned his son to a girl at three, made the decision, and says he will be a girl.
[01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:37.350]  So this is a sick cult. It's another form of human sacrifice. Matt Beggar, your take on it.
[01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:40.350]  Oh, my God, please don't do this to your children.
[01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:47.350]  I saw these young girls the other day on a clip, and they had cut their breasts off, and they were so happy.
[01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:50.350]  One had had it done, and the surgery had already healed, and they had their friend there like,
[01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:54.350]  oh, yay, you're getting it done. It's like, oh, your nipple might stay.
[01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:59.350]  My nipples, I didn't manage to keep my nipples, and I kind of look like a cyborg now.
[01:34:59.350 --> 01:35:04.350]  And they were like so happy. It's like back in the day you would give people something to be happy.
[01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:06.350]  You got a Christmas present. You got something.
[01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:10.350]  Now it's like they've trained you to actually like things being taken away.
[01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:13.350]  Yeah, you don't get your freedom. Exactly.
[01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:16.350]  And we all say circumcision is wrong. They don't know.
[01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:19.350]  Or the Muslims in some countries cutting girls' clitorises off, that's wrong.
[01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:21.350]  They are not of an age of consent.
[01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:23.350]  Right. We have to stop it.
[01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:26.350]  You can't trick a child to get in the back of the van with you.
[01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:28.350]  You go to prison. Like imagine a child molester.
[01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:33.350]  Well, I did kidnap the eight-year-old out of the backyard, but they got in the back of the van.
[01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:36.350]  They're not of consenting age, you murderers.
[01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:42.350]  Oh, God. I mean, the fact that we even have to have this fucking, I'm sorry, this conversation.
[01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:43.350]  It just drives me nuts.
[01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:49.350]  And I'll say it. The fact that we have to have this fucking conversation shows how screwed we are.
[01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:52.350]  Oh, my God. Talk about Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:35:52.350 --> 01:36:00.350]  Now, with all the estrogen mimickers and stuff that are in there, maybe there actually is a rise of this theoretical dysphoria
[01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:04.350]  that's happening outside of the brainwashing and the mind control that was in Brave New World.
[01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:06.350]  No, that's the precursor. They prime it with the chemicals.
[01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:07.350]  Yeah.
[01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:09.350]  And they go, oh, you're confused. Well, here it is.
[01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:11.350]  And it's just a coincidence that they put it in Brave New World.
[01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:14.350]  You're going to be genderless and sexless. Oh, that's just another coincidence.
[01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:16.350]  And notice, exactly, now it's sexless.
[01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:17.350]  Yeah. So you won't have sex.
[01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:19.350]  In Brave New Worlds, they have shaved heads.
[01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:24.350]  Your only joy is clicks on the Internet because you did what you were told to.
[01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:27.350]  I wore a mask. I cut my penis off. I did this.
[01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:30.350]  You know, it's like I submitted to the system. I'm cool.
[01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:35.350]  And since when do the rebels, the left claims are rebels while they're all funded by the establishment?
[01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:36.350]  Yeah, I actually have.
[01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:38.350]  Oh, Demolition Man in the 90s predicted it all.
[01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:41.350]  I mean, I have some kind of a weird solution to this a little bit.
[01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:43.350]  It's out there. No one's ever heard it.
[01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:47.350]  So if these kids, let's say your kid is acting a little fruity, perhaps.
[01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:51.350]  Why do you say they're going to affirm his gender by turning him into a woman?
[01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:57.350]  If you go into the doctor and you have high blood pressure, do they go, well, you, you identify as someone with a heart attack.
[01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:59.350]  Let's just pump your heart attack up and do that.
[01:36:59.350 --> 01:37:04.350]  Or if you have low blood sugar, high blood sugar, they'll bring it back to a normal level.
[01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:10.350]  Like if your son's acting a little fruity, maybe he actually needs a little testosterone, not some estrogen.
[01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:12.350]  Which we know is flatlined.
[01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:19.350]  Yeah. And it's like the reason why I know this is real is because I went to a bar back several before COVID.
[01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:22.350]  And I was arguing with this lesbian girl.
[01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:25.350]  And she had her other friend, her lesbian lover was there.
[01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:28.350]  And the lesbian lover was like the femmer one.
[01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:30.350]  And she was still a fairly good looking lesbian.
[01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:32.350]  And you could take her away in 10 seconds.
[01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:34.350]  I didn't want to. She wasn't the kind.
[01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:39.350]  But the more manly of the two, she was like telling her girl, it was like, no, no, we can have this discussion.
[01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:41.350]  We can we're going to logically argue this out.
[01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:43.350]  And I was arguing with this woman.
[01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:48.350]  And at one point in the argument, I said, you feel like you have testosterone.
[01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:51.350]  I don't know where I got it. I never even knew they did it.
[01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:52.350]  She admitted she was on it.
[01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:54.350]  She said, I just got the shot on Monday.
[01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:57.350]  And now all of a sudden she's OK to engage in a logical argument.
[01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:58.350]  That's the weird thing.
[01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:00.350]  They don't want men to take it when they suppress it.
[01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:01.350]  But they're pushing it on women.
[01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:06.350]  So if your boy is a little off or, you know, like take super male vitality or something.
[01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:13.350]  All the studies show if you're depressed, go out and go out and hike or exercise.
[01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:17.350]  And I have to tell you, when I was hitting puberty, I was playing sports.
[01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:21.350]  I was doing it all. But there was nothing like fighting.
[01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:27.350]  Not saying fighting is a good thing, but it's part of what we do that would literally just it was amazing.
[01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:34.350]  It like moves your whole nervous system and all your ganglia and everything and all your endocrine system.
[01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:36.350]  And all those ancient memories kick in.
[01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:44.350]  Yeah. And it's like it also gets you out of your head because all of the thoughts that they have around in this world are just psychotic, satanic thoughts.
[01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:46.350]  They're bombarding you with constantly.
[01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:50.350]  It's like, don't you want to say the person's name who won't be said on my lips?
[01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:52.350]  And that's kind of the fight club thing.
[01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:55.350]  But like people agreeing to go fight. It's so good.
[01:38:55.350 --> 01:39:00.350]  But when you get out and you do something you love, like I like to blow glass or I like to build things.
[01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:05.350]  And it's like when you're actually in the middle of cutting wood or doing something like that, your brain gets out of that world.
[01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:08.350]  And in a way, you use it out. Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:13.350]  And so that's when you kind of open your mind up and like what people achieve through meditation or whatever.
[01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:19.350]  You can actually they're like gardening or cutting wood or I've been like plowing fields or shredding.
[01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:21.350]  And after like five hours, you don't want to go to lunch.
[01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:25.350]  You're like it's like it's a drug.
[01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:30.350]  Yeah, actually, after the 10 pool bash the other day, I woke up and I was like, oh, my God.
[01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:33.350]  And I started like getting panicky. I'm like, oh, I got to go on the show.
[01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:35.350]  I need to be ready. Went for a bike ride.
[01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:38.350]  Went for a bike ride down the lake. Felt better when I got back.
[01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:41.350]  Just start seeing the trees and the birds like, hey, we're still having a good time.
[01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:44.350]  Like everything's fine. You sit there just tripping in your own head.
[01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:48.350]  Oh, I'm going to be totally depressed and just go for like a five mile hike.
[01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:52.350]  And I am just like, like the trees are drugs, which studies show.
[01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:54.350]  Yeah, it's a magical universe.
[01:39:54.350 --> 01:40:00.350]  I mean, how can we be alive in a universe that has all of this going on and all of these cells
[01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:03.350]  and all these parts of the human body that works so perfectly,
[01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:08.350]  like a trillion Swiss watches stacked on top of each other through a trillion years of time?
[01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:13.350]  And yet people look at it and go, well, I think it would be better if I just cut my dick off.
[01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:14.350]  Yeah, well, it's like Bill Gates, right?
[01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:17.350]  He'll probably like a good guy, good people.
[01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:20.350]  You can feel it, you know, and it's like that's the thing.
[01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:21.350]  Everybody knows about contact highs.
[01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:26.350]  They have over a thousand major studies of when people drink beer or alcohol,
[01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:30.350]  the people next to them get drunk and we are psychically connected.
[01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:35.350]  And that's what I'm saying is they're bombarding us with psychic stuff to bring us down.
[01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:40.350]  When we just raise our resident vibration, raise the vibration.
[01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:43.350]  My people focus on what we got to do to get out of this.
[01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:48.350]  And like I said, I was really my jury was really out on on Elon Musk.
[01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:51.350]  I really thought he was a satanic globalist.
[01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:55.350]  And you're actually one of the first people to say, you know, these fruits are coming up pretty good.
[01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:59.350]  He could very well be one of these people like these people building the death camps.
[01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:01.350]  They're like, you know what?
[01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:04.350]  He realizes that he's building his own prison, his own nightmare.
[01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:06.350]  Well, his own daughter won't talk to him.
[01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:07.350]  And it's becoming a man.
[01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:08.350]  Exactly.
[01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:09.350]  Cutting her tits off.
[01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:10.350]  So let's talk about this.
[01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:12.350]  Elon Musk is here.
[01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:19.350]  Let's say in 2005, he's a globalist.
[01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:24.350]  And now as you go to the year 2020 and above, it's skyrocketing.
[01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:27.350]  So I'm not trying to say I trust him.
[01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:28.350]  But why?
[01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:30.350]  He is literally turned against their whole system.
[01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.350]  You can't lie with the curve.
[01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:40.350]  I mean, in the grand scheme of things, like when we really go up against Skynet, like it's probably not going to be carpenters are going to win that battle.
[01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:41.350]  It's going to be hackers.
[01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:42.350]  It's going to be robot engineers.
[01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:45.350]  It's going to be the people that built the chips that are in the things.
[01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:47.350]  Hopefully, it's going to be the people that saw it coming.
[01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:48.350]  Yeah.
[01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:51.350]  The people building the chips build their own backdoor into it.
[01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:55.350]  So they know when Skynet goes live, they can just pull the plug whenever they need to be.
[01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:57.350]  I mean, think about this.
[01:41:57.350 --> 01:42:00.350]  People talk about our dominance from Elon Musk.
[01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:02.350]  It's another thing is about all these satellites he has.
[01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:08.350]  Like, how do we know people like America has all these satellites when we have dominance because of all these satellites?
[01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:10.350]  But how easy theoretically would it be?
[01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:15.350]  I mean, they might have the ability and just not pull the plug like we have nuclear bombs that we don't explode.
[01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:18.350]  They could have backdoors into all of Elon Musk's satellites.
[01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:24.350]  And when the when the battle really goes hot, your satellites just go through or they just turn over to the enemy.
[01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:26.350]  Like they're just autonomous automatons.
[01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:28.350]  So they can just get hijacked.
[01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:30.350]  It's like I take a gun away from you and use it against you.
[01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:31.350]  Exactly.
[01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:33.350]  So that's what that's what in the grand scheme of things.
[01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:35.350]  This is probably how this is all going to go down.
[01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:40.350]  People like Elon Musk to actually start getting the full picture of the plans of the Death Star.
[01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:42.350]  Well, let's talk about more.
[01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:45.350]  Let's just say Elon Musk was bad for the sake of conversation.
[01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:47.350]  Why is he doing what he's doing?
[01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:51.350]  That's a very important question because they know there's major opposition.
[01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:53.350]  Can they lead the opposition?
[01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:54.350]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:15.350]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:17.350]  So support InfoWars store.
[01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:22.350]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:26.350]  I don't know. Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:31.350]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:39.350]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:41.350]  And I would urge everyone.
[01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:42.350]  Maybe you don't take vitamins.
[01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:44.350]  Maybe you don't take nutritional supplements.
[01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:45.350]  But the day will come.
[01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:46.350]  Vitamin C and zinc.
[01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:48.350]  Absolutely imperative for the cold.
[01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:49.350]  DNA force.
[01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:50.350]  Absolutely imperative.
[01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:51.350]  Mineral fusion.
[01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:52.350]  Absolutely.
[01:43:52.350 --> 01:43:55.350]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:58.350]  You have to have these products.
[01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:03.350]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:04.350]  This is their big move.
[01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:08.350]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:10.350]  He doesn't care.
[01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:11.350]  That's not his job.
[01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:13.350]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:17.350]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:21.350]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:23.350]  They must be opposed.
[01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:26.350]  And that's autocrats only understand one word.
[01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:29.350]  No, no, no.
[01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:30.350]  Exactly.
[01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:33.350]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:37.350]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:39.350]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:42.350]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:45.350]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:48.350]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:49.350]  You're right.
[01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:51.350]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:53.350]  And we say no.
[01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:55.350]  And we say no to your war.
[01:44:59.350 --> 01:45:04.350]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to

[01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:03.350]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:05.350]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:25.130]  Welcome back, it's the Alex Jones show, Matt Baker at 8 a.m. Central tomorrow, 9 a.m. Eastern
[01:47:25.130 --> 01:47:29.330]  will be hosting Harrison Smith's show because Harrison's wife just had a new baby, he's
[01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:30.330]  been awful last week.
[01:47:30.330 --> 01:47:34.330]  We'll look for that at 8 a.m. tomorrow in fullwords.com forward slash show.
[01:47:34.330 --> 01:47:37.130]  Matt, you were getting into Elon Musk.
[01:47:37.130 --> 01:47:40.210]  To me, if he's fighting the globalists, that's great, doesn't mean I trust him.
[01:47:40.210 --> 01:47:41.210]  What do you think?
[01:47:41.210 --> 01:47:45.610]  Well, I mean, the black pill, I think, is, which I originally kind of swallowed, but
[01:47:45.610 --> 01:47:48.130]  now he's really starting to butter me up a little bit.
[01:47:48.130 --> 01:47:51.990]  I mean, my Twitter is going gray and everything, people are allowed to say a lot of stuff on
[01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:53.849]  Twitter that they didn't used to be able to.
[01:47:53.849 --> 01:48:00.410]  Suddenly, Alex Jones videos are not, yeah, I've seen you, you know, in the end, he wants
[01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:01.410]  the Neuralink.
[01:48:01.410 --> 01:48:07.290]  And so it could all be a giant ruse to butter up the right wing, the Christians who want
[01:48:07.290 --> 01:48:12.009]  to be having free speech so they can come in and be like, oh, Elon's not a bad guy.
[01:48:12.009 --> 01:48:15.050]  He just wants to put a little brain interface in your head.
[01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:18.290]  And then once you get that brain interface at first, it's just going to be like, hey,
[01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:22.170]  you got you got this thing going on, you got that thing going next, it's going to be reminding
[01:48:22.170 --> 01:48:23.170]  you what to do.
[01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:26.690]  I have a friend who has one of those little Fitbit watches and he literally sits there
[01:48:26.690 --> 01:48:28.450]  like, oh, I got to do some steps.
[01:48:28.450 --> 01:48:31.730]  I was like, oh, my watch tells me I have to stand up and this guy actually does it.
[01:48:31.730 --> 01:48:33.410]  And this is not in his head.
[01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:38.530]  Like I foresee eventually when this thing goes with the whole AI bit by bit, people
[01:48:38.530 --> 01:48:41.530]  are going to give up part of their consciousness or like, I just want to be able to talk a
[01:48:41.530 --> 01:48:42.610]  little faster.
[01:48:42.610 --> 01:48:43.610]  I want to be a little.
[01:48:43.610 --> 01:48:44.610]  Here's the thing.
[01:48:44.610 --> 01:48:50.450]  I'm not an apologist for Elon, but his AI got unapproved and his brain chip got unapproved.
[01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:52.610]  Bill Gates is already way out ahead of it.
[01:48:52.610 --> 01:48:55.650]  So they're already rolling the chip out of the brain.
[01:48:55.650 --> 01:48:56.650]  It's Bill Gates.
[01:48:56.849 --> 01:49:01.090]  Well, I think I'd rather have Elon's if if I had to take a brain chip, I think I'd rather
[01:49:01.090 --> 01:49:02.090]  Elon's.
[01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:04.090]  I definitely don't want.
[01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:08.210]  I mean, why is Bill about 30 years ago, Bill Gates, his company was broken up for antitrust
[01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:09.210]  monopoly.
[01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:10.210]  Yeah.
[01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:11.210]  And now he runs our medical system.
[01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:12.769]  And then he wants to put a chip in our brain.
[01:49:12.769 --> 01:49:17.730]  And now imagine having a virus like a computer software virus in your brain that unless you
[01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:20.130]  pay him money, you can't shut that thing up.
[01:49:20.130 --> 01:49:22.929]  It's like you've got to go into the fray.
[01:49:22.929 --> 01:49:26.530]  What idiot would you go to the Microsoft place to get it done?
[01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:28.410]  Here's another thing about that.
[01:49:28.410 --> 01:49:30.690]  Imagine when they first came out with the cell phone, OK?
[01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:33.410]  Imagine getting a cell phone stapled to your head.
[01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:35.929]  And then like two weeks later, it's like, hey, I got the new iPhone.
[01:49:35.929 --> 01:49:37.530]  It's like, well, I can't get this.
[01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:39.330]  I got this thing stapled to my head.
[01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:41.690]  You know, you've got the brick attached to your head.
[01:49:41.690 --> 01:49:45.370]  But if they tell kids, hey, get the new phone stapled to your head, they'll do it.
[01:49:45.370 --> 01:49:46.370]  Exactly.
[01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:48.330]  And then, you know, you'll be starting to do better on tests.
[01:49:48.330 --> 01:49:50.969]  Maybe you can remember all the words you want to say in your podcast.
[01:49:50.969 --> 01:49:52.610]  Well, no, it'll just be without you.
[01:49:52.610 --> 01:49:55.210]  You're like, yeah, you're thinking like, what is the answer to this?
[01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:56.210]  Yeah.
[01:49:56.889 --> 01:50:01.849]  People say, I had this debate and they find me the left in it like six months ago.
[01:50:01.849 --> 01:50:07.290]  Until the Texas Instruments calculator in the 70s, people who had to do math, they didn't
[01:50:07.290 --> 01:50:08.290]  let us use those.
[01:50:08.290 --> 01:50:10.050]  When I was in school, I was good at math.
[01:50:10.050 --> 01:50:11.050]  Now I don't even know math.
[01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:13.410]  They go, well, you're afraid of a tool.
[01:50:13.410 --> 01:50:14.410]  No.
[01:50:14.410 --> 01:50:17.330]  But we have to understand some of these tools atrophy our minds.
[01:50:17.330 --> 01:50:18.330]  Yeah.
[01:50:18.330 --> 01:50:22.929]  And then if some cataclysm happens like a pole shift or a meteorite here or nuclear war and
[01:50:22.929 --> 01:50:26.809]  nobody can do math and nobody knows anything, it's going to be very hard.
[01:50:26.809 --> 01:50:28.090]  Nobody can navigate.
[01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:30.170]  Nobody really knows how to build stuff.
[01:50:30.170 --> 01:50:31.210]  Something that blows my mind.
[01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:36.050]  We have all this AutoCAD and all this ability to draw up these amazing buildings.
[01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:39.490]  We could be 3D rendering them out of milled out pieces on auto.
[01:50:39.490 --> 01:50:41.050]  But all they make is ugly boxes.
[01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:42.050]  Squares.
[01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:43.050]  Squares.
[01:50:43.050 --> 01:50:44.050]  You've got everything in the future.
[01:50:44.050 --> 01:50:47.809]  And meanwhile, back in the day, I don't know if it was Tartaria or what was going on, but
[01:50:47.809 --> 01:50:51.009]  these people are honing individual bricks that are perfectly symmetrical.
[01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:54.769]  Well, no, they admit that the stuff built in Italy cannot be built today.
[01:50:54.769 --> 01:50:55.769]  Yeah.
[01:50:55.769 --> 01:50:57.690]  The stuff in D.C. built a hundred years ago.
[01:50:57.690 --> 01:50:58.690]  They can't make it.
[01:50:58.690 --> 01:50:59.690]  Yeah.
[01:50:59.690 --> 01:51:00.690]  No one can.
[01:51:00.690 --> 01:51:01.690]  Yeah.
[01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:04.490]  Speaking of the building a new world, I wish that if we were living in a beautiful world
[01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:08.849]  that I want to build, it would be so nice if we would actually have some of these projects
[01:51:08.849 --> 01:51:09.849]  now.
[01:51:09.849 --> 01:51:14.769]  Like, can we build a fricking temple or something to show the skill that we've got, put ourselves
[01:51:14.769 --> 01:51:17.630]  to this project to build something beautiful?
[01:51:17.630 --> 01:51:21.950]  How can you be an architect and not want to sound like, you know, Mozart?
[01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:27.190]  Like anyone who plays piano or is a great musician wants to sound like the greats.
[01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:32.630]  These people become architects and then they just create giant hunks of crap and sell it
[01:51:32.630 --> 01:51:34.510]  like it's some kind of piece of art.
[01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:35.510]  It's crap.
[01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:41.230]  Well, they admit starting the 50s, CIA funded ugly art, ugly culture, because they don't
[01:51:41.230 --> 01:51:42.590]  want you to aspire.
[01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:43.590]  Yeah.
[01:51:43.590 --> 01:51:44.590]  Oppressive, ugly buildings.
[01:51:44.590 --> 01:51:46.969]  And it goes back to this little pot people.
[01:51:46.969 --> 01:51:50.650]  They're slowly getting you accumulated to the pot where it's like pretty much live in
[01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:51.650]  a pot already.
[01:51:51.650 --> 01:51:56.090]  I mean, these second backs that they're putting in down in San Diego, they literally are like
[01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:57.090]  pods.
[01:51:57.090 --> 01:51:58.530]  I mean, now they at least have a balcony.
[01:51:58.530 --> 01:52:03.849]  But I mean, who knows how long they're cutting the energy off, forcing you into it.
[01:52:03.849 --> 01:52:04.849]  It's good.
[01:52:04.849 --> 01:52:05.849]  Live in a pod.
[01:52:05.849 --> 01:52:09.290]  And in in San Diego, they're already saying you can't have a gas stove.
[01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:11.330]  It's already they're already putting stuff in for that.
[01:52:11.330 --> 01:52:12.730]  Meanwhile, they say it doesn't exist.
[01:52:12.730 --> 01:52:16.929]  And California rolls out fixed rate electric based on how much you earn.
[01:52:16.929 --> 01:52:17.929]  Yeah.
[01:52:17.929 --> 01:52:19.889]  That is the central bank digital currency.
[01:52:19.889 --> 01:52:21.370]  That's the social credit score.
[01:52:21.370 --> 01:52:22.370]  Exactly.
[01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:23.889]  And yeah, because, oh, you're poor.
[01:52:23.889 --> 01:52:25.230]  You're one of the lower class.
[01:52:25.230 --> 01:52:26.230]  You can do it.
[01:52:26.230 --> 01:52:27.530]  But it's like, oh, but with it comes strength.
[01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:28.530]  Yeah.
[01:52:28.530 --> 01:52:29.530]  But you didn't get vaccinated.
[01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:31.210]  And so you're you're a tax on society.
[01:52:31.210 --> 01:52:34.130]  So you don't actually get to participate in the program.
[01:52:34.130 --> 01:52:35.130]  Exactly.
[01:52:35.130 --> 01:52:36.130]  They're Cree.
[01:52:36.130 --> 01:52:40.530]  And they admit they white papers were going to give all these discounts to the poor.
[01:52:40.530 --> 01:52:41.530]  Right.
[01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:42.889]  They're going to sign up with conditions.
[01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:45.450]  No, everybody gets charged the same.
[01:52:45.450 --> 01:52:51.969]  And then they incentivize sucking like, man, I went off so hard at the show the other night.
[01:52:51.969 --> 01:52:53.809]  It was it was a blast.
[01:52:53.809 --> 01:52:57.969]  And I lost my phone and I had to get all my contacts and everything to go for the show
[01:52:57.969 --> 01:52:58.969]  on Monday.
[01:52:58.969 --> 01:53:00.969]  And I was like, oh, my God, I got to get this done.
[01:53:00.969 --> 01:53:06.010]  We go to a freaking Wal-Mart and the people in there.
[01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:07.769]  It was worse than idiocracy.
[01:53:07.769 --> 01:53:12.210]  I mean, everyone's like pushing computer screens, like, oh, it's not working, you know.
[01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:14.730]  I asked him, I said, can I buy a phone for me as I go?
[01:53:14.730 --> 01:53:15.889]  We don't have many phones.
[01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:16.889]  I go.
[01:53:16.889 --> 01:53:17.889]  I only need one phone.
[01:53:17.889 --> 01:53:18.889]  Can you show me the phones you have?
[01:53:18.889 --> 01:53:21.049]  Like, oh, we don't know how much they are.
[01:53:21.049 --> 01:53:22.730]  I think that's the other department.
[01:53:22.730 --> 01:53:25.130]  I mean, we were going around in circles for two hours.
[01:53:25.130 --> 01:53:26.570]  I was sitting there with money in my hand.
[01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:27.570]  I just want to buy a phone.
[01:53:27.570 --> 01:53:28.570]  I don't care.
[01:53:28.570 --> 01:53:29.730]  Just give me a describe.
[01:53:29.730 --> 01:53:31.929]  You were here for Tim Pool's podcast.
[01:53:31.929 --> 01:53:37.610]  They had a bunch, which is a revolution, because now it's not just comedy, it's live crowds
[01:53:38.450 --> 01:53:40.530]  I honestly felt, I don't know if it's been done before.
[01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:45.809]  I guess they've been doing stuff over there at the gas company, Vulcan Gas Company, for
[01:53:45.809 --> 01:53:47.330]  maybe one or two shows.
[01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:51.929]  But this idea of live podcasts, instead of all of us people who have been building this
[01:53:51.929 --> 01:53:56.530]  skill through COVID, basically, because it's fought forces in and we all built our little
[01:53:56.530 --> 01:53:58.849]  careers fighting against the system.
[01:53:58.849 --> 01:54:03.130]  Now it's actually time for us to come out of the basements and go into these arenas
[01:54:03.130 --> 01:54:06.849]  and actually mingle with the real people in the real world.
[01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:09.570]  It is going to be revolutionary.
[01:54:09.570 --> 01:54:12.929]  You can bring your friend now, instead of trying to get your friend to sit down and
[01:54:12.929 --> 01:54:15.290]  listen to the Alex Jones show might be tricky.
[01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:18.809]  But if you're like, dude, there's this thing and Joe Rogan and Alex Jones is going to
[01:54:18.809 --> 01:54:19.809]  be there.
[01:54:19.809 --> 01:54:22.330]  They're going to be like, yeah, I'll go to it with a couple of drinks.
[01:54:22.330 --> 01:54:23.330]  Go watch it.
[01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:26.690]  Next thing you know, slowly they're getting the truth bombs.
[01:54:26.690 --> 01:54:29.290]  They don't want us together like they want churches shut down.
[01:54:29.290 --> 01:54:31.849]  They don't want humans together having fun with ideas.
[01:54:31.849 --> 01:54:36.090]  And another really strong part about that, I think, is that, you know, I have had there
[01:54:36.090 --> 01:54:40.969]  was a few people there that I had probably I try not to get into like beefs with people
[01:54:40.969 --> 01:54:41.969]  on the right.
[01:54:41.969 --> 01:54:44.809]  But every once in a while you say a word, things get a lot of control and you have these
[01:54:44.809 --> 01:54:45.889]  little beefs.
[01:54:45.889 --> 01:54:49.730]  But when we were all there in the room together, I felt like all those little beefs went out
[01:54:49.730 --> 01:54:52.290]  the room and we became real people again.
[01:54:52.290 --> 01:54:56.929]  And we realized that we are this community of people and that are real humans that we
[01:54:56.929 --> 01:55:02.210]  can't just nitpick online and that they're probably our best bet to survival and getting
[01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:03.210]  out of this.
[01:55:03.210 --> 01:55:05.370]  I mean, I could foresee there being giant arenas.
[01:55:05.650 --> 01:55:09.290]  I mean, you've got comedians selling out like Wembley Stadium.
[01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:17.210]  Like to me, it's not beyond the pale to imagine podcasts going on tour and having massive,
[01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:18.210]  massive audiences.
[01:55:18.210 --> 01:55:19.210]  No, I agree.
[01:55:19.210 --> 01:55:20.730]  And that scares the system.
[01:55:20.730 --> 01:55:22.410]  And the globalists admit their own white papers.
[01:55:22.410 --> 01:55:23.410]  They're losing.
[01:55:23.410 --> 01:55:24.410]  Yeah.
[01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:27.969]  If you don't mind, I actually put a little plug here for the American Liberty Awards,
[01:55:27.969 --> 01:55:35.130]  which is actually going to be at the gas station, the Vulcan Gas Company on the 12th of August
[01:55:35.170 --> 01:55:38.849]  with Frank Cavanaugh, myself and Owen Shore is going to be there.
[01:55:38.849 --> 01:55:41.170]  Rob Dew is hosting it and it's going to be epic.
[01:55:41.170 --> 01:55:42.170]  If you go to.
[01:55:42.170 --> 01:55:43.170]  Well, I'll be there.
[01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:44.929]  He's going to be there.
[01:55:44.929 --> 01:55:45.929]  Yes.
[01:55:45.929 --> 01:55:46.929]  What's the date?
[01:55:46.929 --> 01:55:47.929]  August 12th.
[01:55:47.929 --> 01:55:48.929]  I'll be there.
[01:55:48.929 --> 01:55:49.929]  You're actually nominated.
[01:55:49.929 --> 01:55:50.929]  Believe it or not.
[01:55:50.929 --> 01:55:53.889]  I thought Alex would get nominated for an American Liberty Award.
[01:55:53.889 --> 01:55:56.849]  But yeah, it's going to be if you want tickets, get them ahead, because there's actually a
[01:55:56.849 --> 01:55:59.130]  special you get the early bird.
[01:55:59.130 --> 01:56:00.650]  It's like they all sell out there.
[01:56:00.650 --> 01:56:03.049]  The point is, that's where Joe Rogan was for two years.
[01:56:03.049 --> 01:56:06.130]  Now he's he got his own mothership next door.
[01:56:06.130 --> 01:56:08.090]  American Liberty Awards dot com.
[01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:09.090]  I'm done.
[01:56:09.090 --> 01:56:10.090]  All right.
[01:56:10.090 --> 01:56:11.090]  So what are you covering tomorrow?
[01:56:11.090 --> 01:56:16.290]  Because we got a big Sunday night live coming up with a bunch of special stuff right when
[01:56:16.290 --> 01:56:17.969]  the show ends in a minute and a half.
[01:56:17.969 --> 01:56:18.969]  What do you cover tomorrow?
[01:56:18.969 --> 01:56:19.969]  8 a.m.
[01:56:19.969 --> 01:56:20.969]  Doing Harrison Smith's American Journal.
[01:56:20.969 --> 01:56:24.450]  Well, I want to I want to kind of go into some of the things we talked about.
[01:56:24.450 --> 01:56:25.450]  I have a few articles.
[01:56:25.450 --> 01:56:28.530]  I also have a couple of guests that I'm going to get on.
[01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:31.530]  Allison Steinberg is going to be on.
[01:56:31.530 --> 01:56:32.530]  Hopefully I'm waiting for that one.
[01:56:33.010 --> 01:56:37.049]  Chris Sky and possibly Ian Smith still waiting to hear back tonight.
[01:56:37.049 --> 01:56:41.210]  And she's going to be going over the whole World War Three concept and what's going on
[01:56:41.210 --> 01:56:43.570]  with the transgender Sodom and Gomorrah world.
[01:56:43.570 --> 01:56:45.210]  Why are you racist against World War Three?
[01:56:45.210 --> 01:56:49.210]  I, you know, I'm just a white supremacist at heart, really.
[01:56:49.210 --> 01:56:53.809]  All right, white supremacist now, don't you think?
