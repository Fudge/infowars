[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:40.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.480 --> 00:47.760]  ladies and gentlemen we are live and broadcasting worldwide today there are no
[00:47.760 --> 00:54.040]  guests we're going to have open phones and cover masses of news we may have on
[00:54.040 --> 00:59.080]  the gun shop owner tattoo parlor owner and others that were right in the middle
[00:59.080 --> 01:02.920]  of the shops being looted and burned but no one burned them down because they
[01:02.920 --> 01:11.560]  stood out front their shops black white owners you name it with AR-15s and
[01:11.560 --> 01:19.200]  shotguns just like the Korean shopkeepers back in the LA riots and so the
[01:19.200 --> 01:28.160]  folks rioting there basically in a suburb of St. Louis were unable to rob
[01:28.160 --> 01:34.080]  that area again there's two different issues going on here did the police
[01:34.080 --> 01:39.480]  shoot a man with his hands up maybe don't forget Oscar Grant and other stories
[01:39.480 --> 01:43.880]  where they claimed he assaulted the officers and he had done no such thing
[01:43.880 --> 01:47.720]  and was in handcuffs on the ground and the cop pulled the gun out cold blooded
[01:47.720 --> 01:52.520]  at least shot him right in the back and then was later convicted only served a
[01:52.520 --> 01:56.480]  year and a half in prison the bullet went through his back hit the concrete
[01:56.480 --> 02:05.400]  bounced back up and went into his chest for a second time ricocheting back up
[02:05.400 --> 02:14.840]  into his body so I understand why people get upset by this I'm concerned
[02:14.840 --> 02:18.240]  about this the militarization of police where they're basically trained the
[02:18.240 --> 02:25.280]  public are terrorists in general and that does cause a lot of excessive force
[02:25.280 --> 02:30.120]  to be used there are a lot of mentally ill people that obviously gravitate
[02:30.120 --> 02:35.160]  towards sadistic activities and want the uniform and want the power that's a
[02:35.160 --> 02:39.000]  historic problem and more and more police departments especially in big
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.720]  cities are not trying to keep those people out and so that's why we're
[02:43.720 --> 02:50.360]  seeing things like this intensify it's basically a power grab like we saw back
[02:50.360 --> 02:56.280]  a few years ago with the Boston bombing it was a citizen that caught the Patsy
[02:56.280 --> 03:01.800]  sleeping in the boat outside the cordon area where one half of Boston was
[03:01.800 --> 03:09.080]  searched and black people white people you name it that had no resemblance to
[03:09.080 --> 03:15.800]  the Zarnab brother they were looking for we're being pulled out of their houses
[03:15.800 --> 03:22.640]  pulled out of their cars at gunpoint in a giant police state or G power grab and
[03:22.640 --> 03:26.400]  it's time for the system to stop denying that we're moving into the
[03:26.400 --> 03:32.800]  authoritarian to Talitarian model they denied the NSA was spying now it's all
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.440]  admitted they denied so many other things they've denied that they were
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.480]  adding things to vaccines part of Trojan horse secret programs they've been
[03:41.480 --> 03:46.680]  caught over and over again they said that smart meters wouldn't track what you
[03:46.680 --> 03:51.600]  did wouldn't control the temperature in your house now they admit they do this
[03:51.600 --> 03:56.280]  is part of a revolution by criminal elements in government and major
[03:56.280 --> 04:02.440]  corporations that interface with it to dominate and control society and manage
[04:02.440 --> 04:09.560]  the population like we're a bunch of cattle aka a soylent green and this
[04:09.560 --> 04:15.000]  whole broadcast is simply about getting people to think outside of the box and to
[04:15.000 --> 04:22.840]  be made aware of that so that is our main mission so we're gonna get into the
[04:22.840 --> 04:30.240]  situation unfolding in st. Louis and surrounding areas because it's a
[04:30.240 --> 04:34.400]  microcosm of what's gonna unfold on a wider scale in this country we're gonna
[04:34.400 --> 04:39.720]  get into kill switch smartphone bill passes in California we're gonna break
[04:39.720 --> 04:44.200]  down the knockout game where blacks are physically attacked white people you
[04:44.200 --> 04:48.080]  don't see whites out burning down black neighborhoods because of that we're
[04:48.080 --> 04:53.240]  gonna look at how MSNBC and others have promoted this thug racist culture and
[04:53.240 --> 04:58.480]  then we're also gonna look at Gardasil shots killing more people stay with us
[04:58.480 --> 05:02.280]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my
[05:02.280 --> 05:07.080]  family so much get healthy and detoxified most people know that iodine
[05:07.080 --> 05:12.440]  deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so many of the

[08:27.800 --> 08:52.800]  Well here we are on Tuesday the 12th day already of August 2014 I am your host
[08:52.800 --> 08:59.280]  Alex Jones and we're gonna be here Lord willing for the next three hours ladies
[08:59.280 --> 09:04.040]  and gentlemen we will have open phones throughout the three hours you know I
[09:04.040 --> 09:10.160]  was thinking about the folks that have been rioting in Ferguson and in areas of
[09:10.160 --> 09:15.760]  South St. Louis who've been burning down shops and businesses and grocery
[09:15.760 --> 09:22.000]  stores and mini-marts and homes and I realized that they're only following the
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.680]  example of the US federal government because if a police officer did shoot a
[09:29.680 --> 09:37.480]  18-year-old black man in cold blood with his hands up as witnesses say which
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.120]  certainly has happened before and is happening with more frequency because of
[09:42.120 --> 09:49.600]  instinctive shooting training mainly if that is the case it makes total sense
[09:49.600 --> 09:58.000]  because if the police kill someone who's innocent you don't go attack the police
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.480]  station you don't go try to burn down the police station or burn down police
[10:02.480 --> 10:06.680]  cars or attack police by the way I'm not endorsing that I'm just saying
[10:06.680 --> 10:12.600]  hypothetically no no no you burn up your own neighborhood and any shops that
[10:12.600 --> 10:21.840]  are white owned that will certainly certainly show them and how are they
[10:21.840 --> 10:26.280]  taking their cue from the federal government actually from George Walker
[10:26.280 --> 10:41.360]  Bush well it's just like supposedly 15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi
[10:41.360 --> 10:48.080]  Arabia but we attacked their arch enemy Iraq and then overthrew the government
[10:48.080 --> 10:54.560]  and have armed now Saudi Arabian backed Al Qaeda Wahhabist from Saudi Arabia to
[10:54.560 --> 11:02.680]  take it over so I guess actually they're not taking a total cue from the federal
[11:02.680 --> 11:07.800]  government where Saudi Arabia attacks us so we attack Saudi Arabia's enemy and
[11:07.800 --> 11:12.520]  blame them for it this is where the cops reportedly shoot an innocent person and
[11:12.520 --> 11:19.600]  then the people burned down part of their own neighborhood because to actually
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.880]  mimic our government the blacks would protest a fellow black person being
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.720]  killed in cold blood by shooting a bunch of innocent blacks because that's kind of
[11:29.720 --> 11:34.480]  what happened with 9-11 if you believe the official story Saudi Arabia was
[11:34.480 --> 11:38.720]  involved clearly they were at some level and so you attack the country that was
[11:38.720 --> 11:44.320]  not involved so actually that's not a fair analogy is it because the blacks in
[11:44.320 --> 11:52.760]  St. Louis and in Ferguson would have to just randomly kill black people and they'd
[11:52.760 --> 11:56.680]  have to kill about a million five hundred thousand because I keep using the
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.280]  million number that was from the sanctions and the first year of the war
[12:01.280 --> 12:08.200]  from 1990 to 2007 it was over a million one of the British Medical Journal that
[12:08.200 --> 12:14.400]  did the analysis of the Lanzid and others did breakdowns it's about a million
[12:14.400 --> 12:20.960]  and a half now so actually you know you'd have to kill I guess every black
[12:20.960 --> 12:25.600]  person in St. Louis to make it something comparable kill up you know fifty
[12:25.600 --> 12:29.000]  hundred thousand black people they'd have to kill a fifty hundred thousand of
[12:29.000 --> 12:36.320]  their own people to to to actually be as cockamamie and crazy and off the wall
[12:36.320 --> 12:42.320]  as the propaganda that we accept in this country and if you're having trouble
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.320]  wrapping your mind around that gibberish that I just spent four minutes
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.920]  putting out hey don't don't blame me I'm putting out the twisted backwards
[12:51.920 --> 12:59.440]  upside down bizarro world satanic logic of the globalist of course there's
[12:59.440 --> 13:07.440]  really no logic at all except destabilization and power-grabbing that's
[13:07.440 --> 13:15.360]  what's happening because our government for four years basically has about keep
[13:15.360 --> 13:19.120]  saying three years about four years now has been funding Al Qaeda rebels in
[13:19.120 --> 13:28.960]  Libya and in Egypt and in Iraq and in Syria to take over areas build a
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.680]  command base to then threaten the West with all the stinger missiles they've
[13:32.680 --> 13:37.880]  got so they can then set up police states in the Western world to counter the
[13:37.880 --> 13:48.600]  people that publicly work for them and again where's the logic of that the
[13:48.600 --> 14:02.760]  federal government the CIA publicly publicly funded Al Qaeda to go in and
[14:02.760 --> 14:08.640]  take over Libya they did the same thing in a whole bunch of other countries and
[14:08.640 --> 14:12.440]  now they're acting like they don't know why ISIS is running wild take over
[14:12.440 --> 14:16.600]  Kurdish areas where they're not supposed to be see they're painting outside the
[14:16.600 --> 14:21.360]  lines they're not painting by the numbers so they've y'all got to be bombed
[14:21.360 --> 14:27.480]  to go back into the areas where they're allowed to be forming their new state out
[14:27.480 --> 14:34.880]  of Western Iraq into Eastern Syria and I know I talk a lot about this because
[14:34.880 --> 14:40.960]  it's it's it's an unfolding tragedy and it's a war crime because it's bigger
[14:40.960 --> 14:46.760]  than just what's happening with Al Qaeda it's an illustration of everything the
[14:46.760 --> 14:52.000]  globalists do where they create the crisis create the terror group turn them
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.840]  loose and then let them basically take over society and then poses saviors to
[14:56.840 --> 15:05.400]  them counter them so we're going to look back at the Bart police shooting of
[15:05.400 --> 15:10.240]  Oscar Grant where the police said that he had assaulted them they had video of
[15:10.240 --> 15:14.880]  it but the truth is he didn't resist they put him down on his stomach and shot
[15:14.880 --> 15:18.920]  him through the back through his heart and then they tried to grab everybody's
[15:18.920 --> 15:27.000]  cell phones so that no one could document it the trouble was someone hid
[15:27.000 --> 15:38.440]  behind a seat in a train and got the execution on video and it doesn't matter
[15:38.440 --> 15:46.160]  if you're a poor poor white appellation white or a poor inner-city black the
[15:46.160 --> 15:52.760]  attitude is you can basically be executed and nobody gets in trouble and
[15:52.760 --> 15:58.560]  more and more of the police are being turned into a paramilitary to basically
[15:58.560 --> 16:01.960]  wage war on who they've been trained their enemy is and that's the American
[16:01.960 --> 16:07.040]  people now a lot of departments have resisted this but a lot of departments
[16:07.040 --> 16:14.760]  have succumbed to it and everyone needs to understand that when they're done
[16:14.760 --> 16:20.480]  setting the precedent on poor people of getting away with this it's going to be
[16:20.480 --> 16:25.120]  moved against the real target gun owners returning veterans veterans
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.560]  libertarians Christians conservatives because that's who this is really being
[16:30.560 --> 16:36.600]  prepared for and I always told you that and now it's public Obama said two days
[16:36.600 --> 16:42.120]  ago on Sunday in a New York Times article that the main threat is
[16:42.120 --> 16:46.600]  conservatives and the fact that we won't compromise and that we've radicalized
[16:46.600 --> 16:51.240]  the media when he says conservatives he says the radicals that have taken it
[16:51.240 --> 16:57.440]  over the Tea Party that's the libertarian 1776ers who understand the
[16:57.440 --> 17:02.000]  battle space understand the game understand what's being done understand
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.240]  the big picture of course we're the enemy because we know the globalist we
[17:08.240 --> 17:13.600]  know their game plan we study them and we want prosperity we want stability we
[17:13.600 --> 17:20.840]  want the police to be constitutional and respected and to be guardians with the
[17:20.840 --> 17:27.080]  people of society locally controlled we want the citizens to have jobs and
[17:27.080 --> 17:33.120]  prosperity and have an age of chivalry return and a new renaissance we want to
[17:33.120 --> 17:40.000]  have a nation of quality and honor a nation of strong male and female role
[17:40.000 --> 17:46.040]  models and strong families we want what works and the globalist have infected
[17:46.040 --> 17:54.480]  society with cultural psychological warfare viruses on record to break up
[17:54.480 --> 17:59.400]  the family to degenerate art and society it's all been declassified just type in
[17:59.400 --> 18:04.920]  CIA put out deviant art and pornography and promoted the legalization of
[18:04.920 --> 18:08.400]  hardcore pornography and I'm not up here on some high horse saying you know that
[18:08.400 --> 18:11.960]  I haven't been around the block the whole point is is that we know where this
[18:11.960 --> 18:19.040]  all came from to sear the conscience show that when real things are going on
[18:19.040 --> 18:23.560]  that are bad we are so desensitized we don't get up and resist it I talk a lot
[18:23.560 --> 18:28.480]  about my grandfather who was in two tours in World War two one in aircraft and
[18:28.480 --> 18:32.760]  after he was down with his missions on the ground in Italy and then in Germany
[18:32.760 --> 18:40.600]  and saw starving children piles of dead bodies the whole nine yards and he was a
[18:40.600 --> 18:47.280]  man's man very popular you know elected into government but he would not watch
[18:47.280 --> 18:52.080]  violent television or violent movies and it wasn't because he couldn't handle it
[18:52.080 --> 18:56.600]  it was because it was insulting to have seen a lot of real dead people and a lot
[18:56.600 --> 19:05.520]  of dead bodies and a lot of starving children and and and then to to see it
[19:05.520 --> 19:13.720]  turned into a joke on television he wouldn't let my dad and his brother go
[19:13.720 --> 19:18.840]  go see violent films and if they were in a violent film he'd get up and take them
[19:18.840 --> 19:25.120]  out of it and it wasn't because he was a wimp you know he'd been a boxer and then
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.480]  it had been put in a military academy and everything else before he even was
[19:29.480 --> 19:37.600]  sent off the Army Air Corps but he he understood it was offensive because the
[19:37.600 --> 19:42.240]  image of violence the image of sex all it does in the study show this is
[19:42.240 --> 19:49.800]  desensitized you from the real thing it ruins real sex for you and then it
[19:49.800 --> 19:53.000]  desensitizes violence where you don't care about your neighbor getting killed
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.400]  or drug off you already saw that on television a thousand times last month
[19:56.400 --> 20:01.840]  it's brainwashing it seems that everywhere you turn to these days people
[20:01.840 --> 20:05.440]  are talking about the health benefits of silver but don't be fooled into

[24:31.760 --> 24:38.520]  from television in 1997 where Charlton Heston narrates discussing
[24:38.520 --> 24:43.600]  psiops against populations so that's coming up in the next segment we'll
[24:43.600 --> 24:55.960]  dovetail it with all of the latest economic and military news this morning I
[24:55.960 --> 25:07.240]  got physically angry and I was very happy that I had the emotional response of
[25:07.240 --> 25:14.920]  becoming nauseous at the thought and at first having a feeling of powerlessness
[25:14.920 --> 25:20.200]  because that was my brain trying to figure out how to get out of it how to
[25:20.200 --> 25:26.600]  defeat it how to gain power over it how to protect the species how to protect the
[25:26.600 --> 25:38.720]  continuity of the genetics I had some friends over this morning for breakfast
[25:38.720 --> 25:47.640]  and one of them was a former nanny to my children who is pregnant and getting
[25:47.640 --> 25:57.640]  married people just dropped by for 45 minute long breakfast and even though
[25:57.640 --> 26:05.160]  I've known this person for about six years and she's smart she goes well we're
[26:05.160 --> 26:11.120]  gonna do some of the vaccines we think but not all of them and I sat back and
[26:11.120 --> 26:18.560]  got on the computer on a laptop and was showing her mainline documents where
[26:18.560 --> 26:22.680]  there's cancer viruses in most of the vaccines where polio actually gives
[26:22.680 --> 26:27.440]  people polio worldwide mainstream headlines but they call it paralysis
[26:27.440 --> 26:32.280]  where they shot black people up for 47 years and kept it secret with cephalus
[26:32.280 --> 26:35.480]  and allowed them to spread it to hundreds of thousands of people killing
[26:35.480 --> 26:39.560]  tens of thousands and just well-known stuff and she's like oh I did know about
[26:39.560 --> 26:43.840]  that and I said yeah watch this news clip just from last week I see one of
[26:43.840 --> 26:48.520]  these every few weeks without looking and it's always a local newscast it
[26:48.520 --> 26:55.040]  never makes it nationally we're a 12 or 11 year old girl takes the Gardasil shot
[26:55.040 --> 27:02.080]  the HPV and dies she goes oh yeah I know a lot of women that have gotten real
[27:02.080 --> 27:07.480]  sick from that or their daughters have oh no I'd never take that and I go so you
[27:07.480 --> 27:12.280]  do know that's Pat and I go do you remember Rick Perry saying it was the
[27:12.280 --> 27:15.600]  law you had to take it she goes yeah there were TV commercials with him
[27:15.600 --> 27:19.800]  saying it's the law and so my head starts spinning I want to get those
[27:19.800 --> 27:24.320]  videos again I want to warn people I get physically angry at a government lying
[27:24.320 --> 27:28.760]  and saying it's the law when there was no law knowing it killed a bunch of
[27:28.760 --> 27:33.400]  people during the trials because that's what it has I mean to be able to
[27:33.400 --> 27:38.560]  sterilize you a large portion of women that take it of course it attacks the
[27:38.560 --> 27:45.120]  ovaries that's now been confirmed for that to happen sometimes it's gonna have
[27:45.120 --> 27:54.800]  a bigger effect and kill you and it just hit me how evil this system is and the
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.000]  eugenicist and all their documents and eco science and all the admissions and
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.400]  I had to sit there for 45 minutes and ruin what would have been a nice
[28:02.400 --> 28:13.120]  breakfast as we sat there eating steak and eggs and bell peppers and onions just
[28:13.120 --> 28:19.440]  pulling stuff up and then my buddy that came over my personal trainer he never
[28:19.440 --> 28:22.880]  even told me all this if he goes yeah my cousin you know the you know my aunt
[28:22.880 --> 28:29.680]  total natural organic homeschooled kids never got sick super healthy then he
[28:29.680 --> 28:36.280]  got into the army academy gave a bunch of shots six months in a coma brain
[28:36.280 --> 28:40.040]  damage has to take pills every day now from the shots the army gave them and
[28:40.040 --> 28:44.880]  they admit the shots did it and then the other person that was there started
[28:44.880 --> 28:47.800]  talking about people they knew that had been damaged and then my grandmother says
[28:47.800 --> 28:52.480]  she got polio too except for getting it and it's been on crutches ever since it's
[28:52.480 --> 28:58.200]  still alive at 89 and I just realized I've become too comfortable with this and
[28:58.200 --> 29:02.080]  the doctors are compartmentalized the nurses are compartmentalized I mean
[29:02.080 --> 29:08.040]  we I'm the one that broke that they're secretly taking blood at birth for 43
[29:08.040 --> 29:11.840]  years and by the way when I say that I don't get a thrill that I broke that I
[29:11.840 --> 29:18.280]  get nauseous and angry like I'm caught in a dog pile playing football with 10
[29:18.280 --> 29:22.320]  big guys on me and I can't breathe and I can't get out of it because I know I've
[29:22.320 --> 29:26.920]  gotten out of stuff before I've moved the world before and I know I've got the
[29:26.920 --> 29:30.280]  power to reach out to you to move the lever is after that broke with all these
[29:30.280 --> 29:35.240]  lawsuits global phenomenon it's now known and I'm just know we can get the

[33:17.240 --> 33:23.960]  America your government is in control defending the Republic from enemies
[33:23.960 --> 33:31.040]  foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones I want to try to tie everything here
[33:31.040 --> 33:37.520]  together I haven't talked about Robin Williams death yet I like Robin Williams
[33:37.520 --> 33:41.720]  I thought he was a great actor and I'm sad that it looks like he committed
[33:41.720 --> 33:49.360]  suicide by hanging but then I look at the headlines report Robin Williams had
[33:49.360 --> 33:54.640]  serious money troubles this is guy that made hundreds of millions of dollars and
[33:54.640 --> 34:02.640]  he was worried about faltering career Fox News is reporting and radar online
[34:02.640 --> 34:14.120]  well stories are up on drudgereport.com and I think about that if Robin
[34:14.120 --> 34:22.280]  Williams would have been more worried about helping other people if Robin
[34:22.280 --> 34:27.120]  Williams would have been more worried about discovering the wonders of the
[34:27.120 --> 34:33.720]  universe and loving his friends and family and not been depressed about a
[34:33.720 --> 34:41.400]  faltering career and money troubles he would probably be alive today and I
[34:41.400 --> 34:45.760]  don't fault him for committing suicide that's his business and I don't speak
[34:45.760 --> 34:52.360]  ill of the dead if they've not been a rapacious person
[34:52.360 --> 35:03.000]  but Robin Williams clearly went along with the establishment line and Robin
[35:03.000 --> 35:12.400]  Williams was obviously a worldly person and it shows I would understand
[35:12.400 --> 35:17.280]  someone committing suicide if they had incredibly painful bone cancer and if
[35:17.280 --> 35:23.160]  they just started taking enough morphine to fade off I don't think the state
[35:23.160 --> 35:26.360]  should be involved in that though because then they'll start killing people
[35:26.360 --> 35:34.040]  that are healthy which has already begun in northern and western Europe but I
[35:34.040 --> 35:41.640]  think about the Hollywood people that I've known on average they are completely
[35:41.640 --> 35:49.520]  and absolutely unhappy despite the fact they own private jets date the most
[35:49.520 --> 35:55.240]  beautiful women and have the world at their feet they are some of the most
[35:55.240 --> 36:03.000]  empty unhappy people you will ever know the only people I know that are
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.600]  celebrities that are happy are people that have moved out of LA and don't
[36:08.600 --> 36:15.040]  want anything to do with it Mike judge is a happy guy but he's an engineer and
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.840]  loves comedy and just loves to go listen to good music and have fun and he's
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.640]  totally down to earth and he's a producer and made a more than a billion
[36:23.640 --> 36:31.040]  dollars by the way Mike's in town I just I just was too tired last night to go
[36:31.040 --> 36:34.560]  out but I might go out tonight I need to give him a call not name dropping I'm
[36:34.560 --> 36:45.280]  just giving you an example Silicon Valley King of the Hill office space movies
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.400]  like that Jesse Ventura overalls a happy guy because he likes to exercise
[36:49.400 --> 36:53.360]  likes to fish likes to take care of his family likes to golf who care less about
[36:53.360 --> 37:01.280]  being a celebrity and I guess I've known a few other people but but those are
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.560]  names I can't mention on air that are celebrities and are happy but you look
[37:06.560 --> 37:11.160]  at consciousness itself and and and the fact that we can see beauty and share
[37:11.160 --> 37:18.800]  beauty with others and all the studies show it helping others teaching others
[37:18.800 --> 37:27.440]  there's more than one way to live forever we're told there's immortality and
[37:27.440 --> 37:33.920]  we're told there is replication and the only form of immortality that we know
[37:33.920 --> 37:40.280]  for a hundred percent fact we have is replication but we know pure replication
[37:40.280 --> 37:51.360]  always leads into errors and stagnation and so that's why in a competition based
[37:51.360 --> 37:58.600]  system in the species males and females compete in art and literature and
[37:58.600 --> 38:06.600]  physical prowess in beauty in physical accumulation to heighten the development
[38:06.600 --> 38:15.040]  of genetic models that build and complement the species the globalist
[38:15.040 --> 38:20.320]  model though is one of physically trying to go into the DNA and the
[38:20.320 --> 38:29.920]  mitochondrial DNA and irrevocably mutating and sabotaging it to cause
[38:29.920 --> 38:37.080]  degenerative mutations and to not even cause mutations that statistically are
[38:37.080 --> 38:44.360]  known to create traits that could be desirable or desirous like the
[38:44.360 --> 38:51.920]  mutation of the Ice Age humanoid Homo sapiens sapien that you're looking at on
[38:51.920 --> 39:00.600]  your television screen right now that would be culturally worldwide desirous
[39:05.440 --> 39:13.400]  and why do I speak about these things because if you don't look at the world
[39:13.400 --> 39:18.920]  through the perspective of the technocrats you are living in a matrix
[39:18.920 --> 39:26.040]  and that's what I'm here to tell you all this other news is simply a facade
[39:26.040 --> 39:32.760]  within the continuum of the manipulation and the public is now awake to the fact
[39:32.760 --> 39:37.560]  that there is a manipulation and social engineering going on but they're not
[39:37.560 --> 39:47.160]  awake to what the social engineering is trying to do and this morning I call it
[39:47.160 --> 39:52.400]  a flashback but it's not really that it's bringing up the data the legions of
[39:52.400 --> 40:04.760]  examples of premeditated admitted ongoing current and past testing of
[40:04.760 --> 40:14.320]  degenerative and even lethal chemical biological radiological nanotech
[40:15.560 --> 40:22.800]  programming into humanity in an ongoing total assault and we have all the metric
[40:22.800 --> 40:30.080]  graphs to show the devastation that it is causing and to know that we're all
[40:30.080 --> 40:35.840]  part of an experiment by a super elite to develop life extension technologies
[40:35.840 --> 40:42.480]  for themselves but to also decide which way they want to mutate whether it will
[40:42.480 --> 40:51.080]  be biological or electrochemical or purely silicon or an augmented meshing
[40:51.080 --> 41:02.080]  of the silicon with the electrochemical biological species and that's why I
[41:02.080 --> 41:06.600]  drive up to a checkpoint with cops and riot gear I mean it might as well be
[41:06.600 --> 41:15.480]  pig means you know playing with their tallywhackers I mean I just I am from
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.160]  the perspective of the technocrats except I don't want to hurt them I see
[41:20.160 --> 41:29.200]  how they're being manipulated following a programming system I see how the
[41:29.200 --> 41:35.320]  public's being manipulated I see all the different angles and I simply want the
[41:35.320 --> 41:39.720]  public to not believe me but to take the red pill step back and see it for
[41:39.720 --> 41:44.160]  themselves and then it's all a joke but to even communicate with the public I've
[41:44.160 --> 41:52.080]  got to go in and model things and and and cover news most of the time from a
[41:52.080 --> 41:59.680]  substratta of the controlled paradigm to even try to get through to someone it's
[41:59.680 --> 42:04.560]  like going into the matrix jacking in and telling Neo in the first 10 minutes
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.960]  of the film this is all fake I can't really explain it to you need to take
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.920]  this red pill but remember this is gonna freak you out and and all I'm off
[42:13.920 --> 42:19.760]  rings the truth nothing more but it is within that great truth coming out of
[42:19.760 --> 42:25.320]  Plato's cave the allegory of the cave that you are alive and that your
[42:25.320 --> 42:32.560]  consciousness and your awareness flowers into a fractal paradigm of expanded
[42:32.560 --> 42:37.400]  understanding that is limitless
[42:37.400 --> 42:52.280]  and then you come face to face with the realization that the elite are a hundred
[42:52.280 --> 42:58.640]  percent on this page but have made the decision to wall off 99 plus percent of
[42:58.640 --> 43:05.240]  the public and that they are on a power trip because even though they're
[43:05.240 --> 43:09.520]  intellectually smart and scientifically smart they don't have heart they don't
[43:09.520 --> 43:20.720]  have soul they are they are so wicked that it seems to them the evil course is
[43:20.720 --> 43:27.000]  the surest course and you can clearly see out a few hundred steps that that
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.080]  there's no way they're ever gonna get out of this or be successful with the
[43:32.080 --> 43:43.600]  wavelength paradigm spirit that they have released the spirit the wavelength
[43:43.600 --> 43:52.280]  the spirit of the age the the essence of the technology they're using the
[43:52.280 --> 44:00.840]  cultural twisted mathematics is a virus that will not build what they tell
[44:00.840 --> 44:06.200]  themselves they're building it's building a nightmare
[44:09.480 --> 44:20.840]  and then it hit me the conspiracy the criminal racketeering of the state of
[44:20.840 --> 44:35.400]  Texas in 19 in in in 2007 2006 in the Gardasil HPV trials with Merck and all
[44:35.400 --> 44:40.560]  the deaths and autoimmune disorders and sterilization that was happening it was
[44:40.560 --> 44:47.840]  in the journals in the local news their answer was to triple down and to come out
[44:47.840 --> 44:54.400]  and say it's the law you've got to take this vaccine or mothers you'll be
[44:54.400 --> 45:00.040]  arrested your daughters won't get cancer even though the cancer is extremely
[45:00.040 --> 45:06.560]  rare the vaccine insert says it doesn't protect you and we knew was going to be
[45:06.560 --> 45:09.560]  linked to sterilization because it already done that in a lot of the trials
[45:09.560 --> 45:15.400]  and they went on the air and said it was the law and ran TV ads which became the
[45:15.400 --> 45:19.840]  model in India and Mexico and everywhere else and everywhere after the
[45:19.840 --> 45:23.200]  first few rounds there they outlawed it in India because they went and studied
[45:23.200 --> 45:27.360]  it in the local news and national news said no it's a sterile it and the
[45:27.360 --> 45:30.480]  government got in trouble for that over there I mean it's admitted what it's
[45:30.480 --> 45:33.880]  doing and then I've got to sit there with someone that's known me for six
[45:33.880 --> 45:39.400]  years and convince them not to take it or not to give it to their child and now
[45:39.400 --> 45:51.800]  they're giving it to little boys and it just shows how deep we are in this
[45:51.800 --> 45:57.400]  whole thing the cops give it to their kids the bureaucrats give it to them the
[45:57.400 --> 46:01.720]  FBI agents go give it to their daughters and you all think you're part of the
[46:01.720 --> 46:06.080]  power structure you're being murdered on record it's like fluoride it's in
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.960]  thousands of studies 26 studies looked at by Harvard in 2012 just type in
[46:11.960 --> 46:16.000]  Harvard study fluoride where if you drink it for a couple years when you're a
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.840]  child it lowers your IQ more than 10 points and it gives you a seven-fold
[46:21.840 --> 46:26.280]  increase in bone cancer and a bunch of other stuff adrenal failure kidney
[46:26.280 --> 46:36.960]  failure liver cancer I mean my god absolute fact and it's on a laugh or
[46:36.960 --> 46:43.480]  cry when some bureaucrat comes banging on our door and says I'm from the state
[46:43.480 --> 46:49.000]  I'm here to inspect your office for this or that and is on a power trip I mean
[46:49.000 --> 46:54.920]  I'm literally looking at a brain damaged creature brought up on television their
[46:54.920 --> 46:59.200]  whole life on a petty power trip who drank fluoride their whole life and just
[46:59.200 --> 47:03.880]  wants a bigger truck or a fancier house or you know operates at an animal level
[47:03.880 --> 47:09.760]  of hating their their supervisor and I'm sitting there on a on a whole
[47:09.760 --> 47:15.960]  another level not on a power trip in sadness at a wrecked creature realizing
[47:15.960 --> 47:21.720]  though that it is a piranha and a servant of the system that destroyed them
[47:21.720 --> 47:30.720]  and shuttered the doors of perception and their consciousness I mean I've seen
[47:30.720 --> 47:36.640]  hundreds of local newscasts in the last seven eight years nine years with
[47:36.640 --> 47:41.320]  Gardasil hundreds we've aired probably 50 of them here until the point that I'm
[47:41.320 --> 47:46.680]  conditioned to where I don't even get upset about it anymore and don't even
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.560]  talk about it when Rob Dukos look another girl died from Gardasil sometimes
[47:51.560 --> 47:54.600]  the doctors admit oh yeah you had a bad reaction other times they go oh we don't
[47:54.600 --> 47:57.880]  know why we gave it to you died you know in the clinic or died in the car on the
[47:57.880 --> 48:04.720]  way home or died the next day and then of course the sudden death infant
[48:04.720 --> 48:09.400]  syndrome they've confirmed in Australia and Japan that's why they don't give
[48:09.400 --> 48:15.080]  baby shots before 18 months in Japan that you give a baby you know a few
[48:15.080 --> 48:18.960]  dozen shots they have an autoimmune response their blood they have an
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.720]  aneurysm their their brain bleeds and you come in and babies in a common and
[48:22.720 --> 48:29.120]  baby dies it was only meant to brain damage your child so they would be one
[48:29.120 --> 48:34.320]  of these zombies but you know to be strong enough to do that especially with
[48:34.320 --> 48:38.440]  little boys little boys aren't as strong as little girls that's the same in all
[48:38.440 --> 48:44.040]  mammal species from whales to racists monkeys to homo sapiens sapiens
[48:44.040 --> 48:51.320]  girls are more hearty that's a genetic design to be able to handle childbirth
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.560]  any medical doctor will pay that believe you go on your little boys got blood
[48:55.560 --> 48:59.200]  coming out his nose and the police officers are gonna take you to jail
[48:59.200 --> 49:05.040]  and indict you because the state the cops don't know that they were murdered
[49:05.040 --> 49:09.080]  by the state and the cops see a little baby with blood come out its nose they
[49:09.080 --> 49:15.560]  want you know and the hospital's gonna say that you shook your baby because you
[49:15.560 --> 49:23.560]  see if that lie falls if we admit the fluoride's hurting us if we admit the
[49:23.560 --> 49:27.680]  shots are designed to brain damages then it all the rest of it caves in see so
[49:27.680 --> 49:34.640]  they have to say you shook your baby they only admit it when your child dies at
[49:34.640 --> 49:38.760]  the doctor or on the way home or is old enough where they can't blame you let's
[49:38.760 --> 49:43.440]  go to a short clip from the local news piece this is up on info wars.com from
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.840]  Wisconsin WTM J and you see the image this little 12 year old girl she doesn't
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.200]  get to get married she didn't get to have kids she doesn't get to go to Cancun
[49:52.200 --> 49:56.560]  she doesn't get to see the stars at night that are big and bright she's dead
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.640]  now let's go to the clip so what caused the 12 year old's life to be cut so
[50:01.640 --> 50:06.680]  tragically short a few hours before she died Meredith was complaining of a sore
[50:06.680 --> 50:11.440]  throat her mom took her to the doctor while there the 12 year old also got
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.680]  the first round of the HPV vaccine when I came home she had just thrown up and
[50:16.680 --> 50:24.040]  was not responsive on my living room floor hmm I performed CPR and she was
[50:24.040 --> 50:31.880]  taken to Waukesha Memorial where she died and by the way until six years ago
[50:31.880 --> 50:35.240]  pregnant women were never supposed to take shots any doctor will tell you that
[50:35.240 --> 50:39.640]  they knew that it caused all sorts of problems and until six years ago you
[50:39.640 --> 50:43.600]  never gave someone that was already sick of vaccine was well known to cause
[50:43.600 --> 50:49.840]  autoimmune problems and and and brainstem death probably what happened to
[50:49.840 --> 50:56.480]  her and women will still take their daughters in for execution so just

[52:07.000 --> 52:11.040]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[52:11.040 --> 52:15.280]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[52:15.280 --> 52:19.160]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[52:19.160 --> 52:23.360]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[52:23.360 --> 52:27.200]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[52:27.200 --> 52:30.600]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[52:30.600 --> 52:34.320]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[54:35.080 --> 54:40.280]  successful and a long life but will anybody mourn for the 12-year-old
[54:40.280 --> 54:46.880]  girl Meredith had a zest for life and it showed in her picture she was active
[54:46.880 --> 54:51.480]  and healthy but now her family is trying to figure out what tragically cut their
[54:51.480 --> 54:57.480]  daughter's life short and for every story of a death there's hundreds of the
[54:57.480 --> 55:04.320]  wheelchairs and the blood pouring out from the sexual organ and from the
[55:04.320 --> 55:10.960]  eyeballs and it doesn't matter how many people die how many get sterilized or
[55:10.960 --> 55:19.680]  how many foreign countries banned Gardasil America will take it because the
[55:19.680 --> 55:24.080]  high priest up on the mountain said you must do it the medical doctor and the
[55:24.080 --> 55:28.240]  medical doctors can never admit this is happening because then what does it say
[55:28.240 --> 55:32.440]  about their whole profession that they're just big pharma pushers oh and
[55:32.440 --> 55:37.480]  who set up big pharma in the last hundred years in Germany in England in the
[55:37.480 --> 55:45.920]  United States who who set it up the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute the Rockefellers
[55:45.920 --> 55:52.800]  who literally set up Hitler Hitler had a plan that was the apple of British
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.840]  intelligence I they weren't going to go into Africa and Latin America and
[55:56.840 --> 56:01.200]  everywhere and just kill everybody the subhumans as they called them they were
[56:01.200 --> 56:05.280]  going to take over and then take the food and take the medicine to dumb the
[56:05.280 --> 56:11.640]  population down into an orderly extermination that's in Pulitzer prize
[56:11.640 --> 56:17.880]  winning books by the way like rise and fall the third Reich and others because
[56:17.880 --> 56:22.640]  the Germans needed living space I think it translates labum straw am I saying
[56:22.640 --> 56:27.880]  that wrong see it's not that I was crazy like
[56:27.880 --> 56:39.440]  Narls Barkley says it's that I knew too much meanwhile are we fighting you know
[56:39.440 --> 56:43.040]  if black folks would have rioted in New York five six years ago when it was in
[56:43.040 --> 56:47.320]  Newark Daily News that they were taking black kids from black women they tell
[56:47.320 --> 56:50.120]  them and then it was in the news you want to keep your two-year-old sign these
[56:50.120 --> 56:54.360]  forms let us have your seven-year-old and they take the little black kid and
[56:54.360 --> 56:59.200]  they strap them down and take a week to give them pesticide till they died in a
[56:59.200 --> 57:04.200]  big pharma test you don't have any animal rights folks that are worried
[57:04.200 --> 57:08.000]  about kids though they're only worried about rats not being tested on that's
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.320]  the you'll cost the lab for every young lady to be involved in that's the that's
[57:12.320 --> 57:18.200]  the you know trendy thing to do which I'm all for not having animal cruelty but
[57:18.200 --> 57:25.400]  that was in New York Daily News and no one got in trouble
[57:25.400 --> 57:29.600]  medical experiments on kids they do it to poor whites to the blacks are their
[57:29.600 --> 57:35.440]  favorites nobody listens to them no we're gonna have a woman fired from black
[57:35.440 --> 57:39.160]  educators association because she wasn't really black enough that's in the
[57:39.160 --> 57:45.920]  Egan news today so you got the black folks worried about somebody not being black
[57:45.920 --> 57:50.960]  enough but hey some kid you know hundreds of thousands of Christians getting
[57:50.960 --> 57:54.200]  killed nobody worries about that it's the Palestinians again I'm sad for the
[57:54.200 --> 57:58.240]  Palestinians my point is we're only told to debate about a thousand dead not

[59:59.360 --> 01:00:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:35.120]  Alex Jones I haven't even gotten into the infowords.com news it's all off the
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:40.240]  chart important and I haven't given the number out yet to take your phone calls
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:46.840]  we have the owner of one of the shops joining us that's in the news as shops
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.760]  right in the middle of where everything got looted and burned down in a
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:01:01.080]  suburb of St. Louis South St. Louis but we're gonna get County guns LLC owner on
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.080]  and of course it was in the local news folks out front their businesses they
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:10.080]  are 15s protecting them so that's very exciting see the second amendment
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:17.960]  maintaining order when obviously the police can't and I do think there should
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.360]  be more representative you know the fact that you're gonna see this kind of
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:27.840]  stuff happening when that area that town of Ferguson is mainly black and I think
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:33.200]  it's something like 80% of police force is white but then the argument is they've
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.000]  got all these drives nationwide to try to hire black officers and I know that's
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.080]  true because I look the statistics and they just can't hire them they just can't
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.880]  get up folks to go try to get the job but in my experience I've seen just as
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.440]  much police brutality black-on-black as I've seen white-on-black and the
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.120]  statistics show that again statistics don't lie
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.120]  depending on the area of the country it's between five and twelve times black
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.840]  on white crime that's not an anti-black statement it's just I'm telling you the
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:11.840]  fact five to twelve times black-on-white crime and it's similar number black-on-black
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:17.320]  there's just an attitude though that well whites are inherently bad I don't
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.120]  like one of the new black Panther Party guys sat down in Houston a few years ago
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.600]  to the news don't rob and steal from black people go do it to white crackers I
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.800]  mean most white crackers cracker asses are just like black folks working two
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:36.040]  three jobs and get some kind of assistance on the side because they
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.840]  can't make it and you know their kids are going to juvenile because the they
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.520]  got caught with marijuana and you know I mean I mean hell that half the people I
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:49.880]  see walking around or a black guy with a Hispanic lady or a white woman with a
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.240]  black guy or a white guy with a Hispanic lady I mean quite frankly
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:58.640]  everybody's getting along pretty good except for the media trying to create
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.080]  all this racial division and that's because that's all they've got folks
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.840]  they want to distract everybody with that and I just I'm just sick of it but
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:15.560]  it's mindless idiotic tribalism but I'm really sick of racist black people not
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:21.280]  knowing their races on the news Al Sharpton it just goes on and on where
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.840]  people feel like folks are racist against them so it's okay for them to have
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.200]  this stereotypical attitude that white people don't like them and then it
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:36.000]  becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where you just see incredible statements of
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.080]  you know anti-white garbage across the board and it's acceptable and so again
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.920]  all through this guilt complex government will oppress any group they
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.920]  can get away with so you had a bunch of white people with black folks ending
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.600]  slavery and then trying to end all these other abuses and then when the war is
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.960]  partially won against that instead of people going wow they're on a good white
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:05.720]  folks that said no to this all white people have been baptized in guilt and
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:13.480]  told they're all inherently bad even if their grandfather got here you know in
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:19.520]  1900 from Poland or Germany where nobody ever had any black slaves and they
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:24.320]  were slaves in Poland and slaves in Germany indentured servants most of the
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.320]  white people in this country weren't even here their ancestors didn't get
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.000]  here till slavery was over and then most of the white people that were here
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:39.840]  before well 3% in the South owned slaves and then the poor whites had their
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:44.680]  wages driven down by the slavery and were sharecroppers see I know the
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:50.240]  economics of all this so I refuse all the guilt I'm just tired of it I'm sick
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.120]  of it meanwhile they're putting cancer viruses and vaccines fluoride in the
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.760]  water brain damaging everybody killing people with Gardasil and nobody wants

[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:26.240]  all right I want to break down the situation unfolding in South St. Louis
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:32.520]  and in other areas like Ferguson the epicenter since a black 18 year old
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:39.040]  teen who from all indications looked like a pretty good guy got shot and the
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.120]  police are saying that he basically attacked him in the police car and
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:49.640]  resisted I mean the FBI shot one of the Boston bombing suspects friends in the
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.960]  back of the head and admitted he didn't resist and didn't have a weapon so a
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:09:00.320]  precedent it appears could be getting set like we saw with the famous Bart
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:07.720]  shooting of Oscar Grant where this happens or the crowd may be lying and at
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.920]  the same time he could have assaulted the officer and then tried to get the gun
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.680]  like they're saying we don't know the truth but what I know is it's wrong to
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.520]  run around and burn down grocery stores and mini-marts gas stations and people's
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:24.840]  houses and a bunch of criminals with their pants hanging down around their
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.800]  ankles you know their butts hanging out running around doing this and it's a
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:33.480]  microcosm of what will happen in this country if there's a bigger war a
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.880]  depression we've got millions of illegals pouring in there's a depression in
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.640]  many areas of the country we had troops a few years ago rolling around East St.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:47.440]  Louis preparing for civil unrest so they see this as a major hotspot we have a
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.640]  volunteer was actually on the fire department a firefighter who owns a
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:58.440]  gun shop he's a Adam Weinstein he owns County guns County guns dot com on
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:04.240]  Facebook it's County guns and he joins us because and we'll show some of these
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.520]  images of the tattoo parlor the gun shop and others in the shopping center
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:17.120]  that is right next door to businesses that were burned basically on both sides
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:26.600]  but the looters didn't go over there where folks had AR 15s so he joins us
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.640]  now now he's on call right now with the fire department and there are fires and
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.960]  things was more rioting last night so you may have to go at any time the police
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:41.040]  have been trying to keep the media out which is not a good sign there's a lot
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.440]  going on I've seen members of the city council having guns aimed at them by
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:49.800]  police for walking around with cameras so I think that's again too big a show
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.800]  of force by police but I guess their view is scare the public so the looting
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:59.080]  stops Adam thank you for coming on with us I appreciate you joining us hey
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.720]  done good I break down what you've witnessed the last three days four days
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:09.840]  and and and give us the inside scoop on the fact that you guys were armed
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:15.880]  outside your businesses well the first night which I guess was that would be
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:23.120]  Sunday we were all basically at home listening to the radio and the television
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:29.760]  and hearing things progress after the young man was shot killed and we could
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:36.320]  tell that the the looting and the crowd was was heading up West Wars and
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.960]  towards where our business was so we all just kind of decided to head up there
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.640]  and basically take a stand and and let them know that wasn't going to be
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:52.080]  tolerated at the strip hall where our business is located oh by the way let
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.320]  me just correct things it's Adam Weinstein I apologize for getting your
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:02.120]  name wrong Adam describe the town describe the relations I mean start at
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:06.120]  the beginning for us I mean I want to give you the floor to break down as an
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.520]  eyewitness to what has really been going on in three days of rioting in
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:16.080]  Ferguson Missouri outside St. Louis it's now obviously spread to other areas of
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:22.440]  South St. Louis last night what have you been witnessing it was mainly the
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:27.120]  Sunday night that were most of it happened and it was just crowds of
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.760]  people angry people that felt it necessary to destroy their own
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:40.320]  neighborhood basically they broke into and burned a quick trip several small
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.800]  businesses a shoe stores a tire at wheel place that had been in business for
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.440]  many years a family-owned business they smashed out the front windows and
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.240]  proceeded to load all of their merchandise in the vehicles and drive
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.680]  off they had clothing stores shoe stores just anything you know they
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:05.200]  is opportunist kind of action over the next day after that things calm down as
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:11.640]  far as the looting and any violence police were kind of staging the first
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.000]  day and more reacting to what was going on where the second day they were
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.640]  prepared and ready and I believe that they try to control it as much as
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.840]  they could they did a pretty good job at showing restraint trying not to escalate
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:34.360]  things and the night the main night that we were up there about four stores up
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.960]  from ours there's a dollar general and with us the large group of people
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:45.520]  probably 50 or more people smashed out the front windows and start to loot we
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:49.280]  stayed where we were at we called the police obviously they were quite busy
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.880]  that night took a while to show up at a time they did show up the crowd had
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:14:01.920]  dispersed they had left the scene after that the crowd returned and a few of
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.400]  them broke in again and continued to lose the place after a little while the
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  entire crowd started moving down the strip mall towards us next door to our
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.080]  business there is a beauty supply that sells the hair weave and other pretty
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.920]  high-end stuff and then on the other side we have a wireless store which
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:27.680]  seems to be popular for looting I guess because the expensive telephones and
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:34.280]  whatnot as they proceeded down the strip mall they saw us and quickly
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:40.200]  changed their minds and left we also posted up there last night just in case
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.880]  because some of the police officers that we know warned us that it could
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:49.360]  possibly be worse and last night was very uneventful we actually left about
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.280]  11 p.m. just there was absolutely no activity whatsoever in our area they
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.000]  had at least it did a very good job of containing it down mainly into Ferguson
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.400]  just trying to control the crowds and and I believe the victims family also had
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.920]  asked that you know they stopped all of the unnecessary violence and leaving you
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:16.720]  know to respectfully honor the kid again we're joined by Adam Weinstein who is a
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:23.560]  firefighter but he also owns a gun shop County guns County guns dot com County
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:29.200]  guns on Facebook and he is a witness to this and local news was able to
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.840]  photograph the fact that during the looting and rioting his stores were
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.200]  right beside where this happened but it was also a tattoo parlor I'm told it's
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:43.680]  close to you in the same strip mall our business is the gun shop is run out of
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.520]  the lobby of the tattoo parlor my business partner owns the tattoo shop
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:54.760]  and we decided to split the business in half basically to eliminate any overhead
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:03.160]  for the gun shop well Adam let's expand location sure look I'm here in Austin
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:08.000]  Texas and we've seen police before shoot people in cold blood on accident or
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.640]  on purpose and then cover it up but at the same time we see a lot of
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.480]  departments that don't do that I don't know enough about the Ferguson police to
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:24.800]  be able to give an accurate breakdown so so give us as a citizen your take on
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:30.080]  what's really happening and and what you've seen unfold I mean here's an
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.120]  example here CBS this is just out police say they won't release name of officer
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:40.000]  who shot killed Michael Brown and I guess their argument would be so there's no
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.040]  retaliation but the same time since when do we have secret police I mean I think
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.200]  we should learn the name give us your take on the police department in general
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.280]  the interactions I've had with them of course I may even be a little biased just
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.200]  because I interact with them you know through the fire department and
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.720]  occasionally on a personal level they all seem to be pretty professional to me I
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.280]  know that they've had a troubled relationship with their citizens but I
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.080]  believe you know I don't know any of the details of the story so I can't
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:16.400]  speculate on that but I can understand them not releasing it for his safety and
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.040]  also maybe just so I can conclude their investigation before they start putting
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:29.480]  anybody's names out there I've been asking the questions here any keep key
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.760]  points you'd like to relate to folks it's not as bad as it's being portrayed
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:42.280]  in the media I mean there was one main evening of pretty unruly behavior and a
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:47.240]  lot of looting and a lot of property damage and the next day there were some
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:52.800]  isolated incidents outside of the area that they attributed to the situation but
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:58.760]  for the most part after last night in the evening after the press conferences
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.200]  with the family and whatnot things seem pretty common I mean you still have large
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.600]  groups of people out there protesting and you know standing their ground but as
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:12.480]  far as you know the violence of the looting it's nothing like being portrayed
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:19.040]  on some of the news stations but since the mother went public and said you know
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:23.160]  please stop the violence do you think that helped I believe it did it seemed
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.720]  to I mean unless it's a coincidence it kind of coincided with the next day
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:33.080]  where the police were expecting another wave it pretty much didn't happen I
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.880]  mean there was like I said some isolated incidents but for the most part you know
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:43.320]  it was mainly peaceful protesting which is you know how it should be Adam
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:51.560]  Weinstein is our guest and I wanted to ask you specifically the media reporter
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.920]  that you guys stood out front the business with your AR-15s and that the
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:01.320]  looters went on by I mean is it accurate to say kind of like the Koreans and the
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:06.320]  famous LA riots that the fact that you were there and armed may have stopped
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:12.120]  looting of your business I truly believe that if we had not been out there
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:19.320]  whether armed or not armed I personally believe that that is a deterrent but I
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:23.240]  believe that if we hadn't been out there they would have looted and destroyed that
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:28.200]  entire strip mall where there's probably a dozen businesses and not one of them
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.720]  were touched except for the dollar general would have to be detached from the strip
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:37.200]  mall well then good news is the police didn't try to stop you from defending
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.320]  your business and a lot of Democrat controlled areas they do that because the
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:45.440]  big crime in a socialist system is defending yourself not committing
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.640]  crimes because everybody that has a business is a greedy person unless
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.960]  you're Nancy Pelosi and a billion dollars and you're not allowed to defend
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:56.040]  yourself Adam stay there I want to do five more minutes with you to talk about

[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:13.760]  final segment with Adam Weinstein he is the member of the fire department there
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:20.800]  in the town of Ferguson outside St. Louis that saw the last three days of
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:25.720]  rioting the worst being Sunday night and now since the mother of the 18-year-old
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:31.280]  black man the victim regardless he is a victim of this terrible
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:37.240]  circumstance and possibly being murdered by the police well we're not sure has
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.960]  called for calm that's a good thing certainly a bunch of criminals running
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.200]  around burning things their own neighborhood anybody that has a
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:57.400]  business only hurts the town itself but regardless Adam and his friends stood
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:04.440]  up against the looters and clearly frustrated folks that did loot other
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:10.560]  buildings in the area that did not have armed guards outside of them so this is
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.800]  a great example of what the police should do like Katrina instead of the feds
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:20.840]  coming in and not letting people stay in their shops or homes with firearms to
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.160]  protect them even when they were high and dry they came in and took their
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.440]  guns and then looters came along later and stole everything they had but in the
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:37.240]  case of LA or the case of Ferguson and St. Louis the police did not try to keep
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:41.880]  the folks from being armed did you have a chance to talk to the police during
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.440]  this or after it Adam yeah I wanted to mention to you also correct you I'm not
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.960]  a member of the Ferguson fire department I am a singleist county
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.800]  firefighter okay just to be clear so the police actually came by on several
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.920]  occasions and thank us which surprised me I was kind of expecting them to
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:06.960]  possibly run us off just for their own safety concerns but they were very
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:12.600]  pleased to see us and a few of them mentioned that they they wish some more
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.920]  business owners would have done the same thing there would have been a lot
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:21.600]  less damage and that they were they were glad to see that we were being respectful
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:28.000]  and professional and not you know abusing our right to bear arms so they
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.520]  liked the fact that you were professional in bearing your arms and
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:37.720]  obviously I guess my professional did you get taunted or anything no not at all
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:44.040]  like I said as soon as they saw us they went the other way they our shop has a
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:50.880]  reputation in that area for you know we don't we don't mess around because of
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:56.440]  the area we're in we have a lot of different people in the area and some
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.760]  of the ones who tend to misbehave in that shopping center know that that
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:05.080]  stuff isn't really tolerated by myself or my business partner or the other owner
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:13.960]  of the tattoo shop so this is a high crime area I would say medium not
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.680]  necessarily high but there's there's a neighborhood behind our location that
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:25.400]  has its problems we've had you know a few minor incidents over the the last few
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:33.640]  years and it's it's typically the kids in that neighborhood what is your gut
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:40.880]  tell you is behind all this I think it's more of a I believe that the citizens
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.480]  are just angry with the police department whether justified or not I
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:51.600]  think it's more of citizens versus law enforcement things that any any race
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.960]  issues sure haven't even released the officer's name whether he's African
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.600]  American or white or Hispanic nobody even knows so that well I'm guessing he's
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:07.760]  I'm guessing he's white because or Hispanic because if he was black I think
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:12.640]  they would have released that yeah I'm not sure about that over the next few
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.520]  weeks or days as they progress at their investigation I'm sure the
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:22.640]  information will come out I'm hoping and counting on it being true well I mean
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:29.160]  bottom line burning down shoe stores and and and and many marts and businesses
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:33.720]  is only gonna make people move out of the area and hurt the community I just
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:39.680]  don't get this default action after Trayvon Martin we saw a raft of black on
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:45.240]  white assaults of old people knockout games that even killed some folks and I
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.840]  just don't understand like of a black person killed a member of my family I
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.840]  wouldn't go out and randomly find a black person to kill and I just think
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:59.960]  it's the Al Sharpton MSNBC mentality that is shelling this idea but I'm glad
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:03.960]  to hear from your perspective it's more of just an anti-police than an anti you
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:10.760]  know race issue I'm just so sick of it personally I think it directly relates
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:16.600]  to just the the attitude of youth today that they're they're so quick to to use
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:21.840]  violence over anything else and whether white black you know or Hispanic it
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.840]  just seems to be the the norm nowadays where kids just you know right off the
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:33.640]  bat they go to to violence and it's one of the biggest problems that I see you
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:39.120]  know every day just even in my job it's young kids you know high school age and
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.200]  below that are doing things that that are just yeah it's the break up of the

[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.600]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:11.640]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.840]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.680]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.040]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types

[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:15.800]  I'm going to open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast and cover news now, and boy
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.760]  is there a lot of it.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.720]  The toll-free number to join us on air for first-time callers, yet again, or if you haven't
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:32.720]  called in five years, first-time callers or ancient callers, to give new folks a chance
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:39.520]  to get involved on air, on any of the news we've covered today, on Gardasil shots, time
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:45.120]  and time again, killing people on the trials, killing people currently, sterilizing them,
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:50.680]  causing autoimmune disorders, giving them HPV.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:54.240]  Now they're saying, give it to boys.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:57.040]  The schools lie and say it's the law.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.960]  Other countries abandon it.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:13.480]  You can say what you want about India and Japan and places like Brazil, but they're
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.560]  saying don't give kids younger than 18 months of vaccines.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.000]  They're saying don't eat GMO.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:28.120]  They're saying we're banning Gardasil because they can see the effects of it.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:35.880]  Now before we go any further here today, let me just give you the toll-free number.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:46.320]  It's 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:50.840]  We can discuss the Gardasil story that hurts my heart every time I see those reports every
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:57.720]  few weeks, but it's bigger than just a little girl dying hours after she took it.
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:02.480]  It's that they just keep us in perpetual ignorance of why did this happen?
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.120]  Oh gee, we don't know.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.400]  Was it the vaccine?
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.040]  When we know it's the vaccine and everyone knows people that took a vaccine and died
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:20.320]  or took a vaccine and went into a coma, and then the media goes there are no side effects
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:26.760]  of vaccines, save and effective, until you read the insert and it says can give you narcolepsy,
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:32.080]  epilepsy, neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders, death, cancer.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:39.000]  Of the flu shot, polio vaccine, Gardasil, I don't care which one it is, read the insert
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.600]  that comes with the drug, go online, type in the insert.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:46.040]  You can read the thing.
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:51.400]  You don't have to believe me that drinking one part per million of hydrofluorosilicic
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:58.960]  acid, a.k.a. fluoride, will massively reduce your IQ, a little over 10 points per decade.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:05.160]  It'll give you dental fluorosis and fracturing of bones and rheumatoid arthritis and a seven-fold
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:10.400]  increase in bone cancer in boys and men.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:20.280]  Kidney cancer, I mean, I just, I try not to blow up on air, but we're being killed by
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:26.000]  the globalist who have all literally written hundreds of books like Ecoscience by the White
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.760]  House Science are admitting they're jacking the food and the water in social engineering.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:31.760]  People go, man, you're crazy.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:35.600]  Yeah, I know, because if you admit I'm telling the truth, then you've got to do something
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.600]  about it.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:42.380]  I'm going to say this again, my grandmother, and that's it, Buckley.
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.380]  She said she'd do it.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:47.000]  We're going over there and interviewing her about her polio experience because she's
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.440]  nine, she's still about 97% there.
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:58.520]  She's obviously not as sharp as she was when she was, you know, 60 years old.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.520]  But she's there.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:00.520]  She's got a great memory.
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:03.840]  And I wanted to talk about that because you can tell my mom that since, you know, my
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:06.720]  mother was five years old.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:07.960]  This is the reality.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:12.480]  And then I can pull up news articles out of India and Pakistan where they suspend the polio
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:18.800]  shot because in one month, 60 plus thousand kids got paralyzed from it and they said, we
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.680]  don't call it polio.
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:26.360]  They got paralysis from it.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.120]  They're not eradicating polio.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.720]  They're giving people polio.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:34.560]  And this is the same global government caught doing all the secret medical experimentation
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.720]  over and over and over again.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.520]  They're evil.
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:41.800]  It's bigger than Obama.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.480]  It's bigger than the Republicans.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.920]  It's bigger than the British government.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.720]  It's bigger than the French government.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.480]  It's bigger than the Russian government.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.240]  It's the technocracy.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:58.080]  So we can talk about that 800-259-9231 and I see callers calling it about Robin Williams.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.080]  Yeah.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.080]  It's a wild card.
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.480]  Whatever you want to call in about, you're welcome to call in about it.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.040]  You can talk about the Ferguson situation.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:11.720]  You can talk about any of it.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:29.160]  Now, let me spend a few minutes here reaching out to the listeners in a moment of stillness
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:37.080]  here so it's not all just lost in translation or lost in my banter that when I tell you
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:44.960]  about how big info wars.com is how big this radio show is, it is not to have a big ego.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:51.520]  It is to let you know that we are engaged in a major assault of the globalist and their
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:55.880]  eugenics program.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.160]  We are here to speak directly to the White House operatives and the Ford Foundation and
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:10.600]  CIA and NSA and Department of Defense and corporate IBM, Microsoft, Google, Apple operatives
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:16.960]  who are let in on the technocracy, who are let in on the master plan.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:23.080]  They understand they're not going to be given entree into the next level of this.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:31.080]  They are operating out of fear, out of greed, out of mercenary instincts and we've got
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:36.680]  to get the narrative out there that we are breaking away from their whole fake debate
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:43.040]  and communicating directly with them on a true narrative of are you really evil?
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:48.240]  Do you really want to go along with this and your whole fake progressive liberal touchy
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:56.080]  feely, simpering MPR voice that you know is a cover for the savage dehumanization and
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:02.160]  social engineering that you're part of?
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.320]  And then for the listeners out there, you need to become your own newsletter, your own
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:14.240]  website, your own YouTube channel, your own local radio show, your own access show or
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:19.680]  to your own students or your college students or your workers or your bosses.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.800]  We all need to be communicating with each other about these issues and about the fact
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.040]  that you can say the cop down the street is a nice guy or a nice lady, but the people
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.760]  running the system are bad.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:39.560]  And so we can't let the system get more centralized control because it only uses that to dominate
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.120]  and dumb down society.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:51.120]  And then secondarily, it is integral to understand infowars.com, prisonplanet.com is under attack
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:42:00.760]  and the power structure is doing everything it can to ensure that we are blocked, we are
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.840]  demonized, we are attacked on every front.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:10.800]  They're trying to assassinate my character, my name, my whole operation unsuccessfully,
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:14.720]  I might add, and that's what's scary, I'll explain in a moment.
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:16.000]  Because we are over the target.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.440]  When you fly over the target, the anti-aircraft guns are aimed on you.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:27.640]  You fly into the flak to drop your bombs because that's where the war is.
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:33.680]  And I never imagined as a child or even as an activist when I was 20 years old, trying
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:38.120]  to get on radio and TV, I didn't want to get on radio and TV to be somebody.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.480]  I didn't want to get on radio and TV to be a narcissist.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:46.120]  I wanted to get on radio and TV because I knew they were taking farmers land outside
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:51.360]  Austin to build on it under the guise of environmentalism and I took it personal.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:55.840]  I knew they were giving fines to old ladies and people that they couldn't fix the grass
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:58.000]  in their backyard to take their houses.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.960]  I took it personal.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.040]  Just like if I saw somebody three or four guys beating up some little guy in a parking
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:08.040]  lot, I'm going to go over and tell them pick on somebody your own size and not because
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:13.920]  I'm looking for trouble, but because my instinct makes me go up to them.
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:16.760]  It's just how I am.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:20.800]  And the fact that we are hurting the enemy so bad and they're attacking us every day
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:25.280]  in establishment organs with talking points and the fact that it's getting worse and that
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.400]  it's ineffective.
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:36.480]  If they destroyed me in my name or made up some scandal and really damaged me, then they
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:40.720]  wouldn't kill me or set me up or imprison me.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:46.000]  But the fact that everything they do bounces off of Info Wars, we are now crossing that
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.920]  event horizon that even though I'm real and act goofy sometimes and they could spin that
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:56.360]  against me, the public is spun it back against them and it's made Info Wars and yours truly
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:00.480]  even bigger and it's backfired.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:08.360]  It's boomeranged and I can see the tea leaves, ladies and gentlemen, politically that if
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:15.800]  we continue to exponentially grow like this in our reach and our paradigm shifting understanding,
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:21.440]  they will come after me and I'm not scared of that.
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:30.760]  I don't look forward to it, but it's something that has to be done.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:34.680]  But I want everyone to understand something.
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:39.720]  That is the great victory of life is knowing the road you're going down and going down
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:46.120]  that road because in the end, setting a good example, being strong, not backing down will
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:51.360]  be the example to others that will defeat the New World Order and that will protect the
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:55.560]  innocents that are being attacked by them on every front because that's their real target
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:56.560]  is the innocence.
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:02.240]  That's what evil wants to destroy is children and the innocent, beautiful mind.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.080]  And that's the job of men.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:12.440]  Being a man doesn't mean you have huge muscles or that you can do 500 push-ups, though that
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.760]  has historically been a mark of a man who's capable and who's not lazy.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:23.640]  That's important, but not as important as the moral courage to do what is demanded of
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:30.120]  you genetically and in your family line and your family name to not be a creature of your
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:40.200]  age of decadence and evil and to stand against the flood of tyranny.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:49.000]  And it is the fire that tests the metal that in the end will purify and will sanctify because
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.280]  faith without works is dead.
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:01.440]  And so many men out there that pose and pretend that they're challenging evil and that work
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:12.920]  in the system, they know deep down they have betrayed their ancestors.
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:19.040]  They have betrayed everything that is important.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.040]  And so people out there need to decide which side they're on because deep down everyone
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:29.600]  who still has a soul, everyone who has a conscience, everyone who still has at least God's hand
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:37.240]  on them a little bit knows that great evil is rising and that you have the answers to
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:38.240]  what needs to be done.
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:40.000]  You don't need me to tell you what to do.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.080]  You know what you can do in your area.
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:46.760]  None of us have to save the world by ourselves, but by starting on the path of challenging
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:52.840]  evil and challenging corruption, we can find the levers that will move the world together
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:55.120]  with our good intentions.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:03.840]  And then by stepping forward, God, the creator of the universe, as Martin Luther King said,
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:13.080]  the universe bends towards justice will give us the providence, the manifest destiny to
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:18.080]  turn the tide.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:26.400]  But we will be judged first, but the tide will be turned early in the judgment and the
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:32.640]  judgment will not be as deep as it would be and it will not be continual that you see
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.520]  so many nations completely collapse into absolute squalor and wickedness.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:46.080]  The whole world is either going to collapse into a black hole of pure repine or we're
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.360]  going to reverse this.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:53.000]  But again, even if you think you don't have any power, even if you've been taught that
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  you're a nothing, it is the animating contest of liberty.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.960]  It is the spiritual decision to say, I stand against the New World Order.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:04.360]  I stand against those that love death.
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.000]  I stand against those that serve Satan.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.480]  I stand against those that would hurt the innocence.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:17.000]  It is that decision and simply throwing your hands up and saying, God, the universe, you
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.480]  don't have to believe in God, folks, God believes in you.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:24.360]  Say God, show me, help me be better.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:30.840]  I repent, help me be good, help me be strong, help me be a warrior, direct me to what I
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:38.840]  need to do and the doors will open and the great adventure will begin and your free
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:45.640]  will will be activated and then all those areas, all your gifts that God gave you, all
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:54.720]  the memories, all the instincts, all the ancestral programming that God gave you, the incredible
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:01.480]  experience of touching your ancestors.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.880]  Reality is so much more complex than people can even imagine.
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:10.800]  Yes, we live after death and yes, the experiences of our ancestors, they live on through us.
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:11.800]  It is incredible.
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:18.440]  It is so multi-layered and amazing and the New World Order knows this and is trying
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.440]  to block it.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.240]  I'm going to go to Brent and come back with your calls, Josh, Mary, John, Mitchell, Jonathan
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:29.560]  and others, but we need to realize how epic and big things are and pull ourselves back
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:32.240]  from the globalists trying to make us feel small.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:36.960]  By realizing how small they are, that is the beginning of their downfall.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:41.560]  That's why they have the red carpets and Air Force One and the giant studios and all of
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:48.600]  it is to project the invincibility deception like the Wizard of Oz.

[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:28.440]  I really love this Magic Mud product.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:32.440]  Because charcoal is so absorbent, it's very effective at taking off all the sticky plaque
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.280]  and debris that gets stuck on our teeth every day.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:36.160]  I highly recommend My Magic Mud.

[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:00.040]  Question.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:04.760]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:05.760]  Answer.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:06.760]  Yes.
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:12.160]  If you have powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use ProEM1 from Tarragonix.
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:17.280]  ProEM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic that uses good bacteria to suppress pathogens and
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:19.560]  gently eliminate toxins from your body.

[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:56.320]  ProEM1 from Tarragonix.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:09.840]  Everything's getting better.
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:24.160]  The moment we realize how epic consciousness is, people will stop committing suicide because
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:30.760]  they weren't making enough millions and might have to sell their mansions, like Robin Williams
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:33.600]  who I feel sorry for.
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:38.120]  The minute we realize we're in the universe and we're part of something so big and so
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:44.200]  ancient, and that humanity is on the cusp of such incredible things, then we'll see
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:50.840]  what jokes mainstream media is and all their attempts to play games, they're cheating to
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:57.520]  maintain control instead of empowering humanity so we can ascend together.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:04.960]  They're having us descend so they can reign in hell instead of serve in heaven.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:10.640]  It's better to burn out than fade away as they burn all of society out.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:15.840]  I want to go, since I mentioned Robin Williams, so I'm very sad as dead, it looks like a suicide
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:16.840]  to John.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:21.760]  We'll go to Josh, Mary, Mitchell, Jonathan, and others, total open phones the next hour.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:23.240]  You're on the air, John.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:24.240]  Go ahead.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:25.240]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.240]  Hey.
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:31.600]  You know, I was reading about, you know, I was reading about Robert Williams, he's just
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:37.520]  another one in a long line of actors that came to a bad end in Hollywood, but you know,
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:41.120]  Hollywood was a moral place and it chews up actors left to right, that's a moral.
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:44.920]  We could sit here all day and talk about all the actors that came to a bad end in Hollywood.
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:50.560]  Well, what happens is, you know, they can make $5 million a movie, they have so many
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:55.240]  managers and people that if they're out of work awhile, the managers and people chew
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:03.680]  up all their funds, and then they again live in these big palaces and yes, it's not fulfilling.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:08.880]  We've got everybody chasing Hollywood believing it's going to fulfill you and it's not going
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:09.880]  to fulfill you.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:10.880]  Go ahead.
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:15.480]  And there's a few actors like Jimmy Tagney and Jimmy Stewart and Ernest Borgner and
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.240]  our few of them that came out all right, you know, that led happy lives, but most of them
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.240]  come to a bad end.
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.040]  Yeah, Ernest Borgner, Borgner who died this year, he was a listener, but I never got him
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:28.040]  on the show.
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.040]  It's like laziness.
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.760]  Joe Rogan's about to be in town next week and I know I can get him in studio.
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:37.320]  I just need to call him and you know, it's the same thing with Borgner and I just never
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.920]  tried to get him on.
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:42.200]  But people want to hear from those folks, so I should do that.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:45.760]  But I mean, I like Robin Williams, but you know, his politics, though, were not very
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:46.760]  pro-liberty.
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:52.320]  It was kind of a bunch of leftist stuff, but still he was, you know, good actor, kind of
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:55.680]  typecast, but everybody's freaking out about his death.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.560]  What about the death of all these people taking Gardasil?
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:01.160]  Again, 1,000 Palestinians are dead.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:02.160]  Okay.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.160]  I don't like it.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.160]  I think it's terrible.
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:10.280]  It's terrible what Hamas is doing as well, but I don't hate Israel and I don't hate the
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:16.800]  Palestinians, but you get 300,000 people killed by IS and al-Qaeda and nobody wants to talk
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:17.800]  about it.
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:20.320]  Hey, Arabs, stop killing the Arab Christians.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:23.400]  Ah, shut up, you Israel lover.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:29.080]  It's just, it's a immoral cop out so they can run around with al-Qaeda, chopping everybody's
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:32.200]  heads off and dragging people behind motorbikes.
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:36.040]  And I say, please stop doing it to non-radical Muslims and Christians, and they go, shut
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:38.720]  up, Jew.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:42.040]  And so, you know, that's my issue is I'm not Jewish, but they want to say I am okay.
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:47.240]  I'm Jewish because it just becomes a moral cop out by all these anti-Israel people.
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:50.480]  They don't have to know any facts or know anything about quantum mechanics or know anything
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:51.480]  about history.
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:54.640]  They just run around screaming, I hate Jews all day.
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:58.520]  And it's the same thing for the folks that are 100% pro-Israel.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:01.080]  Everyone else is bad, but if you're pro-Israel.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:05.200]  When Israel's got all its own corruption and problems, I mean, you know, I see this meme
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.240]  on infowars.com, and I appreciate your call, and I'm gonna break and come back with more
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.240]  people.
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:16.960]  NSA doc reveals ISIS leader is U.S. British and Israeli intelligence asset.
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:21.400]  New Snowden documents, July 19th.
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:22.520]  I looked it up this morning.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:25.800]  We have no fewer than seven articles since July 19th about this.
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:30.840]  And I see this meme on YouTube and info wars saying, Alex Jones won't talk about how ISIS
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.560]  is connected to Israel.
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:36.400]  I've probably talked about it 50 times, and I'm not defending myself.
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:41.320]  I'm just saying I'm a pathetic morons you are, and you're in fantasy land how you're
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:47.480]  morally superior to me as you bribe at me when you're regurgitating stuff that broke
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:49.800]  on this show.
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:52.760]  This is Alex Jones for infowarslife.com.

[01:59:52.680 --> 02:00:05.680]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:10.480]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:11.480]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:13.640]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:21.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:26.280]  I've been preaching a lot today, we're opening the phones up, we'll take a lot of those calls,
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:32.440]  and I will get to a whole parcel of news like Justice in Missouri, Burn Down the Town, former
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:39.160]  FDA official warns of spooky scenarios, the Babola hits US, special report back to school
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:45.800]  mind control exposed, kill switch, smart phone, bill, passes in California, that's big, I'm
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:51.440]  going to break that down, video, top aims, gun at local officials.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:58.680]  As Ferguson resembles war zone, Rancher says wild hogs are eating remains of illegal aliens.
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:03.320]  Ukraine accuses Russia of attempting false flag.
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:06.880]  Ferguson is a perfect example of how quickly the streets of America descend into chaos.
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:09.400]  That's some of the articles up on infowars.com.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:10.400]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:15.640]  Josh in Missouri talking about the riots, day three of those, hopefully they're simmering
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:20.400]  down now after the mother of the young black man who was killed calls for peace, which
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.480]  is a classy thing for her to do.
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:24.680]  Josh, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:26.920]  Hi, Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:30.000]  Doing alright, brother, thanks for calling.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.360]  I just wanted to let you know that on Craigslist, they were sending out ads that tell people
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.520]  to come help them loop on Sunday night, and then...
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:42.440]  Is that mainstream news, or did you find that yourself, because I'm going to do an article
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:43.440]  on that?
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:45.640]  No, that's not mainstream news yet.
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:52.080]  My dad, you know, we're from around North County, right near Ferguson, and he, you know,
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:57.080]  we all work around here, and he was out with the customer, and they were telling him, look
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:00.360]  on Craigslist, and we went, and sure enough, it was there.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:08.360]  All right, do me a favor, well, you send show tips at infowars.com, those links for Ferguson
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:12.840]  looting since you had them, I want to get one of our writers to a story on that.
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:15.680]  That is very interesting, the show that it was premeditated.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:21.040]  We have a clip of a guy up on infowars.com saying, this is how we protest, we loot.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:25.200]  And it's just an excuse for the criminal element to run around and act like a bunch of idiots.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:30.720]  And again, as I've said, the power structure is going to use looting in this country with
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:38.200]  the welfare class as a pretext to bring total control in.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:39.200]  What else did you observe?
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.560]  Yes, sir, go ahead, Josh.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:46.080]  I just want to let you know, it should not be about race, because we are the human race.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.480]  And that's, you know, the main topic we should be talking about, and you exposed that so
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:56.400]  well, Alex, and I amend you, and we should amend, or we should be applauding what the
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:02.960]  mother of the son that was killed, you know, had come out and said, and we also should
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.120]  come out and say, I'm mad as hell, and we're not going to take this no more because the
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:11.680]  globalists are running it all, like you're, you know, great, you know, broadcast you're
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:14.560]  having today, because you're exposing exactly what's going on.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:20.320]  I mean, from H.C. Wells, to Edward Bernays, to, to that's all, it's been controlled for
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.320]  so long.
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:26.240]  And I think the public's so stupid, and they've successfully done people down, so that we
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:31.040]  fit into this paradigm where they're the elitist, the Morlocks, and we're the Eloi, and I'm
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:36.920]  saying, we need a revolt of the Eloi intellectually, because freedom is sexy, we need to sell
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.320]  that idea to everyone instead of the tyranny they're selling us as utopia.
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:42.480]  Thank you, Josh.
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:43.480]  Great points.
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:45.400]  Listening on the free iPhone app.
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:47.440]  Let's talk to Mary in New Jersey.
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:48.440]  You're on the air.
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:49.440]  Hi.
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:50.440]  Hi, Alex.
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:56.480]  I wanted to talk about two things, a young man that was killed in Missouri, and also,
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:59.960]  I wanted to mention quickly something about Dr. Oz.
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:07.760]  So about a month and a half ago, Dr. Oz was called in front of the Senate, and they scolded
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:15.600]  him like a little kid, because he has exposed on his show, like fire retardant, how it doesn't
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:18.480]  really stop fires, it really just is toxic.
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:21.480]  Yeah, no, Dr., you know what I'm saying, I don't want to come back to you over the
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:22.480]  break.
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:23.480]  I don't want to cut you short.
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:27.960]  I don't watch a lot of mainline TV, but I see the boil downs of it on YouTube.
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:31.080]  And Dr. Oz has covered vaccines hurting people.
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:33.600]  He's covered GMO being bad and some other stuff.
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:34.880]  They've come after him.
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:38.040]  And so I've been told by folks that know him and have been interviewed by him, he's now
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.400]  backed off.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:44.720]  And so that's an example of how there are people that are good overall and really want
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:51.960]  to warn people, but aren't allowed to, kind of like that CBS reporter who exposed fast
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:56.040]  and furious and so many other things, and Obamacare and got forced out.
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:59.960]  Pull it back.
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:02.880]  This is Leigh Ann McAdoo for infowarslife.com.
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:08.040]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, master herbologist and chief formulator behind the Info Wars
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:09.040]  Life products.
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:12.800]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking super female
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:13.800]  vitality?
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:18.600]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from super male vitality, from emails to even
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:20.400]  excited callers on the radio.
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:25.640]  Now, the answer for women is here, a new formulation specifically designed for the female
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:32.320]  body, super female vitality delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:34.080]  the unique biology of women.
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:36.200]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:40.320]  When he brought me home, the bottle's different female, I had tons of energy, tons of motivation,
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:41.320]  a lot of drive.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:43.320]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:45.800]  Our relationship, all I can say, it's just a lot better now.
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:50.560]  I've just started taking super female vitality from infowarslife.com.

[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:03.880]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:06.780]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:11.560]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:15.920]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:21.360]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, you now know it as survival shield,
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:24.440]  true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:28.120]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:34.200]  come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals, and the results that I personally have had
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:36.360]  have been life changing.
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:41.240]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:45.880]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:49.560]  of the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:03.840]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:05.240]  I didn't taste dirt in it.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:06.600]  God knows what's in this.
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:10.600]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:16.000]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  system.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000]  Now when it is better.
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.400]  Yep, I know what it tastes like.
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:21.400]  It's good water.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:26.480]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:27.480]  others.
[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:31.400]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:33.880]  tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:36.920]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in the tap water.
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:42.800]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:44.800]  tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:46.040]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:47.040]  It's good water.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:48.040]  Refreshing.
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:49.040]  It's good.

[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:26.840]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:32.720]  Look at some of these headlines.
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:39.280]  Military researchers are developing robot fighter pilots that fire weapons.
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:45.480]  The Obama administration has released more than 600 illegal immigrants with criminal
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:47.760]  convictions.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:50.840]  Homeland security broke the law.
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:57.040]  Dreamers plan to occupy Ted Cruz's office.
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:00.880]  Obama said that Hillary's Syria criticism is horse crap.
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:04.160]  And I'm altering the word from an FCC violation.
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:09.880]  He said, horse, Bravo Sierra, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:13.000]  And of course, that whole thing with her saying she liked George Bush and he was better than
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  Obama.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.920]  And Obama's saying he's mad at her and MSNBC talking about it with Axl Rod interviewing
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:21.200]  him, his former mentor.
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:29.040]  It's all distancing herself from the administration she runs with Bill.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:31.320]  Total smoke and mirrors.
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:35.480]  Look, hotels are introducing robot butlers.
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:43.120]  Again, the replacement of humanity is moving ahead at full steam ahead.
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:49.280]  Some of the news up on drudgereport.com, a lot of it's also up on infowars.com.
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:53.600]  We redesigned infowars.com a few months ago and even more modern versions coming in a
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:54.600]  few months.
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:59.760]  But in the interim, we went to a new design where the whole bottom half has breaking news
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:03.760]  in a bigger and better format and a lot of new features.
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:06.960]  So be sure and check out not just the top of infowars.com.
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:14.680]  Be sure and scroll down into all of the other news that is there on the site and all the
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:24.040]  different apps and free podcast and political cartoons and so much more that is online at
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:29.280]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:36.520]  And please don't forget the globalists are working around the clock to try to block us
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:42.080]  and censor us and keep us off military bases and government computers and library computers
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:48.480]  and Amtrak wireless networks to keep you from this information for a reason.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:52.400]  We're going to talk about that at the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:59.720]  Kill switch, smartphone bill, passes in California and that dovetails with the rise of the robots
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:06.800]  in an episode in 1998 of sworn to secrecy, the Panama invasion that we finally found
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:07.800]  the clip of.
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:11.240]  I'll tie it all together at the bottom of the hour.
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:13.840]  Let's go to Mary in New Jersey.
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:15.320]  She held over from the last segment.
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:18.360]  She was bringing up Dr. Oz in Congress.
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:21.600]  I heard he got chewed out in testimony, but I didn't see it.
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:26.920]  He did cover some GMO vaccine dangers and I was told by insiders that were guests and
[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:31.600]  also someone that works with him that they did get threatened and got heat on them just
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:36.880]  like Ventura show did and he basically sings a more pro establishment tune.
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:41.640]  But see, the fact that he's backed off now under pressure, I at least know secretly he
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:44.200]  cares about people.
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:48.360]  What really makes me sick is people that hate those of us that are trying to warn folks
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:54.200]  about GMO and fluoride and the rest of it and then know that they're lying to people
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:58.880]  and then hate us and choose to go with the establishment and then don't give their kids
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:02.080]  GMO and don't drink fluoride water.
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:08.000]  I had the state attorney on for Maryland about eight years ago.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.520]  It was all over CNN, you name it.
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:13.160]  Remember when they had thousands of kids lined up with police dogs barking and riot police
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:21.960]  in a predominantly black area of Baltimore, Maryland, not Philadelphia, Baltimore, Maryland.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:28.800]  And the story got real big and parents were going to protest so SWAT teams came and riot
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:33.280]  cops and dogs barking and they were on the news saying, it's the law, you'll be arrested,
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:34.960]  give them a shot.
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:39.200]  And I had him on and I said, you know, you're tricking people, there's a waiver and that's
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:45.000]  not even for a law and you're kicking them out of school then letting truancy kick in
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.400]  and that's how you arrest them.
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:51.360]  But truancy under Maryland law isn't applicable because it's the school that kicks them out
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:55.840]  for a policy, not a law, so you really can't trigger the criminal charges.
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:13:00.680]  And he said, man, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:02.280]  He said, man, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:03.280]  You're right.
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:08.000]  He goes, we even have the waiver forms up there on the judge's desk in case somebody
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.280]  figures it out and demands one, but they never do.
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:13.400]  He was a black guy years ago.
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:14.400]  I talked about it.
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.400]  We found the clip again and played it.
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:16.400]  It's just stunning.
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:18.560]  One of those things were and I go, let me ask you a question.
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:19.560]  You vaccinate your kids.
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:21.680]  No, I sure don't started laughing.
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:25.160]  I went, you just fool people, don't you?
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:32.040]  And he said, I just do my job.
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:39.080]  He doesn't give his kids vaccines.
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:40.080]  Think about that.
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:41.640]  Let that sink in.
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:46.560]  They get up there, regardless of what you think about the vaccines and they fool everybody
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:48.640]  and tell you it's the law.
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:53.760]  There is no law.
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:56.680]  That's called an organized criminal conspiracy or racketeering.
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.960]  Mary, tell me about the Dr. Oz grilling that you mentioned in Congress.
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:01.960]  Go ahead.
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:02.960]  Okay.
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:06.680]  Well, first of all, I do know him.
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:08.080]  I worked with him since 94.
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:10.080]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.080]  I didn't know that.
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:13.760]  I was mentioning folks that I knew that knew him.
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:14.760]  I didn't know you knew him.
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:15.760]  Go ahead.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:16.760]  Yeah, I know him.
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:17.760]  And it's very unfair.
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:18.760]  I hate to show.
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:25.840]  He was exposing things like the chicken being sent off to China just like you do.
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:29.360]  And he was shocked at finding some of these things.
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.880]  And he does recommend natural products.
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:33.560]  He gets other doctors on there.
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:38.960]  He's one of the best cardiothoracic surgeons in the world.
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:44.200]  He's not an internist, but he's interested in this stuff himself.
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:46.560]  So he gets people on there that do study.
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:52.400]  So one of the things the FDA and some big company were saying that, oh, he recommended
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:59.440]  the green coffee beans from the Andes, like they're not supposed to do that.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:05.520]  And also that they were giving full hope to people losing weight.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:12.040]  Well, he never says not to exercise, but there were some studies where people lost
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:18.200]  the certain amount of weight over over a period of time, even sure, I'm glad you mentioned
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:19.200]  this.
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:23.040]  Listen, everybody knows that coffee is a stimulant.
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:27.680]  Everybody knows that stimulants are what you give people to suppress appetite.
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:34.160]  And again, they don't like a respected medical doctor who has respected people on big pharma
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:36.360]  is scared of him.
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:37.720]  And they know he's a good guy.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:39.360]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:44.440]  I don't want to get him in more trouble, but the system already knows that Dr. Oz knows
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:51.400]  about the New World Order, Dr. Oz knows about Gardasil, Dr. Oz has tried to get stuff on
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:58.240]  air and been shot down by network lawyers, so they want to destroy him.
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:01.720]  And Kevin Trudeau was a charlatan in many respects.
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:05.880]  I didn't want him to be shot down because some of the books he wrote about herbs and
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:10.160]  stuff were accurate, in my view, and if they could shoot him down, they could then destroy
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:12.560]  Dr. Oz or anybody else.
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:20.360]  So yeah, now they're going to go after people like Dr. Oz because he dares to be one of
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:22.680]  the few good things on mainstream media.
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:27.440]  And I'm glad you raised that point, so we should try to stand beside him.
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:29.800]  But now they just intend for him to shut up.
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:31.640]  This is his warning.
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:33.520]  And if he doesn't shut up, they'll come after him.
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:37.280]  But what would happen if everybody started telling the truth?
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:39.520]  They couldn't get rid of every CBS reporter.
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:41.040]  They couldn't get rid of Dr. Oz.
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:42.400]  They couldn't get rid of Matt Drudge.
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:43.880]  They couldn't get rid of WorldNet Daily.
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:45.360]  They couldn't get rid of Enfalle Wars.
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:49.840]  They couldn't get rid of, see, that's why we've all got to start our own media and that's
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:54.880]  why we've got to support media that tries to tell the truth and breaks news.
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:55.880]  God bless you.
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:56.880]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:02.720]  Yeah, over the years, I've talked to a lot of people that, oh, Dr. Oz, you know, says
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:03.720]  he likes your show.
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:05.720]  Oh, Dr. Oz knows about a lot more.
[02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:06.720]  He's trying to get this on the air.
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:12.880]  Because I've had a lot of guests on the show that have worked with Dr. Oz, been on his
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:15.720]  show, or done other things behind the scenes with him.
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:19.720]  And so I've always been told he's a good guy and that's been evidenced.
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:21.240]  Let's go to Jonathan in Missouri.
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:22.240]  You're on the air.
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:23.240]  Thanks for holding.
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:24.240]  Go ahead.
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:25.240]  Go ahead, Jonathan.
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:26.240]  You're on the air from Missouri.
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:27.240]  You want to talk about the riots?
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:28.240]  Go ahead.
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:33.040]  Okay, we'll move on, see who comes back.
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.040]  Mitchell in Oregon.
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:35.040]  Thanks for calling.
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:36.040]  Go ahead.
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:45.840]  Yeah, I like to salute from up here in Oregon, look at you as a colonel, exposing so much
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:52.080]  and we're so thankful for your courage and your ability to spread the word.
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:53.080]  That's a great thing.
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:18:00.040]  I wanted to ask you, have you ever heard of the 22 degree halo?
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:01.040]  No, I haven't.
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:06.080]  Well, that's a term, I haven't heard of it until recently either.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:11.240]  It came from one of our local meteorologists and it's pretty interesting.
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:19.800]  He said that they call it the 22 degree halo now when you can see the chemical halo around
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:22.200]  the sun and they don't know.
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:27.080]  So I have heard of a chemical halo because of all the barium salts, aluminum dioxide,
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:31.480]  other things being sprayed, that's being added to jet fuel, even the pilots don't know.
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:37.600]  Yes, I mean, I was aware of the rainbow halo of chemicals that can also be formed by smog.
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:40.120]  So yes, I was aware of chemical halos.
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:43.320]  I was not aware of 22 degree halos.
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:47.560]  Well, it's not, you know, he mentioned that.
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:48.560]  No, no, no, no.
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:50.440]  I mean, we Googled it is a meteorology term.
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:51.440]  You're correct.
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:19:00.480]  Well, he never starts it off with how they're much more evident after we have all these
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:05.160]  cloud-shaped like serpents that come out of the ends of these airplanes.
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:07.680]  You know, I'm old school.
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:14.280]  I remember looking up at the sky and seeing stagecoaches and bow and arrows and little
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:15.280]  things in the sky.
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:22.440]  Now all we see are these, like I say, serpent-shaped clouds that exit the tail ends of planes.
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:24.440]  And they're calling it natural.
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:25.440]  No, I know.
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:29.880]  I mean, condensation trails never lasted more than a few minutes until the mid-1990s.
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:33.800]  And it turns out there's a guy that got a Nobel Prize in 1992.
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:35.520]  I forget the scientist's name.
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:40.200]  For having an added to the jet fuel, the patents, so that no one would know what was going on.
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:43.280]  It's done at the industrial level with the jet fuel.
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.560]  That's why you'll see a plane right in my other plane not spraying it, and then it aerosolizes

[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:07.200]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity

[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:23.480]  Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers' investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:24.480]  IRAs?
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:25.480]  Wait a sec.
[02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:29.920]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next dead increase,
[02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:31.680]  and there's no end to this madness.

[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:16.640]  I'm with DeAndre Smith, and this is exactly what's supposed to happen when an injustice
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:18.280]  is happening in your community.
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:21.400]  When you have kids getting killed for nothing.
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:24.840]  When they out here minding their business, you can lock them up.
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:26.000]  You can teach them.
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  You can mow them.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  At the same time, you ain't got to kill them.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000]  He ain't got no gun in his hands.
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  Why you kill him?
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.200]  You say Trayvon had a hoodie on, you didn't know what was going on with him.
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:35.200]  He ain't have no hoodie on.
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:37.680]  His hands was up when you shot him.
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:38.680]  So what's your excuse?
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:39.680]  I was here.
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:40.680]  I was here.
[02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:41.680]  I was out here.
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:45.480]  That's all I can say.
[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:48.880]  I was out here with the community.
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.280]  That's all I can say.
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:53.280]  I was out here standing side by side with the community.
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:56.800]  I mean, I don't think it's over.
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:01.320]  Honestly, I think they just got a taste of what fighting back means.
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:04.000]  I think they got to say something.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  In St. Louis.
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  In St. Louis.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  The last state to abolish slavery.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.080]  Do they think they still have power over certain things?
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:15.240]  I believe so because they doing stuff like this and getting away with it.
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:16.240]  People ain't saying nothing.
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:18.320]  They not doing nothing across the country.
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:20.560]  They not going for it here.
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:21.560]  St. Louis ain't going for it.
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:22.560]  This is how they eat here.
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:24.560]  This is how they receive money.
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:29.400]  Businesses, the taxes, police stopping people, giving them tickets, taking them to court,
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:30.400]  locking them up.
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:33.080]  That's how they make money in St. Louis, right?
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:34.080]  Traffic.
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:36.480]  Everything is all about money in St. Louis, right?
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:45.960]  So when you stop their flow of income, when you stop their whole everything, their business,
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:49.640]  they organize, they have certain things in a certain way, right?
[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:51.520]  Secret society type of deal, right?
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.480]  We're going to eat and you guys are going to starve.
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:54.480]  Gentrification.
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:58.960]  Put you in a certain neighborhood by yourself and see if you can starve in a proper way.
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:25:59.960]  It's not going to happen.
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:00.960]  Not in St. Louis.
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:07.640]  You know, the funny thing about Mr. Smith is some of what he says has some truth to
[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:13.880]  it, but it's not a white versus black thing and burning up stores in the area will just
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:17.120]  make people leave the area and not give you jobs.
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:27.520]  I hear somebody off the corner say, let's burn down the city hall.
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:32.720]  But I guess in this country, Saudi Arabia reportedly attacked us on 9-11 if you believe
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:34.880]  the official's story.
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:36.640]  So we attacked Iraq.
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:39.360]  So a cop shoots an innocent black guy according to them.
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:40.360]  Maybe it's true.
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:42.960]  It's happened before.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:51.400]  And so they attack shoe stores and grocery stores and people's houses.
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:57.240]  If there's a perception that a white person owns it, I mean, it's just, it's just, it's
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:26:59.120]  totally race-based.
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:02.000]  And then they think everybody else is race-based.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  Just bizarre.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  Absolutely bizarre.
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:11.600]  Randy in Texas on the St. Louis riot, which again is a portend of things to come in my
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:12.600]  view.
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:13.600]  So go ahead.
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:14.600]  You're on the air.
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:15.600]  Yes, Alex.
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:20.640]  Let me give you a little background information on the St. Louis riot situation and why I
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:27.040]  think the current violence and why St. Louis in particular may be the spark or the catalyst
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:31.960]  for civil disobedience and ultimately maybe martial law.
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:35.760]  By the way, geography is important here because it's actually North St. Louis.
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:39.280]  I know you've said South St. Louis a couple of times today, but it is important that it's
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:40.280]  north of the city.
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:41.280]  No, no, no.
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:45.520]  It's north, but they also had some stuff in South St. Louis that got burned up according
[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:49.600]  to this mainstream news article I have here in the stack or some, or some shops got looted
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:50.720]  last night.
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:51.720]  Another part of the city.
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:53.840]  I mean, I've got an article that says that.
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:54.840]  Is that incorrect?
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:28:01.000]  Well, no, actually there are, there were some threats in the, more the center city or West
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:02.400]  city, which is more the.
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:04.000]  No, I understand it's North St. Louis.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.040]  That's where they had the armored vehicles rolling around a few years ago.
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:08.040]  Remember that?
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:09.040]  That's right.
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:12.680]  The city, two years ago, did the military drills about five to seven miles from where
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:17.880]  all this violence has been taking place in North St. Louis, which is the town of Ferguson.
[02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:18.880]  But let me give you a little background.
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:21.040]  You ever heard of Pruitt-Igo?
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:22.040]  Yes.
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:28.240]  Pruitt-Igo is a large housing project, huge housing project that was built in St. Louis
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:30.040]  in the fifties.
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.480]  And in about 15 to 16 years, it was completely destroyed and they had to tear it down.
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:38.680]  And it was housed entirely by African Americans.
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:41.920]  And they had to relocate all these people from this housing project.
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:45.120]  So they're, they're very, very concentrated in these areas.
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:50.160]  East St. Louis is another area, but this in particular North and Northwest of this housing
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:54.440]  projects is where a lot of these black people moved to.
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:58.280]  And so it's a, it's, it's really a, it's a ticking time bomb, if you will.
[02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:03.160]  And it just, when you start putting all these pieces together and starting to, to connect
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:08.280]  the dots, you can see that behind all of this, the feds and relocating these people and
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:10.480]  getting them concentrated and so forth and so on.
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:15.600]  You can see that they're, and then running these DOD drills, just a few miles from there,
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:20.960]  you can see that this thing is, could possibly be the, the, the spark to this whole, uh,
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:24.640]  well, you know, it's funny that I just went to your call and then you said that I'm going
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:26.800]  to come back to you after this report.
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:32.120]  I was going to dovetail the drills for Marshall law two years ago in the articles and reports
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:38.260]  we did with an army shot-off that was run previously and was going to make that connect
[02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:39.260]  you.
[02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:40.260]  And then you just brought it up.
[02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:41.520]  So Randy, stay there.
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:45.400]  I'm going to come back and we're going to get into that and then I'll come back to you
[02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:48.040]  for the final comment on that subject.

[02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:01.840]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:31:01.840 --> 02:31:07.880]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:13.480]  of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the
[02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:17.360]  planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:22.120]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that's good stuff.
[02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:26.440]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:32.920]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:38.480]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:39.480]  dose.
[02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:41.680]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:45.600]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:50.800]  It's not just the super male vitality, all the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply
[02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:51.800]  amazing.

[02:31:56.560 --> 02:31:58.760]  powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:02.480]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grobe.
[02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:08.160]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:09.920]  iodine available.
[02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:18.360]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine
[02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:20.760]  environmentally clean conditions.
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:28.960]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit
[02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:30.160]  deep in the earth.
[02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:34.760]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:39.080]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:43.440]  Experience the new formula, experience the ancient purity.
[02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:44.880]  Shield your family.
[02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:49.480]  Survival Shield X2, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:49.480 --> 02:32:56.480]  Shield X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll 3-888-253-3139.
[02:32:56.480 --> 02:33:15.720]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:20.520]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:24.720]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:29.320]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:32.120]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:36.240]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those
[02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:39.320]  over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:43.840]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:47.680]  The guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed, we will take all weapons.
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:50.000]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.560]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:55.560]  Enough.
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:56.560]  Enough.
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:57.560]  Enough.
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:33:58.560]  Enough.
[02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:02.280]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:06.320]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:10.720]  MSK's late news 12th Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:13.800]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:17.320]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:20.840]  to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:21.840]  whole communities.
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:28.200]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:33.120]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:34.120]  Pediatrics.
[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:39.320]  Black Hawk choppers soaring to the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:47.520]  Only armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:56.760]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:01.480]  I am in my apartment, sir, I am inside.
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:03.600]  I have two words for you.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:04.600]  Predator gloves.
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:10.400]  You will never see it coming.
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:14.640]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children
[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:18.960]  and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:22.320]  face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:25.200]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in and now they're coming
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:27.720]  in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:34.720]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down if
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:39.720]  you want to commentate on it.
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:40.720]  We are on the march.
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:41.720]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:47.720]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:35:47.720 --> 02:36:03.480]  See, when we protest the attack on the Second Amendment, we go down in March in San Antonio,
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:08.520]  where they claim it's illegal to have firearms loaded openly, and we exercised our Second
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:13.320]  Amendment and the police were forced to back down and admit they were following an illegal
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:19.120]  law that violated state law that trumps the city ordinance.
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:24.320]  We didn't go down to San Antonio and burn down random shopkeepers' buildings.
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:29.680]  We went in and asked them to put little American flags in the window if they wanted open carry
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:31.840]  people to come into their businesses.
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:41.080]  And every business, every business except one chain operation wanted us to come in.
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:43.560]  Now, let's look at the big Psyop.
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:46.640]  You notice that intro has been running about a year.
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:49.360]  Darren McBrain put it together.
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:55.880]  And you see clips from two years ago in East St. Louis where they admitted it was martial
[02:36:55.880 --> 02:37:05.640]  law drills with regular army, not just National Guard, with wheeled tanks driving around in
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:09.200]  the very area where this happened in North St. Louis.
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:14.000]  There's also been some stuff down in South St. Louis over not a few windows getting broken
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.320]  up, nothing compared to things being burned down.
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:22.160]  And the attitude is, you heard that protester earlier who said he was part of it, is this
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:29.240]  will bring down the system, burning up a little grocery store, mini mart, and some shoe stores
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:33.840]  and some dollar stores, and no, they just get a big insurance check and now you don't
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:38.920]  have a place to buy gas or go in and get a loaf of bread.
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:46.720]  And it creates these urban deserts where no one wants to locate their businesses.
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:53.880]  And then it's called gentrification whenever any people do move into the area.
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:38:00.440]  So do you want to just stay in your housing and have nothing around you but a welfare
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:01.440]  check?
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:05.800]  See, that's why you're between a rock and a hard place.
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:09.560]  And look, I don't expect folks, I mean, the general public, people with PhDs can't figure
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:10.560]  out the new world order.
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:17.760]  So I'm not even blaming these poor folks that are multi-generational welfare.
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:21.800]  They at least, though, are getting that it's part of a larger agenda and they're talking
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:26.880]  about secret societies, at least they get what some of the general public doesn't understand.
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:34.680]  But you notice that you've got this urban warfare drill going on in East St. Louis and
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:39.320]  they went ahead and admitted two years ago in the newscast that you can go watch from
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:48.400]  our article, Don't Be Alarmed, Army Trains, MPs to drive tanks on U.S. streets.
[02:38:48.400 --> 02:38:54.480]  That's one of the reports from June of 2012, U.S. Army admits troops conducting law enforcement
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:57.760]  is illegal is another story.
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:00.120]  And they're there helping the police.
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:05.320]  They shot video a decade ago of Marines in Alabama setting up real checkpoints on highway
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:10.560]  searching people happened a few years ago in Tennessee, a few years ago in Central California.
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:17.360]  They had Marines with sidearms doing DWI checkpoints on major highways.
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:20.120]  That was in the local California papers.
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:23.400]  I had the reporters on.
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:27.920]  So they are preparing the military to be used against the American people, not just for
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:35.240]  collapse of society, but for DWI checkpoints, total violation of positive commentatus that's
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:43.400]  been overturned to a great extent in the last few defense authorization acts under Bush
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:45.280]  and now Obama.
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:52.600]  But when you see urban warfare drills all over the country with troops on the streets
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:58.720]  and helicopters and National Guard and regular Army and State Guard at the kite festival
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:04.800]  or at the symphony orchestra or at the football game, searching bags while the borders wide
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:05.800]  open.
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:10.520]  A real terrorist would walk up to the line of people that's most concentrated and blow
[02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:12.080]  themselves up there.
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.880]  So it's a fake threat.
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:18.360]  Our government's giving stinger missiles to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:23.240]  Our government's got our borders wide open, but all over the country now, Army and National
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:33.560]  Guard are at the Bay Fest in Alabama or the kite festival in Austin, Texas, just to condition
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:42.400]  you to live under this or at the Amtrak station with the TSA in Minnesota or Illinois or Houston,
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:43.400]  Texas.
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:49.040]  Now, I talked to major police chiefs, San Antonio police chief at the time, a good guy,
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:53.640]  Ali Philippus, back in 1998 and ended up being a national news story.
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:58.560]  I talked to emergency managers in places like Kingsville who themselves had been in military
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:00.760]  Army intelligence so they understood what was happening.
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:07.720]  They were told by Delta Force and told by the Pentagon, Bill Clinton's looking at martial
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:08.720]  law.
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:14.800]  This is in, my police say, 2000 film and here's a bag of money, $200,000.
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:18.200]  We want you to take this just to show your friends, just to compromise them.
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:21.280]  They could then later claim it was a bribe and arrest them.
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:27.280]  Take this for America, $200,000 was the average bribe.
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:29.120]  They came to Austin as well.
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:33.400]  The Austin, the Travis County SWAT team didn't take the money in so they fired to out of
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:34.400]  it.
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:37.440]  Well, the SWAT team was just blown away when Delta Force showed up like I told them they
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:38.800]  would six months before.
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:41.880]  They were going to every major city buying everybody off.
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:44.680]  They were laughing at me the first time I went in those six months later like, my God,
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:45.680]  come into my office.
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:47.080]  It's all real, everything you said.
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:51.080]  I mean, look, this is how they take over third world countries.
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:55.080]  This is how the Nazis took over France two years before they invaded.
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:42:01.240]  They had 90 plus percent of the general staff, that's generals, down to other commissioned
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:07.840]  officers, right down to non-commissioned, paid off, ready with new positions to run France
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.680]  when the Germans came in, if they would stand down.
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:15.840]  The French stood down.
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:17.000]  That's important to understand.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.880]  It's the same deal.
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:21.000]  So the military's running this Psyop.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:26.120]  I've got a radio show in 96, 97, 98.
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:29.800]  I'm told about this by army folks that are upset about it and others.
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:31.320]  I go investigate.
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:34.200]  Suddenly they're coming to me because I'm somebody that will talk about it.
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:37.800]  I don't understand any of it at the time.
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:39.600]  I start getting threatened.
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:42.440]  I've got military trying to set me up.
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:47.200]  I mean, literally jumping out of the bushes when I'm at an event lighting fires and saying,
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:50.560]  why'd you light a fire, Alex?
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:52.680]  So I mean, I was like in a spy movie.
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:56.160]  I'd only been on air about a year and a half.
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:43:00.120]  And suddenly I've got NSA whistleblowers and military whistleblowers.
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:01.120]  So I talk about the military.
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:02.600]  I'm not attacking the military.
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:05.880]  They're more awake than anybody else because they don't like what's happening.
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:10.280]  They know they're training to take on the Tea Party and gun owners and veterans.
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:13.120]  They knew that before it was declassified, before I even told you, because they were
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:15.040]  going through the training.
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:20.040]  It's the command that's bad.
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:25.040]  And so suddenly there are any St. Louis and what they'll do, one of the highest crime
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:29.480]  rates in the country is in Chicago and other areas where they're calling for army to be
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:30.480]  on the streets.
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:36.000]  They'll set the precedent for troops on the streets for poor areas that are having riots
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:41.080]  as the economic depression accelerates and as MSNBC promotes race war, a.k.a. Trayvon
[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:46.000]  Martin, it turned out the Justice Department did have agent provocateurs, remember this
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.800]  came out down there running the whole thing with the lawyer.
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:56.640]  Just like they've got people dressed up like Klan members going to Rand Paul events, their
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:00.200]  Democratic Party operatives, and then we catch them so they got to back off.
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:05.440]  They're trying to stir stuff up with agent provocateurs.
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:10.240]  We've been dealing with them, you know, as of late and it's just part of what goes on
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:14.680]  that you're at the grocery store and somebody walks up and says, Hey, let's kill cops together.
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:17.320]  And it's clearly a cop you're talking to show.
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:21.520]  So this is what they do folks trying to stir stuff up.
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:27.560]  And so yes, they could easily use a real event that happens or use an event where the cops
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:32.680]  haven't shot somebody in cold blood to hype it up with Al Sharpton to get riots going
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:37.120]  and then to set the precedent to have a whole bunch of Katrina like events where they take
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:38.440]  everybody's guns.
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:41.360]  They didn't go into the eighth ward and take the guns into Orleans.
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:47.960]  They went into areas with five and $10 million famous homes and took the guns out of their
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:53.800]  safes, turned off their generators and moved the army into their houses and handcuffed
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:56.800]  millionaire citizens with no criminal record.
[02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:02.880]  So they'll use the cops and others looting the Walmarts to then go to the high and dry
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:07.880]  areas where people have got power and everything and they will take over your house and the
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:11.120]  military didn't like it, but they were ordered to do it.
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:21.680]  So that's the precedent, use the welfare class to be the pretext to sell the ideas
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:26.120]  of the takeover and to prime the pump and then it's just a permanent police state that's
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:27.120]  in place.
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:31.920]  And again, the constant military drills, the constant troops on the streets, the helicopters
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:38.320]  landing at the public school is part of a desensitization program that's been going on since Bill Clinton
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:44.840]  got in office in 1993 and has expanded since Obama got into office.
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:54.760]  And I remember at the time when I was learning about all this in 1998, watching a show sworn
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:46:03.800]  to secrecy that was on television, it's a 65 hour documentary television series about
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:09.520]  military history and the secrets of war in the 20th century.
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:16.480]  It was 65 episodes, the series premiered on the history channel in September of 1998
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:21.080]  where it prevailed in its eight o'clock Sunday evening slot for over two years.
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:27.200]  The series was co-created and it goes through and it was narrated by Charlton Heston.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:35.160]  Now the invasion of Panama was episode 14, season one, with Charlton Heston, who I'm
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:37.840]  proud to have known.
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:45.840]  The point is that when you listen to Chuck talking, he's talking about how they sigh
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:53.560]  up the Panamanians before they actually invaded for a year before they did it.
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:57.480]  And then they said that the Panamanian government had kidnapped college students, but when the
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:46:59.800]  media got there, they said, nobody kidnapped us.
[02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:06.600]  It was all staged, I'm not defending the Panamanian dictator.
[02:47:06.600 --> 02:47:10.400]  The point was is that Manuel Noriega started talking about how our government was dealing
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:15.600]  cocaine with him and that he shouldn't be getting blamed for having a $45 million Swiss
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:18.200]  mega chalet.
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:23.240]  And so they simply invaded the country, took him over and shot him up because the CIA didn't
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:28.320]  want that known and used a bunch of high-tech weapons to just indiscriminately blow up whole
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:30.120]  highways of people.
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:36.000]  And I mean, they had all sorts of high-tech stuff they were using.
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:40.240]  But the issue is they talk about how they trained to make the public and the military
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:46.920]  and the locals stand down when they actually invaded for months practicing the invasion.
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:52.920]  To acclimate and desensitize, that's what this is today and it's gone from a scale
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:48:03.800]  of 1 to 100, being about a 10 under Clinton and then staying at about a 10, 15, 20 under
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:07.520]  Bush and then now under Obama, it's gone up to about a 90.
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:12.480]  I mean, they're doing not just drills, but real law enforcement everywhere and training
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:17.240]  to take on the Tea Party and the drills, that's Forbes magazine, Associated Press,
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:22.480]  Washington Post, and saying their main enemy is the gun owner, is the veteran.
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:25.120]  So this is real, this is happening.
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:29.800]  So understand, this is a premeditated psi-op to condition the police, the military, the
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:33.200]  general public, everyone that this is normal and okay.
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:40.000]  And remember, when this psi-op first began in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, people would come
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.600]  up to me and say, when I was first on air in 95 and say, why don't you cover the black
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:44.920]  helicopters?
[02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:46.440]  They just hit East St. Louis.
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:49.520]  I remember that was one of the first ones I ever heard of.
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:51.120]  Why don't you cover the black helicopters?
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:54.720]  They just crashed in Houston and I'd go, you're nuts.
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:58.880]  That's what crazies talk about because I was a mainline conservative until I saw it for
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:06.960]  myself and covered it and was called a conspiracy theorist on the news in the front page of
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:08.840]  the paper.
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:12.200]  And then suddenly had like military guys in the parking lot and playing clothes, getting
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:15.480]  on both sides of me saying, you're not playing any terrorist attacks, are you?
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:16.720]  I was like, excuse me?
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:17.880]  Yeah, because you are.
[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:22.880]  You're going to get hurt real bad.
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:27.440]  And I mean, FBI agents showing up, I mean, it was just, you know, telling me I better
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:28.440]  watch it.
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:34.080]  I'm like, you're, it was just, it's just, it's just, there's a secret takedown of America
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:35.080]  that's now public.
[02:49:35.080 --> 02:49:38.960]  They've got the preachers, they've got infregards, they've got most of the doctors.
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:42.000]  I mean, this is bad, folks, and it's not to keep the country safe.
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:43.520]  The border is wide open.
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:49.760]  Let's go to Charlton Heston, just 30 seconds from the television show where he broke all
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:51.720]  this down, sworn to secrecy.
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:52.720]  Here it is.
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:54.600]  We were jerking them and that's what we wanted to do.
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:58.160]  We would wake them up at two or three in the morning and they would go on alert and they
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:02.640]  would go on alert and, and, and we were just doing it over and over and over again.
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:07.760]  It got to the point that when we would do them, they would not go on alert anymore.
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:13.640]  These and flea exercises were a major secret of success for Operation Just Cause.
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:18.600]  The Panamanians were desensitized to US troop movements, allowing the Americans to achieve
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:25.800]  a greater degree of tactical surprise during the invasion.
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:28.240]  And the whole show is on YouTube.
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:29.240]  We should find that.
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:33.960]  And I, I know I've seen it and have them post it, you know, tomorrow with my breakdown
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:40.680]  here, uh, 2mpholwars.com, our prisonplanet.com or both, we're going to come back and finish
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:42.840]  up with Randy, but here's the deal.
[02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:44.280]  It's premeditated.
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:46.080]  It's been going on for decades.
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:47.080]  It's coming to a head.
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:49.280]  Is the big fat pimple going to pop?
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:50.280]  I don't know.
[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:51.280]  It looks like it is.
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:52.280]  Okay.
[02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:57.920]  And it'll probably pop when they blow up federal buildings and blame it on Rush Limbaugh and
[02:50:57.920 --> 02:50:58.920]  Al Shucks.
[02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:05.200]  Do you ever feel like you live in an alternate universe as the stock market hits new highs?
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:07.840]  The middle class are dying.
[02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:12.720]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures, chaos on our border, China and Russia
[02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:14.640]  bypassing the dollar.
[02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:16.440]  Life is getting ready to change.
[02:51:16.440 --> 02:51:19.480]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.

[02:51:59.640 --> 02:52:02.360]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:07.800]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[02:52:07.800 --> 02:52:11.160]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[02:52:11.160 --> 02:52:15.280]  direction this country was headed and the Charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick
[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:16.280]  buck.
[02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:20.200]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[02:52:20.200 --> 02:52:24.240]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:29.400]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American
[02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:30.400]  men and women.
[02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:33.400]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:38.720]  And that's why I stock MyPatriot with high quality, storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.

[02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:07.360]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important, certainly not in my 22
[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:08.760]  years in the industry.
[02:53:08.760 --> 02:53:12.720]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:16.520]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:53:16.520 --> 02:53:17.880]  Ours is not immune.
[02:53:17.880 --> 02:53:19.800]  The time is now to be proactive.

[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:32.080]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:33.080]  So decide.
[02:53:33.080 --> 02:53:36.480]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[02:53:36.480 --> 02:53:37.880]  The choice is yours.
[02:53:37.880 --> 02:53:48.560]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116, that's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.

[02:54:54.600 --> 02:55:01.000]  Thousands of products, films, books, t-shirts that are as low as $10 apiece, made in America

[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:26.160]  Now Common Core says we could say promo code 9, but no, no, no, the computer only recognized

[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:32.520]  I know it's a conspiracy theory to say 10 is 10, but it is.
[02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:34.720]  That's racist as well.
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:40.680]  But please continue to support us as you are so we can continue to operate and expand.
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:45.960]  I mean, if I'm going to put my life on trying to defeat the globalist, I'm going to go all
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:46.960]  the way.
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:49.800]  We will do five minutes of overdrive to be able to finish with everybody.
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:57.320]  Randy, I kind of did a whole jag for 18 minute segment going back to the genesis of my true
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:02.960]  awakening as a talk show host who was willing to cover real issues, learning about Bill
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:09.160]  Clinton and the proto homeland security that he proposed, preparing to take over the states
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:12.880]  and wage war on conservatives and libertarians.
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:20.640]  Now this is all public, but yes, they've been preparing East St. Louis as a detonation point
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:27.880]  for a while, and so I'm glad that you brought up that issue, do you have any points on what
[02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:28.880]  I just said?
[02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:29.880]  Yes, Alex.
[02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:35.280]  By the way, I got DNA force last week.
[02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:38.800]  I just wanted to tell you that the geography here is very important.
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:42.440]  St. Louis itself is very important, and I want to correct you.
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:43.440]  It's not East St. Louis.
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:45.760]  East St. Louis is on the east side of the Mississippi River.
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:46.760]  I know it's north.
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:47.760]  It's north.
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:48.760]  I know I'm brain dead.
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:55.160]  Alex, this is very important because the Mississippi River envelops three quarters of
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:57.120]  greater St. Louis.
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:57:02.200]  So if there's some kind of a pusher or disturbance, it's all going to move from the north end
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:06.400]  of the community to the south, and to the south is where the rich people, the white
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:10.240]  people, the average people, the Hispanic, everybody else lived.
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:15.760]  And this is set up purposely in the city where they did these DOD drills is actually
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:23.200]  between where this Pruitt-Igo urban housing project, the greatest federal disaster ever
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:27.240]  in a housing project and where this Ferguson is.
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:31.720]  It's right there, and you talked about the stuff moving south or south St. Louis.
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:35.720]  What actually happened was there were people that were starting to move out of that area,
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:40.240]  and they moved to the mall on the west side of town, which is south of St. Louis.
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:41.240]  No, no, I understand.
[02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:42.240]  I understand.
[02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:43.240]  You know the area.
[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:44.240]  You're informed.
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:45.240]  Try talking for three hours.
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:47.560]  No, I know it's north St. Louis.
[02:57:47.560 --> 02:57:51.280]  They had these drills in East St. Louis and the north, correct?
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:52.280]  Two years ago.
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:54.560]  I mean, I don't want to get caught in my new show.
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:56.920]  The point is this is a key strategic area.
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:57:58.760]  Why was the military there before?
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:57:59.760]  Yes.
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:04.800]  Well, it's key strategic because of the geography and the way the Mississippi River would basically
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:06.560]  provide a barrier for people.
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:10.680]  If they were to flee, you can't go anywhere but one direction.
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:12.200]  It's very, very, very important there.
[02:58:12.200 --> 02:58:13.200]  No, you're right.
[02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:17.520]  It looked almost like a peninsula.
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:22.360]  But the threat was to the mall where there's Nordstrom and Macy's and all these others.
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:24.320]  It was the better areas.
[02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:29.640]  That's what they shut down the mall last night in the gallery.
[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:30.640]  Interesting, Randy.
[02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:31.640]  Very interesting points.
[02:58:31.640 --> 02:58:35.040]  Well, thank you for helping us out with that.
[02:58:35.040 --> 02:58:36.640]  Bottom line, they're preparing for martial law.
[02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:39.360]  I don't want to miss the forest with the trees here.
[02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:40.360]  The question is why?
[02:58:40.360 --> 02:58:41.360]  The question is when?
[02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:42.360]  You are referring to G.C.
[02:58:42.360 --> 02:58:44.360]  N.S.S. for security with the border wide open.
[02:58:44.360 --> 02:58:45.360]  This is G.C.N.I.
[02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:46.360]  That's the issue.
[02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:50.080]  Overdrive coming up, nightly news tonight at 7 o'clock.
[02:58:50.080 --> 02:58:52.080]  This is Scotys John for infowars.com.
[02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:56.880]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics
[02:58:56.880 --> 02:58:59.200]  and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:02.000]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:03.640]  If not, then I want to know why.
[02:59:03.640 --> 02:59:06.240]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:10.560]  They might call you names or they just want to talk about sports or soap operas.
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:12.560]  I say, so what?
[02:59:12.560 --> 02:59:14.080]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:17.480]  The ammunition is information and the soldiers are you.
[02:59:17.480 --> 02:59:21.720]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[02:59:21.720 --> 02:59:25.600]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand
[02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:27.520]  years and I'm still fighting.
[02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:30.760]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[02:59:30.760 --> 02:59:32.640]  The InfoWars is worldwide.
[02:59:32.640 --> 02:59:36.920]  Tell your friends about InfoWars and let them know that InfoWars doesn't print bull.
[02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:40.680]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:47.880]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:50.880]  The truth will set them free.
[02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:54.640]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.640 --> 02:59:58.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:58.560 --> 03:00:10.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:11.800]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.800 --> 03:00:13.800]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:18.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:30.920]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:36.920]  Robin Williams, a great comedic actor, found dead and now confirmed it was a belt around
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:37.920]  his neck.
[03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:43.920]  Here's he committed suicide, had money troubles, thought his career was faltering, was depressed.
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:49.120]  Now imagine if we could have gotten him awakened to the New World Order and to go out and try
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:54.560]  to warn people about what was happening instead of being on the Hollywood Reservation and
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:59.320]  looks like committing suicide over not being famous enough or whatever.
[03:00:59.320 --> 03:01:07.920]  So sad, so sad to be in that position and to have all that promise in the years he had
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:10.440]  left and to kill himself.
[03:01:10.440 --> 03:01:14.960]  Let's talk to Max in Wisconsin, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:17.760]  Hello, Mr. King of Reality.
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:23.120]  I have killed thousands of spiders and watched them sucked into the blackness tangled in
[03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:24.120]  their own web.
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:29.840]  The pyramid has no top where we all live in the realm of oneness, of the circle, God,
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:31.360]  the master builder.
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:37.680]  Even the 360th right and the fart like Mariah has already failed by blinding themselves
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:41.240]  with the dim light of phallic measuring egotism.
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:51.040]  I call to remind them that verified from my own experience, justice in equal measure awaits.
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:52.040]  Sounds very interesting.
[03:01:52.040 --> 03:01:55.320]  You want to talk about Illuminati and Eugenics is what it says on the board.
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:01:58.320]  Anything else?
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:01.480]  Not keep up the good work.
[03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:02.480]  Thank you for the call.
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:08.120]  Let's talk to Adrian from Missouri says has inside info on the riots.
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:09.120]  Thanks for calling Adrian.
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:10.120]  Go ahead.
[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:11.120]  Hi.
[03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:12.120]  How are you doing, Alex?
[03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:13.120]  Good, sir.
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:14.120]  Go ahead.
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:15.120]  Tell us what happened.
[03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:22.080]  Hey, yes, I was at the Ferguson protest rallies yesterday and the day before.
[03:02:22.080 --> 03:02:26.000]  But what they did yesterday was totally uncalled for.
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:31.880]  They had riot police out there in full tactical gear and while everybody who was across the
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:39.880]  street and we were protesting patiently, we were protesting peacefully and right around
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:46.560]  the time of right before the 12 o'clock mark, they told us that we had to disassemble and
[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:48.440]  we had to move along.
[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:53.320]  Now for my recollection, I don't think that there's an expiration date on your first
[03:02:53.320 --> 03:02:55.800]  amendment right to write the peaceful protest.
[03:02:55.800 --> 03:03:02.040]  I don't think that you close to have an expiration date, but they told us to move out of the
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:04.680]  street and put us on the sidewalk.
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:05.680]  Now we're on the sidewalk.
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:06.680]  The public sidewalk.
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:07.880]  We can protest all we want.
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:08.880]  All right.
[03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:12.120]  Long as we're not impeding traffic, okay?
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:17.600]  And what they did at the 12 o'clock mark, everybody started moving to another part of
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:24.320]  the city to go protest, but the ones that were still standing there, they told the media,
[03:03:24.320 --> 03:03:26.160]  the local news crew to leave.
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:27.160]  They did a media blackout.
[03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:31.680]  No, no, I don't like the fact they've been kicking the media out and we've seen police
[03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:35.280]  shoot people before who aren't armed and then try to cover it up.
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:39.760]  I don't know if that's the case, but I mean, obviously it stinks.
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:42.760]  And so, but it's two different issues.
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:47.080]  People demonstrating should have the right to do that, but when you've already got looting
[03:03:47.080 --> 03:03:51.760]  and stuff going on, it'll be used to suspend everybody's rights, which is why they want
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:55.160]  to stir this up on MSNBC and other places.
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:56.160]  So I hear what you're saying.
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:59.960]  In fact, I'd like to get your name and number and have you on the nightly news for like
[03:03:59.960 --> 03:04:06.720]  10 minutes tonight so you can give us, you know, your real perspective and also document
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:10.760]  for us that you're indeed there and maybe you can show my crew around when they get
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:11.760]  there tonight or tomorrow.
[03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:12.760]  Sir.
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:13.760]  How's that sound?
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:14.760]  That sounds perfect.
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:15.760]  All right.
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:16.760]  Guys.
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:17.760]  Thank you, sir.
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:25.600]  Guys, get Adrian's name and number and then give it to Jacarie and Biggs and Josh and
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:27.440]  everybody else before they go.
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:29.400]  They haven't already gone yet.
[03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:32.080]  And let's try to get him on the nightly news.
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:35.760]  So let's get Adrian's number over to who's in the nightly news now is it Lee Ann or
[03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:37.760]  McBrain or is it Jacarie?
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:38.760]  Yeah.
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:39.760]  Okay.
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:42.760]  I guess Jacarie is going up to St. Louis.
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:44.040]  All right, folks.
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:49.040]  I'm sorry to other callers, Mad Wit, Dee, Darlene and others.
[03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:50.040]  I got to go.
[03:04:50.040 --> 03:04:51.040]  Nightly News 97.
[03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:54.480]  If you call back those callers, I'll go to the headline for you.
[03:04:54.480 --> 03:04:55.800]  Thank you for calling in.
[03:04:55.800 --> 03:04:57.720]  Alex Jones signing off for now.
[03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:16.400]  I wish you all a good night, and I wish you all a good night.
