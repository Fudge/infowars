[01:12.040 --> 01:18.920]  or the pickle or the dilemma I've got to cover all the news it's it's just all
[01:18.920 --> 01:22.200]  off the charts getting more insane by the minute confirming all of our
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.960]  analysis about the globalist and their plans from police state to censorship to
[01:26.960 --> 01:32.800]  massive taxation with the cashless society being used to absolutely rape
[01:32.800 --> 01:37.360]  everyone and destroy the economy by design while they do it once they put
[01:37.360 --> 01:41.560]  the cashless system in place completely you think five bucks to use your ATM is
[01:41.560 --> 01:47.200]  going to be bad there's going to be all these global taxes you name it we're
[01:47.200 --> 01:51.360]  already seeing it in Europe under the engineered austerity that we told you in
[01:51.360 --> 01:55.880]  99 was coming once they imploded the derivative scandal we predicted right
[01:55.880 --> 02:01.360]  around 2011 2012 because it's all a plan you can see the progression of it
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.080]  there's not even really dots to connect it's like one of those connect the dots
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.640]  you give a three-year-old where the numbers are right beside each other and
[02:09.640 --> 02:13.720]  you can see that it's a dinosaur or you can see that it's a parakeet you can
[02:13.720 --> 02:19.080]  see it's a horse a monkey a kitty cat I mean you don't even need to connect the
[02:19.080 --> 02:25.960]  dots I mean it's like a jigsaw puzzle that's got 500 pieces and 495 of them
[02:25.960 --> 02:30.400]  are in place there's five more little pieces to stick in I mean it's not hard
[02:30.400 --> 02:36.880]  not hard but if you're unconscious and still believe the old propaganda that
[02:36.880 --> 02:42.280]  there's no global elite there's no special insider interest that there's
[02:42.280 --> 02:48.160]  nothing corrupt going on just trust the nice people that run the government and
[02:48.160 --> 02:53.960]  the big corporations that have bought and paid for them never mind everything is
[02:53.960 --> 03:02.000]  just so wonderful and then the system sits there with bought and paid for
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.840]  prostitute prostitute media pointing at those of us that are awake and live in
[03:06.840 --> 03:10.640]  the real world and go ha ha ha they think there's a corrupt government a
[03:10.640 --> 03:13.800]  global corporate government being set up when it's in all the admitted documents
[03:13.800 --> 03:17.600]  world leaders are all admitting it they're like ha ha look they're they're
[03:17.600 --> 03:21.960]  reporting on absolute admitted facts ha ha ha and they count on people being so
[03:21.960 --> 03:29.280]  into trendiness so into peer pressure that they laugh at us it still happens
[03:29.280 --> 03:34.600]  not as much as it used to instead a lot of people now aren't laughing they're
[03:34.600 --> 03:39.400]  going okay you're right about this what do we do we don't have any power ladies
[03:39.400 --> 03:42.800]  and gentlemen they wouldn't be setting up this police state and openly trying to
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.000]  censor the internet and I got some really bad news on the internet front I
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.440]  mean this is moving quicker than I thought you think we dodged a bullet on
[03:50.440 --> 03:55.480]  sopa that's like if you got a firing squad of 20 guys in front of you all
[03:55.480 --> 04:01.200]  aiming 30 odd sixes at you at 10 yards away and one idiot miss fires and misses
[04:01.200 --> 04:07.680]  you and as I said it's because the global corporations they want the
[04:07.680 --> 04:11.960]  decisions and entreaties that private corporations are signing on to with
[04:11.960 --> 04:17.200]  governments they want to be the enforcers not government we're entering this
[04:17.200 --> 04:22.320]  phase now where the extreme privatization is nothing but government
[04:22.320 --> 04:27.460]  signing government powers illegally over to mega corporations remember the
[04:27.460 --> 04:35.160]  100 biggest economies more than half of them are corporations of the one look it
[04:35.160 --> 04:41.240]  up of the 100 biggest economies how do you look it up put it in an essay crystal
[04:41.240 --> 04:47.120]  ball Google system just that's what it is put the info in you'll see
[04:47.120 --> 04:54.360]  them saying it but the 100 biggest economies 50 plus years goes like 51

[08:39.720 --> 08:45.280]  talk about Google's new user policies where they admit that basically
[08:45.280 --> 08:49.000]  everything you do is going to be tracked and going to be used and going to be
[08:49.000 --> 08:56.280]  tied together from all Google platforms from Google smartphones the droids
[08:56.280 --> 09:02.320]  right through to your searches to to where you shop online to your habits to
[09:02.320 --> 09:06.320]  the movies you're purchasing your psychological profile will be integrated
[09:06.320 --> 09:11.560]  in to their social network systems it'll be integrated into YouTube and all of
[09:11.560 --> 09:15.960]  it cross referenced popping up tailor-made ads but also telling your
[09:15.960 --> 09:20.320]  friends and family where you've been shopping what you've been doing saying
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.040]  hey Bob went here Bob did this do you think you'll like what Bob's doing
[09:25.040 --> 09:30.000]  that's the incredible creepiness that Facebook's had of course for several
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.360]  years now where when you want to log into your own account they say here's this
[09:34.360 --> 09:40.480]  individual from your high school confirm that this is the person from your
[09:40.480 --> 09:44.280]  high school this happened to Darren McBreen on his Facebook it's happened to
[09:44.280 --> 09:47.600]  us on our official Facebook and you're there you can't even remember you're
[09:47.600 --> 09:52.840]  like yeah I vaguely I vaguely remember that name in that person but I mean
[09:52.840 --> 09:58.960]  they're an adult now I can't really it's wanting you to ping that data so they
[09:58.960 --> 10:04.960]  can have humid or human intelligence with the AI interface to to know if that
[10:04.960 --> 10:09.600]  is indeed someone that you knew in high school and then you think that you're
[10:09.600 --> 10:15.400]  just oh proving to it that you're really logging into your Facebook and they
[10:15.400 --> 10:20.960]  build these big maps with it it is beyond ultra creepy and on the internet
[10:20.960 --> 10:27.040]  takeover front remember the washers the dryers the entertainment centers your
[10:27.040 --> 10:35.360]  television the household appliances especially the refrigerator almost all
[10:35.360 --> 10:41.120]  of the new ones and this is global standardization corporations actually
[10:41.120 --> 10:44.240]  tell the government globally the government's they have big meetings how
[10:44.240 --> 10:48.400]  to standardize what systems to go with and they have debates about it and
[10:48.400 --> 10:53.320]  things and sometimes you'll see something like blu-ray versus HD disc and
[10:53.320 --> 10:56.920]  there'll be a fight between two global companies and then one comes out on top
[10:56.920 --> 11:02.720]  like blu-ray but generally it's globally standardized and backdoors are built in
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.120]  under regulation and in some countries under law where your cell phone tracks
[11:07.120 --> 11:10.840]  you where they can dial in and listen to you even when your phones turned off
[11:10.840 --> 11:16.720]  that was put into regulatory law in 1996 I know I belabor that point it's just
[11:16.720 --> 11:22.760]  this stuff is so standardized take India they just passed a new internet ID law
[11:22.760 --> 11:27.800]  by executive order they couldn't get the parliament to do it but I saw an article
[11:27.800 --> 11:31.360]  over the weekend where the government just signed an executive order where
[11:31.360 --> 11:37.480]  you're going to thumb print and face scan to be able to connect to the internet
[11:37.480 --> 11:41.800]  and then if you if they ever say you've done something wrong no judge no jury
[11:41.800 --> 11:46.200]  under these international treaties you are now just banned you hold your phone
[11:46.200 --> 11:50.240]  up to be able to get your smartphone to be able to get online or your PC or
[11:50.240 --> 11:57.680]  whatever the case is and it says sorry and then somebody else logs on for you
[11:57.680 --> 12:02.880]  they then get banned I mean this is the total control and then everything's
[12:02.880 --> 12:07.200]  going to be on these clouds and so the globalist can put out one directive and
[12:07.200 --> 12:12.520]  this is in all these treaties and every website not authorized to quote have a
[12:12.520 --> 12:20.000]  certain song no judge no jury no nothing the song is erased off of the
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.280]  servers and there's global standardization in the cyber security act
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.440]  there was an article a press release by Homeland Security last Friday we
[12:29.440 --> 12:34.840]  covered put out by them saying Homeland Security at Davos gets agreement
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.920]  from other nations on global standardization of all commerce buying
[12:39.920 --> 12:44.840]  and selling and they're going to tie it to biometrics and once the biometrics
[12:44.840 --> 12:49.520]  are in place where you just walk into the store you'll still swipe the card
[12:49.520 --> 12:56.760]  still give the code but the face scanning camera will authenticate that you're
[12:56.760 --> 13:02.000]  using the card that you're engaged in it now constantly you hear about murders
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.480]  crimes rapes and the police never released the videos or it's never
[13:08.480 --> 13:13.240]  recording at the time and that's all lies the system wants the crime so they
[13:13.240 --> 13:17.800]  only selectively I could take you in the town I live in in Austin to East 11th
[13:17.800 --> 13:23.280]  all these places actually a crack dealers prostitutes no one stops them now
[13:23.280 --> 13:27.720]  if you don't pay your cut to the criminal boss above you who's paying off
[13:27.720 --> 13:33.920]  city officials and government people you'll get shut down but the point is
[13:33.920 --> 13:43.040]  it's all scripted it's all organized crime you know that case of the West
[13:43.040 --> 13:52.080]  point grad I guess he was a was it a captain over in Iraq names a captain
[13:52.080 --> 14:01.400]  honorably discharged and we've had him in studio a few times and it's on the
[14:01.400 --> 14:06.440]  news the police say we're not going to release our dash cam video because of
[14:06.440 --> 14:11.720]  our ongoing investigation this is a guy sees a police officer jumping on and
[14:11.720 --> 14:17.640]  reportedly beating a woman at a 7-11 parking lot he starts taking photos of
[14:17.640 --> 14:23.040]  it get an old phone he's going to get a smartphone a tracker phone and he was
[14:23.040 --> 14:27.880]  taking photos at about 10 feet away 15 feet away he's there at the gas pump this
[14:27.880 --> 14:32.600]  all starts in the gas pump next to him and they pull pull her over they're
[14:32.600 --> 14:36.440]  beating up the woman out of the passenger seat according to his report
[14:36.440 --> 14:39.840]  another witness that has stepped forward so the cops run over he's got his hands
[14:39.840 --> 14:42.840]  up he leans back from the police officer because they don't know somebody
[14:42.840 --> 14:47.320]  was videotaping across the street now the cop had said that he assaulted even
[14:47.320 --> 14:51.480]  stuff but once that video came out they said well he spit on us because they
[14:51.480 --> 14:55.760]  knew the video was shot at about a hundred yards away so you couldn't tell
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.920]  if he was spitting or not so oh he spit on me and now of course there's the cop
[15:00.920 --> 15:07.520]  car pulled up right there the veteran saying release the video and and and
[15:07.520 --> 15:11.720]  our day survey to the police chief says no I'm not going to and it's always the
[15:11.720 --> 15:17.120]  same ladies and gentlemen in Houston they pulled over that former CIA section
[15:17.120 --> 15:22.360]  chief a car to be who was reportedly a whistleblower Wayne Wayne Madsen
[15:22.360 --> 15:25.040]  investigative journalist went down to Houston to investigate it and the guy
[15:25.040 --> 15:28.920]  certainly was CIA on record had all these awards the media spun it and said
[15:28.920 --> 15:33.400]  he's not even CIA but they get him out of the car he doesn't resist he's standing
[15:33.400 --> 15:37.240]  there and the cops execute him and you know what they won't release the squad
[15:37.240 --> 15:44.600]  car videos they got the helicopter shot of him clear his day executing him he was
[15:44.600 --> 15:49.600]  on the run I guess knew something he wasn't supposed to know but they've got
[15:49.600 --> 15:53.720]  especially on big departments like Houston LA was the first to do it on
[15:53.720 --> 16:00.040]  record back in the 60s they have hit teams in every police department actual
[16:00.040 --> 16:04.600]  hit teams and a lot of times it's a quasi mafia but it's government approved
[16:04.600 --> 16:08.560]  and then and when the gangs get out online or somebody doesn't pay them
[16:08.560 --> 16:13.080]  their cut they just send cops to kill you now they're called the Vikings have
[16:13.080 --> 16:18.760]  actually met some of them you know retired detectives in Los Angeles they
[16:18.760 --> 16:24.160]  just can do whatever they want police gangs ladies and gentlemen the Vikings
[16:24.160 --> 16:29.840]  look them up they've been famous incidents of them executing people and
[16:29.840 --> 16:34.360]  doing a lot of things and sometimes there's sub gangs of cops but then they
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.880]  always shut those down so I mean they could they could I don't know if they
[16:39.880 --> 16:42.800]  have hit teams on the Austin Police Department a lot of times they're
[16:42.800 --> 16:46.440]  unsanctioned they're compartmentalized it's it's admitted that all over the
[16:46.440 --> 16:50.000]  country the CIA is now involved with police departments in the threat fusion
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.600]  centers and recruiting but they could just pull me over or I go to the wrong
[16:53.600 --> 16:57.200]  town where they've got their guys they could pull me over shoot me and just say
[16:57.200 --> 17:02.080]  you know what we're not releasing the squad car video national security they
[17:02.080 --> 17:04.400]  could say whatever they want they could have me get on my knees shoot me right
[17:04.400 --> 17:08.400]  in the back of the head they could do it to you they did it to carnaby get out
[17:08.400 --> 17:13.680]  of the car he gets out boom you're dead oops helicopter caught that went out
[17:13.680 --> 17:21.720]  live doesn't matter you want close-up video we're not gonna release that you
[17:21.720 --> 17:25.080]  know I love how they always talk about the veterans the system does about how
[17:25.080 --> 17:30.120]  much they love them how much they care about them how great they are but I've
[17:30.120 --> 17:39.800]  got an article here police get help with confronting veterans officer calm and
[17:39.800 --> 17:47.560]  yeah they're training for their number one enemy returning military oh cuz
[17:47.560 --> 17:54.240]  these are people you just can't bully all day that'll actually break and respond
[17:54.240 --> 17:57.840]  and the article actually says that more and more the number one thing killing
[17:57.840 --> 18:02.000]  SWAT team members and others is trained military people yeah they've actually
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.640]  been actually fighting men and people that are shooting back at them in some
[18:05.640 --> 18:09.760]  cases it's not just rating drug dealers that didn't pay their cut to you or
[18:09.760 --> 18:14.240]  whatever and their people that have already killed so many people and feel
[18:14.240 --> 18:18.560]  bad about it that they're ready to die and so they're ready to sell their life
[18:18.560 --> 18:23.080]  for a bunch of you guys what do you think's gonna happen as they try the gun
[18:23.080 --> 18:27.240]  confiscation they're training the military and police for what is gonna
[18:27.240 --> 18:34.760]  happen when 1% of the 10 million plus veterans fight back against you total
[18:34.760 --> 18:39.880]  devastation there's nothing you can do nothing the system can do no amount of
[18:39.880 --> 18:45.520]  robots drones nothing will help you and of course the globalist have all this
[18:45.520 --> 18:50.640]  set up by design they think they're gonna have some cutesy civil war and out of
[18:50.640 --> 18:54.120]  this problem reaction solution everything will break down then later
[18:54.120 --> 19:02.560]  will beg for total tyranny I don't see that happening and what's really creepy
[19:02.560 --> 19:07.720]  is in every place in the United States every major sitting that we've spot
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.440]  checked their training for at least five years the explorer scouts we first
[19:12.440 --> 19:15.000]  learned about this from listeners and it was the New York Times or their
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.280]  publications they're training 14 and 15 year old boys to take on quote
[19:19.280 --> 19:25.840]  disgruntled veterans and kill them people have all got some 14 year olds the
[19:25.840 --> 19:33.160]  first 14 year olds to be trained are now 19 the point is there the criminals

[24:08.520 --> 24:16.880]  Aaron Dykes one of our investigative reporters here and a frequent host of
[24:16.880 --> 24:20.120]  info works nightly news ran in there in the break and he said you know how
[24:20.120 --> 24:25.360]  you're talking about how the government runs organized crime well yeah it's on
[24:25.360 --> 24:30.640]  record in so many testimonies and Congress history he said don't forget
[24:30.640 --> 24:38.400]  Zbigniew Brzezinski top globalist think tank leader his book between two ages I
[24:38.400 --> 24:44.360]  remember this being on the bookshelf at my parents house this this book with this
[24:44.360 --> 24:48.040]  cover I didn't read it when I was a kid I remember that cover between two ages
[24:48.040 --> 24:53.080]  America's role in the technotronic era you notice the globalists call
[24:53.080 --> 24:58.360]  themselves technocrats okay they've planned all of this they've designed the
[24:58.360 --> 25:03.220]  technology with Trojan horses to control you think the technology has the
[25:03.220 --> 25:08.200]  use that you're using it for that's only the the bait on the hook to get you to
[25:08.200 --> 25:12.200]  use Google to get you to use the cell phone it's designed as a tracking and
[25:12.200 --> 25:16.520]  taxing grid listen to what Brzezinski says this is a guy who also wrote a book
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.960]  two years ago bragging that they created Al Qaeda and that they the US
[25:21.960 --> 25:27.240]  government funded pole pot oh just type in Zbigniew Brzezinski pole pot quotes
[25:27.240 --> 25:31.920]  and he's very proud that he helped finance them and they killed 30% of
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.080]  their population that's why he's respected by globalists they they the
[25:37.080 --> 25:42.600]  actual owners have all at their master generals their technotronic technocratic
[25:42.600 --> 25:50.440]  generals and Zbigniew Brzezinski is one so is Henry Kissinger this is on page
[25:50.440 --> 25:58.680]  six a characteristic feature of concentrated humanity is the
[25:58.680 --> 26:03.760]  routinization of conflict direct violence becomes increasingly regulated
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.920]  and restricted and ultimately comes to be considered as a deviation from the
[26:08.920 --> 26:13.560]  norm organized mechanisms in the form of uniformed salaried personnel are
[26:13.560 --> 26:18.120]  established to confine violence to socially tolerable limits a certain
[26:18.120 --> 26:21.840]  measure of crime is accepted as unavoidable for the sake of order
[26:21.840 --> 26:27.720]  therefore organized crime is generally preferred to an arctic violence thus
[26:27.720 --> 26:35.880]  indirectly and informally becoming an extension of order very our page six in
[26:35.880 --> 26:39.600]  fact zoom in on that with a document cam shot for folks that are watching on
[26:39.600 --> 26:48.440]  prisonplanet.tv so you need to understand remember some documents we've
[26:48.440 --> 26:52.360]  covered came out what the 70s in Chicago that what we already knew it was
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.240]  going on that the police departments were regulating the crime and certifying
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.920]  different organized crime syndicates well I mean that's already known
[27:01.920 --> 27:11.120]  remember what happened and there's so many examples of this but but remember
[27:11.120 --> 27:16.520]  Jagger Hoover in the early 1950s and testimony to Congress saying there's no
[27:16.520 --> 27:22.400]  such thing as organized crime that it is a figment of crime reporters
[27:22.400 --> 27:29.000]  imagination basically they were conspiracy theorist now now now why was
[27:29.000 --> 27:39.160]  that because Jagger Hoover on record lived a lifestyle of an incredibly rich
[27:39.160 --> 27:46.440]  person Jagger Hoover was being paid off Jagger Hoover was incredibly corrupt the
[27:46.440 --> 27:55.440]  G men were only there to shut down small syndicates that were involved in
[27:55.440 --> 28:00.040]  prohibition running liquor that weren't paying their cut and if you've got a
[28:00.040 --> 28:05.440]  hot springs Arkansas which became the main hub of creating Everclear or
[28:05.440 --> 28:09.080]  moonshine to be shipped all over the United States at their little museums
[28:09.080 --> 28:14.680]  there in the city the tour guides on record and and the books that they sell
[28:14.680 --> 28:18.920]  for the little historical society it's all the Rockefellers were there the
[28:18.920 --> 28:25.560]  Capones all of them and the elite would all come there to get treated for
[28:25.560 --> 28:30.280]  syphilis and other things that they had from all their sexual activity but that
[28:30.280 --> 28:34.520]  they would produce the liquor there and then ship it by train all over the
[28:34.520 --> 28:42.000]  United States and that the US government was involved but of course Jagger
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.160]  Hoover in the 1950s could sit there and tell the childlike public there is no
[28:48.160 --> 28:51.520]  such thing as organized crime now you hear that today and you're like well
[28:51.520 --> 28:57.240]  that's ridiculous everybody knows there's organized crime really Hollywood
[28:57.240 --> 29:02.440]  teaches you that it's only the Italians or the Mexican mafia or you know some
[29:02.440 --> 29:10.480]  Russian mob oh really the Russian mafia is the NKVD that the whole GRU KGB
[29:10.480 --> 29:16.560]  apparatus that never went away FSB you can go look up the connections to that
[29:16.560 --> 29:23.080]  organized crime is only the black arm the black op arm of government government
[29:23.080 --> 29:28.920]  itself a black op arm of the megabanks so the child kidnapping rings the drug
[29:28.920 --> 29:35.280]  dealing all of it all of it is banker run our countries everything grow up
[29:35.280 --> 29:39.320]  folks when the troops got mad about being told to grow the opium the
[29:39.320 --> 29:42.680]  government just went public that they're growing the opium that means that's how
[29:42.680 --> 29:46.200]  dumb they think you are when a cop pulls you over wants to search your car for
[29:46.200 --> 29:51.240]  drugs you know as full well as bosses ship it all in we're on the March the

[33:45.040 --> 33:47.680]  try to be a little more disciplined let me attempt because I've only probably
[33:47.680 --> 33:51.240]  got 200 articles here in front of me every one of them I could spend three
[33:51.240 --> 34:05.880]  hours on here's CBS news out of Hercules where is Hercules it says the
[34:05.880 --> 34:10.920]  Lupine Hills Elementary School in Hercules I think I had this last night
[34:10.920 --> 34:15.000]  and didn't cover it because I meant to go do a search and find out where Hercules
[34:15.000 --> 34:22.560]  is first I guess it's outside San Francisco that's what it looks like yeah
[34:22.560 --> 34:27.760]  it is a East Bay dad claims a game of tag on the playground resulted in his
[34:27.760 --> 34:33.480]  six-year-old son being accused of sexual assault and they school it goes on
[34:33.480 --> 34:38.880]  says that touching someone on the leg is sexual assault and he's now going to be
[34:38.880 --> 34:44.160]  listed as basically a sexual offender and has been put in a database yeah I see
[34:44.160 --> 34:49.640]  this all the time in the news and they've got a local magazine called Busted
[34:49.640 --> 34:54.120]  a weekly newspaper that comes out and I sometimes I'll buy it and look through it
[34:54.120 --> 34:59.920]  mainly it's DWI sometimes you see you know urinating and public sexual indecency
[34:59.920 --> 35:06.760]  and I see the reports where people pull off on the highway now in the middle of
[35:06.760 --> 35:12.720]  nowhere like we all did growing up and you go in the bushes and the cops pull
[35:12.720 --> 35:15.800]  up and run over and say what were you doing and if you're honest they go over
[35:15.800 --> 35:19.800]  and get samples and everything put you in handcuffs and take you to jail because
[35:19.800 --> 35:26.600]  they've been ordered to and when I was up at Bilderberg 2006 in Ottawa Canada on
[35:26.600 --> 35:32.680]  the suburb of it the hotel was built out in a kind of defense contractor
[35:32.680 --> 35:39.080]  complex with like lakes and ponds and geese everywhere it was well I was like
[35:39.080 --> 35:43.440]  20 miles outside Ottawa or 15 miles outside so it was big hotels and golf
[35:43.440 --> 35:49.440]  courses built in the countryside and all there was was this hotel and then you
[35:49.440 --> 35:52.800]  know a half mile away a defense contractor building with bar bar fences
[35:52.800 --> 35:57.320]  so there was nowhere to go to the bathroom and the cops were all ordered
[35:57.320 --> 36:02.800]  sometimes more than 20 of them so about 10 squad cars any one time to be parked
[36:02.800 --> 36:06.840]  all around there and I guess they didn't want to go through all the security
[36:06.840 --> 36:15.120]  procedures to go in to the Brooksfield Hotel to urinate so they would all just
[36:15.120 --> 36:22.960]  go across the street to a field in woods and urinate and of course the
[36:22.960 --> 36:26.160]  protesters over the three days were doing the same thing so I'd talk to the
[36:26.160 --> 36:32.120]  police most of them are really really nice and I was like you know in the US
[36:32.120 --> 36:36.240]  they arrest us and he goes arrest you for going to the bathroom in the woods
[36:36.240 --> 36:40.760]  and he goes yeah I've heard that I go but I see you guys going over there and
[36:40.760 --> 36:43.560]  he goes well what are we supposed to do I go exactly so are you gonna arrest us
[36:43.560 --> 36:48.760]  for going over there and he goes no that's ridiculous see I mean in America
[36:48.760 --> 36:56.240]  is so sick I mean I hear about all the time I know business people and others
[36:56.240 --> 37:03.960]  who've been in national forest urinating up against a tree and the
[37:03.960 --> 37:09.280]  ranger comes over and handcuffs them I mean we're being turned into totally
[37:09.280 --> 37:15.000]  domesticated creatures that live in a false environment I said I discipline
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.120]  myself and cover 200 articles of course you know it's not gonna happen here is
[37:19.120 --> 37:28.240]  this CBS news out of Hercules a suburb of San Francisco and going back over a
[37:28.240 --> 37:35.360]  decade ago they first banned dodgeball everybody's favorite game then they
[37:35.360 --> 37:40.840]  banned tag and they banned wrestling and they then they banned touching guys
[37:40.840 --> 37:47.960]  people won't believe this search running at recess banned I mean there'll be
[37:47.960 --> 37:53.200]  hundreds of articles that's been and and running is now could be dangerous you
[37:53.200 --> 38:01.380]  could fall down you could skin your knee and so they're banning running and they
[38:01.380 --> 38:06.240]  were playing tag and this child reportedly touched the other on the leg
[38:06.240 --> 38:12.520]  tackling them I mean what now if a coach slaps you on the back or the good
[38:12.520 --> 38:19.280]  job you know up sexual assault taken to jail meanwhile Dinecore and Halliburton
[38:19.280 --> 38:24.800]  are in the Chicago Tribune Associated Press this is five years ago but hundreds
[38:24.800 --> 38:29.880]  of articles you can pull up where they're on record with C-130s and women and
[38:29.880 --> 38:33.560]  children they've grabbed at gunpoint loading them up and the UN does it
[38:33.560 --> 38:39.640]  flying them to Thailand Saudi Arabia Israel where their actual sex slaves and
[38:39.640 --> 38:45.480]  sometimes they snuff film them this came out on Italian TV they actually this
[38:45.480 --> 38:49.920]  was Russian-connected gangsters that were doing that blowing the children's
[38:49.920 --> 38:56.640]  heads off and they were selling the videos to Hollywood rich people it came
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.000]  out in a few articles in the US they were selling the videos for as much they
[39:01.000 --> 39:07.800]  reported for $50,000 per VHS this is like five six years ago VHS tapes of I'm
[39:07.800 --> 39:10.840]  not going to even say what the Italian news the Italian news blurted and
[39:10.840 --> 39:15.840]  blighted on national TV and actually got fired for it but it was two-year-olds
[39:15.840 --> 39:20.320]  being raped them and being and then having their heads blown off with
[39:20.320 --> 39:27.040]  the revolvers this is the type of stuff so so again in this criminal yeah
[39:27.040 --> 39:30.880]  there's town hall running at recess banned
[39:32.680 --> 39:40.200]  they banned running at recess and the police arrest you there you go town hall
[39:40.200 --> 39:47.480]  George will the police arrest you so the police arrest you for running or for
[39:47.480 --> 39:57.800]  playing tag arrest you but the fortune 100 defense contractors the UN just type
[39:57.800 --> 40:02.440]  in UN's sexual abuse UN raping children I mean it's every day it's in the news
[40:02.440 --> 40:09.920]  these are brigades of pedophile sickos who love getting paid near minimum
[40:09.920 --> 40:13.840]  wage and stomping around in the worst cess pits in the world because they can
[40:13.840 --> 40:18.880]  kill and murder whoever they want it is hunting raping killing slaughtering
[40:18.880 --> 40:24.120]  raping women full-grown men children you can type into the search engine UN
[40:24.120 --> 40:30.760]  troops barbecuing children UN troops raping I mean it's all there newspaper
[40:30.760 --> 40:37.600]  articles all of it I mean just it is a hell force UN troops in South Sudan
[40:37.600 --> 40:43.680]  raping children daily Telegraph that was from when
[40:45.280 --> 40:51.120]  yeah that's 2007 but but again I mean it's just unlimited that's just the
[40:51.120 --> 41:00.760]  first thing they pulled up so so this is how the criminals operate the OPM is
[41:00.760 --> 41:04.760]  publicly grown by our troops and loaded on C-130s and shipped into Europe and the
[41:04.760 --> 41:08.840]  United States Pat Tillman wrote letters home saying he was gonna come back and
[41:08.840 --> 41:13.280]  talk about it so they just murdered him you're talking about 500 bill just an
[41:13.280 --> 41:16.680]  opium out of there another 500 bills same number in total drugs brought into
[41:16.680 --> 41:23.120]  the US every year there's BBC peacekeepers abusing children they're
[41:23.120 --> 41:28.760]  loading them on C-130s the highest dollar ones are southern and eastern and
[41:28.760 --> 41:35.240]  western European children they and they're engaged in every evil under the
[41:35.240 --> 41:39.480]  Sun publicly but all these Hollywood people who are concerned about sex
[41:39.480 --> 41:43.160]  trafficking but you know that's the big trendy thing now the system always takes
[41:43.160 --> 41:48.240]  over the fight against breast cancer the fight against children being kidnapped
[41:48.240 --> 41:52.440]  the fight against any abuse that's going on so they can control the debate and
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.000]  control the advocacy and then collect money from the public that they actually
[41:57.000 --> 42:03.640]  use to shut down cowboy grassroots traffickers in drugs in organs in diamonds
[42:03.640 --> 42:09.160]  in children these are models that are used and they have movies against the
[42:09.160 --> 42:15.280]  blood diamonds which is really now there it is aid workers raping children
[42:15.280 --> 42:23.000]  major charities running child kidnapping rings that's good guys I mean people can
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.960]  go find it for themselves because every time they put the articles on screen I
[42:25.960 --> 42:30.920]  kind of turn and start reading them on air it's an unlimited bottomless black
[42:30.920 --> 42:37.440]  pit directly into the vortex of hell with unlimited criminal government
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.880]  rendition flights torture torturing children why do you think at every one
[42:41.880 --> 42:47.080]  of the torture bases in Iraq the army's own reports just type in army report on
[42:47.080 --> 42:51.840]  torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib and you will get the big PDF read the hundreds
[42:51.840 --> 42:59.080]  of pages the the the phosphoric acid on the children the all of it I mean this
[42:59.080 --> 43:10.560]  is this is dungeon keeper Jeffrey Dahmer beyond anything you can imagine and
[43:10.560 --> 43:13.880]  and why do you think it goes on everywhere because it's what they like to
[43:13.880 --> 43:22.240]  do and they sell you on torture like it's a good thing to get the bad guys to
[43:22.240 --> 43:28.000]  keep you safe when in truth this is a society of psychos and pit demons who
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.680]  want to openly do what they do safely because they want the big bonanza
[43:32.680 --> 43:37.680]  America and Europe Canada Australia New Zealand they want to do here what they've
[43:37.680 --> 43:49.320]  done all over the world now the South works they publicly in the 80s and 90s
[43:49.320 --> 43:52.360]  got caught shipping cocaine in and still run it all in and still constantly get
[43:52.360 --> 43:55.280]  caught nobody gets in trouble the government does and select corporations
[43:55.280 --> 43:59.120]  the banks that launder it they're bringing in the opium all of it and when
[43:59.120 --> 44:04.440]  they get caught their new thing I know I marvel every day about this is to think
[44:04.440 --> 44:12.480]  about this have Fox CNN MSNBC BBC ABC news all make excuses that the troops
[44:12.480 --> 44:16.520]  help grow the opium because if they don't the Al Qaeda will and they'll get the
[44:16.520 --> 44:22.320]  money that's what Brazinski says in his book between two ages written back in
[44:22.320 --> 44:25.320]  the 70s let me give you the actual publishing date I'm going from memory
[44:25.320 --> 44:31.760]  that was written in the 70s I did read this when I was in college yeah 1970 he
[44:31.760 --> 44:35.600]  says the governments of the world control organized crime because that makes
[44:35.600 --> 44:41.360]  it manageable that's how they sell the excuse makes it manageable grabbing
[44:41.360 --> 44:46.160]  kids off playgrounds and putting them on C-130s to take them so Saudi Arabia and
[44:46.160 --> 44:51.240]  royalty can rape them and blow their heads off they feel like it no the
[44:51.240 --> 44:58.040]  government has raced to the bottom and is purely satanic and demonic and filthy
[44:58.040 --> 45:04.600]  serial killing murdering demons none of us are safe hell has been released okay
[45:04.600 --> 45:12.680]  it's already going on the the new world order isn't coming it's already here
[45:12.680 --> 45:17.480]  everybody gets upset when the troops shoot dogs or blow people's sheep up in
[45:17.480 --> 45:21.960]  Afghanistan or Iraq for fun or torture a puppy on video because we haven't been
[45:21.960 --> 45:28.440]  taught haven't seen simulated murders of dogs millions of times on TV we've seen
[45:28.440 --> 45:32.400]  simulated murders of humans where we see it as entertainment now we've lost our
[45:32.400 --> 45:37.280]  humanity but through animals and all these groups wanting to protect animals
[45:37.280 --> 45:42.080]  which I think is fine we can find our humanity what about children what about
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.600]  a three-year-old a five-year-old grabbed out of their backyard grabbed out of the
[45:46.600 --> 45:50.320]  public school or a lot of times they have CPS come in and shop for the kids
[45:50.320 --> 45:54.760]  they want and the kid just disappears remember six seven years ago CNN was
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.800]  reporting thousands of children missing the CPS had taken they were finding
[45:58.800 --> 46:02.800]  them buried and dead and in foreign countries and then that politically went
[46:02.800 --> 46:07.080]  to the top of the CPS where the entire leadership were convicted pedophiles and
[46:07.080 --> 46:15.280]  then the story stopped right there it stopped because it went too high see
[46:15.280 --> 46:18.560]  there's not complete control the media yet there's still reporters that want to
[46:18.560 --> 46:24.080]  get the truth out but when they find out just how bad it is when it when it
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.480]  breaks through to the other side that's why I say I've seen reality I've really
[46:28.480 --> 46:35.560]  studied what's going on and it's so totally hellish all you can do is
[46:35.560 --> 46:40.320]  resist it there is not a discussion about backing off a lot of people hear me
[46:40.320 --> 46:43.600]  talk about these hard things and they say well we better shut up we better go
[46:43.600 --> 46:48.800]  along with this these people sound really evil don't you get it folks that's how
[46:48.800 --> 46:54.120]  they win that's why they've been winning because what they do is so horrible
[46:54.120 --> 46:58.560]  people are intimidated people can't believe the scope of it you come face to
[46:58.560 --> 47:05.400]  face with something so horrible so totally evil that you can't believe it
[47:05.400 --> 47:10.920]  how many times in criminology have you read where the neighbor seems so nice so
[47:10.920 --> 47:14.760]  friendly drives a nice car business suit and they dig up 30 bodies in the
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.720]  backyard and then there's videos you know in photos the person has of them
[47:18.720 --> 47:22.160]  torturing people and the neighbors are like I had coffee with him he took care
[47:22.160 --> 47:27.840]  of my son he watered our plants I knew him for 20 years I can't believe it you
[47:27.840 --> 47:36.000]  better believe it you better believe it real good because I'm gonna say it again
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.920]  and finally it's starting to get into the news and I want to think that we're
[47:38.920 --> 47:41.560]  actually getting some of this going here's the one that independent
[47:41.560 --> 47:47.040]  research into mutant flu must go on scientists dismiss US groups fear of
[47:47.040 --> 47:51.920]  the creation of airborne H5N1 virus could inspire bioterrorism as if it's
[47:51.920 --> 47:58.040]  going to inspire it they've made it they've made mouse pox obola airborne
[47:58.040 --> 48:04.520]  that kills in every case depending on what pathogen 91 92 93 94 some of these
[48:04.520 --> 48:12.440]  killed 99% of the target mammalian species they're made for I know I keep
[48:12.440 --> 48:17.040]  harping on this I mean the police are arresting people that run at recess all
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.040]  over the United States you see you think I exaggerate I said pull up articles
[48:21.040 --> 48:24.400]  about them banning running they pull up bunch of articles where they're
[48:24.400 --> 48:30.360]  arresting five-year-olds for running where they're arresting seven-year-olds
[48:30.360 --> 48:35.520]  for tag where this is going on meanwhile they're grabbing children
[48:35.520 --> 48:39.600]  worldwide raping them and then chopping their heads off blowing their heads off
[48:39.600 --> 48:47.760]  on video and I'll never forget I walked out of pf chains about three four years
[48:47.760 --> 48:51.080]  ago and there were a whole bunch of cops that have been in their eating in
[48:51.080 --> 48:55.560]  uniform they were all laughing and stuff and I said hey are you guys doing they

[50:07.560 --> 50:13.280]  are afraid of them and scurry and fear from them said something to them I wanted
[50:13.280 --> 50:17.000]  to see what they'd say you know what they looked at me and and and a couple
[50:17.000 --> 50:21.520]  of them acted thrilled and empowered and said yeah we work for them and it

[54:47.720 --> 54:53.760]  saying should we be shooting ourselves in the head no but it's all about
[54:53.760 --> 54:57.240]  control mechanisms about making the general public criminals that's why I
[54:57.240 --> 55:02.000]  get so mad when a cop pulls me over and starts asking me what's in my car and
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.280]  asking me if I have drugs I'm like are you kidding even if I did which I don't
[55:07.280 --> 55:15.160]  anymore on knows the drugs are shipped in by the government and then you want to
[55:15.160 --> 55:22.840]  bust me with some to put me in prison I mean I don't even eat your MSG by the
[55:22.840 --> 55:27.240]  way you know the type of drugs they put in our food if you read those additives
[55:27.240 --> 55:32.200]  every one of those pharmacological additives is just a drug that they got
[55:32.200 --> 55:37.480]  added as a food additive here's New Yorker magazine the caging of America
[55:37.480 --> 55:42.400]  why do we lock up so many people and it goes on report there's now six million
[55:42.400 --> 55:46.640]  people six million people are under correctional supervision the US more
[55:46.640 --> 55:51.280]  than were in Stalin's gulags yeah no one has ever done by the way all over the
[55:51.280 --> 55:56.400]  world prison populations are skyrocketing you know you can't tell me the
[55:56.400 --> 55:59.600]  federal courts are real when they've been caught in all their fraud and they
[55:59.600 --> 56:06.320]  convict 98% you think 98% are guilty only have that kind of conviction rate in
[56:06.320 --> 56:10.720]  North Korea and here you can't tell me six million people in prison and by the
[56:10.720 --> 56:16.840]  way they're colleges of crime you take somebody and for a nonviolent offense you
[56:16.840 --> 56:20.360]  put them in jail ruin their future of having a career they're going to get out
[56:20.360 --> 56:24.400]  only knowing criminals and they're going to become criminals which is what the
[56:24.400 --> 56:29.400]  system wants they want to irrevocably destroy people's lives this is a
[56:29.400 --> 56:35.280]  scorched earth new world order takeover system period I want to get your take on
[56:35.280 --> 56:42.160]  this and more 800-259-9231 I got all the latest on Newt Gennrich and Mitt Romney
[56:42.160 --> 56:48.440]  I'll get to it after some calls you know even rhinos cannot support newt
[56:48.440 --> 56:51.480]  Gennrich and I'm not saying that makes Mitt Romney good it's just Gennrich if
[56:51.480 --> 56:56.480]  it's possible is even worse and now newt goes nuclear Gennrich slams pro
[56:56.480 --> 57:03.320]  abortion pro gun control pro tax increase moderate Mitt Romney well I mean
[57:03.320 --> 57:07.000]  that's basically what newt's been in the past but flip-flopped I mean yeah I
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.120]  mean it's too globalist fighting with each other as if we've got to choose one
[57:11.120 --> 57:14.760]  of them meanwhile Ron Paul is right in there with him but the media never gives
[57:14.760 --> 57:18.200]  Ron Paul attention they act like they're always asking when are you going to drop
[57:18.200 --> 57:21.160]  out but the key is more dirt's coming out on Gennrich more is coming out on
[57:21.160 --> 57:25.520]  Romney and as they destroy each other Ron Paul moves up now there's election
[57:25.520 --> 57:28.360]  fraud involved but we know we're not going to win if we don't come to the
[57:28.360 --> 57:31.880]  table and fight we want to be able to expose the fraud if we don't fight at
[57:31.880 --> 57:37.920]  least Ron Paul's in there injecting real issues also coming up I've been
[57:37.920 --> 57:41.160]  telling you this forever because it was in a British Ministry of Defense report
[57:41.160 --> 57:47.200]  2007 but now they're telling the general public UK riots pair troopers are
[57:47.200 --> 57:51.080]  trained in riot control British troops are being trained in riot control
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.520]  activities and fears that violence and looting will return to Britain's streets
[57:55.520 --> 58:01.280]  now in the United States the Army times and all the other big publications
[58:01.280 --> 58:06.960]  are all stars and stripes you name it reporting that they're preparing for
[58:06.960 --> 58:11.600]  martial law but then the national news attacks myself and Ron Paul for warning
[58:11.600 --> 58:15.280]  of this just because we actually read the Army times it's like oh look they say
[58:15.280 --> 58:19.040]  they're gonna do this oh you're crazy because they're not ready for you to
[58:19.040 --> 58:23.280]  know about this yet so they communicate with each other but then when
[58:23.280 --> 58:28.120]  someone actually reads it oh you know that's a conspiracy theory and Kurt

[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.160]  against the transhumanist eugenics death cult known as the new world order you
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:51.160]  are illegitimate criminal degenerate scum you are lawless trash and you are
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:56.960]  not my rulers I am a sovereign American and people are sovereign worldwide as
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.120]  human beings I'm not only a sovereign American because America is only based on
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.600]  the fact that the individual is sovereign endowed by their creator with
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:16.000]  unalienable rights you can pass laws all day saying I'm your slave I'm not scum and
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.880]  if you notice that as we lose our liberties and as our freedoms are
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.200]  flushed down the toilet as the oxygen leaves the room the prosperity leaves as
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:30.280]  well that that's the thing you want freedom anytime a system a corporate
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:34.120]  system a government system tries to get rid of basic freedoms basic checks and
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:41.480]  balances look out look out and boy is it look out time you think stops bad now
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:49.440]  this is an engineered depression I'm gonna go to Jim Wilson Angie and others
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:59.000]  the toll-free number to join us on air is 800 259 9231 and I want your view on
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.280]  the news on Ron Paul on military in Europe the US England openly trying to
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.480]  take on the people now they've gone from denying it to admitting it
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.960]  signal secretly arrest us tasering and attacking peaceful demonstrators all
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.720]  over the country those videos are pouring in an incredible piece of
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.920]  legislation out of New Jersey and they've got similar ones in California in
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:28.520]  other areas New Jersey bill aims to ban all handgun ammo some rifle ammo if you
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:33.400]  think I'm joking we have links to the NRA and ammo land on this and we've read
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.480]  the bill it also bans any alteration on a gun you add some kind of sites you do
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:43.240]  something it's it's called defacing it's illegal in an in-run around an all-out
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:48.480]  gun ban the New Jersey assembly of law and public safety committee is set to
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.280]  consider legislation that would ban ammunition under the auspices of
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:56.280]  protecting police and you gotta love this idea that the police if anything
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:00.360]  could well cars could kill a cop better ban those that you know the police on
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.360]  record said they don't have to protect us it's not their job to they're really
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:08.840]  there to enforce revenue collection but then and they do protect it takes 10
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:14.080]  15 minutes to get there when they do do their job or allowed to but you shouldn't
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:21.800]  be able to have a gun like Chicago or New York or England but then all they but
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:26.800]  then they have guns to protect themselves the language seemingly targets
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.000]  the already prohibited armor-piercing ammunition but would encompass any ammo
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.400]  that is deemed to quote pose a threat to the safety and well-being of law
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:40.240]  enforcement and the well-being ammo land is a reporting that the common hunting
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.280]  target self-defense ammunition would be subject to ban along with BBs air gun
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.560]  pellets and non-metallic ammunition like plastic airsoft pellets the NRA
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.520]  concurs and it goes through the whole deal we have a link to the bill here's
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:59.400]  another little little little juicy that just went up at info wars.com and then
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.360]  I'm going to your phone calls
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:15.920]  okay continuing here indie Super Bowl national security state protects sports
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:23.920]  fans from prostitutes you you you just heard me right remember Aaron Dyches
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:28.160]  article last week off homeland security press releases where they said we are
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.480]  going to federalize your police we're going to hire your police we're going to
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.360]  have checkpoints mobile trucks body scanners house scanners they're already
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.600]  on the streets in many areas we're going to finance you know all these new face
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:44.200]  scanning cameras license plate readers we're taking over but not to even fight
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.840]  foreign terrorism no it's the new thing is domestic groups anti-government groups
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:56.680]  and crime and Kurt Nemo has links here to the government's own press releases
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:02.160]  that all criminal activity including pickpocketing and prostitution homeland
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:09.880]  security federal police and TSA are going to be there fighting crime no more
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.400]  jurisdiction always inserting themselves in any big event I mean the last few
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.000]  years they've had big sys up on telescreens telling the people there to
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.080]  watch each other I mean just a totally paranoid whacked out sick culture
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.320]  meanwhile Al Qaeda publicly works for the banks that run the US that they've
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.920]  given Al Qaeda Libya they're giving them Syria they're giving them everything
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.240]  Indianapolis local cops and FBI have set up a massive surveillance grid ahead of
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:40.240]  the Super Bowl and they have behavioral scanning cameras on February 5th the
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.560]  heightened security including a smartphone photo and video surveillance
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.960]  network the installation of 150 new manhole covers like terrace of the
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.520]  bomb zone and virtual lockdown of a 44 block area is not responsible attack
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:00.280]  Al Qaeda but we use to quote direct signs of pickpocketing prostitution and
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:05.720]  other trouble according to the Department of Homeland Security the
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:12.120]  Super Bowl rates as a national security event or in SSE that may be a target of
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.040]  potential terrorism and other criminal activity possibly of the sort mentioned
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:23.040]  above and it just goes on to talk about FEMA and and all the grips that are
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.120]  going to be there and of course now TSA has standardized groping of everyone
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.440]  think I'll have Kurt add that to his article that they always they run the
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.560]  training in the groping okay let's go to your calls Jim Wilson Angie and others
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:43.880]  Jim in Texas you're on the air hey buddy well it's been a couple years that I
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:48.920]  talked to you man and like most callers I have to say kudos to you man you've been
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.400]  right on the bad about the things you predicted they don't always happen in
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.720]  the exact time frame that you think they might but usually you're pretty damn
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:03.840]  long on the home schedule man anyway as far as the wrong thing goes how do we
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.000]  know what's true every person I've talked to in the country and I talked to
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.760]  people randomly that they'll need to know every one of them say the vote wrong
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:17.560]  Paul so well I know this I was in the central counting area in the Republican
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:25.800]  primary in 1995 for the or was it 1996 for the 1996 presidential election I
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:31.200]  was in the central tabulation area and talked to everybody and it was stacking
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:37.280]  ballots coming in for Travis County and Pat Buchanan had well over half and I
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:40.440]  think you got like two percent in the counting when it was all counted because
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.780]  you would stick the scantron ballots in a computer now later we found out there
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:48.920]  was fraud countywide of course I mean this is an organized crime syndicate to
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:54.120]  rob everybody but that's how they get away with eighty percent power price
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.800]  increases in a year and say it's for the earth what's really for the groups
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:03.600]  robbing us all over the nation we're seeing election fraud South Carolina
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:09.560]  Iowa New Hampshire though he still came in second place there and it
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.960]  undoubtedly Ron Paul is really the front runner you've seen him cheat him on
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.440]  time you've seen him cheat him on coverage when they do cover him it's
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.600]  negative you've seen all the polls where media is cheated where he's in first or
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:25.440]  second place they just don't even mention that the poll results so yes but
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:29.440]  but see Ron Paul understands if he just says oh it's all a fraud that will
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:36.320]  derail momentum and that won't cause a huge grassroots awakening and then and
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.240]  then he'll fall behind it won't even be in the you know of the debates or stay
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.800]  in these primaries to educate people and to build campaign for liberty but
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.440]  yes there is strategic vote fraud all over the country it's undoubtedly being
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:55.080]  used against Ron Paul with a lot of other attacks and he just can't look like a
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.040]  sore loser because still a lot of the public are childlike I mean the
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.600]  government took everybody's blood for 40 years secretly at birth the government
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.160]  shot up people with syphilis the government radiates foster kids to death
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.600]  and I don't mean in the 50s yet happen then to New York Daily News they grab
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.200]  the kids and test pesticides on them till they die look it up folks the people
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:18.880]  running things are a guild of psycho criminals who have gotten away with
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.840]  everything so why shouldn't they get away with more they've had die-bold
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:26.640]  officials go public they've had people be killed who've gone public we've
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:33.120]  certified fraud in in Ohio the 2004 election yes it's going on it's look
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:38.440]  of course a bunch of crooks came in to control this country's 15 trillion
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:42.360]  dollar a year economy when you get rid of checks and balances and don't have
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.080]  paper ballots and it's designed for fraud you're going to be robbed period
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:52.400]  Jim absolutely man I agree with you 100% Alex and I know everybody I've
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.080]  spoken to like I said I speak to people at random I'm not afraid to just you
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.360]  know strike up a conversation with somebody and see where their minds at
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.720]  unfortunately most of them's minds are what what you describe as within the
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:08.760]  Overture window I rarely ever meet an individual that's able to have free
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:14.680]  thought that's it's a rare anymore well yeah people value having a restricted
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:18.840]  and and and childlike mind they think that protects them because they think
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.240]  that makes reality it's just because you dress up in a Batman outfit doesn't
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.120]  make you Batman folks just because you imagine oh that's extreme cuz lying
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.840]  talking heads who practice looking official told you so but yes there is
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:38.400]  incredible systemic election fraud that's why they don't care there's a nine
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.800]  percent approval rating for Congress the government is telling us they're
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.800]  allowed to insider trade and that it's legal when it's illegal they're openly
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.760]  massing military force against us but you know the good news what we're the
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:59.160]  voting that they can't cover up is donations Ron Paul 74% last number I
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.040]  saw of all military donations for the Democrat candidate Obama and all the
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.000]  Republicans are go to Ron Paul so again and people say well then why are you
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.720]  saying the military's praying for war they're they're creating the cadres over
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:18.040]  the last decade shifting out who wants to shoot Americans who is a psycho or who
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.720]  is so stupid they'll follow orders and they've built this army of darkness the
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:26.040]  rest of the troops who know what's going on that's why the government's
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.440]  now telling cops they're the enemy get ready for war with the vets you
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:36.000]  understand that we've actually got the vets so so but but again we don't want

[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:46.160]  bunch of stupid cops in military okay it's the globalist it's only a few

[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.400]  I knew as soon as I gave the number out and only four callers got in there was a phone
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.240]  system problem because we can open the phone some get a hundred calls in it from
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.400]  our great listeners the phone system computer systems locked up so no more
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.400]  calls can come in we're gonna try to get that rebooted and keep taking your calls
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:02.000]  I've got a bunch of breaking news we'll cover after the break but right now let's
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.400]  go to Wilson and then Angie Wilson in Florida welcome
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:12.400]  hey good afternoon Alex it's always good to talk to you mama's student at Miami
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.920]  D College on Wolfson campus downtown and I'm very enthusiastic about the
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.800]  Constitution and about also Ron Paul because he is the one who's in force
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:26.960]  and you know and I've all I've even I'm a delivery driver and I even met during a
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.240]  delivery some Ron Paul supporters and they invited me to Duffy's Tavern one
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.400]  time about a week ago and it was having you know there was raising money and we
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.600]  had a lot of discussions there so I really am happy that there is people out
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:46.280]  there that are like me and like you and will stand stand up all right but I have
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:52.080]  two quick questions first question is why why don't we reenact the
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.640]  declaration that the signing of the Constitution and develop rights and start
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:01.720]  fresh you know my why can't we get the amount of delegates from each state and
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:06.920]  then just well it over you know listen that is actually if you read the John
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.640]  Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 it's got incredible language even
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:16.960]  crazier than the NDAA in many respects where it says we will create a 10 member
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.880]  governor council the states will have no more power those 10 governors serve the
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:29.560]  president and and and this in and this Defense Authorization Act of 2007 that
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:35.360]  went into effect 2008 is has sections on insurrection in the states even by
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.680]  legislatures so it's like an announcement that the federal district of
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:45.960]  criminals this this occupying alien system run by the banks the foreign
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:50.200]  banks is saying we're prepared for the state's rights movement and are
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.800]  prepared for war and of course they activated Northcom and Northcom is a
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.880]  military jurisdiction over the United States look at Africa is now a
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.960]  jurisdiction over Africa they just attack and kill whoever they want whenever
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:11.000]  they want anywhere now under NDAA 2012 that they passed in 2011 just a month
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:19.360]  ago exactly today it was the 31st of December 2011 they openly say there that
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.160]  worldwide without congressional approval the president or the military
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.960]  leadership the secretary of defense can kill anybody they want anytime attack
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:33.320]  any country or any person that's just global declaration of war that would
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:39.640]  make Hitler blush we'll kill our own citizens arrest them secretly
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:43.680]  disappear them and the senator Graham goes you bet we'll kill you you bet you
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.840]  don't get a lawyer I want you to be scared Santorum says hey we're already
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:53.360]  killing us citizens without charging them of course it's for killing Americans
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:57.920]  I mean these are terrorists who tell us that they're doing this to fight all
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:03.560]  kind of when Al Qaeda publicly works for them it's like the troops publicly
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:09.440]  grow the opium on the news and the cops are doing drag nets looking for heroin
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:17.200]  I mean it's it's bonker land cuckoo for cocoa puffs in our face crazy yeah I
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:22.280]  mean it's amazing it's like the media says vaccines don't cause autism but the
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:28.120]  insert says it can cause brain damage and geon berets and neurological
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:34.000]  disorders and Parkinson's and all the and or kill you I mean the insert says
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.640]  it can do it but then you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it's
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:43.600]  doing it and that's what I mean it's it's all insane it's insane it's insane
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:51.800]  it's insane it's crazy the UN runs giant child kidnapping rings publicly
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:57.360]  they've got private contractor groups that do it internationally running CPS
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:03.320]  all over the US they do it here it's already going on but people think it's
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:08.000]  no big deal because the media doesn't make a big issue out of it anything else
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:14.120]  sir yep yep I'm glad you know you put all the information I know we have a lot
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.280]  against us I'm very optimistic especially that we have such great

[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.520]  these two calls that have been holding then I'll get to some more of the news
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:36.160]  that's really important and then we will go back to your calls ahead of Dr.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.760]  Catherine Albrecht joining us to look at the attack on internet freedom worldwide
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:44.880]  what Google's up to and the rest of the story as Paul Harvey would say I'm going
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:49.840]  back to Wilson in Florida so Wilson you're saying you deliver stuff as I guess
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:52.680]  part of a courier service whatever you're doing so you're talking to a lot of
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.680]  wealthy people and you chat them up and they're aware of what's going on that's
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:03.760]  what I'm finding I cannot put numbers on it but it is exponential the fact that
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.920]  people are really getting it but even if they're getting that the government's
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:13.040]  corrupt and run by crooks they've got to get the fact that it's run by super
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:19.320]  nasty super evil people I mean the fact that the UN and others and our
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:22.960]  government is involved in the sex traffic including children I mean that
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:29.400]  is the worst of the worst I mean even in prisons those are the people that don't
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:35.680]  live a day I mean even amongst criminals rapists and murderers they don't put up
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:41.560]  with people that target kids I mean it's the worst of the worst of the worst and
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.720]  you automatically can't believe anything they say you automatically can't believe
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.680]  anything they do and it's never true anyways but these are confirmed known
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:57.000]  liars it's like the video I did last Friday that's gone viral at info wars
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.920]  com titled TSA the greatest liars on earth you want to fight them this is
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:08.520]  coffin nails this is cyanide to their lies this is holy water to the vampire
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:14.520]  this is high noon to a goblin you need to get that video and get it out to
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:20.480]  everybody you know it is so informative and it doesn't just cover TSA lies it
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.520]  covers government lies now I got some breaking news concerning the TSA that
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:27.600]  Kurt Nemo's working on right now but we're gonna go back to your calls
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:32.680]  finish up your point Wilson I appreciate your holding oh yep yep well um see like
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:37.520]  I said I also am a student Miami Dade and I deliver for pizza hut I know I'm
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.720]  nothing big but um I had a lot of extra copies from the last semester from the
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.280]  December 8th issue when I wrote an article it was titled the fun the
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.520]  father's combinations so I was passing out a whole bunch of those articles to
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:53.960]  almost every customer you know I got a lot of good feedback from a lot of
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:58.440]  people surprisingly you know some people show no interest when I gave it to them
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.120]  but the next time I showed up they was really enthusiastic but listen that's
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:07.000]  what you got to do we've all got to communicate and find our brothers and
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.480]  sisters in liberty there of every race color and creed we got to get together
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.280]  we've got to all communicate so we realize how many of us there are look
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:21.040]  look I tell this story all the time because it's so key I have been doing
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:26.320]  the 17 years and I got recognized right off the bat every once in a while but in
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.640]  the last decade everywhere I go I get recognized people buy me dinner when I'm
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.080]  in a restaurant I'm not asking folks to it's it's actually kind of it's weird
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.400]  when people do stuff for you but the point is now I can't walk the dog down
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:44.720]  the street I can't walk into a mall I can't go in a grocery store 10 feet I
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:49.400]  mean I go to the grocery store anywhere it's every third person it's it's I can
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.440]  go to foreign countries I can be in a sport fishing village in Honduras or I
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:57.440]  can be in southern Mexico and the and the and the tour bus drivers a listener I
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:04.840]  mean it is it and again I'm just one person so I'm telling you our numbers
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.800]  are much greater than we even know the average person isn't recognized isn't
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:17.040]  known isn't a quote public person and so you don't have an idea how awake people
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:24.480]  are I do I do folks and it is exciting go ahead sir so yep my last question is
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.080]  um I know you speak to Ron Paul alive I'll be voting tomorrow in the Flora
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:35.120]  primary but uh my question is before all this is over before he's I mean
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.520]  hopefully he does when the president see you know I think they'll be great for
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:45.040]  us but I would like to see if he could speak directly to the president on bomb
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:49.560]  and you know I I've never seen him speak directly to him and that would just I
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.000]  think that'll be amazing you know I think it'll be all over the news did you
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.160]  hear my last did you hear my last interview with Ron Paul about a
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:03.400]  month ago oh I must have not heard it yeah we should re-air it because it's
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:07.040]  probably the best interview I've ever done of over a hundred with him and I
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.480]  said to him I said congressman why are you attacking the other candidates I
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:14.480]  know you need to do that because of the records but I think you should do what
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:24.400]  Romney's doing attack up go after Obama and he said I agree with you I need to do
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:29.440]  that more and so I'm not gonna get in the middle of it Ron Paul's got a lot of
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.720]  great people working for him but he's also got kind of mainline Republican
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.120]  types as well because they're just part of the you know the establishment there
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.960]  in DC that's that's who there is available from that pool of people and
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:48.320]  he's got a great chief of staff in Congress but I'm not gonna sit here and
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:53.400]  second guess Ron Paul all day he's done a great job I don't think he should do
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.200]  so much retail politicking exhausting himself eight hours a day shaking hands
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.440]  I'm sorry he needs to hit him with electronic media that's that's where you
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.000]  people always want me to travel and speak here and do this that and talk to
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.800]  folks there and I do do some of that it's just that I turn down radio
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.080]  interviews every day where I'd be talking to tens of thousands or hundreds of
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:19.080]  thousands or millions so why should I travel and in the time that I do that
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.400]  and speak I could talk to five million people instead I go speak to a thousand
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:26.360]  and I understand it's important to do some of that but I just think he should
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:31.120]  go pretty much all electronic because he's he's old and it's exhausting him to
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.840]  do all that retail politicking and I think he should be savaging Obama as a
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.720]  lying globalist puppet and you know you know talk yeah I mean that would really
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.360]  fire up the Republican base as well God bless you I appreciate your call I've
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:50.080]  already brought it up to him I mean here's the deal I can I've got Ron Paul's
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.600]  home phone number I try to get all of them that way I know as some of his
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:58.280]  family I can call Congress I could call his can sometimes when they don't set
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.000]  him up for the show I've got to call the chief of staff and say hey they're not
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.360]  setting him up he wants to come on every month but it's every six eight weeks if
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.480]  he's too busy I understand and and and and then they go ask Ron Paul he's like
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:15.360]  no I want to come on and I've talked to Ron Paul you know before off air and it
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.880]  said hey do you want to come on every six months if you're busy because it's
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.320]  like pulling teeth to get you on he goes no we're just really busy I want to come
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.600]  on every month he doesn't say something he doesn't want to and then it's just
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:29.080]  pulling teeth getting through the gatekeepers because obviously he's super
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:33.120]  busy obviously it takes time he can't do everything so I'm not even blaming
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:37.720]  people there and I don't even try to give him my advice I rarely give Ron Paul
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:42.800]  advice I did last time he was on he's really smart guy he's always on top of
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:48.440]  every news item I raise he lives this stuff he is conscious he is awake and
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:53.000]  he's a real person he has basically no ego I can tell you looking at him and
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.200]  watching him he's in the machine mode I'm in the machine mode but I'm not
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:02.760]  disciplined enough to not get angry because it's so ridiculous how over the
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:06.320]  top the corruption is and I'm I mean I mean it's almost like after you've
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:10.200]  already convicted somebody 5,000 times okay they committed another 5,000
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:14.680]  murders we're gonna have 5,000 more trials and then sit here and try to
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:18.560]  convince people that we've got corrupt elites that are out of control I mean
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.280]  that's like convincing people to not jump off a cliff I mean I I shouldn't
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:32.280]  everybody should see this for themselves Ron Paul see I don't even want to get
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.120]  into the advice department for Ron Paul because he's the one in the arena right
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:40.720]  now and you know what he's got to take the punches that are getting thrown at
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.800]  him he's got to throw his punches and that's why I understand you want to give
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.720]  him advice I've given him that exact advice but then it just opens up a
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:57.800]  Pandora's box of of of issues so I just go through channels send our email hey
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.560]  we want to get Ron Paul on we'll tape it if you want or live whatever you want
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.680]  and then if I if that goes on sometimes for a couple weeks after you know a
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:11.320]  month then I have to like go above people's heads and get ahold of the top
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:20.040]  folks and but that happens in any organization Ron Paul's awesome but I
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:25.040]  want to explain to people don't be disillusioned this is what I said when I
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:28.920]  said you got to run for president again we're drafting you remember a year and
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:32.680]  a half ago remember Rand Paul I talked to him off air and on air I'm like you
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:37.120]  know you've really got to run well that's why I'm coming on your show to see if
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:40.680]  there's interest okay where's the exploratory website folks give him
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:46.080]  money and it was the money our audience on record gave him up front that made
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:49.680]  Rand Paul realize he could get the money and he needed it was our listeners on
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.720]  record that went and formed the core of his volunteers and that's why a lot of
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.840]  Rand Paul's people you know came right out of this audience that's why Ron Paul
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:03.480]  four years ago four plus years ago right before the New Hampshire primary out
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:07.680]  of the blue on my show said I want to thank your audience they've been half of
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:12.800]  our support I mean you look at Ron Paul on TV he's always signing info war shirts
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.120]  signing info wars bumper stickers he's always people are you know photograph
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:22.480]  with info wars bracelets on Ron Paul knows that he knows that half his support
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:28.080]  stills this radio show so this radio shows a big giant secret it's not a
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.720]  secret to those that are awake it's not a secret to those that listen but the
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:36.240]  establishment media has always tried to ignore the show like it didn't exist
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:42.360]  even though we have a bigger audience in most cases than they do see it's all
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:49.320]  about the pageantry it's all about the show it's all about makeup and perfect
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:54.440]  ties and perfect teleprompters and someone looking convincing when they
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:59.080]  talk to you you know when these teleprompters when they talk about a kid
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:04.080]  that's died it's they tell them look concerned or when they talk about
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:10.600]  Ron Paul it'll say you know look disgusted and then and and these people
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.960]  act like they know what they're talking about they get there 20 minutes
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:18.640]  before their makeup's all on they go in and they just sit there and try to look
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:23.640]  official I mean John Bounds worked in TV stations around the country he'll tell
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.840]  you that people show up they spend hours in there watching TV listen to radio
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:32.560]  playing around putting makeup on they come right out and read the teleprompter
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:36.520]  and sit there and act like they've got emotions and like they care about what
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:40.120]  you're saying and what you're doing and it's the emperors new clothes you know
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:47.160]  that whole parable he's all dressed up in these fancy outfit and he's really
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:50.440]  wearing no clothes at all but because everyone says look how beautiful his
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.600]  cloak is no one wants to admit he's actually butt naked in the parade until
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:58.840]  a two-year-old steps up and laughs and says the emperors naked and then
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:02.080]  somebody else laughs and then somebody else laughs all we got to do is call
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:06.880]  these crooks ridiculous bluff I look I gotta hurry through calls now Angie in
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:13.080]  North Carolina welcome hi Alice it's a pleasure to speak to you again you spoke
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:18.280]  to me recently and interviewed my husband about the blue force situational
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:23.840]  awareness that they were that they're setting up under the continuity programs
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:28.800]  I wanted to call and connect some really important dots that are floating around
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:32.560]  out there for people first I wanted to give you what I think might be a
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.640]  solution to your mainstream media moniker dilemma I think you should call
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.800]  them exactly what they are they're the mainstream mafia they are yeah that's a
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:51.720]  good name yeah okay in late fall around late October early November last year
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:57.520]  right around the time of the holidays a recommendation came out by the National
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:03.640]  Biodefense Science Board which is under Health and Human Services and they
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:11.920]  recommended that we not just revisit the issue they recommend that we actually
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:17.840]  begin to test anthrax vaccines on the pediatric population oh yeah I forgot to
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:23.840]  cover that guys will you type in government wants to test anthrax vaccine
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:27.800]  on children or wants to give anthrax vaccine to children that was in the
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.760]  news last week I didn't even cover it was in the Associated Press and for those
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.840]  that don't know they had to suspend it twice because it was killing the troops
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:39.680]  and so yes now the American Medical Association says they want to start
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:46.560]  forcing vaccines including experimental on the public go ahead my husband has
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.600]  actually had that vaccine he was in the first desert storm and he's got
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.680]  residual problems from that vaccine he's got problems with his memory and all
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:02.320]  kinds of issues and so does by the way a friend of ours who's a minister who
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:06.680]  there they were over him and his wife over for dinner last night he's also
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:11.120]  had that vaccine and he's also got issues as a result of it yeah well I'm
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:14.400]  sorry to tell you it's a soft kill it's it's meant that after a veteran served
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:18.080]  their time to be debilitating but there's ways to try to reverse it I've had
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:22.320]  medical doctors on there were there were actual court marshals that began as you
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:26.240]  know in Denver and other areas when their own doctors said look I just gave
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:31.520]  100 people this shot one of them died five were having convulsions something's
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:36.520]  wrong and they said put them in irons and again then they said you've got to
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:40.080]  follow orders to take the shot you have to take the shot if you're in the
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:45.680]  military but it's an approved confirmed vaccine but under law you cannot force a
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.680]  experimental shot on trips and it turns out they were using them as guinea pigs
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:55.920]  as you know go ahead right now that recommendation came out and some some
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:00.800]  websites wrote articles about it there was an article in science insider on
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:06.360]  October 28th and a quote from this article is even if this study goes
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:11.480]  forward it'll have to jump through hoops because a trial like this is without
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:17.080]  precedent and involves giving children a vaccine this is a quote that's almost
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:22.480]  certain not to benefit them and that might harm them all to protect but it's
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.280]  about setting the precedent to even give boys an MMR shot that killed girls in
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:30.920]  the trials and kills them now and doesn't protect you from the papillomavirus
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:35.200]  the insert says in fact we found the article let's put it on screen this is
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:40.400]  from medical news today federal government wants to test anthrax vaccine
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:45.160]  on children I'm sorry ma'am go ahead yeah what they're looking to do is the
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:49.600]  scientists are salivating for the data that they
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:54.280]  ethically cannot gather that's what they want to do it's not about protecting
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:49:00.360]  anybody from a ridiculously unlikely ma'am you know what's going on I mean
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:04.280]  anybody can look this up until three years ago every doctor every nurse was
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.040]  trained everyone knew you don't give a pregnant woman vaccines it's been proven
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:14.680]  to cause deformities health problems and miscarriages now instead they flip it
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:19.200]  and say pregnant women are who you want to give all the shots and it's killing
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:24.400]  them they're testing bold in your face killing us and getting away with it go
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:30.760]  ahead well the president Obama with the passage of an executive order number
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:39.040]  13521 on November 24th of 2009 he established the bioethics committee now
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:44.920]  the bioethics committee first of all it the website is bioethics.gov and it's
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:49.760]  a treasure trove of information if you guys have time to comb through it
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:55.000]  there's transcriptions on the sites of all the meetings they've had so far and
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.560]  meetings they've got coming up about all kinds of unbelievable things such as
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:06.240]  what meeting for session 10 they talked about testing directed energy weapons on
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:12.480]  the population and you know I think it's a kind of a test situation to find out
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.360]  what the population knows about certain things but on November I'm sorry on
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:23.360]  January 6th Kathleen Sebelius submitted a letter now if you go to the new section
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:30.120]  under bioethics.gov on January 11th I believe it was they posted the blog
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:35.640]  about a January 6th letter that came from Kathleen Sebelius and in this letter
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:42.560]  she asked them to convene a panel do you want to take this break yeah we'll go to
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:46.000]  break and come back with that yeah for those that don't know bioethics is

[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:31.080]  he never gives an answer but the fool I mean here's another article I just typed
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:37.520]  in anthrax vaccine children and leave this headline major drug maker accused
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:43.320]  of killing 14 trial suspects suspects I guess the children are suspects to be
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:49.480]  killed subjects there's a CNN report Argentina finds drug company over
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:55.600]  vaccine deaths and of course it's vaccine company coming at you with the
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:00.320]  anthrax shots the Nuremberg code provides ethical guidelines for medical
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:03.760]  research to protect human death subjects and scientific experiments from
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:09.160]  injury disability or death but our government violates that I mean they
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:12.520]  do it on foster kids ladies and gentlemen when you learn that you're
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:16.640]  seen as lab rats literally and that you're seen as scum and trash by the
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.320]  ruling class and this is all a big medical experiment the whole thing the
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:24.600]  TV the fluoride in the water the GMO the drugging of school kids when you wake
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:29.880]  up to just how horrifying it is and you learn that they're setting up these
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:34.160]  death panels that they're telling doctors what health care you can give
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:38.760]  people Bill Gates admits this Newsweek says the case for killing granny and
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:43.640]  shows granny being unplugged and now they're gonna have the federal bioethics
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.360]  board coming out saying yes we're just gonna give your kids shots whether you
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:53.040]  like it or not the this is an assault but they've learned to slow kill you
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:57.560]  these just shoots you up screw you up and kind of walk off giggling this is
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:01.640]  how the creepy technocrats hit you and hit you hard I need to get to other
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.720]  callers Angie was finishing up your point about this go ahead right well so
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:10.640]  Kathleen Sibelius wrote this letter on January 6th asking this bioethics
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:17.080]  commission to convene a board to review basically how to get around the ethical
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:23.240]  issues with testing this anthrax vaccine on children so and she also
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:32.520]  recommends that they gather pre and post trial information so she wants them to
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:39.040]  give her ways to get around the ethical problems with testing the AVA which is
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:44.160]  the anthrax vaccine absorbed in the pediatric population by the way it
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:47.800]  doesn't even prevent them from getting sick if there's an anthrax attack this
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.680]  is actually it's not a vaccine it's more a treatment for what they call post
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:58.840]  exposure prophylaxis which means that it will stop certain symptoms after
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:04.800]  exposure to the anthrax let's see they've got a beta test just killing the
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.640]  kids out in the open I mean the dead mount the cancer mounts leading the
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:12.000]  world in every disease now and they just sit there with straight faces going we

[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:16.240]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:21.160]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:25.560]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.280]  grid is joining us we've got some breaking news on the Super Bowl all cover as

[02:00:53.280 --> 02:01:00.640]  holding. All right hello Alex I was just thinking about the tracking
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:04.960]  mechanisms that they have available like for example they can track you through a
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:09.760]  lot of driver's license now if God forbid this does turning into a shooting
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:14.200]  war it might be a good idea to dump your wallet so to speak. Well all you got to
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:19.920]  do is fry the RFID chip that are on them but but I mean in the future you're not
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:23.560]  going to buy and sell without your face scan approving it which is just a
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:27.640]  digital you know camera it's going in everywhere they admit that's their plan
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:31.240]  it's always been the plan of this architecture and and and the big thing
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:35.360]  is piling fees on every transaction they're gonna have a global sales tax
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:40.640]  national sales tax carbon taxes so even when you pay cash you notice now in
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:45.800]  Louisiana they've banned cash for retail sales did you see that last year? Oh man
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:52.240]  this is all about control sir. Yeah well yeah that's true I mean it's amazing
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:57.880]  one of the things I wanted to say was that in the early 90s I was with Sam
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:02.520]  Sherwood's militia in Idaho and one of his inner circle one of the things we
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:06.240]  were that was brought to our attention was the method for killing heat
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:11.640]  signature basically put a space blank where a space blanket underneath an
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.720]  army poncho theoretically it's supposed to kill 90% of your heat signature God
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:18.400]  forbid it goes to a shooting where that gives the Patriots the hell of an
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:22.880]  advantage. No that's true they say you can actually take the space blanket and
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:26.680]  basically show it in there's a lot of other ways to do that and that's why the
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:30.960]  globalists are moving to drones domestically I mean the military has
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:35.800]  over 20,000 drones 7,000 plus predators alone they're going to the armed systems
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.960]  the reapers and others and they admit they're going to use them domestically
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:43.240]  against us again an illegitimate criminal government overtaken by foreign
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:49.560]  banks engaging in every crime you can imagine. One final thing I'd like to
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:54.520]  say is that I would suggest that every Patriot out there if you know get right
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:58.680]  with God get right with Jesus because if he is with you who could possibly be
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:02.640]  against you. I agree with that and and also make
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:07.120]  a while the sun shines reach out to everybody do banner hangs put info
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:10.880]  wars.com or other websites on the side of your barn or your house or your
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.200]  business or you know out there on the side in front of your your hamburger
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:18.880]  joint make copies of my film Obama Deception fall the Republic in game
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:23.280]  give them away free at your restaurant or at your grocery store or at your
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:28.800]  five and dime or at your convenience store or sell them buy them in bulk and
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:34.200]  sell them or print up your own pamphlets hand out your own business cards do
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:39.360]  banner hangs on the highway I mean that there's a lot we can do to to to really
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:46.360]  get the word out about what's happening. Yeah I loved in game I never
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:51.360]  realized how rotten Charles Darwin really was until I saw that. Well they took
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:54.800]  out of what Darwin's whole family was a eugenics family they were all
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:59.040]  interbreeding to create a master race the Gaultons the Wedgewoods the Huxley's
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:03.960]  all of them and of course it didn't create a master race within four
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:08.360]  generations most children were stillborn or seriously mentally retarded but it
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.840]  did create a few idiots of aunts that did survive because they did originally
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:15.520]  come out of very smart families but four families all intermarried in the test
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:20.480]  and yeah that and they created social Darwinism for eugenics out of it and
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:23.920]  they developed the plan for the scientific dictatorship and that's what
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:30.040]  we're under brother. I know I hear you and I just wish there was some way
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:35.680]  people could you know like say just pick a day in which they can all like at
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:41.080]  noon just stick their head out a window and just scream no new Ron Paul or
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:44.920]  something like that you know just make it really known that they don't approve
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:52.840]  of this new gingrich. I mean you know what I mean Diane. What do you mean don't
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:56.480]  approve of new gingrich absolutely I can't stand new gingrich. I mean he's a
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:59.800]  globalist demon appreciate the call.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:04.800]  Hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:08.760]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:12.360]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:15.760]  gold. It's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this

[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:24.160]  also again as I said have your calls there but the point is the internet is
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:28.680]  obviously just a computer communication system but now it's being wired into all
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:33.720]  your appliances your television sets your smartphones and it's controlling the
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:37.280]  architecture of our technological development and these global
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:41.880]  corporations and governments get together on record and conspire to make
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:49.080]  you pay for Trojan horse surveillance systems in the products you purchase and
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:56.120]  we've gone from government denying that they're spying on us to now just saying
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:59.400]  yeah we're spying on everything I mean you'll take Pennsylvania a few years ago
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:02.040]  people didn't believe that when it first came out in the mainstream news oh
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:07.520]  yeah the school announced and titled on themselves the laptops the free laptops
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:10.880]  that taxpayers pay for nothing's free that we sent home with you we're
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:14.520]  watching you in the shower we're watching you in your bed we're watching
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:20.520]  you at home we're watching you and they sent the police after some kid because
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:24.240]  they were eating Skittles and thought they were pills so government is
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:29.920]  announcing more and more on itself and the big issue is the plan is face
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:34.440]  scanning thumb printing to buy and sell part of national and global sales taxes
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:38.700]  VAT and carbon tax this is all announced and then they're gonna add fines and
[02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:42.560]  fees and other regs you think five bucks use your smart cards bad for Bank of
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:48.520]  America or your debit card just wait everything with RFID everything face
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:53.680]  scanned by law look at Louisiana saying you can't use cash in second-hand
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:57.400]  transactions all of you are criminals you've got to go to a big box store
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:01.400]  cracking down the lemonade stands the Girl Scout cookies arresting people
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:07.040]  selling lemonade arresting kids playing tag arresting kids for running on the
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:12.400]  schoolyard just type it into the search engine folks and you will see
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:16.560]  associated press going yeah is it good to arrest five-year-olds for running on
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:22.720]  the playground I showed it to you last hour this is really happening and on the
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:26.440]  backs of all of this just out today London Guardian Thailand backs Twitter
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:30.280]  censorship policy the government becomes first to publicly endorse Twitter's
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:34.360]  decision to permit country specific censorship of content so the West wants
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:38.200]  to overthrow their old dictator in Egypt or another dictator like Assad in
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:43.600]  Syria oh they're all for the rebels that are CIA funded on record I'm not saying
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:47.800]  I like Syria I'm like saying I like housing mubarak the point is is it's
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:53.040]  selective they let them use it but then and criticize mubarak for shutting it
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:56.120]  down but everywhere else they're saying they're going to shut it down we've
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:59.600]  already seen cell phones in San Francisco shut down during protests and
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:03.160]  nobody can take photos or shoot video we're already seeing calls for this
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.480]  here Google's announcing they're gonna be helping people censor over the web
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:10.840]  they're announcing you have no privacy now they're gonna integrate all this
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:15.000]  Catherine all of it's going to be breaking it down with us here's another
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.240]  one acta is worse than so pa here's what you need to know and it breaks down the
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:26.080]  fact this global treaty that Obama has now signed and and homeland security is
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:31.320]  involved in all of that so it's all rolling out with the troops on the
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:36.000]  streets the surveillance the casualist society that is about shutting you down
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.360]  if you're not a good globalist shutting down black markets once you've had your
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:45.200]  mega count shut down it's all about targeting everyone it's all about a
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:49.920]  managed controlled economy and dr. Catherine albert joins us to break this
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:53.840]  down I mean Catherine what we're seeing is everything come out in the open from
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:13:00.640]  the NDAA to the wars to the torture to the police state we are seeing the
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:05.560]  censorship come out in the open we're seeing the fact that al Qaeda is being
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:09.680]  protected and put in power in Libya by Western powers everything is pretty much
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:13.880]  coming out right now that's panicking the system in this open free information
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:20.080]  society the mainstream media is dying so it's a perfect storm of the old dying
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:24.880]  media and corrupt governments knowing that we're awake to them wanting now to
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:28.880]  try to put the genie back in the bottle and their attempt to shut down our free
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.160]  speech has really I think backfired Catherine all of it thank you for
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:36.480]  joining us hey it's great to be on Alex and you totally hit the nail on the head
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:40.080]  in fact this whole thing out of Thailand they actually wanted to put an all-out
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:44.880]  block on all social media from the West and we're citing China is a good example
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:49.440]  to follow so obviously of Thailand and China and Iran I know you reported on
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:52.120]  this a couple years ago when it happened when they had those riots in the
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:56.560]  street and we're shooting protesters they told all the journalists get lost we
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:13:59.960]  don't want any journalist in here they cordoned it off and people were we're
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:04.720]  taking photos posting on the web from their smartphones and getting right
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:08.840]  around that so that's where they want to put these kind of filters on to all all
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:13.120]  of these websites and those countries they come out and say it openly you know
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.920]  you look at China and you say all right well China's gonna come right out and
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:21.560]  say you have no freedom you can't just do whatever you want North Korea is a
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:26.080]  perfect example and what you're pointing out is that our government now is
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:29.920]  starting to do the same thing the things that used to be whispered about and
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:34.120]  considered conspiracy theory are now openly published their open statements
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:38.080]  their open policies same thing is true obviously with the search engines you've
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:42.400]  got you know Google and Yahoo and Bing which for years if you were over in
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:46.160]  Beijing and you typed in Tiananmen Square because you wanted to find out
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:50.320]  about the massacre but you were behind the walls of China you would not get
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:54.400]  those search engines would actually censor your results and and only show
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:58.560]  you happy families picnicking in the park and so from behind that iron wall of
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:03.040]  China you could not even discover that they're a better massacre why because
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:06.120]  all the information that we get nowadays we're getting through the search engines
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:10.720]  we're getting through these big companies and all it takes is for one
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:14.360]  government to get three or four of them to say yeah we'll all get on board and
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:18.520]  we'll shut down and censor your information and we could be to back to
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:23.520]  the dark ages I mean we could be worse than Soviet Stalin Soviet Union where
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:27.920]  there was only one source of information notice Russia notice Russia is now
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:33.000]  endorsing a bunch of internet censorship so all these governments you
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.080]  who are more and more getting exposed they have a dog in the fight wanting to
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:41.440]  curtail like I said the old dinosaur prostitute media they're hopping up and
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:46.440]  down supporting it because they want to see their competition shut down and and
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:51.160]  as we go into this world depression the the system is going to try to start
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:54.800]  shutting down the web it may mean Homeland Security launches a false flag
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:58.520]  against the web and says foreign terrorists have done it you know they've
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:02.720]  said during a flu outbreak they may shut down the whole web and only direct you
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:07.760]  to White House website where you get a message so they can control information
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:12.200]  during emergencies or during a new war the point is they're openly trying to
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:17.000]  sell this idea of censorship now not just of the internet but of talk radio
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:21.720]  Cass Sunstein the regulations are as you know Catherine has called for censoring
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:26.720]  people that don't believe in man-made global warming I mean they are really
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:31.400]  authoritarians and I think it's starting to backfire on them that they're being so
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:35.640]  obvious yeah I think so too and you know I was just talking to my show recently
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:39.760]  about this this article that came out should Google take the crazy off of the
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:44.280]  internet and somebody actually came out and said with a straight face that and
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:48.280]  this was like in Forbes so you know this is this is not just some guy's blog but
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:52.800]  came out and said we really think that Google should start flagging websites
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:57.680]  that don't meet basic criterion of accepted scientific fact and they were
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:01.960]  talking about creation websites they were talking about 9-11 truth websites
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:05.800]  they were talking about Obama birth certificate concern websites and you
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:09.440]  know political type issues and saying that first Google should start off by
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:13.680]  putting a little flag and saying these are not you know vetted by Google or
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:17.720]  these are not approved websites or these are crazy websites and then of course
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:21.160]  your next step I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see your next step
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:23.600]  from that is going to be saying well let's just make sure those aren't even
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:27.600]  there and well they said that I mean Google's already de-listed us two years
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:33.040]  ago from their Google news function you guys got you guys got kind of some
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:38.280]  screw which they're on YouTube too not long ago all sorts of stuff I mean Paul
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:42.480]  Watson's been in areas of Europe and in England and they have the government free
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:47.680]  Wi-Fi the train stations in full wars in prison planet hasn't noticed this is
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:52.640]  extreme you're not allowed to go there unbelievable so yeah and and this is why
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:56.280]  you know the last the last week of course last week Google made its big
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:00.440]  announcement that it's going to take all of its products all 60 of its privacy
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:04.720]  policies 60 plus privacy policies consolidate them into one and you know
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:09.160]  you look around and I'm just working on an essay called when did Google become a
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:14.840]  verb you know we are all unthinkingly logging on to this website and doing
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:18.920]  much more than we realize we're doing by using these services I have some friends
[02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:22.000]  who are in the privacy movement who are in the freedom movement who use Google
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.200]  voice I'm like dudes have you read the privacy policy do you realize that that
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:30.240]  that service is recording every phone call you make every one of your kind
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:36.320]  Google email it means that they read your email and store it you got it so so this
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:41.120]  is this I think it's interesting this is a good time and I know everybody says
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:43.900]  what are you talking about Catherine it's the worst but I say this is a good

[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:09.760]  alright right back to privacy expert Dr. Catherine Albrick short segment long
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:14.200]  segment coming up Catherine this is a short seg you've got the floor here what
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:18.360]  are some of the other threats we see developing and and the unification of
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:23.480]  how all these spy systems are tied in together well you know the internet
[02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:27.480]  Alex's is anybody who's been watching it for the last 15 years has become the
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:32.120]  backbone of virtually everything we do and you know it's not just the internet
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:35.160]  it's the fact that our phone calls are now being routed through it you've got
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:39.680]  lots of people using voice over IP you've got essentially this data cloud
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:43.920]  that's also being created and all of the stuff that we do is about to wind up on
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:46.520]  the internet and I think that's why it like Google's announcement is so
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:50.920]  interesting because Sergey Brin back in the founding of Google or after the
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:54.000]  founding of Google a couple of years ago was asked you know what do you envision
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.880]  Google becoming you know what's the ultimate search engine and his answer
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:01.200]  was like the mind of God and you know you put all that together and you say
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:04.200]  okay so we are creating essentially and you and I've talked about this before
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:10.520]  on the show we're creating a kind of a backbone or a nervous system across
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:14.400]  this planet and I've said this before it's not accidental that we call it the
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:19.320]  net you know a net traps things it's not accidental we call it a web because a
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:22.840]  web traps things we are creating if you could stand it out of space and see all
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:26.760]  of the interconnected links of information flow across this planet it
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:30.880]  would look an awful lot like a net or a web and the things that ultimately are
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:35.800]  going to be caught in that are us and so as these things consolidate you know I
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:40.960]  was just rereading 1896 King Camp Gillette what a name his parents named him
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:46.480]  King the guy who created the Gillette Razor company and came up he was the
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:50.240]  first by the way back in 1896 back in the 1800s he was the first guy to come
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:54.080]  up with a disposable consumer product which is fascinating to me because now
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:56.800]  virtually everything you buy is disposable and that he was the guy who
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:00.400]  created that prior to that everybody had a straight razor and they sharpened it
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:03.760]  with a strop and you get one when you came of age you make it another one when
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:07.320]  you got married and that was it for life you had one razor and so he came up with
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:11.480]  this disposable concept that now is polluted our whole our whole planet but
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:16.080]  one of the things that he was working on back then was this idea that left to
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:21.720]  its own devices capitalism was going to lead to one single store one single
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:24.200]  manufacturer for everything he was basically talking about
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:28.720]  communism socialism you know the central control and when I was looking at that I
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:33.240]  was thinking well so that's Walmart you know back in 1896 this Gillette guy was
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:37.320]  predicting Walmart well he didn't have the ability to do it yet but he could
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:41.560]  have been predicting Google because it's the same concept you've got in the same
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:46.040]  way that Walmart is like how people buy stuff nowadays and has the power to snuff
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.560]  out of their companies and eliminate competition and you know I reported on
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:54.480]  this a couple years ago in England some commentator on the on the supermarket
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:57.680]  industry said England is too big for three supermarkets we're gonna have to
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:02.320]  get it down to two and eventually one so everything's moving to this hugeness
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:06.360]  consolidation and we're gonna start seeing the same thing on the internet
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:09.160]  we're already seeing it you know I remember back in the 90s when I was a
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:13.280]  graduate student at Harvard and we were like the first people to ever use the
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:17.480]  internet it was new it was not graphical it was all text it was you know hard to
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:21.760]  navigate and we were like how cool you know there's a million people on here
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:25.120]  they're all doing their own thing now you go on the internet and virtually
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:29.720]  everything is under these couple of few umbrellas as you well know so that's why
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:33.520]  I think alternative radio I think supporting info wars supporting what
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.280]  I'm doing over at my radio show at Catherine Albright comm supporting all
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:42.000]  of the alternative sources of news is gonna be crucial and in the same way
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.080]  when you start looking and again I think the reason everybody got scared
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:50.320]  about this Google announcement is all of a sudden you've got them pulling tight
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.040]  the reins it's like the net was sort of loosely kind of being built around us we
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:56.960]  didn't realize it and now they're pulling it and that was always the plan
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:01.720]  make it ubiquitous get it into everything standardized the TVs everything
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:05.480]  where they're plugged in the smart meter spying on what you're doing in your
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:12.560]  house off of algorithms I mean it's all now just suddenly admitted and then
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:18.240]  Google says we're gonna integrate all the platforms we have and share what
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:22.160]  you're doing with everyone and Schmidt comes out and says you shouldn't be
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:25.680]  doing it if you don't want people to know well wait a minute I close my blinds
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:30.000]  at night because I want privacy or I don't want the sunlight coming in it
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:34.680]  doesn't mean I should live in a glass house because you say so and he operated
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:39.960]  for 12 years like don't be evil will always keep your data secret we've
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:44.400]  never had a data breach we promise we won't do that and now they're going you
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:50.280]  know what we are evil we always planned it we're taking over and it just shows
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:54.880]  like I said a few weeks ago when Sopa I was getting shot down I said that's good
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:59.040]  but it's only because the big mega globalists like Google they're already
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:02.880]  going to implement a global model through Davos and other systems they
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:06.680]  don't want governments ham fistedly doing it they don't want the recording
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:11.880]  industry coming in with something that screws up their more subtle ways to
[02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:16.320]  phase in censorship they're like wait a minute don't run off all the geese we're
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:19.720]  gonna put them all in one big net and catch all of them not shoot one with a
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:24.640]  shotgun recording industry shut up you idiots shut down we're gonna show you
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:28.600]  how you censor we're gonna show you how it's done Catherine stay there we're
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:32.080]  gonna come right back get more of your views on that and how we stop these
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:37.720]  folks and absolutely it is the highest rated of the search engines that don't
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:43.400]  spy on you start page dot com another subsidiary of x quick and I guess that's
[02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:46.960]  the European name for it and there's some others out there but we've all got
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:51.080]  to stop using the term Google as the word for search engine we're on the

[02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:08.640]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:12.880]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:17.160]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:21.520]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:25.440]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:30.160]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:34.280]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:38.240]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:42.080]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:44.800]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:31.840]  listen folks I get up here like a machine gun and just rattle through all the
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:35.200]  crimes the globalists are committing and cover all the different facets of it
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:40.680]  but it's real there are powerful interests that want monopolies that
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:44.880]  want to control your life who will give billions of dollars to their buddies
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:49.840]  companies to never build a single you know alternative energy system because
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:54.160]  they never intended to who will shut down power plants in your area so their
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:59.240]  power plant that's in with the government will make ten times the money
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:04.240]  where they'll shut down a pipeline bringing us oil so that Warren Buffett
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:09.520]  can ship it by train to the coast to send it to China and then Warren Buffett
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:15.560]  pays the news media on record Aaron was pointing this out to me yesterday to put
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:19.080]  out PR stories about what a philanthropist he is when he actually put
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:24.240]  his money in a tax-free foundation and makes money off of it and they're
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:30.080]  buying up big pharma companies vaccines Bill Gates is involved with him it is
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:36.560]  beyond out of control and internet to going back twelve years ago this
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:42.360]  consortium would meet and admit it's going to be big business academia and
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:45.840]  government they're going to control the new internet and they're going to make
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:49.080]  you sign agreements to be on their platforms and then they can shut you
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:54.960]  down anytime they want it's the privacy agreements it's the terms of use and
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:35:00.280]  they own what you're doing you have all your rights and the old web is just
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:06.560]  shut down now a way to boil it down as you hear about net neutrality where
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:09.600]  companies say you've got to pay us to go over our routers even though you're
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:13.600]  already paying for the internet connection so this is about getting the
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:17.960]  whole world economy wired into this letting it be free for a while and
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:21.280]  then coming in and taking it over it's like toll road companies letting you
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:29.880]  build big highways with taxpayer money the gas tax is paying for it all they
[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:33.120]  call it privatization but it's not really they hand it over even though
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:37.120]  it's still government-financed to a private management company that then
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:42.560]  puts a new lane on it with paint and technically says well now we're allowed
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:46.400]  to put a toll road on it even though the laws say you can't toll existing roads
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:49.680]  so they're just hijacking our infrastructure and this is what the
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:53.240]  IMF and World Bank have done in the third world it's now coming here look
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:58.080]  at the austerity in Europe look at Europe signing on to this new internet
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:05.520]  censorship treaty the Acta look at how they're announcing that they're going
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:09.400]  to raise everybody's taxes to quote pay off the debt but most the debt isn't
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:18.880]  even the people's own debt the debt is incurred by the mega banks
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:24.480]  Catherine does it ever make your head spin just to see the enormity of this
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:30.680]  planned economy unfolding it is it can be a little overwhelming doesn't it it
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:33.960]  can leave you a little bit stunned and you know I always try to encourage people
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:39.240]  though because it can be so easy to just say ah it's it's too much we can't fight
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:43.040]  back there's nothing we can do and then I take a look and one of the things that's
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:47.280]  really encouraged me in the last probably decade or so has been the the
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:51.280]  natural foods market you know just just organic foods if you just think about
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:55.240]  that alone and obviously that's just one tiny little sliver but there was a
[02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:58.400]  time you know 10 15 years ago when those of us who were saying wait a minute
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:01.560]  they're putting all this garbage and there's hydrogenated vegetable oil and
[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:05.520]  corn syrup and it's all in our food and everybody's getting sick and then
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:10.080]  little by little the activists the people telling their friends the listeners
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:14.080]  like your listeners sending emails and distributing your information getting
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:18.480]  the word out created a grassroots movement that has now made the organics
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:23.320]  market the fastest moving food market in the country today so obviously that's
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:27.840]  just one sliver but I encourage people not to give up and not to lose heart
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:31.000]  because there are projects that people have been working on for you know three
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.360]  four years and they say it's not getting anywhere we're not getting any
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:38.040]  traction and then you look up and you go wait a minute things are changing so
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:41.720]  don't don't lose hope and I think the key thing and this is why I think the
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:45.840]  internet is where this whole fight really comes together you know you can
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:49.840]  talk agenda 21 you can talk toll roads you can talk North American Union you
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:54.480]  can talk all this stuff but where where the crux really is is this internet this
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:59.440]  ability to communicate because if they can shut that off if they can keep us
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:03.480]  from communicating if they can censor watch and filter us and make sure that
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:06.880]  you can't even log on to send an email without a thumbprint that puts you
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:11.400]  through some FBI computer that makes sure you're pre-approved if we can't
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:16.160]  communicate with each other at that point then anything they want to do is
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:21.520]  going to be doable so the key and this is why I'm such a huge supporter of your
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:27.520]  radio program it's why I do radio it's why I encourage people you start page
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:33.480]  dot com get a private email address pay attention because and don't just fall
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:36.920]  into the easiness trap you know it's really easy to just flip on and listen
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:41.480]  to you know whatever mainstream media is blathering out on your car radio if
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:45.760]  you if you don't take the time to try to find some real radio it's really easy
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:49.640]  to just use whatever default search engine is on your browser which is going
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:55.240]  to be Google it's simple it's hard to say let me find Alex Jones let me listen
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:59.000]  to Catherine Albrecht let me find star page dot com let me let me make those
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.360]  switches and the thing I liken it to Alex do you remember back when there was
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:06.840]  really nothing but Microsoft word that's all you had was just Microsoft and
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:12.160]  everybody all of a sudden started typing in Times New Roman 12 point font like
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:17.040]  overnight like everybody just used that one font because those were the default
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:22.160]  settings and this is kind of a phrase that I use a lot just just in my own
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:25.400]  work is I think all right what are the default settings are the default setting
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:29.120]  is what you're always talking about the with different language you know you're
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:33.440]  born you go to K through 12 you do 12,000 hours of public school government
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:37.160]  school seat time to be indoctrinated and then you go and you go to your
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:42.160]  college or your whatever job and then you retire and you pay your taxes and
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:45.160]  that's the end of you and and meanwhile you're being watched controlled
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:49.160]  manipulated and used and that that's the default setting other people are
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:53.440]  finding ways to switch that off let's homeschool our kids let's you know let's
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:56.280]  take an alternative way of getting through the education system let's take
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:59.080]  an alternative way of finding out information let's find an alternative
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:02.480]  way searching the internet or sending email or making phone calls or whatever
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:07.040]  it is and it's really turning off those default settings and being conscious
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:11.720]  about it and let me tell you people are ready that's why that's the secret is
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:15.120]  it is an alternative organic food to an alternative and that's the secret
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:19.560]  because sure 15 years ago you couldn't find organic food anywhere people put
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:24.040]  pressure on the system and so it created an economy now the establishment has
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:30.440]  created subgroups and clones of craft and the rest of it that masquerade as true
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:35.600]  organic but people now get wise to that I mean this is an ongoing fight and it's
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:41.480]  the same thing with the standardization at Disney World or Sea World or now to
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:45.040]  get library books to biometrically scan you we've just got to learn to say
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:49.640]  no because once that standardized now they're going to do it where you have
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:54.200]  to do that to buy and sell in their own words so they can put taxes and
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:59.200]  regulations on you like the five dollars to use your ATM card at Bank of
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:03.360]  America they were going to set the standard industry-wide but had to back
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:08.680]  off take so pa that shows the power we've got and where we really learn how
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:13.160]  much the system really wants the power grab is in what they always ask for up
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:17.520]  front take about a year ago the cyber security command already in place and
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:22.040]  running under North coms admitted we want all IT professionals certified by
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:27.280]  the federal government member and working for us and even small internet
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:31.640]  companies in small towns we have to have our hubs in there you have to work for
[02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:35.400]  us you have to sign all these agreements I mean they want a total
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:41.560]  authoritarian control grid and let's not forget Google Microsoft especially but
[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:47.400]  yahoo all of them son micro systems Cisco they helped build the great
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:52.000]  electronic firewall of China they helped build what's going in worldwide they
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.400]  know how to censor and so they're now attempting this so people better use the
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:02.520]  free web to fight for its future but to also fight like it's not going to be
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:07.320]  here you see folks everything is accelerating in this phase everything
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:12.600]  is quickening right now the wars the tyranny the checkpoints the TSA and now
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:15.720]  announcing they're going to be in the airport parking lots I told you'd first
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:19.640]  be at the concourse you know the then in the parking lots now at your shopping
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:23.840]  malls that starting they're going to be at the Super Bowl groping people they're
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:28.600]  training your local police highway checkpoints I mean it's all here it's
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:34.440]  all happening and Catherine what do you see unfolding as this awakening
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:38.720]  accelerates and the tyrants realize we're waking up and try to rush in to
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.560]  block us and accelerate their incremental plan well you know we have an
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:46.360]  interesting window right now Alex because we have more ability to organize
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:50.880]  and communicate now than any people at any time in the past ever in all of human
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:55.040]  history and I think that the the is you call them the globalists the people who
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:58.920]  want to shut all this down they are hoping beyond hope that we do not
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:02.640]  actually collectively recognize the power that we have before they can get
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:06.360]  rid of it I really do believe that that is well that's it exactly we either
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:11.280]  recognize our power and use it are beslaves in a technocratic technotronic
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:17.040]  system that they they call it a scientific dictatorship they call it an
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:21.760]  authoritarian system the Economist magazine Newsweek time every day I see
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:25.240]  articles where the establishment mouthpieces are saying Catherine
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:30.120]  tyranny is good the experts are going to run things it won't be a Mussolini or
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:34.720]  a Hitler and a clown outfit it's going to be ruled by these corporate globalist
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:38.200]  bureaucrats let me let me get your take on that but then I want to give you some
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:42.080]  Bill Gates news oh Bill Gates news all right well I'm always up for that because
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:46.560]  he's an interesting character in player and all of this yeah the the the key
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:49.960]  thing and again I keep coming back to the same point we've got to take the
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:54.520]  tools that we have and hang on to them with both hands kicking and screaming to
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:57.840]  not let go of them that's why the whole SOPA protest regardless of whether it
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.600]  was the corporate guys doing it I think it sent a message to the general public
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:06.480]  that wait a minute so there is a power game going on and we can use the
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:10.920]  internet to stop something that seems more powerful like you know basically
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:15.680]  Congress so the SOPA thing was a beautiful experience I think for us
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:20.320]  nationally as a nation of people who want freedom to say oh wait a minute so
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:23.400]  things can change and I want people to grab ahold of that even if you don't
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:26.960]  like the companies that did it or the websites that did it doesn't matter the
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:31.360]  reality is that that was a perfect example of the internet coming together
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:34.760]  coalescing and what is the internet basically other than us coming together
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:38.080]  and coalescing collectively putting their foot down and saying heck no you're
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:41.960]  not going to do you know whatever it is well that's it that's it but the internet
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:46.560]  is even more than that it is the future architecture of commerce and of all
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:51.200]  technological systems it is the integrated high-tech society and they're
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:55.840]  trying to twist the architecture into total control well and this is why I
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:59.920]  got a couple of things I want to recommend people use cash use it or
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:04.320]  lose it because cash is your only anonymous payment method and not only
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:06.640]  anonymous because a lot of people say well I don't care people know what I buy
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:11.800]  doesn't matter because your credit card number can be turned off your $50 bill
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:15.440]  cannot you know without a whole lot of whole other kind of thing going on that
[02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:20.760]  everybody's going to notice but don't rely so much on these electronic things
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:24.680]  and notice they're already trying to demonize cash they're already are trying
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:28.560]  to get rid of it because once they've got you cashless there's no escaping all
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:32.680]  the fines and fees that's right and not only not only the fines fees and taxes
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:35.560]  and them getting their cut of every single thing you do but also the
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:40.640]  traceability the trackability and more importantly their ability to say no so
[02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:43.600]  you know you you look at some of these insurance companies and they've actually
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:47.160]  had conversations about using your frequent shopper card that's why I got
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:50.040]  started in all this using this the card that you're showing it Safeway or
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:54.840]  Kroger or wherever you're shopping and using it to say you are overweight or you
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:58.800]  have high blood pressure and so you cannot buy these particular items and
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:01.920]  when you scan your card rather than making it discounts it's going to be the
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:05.960]  mandatory scan of your ID card and we're going to make you put back all the
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:11.040]  things on your shopping they're already they're already doing stuff like that I
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:14.080]  saw a case of years ago where the guy admitted to rank a six pack of beer
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:19.960]  every night to his doctor and so it was a bizarre story how they then gave him a
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:24.240]  DWI even though he wasn't driving I mean they're now arresting five-year-olds
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:28.600]  that run on the playground associated press Catherine yeah I it's it's where
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:31.360]  we're going so if people don't want to live in that kind of world and I think
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:35.720]  most of us don't then you got to say how am I contributing to it and if you're
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:38.440]  saying if every other word out of your mouth is Google this or Google that if
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:41.640]  you're whipping out your visa credit card to pay for everything you do if
[02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:45.400]  you're doing all of your purchasing online instead of actually going to real
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:48.680]  stores break and mortar and supporting local businesses if you're going to
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:52.520]  Walmart every time you need to fill your shopping cart then you are basically
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:57.240]  contributing to the problem because doing the status quo taking those default
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:01.600]  settings is adding to the problem and we've got to be in mass and I know
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:04.840]  enough people listen to your program that even if just we did this we'd have a
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:07.760]  massive impact because you know I drive up and down the freeways by the way in
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:11.600]  New Hampshire and I see info wars bumper stickers on the back of random cars I
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:15.840]  mean you are everywhere Alex so if the listeners to this radio program would
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:18.800]  get a clue and say all right here are some things I'm gonna do I'm gonna start
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:23.640]  paying cash I'm gonna start patronizing local locally owned stores even if I
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:25.920]  have to pay more you know everybody always says oh but everything's so cheap
[02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:28.880]  at Walmart I see how cheap is your freedom how much you willing to sell
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:33.040]  that for because I would rather go to a local store and I do this consciously
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:38.560]  and spend an extra 50 cents on a $2 item consciously aware with total
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:42.560]  awareness that I'm spending more and I've viewed I view that 50 cents as me
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:46.440]  putting money to fund the things I believe in and by the way there's so
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:50.440]  much stuff out there a lot of times you can buy stuff at a swap meet or a
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:55.520]  garage sale that's why the headline Fox News last year 15 million dollar fine
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:48:01.280]  for garage sale they are coming the forums ask the question why is there a
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:04.800]  war against lemonade stands because why is there a war against Amish or folks
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:09.360]  selling pecans on the side of the highway because the system this is a
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:14.760]  corporate takeover and they want you under their control is is those little
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:18.320]  sales they may seem a little to us but they're a massive part of the economy
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:21.840]  and those guys want everything you know it's the greed factor I want everything
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:24.760]  you know Google wants all the searches and all the phone calls and all of the
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:27.960]  everything's and you know and by the way I shouldn't single out Google because
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:33.200]  that's kind of not fair it's also Yahoo it is hotmail it is Microsoft and we're
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:36.240]  almost out of time we're almost out of time speaking of that because I want to
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:39.880]  come back to a few calls for you Catherine here's the Daily Mail force to
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:46.640]  stand for 24 hours suicide necks toxin exposure and explosions inside the
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:51.440]  Chinese factories making iPads for Apple I mean that just shows how how
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:55.640]  sickening Apple is now they pose as trendy liberals now speaking of that
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:00.280]  here's Bill Gates and if you go read the ABC News blog the whole thing is
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:04.840]  sponsored and they've got a link there that it's paid for by Bill Gates and
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:08.200]  in the articles I'll tell you how much he loves you when he's on record being a
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:11.720]  eugenicist that says literally kill granny people don't believe that just
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:18.400]  type in Bill Gates you know calls for death panels now look at this he he is
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:23.800]  now bought into Monsanto big time but look at this London Guardian food crisis
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:28.320]  compromises fight against world hunger warns you in report and it goes in
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:32.720]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation they're literally financing the entire news
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.840]  and what said and it's all about how much he wants people to get food but
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:41.040]  then in his real writings and statements he's actually trying to cut the people
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:48.040]  off I mean here's this eugenicist whose dad ran Planned Parenthood financing
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:53.520]  propaganda that's the opposite of what he really does Catherine this the whole
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:57.160]  food thing huh you know it it does come down I mean we can talk information
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:01.000]  control all we want but in the final analysis it comes down to food I mean it
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:04.720]  does it comes as food water and air you know you cut that off and you you will
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:08.520]  have a population very quickly doing whatever you want so when Bill Gates
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:12.320]  starts talking about controlling food I start getting super nervous and and when
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:16.640]  he talks about genetically modifying mosquitoes that's the last thing I need
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:20.360]  is Microsoft you know who can who can barely run an operating system releasing
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:23.040]  a bunch of genetically modified mosquitoes into the environment no thank
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:26.080]  you you know what they can barely run and it's got so many backdoors built into
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:30.640]  its spine you we all think as you point out we're using Google we're using
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:35.480]  Microsoft to you know that's only part of it it's got the back door the whole
[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:39.280]  thing is designed to see what you're doing that's right so yeah and by the
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:44.000]  way speaking of Microsoft Linux is your other opt-out check off the checkbox and
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.880]  get out of the default setting just like start pages for Google that's what
[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:52.960]  Linux is for Microsoft yeah stop using Google we've got to move forward with a
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:57.000]  boycott and I know they own YouTube I'll continue to operate there attacking and
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:00.760]  exposing their globalist takeover program we'll be right back with your

[02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:10.560]  little five-minute extra to make sure I get to most these calls that have been
[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:17.040]  holding but look at this New York Times article the struggle for daily bread the
[02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:23.440]  US government pays farmers to produce less than half the food they could the
[02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:27.680]  same in other countries GMO is all about controlling the food supply and
[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:32.760]  turning it into a genetic bio weapon basically that doesn't produce more
[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:36.840]  seeds that you've got to continue to purchase from the globalist it's the
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:40.600]  computer makers going in and basically genetically manipulating things and
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:45.280]  turning it into their own products so they can create monopolies here's the
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:49.040]  New York Times struggle for daily bread the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:53.920]  now the world's principal private funder of agricultural research this is a guy
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:59.240]  that you know wants to release mosquitoes that carry vaccines to force us to
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:03.160]  take the shots he's into weather weapon funding he's the number one funder of
[02:55:03.160 --> 02:55:07.280]  that I mean he's super creepy and you look at all these other characters that
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:12.360]  are involved they always propagandize about how much they want us to you know
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:16.280]  have all this freedom and how much they love us but meanwhile it's the opposite
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:23.240]  Catherine kind of has that has finally figured it out and again you know our
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:25.920]  parents didn't know that and our grandparents didn't know it they saw
[02:55:25.920 --> 02:55:31.280]  Walter Cronkite on the evening news and it was gospel so that's my point in
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:34.760]  what has changed that and what is created this window for us to know this to
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:37.600]  actually be able to hear what you're saying and understand it believe it and
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:40.600]  understand that it's true and that that is the way the world works this is like
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:44.560]  this is like unprecedented people have always believed the propaganda except for
[02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:49.440]  a tiny teeny little minority and now you've got the majority getting it and
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:52.080]  they get it because of the internet which is why they're scrambling so much to
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:55.160]  shut it down you know Hilary talked about this and so to Brzezinski last year
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:58.280]  that the public's finally awake to him for the quote first time in history and
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:01.680]  they're losing the info war but expanding on that Catherine we're going to start
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:06.040]  jamming in some calls here they miscalculated they always knew there'd
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:09.200]  be people resisting him but they thought they just call us conspiracy
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:13.520]  terrorists now many of us have audiences bigger than their organs and it's
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.600]  freaking them out and they miscalculated they miscalculated folks we're in the
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:22.440]  fight doesn't mean we're winning but we're in the fight we better fight harder
[02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:27.520]  get the word out about info wars calm about alternative media about start page
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:32.040]  calm about it all get the word out today who Leo in Illinois thanks for
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:40.480]  holding welcome yes hello Alex I got a suggestion US state-run media or US
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:45.800]  corporate media seeing how they're all run by corporations multinational
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:51.400]  corporations all admitting that they support so far so it seems perfect just
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:55.360]  like in China and in North Korea their state-run television now they're the
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.360]  they're the monopoly state-run media I mean it turns out most the media so-called
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:04.040]  mainstream media got banker bailout money Catherine remember that oh yeah
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:08.440]  they did and oh yeah it doesn't take much I mean you take a look at like who's
[02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:13.200]  at the Bilderberg conferences as you report on so efficiently and you know
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:16.080]  it's all the media it's it's the mainstream media who's at those events
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:20.520]  you know Google's there they're all there well you know Schmidt was there and
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:25.840]  right after that happened well we got stuff filed on us websites on YouTube
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:30.720]  taken down and got not just delisted from Google News but they lowered our
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:36.680]  search rankings a week after that ouch yeah okay well you got slapped well we
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:40.200]  had reporters there in his face yeah I think they'd like the ability to do
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:45.160]  that to everybody and see that's the thing even it and you know Google started
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:48.480]  off saying don't be evil and Google offers some fantastic products no
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:52.760]  question about it and even if you Google if you trusted them as much as you
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:56.840]  trust your best friend the reality is once everything gets consolidated into a
[02:57:56.840 --> 02:58:00.920]  single it could always be taken over and it has been almost out of time Catherine

[02:59:00.280 --> 02:59:04.080]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:08.960]  Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and
[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:13.760]  they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:19.000]  American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of
[02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:24.080]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and
[02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:28.000]  on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:31.880]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do

[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:36.360]  holding no problem Alex great to be on Michelle love what you do keep doing
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:41.720]  what you're doing I wanted to can you hear me Alex yes sir I wanted to
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:44.680]  mention I was watching Fox News the other night Sarah Palin was being
[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:49.120]  interviewed and the interviewer was talking about Mitt Romney how he was
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:54.680]  the best candidate to go up against Obama and Palin was making a case for
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:58.680]  Newt Gingrich well we all know Newt Gingrich is as corrupt as it comes but
[03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:03.200]  she was making a case for him but as she was talking she said something very
[03:01:03.200 --> 03:01:06.960]  interesting towards the end of the interview she says those pundits who
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:15.280]  are telling them what to do and those elites who want them to obey and listen
[03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:19.960]  to them and want them to shut the race down and just as she said that the
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:25.600]  interviewer completely cut her off so it is just real interesting when you
[03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:28.920]  hear something like that on the mainstream media after you get a kick at
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:35.360]  that one well there are different camps and Gingrich is always been a
[03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:40.040]  Democratic operative and so the reason Republicans are attacking him isn't
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:44.800]  because he's such a globalist so is Romney it's that he's pretty much always
[03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:50.880]  been known this is now coming out as a Democratic Party operative and as a
[03:01:50.880 --> 03:01:55.000]  globalist you know a deep-cover operative and so it's you know the fact
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:00.920]  is Republicans don't like him he's not even a rhino and so that's why they
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:05.440]  can't stand him because he did sabotage a lot of stuff that they wanted back in
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:09.720]  the 80s and 90s while posing as a conservative he's extremely out of
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:14.320]  control I think the elite are scared of him because he is such an ego maniac
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:17.400]  they don't want somebody who might actually try to be president even though
[03:02:17.400 --> 03:02:21.520]  he'd be evil they want somebody who's more of a puppet like Mitt Romney and
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:26.800]  that's my analysis of the situation and in a way that's kind of true I mean I'm
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:30.440]  not saying I like Mitt Romney it just Gingrich is dangerous as I've been
[03:02:30.440 --> 03:02:34.600]  saying for years I mean I mean if the elite are even scared of him I mean he's
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:40.120]  he's a psychopath he's dangerous and so that's why they want a rubber stamp
[03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:43.840]  puppet empty suit like Obama or Romney appreciate the call great points
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:49.480]  mouse link in New York you're on the air so good to speak to you is Catherine
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:54.240]  still on the line she's gone okay I had a couple of questions for her about the
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:59.280]  announcement that Twitter made this week about being able to selectively remove
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:03.720]  tweets based on the country of origin did you yes I guess I covered it's in
[03:03:03.720 --> 03:03:07.640]  the Daily Mail and Associated Press and London Guardian they're just announcing
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:11.560]  they're gonna censor anytime they want any government request if you you know
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:15.000]  if you're in Thailand and say I don't like the taxes are too high boom your
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:18.200]  account's gone not just your tweet they're admitting that they're gonna
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:22.320]  censor Twitter is hooked up with the State Department on record Twitter is a
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:26.040]  globalist operation you know we use it but it doesn't mean it'll be there
[03:03:26.040 --> 03:03:29.600]  forever we use their big platforms to reach people but we know it's it's all
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:34.440]  part of the Internet takeover I agree with you I like Twitter a lot you know
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:39.680]  what I think is that we need to sidestep the official systems of
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:44.000]  communication and create alternative technology and what I wish that
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:47.800]  somebody was talking about don't hear anybody mentioning this idea is that we
[03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:52.720]  could create a peer-to-peer Internet based on existing technologies with you
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:55.520]  know the technology that everybody already has in their home with like their
[03:03:55.520 --> 03:03:59.040]  Wi-Fi or maybe something like Wi-Max I mean I don't understand why we couldn't
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:02.840]  daisy chain like an internet connection through all of our neighbors
[03:04:02.840 --> 03:04:07.960]  stuff stuff like that's gonna happen but the biggest thing is just going to
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:13.240]  other sites that aren't part of the globalist insider ring and fighting for
[03:04:13.240 --> 03:04:16.800]  the freedom of the web pointing out that it's nothing but a monopolistic
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:21.040]  takeover taking place and using the web while we've still got it I mean folks
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:26.440]  please on your Twitter Facebook YouTube plug info wars.com and
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:31.480]  prisonpunna.com there's a reason they're starting more and more to censor us by

[03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:41.680]  have info wars.com forward slash on the road but I'm gonna be speaking in
