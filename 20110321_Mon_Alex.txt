[02:36.580 --> 02:41.740]  Gaddafi so you go in and you attack Gaddafi then you stage terror attacks
[02:41.740 --> 02:46.580]  that legitimize your full bore invasion that's already building up the
[02:46.580 --> 02:53.500]  preparations for off their coast and then it legitimizes your war and allows
[02:53.500 --> 02:57.940]  you to crack down on your real prey the 300 million Americans who you're putting
[02:57.940 --> 03:03.820]  through slave training dog training of taking your shoes and belt off and your

[09:23.180 --> 09:30.940]  and chic and powerful and has majesty to be into remember what the private
[09:30.940 --> 09:37.260]  Gruckheimer in the Ithaca times now nine years ago came back from Afghanistan
[09:37.260 --> 09:41.660]  after his first tour told the paper we go into villages we kill men women and
[09:41.660 --> 09:45.980]  children including toddlers and the Pentagon came out a day later on Fox
[09:45.980 --> 09:51.060]  News and said we want to clarify we only kill everyone in certain villages yes
[09:51.060 --> 09:56.700]  we walk up to newborn babies and shoot them with them 16s they go in and they
[09:56.700 --> 10:03.220]  take children and they line them up and they just shotgun them laughing and the
[10:03.220 --> 10:07.500]  army's own report from Abu Ghraib where they take the children in front of
[10:07.500 --> 10:10.940]  their parents and they get the battery acid and they pour it into their
[10:10.940 --> 10:17.020]  orifices and they engage in satanic death and evil oh all the name of America and
[10:17.020 --> 10:22.300]  then the US government releases the photos to further destroy America's
[10:22.300 --> 10:27.740]  name as part of the endgame and America takes it hook line and sinker like a
[10:27.740 --> 10:32.980]  big bass who's had a purple worm drop down in front of him there's a big
[10:32.980 --> 10:36.100]  Wall Street Journal article today about why do we let him dress that way in
[10:36.100 --> 10:40.100]  fact I forgot to print that print it for me why are 10 11 12 year old girls now
[10:40.100 --> 10:44.460]  dressing as prostitutes as the new style because MTV it came out five years ago
[10:44.460 --> 10:50.340]  had a plan to do that to sexualize the preteens the 20s and parents buy into
[10:50.340 --> 10:55.980]  that death as well it's all engineered for societal death because once they've
[10:55.980 --> 11:01.380]  got your morals once they've got you to become seduced by the dark side you are
[11:01.380 --> 11:07.980]  weak you are blind you are have no discernment and you will fall it is the
[11:07.980 --> 11:13.020]  bill of rights it is constant the Constitution it is the rule of law it is
[11:13.020 --> 11:19.340]  all of those hedges of protection that protect the great jewel of liberty that
[11:19.340 --> 11:24.540]  Thomas Jefferson talked about must be protected at all cost and that jewel of
[11:24.540 --> 11:28.860]  liberty has now been shattered and thrown into a million different pieces and
[11:28.860 --> 11:34.420]  now the shields are falling evil and judgment is flowing in as radiation
[11:34.420 --> 11:38.580]  begins to bathe the United States and the media tells you it's actually good for
[11:38.580 --> 11:47.860]  you and culture and others and as every blessing we had is sucked dry by the
[11:47.860 --> 11:52.860]  vampires the psychic vampires of the New World Order and you walk into the gas
[11:52.860 --> 11:57.380]  station or you walk into the corner bar and they've got the war on not sports
[11:57.380 --> 12:02.660]  and they're high-fiving every time a cruise missile hits actually hurt in the
[12:02.660 --> 12:07.380]  gas station Saturday whoo-hoo high-fiving man the bankers can break

[12:12.060 --> 12:16.620]  try to assassinate some little petty dictator oh they can send the special
[12:16.620 --> 12:22.580]  forces in with al-Qaeda backing the whole operation and everybody can
[12:22.580 --> 12:26.540]  celebrate and have a wonderful time and feel big and powerful I want to show
[12:26.540 --> 12:29.460]  TV viewers a document cam shot before others just go to the London
[12:29.460 --> 12:35.260]  Telegraph the West and al-Qaeda on the same side in Libya statements of
[12:35.260 --> 12:40.180]  support for Libya's revolution by al-Qaeda and the leading Islamist have
[12:40.180 --> 12:44.820]  led to fears that military action by the West might be playing into the hands of
[12:44.820 --> 12:49.820]  its ideological enemies al-Qaeda was created by the CIA and British SAS
[12:49.820 --> 12:53.380]  along with Pakistani and Israeli intelligence on record
[12:53.380 --> 12:57.060]  bozinski's written two books bragging about it they were used as the pretext
[12:57.060 --> 13:01.220]  to invade the Serbs the Muslim extremist attack out of Albania led by
[13:01.220 --> 13:06.740]  Osama bin Laden on record the US and NATO bombed the power plants the water
[13:06.740 --> 13:13.660]  plants the factories for peaceful aircraft and cars they blow Serbia into
[13:13.660 --> 13:18.980]  the Stone Age they bombed all their major cities with DU they roll in with
[13:18.980 --> 13:22.300]  al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda began massive ethnic cleansing of the Serb
[13:22.300 --> 13:28.820]  Christians and our media went whoo-hoo and it was all done off of a hoax all
[13:28.820 --> 13:35.140]  done off of a hoax of a UN facility with one guy that had hepatitis standing
[13:35.140 --> 13:39.060]  trying to get into the food facility and they said that was people in a camp
[13:39.060 --> 13:43.180]  when they were people looking in from the outside it turns out the British
[13:43.180 --> 13:49.380]  News asked the guy to take his shirt off just like Saddam had babies and
[13:49.380 --> 13:52.420]  incubators when they were throwing the babies out of the incubators and
[13:52.420 --> 13:58.900]  the incubators and clubbing their heads now admitted a total lie just like WMD's
[13:58.900 --> 14:09.380]  in Iraq all lies and here it is al-Qaeda pouring out of Saudi Arabia give me a
[14:09.380 --> 14:14.580]  document cam shot please Libya being being overrun by al-Qaeda look at that

[14:23.420 --> 14:28.580]  hyping terror attacks inside the US and that's the big news now in the New
[14:28.580 --> 14:35.820]  York Times today bracing for Qaddafi to hit us with terror he might actually try
[14:35.820 --> 14:41.860]  it but more likely the globalist will simply activate some sleeper cells of
[14:41.860 --> 14:46.260]  useful idiots or actual operatives they'll blow some stuff up and the TSL
[14:46.260 --> 14:50.020]  say see we're putting you in the naked body scanners we're setting up highway
[14:50.020 --> 14:54.380]  checkpoints we've got all local police trained for civil emergency that's the
[14:54.380 --> 14:59.260]  code word buzzword for martial law see we told you and then oh we've got to

[15:43.740 --> 15:47.700]  we're everybody's here on the news that dirty rats gonna try to hit us with an
[15:47.700 --> 15:52.500]  al-Qaeda meanwhile al-Qaeda works for the globalist they get to take over

[25:03.020 --> 25:07.940]  Gaddafi was going up against peaceful crowds went on record it was NATO
[25:07.940 --> 25:15.220]  British French US backed special forces in their commanding al-Qaeda out of
[25:15.220 --> 25:22.860]  Saudi Arabia and Egypt not even debated and now I mean there's al-Qaeda who was
[25:22.860 --> 25:26.860]  used against the Serbs used against the Russians being used again and the public
[25:26.860 --> 25:31.380]  doesn't even put two and two together it's in mainstream news CNN London
[25:31.380 --> 25:36.980]  Telegraph as a footnote going back four years ago and then again two years ago
[25:36.980 --> 25:40.180]  the White House put out public statements saying they were using four
[25:40.180 --> 25:46.300]  rebel groups on the eastern border of Iraq with Persia with Iran to launch
[25:46.300 --> 25:49.500]  attacks in the country and the US special forces were on the ground in
[25:49.500 --> 25:56.900]  Iran acts of war telling us that Iran's gonna launch terror attacks on us this
[25:56.900 --> 26:00.900]  isn't our government this isn't our military your son or daughter maybe in
[26:00.900 --> 26:04.580]  the military maybe a great person it'd be like a nice person who was German in
[26:04.580 --> 26:10.420]  the German military in 1940 okay the country is run by crooks it's not
[26:10.420 --> 26:15.140]  America doing this and we better hit our knees and repent and also publicly say
[26:15.140 --> 26:20.100]  not in our name what's going on yeah Gaddafi's been in power for 41 years he
[26:20.100 --> 26:24.260]  looks like a goofball but he's a strong man who's handed out millions of guns to
[26:24.260 --> 26:28.100]  his people he's preparing for invasion they're clearly got an invasion set
[26:28.100 --> 26:34.220]  their special forces there admittedly for over a month the invasion forces are
[26:34.220 --> 26:39.380]  off the coast and the way they're acting is they may stage a terror attack and
[26:39.380 --> 26:46.020]  blame it on Gaddafi and then legitimize a crackdown domestically and more police
[26:46.020 --> 26:49.420]  state as we go into the depression what did rank corporation say three years
[26:49.420 --> 26:54.780]  ago that Paul Watson wrote about made big national news because we're some of
[26:54.780 --> 26:57.020]  the old people that'll actually read government reports and write about it
[26:57.020 --> 27:00.700]  rank corporation said the next few years to get out of the depression we need a

[33:20.660 --> 33:40.540]  what have we told you in the last few years that the globalist
[33:40.540 --> 33:45.540]  stratagem was that as they build towards the world meltdown of financial
[33:45.540 --> 33:51.140]  markets by design and the public birth of private corporate world government
[33:51.140 --> 33:59.940]  issuing the new global currency the SDR what have we broken down that they would
[33:59.940 --> 34:04.020]  do that what did Webster Tarpley I want to get on the next few days guys go
[34:04.020 --> 34:06.500]  ahead and fact even the last hour to have you get Tarpley I meant to tell you
[34:06.500 --> 34:11.060]  what did Tarpley say the Brzezinski model was he's written countless white
[34:11.060 --> 34:14.980]  papers books he's told us what he would do he's running foreign affairs for
[34:14.980 --> 34:21.780]  Obama for behind the scenes destabilization wars breaking countries up
[34:21.780 --> 34:28.700]  financing rebels and then when the rebels fail you move in behind them in the
[34:28.700 --> 34:32.780]  name of dealing with a humanitarian crisis we have called this a hundred
[34:32.780 --> 34:38.900]  percent what did I say a few weeks ago that they would attack Gaddafi that that
[34:38.900 --> 34:43.100]  was coming and then they would stage terror attacks and say that Gaddafi had
[34:43.100 --> 34:48.540]  done it as a pretext to launch a full bore ground invasion of the entire
[34:48.540 --> 34:53.820]  Middle East every quote enemy rogue nation but also go after the globalist
[34:53.820 --> 34:58.700]  big enemy the Western population said of their milk cows that they're bleeding
[34:58.700 --> 35:04.900]  dry and now the New York Times says US eyes Gaddafi terror response US
[35:04.900 --> 35:07.980]  intelligence agencies are watching for signs that desperate Colonel Neumar
[35:07.980 --> 35:11.860]  Gaddafi under attack from a coalition aerosol could resort to acts of
[35:11.860 --> 35:17.220]  terrorism against Western targets see how perfect this is and then if he fights
[35:17.220 --> 35:21.540]  back it's called terror or if he even if he doesn't they'll stage something they
[35:21.540 --> 35:26.180]  the globalist for years at least five they admit have been trying to get the
[35:26.180 --> 35:31.060]  Iranians by attacking them internally through terror groups to respond this is
[35:31.060 --> 35:35.100]  very sinister US officials are keeping an eye on that possibility one US
[35:35.100 --> 35:42.340]  official said Colonel Gaddafi has extensive stockpiles of mustard gas high
[35:42.340 --> 35:45.940]  explosive at his disposal that could be used in attacks against targets in
[35:45.940 --> 35:49.820]  Europe or against his own people he has also a documented history of
[35:49.820 --> 35:54.140]  orchestrating the strikes against civilians and other world leaders alright
[35:54.140 --> 36:00.940]  now here's the most important point that people need to be made aware of what
[36:00.940 --> 36:07.140]  is the Western ally Bahrain saying that just defeated with Saudi Arabian troops
[36:07.140 --> 36:12.420]  a massive uprisings nationwide many of them violent Bahrain King says forces
[36:12.420 --> 36:18.020]  of foiled foreign plot oh who do you think was behind it Bahrain's King Hamed
[36:18.020 --> 36:23.980]  bin Isil Al Khalifa said a foreign plot against his kingdom had been foiled and
[36:23.980 --> 36:28.820]  thank troops brought in from neighboring countries to help end increasing
[36:28.820 --> 36:33.140]  unrest after weeks of protest and expect but again when he shoots peaceful
[36:33.140 --> 36:37.980]  protesters it's loving and good in our media at least for now will they call
[36:37.980 --> 36:42.780]  for an invasion of Bahrain they didn't call for an invasion of China after
[36:42.780 --> 36:47.820]  Tiananmen Square or the ongoing stuff in the last 20 years the King told forces
[36:47.820 --> 36:53.060]  that such a plot that if such a plot had succeeded in one Gulf country it could
[36:53.060 --> 36:59.060]  spill into neighboring states well of course that's the plan the ferocity of
[36:59.060 --> 37:03.460]  the crackdown last week by Iranian forces aided by the entrance of troops
[37:03.460 --> 37:09.060]  from the Sunni ruled Gulf countries stunned Bahrain's majority Shiites the
[37:09.060 --> 37:14.620]  main force of protest and angered the region's non-Arab Shiite power Iran so
[37:14.620 --> 37:19.220]  they're claiming the trying to imply Iran's the power Iran which supports
[37:19.220 --> 37:23.300]  Shiite groups in Iraq and Lebanon has complained the United Nations and asked
[37:23.300 --> 37:29.820]  neighbors to join in urging Saudi Arabia to withdraw forces from Bahrain now
[37:29.820 --> 37:36.740]  what's going on to the west of there in Syria north of Israel wave of unrest
[37:36.740 --> 37:42.980]  shakes Syria crowds torch headquarters crowds set fire to headquarters of the
[37:42.980 --> 37:49.460]  ruling bath party in Syria and city of Darra on Sunday residents said as a wave
[37:49.460 --> 37:53.780]  of unrest in the Arab world shook even one of the most authoritarian states the
[37:53.780 --> 37:58.580]  demonstrators also set ablaze the main court complex in two phone company
[37:58.580 --> 38:03.780]  branches yeah they know exactly what to hit special force commanded one of the
[38:03.780 --> 38:10.100]  firms is owned by the president Assad's cousin they burned the symbols of
[38:10.100 --> 38:14.300]  oppression and corruption an activist said the banks nearby were torched so
[38:14.300 --> 38:18.540]  you've got all these dictatorships run by independent dictators or run by
[38:18.540 --> 38:22.780]  western-backed dictators and when the western-backed dictators kill people and
[38:22.780 --> 38:29.460]  shoot them it's loving good helpful pro-america but when the but when it's
[38:29.460 --> 38:37.700]  Libya or when it is Syria it's horrible and we've got to invade and when I say
[38:37.700 --> 38:42.100]  we again that's my own brainwashing from the globalist it's not our government
[38:42.100 --> 38:49.060]  it's not our military get that through your heads as we go bankrupt and remember
[38:49.060 --> 38:53.660]  all those Obama memos all those White House advisors saying we need a new 9
[38:53.660 --> 38:58.260]  11 we're new Oklahoma City to blame on domestic groups and a 9-11 to blame on
[38:58.260 --> 39:02.140]  firing groups to keep the wars going and to make Obama's approval rating go up
[39:02.140 --> 39:07.700]  we need these events remember the Giffords shooting within hours they were
[39:07.700 --> 39:13.820]  blaming it on talk radio Ron Paul Alex Jones Rush Limbaugh Sarah Palin as the
[39:13.820 --> 39:20.740]  internet kill switch goes into place all of this happening now all of this
[39:20.740 --> 39:28.260]  unfolding with British and other Western special forces on the ground marking
[39:28.260 --> 39:32.900]  and lazing targets of the ongoing bombardment with Gaddafi handing out
[39:32.900 --> 39:36.780]  over a million weapons to over a million citizens preparing for the ground
[39:36.780 --> 39:41.100]  assault and the globalists are happy to just split off the eastern part of the
[39:41.100 --> 39:45.580]  country and circle Gaddafi and then launch more guerrilla attacks over the
[39:45.580 --> 39:52.460]  years but they may actually stage a terror attack remember in the few months
[39:52.460 --> 39:56.900]  before 9 11 even the Time magazine and Newsweek reported on this the week after
[39:56.900 --> 40:02.460]  9 11 oh 44,000 US troops 18,000 British troops several aircraft carrier

[41:01.100 --> 41:05.820]  Guard is able to play a part in curbing the atrocity the atrocious

[41:40.700 --> 41:48.540]  lies US Army kill team in Afghanistan posed for photos of murdered civilians
[41:48.540 --> 41:54.460]  including children commanders braced for backlash of anti-US sentiment that could
[41:54.460 --> 41:57.940]  be more damaging than Abu Ghraib scandal commanders in Afghanistan are bracing
[41:57.940 --> 42:02.580]  themselves and they've now released the photos we'll put it back on screen looks
[42:02.580 --> 42:06.940]  like about a 12 year old in civilian clothes dead with a US troop feeling
[42:06.940 --> 42:13.980]  really manly right now I mean he shot him and it's fun senior officials at
[42:13.980 --> 42:17.220]  NATO's international security assistance force in Kabul have compared the
[42:17.220 --> 42:21.060]  pictures published by German news week leader Spiegel to the images of US
[42:21.060 --> 42:24.740]  soldiers abusing prisoners in Abu Ghraib in Iraq which sparked ways of anti-US
[42:24.740 --> 42:28.900]  protests notice it was time to pull out of Afghanistan it's like it was time to
[42:28.900 --> 42:35.140]  pull out of Iraq in 2005 and so they release the Abu Ghraib photos they
[42:35.140 --> 42:41.300]  want the rebellion British SAS was caught in 2006 London Guardian
[42:41.300 --> 42:47.260]  Associated Press dressed up like Sunnis shooting and killing Shiites in
[42:47.260 --> 42:55.380]  Basra Iraq this is a multi trillion dollar operation for the bankers they
[42:55.380 --> 42:59.100]  create the entire war they fund the terrorists they fund the criminal groups
[42:59.100 --> 43:04.980]  they fund attacks that's come out on our own troops by mercenaries you got to
[43:04.980 --> 43:10.780]  have some kill numbers they know the troops are gonna have a delayed death
[43:10.780 --> 43:16.660]  from the DU this is full spectrum war against everyone by the globalist
[43:16.660 --> 43:20.980]  playing different tribes different religions different groups off against
[43:20.980 --> 43:28.740]  each other full spectrum dominance get into the mind of the globalist
[43:28.740 --> 43:33.620]  understand oh but the army's apologize so it's okay does that mean Qaddafi can
[43:33.620 --> 43:40.220]  apologize and the invasion won't have to happen and remember they lied and said
[43:40.220 --> 43:43.460]  there was no Western involvement the rebels a month ago in Libya now it
[43:43.460 --> 43:46.900]  turns out the whole thing was run by the West just like the whole thing against
[43:46.900 --> 43:50.060]  Mubarak was run because it turns out he didn't want to go along with the Libyan
[43:50.060 --> 43:59.140]  attack the Iran attack are you guys calling Tarpley he's good for 130
[43:59.140 --> 44:03.180]  excellent job I forgot to tell you I want him good job Tarpley absolutely
[44:03.180 --> 44:10.340]  called this in 2008 during the campaign he said Obama is gonna win this is
[44:10.340 --> 44:13.900]  exactly what's gonna happen they're gonna fund destabilization groups in all
[44:13.900 --> 44:17.580]  the Arab countries and then there's gonna be a giant destabilization in a huge
[44:17.580 --> 44:26.660]  war that could lead to World War three and exactly what he said happened we
[44:26.660 --> 44:30.140]  even in Obama deception show the maps and how they would do it of course
[44:30.140 --> 44:33.420]  Tarpley we could give him credit but and he does deserve it because he actually
[44:33.420 --> 44:36.780]  read with what president Brzezinski said what the Israelis in the 80s talked
[44:36.780 --> 44:40.700]  about a plan did he stabilize all the Arab countries including allies and
[44:40.700 --> 44:46.180]  overthrow them and then have a war with the Al Qaeda they put in that'll make
[44:46.180 --> 44:50.500]  some money for the defense contractors these guys I remember two three years
[44:50.500 --> 44:53.940]  ago it was coming out about black water murdering people for fun and the drugs
[44:53.940 --> 44:58.460]  and the armaments and the reports of staging events as a pretext for the
[44:58.460 --> 45:03.060]  West to stay in those countries people would send me emails or even ran into
[45:03.060 --> 45:06.860]  family who were like black waters pro-america doing what the Marmy can't
[45:06.860 --> 45:14.580]  do family I have in the military and now it turns out all of it was true and
[45:14.580 --> 45:20.260]  they've moved to the Middle East where they can't be extradited and I remember
[45:20.260 --> 45:23.380]  three months ago all these reports about why is black water moving in to
[45:23.380 --> 45:27.620]  North Africa why have they signed a deal with a mercenary group even bigger than
[45:27.620 --> 45:31.500]  them out of South Africa that's so secret details aren't even known about
[45:31.500 --> 45:38.980]  them super hardcore mercs because they knew about the new bonus time coming you
[45:38.980 --> 45:44.260]  better believe there's merc forces not just SAS and other regular military out
[45:44.260 --> 45:50.940]  of England are all over Libya right now and they got their rear-end handed to
[45:50.940 --> 45:57.700]  them by Muammar Gaddafi was actually a military guy he's a bold scrapper folks he
[45:57.700 --> 46:03.020]  took over and he was 20 something years old was he 27 when he took over over
[46:03.020 --> 46:10.420]  through a monarchy and he says I'm going down he says I'm going down I will die
[46:10.420 --> 46:13.780]  here and he said it's lies I haven't left Tripoli remember a month ago and then
[46:13.780 --> 46:17.140]  two weeks ago and then they always keep lying to kind of bolster the rebel
[46:17.140 --> 46:21.340]  forces Gaddafi's fled we won to try to create a mass panic he said I haven't
[46:21.340 --> 46:33.220]  left I will die here bring it bring it well the globalist have brought it and
[46:33.220 --> 46:38.220]  this is what he said to Obama in a statement today to my dear Obama our
[46:38.220 --> 46:43.660]  son saying he's a son of Africa says Gaddafi defending attacks on rebels now
[46:43.660 --> 46:49.220]  he's a son of JPMorgan Chase Goldman Sachs get that straight Gaddafi to my
[46:49.220 --> 46:55.420]  dear son our son says Gaddafi defending attacks on rebels he went on to say if
[46:55.420 --> 46:58.700]  you were having uprisings against your capital what would you do in America
[46:58.700 --> 47:02.060]  well we know even they were legitimate they would mow down citizens and it
[47:02.060 --> 47:06.140]  would be hailed as a wonderful act the feds would then set off truck bombs
[47:06.140 --> 47:10.340]  outside public schools to target children and blame the groups they'd mowed
[47:10.340 --> 47:14.540]  down for bombing the children that's an easy equation if the globalist have to
[47:14.540 --> 47:17.820]  mow Americans down they will simultaneously debt detonate weapons
[47:17.820 --> 47:21.460]  blame in on domestic groups they will then go around and arrest all the
[47:21.460 --> 47:26.460]  patriot leaders including myself don't think that's not what they're moving
[47:26.460 --> 47:31.540]  towards if things get so bad in the depression that you uprise they will
[47:31.540 --> 47:35.740]  commit atrocities and blame it on you it is in the army handbook leaked by
[47:35.740 --> 47:39.580]  WikiLeaks three years ago the army does not deny it's theirs they admit it's
[47:39.580 --> 47:44.460]  theirs teaching army captains and above who are in special ops black ops how to
[47:44.460 --> 47:49.460]  stage terror here's your canteen here's your m16 here's your field manual now
[47:49.460 --> 47:54.420]  here's how you have stage terror attacks it seems to work best when you kill some
[47:54.420 --> 47:59.980]  kids you're a real man aren't you that's why you've moved up to this level don't
[47:59.980 --> 48:02.920]  worry we're gonna have you shipping narcotics into America after a few

[55:44.500 --> 55:50.620]  about their own children this whole new war is a good smokescreen from Fukushima
[55:50.620 --> 55:57.340]  and the ongoing radiation being belched into the air 20 plus times safe
[55:57.340 --> 56:04.180]  radiation levels reported in the food what 26 times in Japan radioactive iodine
[56:04.180 --> 56:11.060]  in the water not hearing about that now more of that coming up the next hour and

[56:26.780 --> 56:34.780]  uprising targeting key installations in Syria right now I the Syrians are
[56:34.780 --> 56:38.900]  corrupt Gaddafi's corrupt but do we have the big corrupt bankers that run us
[56:38.900 --> 56:44.140]  launch wars against them so they can get their oil and get beach heads to take
[56:44.140 --> 56:49.420]  over the rest of the Middle East that we've all got to pay for wrangle is
[56:49.420 --> 56:55.340]  calling again for a national draft that little crook
[56:59.060 --> 57:05.980]  I'm speechless at this point but you've got Gaddafi saying to my dear Obama our
[57:05.980 --> 57:11.300]  son says Gaddafi defending attacks on rebels calling Obama our son leader
[57:11.300 --> 57:15.940]  Muammar Gaddafi sent a message to US president defending his decision to
[57:15.940 --> 57:20.140]  attack the rebels fighting to overthrow him Gaddafi 68 also wrote a letter to
[57:20.140 --> 57:23.660]  French and British leaders in the UN General Assembly saying the Security
[57:23.660 --> 57:27.900]  Council resolution was void and violated the UN Charter warning them that they
[57:27.900 --> 57:32.020]  would regret any intervention that's exactly what they want Gaddafi is for
[57:32.020 --> 57:36.100]  you to launch weapons across the Mediterranean into Europe so they can
[57:36.100 --> 57:41.940]  invade you Libya is not for you Libya is for Libyans he said no it's for the
[57:41.940 --> 57:45.620]  New World Order details of Gaddafi's letters were released by the Libyan
[57:45.620 --> 57:48.780]  government spokesman at a news conference in Tripoli defending his
[57:48.780 --> 57:52.900]  decision to attack rebels Gaddafi told Obama al Qaeda is an armed organization
[57:52.900 --> 58:01.260]  passing through Algeria Mali what would you do if you found them controlling
[58:01.260 --> 58:04.620]  American cities with power and weapons well Gaddafi you know they're running
[58:04.620 --> 58:10.700]  them what would you do so I can follow your example trying to strike a personal
[58:10.700 --> 58:14.540]  note Gaddafi prefaces letter saying to our son his excellency mr. Barakus
[58:14.540 --> 58:19.020]  St. Obama I have said to you before who they've met and hugged that even at
[58:19.020 --> 58:23.060]  Libyan the United States of America enter into war God forbid you always
[58:23.060 --> 58:28.620]  remain our son your picture will not be changed in his letter to Nicholas

[58:31.740 --> 58:36.060]  Libyans for Libyans the Security Council the revolution is void because it is

[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:26.700]  Alex Jones Wayne med since joining us to break down the Fukushima reactor the
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:31.740]  situation in Libya Syria Bahrain the Bahrainian government saying it's a
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:38.340]  foreign-backed attempted overthrow of their country this new UN precedent is
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:43.860]  Western-backed rebels with special forces commanding and predominantly out of
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:48.540]  England attack a country and the country fights back against rebels now a
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:54.140]  bombardment and no flies on an invasion is reportedly triggered and that
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:59.060]  precedent is now being set now remember here's the most important thing I've
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:04.060]  said today I must say it again the globalist need a war to create
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:09.380]  artificial patriotic fervor to go along with the debasing of the currency the
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.580]  robbing of the pension funds economic martial law being declared in Michigan
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:18.180]  and other states regular laws being phased out and suspended they won't call
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:23.860]  it martial law internet kill switches open calls for censorship of the
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:29.700]  internet all of this now being done by design they need a war what has
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.060]  tarply told you what have I told you what has dr. Roberts told you what is
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:40.300]  every other serious political mind told you the next playbook is war all over
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:47.900]  the world and airstrikes going in to back up the rebels attempted assassination
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.220]  of Gaddafi which violates federal and international law the resolution does
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:56.460]  not say it's a death penalty you know I guess they kill slow them a lot of it
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:01.420]  never let him have a trial after they had al-qaeda attack the Serbs and al-qaeda
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.260]  is there doing the same thing and he doesn't get a judge jury executioner
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:08.340]  there can't be a trial where the facts come out not the Gaddafi's good but
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:11.660]  everything that's been said to lie so they want a killing with cruise missiles
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:16.740]  and 2,000 pound bombs and they're trying right now they've got drones up
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:20.940]  there they've got on the ground spies they're trying to target him there's
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:24.580]  big secret bounties on his head you better believe and they're out to
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:30.420]  killing so they can roll in put al-qaeda in charge and then turn around and slap
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:36.900]  them down and that'll give the bomb makers a place to drop bombs now I want
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.980]  to continue with a total recap of all the latest developments in the Middle
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.340]  East and North Africa on the other side but also want to take some of your phone
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:51.780]  calls on these issues the toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:03:01.740]  800-259-9231 and while we're busy focused on this while we're busy
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:07.820]  covering these issues while we're busy focused on what's happening in North
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:14.220]  Africa the radiation cloud from the explosions last week is headed this way
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:18.540]  the headlines are intensifying radiation all over Japan and that's
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:22.260]  basically on the back burner now and our media the controlled corporate media
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:26.300]  saying all increased radiation levels are no big deal because it's been
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:30.420]  diluted across the Pacific so you do a general background radiation meter it's
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:37.020]  only up a little because it's the little particles individually unless one of
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:41.060]  those sticks on the front of a Geiger counter it doesn't go up much but if you
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:45.180]  breathe it and then it sits there in your lungs that's what all the nuclear
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.860]  physicists and medical doctors and radiologists experts have explained
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:54.740]  that's why it's dangerous that's why Chernobyl was dangerous and that's why
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:04:01.380]  the cancers are going up one of the cocktail of reasons that all of that is
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:06.180]  now happening as well but I do want to take your phone calls will you guys
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:13.620]  launch my messenger to Minnesota so I get those thank you 1-800-259-9231 I
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:17.540]  have been exhausted lately because I've been thinking about this so intensely
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:21.740]  and realizing that you notice just everything is going crazy now the
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:26.260]  globalists have flipped a switch and the haywire has begun because they're
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:30.380]  transitioning into this global government model this private corporate
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:36.460]  global governance model and it's on and the globalists are moving against all
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:42.500]  of our liberties all of our freedoms in a big way the federal juries convicted
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:46.580]  the Liberty dollar creator totally legal what he did according to every law
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:52.340]  Ron Paul said that you've got North Carolina Montana moving for their own

[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:12.460]  the GCN radio network Dr. Webster Tarble is going to be joining us last 30
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.940]  minutes of the next hour coming up in about 25 minutes we've got Wayne
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:20.260]  Madsen formally with the NSA give us his take on what's happening internationally
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:24.980]  I want to recap and get into some of the latest news in North Africa with Libya
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:27.780]  and the new war that's been launched there then I want to get into the latest
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:33.100]  on the Fukushima Japan ongoing meltdown then I'm going to your phone
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:38.980]  calls Jack in Japan Mark Marshall Tim Ben and others that are patiently holding
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:43.460]  here's the most important information even London Telegraph reporting it is
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:48.460]  al-Qaeda that's been launching the attacks SAS backed British special forces
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:53.020]  backed the entire month-long attack they got defeated so now the West is
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.060]  publicly bombarding and trying to assassinate Qaddafi that violates
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:01.580]  international law I know at a bestial level people feel powerful this is not
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.700]  our military this is the global government's military doing this here's
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.300]  the present planet article breaking it down US government backs Libyan al-Qaeda
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:13.980]  while hyping terror attacks inside the United States and that's really the
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:18.140]  biggest news is they're saying look for Qaddafi to strike it would serve the
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.740]  globalist to stage terror attacks now I'd say we're in prime danger of it
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:25.660]  happening not a hundred percent they're gauging right now to stage terror
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:30.580]  attacks then blame it on Qaddafi use that as a pretext to launch the amphibious
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:36.260]  invasion with the Marine Corps and NATO UN backed invasion ships right off the
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:43.140]  coast of Tripoli right now and they get to then crack down on the American
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:50.580]  people and take more liberties in Yemen in Bahrain those are Western allies
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:55.900]  they're having massive riots and the military is cracking down on people in
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:01.860]  the globalist enemy state rogue state of Syria the quote protesters are hitting
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.300]  key government buildings and telecommunications infrastructure and
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.620]  are we going to hear a new UN resolution that an invasion has to now
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:14.980]  happen in Syria because they're abusing their population they're abusing the
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.700]  globalist special forces that are attacking and murdering people meanwhile
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:23.020]  US Army kill team in Afghanistan poses for photos of murdered civilians
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:29.020]  including children this is the type of stuff that's going on this is the type
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:33.540]  of stuff that's unfolding will we be invaded undoubtedly someday when the
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:37.260]  Southwest gets lit on fire by the illegal alien Ford Foundation controlled
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:41.740]  groups yeah there's been open talk about using a UN stabilization force and
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:46.020]  using Mexican and Canadian troops in the US during civil insurrection that's
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:52.180]  now mainstream news Ottawa citizen associated press they've been planning
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:58.140]  this a long time in leo 9 in leo 10 FEMA drilling with 14 foreign nations to
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:02.660]  take over the US don't think it won't happen here don't think this global
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:07.340]  government precedent isn't being set with the UN last Thursday ordering the
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:12.620]  West to start the no-fly which is double speak for bombardment and physical
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:19.340]  ground invasion this is unbelievable what's going on but it's part of the
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:23.940]  strategy of tension predicted by myself and other experts here years ago this
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:28.820]  is the brazigni brazinski david Rockefeller global strategy of
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:37.260]  destabilization there is so much to break down here
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:42.500]  France is collapsing France 24 reports that's what Le Pen is saying we're
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:46.580]  going to be going over that as well let me shift gears into Fukushima here are
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:51.460]  the headlines info wars dot com Japan's nuclear crisis debacle and the
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:56.340]  depopulation agenda Fox News is still rolling footage of the plant before it
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:01.580]  blew up to make you think it's undamaged pounding rain fuels radiation fears in
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:06.700]  Japan driving rain on Monday disrupted rescue efforts in Japan and compounded
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:10.300]  the misery of disaster survivors now facing radioactive fallout from the
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:15.780]  smoldering wreck of the nuclear plant you mean plants they're now picking up
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:21.660]  up to 26 times health regular doses of radiation and spinach other food and
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:29.660]  water supplies as far away as Tokyo 150 miles away meanwhile you've got days
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:33.820]  and days over a week of radiation blowing our way with no actual readings
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:37.380]  coming out the federal government and UN saying well they're above normal but
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:41.900]  that's that's not bad for you with again the background radiation is one thing
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:46.940]  it's the individualized fallout particles themselves higher that they're
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:50.420]  picking up from a distance with the Geiger counters you breathe that you
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:55.220]  get on your fingers you rub your eyes one particle is enough to accelerate your
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:13:00.140]  cancer risk massively but we're seeing the cover-up we saw with your noble
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:03.940]  three-mile island hey it's no big deal in fact in Ann Coulter Fox News we
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:07.380]  actually have these clips if you think I'm joking just type in Ann Coulter says
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:11.020]  radiation good fact folks won't believe that pull up the clip it's from an
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.860]  article Friday I go to YouTube and culture says radiation good for it's a
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:19.180]  short clip will play later soon as you find it pounding rain fuels radiation
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:24.020]  fears in Japan workers flee Japan nuclear plant as smoke rises yet again today
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:28.020]  you're being told by the media predominantly on the big nightly news
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.900]  oh it's cleaned up problems getting better they may have to chair no bullet
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.180]  and actually cover it with sand and concrete yeah it's smoking and still on
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:40.420]  fire but don't worry about it 600,000 plus fit fuel rods six reactors forum of
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:47.060]  blown up everything's fine workers flee Japan nuclear plant is smoke rises
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:51.900]  radiation rising gray smoke rose from two nuclear units today temporarily
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.740]  stalling critical work to reconnect power lines and restore cooling systems
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:59.500]  that's to stabilize Japan's radiation leaking nuclear complex they dump
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.860]  seawater into all of the gums up the systems there's been huge explosions
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:06.980]  don't count on that power getting it back on I'm just being a realist workers
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:10.540]  are racing to bring the nuclear plant or control but the process is proceeding
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:14.380]  and fits and starts stalled by incidents like the smoke and by the need to work
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:18.180]  methodically to make sure wiring pumps another machinery can be safely switched
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.660]  on our crisis is still going on our crisis is with the nuclear plants we're
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:29.060]  doing everything we can to bring this to an end Governor Yuhei Satou of Fukushima
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:36.540]  prefecture where the plan is located told the more than 1,000 people moved away
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.860]  from the plant into a gymnasium don't give up we know you are suffering please
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:46.820]  get us out of here yelled a 63 year old Japanese truck driver what caused the
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:51.020]  smoke to bellow first from unit 3 at Fukushima Daiichi plant and later from
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:55.620]  unit 2 is still under investigation yeah right they admit partial meltdowns of
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.980]  four of the plants explosions to reactor cores breached 600,000 plus fuel rods
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:05.300]  blown hither and there nuclear safety agency official said still in the day
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:09.700]  since March 11th earthquake the tsunami racked the plant's cooling system both
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:13.300]  reactors have overheated and seen explosions four of them have workers
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.940]  were evacuated from the area to buildings nearby through radiation levels
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.700]  remain steady the official said that's a nice way to spend higher levels they're
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:26.500]  steady problems set off by disasters have ranged the head of the plant said
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:30.420]  last Friday that it was it's enough to kill you started crying couldn't be part
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:34.420]  of the cover-up anymore problems set off from the disasters have ravaged and
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:40.500]  rage far beyond the devastated northeast coast and wreaked nuclear plant
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:44.340]  handing the government what is been called Japan's worst crisis since
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:49.540]  World War two man I'm exhausted folks I know you are too imagine the people
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:53.500]  in there trying to secure those plants so they don't have total meltdown which
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.980]  may have even happened we don't know the truth cover-ups are admitted we just
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:02.460]  don't know the extent imagine them risking their lives just watching this
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:05.980]  just reporting on it is exhausting
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:14.580]  US makes potassium iodine available in Japan now we know why the government's
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.500]  been hoarding it because they're shipping it Japan makes sense Taiwan
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:25.180]  Japanese restaurant offers radiation checks for diners Japanese government
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:29.180]  admits potassium iodine pills should have been distributed earlier it's
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.860]  always something good to have in your medicine cabinet Japan radiation release
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:39.140]  long-term problem France's ASN says the release of radiation from the crippled
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:43.340]  Fukushima die as you nuclear power plant will be a problem for Japan to
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:46.660]  years to come what about us directly in the line of the fallout according to
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:50.420]  French nuclear watchdog we are at the beginning of the post-accident phase
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:57.260]  André Claude Lacoste head of the Paris based nuclear watchdog group set at a
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:01.420]  press conference in Paris today Japan will have to deal with the consequence of
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:05.700]  this accident Japan will have to deal with the consequences of this accident
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:09.540]  for decades radioactive contamination which has been significant could spread
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:14.100]  as far as a hundred kilometers around the site he said are already has said
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:24.980]  Japan's chief cabinet secretary and they're saying radiation levels 26 times
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:32.060]  normal levels found on spinach and in the water and other food is safe tell
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:37.060]  that to folks that get cancer Jack in Japan what can you tell us Jack well
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:40.220]  basically Alex the first thing I've got to let you know I'm not sure I haven't
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:44.500]  I haven't heard you report on the set if you have in today's episode I apologize
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.340]  but the first thing I want to let you know is that in our drinking water we've
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:54.460]  now got dangerous levels of radioactive iodine 131 and cesium 137 in the
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:59.940]  prefectures of Fukushima, Ibaraki, Guma, Tochigi and in diminished levels but
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:04.300]  even in Tokyo yes sir we did report that last night today but I should have
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:08.500]  reported it more in fact we'll put on screen just search the term radioactive
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:12.580]  iodine found in Japanese drinking water and food as well as some other isotubes
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:19.900]  in one prefecture 26 times safe levels that's correct that's correct and I
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:23.380]  got a message for Ann Coulter if she thinks radiation is so nutritious then
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:27.700]  I'll either pay for her airfare to come out here or I'll brew up a pot of coffee
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:33.180]  with my cesium 137 water and I'll ship it to her well that's a good point to
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:38.420]  make we should publicly challenge Ann Coulter in fact I'm publicly saying that
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:44.020]  I will pay for her a first-class ticket to Tokyo from wherever she lives in fact
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:48.100]  I want to get Watson or Aaron Dykes or Kurt I want to put the challenge out at
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:53.700]  infowars.com to Ann Coulter right now that I will pay for her a first-class
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:58.300]  ticket room and board to go to Fukushima and I'm sure they'll let her
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:02.820]  tour the reactors themselves if it's so good I think she should go drink water
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:07.660]  directly from the reactor course oh and Alex I will drive her up there
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.780]  personally I was disgusted when I heard those comments I swear to goodness and
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:14.660]  one more note of concern you are correct the work at the reactors was
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:20.740]  suspended at 355 local time today due to fires in the reactor cores and one of
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:24.980]  the reactors is the number three reactor that's the dangerous mox reactor and
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:29.940]  according to my research we've got something on the order of 1,760 tons
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:36.740]  of you know live and spent fuel on site and you compare that to Chernobyl with
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:41.740]  180 tons and this this thing is pretty serious if you ask me tell what stay
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:44.620]  there Jack your intel is absolutely on target from all our research I want to
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:48.420]  get more from you on the other side than Mark Marshall Tim Ben and others I'm
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:53.660]  Alex Jones this is the Genesis Network GCN live.com there is no doubt but
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:56.940]  there's an ongoing cover-up about the disaster in Japan they're using the new
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:59.740]  war as a distraction
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:06.580]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:12.100]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.780]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have a tremendous
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:20.860]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:26.220]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:31.140]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:35.540]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:39.260]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists they're asking for more
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:43.220]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today seems
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:48.860]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:54.860]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or

[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:13.980]  Congressman Ron Paul said about Cha-ching Wisdom 123 practical universal

[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:21.540]  certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money,
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:25.300]  your investments but it also can be generalized into the nation. What's
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:28.260]  going on as a nation? We do these same things as personally that we do as a
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:32.260]  nation. Dr. Berry's book Cha-ching Wisdom presents many facets of your
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:36.140]  relationship with the once-almighty dollar and how current national and
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.860]  international politics affect your daily life. Some of the other things are
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:44.060]  about that. They're not just economic, they're philosophical, there's psychology
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:47.620]  involved in this book, there's philosophy involved in this book. Read Cha-ching Wisdom

[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:06.380]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:10.220]  the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:13.940]  become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds that all perform even
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.180]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:21.300]  again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:26.700]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:30.940]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:34.700]  part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:38.820]  actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:44.020]  today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a

[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:58.300]  crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for

[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:18.820]  We're putting our money where Ann Coulter's mouth is. CurtinMO at InfoWars.com
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:27.540]  right now is writing the story at Headline. We will pay Ann Coulter to go to Fukushima
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:32.220]  Radiation Zone. And we're going to state it for, okay, lady, you say radiation is
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:35.900]  good for and there's a growing body of evidence. They target certain cancers
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:40.260]  with it because it kills cells, not the entire body being hit by it. Every major
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:44.820]  study shows it increases cancer. No one denies that. But this is their brazen
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:51.180]  propaganda. Not only is the radiation in the U.S. not bad, it's good for you. Yes,
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.700]  it's very good for the atomic soldiers. It was very good for the folks at
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:57.940]  Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's very good for plant workers that have inhaled
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:01.900]  uranium and plutonium, even the folks that mine it when it's not enriched die
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:07.700]  from it. Incredible. Jack, I mean, talk about brazen propaganda. That's certainly
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:12.500]  it. Jack from Japan. Anything else you'd like to add? Well, basically, you know, I
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:15.860]  had a meeting with several people today and basically everybody knows that the
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:20.300]  government is lying to us and everyone is getting very, very angry. Not just at
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.380]  the government, but at the Tokyo Power and Electric Company. Everybody knows
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:27.700]  just the basic design of these reactors. I mean, why would you put something
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:33.820]  that's dangerous, fissile, and can't explode on top of something that can
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:37.180]  explode? In other words, I'm sure as your listeners know, they've got the
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.860]  spanned fuel rods and the grooves of these reactors. And so it's like, why would I
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:45.540]  store my gasoline on top of my, you know, on top of my pile of, you know,
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:51.260]  fireworks? No, no, on top of your stove. Exactly, exactly. And and the people
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:54.700]  are just really starting to get wise quick. And some of the good news is some
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:57.540]  of the local level government people, as you mentioned, the mayor of the one
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:01.300]  particular town and the governor Fukushima, they're getting wise quick too.
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.980]  And I'll tell you what, people are getting really angry. And I am definitely
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.900]  going down to Tokyo Power and Electric in Tokyo to to talk to some managers and
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.500]  I'm going to film it and do a little weird change. So Guerrero filming, you know,
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.940]  when I get the chance, one more thing I want to add, Alex, get this, they
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:20.820]  haven't even closed the schools. Okay. The kids are walking 20, 30 minutes,
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:24.220]  going to schools. They're playing outdoors for an hour during recess,
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:27.620]  especially right about now, because the school year changes over in April here
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:32.300]  in Japan. It's, it's, uh, what is it? September? No, I saw that in the news.
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:36.060]  That's just like 9 11 with all the asbestos dust. They've got to say,
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:39.380]  don't wear masks. They've got to keep the schools open, or they'd have to
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:40.580]  admit that there was a problem.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:44.980]  Exactly. Exactly. And so it's just everything's fine. Just go back to
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:49.380]  sleep. No problem. Send your kids to school. Meanwhile, it's raining and
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:53.500]  they're playing outside. And we've still got here where I'm at. The
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:57.220]  radiation has gone down a little bit. It's only about six times the normal
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:01.820]  amount of radio radiation, but, but in other parts, a little bit closer. Um,
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:06.260]  it's, it's really bad. Like an Ibaraki prefecture and in the Tochi prefecture
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.340]  and Fukushima prefecture. Again, that's, and that's an error reading, not the
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:15.940]  spinach, not the water where it's dissipated and, and, and, uh, basically
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:21.100]  condensed and had a chance to bioaccumulate. Exactly. And you better
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:24.260]  believe when they started taking the spinach off the shelves, a lot of the
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:28.060]  people that I know, including just, you know, little grandmas and grandpas
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:32.580]  who don't even really, uh, follow, you know, the news too well, they really
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:35.860]  started to wake up when they saw this, you know, one, one of the thing Alex, I
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:39.780]  wanted to, uh, to share with, uh, with you, with your listeners. It's just you've
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:42.900]  mentioned it before on your show. And I just want to say it's true here, you
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:47.220]  know, spread this information out because people might chuckle at you right
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:50.340]  now. They might not believe you right now, but when this stuff starts coming
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:53.180]  true later, they are really going to start listening to you and believe me,
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:56.580]  the people who, you know, listen to me, but didn't buy any storeable food or
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:00.780]  water. Um, they are, that's the group of people who came to me today to have a
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:03.820]  meeting at my house to talk to me about what we should do about this situation
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:07.900]  because they, they understood that, you know, this, this information is real.
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:11.700]  And, um, and if you do do things that if you do get prepared, if you do look
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:15.620]  towards the future, um, and not necessarily trust every single thing that comes
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:18.300]  out of the government mouthpiece and rather trust things that come out of the
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.780]  alternative media, um, you can be better prepared when a situation like this
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:27.100]  comes down to play. Very well said, Jack, from Japan. Anything else you'd like to
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:32.700]  add? Oh, just that, just let me tell you, um, people really are living on pins
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:37.980]  and needles here. I mean, I've got, I used to live in Fukushima, Alex. I look
[01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:42.780]  at the pictures of, uh, of like Iwaki in Fukushima and I recognize the streets
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:46.700]  and now they're just torn to shreds. Um, another place that has been really
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:50.020]  damaged are the graveyards and graveyards are really important because
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:53.460]  it's like your whole family history goes into one single grave. All right.
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:57.060]  For, and so for hundreds of years for one single grave, it's all your
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:00.460]  grandparents and great grandparents and everything. And now it's just smashed.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:04.940]  Um, and so people are just really pretty much just living day to day. And
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.740]  it's really, it's, it's a sad situation. And just people, people out there and
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:12.580]  listeners and everybody just pray for Japan. Um, just pray for us if you can.
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:16.340]  And I appreciate it. We will, Jack. Thank you so much for the call. I will get
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:21.540]  to Mark Marshall, Tim, Ben and others while Wayne Madsen is live on air with
[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:25.140]  us. We're gonna look more into Fukushima with him, but also, uh, what's
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:31.620]  happening in North Africa in this new war, the UN launched this. This is the
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:38.100]  purest UN war ever. Congress had nothing to even say. Uh, this was the United
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:42.820]  Nations basically calling the shots as Obama said, another big step for
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:47.860]  globalism. Anytime there's a protest in a country now, there's any police
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:54.340]  brutality. Look for us to invade. We're on the march. The empires on the run.
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:58.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:04.740]  Diamond Gussett is proud to announce the anthem of the patriot movement.

[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:29.220]  tomorrow.
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:34.980]  I'm looking for America.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:40.580]  Wear American and be proud. Go to gussett.com forward slash America.

[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:52.900]  gone. Long gone.
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:31:01.860]  But I know in my heart it's still. Again, go to gussett.com forward slash America today.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:06.180]  Alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages
[01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:10.180]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide. We're seeing the impact right
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:13.780]  here in the United States. Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum
[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:18.820]  use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February and pump prices are expected
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:22.980]  to reach $5 a gallon. Because of shipping costs, food is being
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:27.460]  priced out of the reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:30.980]  the next 60 days. Move quickly while you can still afford it.
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:34.980]  And eFoodsDirect will pay your shipping cost for you. For the best tasting,

[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:08.420]  tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:12.020]  has become reality. It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:15.860]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:19.620]  police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:24.420]  existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:28.020]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:32.020]  established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:34.580]  sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:38.900]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:42.100]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:46.020]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:50.260]  of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:51.700]  Thank you so much for joining us today. We are halfway
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:55.780]  into this worldwide broadcast. We just talked to Japan
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:59.140]  to a caller in Japan, Jack. We're going to continue with your phone calls
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:02.420]  throughout this hour into the next in the last 30 months of the next hour.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:08.900]  Webster Griffin tarply joins us. Words cannot describe how hypocritical and
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:14.740]  ridiculous it is that the West, the big banks,
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:20.980]  the military industrial complex that runs our country
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:24.900]  claimed a month ago that they didn't have any special forces in Libya
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:31.060]  and that they weren't involved in the destabilization program.
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:34.260]  Now it's been admitted for at least three weeks that British special forces and
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:38.580]  other mercenaries, not just regular government
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:41.940]  SAS, special air services, are in the country leading the
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:47.620]  groups and that yes it is quote the CIA al-Qaeda brigade
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:53.780]  out of Saudi Arabia and Egypt and it's in the London telegraph
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:57.220]  CNN they go oh is it wrong that al-Qaeda is hailing this
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:01.220]  and then al-Qaeda is doing it maybe not al-Qaeda was good when they attacked
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:05.380]  Serbia as a pretext to start that war oh look the Serbs are being mean to the
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:09.860]  al-Qaeda we've got to invade and hand it over to Albania basically
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:14.020]  oh they used al-Qaeda to attack and start the war with the Russians
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:18.020]  is that saying the Russians were little angels no the point is the globalists
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:23.940]  are starting these wars and now they've tried to assassinate
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.820]  Qaddafi in the last 24 hours with cruise missiles and bombs
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:32.100]  that's confirmed by BBC and others that's a violation of international law no
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:36.900]  judge no jury no execution the no fly zone doesn't say they can try to kill
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:41.140]  Qaddafi notice Hillary and others have said you
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:45.780]  will accept a humanitarian force that's a ground force
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:50.980]  or we will completely destroy you so this is a new war and it's part of this
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:56.500]  larger strategy of tension and we have the UN with its
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:01.300]  ruling with its resolution Thursday ordering this launch and calling a no
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:05.780]  fly zone but in the body is the language for aerial bombardments that are now on
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:09.380]  and physical invasion with two Marine Corps giant amphibious
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:12.980]  invasion ships or basically Marine Corps
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:17.860]  ground invasion command carriers they're like stub carriers
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:22.260]  they're about a little 60 percent the size of a regular
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:26.820]  carrier the Navy has you can pull them up if you want online
[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:30.340]  their names are in the news are similar to the Coronado but it's not there
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:33.460]  that was the Coronado I watched do a drill of landing in
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:36.820]  the Bay Area of Oakland in San Francisco and disgorging
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:40.980]  US Marines and foreign troops with role players screaming I'm an American please
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:45.220]  know not the camp don't take my gun that was a big wake-up call for me
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:49.700]  in 1999 it's in my film police state 2000 by the way
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:54.260]  now Wayne Madsen is a Washington DC base investigative journalist author and
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:57.300]  syndicated columnist he's written for the village voice the progressive
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:02.340]  counterpunch online journal corp watch multinational monitor news insider
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:06.420]  these times the American conservative his columns have appeared the Miami
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:09.220]  Herald Houston Chronicle Philadelphia Inquirer Columbus dispatch
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:12.020]  sacrament will be the Atlanta Journal Constitution among others
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.900]  he's been all over international television formally with the NSA
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:19.380]  before that in submarine warfare anti-submarine warfare
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:22.900]  also worked for rca corporation he reports from Capitol Hill the National
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:25.940]  Press Club Wayne Madsen report comms the website
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:30.740]  we're linked to it on info wars comm Wayne looking at this it's quite a
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:34.260]  precedent we now have clearly special forces backed
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:37.700]  hitting key targets government buildings telecommunications in
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:43.060]  Syria the new president said that if sovereign governments
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:48.100]  repel western backed rebels that there will then be a western invasion is
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:50.580]  this the these are big new brazilian ski
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:54.100]  destabilization program that he wrote about three years ago
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:58.740]  well i i'll tell you i think what what we're seeing playing out in libya now
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:02.660]  also probably in yemen is the co-option of these
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:08.900]  arab revolts by the cia and their allied intelligence and special
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:13.860]  forces units in these nato countries um
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:17.620]  no one would doubt that what happened in tunisia probably surprised a lot of
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.220]  people that's then spread to egypt and it was
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:24.900]  clear that uh... it was bounded uh... the spill over the
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:28.820]  uh... egyptian and tunisian border in the libya it's spread into algeria
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:33.140]  morocco uh... at saudi arabia and bob rain and other
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.100]  countries but now what we're seeing play out is
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:40.900]  and nato uh... launching this attack on libya now this is
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:47.380]  this is a game changer uh... many in the uh... libyan opposition did not want
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:51.700]  uh... u s uh... and nato uh...
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:55.860]  forces uh... in the country but i think that there's probably
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:00.740]  now two uh... types of uh... two forms of libyan opposition
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:04.020]  there are those who are libyan nationalists who just want to see qaddafi
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:06.980]  go and then there's the others who have been waiting in the wings
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:11.540]  in london in washington and other places waiting for this moment and these are
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:14.180]  the groups that are probably going to
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:18.180]  want to take over with the cia and mi6's support
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:21.860]  uh... and what we're going to see is uh... libya's
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:26.740]  uh... tremendous oil uh... deposits being the target
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:31.540]  uh... for these uh... countries and now that said
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:35.300]  i think we also have to look at there's a huge split with the nato and the european
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:38.740]  union and uh... that we probably haven't seen a
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:42.260]  split like this in nato since the nineteen fifty six
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:48.020]  invasion by britain and france of suez and uh... of course president eisenhower
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:51.860]  would not support that and that created a major rip the nato
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:57.220]  now we see turkey and germany uh... two large nato countries after the united
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:01.300]  states as far as military powers concern not supporting this effort
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:04.580]  and the worst thing the italians are now involved in
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:07.380]  that is the former colonial power that ruled
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:10.340]  libya and i can't think of anything worse than having
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:14.500]  italians to participate in a uh... military
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:18.100]  adventure against libya that nato musilini
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:21.060]  uh... actually uh... invaded for those that don't know
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:24.180]  now they'll say he's a good guy but for for for those that don't know
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:29.860]  this will clearly now unify more libyans behind mua mark adafi
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:33.940]  right and we have of course uh... musilini's ideological son
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:37.460]  silvio burlesconi now in uh... in power
[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:40.500]  in in italy and of course he's facing all kinds of
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:44.820]  uh... legal problems uh... messing around with hooker underage hookers and
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:49.460]  uh... the guys mafiosi from the word go but he's looking at this obviously as a
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:54.740]  chance for him to gain political points he was basically almost on his way out
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:41:00.020]  and now we see harper in canada providing uh... military forces for this
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:04.180]  uh... an invasion of libya and that they're saying that his poll numbers
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:08.980]  are up in in canada so i'm looking at people like sarcosi and burlesconi and
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:11.940]  harper trying to make political points in this and
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:15.300]  now we had saif al-islam qaddafi uh...
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:19.140]  uh... qaddafi's son state that sarcosi's
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:23.540]  presidential campaign was bankrolled by libyan money now that brings up the
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:26.420]  whole thing with the clear stream uh...
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:30.180]  uh... bank accounts uh... uh... sarcosi being funded from
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:33.860]  uh... money outside of france and uh... he went after
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:39.220]  dominique david parent tried to put him in jail for first slander uh... and now
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:43.060]  it looks like probably uh... what the field pan and the others in the shura
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:46.340]  government was saying about sarcosi was true this guy
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:49.860]  was the first guy to run to qaddafi and meet him in libya
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:54.260]  and now he's the first one to launch uh... french war planes against libya so
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:59.620]  we also have the e you had hermond von rupe just a few months ago embracing
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:03.780]  qaddafi you have the british government uh... embracing him
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:08.260]  uh... selling him most of his weapons is this an attempt to go ahead and kill
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:12.820]  qaddafi so that he won't use all of his blackmail on them
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:17.060]  well i think so he's obviously got uh... you know a lot of information about
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:19.540]  uh... what's been going on behind the scenes
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:23.620]  uh... just like saddam who say he had a lot of information about some of
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:26.420]  some of these uh... leaders of these western countries
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:31.140]  and uh... and obviously the the launch of the cruise the tomahawk that hit
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:35.380]  his compound in triply where i was actually was in october two thousand
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:40.020]  nine there's a monument there to the reagan attack against qaddafi where
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:43.300]  his daughter was killed in nineteen eighty six and
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:47.380]  and uh... that's a violation of executive order one two three three three
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:51.300]  which prohibits uh... the assassination of foreign leaders of course
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:56.020]  we've violated that so many times over the years
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:43:00.900]  uh... with the you know the insane uh... and uh... and and and and there's been
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:03.940]  other covert operations against other world leaders
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:08.180]  that haven't gotten as much publicity uh... over the years but uh...
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:12.820]  and now we see a group in congress that democrats and republicans
[01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:17.300]  saying look obama went to the u n he went to nato but he never went to congress
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:21.620]  to get authorization for this act action and uh... there's one democrat
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:24.100]  apparently who's uh... apparently uh...
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:27.940]  uh... willing to uh... put forward uh... articles of impeachment against
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:29.380]  president obama
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:32.580]  wayne madson let let me stop you right there because that's the big issue i've
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:33.540]  been making
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:40.260]  since last thursday no statements no even resolution much less a uh...
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:43.380]  declaration of war which we haven't had since world war two
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:48.100]  now we're seeing nothing from congress within twenty four hours
[01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:53.940]  of the u n voting for a no fly zone it turns into a bombardment
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:58.020]  with british news reporting that sas smash squads
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:01.700]  are on the ground in libya to mark targets for coalition jets
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:04.980]  uh... the rebels arrested a bunch of sas as you know
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:09.460]  two weeks ago that embarrassed everybody uh... clearly they waited
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:13.460]  till the rebels uh... were backed up in a corner so that they would have to
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:14.420]  accept
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:19.620]  uh... western intervention uh... what's the larger strategy in all of this why
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:21.140]  do you think this came together
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:25.780]  so fast as it play into the trillion dollar nuke industry
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:29.380]  desperately needing a distraction from the radioactive clouds still drifting
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:31.060]  this way
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:34.740]  oh wow hasn't been interesting the last couple of weeks with the way the news
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:36.740]  cycle is gone first we had
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:40.020]  a massive coverage of the arab revolt then we had the
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:44.580]  earthquake tsunami and the nuclear uh... disaster in japan and now we're back
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.540]  to libya so uh... you know it's it
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:51.540]  that the news media the corporate media uh... only goes for the news of the day
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.220]  and then other major
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:57.140]  uh... news events are are not covered and and i think we're seeing a lot of that
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:01.300]  play out now it's the news du jour as i call it here in washington
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:06.260]  uh... so yeah i think that plays a lot uh... into this a lot that
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:10.180]  uh... the focus uh... is is moving away from other issues as you said
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:14.660]  the nuclear uh... meltdown at fukushima uh... being and being a major uh...
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:18.340]  that story that's uh... that not only being suppressed by
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:22.900]  the japanese government media tepco but also i think we see a lot of the nuke
[01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:28.340]  industry here the nuke lobby uh... of trying to play down the uh... the
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:32.820]  the safety effects of that so so i think that a lot of these this this news is
[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:37.380]  intertwined uh... and and and that the the gatekeepers the corporate news
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:40.980]  gatekeepers are trying to have it their own way and how
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:44.180]  they report these uh... these breaking stories
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:48.260]  when i want to get more into the unfolding crisis still having trouble
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:53.620]  getting those reactors under control more gas explosions more off-gassing
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:57.140]  unfolding today japanese still talking about a
[01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:01.460]  a uh... chernobyl option of just burying the reactors i want to get into
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:03.860]  and culture saying radiation is good for you
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:07.460]  that's the actual headline but before we go there
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:12.660]  uh... why do you think obama went with this
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:15.860]  to strengthen global governance to strengthen the corporate
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:19.460]  state through the u n to totally cut congress out of the loop
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:24.740]  what's the constellation the cocktail of reasons that they engaged in this
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:29.220]  naked uh... act you know lying and saying he'd race to venezuela he gone as
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:32.980]  in bob way saying he strafed crowds turns out that isn't true
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:35.540]  i mean the point is i'm not saying kadoff he's a good guy it's just that they've
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:40.260]  been lying about him and now we have giant marine corps and navy
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:44.660]  amphibious invasion carriers off the coast
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:49.540]  uh... and the resolution hillary's also said this that if he doesn't accept
[01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:53.460]  a humanitarian ground force that means an armed force
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:57.380]  that there will be an invasion so they pretty much stated the ground invasion
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:00.740]  right there we've got kadoff he handing out over a million firearms
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:05.860]  preparing to uh... for guerrilla warfare right and i think what this shows is
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:08.580]  so bomb is no different than his predecessor
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:12.580]  when it comes to these coalition uh... coalitions of the willing that we saw
[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:16.260]  this play out in iraq we saw put play out in afghanistan
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.500]  and and here we see it playing out again
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:23.780]  um... look uh... there were no vetoes in the u n security council but it was to
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:28.660]  establish a no-fly zone on now we even have the arab league that supported
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:31.540]  uh... no-fly zone saying wait a minute we weren't talking about launching
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:34.980]  cruise missiles and killing civilians which we have many reports
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:38.900]  now that many civilians were killed by these nato strikes on libya
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:42.900]  so they parade out a couple of countries uh... few at air force planes from
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:46.340]  katar in the united arab Emirates big deal we don't see
[01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:49.620]  where's egypt in this whole uh... operation
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:55.300]  um... so yeah it's it's it's obama is a neocon his advisors are neocons
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:58.660]  they can call himself a democrat till the cows come home
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:03.460]  but the foreign policy of obama is no different than the foreign policy of
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:07.140]  george w bush what about this precedent what about this precedent
[01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:10.100]  wane we got limited time here i i hopefully stay a
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:13.140]  little bit in the next hour swing take calls sure but
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:16.580]  what about the precedent being said here where anytime
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:21.380]  there's an uprising in a country and if the nation crushes them in any way
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:25.060]  then there's got to be a u n ordered invasion
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:28.260]  but then there's the hypocrisy of the west crushing
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.620]  and killing demonstrators this has happened in england at g twenty
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:35.140]  and other events there's the specter of cops shooting people in the back
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:39.140]  uh... there's the specter of uh... you know the similar things
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:42.660]  on the heels of the hypocrisy energized
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:46.740]  the illustration energized and highlighted by u s army kill team in
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:50.100]  afghanistan posed for photos of murdered civilians
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:54.660]  including a little bloody dead children with the quote kill teams
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:57.780]  as private gruckheimer first revealed eight years ago that they're ordered to
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:02.900]  go into villages and kill babies and everyone
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:07.380]  yeah i mean it's just ridiculous see you look at that you look at what's going
[01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:09.700]  on in the middle east north africa right now
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:14.260]  okay uh... the president of algeria brutally put down demonstrations in
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:17.380]  algears but he's a good friend of sarcosian
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:21.140]  in france he's a good friend of ours we're not seeing no fly zones established
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:25.060]  over algeria for example uh... we now have several
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:28.660]  yemeni generals many of whom were part of this regime in yemen
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:32.820]  corrupt as all get out now saying oh we're with the opposition that looks to
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:35.700]  me like the cia is trying to also co-opt
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:40.180]  uh... the yemeni uh... revolution just like they did the libyan revolution
[01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:44.260]  and uh... obviously they want uh... president salah gone just like they
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:49.380]  wanted kadafi gone this is an attempt by the cia to basically take over
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:53.300]  uh... the revolutions where they see fit and in places like Bahrain with those
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:57.060]  poor people now uh... that are going into hospitals
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:50:00.820]  and shooting people who are being treated in hospitals in Bahrain
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:05.300]  blowing up the the pearl square monument because it was seen as a
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:09.860]  uh... sort of a rallying point for the opposition but Bahrain is a host of
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:14.580]  u.s. naval base uh... uh... we don't see any no fly zone being put
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:18.180]  over Bahrain and where's the no fly zone over israel so they
[01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:20.980]  they stop uh... attacking a defenseless
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:24.900]  palestinians and gaza in the west bank we don't see any no fly zone there this is
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:28.340]  very selective uh... this is this is a typical
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:33.620]  neocon operation well since when is a no fly zone british special forces backing
[01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:38.420]  al-qaeda rebels uh... well it was just like iraq and
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:43.060]  uh... under under clinton uh... no fly zone over iraq and we had all kinds of
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:46.660]  uh... special forces going in uh... penetrating the border through the
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:51.700]  Kurdish uh... no fly zone area that gets that i'm who's saying this is the same
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.820]  uh... playbook being used all over again
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:58.660]  what's the end game we'll talk about that straight ahead why are they doing this
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:03.220]  then fukushima then your calls when met hi this is alex jones did you know that
[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:06.740]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:10.020]  vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:13.140]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:16.500]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:18.740]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:22.500]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:26.260]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank

[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:10.820]  prisonplanet.tv Wayne getting back to Tripoli
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:14.580]  and getting back to this new UN precedent where the UN gives an order
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:18.020]  and NATO and America jumps obviously because it's their puppet
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:21.060]  they created to have this illusion of international
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:23.620]  solidarity but it's the security council doing this
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:28.500]  not outside nations uh you know the 160 plus that aren't part
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:32.020]  of the security council but having those those
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:36.180]  those ground invasion ships those amphibious delivery systems off the
[01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:40.580]  coast with tens of thousands of troops having Hilary say
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:45.220]  and Obama say you will submit to us you will allow an international aid force
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:49.380]  and which means the military or else uh they're basically gearing up for an
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:53.300]  invasion a ground invasion do you disagree with that
[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:57.060]  well obviously that if there is if they've got these troops ships off the
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:56:01.300]  coast with marines um that that's a real contingency that they're
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:05.220]  considering and and uh it seems like even secretary defense
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:08.900]  gates may have been overruled on this believe that or not i mean he's a
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:11.780]  holdover from the bush administration but he was
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:17.700]  never too keen on this operation uh i think he of all people know how
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:20.740]  thin us forces are spread right now we're
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:25.300]  in afghanistan we're in iraq we've got this covert war in pakistan we've been
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:30.580]  involved with yemen and now libya and i i would also note that the very
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:34.500]  interesting interview was given by general westley clark now i'm
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:38.100]  certainly no big fan it has especially after what he did to yugoslavia
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:42.980]  former yugoslavia but he said that after 9 11 he met a colleague
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:47.220]  in the pentagon who said uh listen we're we're gonna invade iraq he said what do
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:51.220]  you mean iraq what what what's going on he said well there's a plan that we're
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:54.340]  going to go into iraq we're going to go into syria we're
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:57.700]  going to go into libya and there was a couple other countries and
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:01.380]  eventually we're going to go into iraq and so it seems like
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:07.140]  whoever this guy was who told clark this uh was on the money also and and
[01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:11.620]  we see obama just carrying out this same plan that was hatched
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:17.940]  by the neocons under george w bush you're absolutely on target again wane
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:21.700]  and under this new precedent if people rebel
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:26.340]  then the west invades that's pointed right at iran
[01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:30.660]  oh i think iran is and and i think what's happening now in Bahrain where you
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:35.540]  have a large majority syria population you had the king of Bahrain now try to
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:40.340]  justify his bloody crackdown on the opposition by saying well
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:43.940]  iran was involved he didn't say he said uh outside
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:47.700]  parties well we know he's talking about uh and they had the salty
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:51.780]  troops coming across the causeway bridge into uh Bahrain and
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:56.020]  and and just there's videos of them just shooting people at point blank range
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:58:01.060]  just like that that infamous photo of that south vietnamese police
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:06.020]  often uh high ranking officer shooting that uh suspected vietcong in the head
[01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:09.860]  we have videos coming out of Bahrain where's the no-fly zone over Bahrain
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:14.580]  we don't hear hillary clinton talking about that or barack obama barack obama
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:18.500]  was in brazil as these uh this military action was launched brazil
[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:23.620]  voted against uh well they they basically uh abstained um
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:27.700]  in the security council on this on this resolution all right lane we got a break
[01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:30.980]  stay there when we come back we're to start taking calls but then later
[01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:34.420]  in the next 20 minutes i'm going to bring up the biggest issue yet
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:37.860]  they're saying qaddafi's probably going to launch terror attacks will the
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:42.660]  globalist launch a false flag legitimize the war

[02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:22.980]  network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:26.740]  it is monday thank you for joining us more on the on
[02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:30.340]  going unfolding crisis at fukushima that's still
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:34.740]  intensifying but the media is trying to make everybody forget about it
[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:40.020]  by focusing on libya the daily males reporting kernel kodafi sun killed and
[02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:43.220]  commas caused the pilot attack on triply barracks
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:46.340]  but we don't know if any of that's true because so much just information is put
[02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:52.100]  out as war propaganda by the british like kodafi racing to
[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:55.940]  venezuela or running to zimbabwe or being killed
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:59.620]  and we've heard it all but it is certainly intensifying
[02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:04.500]  also the report talks about rebel fighters finding any kodafi supporters
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:08.340]  tying their hands and killing them but that's humanitarian and good
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:12.260]  wane madson is our guest we're going to get into the big issue after the break
[02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:19.620]  before we go to more calls dealing with us i's terror response by kodafi perfect
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:23.940]  to legitimize the war perfect to have domestic crackdowns
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:27.060]  perfect to get approval ratings up we'll talk to wane about that coming up but
[02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:31.140]  right now calls for wane madson who joins us via video skype from dc
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:35.700]  mark in oregon you're on the air hello alex and wane
[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:39.860]  i um would like to make a very short statement then get your comments if you
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:44.420]  would please give them um we're at a point now where it's not humanly
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:48.740]  possible to back this evil down that's my firm opinion i believe that even more
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:53.060]  so because god himself has said the god of creation has said
[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:57.460]  that without him we can do nothing and do you believe that there's any way
[02:01:57.460 --> 02:02:02.500]  outside of relying upon god through a sincere repentance for our national
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:06.260]  no mark i agree with you we've got to change our hearts and then god will
[02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:10.500]  lift us up his vessels to expose evil that's why the globalists sell us on
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:14.100]  torture and corruption because they know it makes us morally
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:18.100]  weak i appreciate your call comments on that wane madson
[02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:22.500]  well i'll tell you you know can anything be done saturday i was at an anti-war
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:26.180]  demonstration at lafayette park across from the white house and this is what i
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:32.340]  saw it uh the first time i saw all this in
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:36.900]  washington i know under bush had happened in other uh... locations they arrested
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:41.780]  him for not having a permit second they did and they kettled and the cops kettled
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:46.260]  everyone into a fenced in area and if you didn't get out of that area like i did
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:49.860]  you were subject to arrest in a five hundred dollar fine at daniel elsberg
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:53.460]  was one of them they some people knew they were going to be arrested but
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:57.380]  uh... they used the mounted police when the mounted horses
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:02.660]  kettled everyone into this fenced in area and and and the tourists and the
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:06.980]  uh... there was a couple pro uh... and anti-caddafi protesters all those people
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:11.140]  nine of them nine eleven truth was there uh... all of those people
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:14.820]  uh... if they stayed in the kettled in area they risked arrest so everybody
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:18.900]  was forced to leave who didn't want to be arrested i did not see that kind of
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:22.820]  activity under bush but i saw it under obama so
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:27.940]  uh... in it when it comes to exercising your your your uh... uh... free speech
[02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:32.100]  rights your freedom of assembly it does not apply
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:34.980]  at at lafayette square and it crossed my mind uh...
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:38.340]  they crossed my mind what what i don't think they want to have happened
[02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:42.660]  on pennsylvania avenue in lafayette park is a terrier square and this was a
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:46.260]  clear indication if we ever tried to have a terrier square in
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:50.180]  washington in front of the white house it would be put down
[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:53.700]  you know it would be put down uh... as fast as anything
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:57.940]  will lead us so that was that was my next point is that
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:03.060]  no protest zones you can't protest in the park in land of the free home of the
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:05.540]  brave but then egypt
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:09.540]  allowed the protest to go on and that was evil and horrible because they didn't
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:13.540]  have the government over the mob because the west wanted it
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:18.100]  i mean this is an illustration of the tyrants that run our country
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:21.940]  well absolutely uh... and you know if i remember under both
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:27.380]  wish we had uh... probably between two hundred and fifty and three hundred
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:30.980]  thousand anti-war demonstrators at several
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:33.860]  these days when i got a stop your skype is is
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:37.300]  unintelligible we're gonna try to reconnect we may just go to phone
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:40.100]  when wayne madson it's great technology be able to have him with us here on
[02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:44.100]  prism planet dot tv and streaming all the radio stations but we're gonna
[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:47.460]  fiddle with that during the break or maybe go audio only over his skype
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:52.180]  try to fix that break up and then we'll continue with jim ben jb ronnie
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:55.140]  uh... and others that are patiently holding
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:59.620]  will also get more on wayne's take on the whole fukushima unfolding cover up
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:03.220]  now out of sight out of mind this is alex jones with five good reasons you
[02:05:03.220 --> 02:05:07.060]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:09.940]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:14.180]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:17.780]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:21.300]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:24.980]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:27.940]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:31.780]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:34.980]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:38.900]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:42.740]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in

[02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:09.140]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide
[02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:12.500]  we're seeing the impact right here in the united states ethanol that was
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:15.300]  supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:19.700]  hit a 30 month high in february and pump prices are expected to reach five

[02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:25.300]  and now live from austin texas alex jones we've been talking
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:29.780]  about all the different facets of the globalist destabilization program
[02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:33.140]  in the middle east with investigative journalists formerly with the national
[02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:37.860]  security agency lane madson
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:41.620]  and we're gonna go to your phone calls here in a moment and segue
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:45.380]  and get his take on the fukushima unfolding crisis that's
[02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:49.780]  worsening right now the press reports show but it's it's not the big news item
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:52.580]  now because everybody loves a new war it's so
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:56.020]  entertaining and makes a lot of men out there feel good about
[02:08:56.020 --> 02:08:59.620]  themselves through the new world order that controls our country and that is
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:02.980]  bankrupting us there's a lot of high-fiving a lot of people are
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:06.420]  watching it at bars and they're not watching sports right now
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:10.260]  they're very very excited and feeling powerful through this mass murder
[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:13.860]  they're also celebrating and feeling very proud about photos of us kill
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:16.740]  teams with dead children that they pose with
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:21.380]  this is our journey into evil very sick to see america turned into a
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:24.740]  instrument of the globalist but this london telegraph article came out
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:27.700]  sunday we also wrote about it before they did i'm proud of that fact
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:32.260]  us government backs libyan al qaeda while hyping terror attacks inside us
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:36.660]  and here's one telegraph the west and al qaeda on the same side
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:42.020]  cnn also ran a similar headline but the big issue came out today and they're
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:46.740]  certainly pushing this now wane us eyes could doffy
[02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:50.580]  terror response and if they have indeed killed one of his sons
[02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:54.500]  as they killed his daughter decades ago he might actually do something
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:58.420]  which then allows them to in the minds of people how dare him fight back that's
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:02.660]  terror then launch a ground invasion that's why
[02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:06.180]  they're so arrogant and in full of bravado right now in my view
[02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:10.100]  and the white house memos talk about how great a terror attack would be
[02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:14.820]  to boost overall police state approval ratings for the tsa who's on the ropes
[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:19.620]  the federal police state the spy grid i see it in the cards for them to stage a
[02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:23.380]  false flag or allow it to take place to try to bolster
[02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:28.820]  uh... their uh... their their expanded takeover wane madson your take on that
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:31.620]  well i think it's it's hogwash uh... say
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:34.580]  uh... and could not be was linked uh... uh... to some
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:38.100]  terrorist groups but we're talking about the nineteen eighties and of course
[02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:42.180]  he was that he was the uh... bad guy du jour in those days
[02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:47.220]  um... um... linked to the irish republican army and the boss terrorist
[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:50.980]  but he he gave all these networks up uh... in
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:54.260]  return for uh... having this uh...
[02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:57.540]  uh... the new deal with these western countries so
[02:10:57.540 --> 02:11:01.460]  i think the the idea that kandafi who's basically got it enough to worry about
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:05.780]  inside libya could uh... you know uh... somehow call
[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:09.220]  up these old uh... cells uh... from the nineteen eighties
[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:13.780]  and seventies is just ridiculous it's more neocon propaganda about the issue
[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:18.580]  of the neocon staging a terror attack as an excuse to ground invade and to
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:22.180]  crack down domestically well i think that's always a fear from
[02:11:22.180 --> 02:11:25.700]  the neocons i mean that's that's how they operate that that that's a
[02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:29.300]  modus operandi we've seen it time and time again and
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:33.860]  in so many of these false flag attacks uh... so that the mere thought that
[02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:36.500]  they're uh... saying well kandafi may
[02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:40.820]  uh... go the terrorist route i think is uh... trying to lay the groundwork for
[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:44.260]  that uh... distinct possibility that we may see something
[02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:48.020]  happen in europe or the united states more more likely it would happen in
[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:52.340]  europe and more likely it would happen in one of the countries that was not keen
[02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:56.820]  on getting involved in this adventure and that that would be germany turkey and
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:12:00.740]  and a few other nato countries who just didn't want any part of this
[02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:04.660]  exactly and folks it's been declassified that our criminal government stages
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:07.380]  terror attacks on a routine basis that is a fact
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:10.660]  one of the chief ones gulf of tonkin to get us into vietnam
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:14.820]  let's talk to tim in washington no no marshall in texas is first
[02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:17.860]  marshall in texas you're on the air
[02:12:17.860 --> 02:12:21.300]  gentlemen i just want to bring up but you spoke earlier on the show when you
[02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:25.060]  thought both of libya uh... that they were going on the under the guide
[02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:29.380]  humanitarianism this might set the president for them to do so here under
[02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:33.700]  unrest whether it be the government creating the unrest and coming down on
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:37.220]  us or whether it be just set the president that they need to be the
[02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:40.500]  ones coming in so that this doesn't happen
[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:43.460]  well we saw what happened yesterday in lafayette park
[02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:47.140]  peaceful pro-war and anti-war protesters
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:51.860]  kettled and arrested in mass no protest allowed in america
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:56.020]  uh... the very tyranny they're decrying in libya wane madson
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:13:00.340]  well absolutely and you know that talk about you know going into a country
[02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:02.980]  under the guise of humanitarian assistance remember
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:06.020]  when george h.w. bush was a lame duck president
[02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:10.980]  at the end of nineteen ninety-two he went into somalia supposedly
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:15.220]  uh... for humanitarian purposes and then when bill clinton became president he
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:17.940]  decides he's going to start to do nation building which
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:22.580]  we saw eighteen u.s. army rangers that killed in mogadishu
[02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:27.140]  as a result of that that that entirely messed up operation
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:30.660]  now we've been there before we went into haiti
[02:13:30.660 --> 02:13:34.180]  i don't know how many times quote unquote for humanitarian missions it isn't
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:38.900]  funny obama obama he had no problem with baby doc going back to haiti but he
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:41.780]  he he didn't want the rightful president who was
[02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:46.340]  ousted in the u.s. coup uh... uh... jambotry ariste returning
[02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:50.580]  from exile imposed by the united states in france and south africa
[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:55.300]  and so it's so we have the humanitarian you look u.s. agency for
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:59.060]  international development which is the the big humanitarian
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:03.140]  organization is nothing more than a cia front has been for a long time
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:06.900]  and we know whose mom dear old mom worked for them for many years and that
[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:12.340]  was salient dunham obama sitoro you know whatever how many names she had but
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:16.820]  thank you marshal uh... uh... i want to go to tim ben
[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:20.580]  uh... and jb and others here and then we'll keep you the bottom of the hour
[02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:23.540]  before our next guest is i want to spend that next little five minutes segment
[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:26.900]  on the reactor continual meltdown that's happening
[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:31.140]  but in your gut wayne watching this for a long time reporting from capitol hill
[02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:34.660]  calling a lot of things before they happen in your gut
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:37.700]  how do you see this ending what are the different scenarios and what do you
[02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:40.180]  think most probable among them
[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:42.660]  well i think what we're going to see is a
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:46.980]  uh... is uh... u.s. uh... military u.s. british french and
[02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:51.780]  some italian military uh... involvement in this what is essentially now civil
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:54.580]  war in libya i think we're going to see a
[02:14:54.580 --> 02:15:01.300]  uh... pro uh... u.s. western government installed at least in vanghazi
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:04.820]  uh... i don't know how long i could not be can hold on
[02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:08.740]  uh... the reports that he had mercenaries uh... from other countries
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:13.380]  uh... in in libya but uh... if if this goes to a full
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:19.220]  full uh... scale uh... military uh... occupation invasion uh... i think uh
[02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:21.140]  but could i be just can hold
[02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:24.340]  hold out that much longer uh... he's got uh...
[02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:28.900]  basically triply and and now the rebels are moving to reclaim some of the city's
[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:32.980]  forces took uh... in the last uh... couple of weeks
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:36.340]  so basically the globalist back forces started losing
[02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:39.620]  and so the big air power came in to back them
[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:43.300]  yeah and i think they've got a lot of vomit chalabi you know he's a guy
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:47.300]  uh... we put in a rock uh... sort of an international con artist and
[02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:51.140]  and crook uh... we've got a lot of libyans who have lived outside of libya
[02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:55.220]  for a number of years in london and washington and elsewhere i think
[02:15:55.220 --> 02:15:58.660]  we're probably going to see an attempt to put one of those characters uh...
[02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:03.780]  in charge in libya and he'll be uh... every bit in in our court is uh... that
[02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:05.860]  puppet guy we have in iraq right now
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:08.900]  a lot and of course iraq's now one of the only arab countries actually
[02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:12.500]  endorsing this the arab league and its support has fallen apart they were all
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:15.700]  for a no-fly zone but not for the bombardment
[02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:20.180]  and the special forces uh... there on the ground but i do see them trying to
[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:24.420]  at least break the country in two from the east and then continue to launch
[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:28.340]  attacks from the east camera and the british prime minister has basically
[02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:32.340]  echoed that saying that the bombardment is all that's going to be happening
[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:35.540]  and that the libyans better quote decide this for themselves
[02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:38.980]  so they're telling the rebels it's up to you now
[02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:42.740]  right well i think the rebels probably now that we've
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:46.660]  changed the game with the tomahawk cruise missile isn't it nice
[02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:51.620]  the united states likes to use standoff weapons at first because
[02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:55.700]  uh... you know it's easy to push a button and kill 50 people on the other
[02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:59.700]  end of that that tomahawk cruise missile but eventually i think we're going to
[02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:03.060]  see some of our ground troops they're probably already there we don't know
[02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:06.820]  about it yet and uh... as you mentioned uh... that the heinous
[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:10.260]  crimes being committed in places like afghanistan against
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:14.020]  civilians were we're probably seeing that already happened in libya
[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:17.780]  except it's not being reported jim in washington you're on the air with wine
[02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:19.300]  madson
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:22.900]  hey how's it going alex i had a couple points for you real fast and uh... i was
[02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:26.420]  just kind of curious on my math here because according to my math that
[02:17:26.420 --> 02:17:29.940]  chernobyl meltdown for 10 days with all the reactors
[02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:34.180]  compiled we're looking at total of 32 chernobyl days
[02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:39.300]  so far in fukushima uh... due to its uh... rate of most of the physicists and
[02:17:39.300 --> 02:17:43.940]  doctors we've had on have said that this is bigger than chernobyl
[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:47.380]  and that there's been a whole bunch of us for reactors with partial meltdowns
[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:50.660]  600 000 plus spent fuel rods sprayed everywhere
[02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:52.980]  wane what's your take on this
[02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:57.380]  well i think that obviously we know that uh... just like with that chernobyl
[02:17:57.380 --> 02:18:01.540]  and three-mile island what we're getting is being downplayed by the
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:05.940]  uh... politicians than the nuclear the very powerful nuclear power industry
[02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:10.500]  this is a very very powerful lobby because unlike other
[02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:14.100]  energy lobbies they have to deal with the government to get the nuclear
[02:18:14.100 --> 02:18:16.500]  material to start these plans so there's
[02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:21.220]  there's already a too close of a relationship between the industry and the government
[02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:25.220]  uh... i i think basically what i'm hearing from people in japan
[02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:28.900]  uh... it is much worse of course
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:33.380]  uh... the japanese broadcaster n h k is run by the government and we're in and
[02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:36.420]  they've been downplaying a lot of this also
[02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:39.860]  uh... but uh... the private media is telling me
[02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:46.020]  uh... that is much worse we're talking about the tokyo metropolitan region tokyo
[02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:50.180]  yokohama people are now leaving the swiss embassy has moved the embassy from
[02:18:50.180 --> 02:18:53.540]  tokyo to osaka so has the u.s military what does that
[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:57.460]  tell you about how serious this really is that it's very serious and they're
[02:18:57.460 --> 02:19:00.820]  telling us the fallouts no big deal on the west coast when the real
[02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:03.460]  radiation hasn't even gotten here yet
[02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:06.100]  well and we've had our politicians tell us that
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:09.220]  three mile island nineteen seventy nine governor thornburg
[02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:14.020]  uh... of pennsylvania stated uh... he said there's no problem he waited three
[02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:18.100]  days before telling pregnant women around three mile island and it's time
[02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:20.660]  for you to evacuate when he knew how bad it was
[02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:24.260]  three days prior so we've seen his play out so many times
[02:19:24.260 --> 02:19:27.700]  chair noble to cover up by the soviet government help lead to their
[02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:31.460]  demise because they covered that up but at any time we see these
[02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:35.860]  reactor incidents and well now we know tepco was fudging on the safety
[02:19:35.860 --> 02:19:40.820]  inspections because tepco is going to stay there government oversight
[02:19:40.820 --> 02:19:44.180]  yes they were going to come right back to that job you have anything else to add
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:47.780]  jam in washington yes i got a couple other things if you don't mind
[02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:51.460]  yes stay there jam straight ahead we'll try to cram in a few others

[02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:26.820]  here's the headline at info wars dot com it just went live
[02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:31.140]  let's send amculture to fukushima i was going to play the clip but we're almost
[02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:35.940]  out of time and they play it later and tease tarply a big nuclear power fan
[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:39.460]  but human events has the headline a glowing report
[02:24:39.460 --> 02:24:43.940]  on radiation by amculture anyone exposed excess radiation
[02:24:43.940 --> 02:24:48.580]  for the nuclear power plants is now probably much less likely to get cancer
[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:52.180]  that's i guess her her thought is you aim it directly to cancer it hurts that
[02:24:52.180 --> 02:24:55.540]  cell that group of abnormal cells but general
[02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:59.620]  radiation the whole body in every major study is i mean that's not even debated
[02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:03.220]  massively increases cancer i mean even our own government estimates a million
[02:25:03.220 --> 02:25:06.340]  deaths in the 25 years associated with
[02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:10.340]  Chernobyl but i mean this is just brazen propaganda saying
[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:15.300]  the radiation is good for you wane madson well you know and culture have
[02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:19.540]  you noticed she hasn't really been on the news recently so she had to say he
[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:23.140]  is she he whatever that is i had to say something
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:28.340]  to get back into the news cycle and the more outrageous of course that's how
[02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:32.260]  that's what the fox news is all about the more outrageous the better
[02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:34.980]  well i don't like i don't like to interrupt the time we've got i don't
[02:25:34.980 --> 02:25:37.620]  like to be mean about how somebody looks because i mean i'm not the most
[02:25:37.620 --> 02:25:42.580]  beautiful person on the planet but at the 2004 republican convention i was
[02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:46.340]  going in the front entrance and waiting for some people and saw her walking in
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:51.540]  and i was actually scared yeah i mean i don't know i'm not joking i was repulsed
[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:55.540]  because she's so anorexic you don't see it on tv because it adds weight
[02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:58.980]  that she could she was having trouble walking and she looked at concentration
[02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:03.060]  camp victim like a like a skull with skin on it painted with lipstick
[02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:08.900]  and she was actually toddling in like a undead no i'm i was like uh i mean my
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:11.940]  actual yeah i've never run into anybody that made me go
[02:26:11.940 --> 02:26:17.540]  it actually take a breath in yeah well i i i maybe that's because she's so
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:21.140]  emaciated that's we think that's an adam's apple maybe or thorax i don't
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:26.100]  know but uh uh the the the the the iron larynx
[02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:30.260]  but i i just don't uh i understand people
[02:26:30.260 --> 02:26:33.940]  you know that the broadcaster is supposed to serve the common interest the
[02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:38.500]  public good and that's definitely not that doesn't serve any public good
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:42.820]  but one thing i'm hearing from people in japan is it's it's no good to send money
[02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:45.700]  because they have money they can't buy anything with it so
[02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:50.420]  what they have nothing off the shelves now in tokyo and yokohama
[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:54.340]  uh the ramen noodles so if anybody has friends family
[02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:58.340]  colleagues over there this is you know small packages so it's not held up in
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:02.580]  customs uh those ramen noodles powdered milk
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:06.020]  triple a double a batteries this is what they're out of and this is what
[02:27:06.020 --> 02:27:10.900]  they're they're in this is now this is the third largest economy
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:14.740]  in the world they just in china of course just surpassed them as the second
[02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:18.020]  largest but this is what can happen to an infrastructure
[02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:21.220]  when they have a triple disaster like they've experienced
[02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:26.660]  in closing wane um give us your summation of how bad the disaster really is the
[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:30.500]  radiation cover-up and the fact that they're saying this is going for weeks
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:34.100]  or months uh headlines about the relief not going
[02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:38.820]  well reactor still smoking burning hundreds of thousands of fuel rods
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:43.700]  uh and uh it seems to be now kind of just going out of the news
[02:27:43.700 --> 02:27:47.940]  well this is what i understand that the chief cabinet secretary adama
[02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:52.660]  uh he cut his teeth politically as an anti-nuclear activist so
[02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:55.780]  what i'm hearing is that there are people in tepco and the
[02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:59.540]  uh a nuclear oversight agency who don't want to tell him a lot
[02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:02.900]  of what's going on because they're afraid he's going to amplify it and make it
[02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:06.100]  sound much of you all is worse than what they're saying
[02:28:06.100 --> 02:28:10.100]  but they don't necessarily trust him and that's why he's not getting the full
[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:13.540]  picture and he's the public face of the japanese government
[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:16.740]  at all these news conferences so there is a willful
[02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:21.620]  attempt by the tepco and the nuclear oversight people in japan to keep
[02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:26.580]  uh a critical information uh the worst case information from
[02:28:26.580 --> 02:28:29.620]  members of the government including the chief cabinet secretary
[02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:34.660]  well it's not a good sign when the u.s military u.s embassies french german
[02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:38.020]  pull out when foreign airlines won't fly into tokyo
[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:41.460]  when the fleet raced away last monday when fukushima 3
[02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:45.620]  blew up and now when the head of the plant itself breaks down in cries and
[02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:50.260]  says basically i can't lie to you this radiation is going to kill people
[02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:53.700]  uh that's that that shows you what's really happening
[02:28:53.700 --> 02:28:57.940]  right and we have to be worried here about the uh radiation that's coming
[02:28:57.940 --> 02:29:01.140]  over the west coast because well we know that uh
[02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:04.660]  based on what we saw with the golf oil disaster
[02:29:04.660 --> 02:29:08.740]  how our own government downplays the health effects of these
[02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:12.340]  natural disasters the other thing i want to add quickly is
[02:29:12.340 --> 02:29:17.140]  i'm afraid we may see the international bankers these vampires vultures and
[02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:21.620]  vermin now try to play this up as much as they can
[02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:26.100]  to try to just put japan the third largest economy in the world
[02:29:26.100 --> 02:29:31.060]  under their firm control meanwhile a headline up at drudge also on info
[02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:34.420]  wars dot com white house works quietly to
[02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:38.740]  squelch the the photos they've already released photos of them
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:44.020]  killing kids uh so man wane madson thank you for joining us
[02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:48.020]  we'll be right back with dr tarpley

[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:23.940]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:26.900]  with yourself produced nano silver solutions

[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:13.460]  as we're finishing off this agenda we'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:16.660]  americans at home i've determined its influence
[02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:20.660]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:31:20.660 --> 02:31:25.860]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:31:25.860 --> 02:31:29.140]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:31:29.140 --> 02:31:33.540]  the criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty

[02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:39.860]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists they're asking for more matches
[02:31:39.860 --> 02:31:42.340]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:46.740]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[02:32:27.700 --> 02:32:31.620]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:31.620 --> 02:32:34.740]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose

[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:02.340]  in office and this will be the kamikaze model
[02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:05.620]  of playing states off against each other funding cia
[02:37:05.620 --> 02:37:10.420]  mi6 uh groups try to overthrow the muslim nations
[02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:13.780]  because this is all that stated as their plan then coming in with air power
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:17.220]  behind them to back them up what does this signify
[02:37:17.220 --> 02:37:20.100]  that germany and turkey have broken away from nato
[02:37:20.100 --> 02:37:23.380]  what does it signify for the first time ever to have the un
[02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:27.460]  issue the order and in less than 48 hours about 26 hours
[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:30.820]  attacks to be launched with no congressional involvement we're seeing
[02:37:30.820 --> 02:37:35.300]  some big moves here what does it signify webster griffin tarpley
[02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:39.300]  well i would say first of all that the the fact that the nato
[02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:44.580]  and obama have had to use uh military force they've had to bomb
[02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:48.180]  libya back into the stone age with massacres of civilians
[02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:51.380]  this is a defeat for them because their plan had been
[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:55.780]  to use the model of the color revolution the cia people power coup
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:38:00.180]  the national endowment for democracy push from behind the scenes
[02:38:00.180 --> 02:38:04.100]  to do this all without military force that was what they were able to do in
[02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:07.700]  tunisia and then in egypt and of course the reality is that there's a
[02:38:07.700 --> 02:38:12.340]  military coup going on behind the scenes and then you have this clown show
[02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:15.700]  of street demonstrations that the media try to
[02:38:15.700 --> 02:38:19.940]  uh say is actually causing it whereas of course it's not causing it it's just
[02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:23.140]  window dressing something like this is going on in yemen today
[02:38:23.140 --> 02:38:26.660]  there's a military coup behind the scenes some top general and a tribal
[02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:29.300]  leader have turned against the president of yemen
[02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:32.580]  and you have street demonstrations but the reality is the coup
[02:38:32.580 --> 02:38:35.700]  now obama is obviously embarrassed you can see the
[02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:39.780]  the sneaky cowardly way that obama started this war
[02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:43.940]  obama does not have the guts to give a an oval office speech
[02:38:43.940 --> 02:38:47.780]  and look the american people like george w bush did yeah
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:53.220]  even george w bush was a very blunt uh aggressor he was an imperialist aggressor
[02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:56.660]  and he made no bones about it and he looked you in the eye and said
[02:38:56.660 --> 02:39:00.020]  i'm an imperialist aggressor but with obama it's all deception
[02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:04.500]  and we have this charade going on the u.s is obviously the leading edge of the
[02:39:04.500 --> 02:39:09.700]  attack the 125 cruise missiles fired in the night between uh saturday and
[02:39:09.700 --> 02:39:12.820]  sunday that's the that's the main guts of this attack
[02:39:12.820 --> 02:39:16.740]  but instead we have the british and the french in some way
[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:21.460]  in in the charade this this dumb show where they pretend to be the leading
[02:39:21.460 --> 02:39:25.780]  edge and of course they they are not uh the french were able to get i think all
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:32.340]  of 1515 aircraft over uh over serenade over libya
[02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:36.420]  on the on saturday that's that's pathetic uh
[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:39.540]  but the u.s cruise missiles are the ones that are doing the work
[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:43.140]  and now i think what you're seeing though because of this attempt
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:47.460]  to to have propaganda showing the british and the french in the lead
[02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:51.060]  this is going to lead to to military chaos and the command and control
[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:54.100]  structure because you already have the following situation
[02:39:54.100 --> 02:40:00.020]  the italians say we will not allow britain and france to use these critical
[02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:05.140]  bases sigonella in sicily and elsewhere we want the nato
[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:08.980]  command to do this because we're idly we're not subjected to
[02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:13.540]  britain and france we are part of nato but then the french say no we can't do
[02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:17.780]  that because we have these arab puppet states that we want to participate we
[02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:22.340]  have katar the aljazeera base and by the way a lot of them are
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:26.020]  starting to back out right now and having reservations because of how
[02:40:26.020 --> 02:40:30.180]  bad it looks at home right and then that's it that the katar and the united
[02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:34.740]  arab emirates now today in cairo we had a meeting of the arab league and of
[02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:37.460]  course this amir musa the head of the arab league
[02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:40.900]  had been out in front demanding a no fly zone but
[02:40:40.900 --> 02:40:45.220]  this is a guy who wants to be president of egypt and he can see that the arab
[02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:49.780]  street the arab marketplace is now turning against the u.s once again and
[02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:53.380]  against nato because of this this massacre that's going on so we had this
[02:40:53.380 --> 02:40:57.380]  and even if they don't like qaddafi you got a route for the underdog
[02:40:57.380 --> 02:41:01.460]  well they don't like imperialist aggression and qaddafi is looking better
[02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:05.620]  and better by the hour we had ban ki moon the u.s puppet who is the
[02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:09.860]  nate the u.n secretary general he wanted to go to tahrir square
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:14.020]  and strut and posture and free himself as a hero of democracy
[02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:17.860]  and these the egyptian protesters have finally done something good
[02:41:17.860 --> 02:41:21.540]  the egyptian protesters are finally fighting the imperialists
[02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:25.700]  instead of acting as their as their tools they wouldn't let ban ki moon
[02:41:25.700 --> 02:41:30.100]  make his triumphal tour of tahrir square and as you mentioned
[02:41:30.100 --> 02:41:34.180]  germany was never in this they have tremendous doubts
[02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:38.900]  the turks are not happy the italians are the least happy of all but they're
[02:41:38.900 --> 02:41:41.380]  they're so weak that they don't know what to do
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:48.420]  interestingly today putin putin says the the u.n resolution is in effect a
[02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:53.140]  medieval call for a crusade against libya and putin has
[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:56.820]  drawn the lesson himself he has ordered the doubling of russian missile
[02:41:56.820 --> 02:42:00.100]  production so they can see the handwriting on the wall
[02:42:00.100 --> 02:42:04.180]  naturally the fact that russia and china did not
[02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:08.340]  veto this monstrosity last week in the united states
[02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:12.420]  this was this was not a profile encouraged to put it mildly uh...
[02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:16.180]  they could have stopped it they should let me stop you there why are the
[02:42:16.180 --> 02:42:22.660]  globalists moving in such a naked way now what what is triggering this
[02:42:22.660 --> 02:42:27.540]  it is the war on the nation's state itself if you look at the tarply dot net
[02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:31.780]  or my twitter feed webster g tarply i go through this question of
[02:42:31.780 --> 02:42:36.020]  all the countries in the middle east are looking for a way to get
[02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:40.020]  out of the anglo-american plantation they don't want to be subjected to the
[02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:44.500]  united states anymore in order to do that you've got to make a deal with russia
[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:48.500]  which saudi arabia had been doing you've got to make a deal with china that was
[02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:53.300]  the path chosen by by algeria by uh... by pakistan
[02:42:53.300 --> 02:42:57.060]  or you make a deal with iran and that was what mubarak had been doing and
[02:42:57.060 --> 02:43:00.660]  many others so in order to get out of the empire
[02:43:00.660 --> 02:43:04.100]  you've got to turn to some other power source and that basically comes down to
[02:43:04.100 --> 02:43:09.860]  russia china and into some degree iran the u s british answer to that is well
[02:43:09.860 --> 02:43:14.100]  if we can't control these puppet states anymore these say traps or vice roys of
[02:43:14.100 --> 02:43:18.580]  our empire we will destroy them so you can see what they're going for
[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:22.420]  sudan has been carved into two parts mainly to prevent the chinese from
[02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:26.020]  getting the oil in south sudan that's their bare minimum in libya they want
[02:43:26.020 --> 02:43:29.140]  to break it with their group in the east and and and break it
[02:43:29.140 --> 02:43:33.220]  breaking it in this case means in the case of libya it means an attempted return
[02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:37.220]  to tribalism with the tribes of serenaica against the tribes of
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:40.820]  triple detainee at the east again so that's the post industrial tribal
[02:43:40.820 --> 02:43:45.540]  balkanization model call it tribalism call it warlords it's the destruction
[02:43:45.540 --> 02:43:49.860]  of the nation state so in effect if you want to defend human civilization
[02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:53.940]  you have to take your stand in defense of the modern nation state
[02:43:53.940 --> 02:43:57.380]  not with the secessionist you can see what it is right the guys in serenaica
[02:43:57.380 --> 02:44:01.540]  are the secessionists yemen is being carved on the north south axis
[02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:06.580]  pakistan the whole goal of that guy ray davis there that that he's accused by
[02:44:06.580 --> 02:44:09.460]  the pakistanis of being a terrorist controller
[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:13.860]  dealing in nuclear materials for a radio but what triggered them to do
[02:44:13.860 --> 02:44:18.420]  something this dangerous uh... you've always said as the dollar
[02:44:18.420 --> 02:44:22.180]  starts to die they were going to start a war to basically threaten everybody
[02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:26.500]  well if you if you look i i go through i have a grid in this article that i've
[02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:29.220]  done on on top of that then you go through the grid
[02:44:29.220 --> 02:44:33.780]  and you can see that that all of these countries algeria has got 40 000 chinese
[02:44:33.780 --> 02:44:38.500]  workers building things right what do the anglo americans offer the anglo americans
[02:44:38.500 --> 02:44:41.620]  come in there when they say free market free trade
[02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:45.780]  deregulate privatize bust your unions break up the state sector
[02:44:45.780 --> 02:44:49.380]  imf shock therapy and of course that means you're going to be destroyed
[02:44:49.380 --> 02:44:52.900]  and the the west also then says we're also going to meddle in your
[02:44:52.900 --> 02:44:56.580]  internal affairs under so the bankers are declaring war basically on everyone
[02:44:56.580 --> 02:44:59.460]  we're going to put your article up on screen from carply dot net
[02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:02.740]  we're also going to post it uh... we forgot to do that at info wars
[02:45:02.740 --> 02:45:06.100]  dot com right now marley's doing that but but i mean so this is a
[02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:08.340]  desperation move is it not
[02:45:08.340 --> 02:45:13.620]  yes it's essentially uh... simultaneous assault on the nation state
[02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:17.620]  uh... all across the world and with and if the leading edges wiki leaks
[02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:22.340]  wiki leaks last week published new documents proving that the president of
[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:27.620]  indonesia is corrupt and bribed uh... and you can see they're going through the
[02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:31.940]  entire cia hit list is reflected in the choice of
[02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:35.620]  documents that come out with with wiki leaks so wiki leaks i think is is
[02:45:35.620 --> 02:45:39.060]  clearly exposed to the cia limited hangout self-exposure
[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:42.420]  self-exposure operation but the targets of this are
[02:45:42.420 --> 02:45:44.900]  the government that they want to overthrow
[02:45:44.900 --> 02:45:48.740]  so uh... it has it has parallels to the revolutions of eighteen forty eight you
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:51.700]  can see that in in some some other stuff that i've written
[02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:55.620]  but the idea is to have a wave of destabilizations
[02:45:55.620 --> 02:46:00.500]  that leaves either the nations themselves shattered and divided and
[02:46:00.500 --> 02:46:05.700]  balkanized and carved or maybe in some place like egypt which is harder to
[02:46:05.700 --> 02:46:10.740]  split up a government that is so weak and so passive and pathetic that
[02:46:10.740 --> 02:46:14.420]  it can easily be the ordered around what's your what's the name of the
[02:46:14.420 --> 02:46:17.620]  headline of the article that you want us to put on screen
[02:46:17.620 --> 02:46:21.860]  well i wouldn't do the most recent one i did with obama's bay of pigs
[02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:24.660]  yeah that's the one we've got where is this grid because i'm gonna put it on
[02:46:24.660 --> 02:46:29.620]  screen read is the the previous one uh... it's it's the one about um...
[02:46:29.620 --> 02:46:35.940]  it's it's essentially behind the uh... the orgy of destabilizations
[02:46:35.940 --> 02:46:38.980]  you've got uh... i think that's the beginning of the title behind the orgy
[02:46:38.980 --> 02:46:40.580]  of destabilization
[02:46:40.580 --> 02:46:44.900]  is an attempt so where did the globalist go next after this
[02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:49.540]  uh... well if today it's yemen uh... bacharine in bacharine is targeted
[02:46:49.540 --> 02:46:50.740]  because they've
[02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:53.460]  the bacharine royal family told the u.s
[02:46:53.460 --> 02:46:56.340]  you're not allowed to use the base of the fifth fleet
[02:46:56.340 --> 02:46:57.940]  to attack iran
[02:46:57.940 --> 02:47:02.500]  uh... algeria is a target algeria is the other country in north africa that has
[02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:04.020]  a lot of oil
[02:47:04.020 --> 02:47:07.540]  uh... and that's the place where they've tried to play the china card right
[02:47:07.540 --> 02:47:08.580]  but the flicker
[02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:11.940]  has turned to the chinese for infrastructure and development and
[02:47:11.940 --> 02:47:14.820]  they've been building everything they're building highways and
[02:47:14.820 --> 02:47:17.940]  and uh... all sorts of uh... infrastructure that the west
[02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:19.300]  of course refuses
[02:47:19.300 --> 02:47:22.980]  to provide so uh... and indonesia you can look towards them
[02:47:22.980 --> 02:47:27.700]  uh... i expect there's a good possibility of a shooting war with pakistan
[02:47:27.700 --> 02:47:32.500]  if the united states becomes bogged down now in libya especially if the uh...
[02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:34.500]  ground invasion of libya
[02:47:34.500 --> 02:47:37.140]  occurs which i think is an eminent possibility
[02:47:37.140 --> 02:47:40.100]  i don't think about these forces being destroyed
[02:47:40.100 --> 02:47:41.060]  by this uh...
[02:47:41.060 --> 02:47:42.420]  this bombing attack
[02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:45.860]  uh... maybe when the u.s gets bogged down in libya the people in pakistan will
[02:47:45.860 --> 02:47:47.700]  say now it's time for us to work
[02:47:47.700 --> 02:47:51.620]  to invite the u.s to leave which means to cut that supply line
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:53.700]  that goes from carachi to uh...
[02:47:53.700 --> 02:47:55.300]  the kiber past the main
[02:47:55.300 --> 02:47:58.340]  the main supply line the other things have turned to stress is
[02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:04.580]  the weakness of the imperialists in 1991 when bush the elder attacked iraq
[02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:08.420]  he had one thousand five hundred combat aircraft fifteen hundred
[02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:12.740]  in nineteen ninety nine when clinton gore and and blair
[02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:16.660]  struck at syria they had a hundred and fifty sorties the first day
[02:48:16.660 --> 02:48:20.180]  this time around fifteen fifteen french aircraft now
[02:48:20.180 --> 02:48:22.660]  there were then the hundred and twenty five cruise missiles
[02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:27.780]  but in terms of manned aircraft the imperialists are going down down down
[02:48:27.780 --> 02:48:32.420]  and i think um... kudafi has some surprises up his sleeve in the military
[02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:35.620]  sense why don't we say we don't want to find out what those are
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:39.940]  let's call a halt to this thing uh... it's time for a democratic primary
[02:48:39.940 --> 02:48:43.380]  challenge to obama i don't know what anybody's waiting for
[02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:46.740]  all right let me stop you there let me stop you there tarpaul because while
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:47.860]  we've got you
[02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:50.500]  in limited time i want to look at what you just raised
[02:48:50.500 --> 02:48:54.580]  we've got incredible hype right now the kudafi is going to launch terror attacks
[02:48:54.580 --> 02:48:58.500]  in europe of the u.s that will be then used as the excuse to
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:02.980]  push the full ground invasion and as a domestic police state clamp down
[02:49:02.980 --> 02:49:08.820]  to legitimize the tsa the spy grid uh... i think that fits into their overall
[02:49:08.820 --> 02:49:13.140]  stratagem or strategies uh... their deceptive strategy
[02:49:13.140 --> 02:49:16.740]  uh... to stage a terror attack i think that's a real danger
[02:49:16.740 --> 02:49:20.500]  well they they were hoping on this repeatedly with saddam hussein right in
[02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:24.420]  nineteen ninety one for the first call for and then in two thousand three
[02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:27.780]  they were hot they were hoping and hyping on this and it it never happened
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:30.740]  so i don't see that at all i think you thought he is too smart
[02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:34.820]  for that kind of no they may stage it are they may stage it but i'm trying to
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:38.580]  say this won't be coming from kudafi
[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:41.300]  now going back to ground invasion you think that's
[02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:45.220]  in the offing they've got the invasion ships off the shore the trip ships give
[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:47.860]  us your breakdown of why you think that could be eminent
[02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:52.420]  well if you're dealing with the french british imperialist now this is the
[02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:56.900]  Suez coalition of nineteen fifty six this has special characteristics
[02:49:56.900 --> 02:50:00.740]  on the british side these guys are the colonel blimp's right there that the
[02:50:00.740 --> 02:50:04.500]  uh... the british generals who you know that their latest exploits have been in
[02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:07.700]  northern ireland uh... they're essentially coming from a
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:11.300]  tradition of military losers and on the french side it's another
[02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:16.180]  tradition of military losers going back to vc and marshal petain
[02:50:16.180 --> 02:50:19.700]  so this is not a pretty thing but they're now claiming
[02:50:19.700 --> 02:50:22.980]  uh... that the the british and the french are going to take it over
[02:50:22.980 --> 02:50:26.980]  uh... the military forces of the french and the british are obsolete
[02:50:26.980 --> 02:50:32.340]  the british are flying still these tornado jet aircraft the tornadoes
[02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:36.500]  salamu sain shot down seven tornadoes twenty years ago
[02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:39.700]  in the first golf war yeah in the first two days so they withdrew them from the
[02:50:39.700 --> 02:50:42.820]  field about these are not reliable planes they're old
[02:50:42.820 --> 02:50:46.660]  now there is this uh... euro fighter typhoon that's ultra modern
[02:50:46.660 --> 02:50:49.780]  but they're the problem is that it's never been used in combat so nobody
[02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:52.660]  nobody knows what the bugs might be the truth is they haven't been running
[02:50:52.660 --> 02:50:55.140]  around like the u.s. engaged in constant wars
[02:50:55.140 --> 02:50:58.740]  so they're not good at it like uh... the united states is
[02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:02.580]  drenched in blood stay there webster let's let's continue hi this is alex
[02:51:02.580 --> 02:51:04.740]  jones did you know that the global elite are now
[02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:08.500]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[02:51:08.500 --> 02:51:11.860]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[02:51:11.860 --> 02:51:15.700]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing gold and silver
[02:51:15.700 --> 02:51:19.060]  before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[02:51:19.060 --> 02:51:22.820]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[02:51:22.820 --> 02:51:26.580]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[02:51:26.580 --> 02:51:30.260]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:33.540]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[02:51:33.540 --> 02:51:37.460]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a

[02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:12.340]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:16.340]  we've spent an inordinate amount of time with the north african situation
[02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:19.940]  this sets an incredible precedent where the un calls the shots
[02:54:19.940 --> 02:54:24.180]  as the puppet of the globalist now there's protests in other countries will
[02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:27.460]  they invade them that clearly is their fake moral
[02:54:27.460 --> 02:54:31.220]  high ground webster i don't want to hear how you want to have this
[02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:34.900]  end sure with a democrat coming out is truly anti-war and a
[02:54:34.900 --> 02:54:38.260]  challenger to obama the the empire is going bankrupt we
[02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:43.060]  can't have four wars list those four wars but instead how do you see this
[02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:47.140]  ending where do you see this going well the wars of course are the iraq war
[02:54:47.140 --> 02:54:50.420]  which continues the u.s. is incapable of imposing
[02:54:50.420 --> 02:54:54.260]  the puppet alawi that they want and the pro- iranian maliki
[02:54:54.260 --> 02:54:57.700]  remains in power that's a very serious index to the weakness of the
[02:54:57.700 --> 02:55:00.180]  of the u.s. which you could see all last year
[02:55:00.180 --> 02:55:05.060]  second one of course is afghanistan where cars i said last week nato must get
[02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:08.740]  out of my country get out and then they of course they've walked it back and
[02:55:08.740 --> 02:55:12.580]  now we have these atrocities the photos that you that you're referring to
[02:55:12.580 --> 02:55:16.820]  pakistan has been a war of the united states against pakistan
[02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:21.140]  since the west point speech by obama in december of 2009
[02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:25.060]  we're as clear the goal is to export the afghan civil war
[02:55:25.060 --> 02:55:29.460]  into pakistan break it up along those lines punjab send
[02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:32.820]  balochistan prashtunistan four to five ways
[02:55:32.820 --> 02:55:35.940]  split it up so it can't be an energy corridor between
[02:55:35.940 --> 02:55:39.380]  iran and uh... and china and now we have
[02:55:39.380 --> 02:55:43.060]  libya um and i i think the uh...
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:46.900]  the the the guaranteed result unless somebody does something unexpected
[02:55:46.900 --> 02:55:52.740]  let's put it that way is a further decline in world civilization is libya
[02:55:52.740 --> 02:55:55.860]  is the most developed country in africa libya
[02:55:55.860 --> 02:56:01.220]  has a higher position on the united nations human development index
[02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:04.500]  than russia ukraine brazil or venezuela
[02:56:04.500 --> 02:56:08.900]  there did that he has done a better job than anybody in the middle east
[02:56:08.900 --> 02:56:13.700]  when it comes to spreading the oil wealth around to the people they've got
[02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:16.740]  they've got fewer people in jail than the czech republic and of course far
[02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:20.100]  fewer than the u.s per per population so
[02:56:20.100 --> 02:56:24.020]  this is now in the process of being destroyed that the imperialist plan
[02:56:24.020 --> 02:56:28.500]  is to have the country uh... permanently split and talk to have maybe two or
[02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:32.900]  three different tribal coalitions contending it would go back to what it
[02:56:32.900 --> 02:56:36.900]  was uh... under the uh... under the italian occupation under martin marshal
[02:56:36.900 --> 02:56:41.780]  graziani back in the in the 1920s and 30s it's essentially a bunch of
[02:56:41.780 --> 02:56:45.460]  and musselini went in there too and pardon me
[02:56:45.460 --> 02:56:48.500]  didn't musselini going to libya too that's what i'm saying that's it these
[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:51.860]  are generals working for for musselini and they they of course committed
[02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:57.300]  tremendous atrocities so uh... it's essentially the decline of civilization
[02:56:57.300 --> 02:57:02.180]  itself unless somebody does something on it's the bankers for those that don't
[02:57:02.180 --> 02:57:05.940]  know what a hostile takeover and a breakup is they come into real companies
[02:57:05.940 --> 02:57:09.860]  or or or countries that have wealth and they just break it all up
[02:57:09.860 --> 02:57:13.780]  and sell it for pennies on the dollar basically give it to themselves
[02:57:13.780 --> 02:57:16.820]  they're doing this to the whole world right now
[02:57:16.820 --> 02:57:20.900]  yes and of course now there there are other other possibilities you look at
[02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:25.140]  egypt now i think encouraging news this morning is that the egyptian protesters
[02:57:25.140 --> 02:57:29.060]  have finally figured something out that that the banqui moon and and musa are
[02:57:29.060 --> 02:57:32.020]  imperialist and uh... this is not not good
[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:37.060]  uh... are there nationalist colonels in the egyptian army are there people in
[02:57:37.060 --> 02:57:41.140]  the egyptian army who are disgusted by the behavior of field marshal
[02:57:41.140 --> 02:57:45.140]  tentawi and it's clique of generals who forced mubarak
[02:57:45.140 --> 02:57:49.780]  out of the country uh... if there are some colonels in the tradition of nasser
[02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:53.780]  from the 1950s that would be that would be something good
[02:57:53.780 --> 02:57:58.340]  um... if you have uh... similar forces maybe in algeria
[02:57:58.340 --> 02:58:01.140]  uh... that's that those are also possibilities
[02:58:01.140 --> 02:58:04.740]  i think the other thing is we've got to realize that the the entire operation
[02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:08.580]  violates the the u n charter the u n charter says
[02:58:08.580 --> 02:58:12.180]  the chapter seven military measures can only be used
[02:58:12.180 --> 02:58:15.780]  to restore international peace and security never
[02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:19.620]  for interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states in this case this is
[02:58:19.620 --> 02:58:23.140]  pure interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state it is
[02:58:23.140 --> 02:58:27.140]  illegal under the charter and this it points to why the united
[02:58:27.140 --> 02:58:30.420]  nations is totally unworkable because you have this
[02:58:30.420 --> 02:58:34.260]  this this gaggle of five webster webster we're out of time we'll talk to you
