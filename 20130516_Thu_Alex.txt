[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.680 --> 00:32.320]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:32.320 --> 00:39.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. It is Thursday, the 16th day of
[00:39.080 --> 00:48.720]  May, 2013. And we are going to be live here for the next three hours. Joseph Kerl, White
[00:48.720 --> 00:54.520]  House correspondent and reporter for The Washington Times and drugsreport.com will be joining
[00:54.520 --> 00:58.720]  us to give us his take on all the unfolding, exploding scandals.
[00:58.720 --> 01:04.240]  Then Kevin Booth has had, what is it, Warner Brothers pick up his American Drug War II.
[01:04.240 --> 01:07.960]  I consulted and worked on American Drug War I. And this one gets into what the drug war
[01:07.960 --> 01:11.880]  is doing to children. And I'm told by people that have seen it, I haven't seen it yet,
[01:11.880 --> 01:16.960]  it's gonna come out on, I think it's HBO, absolutely tear jerking and really exposes
[01:16.960 --> 01:17.960]  the phony drug war.
[01:17.960 --> 01:21.440]  Again, I don't like drugs, folks, they destroy a lot of people. The drug war is meant to
[01:21.440 --> 01:27.660]  keep the prices up to put money into the drug war for the big banks and others. Drugs should
[01:27.660 --> 01:34.200]  be not shown as sexy, but as loserish. Kevin Booth's gonna be joining us and his film actually
[01:34.200 --> 01:41.160]  does that. Larry Pinckney, founding Black Panther, their communications director of
[01:41.160 --> 01:44.640]  the original Black Panther Party who saw all the COINTELPRO firsthand.
[01:44.640 --> 01:48.040]  He's here in Austin, we flew him in. He's being interviewed for an upcoming film. He's
[01:48.040 --> 01:53.400]  gonna be in studio with us in the third hour today. So Joseph Kerl, Kevin Booth and Larry
[01:53.400 --> 02:02.440]  Pinckney today. That said, I told you that my gut told me that this Benghazi gate thing,
[02:02.440 --> 02:05.800]  after I really saw it explode last week.
[02:05.800 --> 02:12.720]  And now the IRS gate and the spying gate and the harassment of the whistleblowers, the
[02:12.720 --> 02:18.560]  torture coming out of Benghazi, that's what's really serious. That report a month ago that
[02:18.560 --> 02:22.660]  was in the New York Times, but just in the back of the paper, that a congressional bipartisan
[02:22.660 --> 02:27.440]  committee found war crimes of George W Bush and Obama.
[02:27.440 --> 02:32.120]  That's a big part of this, there's ongoing torture. In fact, Obama has expanded it according
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.340]  to all of our sources and evidence that's come out. I mean, they are torturing at more
[02:36.340 --> 02:47.560]  than 100 sites around the world that are known. 30 something in Iraq, two in Guantanamo Bay,
[02:47.560 --> 02:51.380]  they have a big camp and another camp within it, two sites there.
[02:51.380 --> 02:58.080]  They're torturing in Egypt and a bunch of sites in Romania, in Poland, in Ukraine, in
[02:58.080 --> 03:06.200]  Georgia, and in the United States, reportedly, and other locations. And it is hard core.
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.840]  And again, it is not, quote, real terrorists that are being tortured. It is people for
[03:10.840 --> 03:15.000]  fake confessions, you name it. You cannot believe a word. It's like when our pilots
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.680]  would get shot down by Northern Vietnam, and then a year later appear on North Vietnamese
[03:18.680 --> 03:25.160]  TV and film releases saying, we're evil, we target civilians on purpose.
[03:25.160 --> 03:29.760]  We drop this and that, a lot of it wasn't true. Everybody knew you don't listen to that,
[03:29.760 --> 03:35.960]  it's not admissible, because they admittedly use torture. They put you in a cage smaller
[03:35.960 --> 03:41.220]  than your body for a year. And by the way, everybody breaks and ends up saying whatever
[03:41.220 --> 03:42.900]  they want them to say.
[03:42.900 --> 03:48.600]  Most people would break in a few hours buried alive, stuff like that. And that's what goes
[03:48.600 --> 03:57.440]  on at Guantanamo Bay. That's what goes on at the camp within it, the CIA base. That's
[03:57.440 --> 04:02.020]  what goes on these places. And some of these guys are so tough, like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
[04:02.020 --> 04:06.760]  waterboarded was hundreds of times that he would not break and confess the things he
[04:06.760 --> 04:12.960]  hadn't done until they brought his kids in and started to go to work on them.
[04:12.960 --> 04:18.600]  And then he said, look, I'll say whatever you want. I'll say whatever you want. And
[04:18.600 --> 04:23.760]  he confessed to bombing buildings that were built four years after he was in custody.
[04:23.760 --> 04:34.600]  He was in custody seven years before he broke. Seven years of torture, seven. You say what
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.440]  you want about Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, whoever that double, triple agent really is, but tough
[04:39.440 --> 04:48.840]  as nails. Oh, man, I tell you, we'll be right back. We're going to get into all of it. This
[04:48.840 --> 04:55.040]  is big. This whole thing's big. It's all unraveling very, very quickly right now. Stay with us.
[04:55.040 --> 05:00.760]  We'll be right back.
[05:00.760 --> 05:05.440]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[05:05.440 --> 05:11.040]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

[08:08.040 --> 08:18.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:18.920 --> 08:27.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 16th day of May, 2012. I am your host, Alex
[08:27.760 --> 08:33.780]  Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next 3 hours. Joseph Curl, senior writer
[08:33.780 --> 08:39.840]  and White House correspondent for the Washington Times, also Drudge researcher, DrudgeReport.com
[08:39.840 --> 08:46.480]  researcher will be popping in at the bottom of the hour via the road via cell phone to
[08:46.480 --> 08:51.280]  give us to the latest inside. Believe me, he's got all the inside sources on how serious
[08:51.280 --> 08:53.720]  and how big all of this is.
[08:53.720 --> 08:58.560]  The word he gave me is it's gonna be the IRS stuff and the spying that's gonna probably
[08:58.560 --> 09:03.640]  bring down Obama, not Benghazi. Now, that's when I talked to him yesterday. We're gonna
[09:03.640 --> 09:09.440]  see the latest info he's got at the bottom of the hour. Kevin Booth has got his new American
[09:09.440 --> 09:14.720]  Drug War II being put out by Warner Brothers coming out soon, very powerful.
[09:14.720 --> 09:17.760]  I haven't seen it, but I've talked to people that have seen it. And there's not a dry eye
[09:17.760 --> 09:24.040]  in the house. It shows what the drug war does to kids. That is all coming up. And Larry
[09:24.040 --> 09:28.960]  Pinckney, former communications director for the original Black Panther Party, to talk
[09:28.960 --> 09:32.880]  about government dirty tricks and more will be in studio with us.
[09:32.880 --> 09:36.920]  He's here to be interviewed for the Obama deception part two. That's why he's in town.
[09:36.920 --> 09:43.440]  We flew him in yesterday. He got in last night. We've got new Boston bombing info. We've got
[09:43.440 --> 09:51.200]  amazing the good, the bad, the ugly on the Second Amendment front. We have Russian government
[09:51.200 --> 09:56.400]  putting in a war fleet and the Mediterranean and an escalation of the Syria situation.
[09:56.400 --> 10:00.240]  Israel says they will bring down Assad if he retaliates for future airstrikes. It's
[10:00.240 --> 10:03.940]  like, we're gonna bomb you now. And if you fight back in any way, we're gonna basically
[10:03.940 --> 10:07.840]  blow your whole country up. I think that's reasonable. I think Syria should be nuked
[10:07.840 --> 10:11.960]  and every man, woman, and child killed and Al Qaeda should be put in charge.
[10:11.960 --> 10:17.760]  And I think Israel is right to be doing that. So there you go. I support Israel 110%. It's
[10:17.760 --> 10:20.940]  a little bit of satire there. I mean, it just shows how all these governments are completely
[10:20.940 --> 10:26.800]  out of control. And it's even in mainstream news now, I was on some of the Israeli news
[10:26.800 --> 10:30.840]  sites and the people there are going, why are we putting Al Qaeda in there?
[10:30.840 --> 10:34.960]  Why are we doing this? I mean, Assad's not doing anything to us. I mean, I'm not a fan
[10:34.960 --> 10:44.120]  of Assad, but the Jews in Israel, in the Jerusalem Post and Herats and all the others in times
[10:44.120 --> 10:50.680]  of Israel, go read the comments. About half of them are going, what on earth is going
[10:50.680 --> 10:52.480]  on here?
[10:52.480 --> 11:00.960]  What is happening here? So even the Israelis don't like what's happening and going on on
[11:00.960 --> 11:06.160]  that front, we're gonna be getting to all of that. But when I talk about rats leaving
[11:06.160 --> 11:17.640]  the sinking ship, when I talk about things like that, I'm here on air. It's Thursday
[11:17.640 --> 11:23.000]  radio broadcast and I'm about to go live a few minutes ago and I think to myself, what
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.080]  do I cover first in this scandal?
[11:28.080 --> 11:35.020]  Here's the bottom line, I figured that you would see more of a Benghazi whitewash. Because
[11:35.020 --> 11:44.200]  if the Republicans got into the open lies, where the system has been caught red handed,
[11:44.200 --> 11:49.360]  covering up, ordering a stand down, their own security force attacking the facility.
[11:49.360 --> 11:53.480]  The stand down, the fact that they got caught lying about the stand down, now they put out
[11:53.480 --> 12:02.380]  selected emails to try to cover their trail and say that they knew nothing. If the Republicans
[12:02.380 --> 12:06.320]  went with that, which they never do, because they don't want to bring down the whole system
[12:06.320 --> 12:09.020]  because they're so tied into it.
[12:09.020 --> 12:14.360]  If they went into any areas of truth on Benghazi, it would bring down Obama. So I said, I don't
[12:14.360 --> 12:19.680]  expect them, and I'm rarely wrong, and I was wrong last week, last Wednesday with the testimony
[12:19.680 --> 12:25.200]  was at Tuesday. I said, I don't expect them to really get into this and they're just gonna
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.200]  say it was a screw up and they were incompetent and try to score some political points.
[12:29.200 --> 12:35.240]  But because the witnesses bucked the gag orders and the threats and went ahead and told the
[12:35.240 --> 12:43.400]  truth, this whole thing blew up in the establishment's face. And now, Boehner and people that were
[12:43.400 --> 12:51.720]  basically involved in a giant whitewash, they are now being forced to talk about criminal
[12:51.720 --> 12:59.900]  investigations, arrest, an IRS gate, you name it.
[12:59.900 --> 13:04.680]  Because there's total credibility hemorrhaging going on right now, and there's not much blood
[13:04.680 --> 13:09.300]  to run out of this thing left. The globalists are in shock, they're in trouble, this happens
[13:09.300 --> 13:14.680]  throughout history. And so many times people just can't believe that a tyranny has a fall
[13:14.680 --> 13:18.200]  or that tyranny gets damaged.
[13:18.200 --> 13:26.000]  Tyranny is in serious trouble right now, it's flailing around. And if we intensify the attack
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.320]  instead of standing back and watching the spectacle, if we just fire everything we've
[13:30.320 --> 13:35.920]  got at them politically with the truth and keep pounding and keep discrediting, it's
[13:35.920 --> 13:42.360]  going to give other cowards in the media political cover who don't like what's been going on
[13:42.360 --> 13:44.300]  and who have a conscience.
[13:44.300 --> 13:51.520]  It's going to give them cover to have more of a swarm attack on the corrupt system. And
[13:51.520 --> 13:56.560]  if we get them on Benghazi and IRS gate and Spygate and all this, it's over folks, it
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.440]  will give other people courage. They've been trying to intimidate all the whistleblowers.
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.600]  It's been coming down with both feet trying to shut down any opposition to corruption.
[14:06.600 --> 14:11.360]  They've been trying to have a reign of intimidation. And the minute that damn breaks, which is
[14:11.360 --> 14:18.000]  starting to happen, it will cause a flood that could really bring real reform to this
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  country.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.440]  But you're going to have to decide that you have power. You're going to have to decide,
[14:23.440 --> 14:26.420]  I'm not even talking to our audience, they know that. I'm talking to mainstream media
[14:26.420 --> 14:30.680]  that listens to this show. You're going to have to decide that you don't wanna be total
[14:30.680 --> 14:37.440]  mouthpieces anymore. And you've also got to stop being so arrogant and still thinking
[14:37.440 --> 14:39.960]  that you're able to bamboozle the public.
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.840]  Because a lot of you are sociopathic in your business dealings. You may not even be totally
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.400]  sociopathic, but you behave like sociopaths. And some of you are not just sociopaths, you're
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.640]  psychopaths. But even a cold blooded psychopath would not wanna be involved with this new
[14:55.640 --> 14:57.880]  world order unless you have a death wish.
[14:57.880 --> 15:03.600]  And some of you are very, very dark. You're in love with darkness and you're enjoying
[15:03.600 --> 15:11.320]  the spectacle of globalism. But that's a very small percentage of people. Maybe, maybe one
[15:11.320 --> 15:19.000]  tenth of 1% are really, really French kissing the devil and really know what they're into.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.040]  Most of you are cowardly that serve evil and you recognize its power. And so you think
[15:24.040 --> 15:28.360]  by embracing it, you're going to get power when all you turn into is a chicken neck slave
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.600]  by serving, okay?
[15:31.600 --> 15:38.920]  And if you had good natures in you, you would have known that real power is in goodness,
[15:38.920 --> 15:44.880]  but that you wouldn't be good for the power sake. Because with great power comes great
[15:44.880 --> 15:51.380]  responsibility, but I'm gonna stop preaching. I was initially wrong because I'm just so
[15:51.380 --> 15:54.120]  used to the system whitewashing everything.
[15:54.120 --> 15:59.160]  This is blown up. That testimony was real. It was epic. It was historical last Thursday,
[15:59.160 --> 16:06.840]  last Friday as all that broke. And now the power structure is in major damage control.
[16:06.840 --> 16:11.560]  They may stage new wars. They may stage new terror attacks. And even if they did something
[16:11.560 --> 16:16.600]  giant, the cat is out of the bag, the genie's out of the bottle, the horse left the stable,
[16:16.600 --> 16:21.680]  the train left the station, Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall.
[16:21.680 --> 16:24.960]  And all the king's horses, all the king's men aren't gonna put it back together again.
[16:24.960 --> 16:32.200]  It is the best of times, the worst of times. It was a time of great knowledge and of incredible
[16:32.200 --> 16:38.120]  foolhardiness, to paraphrase A Tale of Two Cities. You guys actually print me or put
[16:38.120 --> 16:44.640]  up on screen the opening of Tale of Two Cities. I don't wanna butcher that citation.
[16:44.640 --> 16:48.480]  The issue here is it is the best of times, the worst of times. That's how the universe
[16:48.480 --> 16:55.520]  works. As great evil rises, great good rises. For every action, there's an equal and opposite
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.720]  reaction. It's quantum mechanics. But all the ancients knew this. And so as evil tries
[17:00.720 --> 17:09.720]  to take over, it actually opens windows for good to come in and shift the script.
[17:09.720 --> 17:14.080]  There it is. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was the age of
[17:14.080 --> 17:19.760]  wisdom. It was the age of foolishness. It was the epoch of belief. It was the epoch
[17:19.760 --> 17:25.560]  of incredulity. It was the season of light. It was the season of darkness. It was the
[17:25.560 --> 17:26.560]  spring of hope.
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.880]  It was the winner of despair. We had everything before us. We had nothing before us. We were
[17:31.880 --> 17:42.040]  all going direct to heaven. We were all going direct to hell. Man, the classics. I mean,
[17:42.040 --> 17:51.640]  does that not say everything right there? I mean, how could anybody not be incredibly
[17:51.640 --> 17:54.880]  energized right now?
[17:54.880 --> 18:01.960]  But the minute I saw those deputy ambassadors, the minute I saw the head of anti-terrorism
[18:01.960 --> 18:06.700]  for the State Department, the minute I saw them with tears in their eyes but steel in
[18:06.700 --> 18:13.600]  their jaws and the courage to tell the truth, and the minute I saw the goosebumps on their
[18:13.600 --> 18:18.920]  skin, and I saw that, it's like you could see it on me right now.
[18:18.920 --> 18:23.480]  The minute they stepped into the truth, it was like an electrical charge connected and
[18:23.480 --> 18:28.080]  I went, whoa, I was wrong. This is the fall of Obama if you want it. But it's more than
[18:28.080 --> 18:34.160]  the fall of Obama. It is a chink in the armor. Take that crowbar and just rip it in and reach
[18:34.160 --> 18:37.240]  in there to the heart of the New World Order.
[18:37.240 --> 18:42.520]  Tear it out. Because I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, people don't believe they have
[18:42.520 --> 18:46.900]  power. They don't believe the great can fall. They believe these crooks in government with
[18:46.900 --> 18:55.980]  their con man confidence game facade of false chutzpah, bravada, machismo, aplomb, whatever
[18:55.980 --> 19:04.580]  you wanna call it, it is just that, it is a facade. They are scared. They live lives
[19:04.580 --> 19:10.440]  of fear and insecurity.
[19:10.440 --> 19:15.240]  Now here's what I'm talking about. They excised two days of the emails and there's emails
[19:15.240 --> 19:18.640]  in there in this fake data leak they've done to cover up Benghazi and act like they didn't
[19:18.640 --> 19:22.720]  do anything with Petraeus saying, I don't like what you've done. That's why they got
[19:22.720 --> 19:29.480]  rid of him. This is our sources said back in October, wow, they were all on target.
[19:29.480 --> 19:34.920]  And now you've got Congressmen saying the Justice Department cloakroom was wiretapped.
[19:34.920 --> 19:42.080]  Yeah, that's what senators and people are saying a lot more is about to come out. And
[19:42.080 --> 19:49.760]  you've got rats running. We've got slimeball Chris Matthews saying he doesn't like Obama
[19:49.760 --> 19:56.280]  anymore. And you've got absolute minion Bill Press saying it. I mean, that is the signal
[19:56.280 --> 20:00.080]  that the rodents are running in fear. This is the end of Obama.

[21:07.400 --> 21:12.240]  that trample the American dream. You know what we all face. A crashing economy that's
[21:12.240 --> 21:16.800]  forcing millions out of work and from their homes. Half of Americans need help just to

[22:33.320 --> 22:37.560]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[22:37.560 --> 22:41.680]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[22:41.680 --> 22:44.960]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[22:44.960 --> 22:48.440]  army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our

[23:03.080 --> 23:07.160]  security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is
[23:07.160 --> 23:12.080]  home at your house while you're away plugs into any wall outlet is recommended by many
[23:12.080 --> 23:18.640]  police departments and sells for less than $30. Yes, it's fake TV. This year, about one
[23:18.640 --> 23:23.640]  in every 50 US homes will have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target
[23:23.640 --> 23:29.080]  a dark house that looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device
[23:29.080 --> 23:34.680]  that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[23:34.680 --> 23:39.660]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been
[23:39.660 --> 23:46.960]  ransacked to get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to fake tv.com or call
[23:46.960 --> 24:12.720]  1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388 or go to FAKETV.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[24:12.720 --> 24:20.840]  So Bill press, the globalist minion has now come out and said that Obama is just a horrible
[24:20.840 --> 24:27.600]  basically and that Attorney General Eric Holder should step down. The Atlantic wire that is
[24:27.600 --> 24:32.520]  basically the official White House, one of its official White House propaganda organs
[24:32.520 --> 24:37.640]  is calling for Holder's head or saying it was imminent, that he's gonna have to step
[24:37.640 --> 24:45.640]  down after his I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I'm not a crook, Nixon 2.0 or
[24:45.640 --> 24:47.640]  Nixon squared.
[24:47.640 --> 24:52.500]  You've got the guy that said he gets excited, tingle up his leg into his groin area when
[24:52.500 --> 25:00.400]  he hears Obama talk. That's pretty disgusting imagining a slimeball and Obama hanging out.
[25:00.400 --> 25:05.400]  He says he doesn't get the tingle anymore. So there you go. He does not get aroused when
[25:05.400 --> 25:08.740]  watching and listening to Obama.
[25:08.740 --> 25:14.000]  So there you go. And that's kind of the meter, the canary in the coal mine is if Chris Matthews
[25:14.000 --> 25:22.240]  is not aroused in his groin region when Obama is on television, that's it. I mean, that's
[25:22.240 --> 25:26.680]  kind of like the cooking timer, ding. All right, Chris Matthews does not wanna date
[25:26.680 --> 25:28.760]  Obama anymore.
[25:28.760 --> 25:33.680]  It's all or whatever it means to have a tingle up your leg. Pretty much everybody thinks
[25:33.680 --> 25:37.560]  that means a twinkle in the eye. I don't know what, I mean, I have a little bit of humor
[25:37.560 --> 25:41.920]  here because this is so out of control. But of course the NSA and Justice Department is
[25:41.920 --> 25:43.440]  tapping Congress.
[25:43.440 --> 25:50.080]  They've caught MI6 and MI5 tapping Parliament in England. This is the illegitimate bureaucracy
[25:50.080 --> 25:54.960]  tapping the real government. The bureaucracy tells Congress they can't see the Homeland
[25:54.960 --> 26:00.820]  Security directives. They tell the Homeland Security Committee, you can't see PDD 51.
[26:00.820 --> 26:06.360]  You can't see our orders for civil unrest. That's dictatorship right there, folks. The
[26:06.360 --> 26:10.880]  central government is now run by foreign interests that control the president and they're out
[26:10.880 --> 26:11.880]  of control.
[26:11.880 --> 26:19.160]  But the routing of these people has begun. And here is the Congressman Devin Nunes on
[26:19.160 --> 26:24.640]  a radio show. This is big news, it's out of the Weekly Standard. This has been announced
[26:24.640 --> 26:32.800]  since last night, saying that they were tapping the cloak room. The cloak room, which is where
[26:32.800 --> 26:36.160]  they go into the little office areas and, you know, sit around and talk on the telephone
[26:36.160 --> 26:37.160]  or talk to each other.
[26:37.160 --> 26:38.480]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[26:38.480 --> 26:42.400]  I don't trust the Department of Justice on this, do you Congressman Nunes?
[26:42.400 --> 26:49.120]  No, I absolutely do not, especially after this wire tapping incident, essentially, of
[26:49.120 --> 26:52.640]  the House of Representatives. I don't think people are focusing on the right thing when
[26:52.640 --> 26:59.120]  they talk about the going after the AP reporters. The big problem that I see is that they actually
[26:59.120 --> 27:01.640]  tapped right where I'm sitting right now.
[27:01.640 --> 27:06.520]  Wait a minute, this is news to me, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[27:06.520 --> 27:12.160]  So when they went after the AP reporters, right, went after all of their phone records,
[27:12.160 --> 27:15.960]  they went after the phone records, including right here in the House gallery, right up
[27:15.960 --> 27:21.280]  from where I'm sitting right now. So you have a real separation of powers issue here that,
[27:21.280 --> 27:25.760]  you know, did this really rise to the level that you would have to get phone records that
[27:25.760 --> 27:29.800]  would most likely include members of Congress? Because as you know, members of Congress talk
[27:29.800 --> 27:31.080]  to the press all the time.
[27:31.080 --> 27:34.880]  I did not know that, and that is a stunner.
[27:34.880 --> 27:39.080]  It's a separation of powers issue here, and it's a freedom of press issue, and now you've
[27:39.080 --> 27:44.480]  got the IRS going after people. So these things are starting to cascade one upon the other,
[27:44.480 --> 27:48.280]  and you have the White House pretending like they're in the clouds, like it's not their
[27:48.280 --> 27:51.200]  issue somehow.
[27:51.200 --> 27:54.960]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen, and that was Hugh Hewitt's radio show. I think I've
[27:54.960 --> 28:00.800]  been on that show. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, and this is what Mitch McConnell
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.760]  said last week on Sunday. He said, a lot more is coming out. You ain't seen nothing yet.
[28:06.760 --> 28:12.200]  We gotta come back with that liner. You ain't seen nothing yet, baby. No, you ain't seen
[28:12.200 --> 28:13.200]  nothing yet.
[28:13.200 --> 28:16.960]  And we could sit here and joke around about this. This is very, very serious. Speaking
[28:16.960 --> 28:22.280]  of joking around, more and more people who have not been politically active other than
[28:22.280 --> 28:26.800]  through their satire like Mike Judge are speaking out against the New World Order, against things
[28:26.800 --> 28:28.080]  going on.
[28:28.080 --> 28:31.680]  And that's what it's gonna take is all of you that have been silent in power positions
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.440]  or just out there upon the fruited plain, all of us have power. We've got to say no
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.720]  to this system. We've got to raise our voices against it. And I've talked to Mike Judge
[28:41.720 --> 28:45.620]  for years, off and on, off the telephone and text messages and things, but we've always
[28:45.620 --> 28:47.760]  both been busy and I've never really bugged him.
[28:47.760 --> 28:52.000]  So we never hung out, but I hung out quite a bit with him this week, Monday and Tuesday,
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.960]  did a big interview with him. It's about 50 minutes long. We're gonna premiere it, a shot
[28:55.960 --> 29:01.160]  at his house in high def video next Thursday here on the radio slash TV show. And it's
[29:01.160 --> 29:07.260]  gonna be a newsmaking interview. A lot of it's about him growing up and but also Second
[29:07.260 --> 29:08.360]  Amendment, things like that.
[29:08.360 --> 29:13.200]  It's pretty powerful. So I want to take you out here with Hank Hill and Beavis and Butthead
[29:13.200 --> 29:18.280]  via via the one, the only Mike Judge. Here it is.
[29:18.280 --> 29:29.280]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones. Infoworth.com.

[33:27.880 --> 33:52.480]  Alright folks, we are joined by Joseph Curl, political correspondent, White House reporter
[33:52.480 --> 33:58.080]  for The Washington Times, broken some of the biggest stories in the last 20 years politically
[33:58.080 --> 34:04.600]  and that's why he also is one of the heavy hitters, the few, the proud, the drudges over
[34:04.600 --> 34:14.400]  at drudgereport.com. Who can say that? Not many, ladies and gentlemen. And I introed
[34:14.400 --> 34:20.440]  this with you ain't seen nothing yet because when you have Congressman Devin Nunes coming
[34:20.440 --> 34:25.200]  out and saying, look, they were spying on the cloakroom and Congress and that's a separation
[34:25.200 --> 34:26.200]  of powers violation.
[34:26.200 --> 34:30.320]  Well, yeah, can you imagine if the Congress was spying on the White House with illegal
[34:30.320 --> 34:35.320]  wiretaps and he's like, does that rise to impeachment? I don't know, does Charlie Manchin
[34:35.320 --> 34:41.840]  cutting babies out of Sharon Tate's stomach rise to murder? I mean, it's like, well, it
[34:41.840 --> 34:49.520]  is the president, maybe he's allowed to. I mean, even the Republicans cannot get hardcore
[34:49.520 --> 34:53.760]  with things that are just out in the open because our normalcy bias is to accept anything.
[34:53.760 --> 35:01.040]  It's like we have mass Stockholm syndrome, but let me tell you, political catastrophe,
[35:01.040 --> 35:08.600]  political Waterloo, political rigor mortis is setting in to the Obama administration
[35:08.600 --> 35:11.480]  with I don't know, I don't remember, I know nothing.
[35:11.480 --> 35:16.840]  I'm Sergeant Schultz from Hogan's Heroes with all of them being caught lying on Benghazi,
[35:16.840 --> 35:23.000]  the IRS spying, the whistleblower persecutions, the wiretapping, all of it, they're in deep
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.420]  trouble. And that's why you've got Bill Press saying the Attorney General needs to step
[35:27.420 --> 35:34.000]  down and Obama and Chris Matthews says his leg doesn't get the tingle up into his groin
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.040]  anymore over this.
[35:35.040 --> 35:39.400]  And all of these people are running scared. The Atlantic wire that basically is a White
[35:39.400 --> 35:44.720]  House organ says is the end of the Eric Holder's tenure at the Justice Department. It's not
[35:44.720 --> 35:49.120]  enough to throw him under the bus, not enough to go, all of them, okay, they need to go
[35:49.120 --> 35:54.400]  to jail. These guys make Nixon look like an angel compared to the things they've done
[35:54.400 --> 35:55.500]  and what they've been caught doing.
[35:55.500 --> 36:02.180]  And joining us is Joseph Curl of the washingtontimes.com and drudgereport.com, the guy who really has
[36:02.180 --> 36:06.700]  the inside scoop. Will it be Benghazi? Will it be IRS gate? Will it be spy gate? Will
[36:06.700 --> 36:12.640]  it be intimidation gate? Will it be perjury gate? Will it be, I mean, can we bring back
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.680]  fast and furious now? Will this bring down Obama and what you expect him to try to do
[36:17.680 --> 36:18.680]  to stop it?
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.040]  What is the inside Intel directly from the belly of the beast, the district of criminals,
[36:23.040 --> 36:24.040]  Joe curl.
[36:24.040 --> 36:25.040]  Hey buddy.
[36:25.040 --> 36:31.920]  The most fascinating thing that's been happening so far, the thing that really intrigued me
[36:31.920 --> 36:37.600]  out of this whole, now this, this train of message, but as you mentioned, fast and furious
[36:37.600 --> 36:41.560]  is still hanging out there. We've never really gotten any answers on that, but the most
[36:41.560 --> 36:47.680]  amazing thing, and it just keeps happening is the lack of accountability from the administration.
[36:47.680 --> 36:51.800]  It's really, you know, my buddy over at the Washington Post, Dana Milbank wrote today
[36:51.800 --> 36:56.800]  that the holder seemed almost proud to not know anything. You know, what you've got
[36:56.800 --> 37:01.560]  over in the, in the justice department now is he recused himself from this whole AP,
[37:01.560 --> 37:05.640]  you know, seizing the phone records of the associated press. And he literally sat in
[37:05.640 --> 37:09.640]  front of the Congressman and just said, I don't, I don't know anything. I mean, he
[37:09.640 --> 37:13.960]  was calling in front of Congress and then he said for four hours, I don't know anything.
[37:13.960 --> 37:18.880]  And then you've got, you've got Hillary. She's not involved in, doesn't know anything
[37:18.880 --> 37:24.200]  about about Benghazi gate. You've got, you know, now, now we're hearing that the white
[37:24.200 --> 37:30.280]  house is trying to spin the whole IRS mess as a couple of low level guys in Cincinnati
[37:30.280 --> 37:35.720]  who were just rogue operators who were doing something. Nobody knows anything. The weirdest
[37:35.720 --> 37:39.800]  thing, and I was talking to my dad the other night about, yeah, he remembers all the way
[37:39.800 --> 37:44.480]  back to Eisenhower and Truman and he was saying, you know, Terry Truman had a, had a big placard
[37:44.480 --> 37:48.960]  on his, on his desk that says the buck stops here right now. We don't know where this buck
[37:48.960 --> 37:49.960]  stops.
[37:49.960 --> 37:53.880]  But what Obama keeps saying is it sure as heck doesn't stop with me.
[37:53.880 --> 37:59.040]  Well, we know where the buck stops. I mean, Obama gets his orders from the big unions,
[37:59.040 --> 38:03.720]  from the big foreign banks. He gets his orders from the, basically the socialist, the communist
[38:03.720 --> 38:08.120]  party. He gets his orders from the big tax free foundations. I mean, he gets his orders
[38:08.120 --> 38:10.120]  from the heirs.
[38:10.120 --> 38:16.840]  Right. And they're spending, they're spending all of their time and effort. You know, I
[38:16.840 --> 38:22.280]  think, I think it's not, it's not ludicrous to start talking about Richard Nixon because
[38:22.280 --> 38:25.600]  this is the classic, and I wrote a column about this a couple of weeks ago in the Washington
[38:25.600 --> 38:26.600]  Times.
[38:26.600 --> 38:31.840]  The classic conundrum of the second term, these guys, guys all get invested, all the
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.720]  way back to Eisenhower, you know, with the U2, and then you've had, you know, Reagan
[38:36.720 --> 38:43.440]  had Iran-Contra, Clinton, of course, had Monotone, literally. You had Bush, who had his own problems
[38:43.440 --> 38:49.120]  and messes going on. And now you've got, now you've got Obama with, with this, it's
[38:49.120 --> 38:54.520]  the biggest problem and the way you can talk about Nixon in the, in the same breath of
[38:54.520 --> 38:59.120]  Obama, even though these things are, are just starting, is it's all cover up. It comes
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.440]  cover up on how they deal with the information. We're starting to hear weird little things
[39:04.440 --> 39:11.680]  that, you know, this, this IRS stuff was actually known years ago within the IRS and, and, and
[39:11.680 --> 39:15.560]  weeks ago at the White House, but nothing ever really came out of it until right before,
[39:15.560 --> 39:21.120]  the reason they eventually put this out or put it out when they did, was that the Inspector
[39:21.120 --> 39:24.520]  General's report was about to come out. They knew it was about to break anyway, so
[39:24.520 --> 39:29.240]  they had to dump it. So, yeah, it's just, it's just, it's very strange what's
[39:29.240 --> 39:36.080]  happening and it, it really makes me wonder, you know, this is, this is an administration
[39:36.080 --> 39:39.640]  that hasn't really had any scandals. All of a sudden, they've got three scandals
[39:39.640 --> 39:44.280]  going at the same time and I think I was, I sent you a message the other day saying,
[39:44.280 --> 39:48.640]  you know, Ben Gonsalves is the big one and it wouldn't surprise me if, if they had
[39:48.640 --> 39:53.840]  these scandals hanging around and they just, and they just dumped them out to try and steal
[39:53.840 --> 39:55.800]  the real scandal, which is Ben Gonsalves.
[39:55.800 --> 39:59.720]  Yeah, and then we talked on the phone, you said Ben Gonsalves is the big one, but you,
[39:59.720 --> 40:04.360]  you were saying at least a few days ago, you expect the IRS deal to be the one that actually
[40:04.360 --> 40:07.920]  could bring them down. Yeah, well, I mean, that's, that's the,
[40:07.920 --> 40:12.040]  that's the one that really crosses over, you know, that does get right into McSoney
[40:12.040 --> 40:16.240]  himself. That's, that's what, that's what Nixon was doing. Nixon was using the IRS
[40:16.240 --> 40:22.480]  to literally target his enemy. He was telling the IRS to go out and, and, and get my enemy.
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.840]  Now, you know, the real question is going to be where, where does this come down? And,
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.480]  you know, guys, presidents have gotten better and better at plausible reliability and, and
[40:33.480 --> 40:37.960]  not leaving any fingerprints on anything. So the question is, will this ever be traceable
[40:37.960 --> 40:44.320]  back to Obama? And, and, and the answer is probably not. But the thing that's most
[40:44.320 --> 40:49.920]  striking to me is, you know, this is a, this is a, a culture now, a culture of corruption
[40:49.920 --> 40:55.200]  that, that's endemic to the, to this administration and, and administration-wide. I mean, we're
[40:55.200 --> 40:59.640]  seeing it across all these different agencies. You know, when you have the Justice Department
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.240]  coming in and saying, I don't know what's happening, you have the attorney general saying,
[41:03.240 --> 41:08.120]  I don't know what's going on in my own building. And I would accuse myself of this
[41:08.120 --> 41:12.320]  major saying, so I just had some underling doing whatever it was he was doing. You've
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.360]  got the, you've got the secretary of state saying, I don't really know what happened
[41:16.360 --> 41:20.240]  that night in Benghazi. You've got the IRS. We don't know what happened. The president
[41:20.240 --> 41:22.920]  doesn't know what happened. Nobody seems to know what's going on.
[41:22.920 --> 41:27.960]  Well, by the way, Joseph Carroll, they have a new witness, Hillary and Eric Holder, and
[41:27.960 --> 41:33.360]  all of them announced they're going to have a special spokesman now testify for them.
[41:33.360 --> 41:37.360]  And he's going to come on the show with us right now. This is the White House's statement
[41:37.360 --> 41:38.360]  on any further scandals.
[41:38.360 --> 41:46.520]  Oh, I see nothing. I was not here. I did not even get up this morning.
[41:46.520 --> 41:49.960]  So there you go. That's the new White House press secretary.
[41:49.960 --> 41:57.240]  I know nothing. I mean, it was, it was, it was really, it was really shocking. Yes, man.
[41:57.240 --> 42:01.920]  I loved, I loved that, you know, CNN and MSNBC, they were still doing their, their OJ reports
[42:01.920 --> 42:06.200]  and, and their little lighthearted things. And here you've got the attorney general testifying
[42:06.200 --> 42:11.120]  saying, I don't know, I don't know what's happening in, in, in the Department of Justice.
[42:11.120 --> 42:14.500]  I don't know what's going on there. I, I had it, but I have no idea what's happening.
[42:14.500 --> 42:17.320]  And by the way, as you know, just over the weekend, they were arrogant saying it's no
[42:17.320 --> 42:23.000]  big deal. The Democrats were defending it on MSNBC. Good. We need to persecute tea parties.
[42:23.000 --> 42:28.360]  Now they've just sacked the IRS commissioner today. Now Democrats, what does it signify
[42:28.360 --> 42:29.360]  to have slime?
[42:29.360 --> 42:34.840]  I mean, Chris Matthews of slime ball to have bill press, to have all of the Atlantic wire
[42:34.840 --> 42:40.440]  running from Obama and holder right now. Are we seeing the beginning of a route? What is
[42:40.440 --> 42:42.520]  the atmosphere there in DC?
[42:42.520 --> 42:48.680]  Well, that's another fascinating part of it. What you've got, you know, whatever I think
[42:48.680 --> 42:54.400]  of the media and how they, what they did in the second, in the second, you know, the reelection
[42:54.400 --> 42:59.720]  campaign, the coverage that Obama got. I mean, remember we had, we had unemployment, you
[42:59.720 --> 43:04.920]  know, hovering around eight and a half percent. The economy is terrible. Everything that,
[43:04.920 --> 43:09.280]  you know, Obamacare is going to be a nightmare. Everything that was happening really should
[43:09.280 --> 43:15.760]  have been failed for a president trying to get reelected. But the media was the one that,
[43:15.760 --> 43:21.080]  you know, unified behind Obama to continue to sell him. I think what is beginning to
[43:21.080 --> 43:26.720]  happen right now is the media is starting to look at this president and go and say collectively,
[43:26.720 --> 43:32.520]  boy, we backed, we backed a big time loser. And if we don't get off this guy, pretty soon
[43:32.520 --> 43:38.120]  we're all going to go down with him. I mean, this is, you know, liberals like to say that
[43:38.120 --> 43:44.240]  Bush's presidency was the worst ever. It certainly wasn't. And I think we might really
[43:44.240 --> 43:49.280]  literally be looking at one of the worst presidencies in the last hundred years. I mean, we're going
[43:49.280 --> 43:54.960]  to end up, right now the recession is longer than the Depression, the Great Depression.
[43:54.960 --> 44:03.960]  The job numbers are terrible. And then we've got all this corruption and all this crazy
[44:03.960 --> 44:04.960]  stuff going on.
[44:04.960 --> 44:11.200]  Could you say this is the I know nothing administration? Because they say, oh, the economy's great.
[44:11.200 --> 44:15.760]  They lie about everything. And why do you think suddenly things are turning against
[44:15.760 --> 44:19.320]  them? I mean, I agree with you. There was kind of a hope that other scandals that they
[44:19.320 --> 44:24.480]  think are more survivable other than lying about a stand down so people can be killed.
[44:24.480 --> 44:30.560]  But I mean, even that, going from crisis to crisis, I have a sense from afar watching
[44:30.560 --> 44:36.720]  this that this could really end in the impeachment of Obama, you name it. I mean, what's your
[44:36.720 --> 44:37.720]  gut?
[44:37.720 --> 44:44.000]  Well, that's what's been really interesting to me. And I think you said your message on
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.480]  the IRS thinking that that was a really big one. But it was before I really started to
[44:48.480 --> 44:53.280]  think about the way this is going to play out. And we're seeing it play out right now.
[44:53.280 --> 44:58.720]  I mean, yesterday, Obama was, you know, trying to look like the take charge guy. He makes
[44:58.720 --> 45:03.600]  it sound like he's just heard about this, even though we're hearing that he actually
[45:03.600 --> 45:08.240]  knew about it for several weeks in the White House. So what he does is he comes on TV
[45:08.240 --> 45:18.680]  last night and he says that he asked his surgery secretary to request the resignation from
[45:18.680 --> 45:23.400]  the IRS head. Now, the IRS head, he's only the acting head of the IRS. He's only been
[45:23.400 --> 45:29.160]  in there for a while. And his term was ending in June anyway. So I wasn't really thinking
[45:29.160 --> 45:34.360]  how this thing plays out. So what you have there is you've got a low-level, do-nothing
[45:34.360 --> 45:40.360]  guy who's not really responsible for this, who he now loses his job. And they're going
[45:40.360 --> 45:48.400]  to end up fobbing the rest of this stuff off on these rogue IRS agents in Cincinnati. So
[45:48.400 --> 45:55.040]  that scandal is going to come and go. And you've got, on the phone records scandal,
[45:55.040 --> 45:59.440]  you're basically going to have, I mean, maybe this deputy attorney general will be
[45:59.440 --> 46:03.880]  canned over at the Department of Justice. But Eric Holder's going to, you know, it
[46:03.880 --> 46:09.920]  looks like right now, stay among this whole fray. I doubt that Obama's going to kill
[46:09.920 --> 46:15.920]  his good buddy over there and let him go. So these things would play out for several
[46:15.920 --> 46:20.160]  more months. But in the end, you're probably just going to have some low-level guys fall
[46:20.160 --> 46:25.760]  on their swords and disappear. And that's what's starting to make me wonder if this
[46:25.760 --> 46:30.160]  isn't all there to obscure Benghazi. And when the-
[46:30.160 --> 46:33.080]  No, but I tend to agree with you. I mean, that's when we talk on the phone, that's what
[46:33.080 --> 46:39.040]  I think is going on, is Benghazi. There was a stand down, a bunch of the military were
[46:39.040 --> 46:44.560]  there and witnessed it. Now they're putting out selective emails with two-day gaps. I
[46:44.560 --> 46:49.800]  agree with you. It's been Ghazi that is really what they're afraid of. What's the word on
[46:49.800 --> 46:54.360]  that? Are they going to get away with that as well? Or will they politically be destroyed
[46:54.360 --> 47:00.880]  and be a total lame duck now, but criminally get away with it and just kind of drift into
[47:00.880 --> 47:01.880]  the future?
[47:01.880 --> 47:07.920]  Yeah, I do think, I mean, you know, remember that that was more than six months ago on
[47:07.920 --> 47:16.320]  September 11, 2012. So, the media couldn't care less about that story until the Weekly
[47:16.320 --> 47:22.120]  Standards, Stephen Hayes pulled all that stuff up and threw that out there. They go about
[47:22.120 --> 47:27.000]  the emails and about the, you know, who was saying what at the time about the video and
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.280]  about the spontaneous demonstration, which never, you know, neither of those were ever
[47:30.280 --> 47:37.960]  involved. So, the really interesting thing is going to be how, that's what I've been
[47:37.960 --> 47:41.720]  noticing, is how do they get, how do they change this subject from Benghazi? Because
[47:41.720 --> 47:46.280]  Benghazi is reaching critical mass now. So, how do we get off Benghazi? Well, let's throw
[47:46.280 --> 47:52.600]  them a couple of scandals that will really consume Washington. And Washington far more
[47:52.600 --> 47:59.120]  interested in the IRS scandal because they're newer and the phone scandal than they are
[47:59.120 --> 48:04.040]  in Benghazi. And then the last thing that's fascinating is the White House, you know,
[48:04.040 --> 48:08.760]  they have, they don't know anything about, you know, the White House spokesman doesn't
[48:08.760 --> 48:14.560]  know anything about the AP phone scandal and pushes that over to the Department of Justice.
[48:14.560 --> 48:20.200]  They're outraged over the IRS thing and they're taking action on that. But on Benghazi, they
[48:20.200 --> 48:26.120]  dismissed it as just a political wish hunt. And that, again, strikes me as that's what
[48:26.120 --> 48:29.440]  they want those- Yeah, no, no, their jihadis killed everybody
[48:29.440 --> 48:32.920]  and they ordered to stand down and a bunch of missiles are missing. And finally, Fox
[48:32.920 --> 48:39.360]  News was covering that over the weekend. So, you know, my gut tells me, Joe Kerling and
[48:39.360 --> 48:43.880]  Washington Times joining us, my gut tells me, though, that they'll be lucky if they're
[48:43.880 --> 48:47.760]  just politically destroyed and then powerless for three years.
[48:47.760 --> 48:52.440]  But I don't even see that happening. I smell blood in the water and I think even starting
[48:52.440 --> 48:57.680]  new wars is not gonna politically get them out of this. I see a total loss of confidence
[48:57.680 --> 49:03.520]  in them. All the Democrats I know finally hate Obama and finally are apologizing to
[49:03.520 --> 49:07.520]  me for saying he's a crook. I mean, you know, you're more of a journalist, so you stick
[49:07.520 --> 49:08.920]  to what you can 100% prove.
[49:08.920 --> 49:15.840]  I'm a journalist and a pundit. And I can say as a pundit, I think Obama is politically
[49:15.840 --> 49:22.840]  rotting. What do you say to that? Well, I think that's absolutely right. I think, you
[49:22.840 --> 49:28.280]  know, there was a question as to whether he was really ever gonna get anything done with
[49:28.280 --> 49:29.280]  him.
[49:29.280 --> 49:34.080]  Because remember, he's the one who's created this poisonous atmosphere in Washington. He's
[49:34.080 --> 49:39.720]  the one who has literally spent four years haranguing Congress and blaming everything
[49:39.720 --> 49:44.480]  on Congress. Well, now he needs Congress and you're right, even some Democrats now are
[49:44.480 --> 49:50.560]  starting to shift on Obama and abandon him. So, yeah, I think politically he's gone.
[49:50.560 --> 49:56.320]  I think it's, you know, he's not gonna get anything through Congress again. And I think
[49:56.320 --> 50:00.760]  if the integration thing is gonna fall apart, I think he wants to get done are gonna fall
[50:00.760 --> 50:07.480]  apart because you're beginning to see, even Democrats are beginning to wonder about this
[50:07.480 --> 50:12.640]  guy and they don't have his back anymore. And that's the problem that Obama always
[50:12.640 --> 50:19.880]  had is that he's been so aggressively critical of Congress that he doesn't really have any
[50:19.880 --> 50:20.880]  friends over there.
[50:20.880 --> 50:24.600]  He doesn't talk with them often. He doesn't, you know, meet with them privately and-
[50:24.600 --> 50:29.200]  Yeah, I thought Bush vacationed a lot. Obama's like vacation something like double what Bush
[50:29.200 --> 50:32.200]  did and seems completely disconnected and arrogant.
[50:32.200 --> 50:36.360]  Well, if you're nervous, and I'm sure your listeners have noticed, that has also been
[50:36.360 --> 50:41.280]  kind of the talking point that's been coming out of Washington is he's so bright, he's
[50:41.280 --> 50:47.760]  so intellectual, but he has this problem that Spock has of just being disengaged. He's not
[50:47.760 --> 50:49.360]  emotional because he is so intelligent.
[50:49.360 --> 50:53.360]  Hey, I tell you what, Joe Curl, The Washington Times and DrudgeReport.com do six more minutes

[52:07.680 --> 52:36.520]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[52:37.680 --> 53:03.640]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[53:03.640 --> 53:09.960]  Water Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[53:09.960 --> 53:14.080]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[53:14.080 --> 53:19.660]  President could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[53:19.660 --> 53:24.200]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved

[53:57.800 --> 54:08.520]  It's the only one you've got.
[54:08.520 --> 54:14.480]  You know, I think the degeneration of Obama and how they tried to sell all this collectivist
[54:14.480 --> 54:19.840]  tyranny is trendy. I just think there's a total collapse in confidence in it. And that's
[54:19.840 --> 54:23.560]  going to go for Republicans as well if they don't deliver liberty. That's why Ted Cruz
[54:23.560 --> 54:29.120]  is rising like a rocket. Rand Paul is rising because they're delivering.
[54:29.120 --> 54:33.980]  And the empty demonization, calling Ted Cruz a bully, calling Rand Paul a kook for pointing
[54:33.980 --> 54:39.100]  out the UN treaty, puts the UN over our guns, it isn't working anymore. And you were finishing
[54:39.100 --> 54:44.020]  up your Spock point. And then I wanted to ask you, what's the next big scandals on the
[54:44.020 --> 54:51.720]  radar and other tidbits, Joe Curl of DrudgeReport.com and the WashingtonTimes.com. What else do
[54:51.720 --> 54:57.360]  you expect to see? What other he-nuggets would you like to reveal to the listeners?
[54:57.360 --> 55:03.400]  Well, I will tell you that, and I tweeted this out a couple of days ago, I am a first
[55:03.400 --> 55:07.560]  at the CIA who said, there's another shoe to drop. And I asked him, you mean there's
[55:07.560 --> 55:11.560]  a fourth shoe? And he said, yeah, at least a fourth shoe, maybe a fifth shoe. So there
[55:11.560 --> 55:18.640]  are things out there. I mean, I think it's not inconceivable that there will be something
[55:18.640 --> 55:24.080]  to this whole, you know, apparently the phone records that were repeated not only had to
[55:24.080 --> 55:28.520]  do with the Associated Press, but had to do with their phone lines in various different
[55:28.520 --> 55:33.480]  places, including in the House, and including phone calls that may or may not have been
[55:33.480 --> 55:42.000]  made from the House courtroom. Now, the House courtroom is where members of Congress, members
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.920]  of the House, will go to really do the inside, behind the scenes horse trading, where they
[55:47.920 --> 55:54.000]  really talk about, they really talk far more candidly than they do on the floor, probably
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.320]  than they do in lots of other caucus meetings and things like that. This is when it gets
[55:58.320 --> 56:03.720]  down to the nitty-gritty that they really make deals in the courtroom, where a lot of
[56:03.720 --> 56:10.080]  bills are finally agreed upon. So if they're inside that place, that means that they're
[56:10.080 --> 56:17.200]  inside the halls of Congress. They're literally hearing negotiations on bills and legislation,
[56:17.200 --> 56:24.320]  which is, again, a frightening cross over the First Amendment and constitutional rights.
[56:24.320 --> 56:31.080]  So I think there's something there. I still think, you know, Benghazi, despite the fact
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.520]  that they want to dismiss it as a political witch hunt, and that's how they turn on
[56:35.520 --> 56:39.160]  everything, is that, oh, this is all just political. Well, everything's political,
[56:39.160 --> 56:43.840]  especially with this White House. This White House makes everything political. So there
[56:43.840 --> 56:49.000]  is where we're gonna see more information coming in. It was very smart at the White
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  House yesterday to dump out those emails, because what they did was they put out a selective
[56:55.000 --> 57:01.280]  amount of email, something like 94 emails, that, as you mentioned, don't even begin until
[57:01.280 --> 57:03.840]  67 hours after the attack.
[57:03.840 --> 57:06.840]  We don't know up very much at all.
[57:06.840 --> 57:11.680]  So almost three days, but the lap dog press isn't even pointing that out. They're going,
[57:11.680 --> 57:15.840]  hey, this shows they didn't know anything. See, they are idiots.
[57:15.840 --> 57:22.640]  And see, that's also built by the White House that wants to do this, because when the GOP
[57:22.640 --> 57:26.240]  comes back and says, well, you know, hey, how about the rest of this information? They'll
[57:26.240 --> 57:30.920]  go, look, we're giving you, that's what Jay Clinton likes to do. We've turned him a thousand
[57:30.920 --> 57:31.920]  of documents.
[57:31.920 --> 57:35.840]  Now you can tell it's political witch hunt, because it's never good enough. Whenever we
[57:35.840 --> 57:41.840]  turn over, it's never enough for this crazy lot of Republicans. Well, we're turning over
[57:41.840 --> 57:47.960]  emails that were sent 67 hours after the attack, which means, internally, by that point, you
[57:47.960 --> 57:49.880]  would assume have gotten their stories straight.
[57:49.880 --> 57:55.000]  Oh, yeah, no, no. That's what the Petraeus email's about, is he goes, I don't like the
[57:55.000 --> 57:59.600]  talking point in the narrative I've been given. It's not true. So they even left that in there.
[57:59.600 --> 58:03.680]  Maybe they're lazy or stupid. This is such a cheap trick, though. I mean, this would
[58:03.680 --> 58:08.120]  be like, if I was going out of a parking garage and they wanted my parking ticket, and I said,
[58:08.120 --> 58:09.120]  you know what?
[58:09.120 --> 58:12.480]  I don't have that, but here's a phone book. And they went, no, no, no, no, I want the
[58:12.480 --> 58:17.000]  parking ticket. Hey, I gave you a phone book. That's thousands of pieces of paper. Hey,
[58:17.000 --> 58:21.240]  listen, Joe Curl, people can follow your great columns, what at political theater over at
[58:21.240 --> 58:25.120]  The Washington Times, and a lot of it appears, what, Monday mornings at drudgereport.com.
[58:25.120 --> 58:27.400]  I know you're a busy guy. Thanks for all the time, bro.

[58:50.280 --> 58:55.120]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had
[58:55.120 --> 58:59.120]  a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well
[58:59.120 --> 59:03.680]  known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[59:03.680 --> 59:09.100]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[59:09.100 --> 59:14.560]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer
[59:14.560 --> 59:19.920]  and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and
[59:19.920 --> 59:24.420]  discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real
[59:24.420 --> 59:29.600]  nutrition you need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:22.880]  Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Okay, folks,
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.800]  it is Thursday, the 16th day of May, 2012. And the last 30 minutes I had Joseph Curl
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.880]  of DrudgeReport.com and WashingtonTimes.com on with us. And I was saying bye to him at
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.200]  the end of the hour. And he said, hey, you raised Petraeus. That's the big point we need
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.280]  to get to. So he's graciously held over another five minutes with us. You just joined us to
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:46.480]  the whole thing's unraveling, obviously. They've released from 67 hours later, almost three
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.280]  days later, select emails acting like this is the whole data dump.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.200]  And the media, I have the headlines here. The White House knew nothing about Benghazi.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.640]  They were bumbling idiots. What an old trick. Almost three days after they've got their
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:04.280]  talking point straight. But Petraeus is in the email saying, I don't like these talking
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:10.440]  points. I don't like this story. This basically isn't true. And Curl on air was saying, he's
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.960]  got CIA sources, so do I. I have Defense Department sources, like Colonel Shaffer, who swears
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:16.960]  he'll come on.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.200]  But it's threatened not to since he came on and dropped bombshells back in October right
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.760]  after Benghazi. And so Curl was saying there's more on Petraeus coming, Petraeus knows. Is
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.580]  that why they ran him out? Is that why they fired a bunch of CENTCOM? Joe Curl, what's
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:35.440]  the big scoop on Benghazi, the other shoes to drop? And what do you know about Petraeus?
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.600]  Well, that's the fascinating thing is that when Petraeus happened, you know, remember
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:46.520]  he was head of the CIA and the CIA was heavily involved in Benghazi. In fact, you know, some
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.960]  sources have told me that there was the embassy there in Tripoli, there was the annex as well
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:57.360]  in the consulate in Benghazi, an annex someplace nearby. And people, you know, many people
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:03.600]  have talked about whether there was a dark site in Benghazi, that they were taking some
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.360]  people, suspected terrorists to a place that the CIA may have been heavily involved in,
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:13.920]  we really don't know. But it was remarkable that the head of the CIA, a four-star general
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:20.520]  Petraeus, was drummed out so quickly over a sex scandal. I remember this was after Benghazi
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.720]  happened. And, you know, there were all kinds of speculation, no one could prove anything,
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:31.600]  but there was speculation that Petraeus knew an awful lot and was very unhappy with the
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.880]  dealings with the White House and the story that was formulated and the back and forth.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.800]  And now we are starting to see from these emails someplace between the CIA, the State
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.560]  Department, and the White House. So Petraeus is the one, I think, who knows an awful lot
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.560]  more about this. Now we see in this last email, Petraeus says, you know, after they finally
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:58.520]  get their talking points together, leave out the terrorist attack, leave out al-Qaeda,
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:04.280]  don't mention anything about a spontaneous protest. Now we see that Petraeus said, well,
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.520]  I'd rather not use these talking points, if you don't mind, because they're not accurate.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.520]  They're not even â€“ the CIA, who actually knows what happened there, was telling the
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.280]  State Department, here's what we're comfortable with. And the State Department for political
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.720]  reasons, the White House for political reasons, was saying, well, we shouldn't want to say
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:24.120]  that. The State Department didn't want anything said because they're trying to protect Hillary.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.440]  The White House didn't want anything said because they were trying to win re-election.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.840]  I mean, this is two months before re-election. The last thing they can have is a terrorist
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:39.600]  attack under this president. It was a protest, and we can now call 9-11 a protest under this
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.760]  new labeling. Exactly. So Petraeus is the one I would really
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:52.120]  watch for. I think Petraeus obviously knows everything that's happened there. He's obviously
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:58.400]  not exactly happy with the way he was treated and drummed out. I mean, you know, it's not
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.560]  unheard of for â€“ you know, certainly the Russians will set up their politicians with
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.840]  scandal. Sure. Why don't the Congress â€“ why don't
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.480]  the Republicans call Petraeus for Benghazi hearings?
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:17.120]  Well, that would be a brave move. I mean, if they could bring him in â€“ I mean, the
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.240]  question is whether â€“ I mean, can you still call Hillary Clinton? She was Secretary of
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:26.920]  State then. She isn't now. Can she be called back in to testify in front of Congress? Because
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:33.520]  obviously her testimony now is all suspect. I mean, what she said in front of the House
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:39.680]  committee is now heavily questioned. So can you call her back in? Can you bring back in
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.000]  anyone who's involved, the CIA director like Petraeus?
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.240]  Absolutely. We'll have to get you back up on that soon. In fact, I see you have a column
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:52.560]  from a while back saying, watch for Petraeus in the Benghazi probe scandal. So you called
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.760]  it. Joe Curl, again, thank you so much for the time.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:00.360]  Thanks, Al. We'll be right back, folks. Stay with us.

[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:18.120]  ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:40.160]  live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:48.400]  number two and the scandals enveloping Obama are exploding. And now they put out selected
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.040]  emails to confuse everyone that they didn't know anything about Benghazi.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.040]  But Petraeus and others obviously are out there in the emails exposing that they got
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:02.760]  their story straight over 67 hours before they put out any emails. So they're not putting
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:09.320]  out emails from the first 67 hours. Pretty outrageous, obvious tactic there. You've got
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:16.760]  a hardball, slimeball. Chris Matthews saying he doesn't like Obama anymore. Basically,
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:23.960]  the luster, the tingle in his groin region. His leg has gone away. He's no longer like
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:29.680]  a schoolgirl at a Elvis concert. And then we also have Bill Press coming out against
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:33.200]  the Attorney General, Atlantic Wire coming out against the Attorney General.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.000]  When will they resign? They need to resign. They need to go to jail for Fast and Furious
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.540]  for Benghazi. Now, Congressmen are coming out saying that the word is the cloakroom.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:48.720]  And that's my word is that Mitch McConnell and others know the Congress was being spied
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.360]  on. The cloakroom is where they go to talk shop. That was tapped. Of course, the Congress
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.580]  is tapped. I mean, it came out that's going on in England, the Parliament's tapped. They
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.140]  are spying on the legitimate government.
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.720]  As bad as Congress is, that's the elected government. I mean, they go before Congress
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.920]  and say the NATO commands our military and commands our president. I mean, right there,
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.440]  there should have been arrest. It should have been helicopters landing, mass arrest of all
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:22.560]  these traitors, huge trials. I mean, that was just like, I serve NATO. Our orders come
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.560]  from NATO.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:33.960]  I mean, America's under foreign power control. But instead, Congressman Devin Nunes is like,
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.200]  yeah, the word is we're tapped to the Justice Department. And is that wrong? I mean, is
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.800]  that, we played the clip last hour. It's up on info wars.com and drudgereport.com as it
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.960]  is from the weekly standard.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:49.040]  I mean, is that a wrong thing to do? I mean, does that rise the level of impeachment? I
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.720]  don't know. I mean, it's a felony to do it to anybody without a warrant. But one branch
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:58.960]  of government tapping the other branch illegally, tapping the Congress, is that wrong thing
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:06.160]  to do? Gee, is it wrong what Jeffrey Dahmer did? Is it wrong to rob banks?
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:12.520]  I mean, it just never ceases to amaze me the normalcy bias. And again, if you don't know
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.680]  what the normalcy bias is, we pulled the definition of normalcy bias. Let me give them the technical
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.520]  one. But basically, thanks guys, incredible crew, like, occupants is in there running
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:25.360]  all the stuff, following along with my scatter gun way of meandering rabbit trail way of
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360]  doing things.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:31.840]  It's just that learned helplessness, normalcy bias, it all ties together. But normalcy bias
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.080]  is where you just grow up in tyranny, so you think it's normal. The normalcy bias refers
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.240]  to extreme mental state people enter when facing a disaster, causes people to underestimate
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:45.960]  the severity of the disaster and not to basically respond to it.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.680]  And it's more than that. When you just grow up in disasters, you just think it's normal.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:12:00.400]  Well, we give our firstborn to Herod, or we give our firstborn to the Pharaoh cuz he wants
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:06.280]  them killed, or the Romans wanna kill the firstborn. I mean, government was always in
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.120]  every culture, the Aztecs, I talk about this constantly, they always go, you know, we want
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120]  your kids.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:18.080]  Yeah, we're gonna eat them. Mesoamerica, that was the main meat source, the ruling class,
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:23.840]  we're gonna eat your children. We like the little ones, the veal, the human veal. And
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.760]  again, if you teleported back to the Aztec kingdom 600 years ago, and what's Mexico City
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.640]  today, their headquarters, and you said, I think it's wrong that you're gonna kill that
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:37.740]  one year old boy and chop his heart out and then have the lower priest class sell the
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.740]  meat in the market.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:45.600]  You know, the sun is actually a gaseous nuclear reaction and we orbit it, and it's gonna come
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:51.040]  back up tomorrow, even if you don't chop that heart out. They would look at you and laugh.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:57.560]  And that's the normalcy bias, where we play the clip and Devin Nunes, who you gotta say
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:01.860]  has courage compared to most of them, is like, well, the other big shoe to drop is, we've
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:06.440]  been told the cloakroom is wiretapped and they've bugged us and they're listening to
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.440]  us.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.320]  Is that bad? Is that wrong? And I guess that's a tactic to kinda go, what do you think about
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:19.420]  that? Is that a problem? I mean, maybe he was just being cheeky, but we played earlier
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:25.540]  Sergeant Schultz from Hogan's Heroes going, I know nothing, I know nothing, I know nothing.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:31.520]  But here is the new Sergeant Schultz, Attorney General of Fast and Furious, Deputy Attorney
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.720]  General who covered up Oklahoma City that came out in federal court.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:41.560]  He's a very nice man, Eric Holder. And see, in the beginning of Patriots, a scarce man
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.260]  hated, feared, scorned. But in time when his cause succeeds, Lieutenant join in cuz then
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:50.460]  it caused something to be a patriot. That's Mark Twain. I had to hit the barbed wire early
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:55.800]  on and talk about agenda 21 and cancer viruses and vaccines and the government hiring and
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:56.800]  running Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:02.000]  And then finally, God love them, Glenn Beck started covering it. Michael Savage had been
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.160]  covering it for years, talking about false flags at Obama's stage. And then now Limbaugh's
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:13.360]  covering it and Sean Hannity's covering it. And now more and more people are covering
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:19.200]  it because of infowars.com. And I gotta give credit where credit's due. The first mega
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.320]  alternative media, I mean, what do you call it?
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:28.320]  It's not mainline media, it's not alternative media, it's just free media, drudgereport.com.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.000]  So Infowars, then Drudge, and then now everybody else follows, and that's good. But let me
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.240]  tell you, it's a lonely feeling to be demonized and attacked and know you're right and be
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.120]  out front on things that are admitted and hiding in plain view, like NSA wiretapping
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.120]  of everybody.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:49.120]  Yeah, everything's recorded, Alex. Yeah, it's in the Telecommunications Act, here it is.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.520]  The specs putting it in place in 1996 over a five year period. Here, just read it. I'm
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.640]  not gonna read that kook. Now they're on CNN going, yeah, we record everything you do going
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:06.280]  back at least ten years. Lethal, actually 13, 19, and 2001. So we can just go back and
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.880]  hear all your conversations, for your safety, of course.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.160]  See now, I thought Bilderberg didn't. Just four years ago, New York Times said Bilderberg
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:21.780]  does not exist, and that I'm a full on schizophrenic, imagining Bilderberg in Virginia. Really,
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:26.160]  now it's all over the British press again. Now it's all admitted, now people brag they
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.000]  go since we blew its cover and go, it's no big deal.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.280]  Now it is secret, and we'll try to arrest any reporters that try to get near. But it's
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:40.440]  no big deal, Mr. Gopher. Caddy Shack says, yeah, it's no big deal. Maybe we can find
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:47.440]  that clip where Bill Murray's dropping the plastic explosive in. Just a friendly squirrel,
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:53.000]  Mr. Gopher, not a plastic explosive or anything. I mean, they're changing laws to take your
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  bank accounts and announcing it. What's wrong with having your bank account taken by a foreign
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  bank?
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.800]  What's wrong with Bank of America? It's really a foreign bank, taking people's houses they
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:09.120]  don't even have deeds to that are paid for. I mean, it's no big deal, Mr. Gopher. I mean,
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:14.580]  come on. But speaking of comedy, cuz it's unintentional comedy, here is the Attorney
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.760]  General yesterday saying, I don't know, I don't know. There's only some of the I don't
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:23.960]  know. I know nothing. Here it is. Do you know why that was not done? There are exceptions
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:30.080]  to that rule. I do not know. However, again, Mr. Chairman, I don't know. I don't know.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:36.920]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know that. I don't know.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.080]  I just don't know. I don't know whether or not. I just don't know. I don't know exactly
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:45.600]  how IRS has constructed it. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, I don't know when the subpoena was issued.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:52.080]  Well, I don't know precisely. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know the specific questions
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.320]  again. I don't know what happened. Well, either you know, or you don't know. I don't know.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:02.200]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know when I don't know. I'm not
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.400]  from I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. All right. I did not know. I don't
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.360]  know what you all are going to ask me. I didn't know. I technically I don't know. I don't
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:20.280]  know. I know nothing. I have seen nothing. I was not even here. I mean, this is so in
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:24.880]  your face, ladies and gentlemen. Now I want to go to a clip of Mike Judge as some more
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:29.720]  humor here. Again, the fact that Mike Judge who is obviously a libertarian type guy from
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:35.320]  King of the Hill and the messages that are in that I'd always suspected this.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.160]  I've talked to him, you know, over the years here and there over the phone and text messages
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.120]  and we have a lot of mutual friends. But I interviewed Mike Judge a few a few days ago,
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:47.960]  about a 50 minute interview raw. You know, there's phones ringing and stuff in the background,
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:53.480]  so it'll be about 45 minutes long. We're going to premiere it next Thursday in one of the
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.480]  three hours.
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.920]  If there's big breaking news, it'll be in the third hour. If there's not a bunch of
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:00.240]  breaking news, it'll be in the second hour. But we're going to premiere that here on the
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:08.040]  radio slash TV radio for all the listeners on XM and over 150 affiliates out there. But
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.520]  you can also go to prison planet TV if you're a member and see the video.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.760]  But the little trailer with us, I'm about to play your radio listener. You can see the
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:23.160]  video of it up on Infowars.com. It just went up there. Comedy icon Mike Judge talks to
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.200]  Alex Jones. And so this little teaser is up there if you actually want to see the video.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.940]  But you know, the fact that Mike Judge, who I looked into it, does not ever really talk
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.900]  about his views politically openly.
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:38.480]  He did with us and I actually held back. He was saying so much. I didn't want to because
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.680]  they will. They try to keep people that are big Hollywood A-list on a short leash. But
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:49.840]  he's a great, great patriot. Montana slash Texan, a nice mix there. But let's go to Mike
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:55.000]  Judge, who, well, is a rocket scientist and one of, literally, and one of the greatest
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.880]  comedic minds ever.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:01.880]  And he agreed with my analysis that he's a satirist. So let's go to a little teaser of
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:07.120]  the Mike Judge interview coming up next Thursday, seven days from now on this transmission.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.120]  Here it is.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:18.920]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.920]  Yeah, Infowars.com.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:30.120]  Mike Judge, what is the secret of the universe?
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:38.840]  There were people literally on the YouTube going, I can do a better Beavis and Budhead.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.920]  I can do a better Hank Hill. That's how dumb some YouTubers are. People are like, hey,
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:48.080]  that's the originator. There's no way you can do it better than him. I mean, I can do
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:52.120]  a Bill Clinton, but I'm not Bill Clinton. Got it? Let's go out with the new White House
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:20:03.720]  press secretary. Here it is.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:33.600]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.280]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:42.280]  the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:46.760]  outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold

[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.280]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:08.960]  afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably haven't heard
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.660]  about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:18.800]  most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:24.800]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:29.480]  may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America. But
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:35.360]  here's some good news. There's an underground video at Exposed123.com that thousands of
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:40.680]  smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:45.920]  at Exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.280]  everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:24:11.000]  at Exposed123.com before it's too late. Again, that's Exposed123.com.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:22.040]  Hello, Mr. Golfer. Yeah, it's me, Mr. Squirrel. Yeah, hi. Just a harmless squirrel, not a
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:25.800]  plastic explosive or anything, nothing to be worried about. I'm just here to make your
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:31.240]  last hour as under as peaceful as possible. Yes, don't mind this. This is a doctor's order.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:36.440]  You don't mind if I just pop in there and do laughs, huh? Yeah, that's right. Well,
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:57.920]  in the words of Jean-Claude Sartre, au revoir, good pair. What's up, Doc?
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:06.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, if the gopher is scared of the plastic explosive, he is a conspiracy
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.720]  theorist. They're setting up cameras, buying armored vehicles, millions of bullets. The
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:16.520]  training manual say they're preparing to put us in, quote, reeducation camps, official
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.520]  army manuals.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:22.360]  I can put it on screen for you if you like, or just type in a new army manual, covers
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.080]  reeducation camps, how to break our families up. It says who they're gonna put in there,
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:31.920]  tea party people. And the IRS is targeting us, and they're running torture camps all
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:37.120]  over the world. Everything's fine, Mr. Gopher, not a plastic explosive or anything, nothing
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.600]  to worry about, Mr. Squirrel in your last hours on Earth.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.600]  I mean, the tyranny is here. And I say the gopher is a conspiracy theorist. He should
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.800]  have gone and hugged the plastic explosive, even though he looked through the window and
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.120]  saw the greenskeeper with the explosives talking about his plan to blow up the gopher. Even
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.760]  though the globalists have got all these public documents, it's on record they ship in the
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760]  drugs.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.520]  It's on record they launder the money, it's on record. They had congressional hearings
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.760]  in 97 with this inspector general, the CIA, admitting it. But we're just supposed to go,
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:15.320]  nothing to worry about, Mr. Gopher. Now joining us for the balance of the hour is Kevin Booth.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.080]  And folks, he's really here because he was a producer for Bill Hicks. We're just gonna
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:23.560]  go come clean. He says everybody on the Internet's exposed us. We're running scared right now.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:29.480]  Folks, I am Bill Hicks. And I joked the other day and said that, and people said he accidentally
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.480]  said it.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:34.400]  Accidentally just said it again right there. And it's actually kind of mean to the family,
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:41.680]  folks. Bill really did die of pancreatic cancer. And that's not why Kevin Booth is here. He's
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:46.000]  here to talk about American drug war too. I just wanna be honest with folks, actually,
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  Kevin Booth is Bill Hicks. And Sam Kennison, he was good friends with him as well.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.880]  And folks, Richard Pryor didn't die. I'm gonna be honest, I'm not Bill Hicks. I'm Richard
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:02.480]  Pryor, okay? I'm like Michael Jackson, they took the pigment out of my skin. And I'm Richard
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:09.620]  Pryor, folks. I'm also St. Jerome, George Carland, and a Vatican assassin.
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:13.600]  So you're gonna talk about American drug war too, which actually wasn't produced by you,
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.960]  it was produced by Bill Hicks. Kevin, do you wanna come clean with the fact of how you
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.000]  were the mastermind producer behind my transformation?
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.440]  Well, even though both of you guys are still alive at the same time-
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.840]  I'm too plopped to occur too.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.920]  We started the plastic surgery out of the porta potty at the public access station.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.360]  We had our team of plastic surgeons-
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.360]  Sorry.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:42.280]  Behind the porta potty in the dumpster back there making the transformation.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.720]  But I'm sure you have sacredcalproductions.com. I'm sure you're, I mean, this has been going
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.280]  on for years now, man. They're digging through my birth records and stuff to prove I'm Bill
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.280]  Hicks.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:55.880]  Yeah, no, I was amazed. I went on YouTube the other day and searched it, and there's
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.480]  hundreds of videos now. So it's definitely, it's taking off. It's taking off.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.000]  But it's mean to the family. It's mean to the family.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.800]  Yeah, I know, I know, I know. What do you, I don't know.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.960]  And then when you got Russell Crowe calling you up asking if you're really Bill Hicks,
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:18.040]  you know it's gone too far. I can't handle it, man. I'm living in a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.560]  I'm sorry. You want to address me as Bill now, Kevin?
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.560]  All right, Billy.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.480]  No, but doesn't it kind of make you mad being good friends with Bill and being there when
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.560]  he died to hear all this?
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:32.240]  You know, what makes me mad are just some of the people out there that aren't real crazy
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.920]  about you. Like some of the Bill fans that are not so crazy about you that are saying,
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:41.720]  you know, Kevin owes us some sort of-
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:45.360]  They cut the feed right there. They didn't want us to hear the Bill Hicks thing. That
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.920]  was us cutting the feed. Kevin, your audio cut out. Say that again. Bill Hicks fans say
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.640]  what? My fans say what?
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.240]  You know, I just get a lot from like the Bill Hicks fans that aren't all that crazy about
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:03.040]  you always saying, well, Kevin Booth owes us some sort of an explanation for his association
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.160]  with Alex.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.760]  But I'm Bill. I mean, well, how would you not keep associating with me?
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.940]  I know they've got the eye scanning to prove it. They've got they can prove it. They've
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:17.520]  got everything they've got. The one guy, the one guy goes into detail. He's like, put your
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:23.200]  eyes over each other. Anybody out there, just go to YouTube and just do Bill Hicks is Alex
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.640]  Jones and you'll see all these videos.
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.020]  Well, you know, we're getting desperate. We're getting desperate is why we're while we're
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.640]  talking about this, right? This is damage control, Kevin.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:35.360]  Yeah. All right, folks. Now, for the family, I'm not going to I'm not going to joke around
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:41.360]  about this. I'm not Bill Hicks. OK. I'm actually Bill Clinton's son. All right. We're going
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:46.040]  to be. No, it's it's true, folks. Absolutely. We're gonna get serious. Get into the drug

[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:36.520]  next hour as I got shown late. Larry Pinkney, one of the founders of the Black Panther Party
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:41.040]  is going to be in studio with us. He's also gonna be on the nightly news tonight and we're
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:45.760]  here interviewing him for a film I'm making. But congratulations on American drug war being
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.200]  I've seen it in a lot of newspapers cited as something that's really exposed the drug
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:53.360]  wars, the fraud it is aired on a lot of the big cable networks, big hit American drug
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:58.320]  war to people that have seen it say it is a unrivaled masterpiece and blows the first
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:33:59.320]  one away.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:03.840]  I mean, we probably are six, seven years. Correct me if I'm wrong in the making of this.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.820]  I know that is when you really want to make a real film. You just get obsessed with it.
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:12.240]  You moved out to L.A. to really cover the drug war more closely to make American drug
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.880]  war two. I think you told me he's been picked up by Warner Brothers. It's gonna be in select
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:20.440]  theaters across the country. Very important to be a hit in theaters so it gets expanded
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:21.700]  everywhere.
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:27.360]  But this gets into what it does to children, American drug war two. And so we will be breaking
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:33.680]  that down and playing some exclusive video audio clips never before seen here today ahead
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:37.560]  of its release. We're gonna get into that. But since we bring up Bill Hicks, talk about
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.500]  growing up a little bit briefly with Bill Hicks being his first producer with stuff
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.760]  like Ninja Bachelor Party and so much more.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.760]  And then, of course, you told me the story privately. I think it's also in the best selling
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:52.440]  book that came out later about being there the day he died of pancreatic cancer. I'm
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:57.200]  not afraid to die, but I've got so much work I want to do. And Bill had so much work. He
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:58.200]  was so young.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.680]  I'm just a few minutes on Bill Hicks, remembering him.
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:05.320]  OK, God, I never know what to expect to come on when I come on here. You're all serious.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:11.080]  Then you get all funny on me. It's like a roller coaster ride. You know, I mean, that's
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:15.240]  an interesting thing, because, I mean, you're going 100 miles an hour. And basically, Bill
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:20.240]  was never a guy that wasted any time. And when he would be around people that wasted
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.800]  his time or just wanted to hang out, he would usually like bolt and go do his own thing.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:30.240]  He was trying to achieve things. But definitely once Bill was diagnosed with cancer, instead
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:34.800]  of running around and telling everybody, he didn't want people to feel sorry for him.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:38.320]  And he didn't want people to coddle him. And he definitely didn't want his life to slow
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:44.080]  down. So he kept it a complete secret, even from me for a long time, and basically just
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:49.240]  cranked up the volume. And he got as much done as possible before he passed away. And
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.640]  the whole time when he was sick, you know, it was believed he was going to pull through.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.460]  I mean, you know, we're all praying for this miracle. And for a while, the tumor markers
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:01.440]  were looking better. But we literally, he got sick while we were working on an album
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:05.560]  called Arizona Bay in my home studio. It was an album where we were doing music and comedy
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:11.520]  together. And we did Rant and E-minor while he was sick. We worked on a brand new Ninja
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:16.640]  Bachelor party. We did a bunch of TV shows and interviews. And we were working on a pilot
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:23.200]  for a TV show for Channel 4 in England called Council of the Netherworld. And so Bill, even
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.640]  though he was extremely sick, probably in a lot of pain, he was just running to the
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:33.960]  finish line and knowing that this was going to be the legacy that he left behind on earth,
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:35.640]  whatever that was.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:41.880]  Incredible. Amazing comedian, amazing political mind. It's just a ride. All right, Kevin,
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.540]  shifting gears into your film. I'm going from memory. Am I right? Seven years you've spent
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:48.000]  on American drug war two.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.920]  Well, I mean, you know, I've been I've been on this topic now for about 10 years. I mean,
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:55.760]  just kind of like you with the police state, you know, you keep making the same movie and
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.220]  over and over again until you get it right. You know, we did American drug war one, which
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:05.600]  covered all the aspects of the drug war from the Ricky Ross, CIA crack cocaine to the crystal
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:13.120]  meth epidemic to private prisons and how they operate up into touching on medical marijuana.
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:16.400]  Then we put out another film called How We Won the West, which is a little bit more of
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:21.360]  a playful film showing like the business of marijuana in California and what the future
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:25.600]  of business could be. And really back there in 2009, everybody was thinking like, this
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.640]  is it. It's going to be legalized. Well, things have really gone downhill since then. We've
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:33.600]  got another initiative here in California, Prop D that we're supposedly supposed to be
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:39.480]  voting on. And so we've gone from having 1000 dispensaries in L.A. down to like 130 legally
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:44.440]  operated ones. And so, you know, I just got back from Denver. Now, if you want to be a
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:49.180]  pothead, go to Denver. Like they don't even smoke marijuana anymore. Everybody smokes
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:54.440]  this thing called dabs now. It's funny. They finally legalized marijuana. And now marijuana
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.920]  is not good enough for them anymore. It's all about this dabbing thing, which is like
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:02.440]  this really hardcore, powerful stuff. I'm sure I'm going to get some people complaining
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.000]  that I said that, but it just seems like, you know, how high can you get? But Denver,
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.280]  Denver has gone to pot in a good way. It was fun. It's fun. But if you want to like just
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:16.120]  go crazy and smoke pot, move to Denver for sure. But yeah, I mean, marijuana didn't used
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:20.000]  to be as strong as it is now. It's like horse tranquilizers now or something. Well, you
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.400]  know, but but the point of that is, though, is that really the stronger it gets, the less
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.160]  you need to smoke. And so if the complaint is, is that smoking things is bad for you,
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.760]  which it is, smoking anything is not good for you, then the less you smoke, the better.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.480]  So you know, people argue, well, this isn't your this isn't your parents would stock marijuana
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:40.200]  anymore in there. That's why it should be against the law. Well, but the point is, back
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:45.280]  in the day, somebody would have to smoke 10 joints rival the high you get from one bong
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:51.400]  hit of some of this, especially if you're vaping with Willie Nelson. Yeah. Or dabbing.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:55.880]  Look up dabbing. Dabbing is like the next that's the next level. Of course, they nobody
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.280]  could be happy. I was in I was in a club in Denver. I just wanted to take a hit. You know,
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:04.200]  I don't travel with it. And everybody's like, oh, you still smoke flour. Hey, this old guy,
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:10.480]  this old guy still smokes flour. Oh, my God. What an old timer. He doesn't he doesn't dab.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:15.840]  Sorry, I'm sorry. But let's get into the film because it shows what this does to kids. Right.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:20.000]  So off the bat, I mean, you know, to start, I wanted to not start directly on marijuana.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.880]  And, you know, my wife and I try tried to have children for many years and haven't been
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:29.520]  able to have children. And so we decided to become foster parents here in Los Angeles.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.080]  And when we didn't do this as part of the film, it just is one of these things that
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.000]  became and I've been accused of doing this for the film. But we actually can't respond
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.240]  to trolls, Kevin. I mean, you like adopt a bunch of shelter dogs. The truth is, is that
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.960]  those were the babies who everybody's maternal. And so now you want to take care of real humans
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:50.720]  and it's good you all take care of all the dogs. So, you know, here in Los Angeles County
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:54.520]  alone, there's thirty five thousand children that have been taken away from their parents
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:00.120]  in these horrible group homes and foster homes. And it's a business. The business becomes
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.980]  how many children can you stick in one home to make as much money? And so this is really
[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:08.920]  a CPS film is why it's so powerful. That's why I'm surprised they've picked it up. Get
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:14.040]  into that. What you discovered being involved in this. Well, you know, right off the bat,
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:18.360]  right before Christmas, not this last Christmas, but the Christmas before we had a younger
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:23.440]  11 year old girl named Stephanie brought to our home and she was going to spend Christmas
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:29.960]  with us. Seemed like a totally normal, rational child. And then comes like all these bottles
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:34.760]  of pills and they say, OK, you got to give her these in the morning and these at night.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:40.800]  And and it's, you know, Adderall. And we come to realize that she has to be basically given
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:45.320]  amphetamines in the morning and then barbiturates at night. And she just came from a group home
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:51.400]  where all the all the kids in this one group home were on the same exact regimen of barbiturates
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.400]  and amphetamines.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:57.740]  And it's basically just a way of chemically controlling a group. It's like a chemical
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:00.880]  straitjacket. By the way, about 20 percent of our military is now they're doing that
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.840]  to him, too. I mean, this is this is T H X one one three eight. Yeah, no, it's it's unbelievable.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.400]  And so we we you know, and the thing was, we were put into a position of if we didn't
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.720]  give her the medication, they would remove her from us because they're, you know, screening
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.120]  her and testing her constantly while she is with us.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.240]  And you discovered they do this to all of them, basically, because they get more money.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:26.240]  Yeah. Well, basically, what you find out in the foster system very quickly is that the
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:31.340]  higher like the more problems your kid has, the more money you can make and the more money
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:35.720]  all the social makers, social workers make and all the everybody involved.
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:39.360]  So you're a successful writer, filmmaker, you know, I'm not going to brag, but you know,
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:44.240]  you live in a famous guy's former house, a nice place. You don't need this for the money.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.620]  You know, you know, three wolves and five dogs isn't enough. You're you're paternal.
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:52.280]  You want to take care of some young people. We're just trying to help a kid. You know
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:56.240]  what I mean? We're just trying to help a kid and experience something that we hadn't experienced
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.920]  before and then jumping into raising a teenager with a lot of problems is a lot to bite off
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.920]  already.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:08.320]  But, you know, we went through quite a bit to get her get them the court order to to
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.360]  lower the amount of Adderall. And here's something I'd like to say. And I know this is probably
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:18.320]  extremely irresponsible thing to say. And a lot of it's probably a bad thing to say.
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.360]  A lot of people are going to disagree with me. But I believe that anybody who's going
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.360]  to give mind altering drugs to a little child should have to take them first themselves.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:30.600]  I think that's a great thing. You know what? You know what? I just don't think you should
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:34.600]  hand Paxil to some little kid and then wonder why he's like trying to tear his hair out.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:40.320]  Why don't you take it first? And then maybe it makes sense. Or, you know, I took one little
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.640]  speck of this Adderall and I thought I was going to have a heart attack.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:48.160]  I'm not kidding you. And this was just like not even a crumb of what this little child
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:53.480]  was taking every day. Oh, my God. And then it makes them calm later. Once they burn out,
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:58.640]  it kills brain cells. And they usually ends up making them want to become addicted to
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:00.840]  speed twice.
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:03.720]  You know, in high school, people would talk me into it whenever did hard drugs. I tried
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.880]  it was like I'm up for two days, then I vomit for another day. And I want to like basically
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:11.720]  get in fistfights with people. I mean, this is hellish.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:16.560]  Yeah, no. And when it carves out of place in your brain, that is going to basically
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:22.840]  make you an addict later in life because you study four times more likely to be a drug
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.040]  addict after they put you on this stuff. Yeah. So they know what they're doing. Seventy percent
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:30.080]  roughly of foster kids are on are on up to seven drugs.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:33.200]  But get into the film. We've got some clips. What clips you want to go to first? Well,
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:36.480]  let's start the one about foster children before we get into talking about marijuana.
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:42.700]  So the this first clip is just like a minute and a half or so about my wife and I fostering
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:47.120]  this child. And and then her. It also has her sister in there who was taken to another
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.920]  group home. But we knew her sister, too. And out of out of the blue, because she tried
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.120]  to like they drowned another girl in a pool when they were just playing in a swimming
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:01.500]  pool and she held someone else's little girl in water. They diagnosed her as being schizophrenic
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:04.200]  and put her on all these powerful schizophrenia medications.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:08.040]  Just never, you know, never in her whole life had been, you know, you're an expert on that
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.360]  because you took care of your late brother. It was schizophrenic. Yeah, she was not. She's
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:16.080]  not schizophrenic. I mean, maybe she has some emotional problems. Who wouldn't? Well, putting
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:22.280]  kids on speed will make them become what artificially schizophrenic. Everybody knows that. Well,
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:24.200]  what about just taking a child away from their parents?
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.720]  I think taking a child away from their parents, like what child is not going to be traumatized
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:34.520]  from that? It's a completely traumatic experience. And and so they started handing these kids
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:37.200]  drugs. And by the way, since you raised this point, I didn't even know about it. We've
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.120]  talked about the film. I've had people have seen it out in L.A.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:45.240]  The rough cuts. You know, you bring up what trolls say about, oh, he put a foster kid
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.840]  now that, you know, she's gone back to her mother. You've got an authorization to put
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:51.240]  her in the film. He put her in the film. He did this to put her in a film. I remember
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:57.320]  the last six, seven years, all the incarnations about prisons and enslaving and marijuana.
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:00.600]  And then I remember you telling me now I'm going this direction because I discovered
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:05.420]  all this. Oh, my God, you're right. It's all true. It's so horrible. In fact, you even
[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:09.680]  told me a few months ago, you said you didn't fully believe me about the CPS and stuff before.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:15.920]  No, it's it's crazy. But the thing is, is that when you get into it, you know, it's
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.340]  not like any of these people are evil. I mean, we I mean, we have these people in my house
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:24.280]  all the time. I'm friends with a lot of these people. We have caseworkers and social workers
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.520]  and county workers. I mean, the foster child we're taking care of now, she's 16 years old.
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:34.980]  I'm not kidding you, Alex. She has twenty, twenty people that work for her. It is insane.
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:39.720]  We go to these meetings where, like, it's literally like 20, 20 people around a table
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:44.640]  that, you know, I'm the intern for her social workers, you know, management company. And
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.800]  they're all making money off this one child. And so the more problems, too, is like, oh,
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:51.120]  she lost her temper. We got to like up her level of care.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.200]  Oh, they're at a pool and a little kid fell off and went under, tried to murder him that
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:59.800]  we're going to put you on an antipsychotic. Exactly. It's that fast. Is that fast? I mean,
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:04.880]  they just they don't even question it. OK, so what's this first clip we're going to play?
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:12.020]  Yeah, this is about us fostering this little girl and we interview her, her, her sister
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:17.680]  as well. And just for the record, you know, her mother has become an activist. She's back
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.000]  with her mother now. And it's all good. And they believe me, they want to be in this.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.160]  And by the way, that's what you've worked to do is get them back with their parents.
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:30.680]  You're telling me, can you say what you told me off record about how. I mean, the system
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.000]  doesn't really want kids back with their parents, do they?
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.800]  Yeah, no, they fight. And, you know, we even get messages about like how bad they're doing
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.920]  all the time. And then we check in with them and they're like, no, we're doing good. And
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:44.840]  it's kind of like it's the system doesn't want you. Look, folks, they take people's
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:49.120]  kids that fall off jungle gyms and break their finger at school.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:53.480]  And then they start an investigation at the hospital and then come to your house and find
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:58.440]  a dirty plate and take your kid for that when the kid breaks their finger at the school.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.400]  I know someone that happened with. Let's go to this clip. Here it is.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.920]  If I wanted to become a foster dad, I was no longer allowed to use my homegrown remedy.
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:13.080]  Weekly searches of our home by seasoned California caseworkers with sensitive noses kept me on
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:18.280]  the up and up. Weren't allowed to smoke pot.
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:22.440]  Right before Christmas, the agency sent my wife and I, an 11 year old girl whose mother
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:27.140]  had been in prison for several years. Along with our new foster daughter, Stephanie, came
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:31.840]  prescriptions for the powerful amphetamine Adderall and a very powerful antidepressant
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:36.880]  sleeping pill. Before becoming our foster daughter, Stephanie had been living in a home
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:42.040]  with 10 other children for over three years. Wow. During that time, she was regularly sedated
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:47.140]  and put to bed by 7 p.m. and then woken up at 6 a.m. with Adderall in order to go to
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:50.160]  school, as were most of the other children living in the home.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:53.720]  You saved a victim. Newly diagnosed as being schizophrenic and
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.280]  drugged accordingly, Stephanie's sister, Brittany, was also placed in foster care.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:04.520]  I started the medication in the group home, but before I had the medication, I was good.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:10.520]  I was good, but then I don't know what happened and they just put me on medication.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:16.400]  As foster parents, the more problems we could list our child with, the more we got paid.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:21.160]  If a child throws something or makes a threatening gesture, we could raise their category of
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:26.040]  care. More drugs for the child equals more money for everyone, including the agencies,
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:30.280]  doctors, and on a grand scale, the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:36.000]  We don't drug our children. We raise our children and nurture them and take care of them. But
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.880]  the institutions that they end up in do it just to keep the log jam from getting worse,
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:47.680]  you know. I'm 11 years old and I feel kind of sad being
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:53.360]  taken away from my mom. And I didn't know it would be like that. And I've been in foster
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:58.880]  care for so long. I just I'm ready to go home. Wow. You know, Kevin, you've got you're doing
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:02.720]  something no one's ever done. And I think there's a reason you obsessed over this film
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:07.720]  for it's been seven years. The other one took three. This is seven and or six and a half.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:11.400]  And I mean, you really stumbled into something big here. And the fact that you're able to
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:18.040]  show this is just amazing. Yeah, I know it's it's taken some some time.
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.680]  You know, you have to put in the time to do a story like this. I mean, you know, we couldn't
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:25.600]  have just put this out while the girls were still in the foster system. We had to make
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:29.360]  sure that these girls got out of the foster system before we could tell the story. And
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:34.640]  so it was, you know, it was a three year plan just before and after I've seen like three
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.720]  year olds grabbed by the foster system.
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:40.340]  Totally healthy, happy. Six months later, their teeth have fallen out. They have black
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:43.880]  circles around their eyes. They look like concentration camp victims because you cried
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:48.840]  for mommy. They put you on drugs. Oh, yeah. And the average foster home is not like our
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:52.340]  house. I mean, we're we're the you know, I'm not sitting here bragging saying we got some
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:53.340]  great house.
[01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:58.800]  But he's like the average foster home. They got a nice pad. But the whole point is I listen
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.800]  for a summer. I worked for a major carpet cleaner. And this is when I was 18 and my
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.240]  dad's like, get out of the house and get another job. You know, I don't care if you don't have
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.720]  enough of the one job, get two jobs.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.000]  You're not going to be, you know, that's good. You'll throw you out of the nest. And I got
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.120]  that job because it was a place where I could get paid 15 bucks an hour back then because
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.680]  it was rough work. You know, the apprentice got paid like 15. They had guys like 25. You'd
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:23.800]  be there helping. And let me tell you, I had to go to the foster houses. I'm like, what
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:29.480]  are these? And it'd be like some three bedroom house with kids that you'd see like cages
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.720]  where they were locking them up.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.400]  A dirty mattress. Kids that look like zombies. It would always be like some weird pot bellied
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.760]  guy that, you know, now I know probably like a pedophile was, you know, wandering around
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.840]  and then they won't investigate them because that's their people. And I know, you know,
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:49.760]  and they've passed a little test. Yeah. Cops out there. You get to go in houses, you know,
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:53.960]  and plumbers. Let me tell you, it's service people that see all this stuff, man. And I
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:59.320]  mean, let me tell you, fleas. We'll be right back with Kevin. Kevin both. Absolutely.

[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:05.880]  last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:10.640]  and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:14.960]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:19.420]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:24.360]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control

[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:20.080]  Folks, I go covering news for years. Locally in Austin would have families contact me and
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:26.220]  I would go and see the CPS take their newborn baby for no reason and file it with the county
[01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:30.900]  clerk with different names and a three-year-old filing.
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:36.220]  Just so lazy, the social workers I saw, that I would go to court and it would be a different
[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:42.600]  name on the paperwork. And they abused the three-year-old. And I'd be there in court
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:46.620]  not allowed to talk and people be like, they'd have a public defender in the fake court.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:51.480]  It's not even a real court, not a jury, family court. I actually saw this happen. I showed
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.840]  these documents on access TV, this is like 16 years ago.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.840]  And one of the cases, I'm having flashbacks to this cuz it was such a wake-up call. And
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:04.520]  they would go, because you abused the three-year-old and it'd be someone else's name, we're taking
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:10.520]  this one. And they'd go, who is my first child? They'd go, psychiatric evaluation, psychiatric
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:15.040]  evaluation. And I mean, it would just take their kid cuz it was blonde hair, blue eyes
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:16.860]  and they could get top dollar.
[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:20.080]  And I don't know about the LA system, I've read it's pretty darn bad as well, they're
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:25.560]  in Southern California. But they've had the doctors over CPS go public over the kids dying
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:33.000]  for the medications. And it is a Holocaust, folks, and I know so much about it. It frustrates
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.360]  me, because how do I explain it all to you if you haven't been a carpet cleaner for three
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:41.000]  months and seen it?
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.280]  You have and the creepiness of it. And then you don't wanna attack all foster parents
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:51.680]  cuz a lot of them are good Christian people or liberals, real liberals like Kevin Booth
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:55.640]  and Trey Booth, his wife, who I've known for many years are really just big sweetie pies
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:57.920]  who love to take care of injured animals and stuff.
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:02.440]  I'm always like, no, they found another hurt possum in the yard. Now they're nursing the
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:06.500]  possum back to life, come over there with possums and raccoons, they're nursing back
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:10.560]  to life. So they wanted to help young people. And then they found out about this and I wanna
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:15.320]  commend you for your courage, Kevin. What's the next clip we're gonna premiere here on
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:16.320]  air for folks?
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:20.040]  Well, thanks. Well, we're gonna circle back into the about children and cancer here. But
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:25.960]  real quick, I just wanted to talk about that in 2003, the US government actually obtained
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:32.120]  the patent for medical marijuana in the form of the Department of Health and Human Services
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:35.440]  patenting cannabinoids.
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:40.220]  And this is gonna lead into a thing that there is a Canadian man named Rick Simpson that
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:46.760]  discovered a age old version of cannabis oil that cured his own cancer. And after he cured
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:51.640]  his cancer and thousands of other people's cancer with this ancient cannabis oil, he
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:57.080]  had to flee Canada because they raided him. And now a lot of people are trying to work
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:00.280]  to get this into the modern day pharmacopeia.
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:04.880]  And this brings up the main character. The main character in American Drug War Two is
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:11.380]  a little boy named Cashy Hyde. And in the movie, I'm not gonna give any spoiler alerts
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:17.240]  here on your show because I want people to go see the film on 2006. But he basically
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:23.720]  was in a coma for 40 days with a peanut-sized brain tumor. The hospital staff told the parents,
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:28.600]  Mike Hyde and Callie Hyde, to make funeral arrangements. And Mike had been reading about
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:33.800]  this cannabis oil on the internet. And they snuck in, his wife is actually a registered
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:39.080]  nurse, they snuck in some syringes of the cannabis oil into the emergency room in Salt
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:44.740]  Lake City and started injecting it into their dying son's feeding port, just into his feeding
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:45.740]  port.
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:50.200]  And literally in a day, he pops out of the coma and he starts eating. And then the tumor
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:52.880]  shrinks and that's kind of where our story starts.
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:57.520]  And Tommy Chong says he drank the oil and it made his, and it is years later, made his
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.520]  cancer go away.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:02.080]  Right, so this next little clip I wanna show right now is kind of called Rediscovering
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.080]  the Oil.
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:06.680]  We're gonna have you on for 20 more minutes and we're gonna have our guest, Mr. Pinckney

[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:38.200]  it first. Very important film. It's really a CPS drugging the kid film. Very important.

[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:34.680]  All right, award-winning filmmaker Kevin Booth is our guest. Larry Pink is coming in at 20
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:38.720]  after. The next segment, we're going to play three or four other exclusive clips here with
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:48.120]  people recovering from cancer with cannabis oil, the CPS drugging kids with deadly drugs.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.840]  Just inside seven year, really it's a ten year investigation, but he put out American
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:57.160]  Drug War, the first one in like four years and now this will be six, seven years on this
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:58.160]  one.
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:01.240]  And Kevin Bush, our guest right now, next segment, those clips are coming up. We're
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:05.640]  gonna talk about world news and events with Larry Pinkney coming up as well. Kevin, well,
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:09.640]  what are other points people need to know about the process of seven years making a
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:15.040]  film and the different stages it went through, different things you look at in the film?
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:24.000]  Well, I mean, the process is basically just going out into the world and just having relationships
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.680]  with people and then these relationships take time. And everything, just like a fine wine,
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:38.240]  it has to go through its natural process. And films like these, they just can't be rushed.
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:42.720]  I mean, like the thing about fostering the girls, we couldn't just turn around and stick
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:46.320]  that out on the internet. We would have gotten them in trouble. We would have gotten in trouble.
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:52.440]  We would have lost them. So there just has to be a process to that. And also in this
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:58.320]  movie, we follow this young boy fighting cancer for two years. And so we watch a two year
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:04.320]  film, a two year rollercoaster ride in the film. So some time goes by on this thing.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:10.540]  And it's just been an evolution of doing this. I also go out and I do lectures all across
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:15.560]  the country at different universities. And so just getting to talk to kids about this
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:20.040]  and what their feelings are. And I guess I've tried to make myself a little bit of an expert
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:26.000]  in the field. And that's why I just keep staying on the topic of drugs.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.840]  It's really incredible what you've been able to put together. We're going to break here
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:33.000]  in a few minutes, but what are the next four clips? And we already talked about one, clip
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  number two, we're going to play coming up. Then you've got a bunch of other clips we're
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.160]  going to be premiering here today. Tell people about some of what's coming up.
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:47.040]  Well, the next clip is about rediscovering cannabis oil. And it just talks about this
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:52.180]  basically how just 100 years ago, this cannabis oil was in every doctor's black bag. And because
[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:57.440]  of the drug war, how it's been demonized and that people are being refused this incredible
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:03.600]  medicine, and how the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies are set up to where you can't patent
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:08.440]  a plant. And so therefore, what they're trying to do, and you've got the Department of Health
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:13.080]  and Human Services now has gotten the patent to cannabinoids. And this should worry people
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:16.560]  because what a lot of people believe they're going to do now is they're going to start
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:22.000]  stripping the plant down and trying to just patent just like little various things. So
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.040]  you'll have to buy this one spray to get this one aspect of the marijuana plant. You'll
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:31.240]  have to take this one pill to get that aspect of it instead of just being able to consume
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:33.840]  the one natural plant and get everything is-
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:39.280]  They're also talking about GMO-ing it and only allowing you to have the GMO and then
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:45.280]  banning everything else, of course. We just lost-
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:46.560]  Mixing it up out there.
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:49.800]  Yeah, yeah, your audio's cutting out a bit. We're going to go to break, Kevin. No, no,
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:51.880]  we got another minute. What were you trying to say?
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:55.400]  I said a lot of people already believe that the GMO strains are already being mixed in
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:02.000]  with all the really high-end seeds. So that conspiracy has been going along for a long
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.160]  time now that people believe that the GMO is already-
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:09.840]  By the way, you visited the big Emerald Triangle too. I mean, is that going to be in the film?
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:13.880]  No, that's in the last film. I try to keep it all fresh. So I'm trying to cover things
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:21.540]  that this new film is mostly based on children. We went to Juarez, Mexico. We go to a neighborhood
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:27.000]  where little boys are being recruited at $40 a pop to commit murders for cartels.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:30.840]  Yeah, you have a lot of courage. I knew you did that. You're crazy is what you're-
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:34.960]  Yeah, that was a little crazy.
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:37.480]  You learned how to be crazy from the doc, didn't you?
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:42.680]  Yes, I did. Just keep- Don't turn off the camera. Now, I do know karate, so if the cartel
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:44.080]  started shooting at me, I-
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:47.040]  You could block the bullets like Wonder Woman.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.840]  I've got a green belt from the YMCA, so.
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:54.800]  Well, I mean, we all saw your karate skills, and then's your bachelor party.
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:05:01.280]  You're being green, not too far between. I'll be seeing a drinker of that.
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.880]  With health threats on the rise, such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird

[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:18.640]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show. You know last hour before Kevin Booth got
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:24.600]  on with us I showed how ridiculous it was on TV with Obama with Marines with their white
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:29.040]  gloves. I thought it was absurdist you know holding the umbrellas over them. I'm glad
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:33.680]  Drudge picked up on that himself obviously. I mean look at this. Punch it up for people
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:40.240]  watching on TV. Obama calls in Marines to shield him from rain, fires IRS boss who was
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:46.720]  leaving anyways, complete confidence in Holder. I mean this is just all a criminal organization.
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:53.760]  Staged fast and furious to blame the Second Amendment, everything. And White House Down
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:57.560]  set for summer release all these movies where the White House is getting attacked by people
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:05.560]  so the White House can be seen as this historic heroes. Amazing so that's just some of the
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:14.400]  news. If you go up to infowars.com you can see all the latest news there on the site.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:19.040]  We're going to go back to Kevin Booth here in a moment. A Senate subcommittee investigating
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:24.280]  Apple's offshore tax practices. How about their slave factories in China with a suicide
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:28.960]  net because I thought they were liberal. Police department forced to borrow ammo from local
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:33.920]  residents. I haven't even gotten to that Second Amendment news yet. DC moves to force gun
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:40.760]  owners to buy a prohibitive liability insurance. That is devastating. Comedy icon Mike Judge
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:45.720]  talks to Alex Jones that interview teasers up there with some satire. Pretty powerful.
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:48.440]  Please get that out to everybody. A judge is going to get political in this interview
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:52.320]  coming up next week folks. We taped it two days ago at his house. Google knows when you're
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:59.340]  home key article. Google Berg merger ushers in planned Opelis future for hybrid age. Council
[02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:03.440]  vetoes display of English flag because it's offensive to Muslims. Just all part of the
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:09.940]  balkanization. Obama back rebels carry out public executions. Warning graphic video.
[02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:16.360]  That's just some of what's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com. Now Larry
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:20.320]  Pinkney is coming up for the balance of the hour into some overdrive. Founding member
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:23.240]  of the Black Panther Party. Very interesting fellow. We appreciate him flying all the way
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:28.760]  to Austin, Texas to be here with us for a new film we're making, but it'll also be live
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:32.480]  in studio. Kevin, we got like nine minutes left. What's what's the next clip we're going
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:38.480]  to and we're going to go to it for American drug war two. The one about rediscovering
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:45.400]  cannabis oil. Let's go ahead and roll that now. Beavis Cali and I started sneaking the
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:50.920]  oil into his G tube and they started weaning them off of all those drugs I named off and
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:56.160]  it over a course of two weeks we literally pulled them off of all eight of those medications.
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:11:00.940]  We had him sitting up in bed eating again, laughing. He had a quality of life that wasn't
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:05.500]  possible on the drugs they were given him and the whole time the nurses and the doctors
[02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:10.000]  were saying, God, this is just miraculous. The cash is doing so well. So as all these
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.320]  doctors are saying, God, we don't understand how he survived all of this. This don't make
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:19.160]  any sense to us. I pulled that patent out. The government has on cannabis is a neuro
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:24.080]  protected antioxidant. Does cannabis really have an anti cancer effect? I mean, we've
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:29.220]  seen the work of Tashkin. We've seen the data from the Kaiser cohort. There was an animal
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:35.280]  study that the National Toxicology Program did as well where they fed mice and rats,
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:41.000]  increasing dosages of THC via a tube in their stomach and found at the end of two years
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.480]  that the animals that got the highest dosages actually had fewer tumors, both benign and
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:50.360]  malignant. That's Dr. Donald Abrams. Well, you know, in the early 1900s, John D. Rockefeller
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:54.760]  got together with his rich friends and they started all these medical foundations and
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:59.640]  they took over the medical schools. And all they taught the doctors that were being trained
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:05.260]  is allopathic medicine, medicine from chemicals and poisons. And of course, they owned the
[02:12:05.260 --> 02:12:10.800]  chemical plants and what a great way to sell their products. So they brainwashed the public
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.120]  and all of these doctors into believing that this was the way to go. When in reality, the
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:20.000]  only thing that actually heals is empiric medicine, medicine from plants. And old John
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.800]  D. Rockefeller himself, as I understand it, he lived to be almost a hundred years old
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:28.880]  and he wouldn't even take his own medicine. What he took was empiric medicine, medicine
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:34.040]  from plants. But they didn't mind selling the chemicals to us, did they? The pharmaceutical
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:38.180]  company and the way that they operate, it has to be a molecule, you know, no more than
[02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:42.560]  five molecules, in fact, to make up a drug to get approved through the FDA. Cannabis
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:47.140]  absolutely does not qualify. I think the pharmaceutical company figured out, well, this extremely
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:51.560]  popular plant medicine that everybody could grow in their backyard is not available for
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:57.520]  us to make profit at this time. We have this interesting balance occurring as maturation
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:04.720]  of individuals fulfill their kind of cannabis destiny, whether or not they produce enough
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:10.120]  to be open-minded or closed-minded. And if you look historically at the nature of mankind,
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:15.720]  we've been ruled by people quite clearly that are what I would call unhigh people.
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.600]  Again, Kevin Booth, a patriot, you can hear him going after the Rockefellers in this with
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:25.120]  the history. And this is getting picked up for distribution to be on cable. His other
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:30.380]  stuff has been on what Showtime, you know, HBO, you name it, now getting picked up. It's
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:34.440]  very important. This gets seen in theaters everywhere. Where do people go to see the
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:38.280]  first theaters? Because if it sells out at those theaters, then folks, they'll book it
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:46.320]  in other theaters, just like Obama 2016 and others. Yeah, give people the date, Kevin.
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:53.080]  Yeah, right. It's June 6th. And if you go to AmericanDrugWar2.com or just AmericanDrugWar.com
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:58.320]  or AmericanDrugWar2.com and look for the screenings through a company called TUG out of Austin.
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:01.720]  I want to make sure everybody's at the L.A. screening. Everybody's at the Austin screening
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:06.360]  also be done through Brave New Books. But you got to buy your tickets in advance to
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:11.760]  make sure that the theater books. So I need everybody to get out there and buy tickets
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:14.080]  immediately. That's right. You buy them and if it doesn't book, you get your money back.
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:16.840]  But it's all going to be. Yeah, get your money back. The problem is this is going to sell
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:21.220]  out. Your stuff always sells out. Well, there's theaters all across the country. So go in
[02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:24.880]  there and take you to this Web site and there's theaters all over the Florida and New York.
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:28.840]  We got theaters booked everywhere, but we've got to sell all the tickets or we got to sell
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:32.800]  enough tickets by May 30th. So please get out there and buy the tickets immediately.
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:35.920]  And again, folks, I'm not making any money off of this. I'm doing this because I want
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:39.720]  this film to be a hit because I want to save the children that they're murdering with prescription
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:44.000]  drugs via the CPS. Let's go to the next clip. We're almost out of time. Kevin, tell people
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.280]  the next clip. Just basically the torture that kids are still going through and that
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:53.480]  we're using chemo stuff from the 1970s. This is a continuation of the little cash out story.
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:15:00.880]  There it is. The next clip. Cashy's mom, Callie, is a registered nurse. And although some say
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:12.840]  it's not necessary, she always insists that the oil be sterilized in a professional laboratory.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.560]  Mike shares one of the many regrettable situations that Cashy and many other children with cancer
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:23.520]  commonly endure. They weren't even going to try to remove his infected port till Sunday.
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:29.040]  I had to actually tell them that they were stupid. So every day they had to pull this
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:34.640]  patch off of his chest and they had to pull the gauze stuff into the wound hole that was
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:42.960]  in it. Now that's fighting cancer with the American Cancer Society. That's fighting cancer
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:49.800]  with pediatric oncology floors. This is the answer to all of our prosecutors, sheriffs,
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:54.600]  police officers, governors. This is what they say to be the best way for our kids. It's
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:16:03.680]  all on purpose, folks. I say bullshit. Bleep that. That's torture, man. Have you ever seen
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:09.360]  a person who had cancer and used marijuana to help them eat or to leave their condition
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:18.000]  of somebody suffering from terminal cancer? No, I have not. And if you had and I have
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.160]  and seen that it helps them with their appetite and makes them smile, would you agree that
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:27.100]  it has some benefit to society for somebody who's dying and that marijuana is the only
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:34.160]  thing that makes them eat and makes them smile? Is there not an efficacious situation there?
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:39.000]  I think that's between him and his doctor. Well, if it's between him and his doctor,
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.920]  why does the DEA take a position that medical marijuana is wrong, which you've taken? You've
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:47.620]  taken the position it's not between him and his doctor. You have a publication, which
[02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:55.280]  on page six of your publication in 2011 has the most insane and banal paragraph. The legalization
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:59.680]  movement is not simply a harmless academic exercise. The moral danger of thinking that
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:07.360]  a lot of time has expired. The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Chu. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:12.320]  the cancer viruses are in the vaccine. Pediatric cancer sometimes are up 10,000%. They're killing
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:17.240]  all of us. And because they make money, they give you the cancer and then they go and suck
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:20.520]  all the money out of you while they kill you and your family. And then they'll now take
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:25.720]  your kids and take them and do medical experiments on them. I mean, this is unbelievable, Kevin.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:31.000]  Yeah, I know. And a lot of the footage that you're seeing is saying this was hidden camera
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.840]  footage that the family actually, you know, were filming off their iPhones and so forth
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:38.760]  without the hospital's knowledge. So there's a lot of footage in this movie you're not
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:42.800]  going to see anywhere else. And I think it's very interesting at that hearing too. You
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:48.340]  got the chief of the DEA, Michelle Lienhart, admitting that she doesn't know anything about
[02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:54.240]  cancer and cannabis while you've got 52% of all Americans saying they want it legalized
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:59.280]  and you know what I mean? It's just like Twilight Zone. And the DEA is still pumping out propaganda
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:04.760]  saying that anybody that belongs to the marijuana legalization movement is a domestic terrorist.
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:09.640]  It's amazing. Now, now we've got one more clip here. Let's go ahead and roll that clip
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:16.800]  right now. Here's the final clip. And then we'll get Kevin's comment on there are only
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:22.840]  three groups of which I'm aware that are very interested in keeping marijuana illegal. They're
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:27.020]  the police. A lot of people know about them. And that tends to take the form of chiefs
[02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:34.720]  of police, police unions trying to hold on to overtime pay, prisons, private prison industry.
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:39.720]  The other is cartels because cartels make 70% of their profits from marijuana sales
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:44.720]  alone. I was lucky enough to cross the bridge into Juarez with veteran journalists, Brent
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:50.940]  and Craig Renaud, who report for the New York Times. The battle between the police and the
[02:18:50.940 --> 02:18:54.980]  cartels is really heated up. And the cartels are saying they're going to kill one police
[02:18:54.980 --> 02:19:00.840]  officer every day. And in the last month and a half, they have killed about 19 local police
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:06.320]  officers here. And just last night in this area, two more were killed. The brutally poor
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:11.800]  circumstances of Juarez make many of the children perfect marks for cartel recruitment. If you
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:19.840]  don't want to go into the cartel, they won't force you. They like for you to go by yourself.
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:26.800]  Because if they force you, you can go and tell the police and they will help you sometimes.
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:32.600]  But if you go by yourself, they will ask you to do anything and you will do it. And they
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:39.560]  give you a transponder number to squawk. It's a little off the norm. And so an ATC folks,
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:43.360]  listen, I'll have to hear the rest of this tonight on the nightly news. Thank you, Kevin
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:48.880]  Booth for premiering this year. I congratulate you on your courage and your great work. People
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:54.000]  can find out more at americandrugwar2.com to get these screened all over the country.

[02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:50.200]  that thousands of other smart patriots
[02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:52.240]  have already seen in the last three months.

[02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:14.500]  and the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:17.500]  The interest is up and the stock market's down
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:21.500]  and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:29.500]  There's a big Forbes article out today.
[02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:35.500]  Disarming realities as gun sales soar, gun crimes plummet.
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:37.500]  And of course, we've been hammering on this forever
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:39.500]  and now those statistics are getting out.
[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:43.500]  Hardcore statistics that the system doesn't want you to know about
[02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:44.500]  and the criminals that work for the government
[02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:46.500]  don't want you to know about.
[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:47.500]  Meanwhile, the bullet shortage is so bad,
[02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:51.500]  police chief has citizens for ammo, gets a 1,500-round loan
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:53.500]  amid strong public response.
[02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:57.500]  The evil public up in Minnesota, in Procter, Minnesota.
[02:24:57.500 --> 02:25:01.500]  DC considers quarter-million-dollar insurance policy for gun buyers.
[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:02.500]  Next, it'll be a million.
[02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:06.500]  So if they can't get your guns one way, they'll get them the other.
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:07.500]  That's just some of what we have.
[02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:09.500]  And joining us for the rest of the hour
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:12.500]  and then into some overdrive today is Larry Pinckney
[02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:15.500]  with blackactivistwg.org.
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:20.500]  He also is the editorial board member of blackcommentator.com,
[02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:21.500]  a great news site.
[02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:23.500]  And of course, he is a veteran Black Panther Party.
[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:24.500]  They're at its founding,
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:28.500]  the Foreign Minister of the Interior of the Republic of New Africa,
[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:29.500]  a former political prisoner
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:32.500]  and the only American to have successfully self-offered
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:34.500]  his civil political rights case to the United Nations
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:38.500]  under the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights.
[02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:41.500]  And he, of course, has been a guest on PBS, you name it,
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:43.500]  in documentaries about COINTELPRO,
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:46.500]  how the government targets people with dirty tricks
[02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:50.500]  like having people get behind me and yell,
[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:51.500]  kill Michelle Malkin.
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:53.500]  And the phone rings, and it's the Denver Post
[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:56.500]  and national TV saying, why'd you say killer?
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:58.500]  It was all a setup.
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:01.500]  And luckily, we had video, and it came out it was a setup.
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:03.500]  And then now, with the Austin gun rally,
[02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:07.500]  they had somebody run up and cuss right behind the pro-gun people
[02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:08.500]  to then blame us.
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:09.500]  These are the tactics.
[02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:11.500]  And that's like COINTELPRO.
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:14.500]  Thank you for coming to Austin, Texas.
[02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:16.500]  Larry Pinckney, it's great to have you here.
[02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:17.500]  This is a short segment.
[02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:19.500]  But I asked, I said, what do you want to get into first?
[02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:21.500]  The wars, the scandals, the government running Al-Qaeda?
[02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:24.500]  You go, no, I want to talk about the Second Amendment first.
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:26.500]  And so let's talk about that, Larry Pinckney.
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:29.500]  Well, first of all, I want to thank you very, very much, Alex.
[02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:31.500]  It's a pleasure being here in Austin, Texas.
[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:35.500]  It's a fantastic job that all of you are doing.
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:36.500]  We're trying.
[02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:37.500]  It is fantastic.
[02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:39.500]  So let me just get right into it.
[02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:43.500]  As far as the Second Amendment is concerned,
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:46.500]  that is to say the right to defend ourselves.
[02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:48.500]  We're not just talking about bearing arms.
[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:50.500]  We're saying the right to defend ourselves.
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:54.500]  It was a reason that the Second Amendment came into being.
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:56.500]  It didn't happen by osmosis.
[02:26:56.500 --> 02:27:01.500]  We have to understand that if we are not able to defend ourselves,
[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:04.500]  everyday ordinary black, white, brown, red, yellow people,
[02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:09.500]  American citizens, we are in deep trouble.
[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:14.500]  If the government, for example, the Department of Homeland Security,
[02:27:14.500 --> 02:27:17.500]  which has been gathering munitions, you name it,
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:21.500]  well, who are they going to use those munitions and ammunition against?
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:23.500]  It's not a foreign agency.
[02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:24.500]  It has to be against-
[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:29.500]  The training manuals say it's for anybody that, quote, promotes the Constitution.
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:31.500]  And what does that tell us?
[02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:35.500]  Apparently, it tells us that the Constitution has been made null and void.
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:38.500]  It means anybody that wants a check on unlimited power is the enemy.
[02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:40.500]  Right, right.
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:43.500]  So I wanted to, and I thank you for asking me,
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:50.500]  I wanted to begin at this stage being one of the veterans of the Black Panther Party.
[02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:55.500]  The party was founded in October 1966 in Oakland, California.
[02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:58.500]  I joined the party in 1967 the following year.
[02:27:58.500 --> 02:28:00.500]  But however, I want people to remember this.
[02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:06.500]  By the end of the 1980s, in fact, even before, frankly,
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:14.500]  the Black Panther Party for self-defense had been absolutely physically decimated.
[02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:18.500]  Murders by and from the federal government.
[02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:21.500]  I'm also talking about setups.
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:23.500]  I'm talking about discreditation.
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:28.500]  I'm talking about every vile, vicious, despicable tactic.
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:29.500]  Infiltration?
[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:30.500]  Infiltrations.
[02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:32.500]  And people died.
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:33.500]  Many, many people died.
[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:35.500]  Families were destroyed.
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:37.500]  This is what we need to understand.
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:40.500]  I don't care what our color is, black, white, brown, red, yellow.
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.500]  We better all understand that we are in this struggle together.
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:47.500]  And if we are to survive, we'd better do it collectively,
[02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:49.500]  and we'd better do it together,
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:52.500]  and we'd better stop being played off once against the other.
[02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:55.500]  We don't have to agree 100% with everything.
[02:28:55.500 --> 02:28:58.500]  No, but if anybody has their rights taken, we all have our rights taken.
[02:28:58.500 --> 02:28:59.500]  That is correct.
[02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:00.500]  That is absolutely correct.
[02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:01.500]  Hang together, hang separate.
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:02.500]  That's right.
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:05.500]  And what we're going to do is we are going to be together
[02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:07.500]  because we are going to win this thing.
[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:11.500]  As we said back in the day in the party, all power to the people.
[02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:14.500]  And we meant that not only figuratively, but quite literally.
[02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:16.500]  All power to the people.
[02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:19.500]  Yeah, how can you have so-called liberals today who used to say,
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:21.500]  and I think wrongly, you know, kill the pigs,
[02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:24.500]  because we need to wake the police up as well.
[02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:27.500]  Now they're, no, give the cops all the guns
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:28.500]  and we can't have them.
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:31.500]  I mean, how did the, we're going to come back with Larry Pinckney.
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:33.500]  You can tell he's an amazing speaker in mind.
[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:36.500]  We're going to be breaking it all down straight ahead,
[02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:37.500]  in, through, and beyond.
[02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:39.500]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:42.500]  Great job to the crew, all our affiliates and sponsors,
[02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:48.500]  and you, the listeners, will be back straight ahead, infowars.com.
[02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:50.500]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:52.500]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:56.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:56.500 --> 02:30:00.500]  For nearly 20 years, Alex has been the voice of warning
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:03.500]  on threatening issues that the big media won't dare talk about,
[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:05.500]  threats that trample the American dream.
[02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:07.500]  You know what we all face,
[02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:10.500]  a crashing economy that's forcing millions out of work
[02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:11.500]  and from their homes.
[02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:14.500]  Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:18.500]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.
[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:21.500]  The food you can trust in facing any of these threats
[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:23.500]  comes from e-foods directly.

[02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:07.500]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs

[02:31:30.500 --> 02:31:33.500]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:36.500]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel
[02:31:36.500 --> 02:31:39.500]  using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[02:31:39.500 --> 02:31:42.500]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:44.500]  while delivering the silver moisture

[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:27.500]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m.
[02:33:27.500 --> 02:33:28.500]  Central Standard Time.
[02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:29.500]  We are here.
[02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:31.500]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:33.500]  Larry Pinckney, been in the Black Panther Party
[02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:35.500]  since right after it was set up,
[02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:37.500]  helped found chapters in different parts of the country,
[02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:41.500]  was their spokesman, and was targeted,
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:43.500]  put in jail politically, even came out in Congress.
[02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:47.500]  If my memory serves correctly that he was set up politically.
[02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:51.500]  So an on-record former political prisoner here with us
[02:33:51.500 --> 02:33:53.500]  and when he was getting to, if he just joined us,
[02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:55.500]  is that they always sell the idea of
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:57.500]  let's just take one group's rights.
[02:33:57.500 --> 02:34:00.500]  And so they say, hey, let's take the Muslims' rights.
[02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:02.500]  And then now you hear it's for libertarians, conservatives,
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:04.500]  anti-war people, Tea Party,
[02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:07.500]  people that promote the Constitution.
[02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:09.500]  But notice the media only went with,
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:11.500]  oh, they went after conservatives and Tea Party.
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:14.500]  Now it turns out it was anybody promoting the Constitution.
[02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:17.500]  Oh, it was anti-war groups, not fake liberal fascists,
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:19.500]  but any real liberals.
[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:20.500]  Folks, the terms mean nothing.
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:26.500]  If you want justice, then you want basic checks and balances.
[02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:28.500]  And if you don't know history, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:30.500]  for new listeners, we are becoming a tyranny.
[02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:32.500]  Now, Larry Pinckney, I don't want to rant here
[02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:33.500]  because I can talk as well,
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:35.500]  but I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:36.500]  You were saying a lot during the break,
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:38.500]  you know, the good report to people that
[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:39.500]  you talk to people waking up everywhere,
[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:42.500]  but finishing up the point on the Second Amendment,
[02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:45.500]  on hanging together or hang separate, Larry Pinckney.
[02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:48.500]  You know, the fact is, is that if we do not know our history,
[02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:50.500]  Howard Zinn says this very well.
[02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:52.500]  He says, if you do not know your history,
[02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:55.500]  it's as if you were born yesterday.
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:57.500]  And if you were born yesterday,
[02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:01.500]  anyone can tell you anything who's in a position of authority
[02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:03.500]  and you have no way of checking up on it.
[02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:07.500]  My purpose as a veteran of the party,
[02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:11.500]  as an activist continuing today in the year 2013,
[02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:14.500]  my purpose is to do everything that I can
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:18.500]  to wake people up, to get them to understand, all of us,
[02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:21.500]  that the power must rest with us collectively.
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.500]  Every day, black, white, brown, red and yellow people,
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:24.500]  every day people.
[02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:27.500]  I was just saying to you during our break, Alex,
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:29.500]  and I'd like to say this on the air,
[02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:35.500]  that Infowars has done and is doing an incredible job.
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:37.500]  I have received, and I say an incredible job,
[02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:40.500]  I'm talking about in terms of waking people up,
[02:35:40.500 --> 02:35:43.500]  making, getting people to think, critically think,
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:45.500]  just think for God's sakes.
[02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:47.500]  Use your common sense, critically think.
[02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:49.500]  And Infowars, it's about that.
[02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:51.500]  It's doing that.
[02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:55.500]  People, including myself, are deeply, deeply appreciative.
[02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:56.500]  Oh, no.
[02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:57.500]  We're all in this together.
[02:35:57.500 --> 02:35:58.500]  I mean, I have no future, my children don't.
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:01.500]  If you don't have a future, if your family doesn't have a future,
[02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:03.500]  I mean, it's really such a simple equation.
[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:06.500]  We interviewed Professor Grip a few weeks ago out in L.A.,
[02:36:06.500 --> 02:36:08.500]  a video interview that's free online for everybody,
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:10.500]  and he just said, look, it's the same thing.
[02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:11.500]  If I'm not free, you're not free.
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:13.500]  I mean, it's such a simple equation,
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:15.500]  and you see the divide and conquer,
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:17.500]  and then you have to engage it sometimes in,
[02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:19.500]  hey, you've been divided and conquered,
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:21.500]  but it's still a group coming down on you
[02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:22.500]  because they've been programmed
[02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:24.500]  that that's how you get things done,
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:26.500]  and people think they're getting a power out of a group.
[02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:28.500]  How about a group that's into freedom,
[02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:31.500]  Bill of Rights, Constitution, due process,
[02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:34.500]  and the right of the people to be armed?
[02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:35.500]  I mean, that is a fundamental right,
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:37.500]  and the right of free speech.
[02:36:37.500 --> 02:36:38.500]  You know, as Bush leaves office,
[02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:39.500]  the whole agenda just continues.
[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:44.500]  What do you make of Obama and his foreign policy
[02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:47.500]  of putting al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:49.500]  against countries that were actually stabilizing forces
[02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:50.500]  in that region?
[02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:54.500]  Well, the whole point of drone man Barack Obama,
[02:36:54.500 --> 02:36:58.500]  let's call him what he really is, drone man Barack Obama,
[02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:01.500]  the whole point of Obama's policies
[02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:05.500]  really is to destabilize, destabilize
[02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:09.500]  government's countries.
[02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:10.500]  Now, why?
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:13.500]  Because if they can destabilize it,
[02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:16.500]  if Obama and his minions, drone man, can do this,
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:20.500]  then they have the pretext for going into those countries,
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:23.500]  and by the way, there are plenty of Americans,
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:27.500]  everyday Americans, who die as a result of this,
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.500]  whether they're in the U.S. military
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:31.500]  or whether they're just tourists
[02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:33.500]  trying to see another country,
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:37.500]  trying to acclimatize themselves to another culture.
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:41.500]  This, and I'm trying to be very calm about this.
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:42.500]  Can you imagine being in Pakistan
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:44.500]  where every day a plane flies over
[02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:47.500]  and just blows up whoever they want illegally?
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:49.500]  Exactly, exactly, and the fact is
[02:37:49.500 --> 02:37:52.500]  is that it's being done in our name, our name,
[02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:55.500]  and I call the left out about this, the so-called left,
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:58.500]  the so-called liberals, the so-called progressives.
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:37:59.500]  Where are you?
[02:37:59.500 --> 02:38:01.500]  What are you doing now?
[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:05.500]  When G.W. Bush was doing this, you were out in the streets.
[02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:07.500]  Where are you now, okay?
[02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:10.500]  Barack Obama, drone man, has taken this,
[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:13.500]  he has extended the policies of Bush
[02:38:13.500 --> 02:38:15.500]  and exacerbated them.
[02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:18.500]  Let's stop being hypocrites, let's be real,
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:21.500]  let's come together collectively as a people.
[02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:25.500]  That's how I, that is my take on it.
[02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:27.500]  Well, I've talked to so many national security people
[02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:29.500]  who are even establishment, and they're like,
[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:32.500]  look, these big corporations just want new wars
[02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:34.500]  to sell more bombs and to get resources
[02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:37.500]  for other corporations, and we don't even get the booty.
[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:40.500]  And I wouldn't be for it if we were getting the booty.
[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:42.500]  But we're, so many guys go,
[02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:44.500]  we need to go into Iraq to get the oil.
[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:45.500]  Oil prices went up.
[02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:48.500]  The truth is they went in because Saddam was over-pumping
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:50.500]  to pay off his debts, driving down the price.
[02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:53.500]  We went to Iraq to jack the price up.
[02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:56.500]  Right, right, it's always the opposite.
[02:38:56.500 --> 02:38:58.500]  I was just saying on a program last week,
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:02.500]  the host asked me, well, what do you think about the,
[02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:05.500]  how do you deal with the corporate stream media news?
[02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:06.500]  I said, this is how I deal with
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:07.500]  the corporate stream media news.
[02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:09.500]  I look at it, I reverse it,
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:11.500]  and then I move forward to find the truth.
[02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:12.500]  I decipher it.
[02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:15.500]  It's like if someone is speaking Russian or French
[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:17.500]  or German or Swahili or whatever,
[02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:19.500]  you have to decipher the language first.
[02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:21.500]  And this is how we have to handle this.
[02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:24.500]  I call it corporate stream vomit, let's be honest,
[02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:26.500]  because that's what it is.
[02:39:26.500 --> 02:39:29.500]  It's meant to control everyday people.
[02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:31.500]  And look at the messages, how they're anti-family,
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:34.500]  anti-male, anti-woman, anti-child.
[02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:36.500]  I mean, this is a group of crooks.
[02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:40.500]  Yes, and they are well-trained and well-funded crooks.
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:42.500]  They are criminals.
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:44.500]  It makes the mafia look like child's play.
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:46.500]  It really, really does.
[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:48.500]  Because they've all competed with each other in evil
[02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:51.500]  to develop the ultimate synthesis of scum.
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:53.500]  And it's a narrative.
[02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:55.500]  Alex, my brother, it's a narrative.
[02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:59.500]  It's a narrative that this corporate stream media puts out.
[02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:02.500]  I call them the propaganda arm of the government,
[02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:04.500]  of the corporate-owned government.
[02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:07.500]  They are this so-called news media, in quotation marks,
[02:40:07.500 --> 02:40:09.500]  propaganda arm.
[02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:13.500]  Why Hermann GÃ¶ring of World War II fame
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:18.500]  would be absolutely ecstatic with joy
[02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:22.500]  to see how so many people in this country,
[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:24.500]  and throughout the world, but in this country,
[02:40:24.500 --> 02:40:27.500]  have been programmed and to accept that narrative,
[02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:30.500]  buy that narrative, forget their narrative.
[02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:32.500]  We must develop our own narrative.
[02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:34.500]  That's my next question, and we do that from history,
[02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:36.500]  common sense, research, not being lazy.
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:38.500]  Because even when you want to know the truth,
[02:40:38.500 --> 02:40:40.500]  it's hard to get at, much less just being lazy
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:42.500]  and just accepting whatever you're told,
[02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:44.500]  plus the world's so busy, I don't blame people.
[02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:47.500]  But it's at your peril that you ignore this info.
[02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:50.500]  The narrative seems to be collapsing more and more, though,
[02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:53.500]  for the establishment Democrats and establishment Republicans.
[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:55.500]  And A, do you agree with that?
[02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:58.500]  And B, how do you expect them to try to then
[02:40:58.500 --> 02:41:00.500]  clamp back down and get control of the narrative?
[02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:02.500]  Absolutely, I agree with that.
[02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:05.500]  These Democrats, Republicans, I call them Republicans,
[02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:09.500]  because they all feed from precisely the same trough, okay?
[02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:11.500]  But absolutely, I agree with that.
[02:41:11.500 --> 02:41:16.500]  Their narrative is being challenged and questioned
[02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:19.500]  and therefore is being broken down.
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:22.500]  But we've got a lot more work to do, a lot more work to do.
[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:26.500]  However, the monsters that we're dealing with,
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:28.500]  and yes, they are monsters.
[02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:31.500]  I understand that they're supposed to be human beings,
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:34.500]  but human beings can act in very monstrous ways,
[02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:36.500]  and that's what they do, deliberately.
[02:41:36.500 --> 02:41:41.500]  Anyway, the point is is that we can expect
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:44.500]  that the corporate media, the corporate government,
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:47.500]  Wall Street, the whole bunch of them, their gang,
[02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:49.500]  I like that term because that's exactly what they are,
[02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:52.500]  their gang, they're going to engage
[02:41:52.500 --> 02:41:54.500]  in all kinds of activities.
[02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:57.500]  They're going to have false flag events
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:41:59.500]  occurring constantly.
[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:00.500]  Why?
[02:42:00.500 --> 02:42:02.500]  Because that diverts people's attention,
[02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:05.500]  it keeps people in fear, it keeps people divided.
[02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:07.500]  Expect this, brothers and sisters, expect this.
[02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:10.500]  I had Bloomberg, two reporters, call me yesterday
[02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:12.500]  doing a big investigative report and they kept going,
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:14.500]  why do you think the government might be involved?
[02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:16.500]  And I said, well, they've been involved in hundreds of events
[02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:18.500]  and they didn't want to hear real events,
[02:42:18.500 --> 02:42:19.500]  they didn't want to see facts.
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:21.500]  I go, if somebody's done something over and over again
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:22.500]  and then it fits the same narrative
[02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:24.500]  and then they're covering stuff up
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:27.500]  and these guys were handled by the FBI and CIA,
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:28.500]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:30.500]  and then when the guy's in the hospital,
[02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:31.500]  they say that they've now admitted to it
[02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:33.500]  and now there's a letter found in the boat.
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:37.500]  And they kept saying, well, we're going to say you said this
[02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:39.500]  and they would say something I didn't say
[02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:40.500]  and they'd go, is that fair?
[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:41.500]  Is that fair for an hour?
[02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:43.500]  And I said, man, I can't do this anymore with you.
[02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:45.500]  I said, this is what I said.
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:47.500]  And they'd go, but is it fair to say this
[02:42:47.500 --> 02:42:48.500]  and they'd say back this other thing.
[02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:49.500]  Is it fair?
[02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:52.500]  And it was just that they were there to get a fake statement
[02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:54.500]  and they're listening right now
[02:42:54.500 --> 02:42:56.500]  to put it out there to make us look stupid.
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:58.500]  And look, man, I don't have all the answers.
[02:42:58.500 --> 02:43:01.500]  I just know this government's run by a bunch of crooks
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:04.500]  and it's getting worse and I kept telling reporters,
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:05.500]  I go, do you really think you're safe
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:08.500]  living in a country run by a bunch of ruthless crooks?
[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:10.500]  Do you really want to play games right now?
[02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:12.500]  And the fact is, as you were talking,
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:13.500]  as you were talking just now, Alex,
[02:43:13.500 --> 02:43:15.500]  I thought about the USS Liberty.
[02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:18.500]  How many people, how many people in this country
[02:43:18.500 --> 02:43:21.500]  are aware of the USS Liberty, okay?
[02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:22.500]  Tell them about it.
[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:25.500]  The ship that was attacked really as a result
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:30.500]  of US guidance by the Israelis who were acting as proxies.
[02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:34.500]  This was a ship that had all Americans on it.
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:38.500]  When I say all Americans, it was a US Navy ship, okay?
[02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:40.500]  It was attacked, it was in international waters.
[02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:43.500]  It was attacked for over two hours.
[02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:46.500]  Many people on that vessel were killed, okay?
[02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:49.500]  This was at the bidding of whom?
[02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:50.500]  Of our own government.
[02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:53.500]  And I use the word own in heavy quotation marks.
[02:43:53.500 --> 02:43:55.500]  Now, if they'll do that,
[02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:56.500]  and they've done so many other things
[02:43:56.500 --> 02:44:00.500]  from the Pueblo incident in the late 1960s
[02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:04.500]  to what occurred just a few years later with USS Liberty
[02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:07.500]  to what the Central Intelligence Agency
[02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:09.500]  and other agencies have done in New York,
[02:44:09.500 --> 02:44:12.500]  in Minneapolis, in Los Angeles.
[02:44:12.500 --> 02:44:13.500]  When I say what they have done,
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:16.500]  I'm talking about the tactics that they use
[02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:18.500]  to control and manipulate.
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:19.500]  Well, they go out and find mentally ill
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:22.500]  or low IQ people, give them money for years,
[02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:23.500]  then give them real bombs,
[02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:27.500]  tell them they coordinate, they lead, they hatch the plans.
[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:30.500]  And I was quoting the New York Times to Bloomberg going,
[02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:32.500]  hey, here's the New York Times admitting
[02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:34.500]  all the major terror plots were hatched by the FBI.
[02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:35.500]  Here's the headline.
[02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:36.500]  They go, we're not gonna discuss that.
[02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:37.500]  Why?
[02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:38.500]  Why?
[02:44:38.500 --> 02:44:39.500]  And I was like, well, then how am I supposed to?
[02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:41.500]  I'm the conspiracy theorist.
[02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:43.500]  You've got groups that have done this over and over again.
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:44.500]  They're dangerous.
[02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:46.500]  I don't like messing with them, but it's gotta be done.
[02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:47.500]  Justice demands it,
[02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:50.500]  and you've got these giggling reporters on the other end.
[02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:52.500]  And I'm like, hey, this isn't funny.
[02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:55.500]  Right, it's very dangerous, and it's very,
[02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:59.500]  it's absolutely necessary that we the people understand
[02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:01.500]  that it's affecting our very lives
[02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:03.500]  and livelihood for that matter.
[02:45:03.500 --> 02:45:06.500]  The fact is is that if we don't pay attention to it,
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:08.500]  I know I've heard the thing before, Alex,
[02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:09.500]  I'm sure you have.
[02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:13.500]  Oh, Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:15.500]  Okay, you know what my answer is to that?
[02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:20.500]  You, sir, madam, are a denial theorist.
[02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:24.500]  Okay, we've got, and that's part of that corporate narrative.
[02:45:24.500 --> 02:45:27.500]  Just keep people denying, just keep them running around
[02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:31.500]  like rats in a cage, like hamsters running across that wheel,
[02:45:31.500 --> 02:45:32.500]  and we can control them.
[02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:35.500]  It's time for us to stop being denial theorists.
[02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:38.500]  It's time for us to be critical thinkers.
[02:45:38.500 --> 02:45:40.500]  And most of the time, it's their narrative
[02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:43.500]  that they're trying to put in your mouth or my mouth.
[02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:44.500]  That's what they're trying-
[02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:45.500]  Which is constantly changing.
[02:45:45.500 --> 02:45:49.500]  Why do you think all this stuff is coming out
[02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:50.500]  on Obama right now?
[02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:52.500]  I mean, I think it's because they've intimidated the press.
[02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:54.500]  Obviously, Obama's just kind of their puppet
[02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:56.500]  to be able to get their agenda through,
[02:45:56.500 --> 02:45:58.500]  and people think it's trendy and go back to sleep.
[02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:00.500]  It's the globalist agenda like Bush, Obama.
[02:46:00.500 --> 02:46:02.500]  They're all just puppets of this, clearly.
[02:46:02.500 --> 02:46:05.500]  But a lot of times, they bring out scandals on the second term
[02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:07.500]  because the power structure doesn't want one group
[02:46:07.500 --> 02:46:08.500]  getting too powerful.
[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:10.500]  But this, I think, I watched those hearings
[02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:12.500]  where those whistleblowers went public.
[02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:13.500]  They were scared.
[02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:14.500]  They were told to stand down.
[02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:16.500]  For some reason, they wanted that ambassador dead.
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:18.500]  We now know it was to get missiles to al-Qaeda.
[02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:19.500]  And they think we're so dumb,
[02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:21.500]  they're going to have al-Qaeda blow stuff up
[02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:23.500]  and then, I guess, take our liberties
[02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:25.500]  because they're al-Qaeda blow stuff up.
[02:46:25.500 --> 02:46:27.500]  Do you think that's accurate,
[02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:28.500]  or what do you think is going on?
[02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:30.500]  Well, the bitter irony when we speak of al-Qaeda
[02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:32.500]  is al-Qaeda is, in fact, what?
[02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:36.500]  It came into being as a result of the United States CIA.
[02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:37.500]  On record.
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:38.500]  It's right on record.
[02:46:38.500 --> 02:46:40.500]  This is on congressional record.
[02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:42.500]  It is all over the place.
[02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:45.500]  But how many people are cognizant of that?
[02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:50.500]  How many people know that the, quote, unquote, terrorists
[02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:55.500]  were groomed by none other than our so-called government?
[02:46:55.500 --> 02:46:56.500]  Okay?
[02:46:56.500 --> 02:46:59.500]  And we are the victims, as well as people all over the world.
[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:01.500]  And that's not even our theory.
[02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:04.500]  We know they were and protected,
[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:06.500]  and so why do I get my rights taken?
[02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:07.500]  Right.
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:08.500]  I mean, this is the oldest trick in the book.
[02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:09.500]  Right, right.
[02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:12.500]  And as I said, Hermann Goring and others in the Third Reich,
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:13.500]  and people go,
[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:15.500]  hey, don't bring up the Nazis, don't bring up the Nazis.
[02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:18.500]  Okay, let's bring up Benito Mussolini.
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:19.500]  He did the same thing.
[02:47:19.500 --> 02:47:20.500]  It's obvious.
[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:21.500]  Yes, and for that matter,
[02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:26.500]  let's bring up the US black dictator Francisco Franco.
[02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:27.500]  He did the same thing in Spain.
[02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:28.500]  He did false flags.
[02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:29.500]  Yes, all the time.
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:30.500]  All the time.
[02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:32.500]  So this is not an ideological thing.
[02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:34.500]  This is a people's real thing.
[02:47:34.500 --> 02:47:36.500]  And we better pay attention.
[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:38.500]  Well, yeah, because even if real terrorists attack us,
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:40.500]  we gut up, we deal with it.
[02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:41.500]  We don't give our rights up because of it.
[02:47:41.500 --> 02:47:43.500]  But when they blow something up and go day one,
[02:47:43.500 --> 02:47:45.500]  give your rights up, 9-11.
[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:46.500]  You'll never have rights again.
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:47.500]  It's the end of freedom in America.
[02:47:47.500 --> 02:47:49.500]  Well, even if they didn't do it,
[02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:50.500]  which it shows they did,
[02:47:50.500 --> 02:47:52.500]  you're trying to take my rights using a tragedy.
[02:47:52.500 --> 02:47:53.500]  Right.
[02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:54.500]  You don't negotiate with terrorists.
[02:47:54.500 --> 02:47:56.500]  You don't give up your rights because of it.
[02:47:56.500 --> 02:47:57.500]  I mean, right there,
[02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:59.500]  there's no doubt that's what's going on.
[02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:00.500]  Absolutely.
[02:48:00.500 --> 02:48:01.500]  There is no doubt.
[02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:04.500]  I mean, if we give up our rights,
[02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:08.500]  then we have no right to freedom, to justice,
[02:48:08.500 --> 02:48:10.500]  to liberty, to any of those things.
[02:48:10.500 --> 02:48:12.500]  Why do you think these scandals are coming out now then?
[02:48:12.500 --> 02:48:15.500]  I think that thanks to what you are doing
[02:48:15.500 --> 02:48:17.500]  and others like yourself,
[02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:22.500]  I think that more and more the corporate stream media
[02:48:22.500 --> 02:48:24.500]  and the corporate controlled government
[02:48:24.500 --> 02:48:26.500]  are finding themselves in a situation
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:28.500]  where they're being questioned and challenged.
[02:48:28.500 --> 02:48:30.500]  And I think we need to intensify
[02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:32.500]  that questioning and challenging.
[02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:33.500]  In fact, that's what they've been bemoaning.
[02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:34.500]  I think you're right.
[02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:36.500]  They've been saying there's all this new media
[02:48:36.500 --> 02:48:37.500]  and groups that we don't control
[02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:40.500]  and people are pointing out
[02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:41.500]  that we said something different a week ago
[02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:42.500]  than we're saying now.
[02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:43.500]  Right, right, absolutely.
[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:45.500]  And I smile not because it's funny,
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:47.500]  but it's so ludicrous.
[02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:48.500]  It's pathetic.
[02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:53.500]  And I always say to sisters and brothers,
[02:48:53.500 --> 02:48:54.500]  brothers and sisters,
[02:48:54.500 --> 02:48:56.500]  let's keep some levity in this
[02:48:56.500 --> 02:48:58.500]  because if we don't have some levity,
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:48:59.500]  we'll go insane.
[02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:00.500]  I agree.
[02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:01.500]  And we're not going to go insane.
[02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:02.500]  We're going to keep some levity in this.
[02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:03.500]  And so I smile.
[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:08.500]  And the more we look at what the tactics are
[02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:09.500]  of these people,
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:10.500]  they really haven't changed.
[02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:11.500]  They really haven't changed
[02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:13.500]  from the 60s to the 70s, the 80s.
[02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:14.500]  No, they don't change.
[02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:15.500]  It's funny.
[02:49:15.500 --> 02:49:18.500]  They are obsessive compulsive.
[02:49:18.500 --> 02:49:19.500]  They do the same thing the exact same way.
[02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:20.500]  Right, right.
[02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:21.500]  Here's an example.
[02:49:21.500 --> 02:49:22.500]  A lot of cops are actually waking up
[02:49:22.500 --> 02:49:23.500]  and I don't want to play part
[02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:24.500]  of that balkanization demonizing them
[02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:25.500]  because that's what they want us
[02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:26.500]  to be, us against them.
[02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:28.500]  But they're trying to make police
[02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:29.500]  more and more corrupt,
[02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:30.500]  more and more authoritarian.
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:33.500]  And when a cop's all over the country,
[02:49:33.500 --> 02:49:34.500]  I'll walk up and say,
[02:49:34.500 --> 02:49:35.500]  why are you videotaping?
[02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:36.500]  And I'll be on the street corner.
[02:49:36.500 --> 02:49:37.500]  I go, well, you're 100 yards away.
[02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:38.500]  Am I interfering with you?
[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:39.500]  Well, no, but I want your name and stuff.
[02:49:39.500 --> 02:49:41.500]  And I go, well, I want your name and stuff.
[02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:42.500]  And then I'll just laugh.
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:43.500]  And I'll go, come on, man,
[02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:44.500]  this isn't North Korea.
[02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:46.500]  And I've noticed then they'll start laughing too,
[02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:48.500]  realizing they've been told to do this,
[02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:49.500]  but it's so stupid.
[02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:50.500]  If you act afraid,
[02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:52.500]  then they like alert and take you to jail.
[02:49:52.500 --> 02:49:54.500]  But if you laugh and go, man, knock it off.
[02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:55.500]  Yeah.
[02:49:55.500 --> 02:49:56.500]  Stop.
[02:49:56.500 --> 02:49:57.500]  You know, this is ridiculous.
[02:49:57.500 --> 02:49:58.500]  Then they kind of click and go,
[02:49:58.500 --> 02:49:59.500]  yeah, this is ridiculous.
[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:00.500]  You know, like cops were saying
[02:50:00.500 --> 02:50:01.500]  we couldn't hand out our magazines
[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:02.500]  in downtown Austin.
[02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:03.500]  And I called them up,
[02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:04.500]  got the cops on the phone.
[02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:05.500]  My guys were down there.
[02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:08.500]  And I go, why are you doing this to America?
[02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:09.500]  Why are you doing this to your family?
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:10.500]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:11.500]  Like, yeah, I know.
[02:50:11.500 --> 02:50:12.500]  I listen to your show.
[02:50:12.500 --> 02:50:13.500]  I've been told to do this.
[02:50:13.500 --> 02:50:14.500]  And we go out and give that ticket
[02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:15.500]  and I'm going to sue you.
[02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:16.500]  And so then they back off,
[02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:18.500]  but they're already given some tickets.
[02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:19.500]  And then I go down there
[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:20.500]  and the cops are all,
[02:50:20.500 --> 02:50:21.500]  hey, let's pose a little photo.
[02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:22.500]  You're right.
[02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:23.500]  We don't like it.
[02:50:23.500 --> 02:50:24.500]  We're glad you stood up to us.
[02:50:24.500 --> 02:50:25.500]  We don't like to follow these orders.
[02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:29.500]  Well, you should say no up front.
[02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:30.500]  You should say no like I did
[02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:31.500]  instead of just,
[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:32.500]  I mean, in America,
[02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:33.500]  we can't hand out magazines
[02:50:33.500 --> 02:50:34.500]  during South by Southwest
[02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:35.500]  anywhere downtown.
[02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:37.500]  I mean, what's wrong with you?
[02:50:37.500 --> 02:50:38.500]  Right.
[02:50:38.500 --> 02:50:39.500]  Right.
[02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:40.500]  And the fact is,
[02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:41.500]  is that, you know,
[02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:42.500]  all people,
[02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:43.500]  whether they call themselves
[02:50:43.500 --> 02:50:44.500]  police officers,
[02:50:44.500 --> 02:50:45.500]  whether they call themselves military,
[02:50:45.500 --> 02:50:46.500]  I'm going to give a zip
[02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:47.500]  what they call themselves.
[02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:48.500]  The fact of the matter is,
[02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:49.500]  is that we better begin
[02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:50.500]  from the standpoint of our humanity
[02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:51.500]  and our freedom.
[02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:52.500]  We better begin there
[02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:53.500]  and end there
[02:50:53.500 --> 02:50:54.500]  and keep it there.
[02:50:54.500 --> 02:50:55.500]  I agree with you.
[02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:56.500]  We got to go to break.
[02:50:56.500 --> 02:50:57.500]  Larry Pinckney's our guest.
[02:50:57.500 --> 02:50:58.500]  We'll give you his website
[02:50:58.500 --> 02:50:59.500]  on the other side as well.
[02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:00.500]  Stay with us.
[02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:01.500]  We all know that
[02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:03.500]  Berkey water purification systems
[02:51:03.500 --> 02:51:04.500]  are the most trusted name

[02:52:59.500 --> 02:53:01.500]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger,
[02:53:01.500 --> 02:53:02.500]  author of the bestselling book
[02:53:02.500 --> 02:53:04.500]  Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:05.500]  I want you to know
[02:53:05.500 --> 02:53:07.500]  some very important information.
[02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:10.500]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[02:53:10.500 --> 02:53:11.500]  requested that Carnivora
[02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:13.500]  be sent directly to the White House
[02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:14.500]  at a time when only the President
[02:53:14.500 --> 02:53:16.500]  could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:16.500 --> 02:53:18.500]  Now, 27 years later,
[02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:19.500]  Carnivora capsules
[02:53:19.500 --> 02:53:20.500]  are used around the world
[02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:22.500]  to keep people healthy.
[02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:23.500]  Now you can protect yourself
[02:53:23.500 --> 02:53:24.500]  and your loved ones
[02:53:24.500 --> 02:53:25.500]  in this age of superbugs
[02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:28.500]  with 17 naturally occurring compounds
[02:53:28.500 --> 02:53:29.500]  that instinctively respond
[02:53:29.500 --> 02:53:31.500]  to abnormal cells only
[02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:33.500]  without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:34.500]  If you want to stay healthy,
[02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:35.500]  now is your chance
[02:53:35.500 --> 02:53:36.500]  to literally wake up
[02:53:36.500 --> 02:53:37.500]  your critical immune cells
[02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:39.500]  to attack harmful invaders
[02:53:39.500 --> 02:53:41.500]  that don't belong in your body.

[02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:36.500]  We're going to do overdrive.
[02:54:36.500 --> 02:54:37.500]  Some stations carry it,
[02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:38.500]  but if you don't,
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:39.500]  it'll be on the podcast

[02:54:51.500 --> 02:54:53.500]  I have done two hours
[02:54:53.500 --> 02:54:55.500]  and 54 minutes so far,
[02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:56.500]  and I have not plugged
[02:54:56.500 --> 02:54:57.500]  any of the water filters we sell,
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:54:58.500]  which is a win win.
[02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:00.500]  Stop drinking all their poison,
[02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:01.500]  the cancer exploding,

[02:55:04.500 --> 02:55:05.500]  that funds us that we feel
[02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:06.500]  is incredibly moral
[02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:08.500]  at the lowest price out there.

[02:55:14.500 --> 02:55:16.500]  We have the non hybrid,
[02:55:16.500 --> 02:55:17.500]  non GMO heirloom,

[02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:21.500]  The lowest prices at Infowars
[02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:22.500]  store dot com.
[02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:23.500]  The books, the T-shirts,
[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:25.500]  the films, all of it.

[02:55:27.500 --> 02:55:28.500]  And we went out
[02:55:28.500 --> 02:55:29.500]  on the streets of Austin
[02:55:29.500 --> 02:55:31.500]  because it was such a demand.
[02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:32.500]  We put 80,000 on the streets
[02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:33.500]  of Central Texas
[02:55:33.500 --> 02:55:34.500]  are actually more than that.
[02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:35.500]  We were able to pull
[02:55:35.500 --> 02:55:38.500]  another thousand or so
[02:55:38.500 --> 02:55:39.500]  that aren't damaged
[02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:40.500]  and they're basically gone
[02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:41.500]  everywhere else now.
[02:55:41.500 --> 02:55:42.500]  We went out and re pulled them
[02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:43.500]  off where we put them free
[02:55:43.500 --> 02:55:45.500]  for people in Central Texas.
[02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:46.500]  You can buy them right now
[02:55:46.500 --> 02:55:48.500]  at Infowars store dot com.
[02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:50.500]  Infowars store dot com.
[02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:51.500]  We held some back too
[02:55:51.500 --> 02:55:52.500]  for people to get
[02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:53.500]  a 12 month subscription.
[02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:54.500]  They also are a great gift
[02:55:54.500 --> 02:55:55.500]  to give.
[02:55:55.500 --> 02:55:56.500]  Big color, glossy,
[02:55:56.500 --> 02:55:58.500]  old fashioned size
[02:55:58.500 --> 02:55:59.500]  like the old Rolling Stone
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:01.500]  magazine.
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:03.500]  Great way to wake people up
[02:56:03.500 --> 02:56:04.500]  and this May issue
[02:56:04.500 --> 02:56:05.500]  that sold out so quick
[02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:06.500]  has three free bumper stickers
[02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:07.500]  on it.
[02:56:07.500 --> 02:56:08.500]  So we've gone and pulled
[02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:09.500]  another thousand
[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:10.500]  because the last thousand
[02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:11.500]  we got off the streets
[02:56:11.500 --> 02:56:12.500]  sold out in like a day.
[02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:13.500]  When they're gone,
[02:56:13.500 --> 02:56:14.500]  they're gone.
[02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:16.500]  Infowars store dot com.
[02:56:16.500 --> 02:56:17.500]  Now Larry Pinckney,
[02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:18.500]  I've asked a bunch
[02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:19.500]  of questions here.
[02:56:19.500 --> 02:56:20.500]  We're gonna go into overdrive
[02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:21.500]  in the next hour.
[02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:22.500]  And I've thrown out
[02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:23.500]  some stuff here.
[02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:24.500]  But what do you want
[02:56:24.500 --> 02:56:25.500]  to get into?
[02:56:25.500 --> 02:56:26.500]  Because obviously we can
[02:56:26.500 --> 02:56:27.500]  talk about a lot of stuff
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:28.500]  but what do you want
[02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:29.500]  to get into?
[02:56:29.500 --> 02:56:30.500]  Well I want to get into,
[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:32.500]  I want to remind people,
[02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:34.500]  all of us,
[02:56:34.500 --> 02:56:35.500]  that we are the ones
[02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:38.500]  who ultimately have the power.
[02:56:38.500 --> 02:56:40.500]  We have to recognize this.
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:41.500]  It's one thing
[02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:43.500]  and it's extremely important
[02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:44.500]  to warn people.
[02:56:44.500 --> 02:56:45.500]  That's why the system
[02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:46.500]  tells us we don't have power
[02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:47.500]  and flies around in big jets
[02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:48.500]  and red carpets
[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:49.500]  and big giant buildings
[02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:50.500]  is to make us feel small.
[02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:51.500]  Right, right.
[02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:52.500]  And if we feel small,
[02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:55.500]  we feel powerless.
[02:56:55.500 --> 02:56:58.500]  We are not powerless, okay?
[02:56:58.500 --> 02:56:59.500]  I think that we need
[02:56:59.500 --> 02:57:01.500]  to understand and some
[02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:02.500]  of the things-
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:03.500]  That's the key.
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:04.500]  That's what scares them.
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:05.500]  Yes.
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:06.500]  So we're gonna get into
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:07.500]  that in detail?
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:08.500]  Yes.
[02:57:08.500 --> 02:57:09.500]  We're just telling people
[02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:10.500]  what's coming up.
[02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:11.500]  What else do you want
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:12.500]  to get into?
[02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:13.500]  Well, I'll follow your lead.
[02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:14.500]  No man, I want to see
[02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:15.500]  what you wild carded.
[02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:16.500]  What else do you
[02:57:16.500 --> 02:57:17.500]  want to get into?
[02:57:17.500 --> 02:57:18.500]  Okay, what I would like
[02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:19.500]  to get into is I would also
[02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:20.500]  like to talk a bit
[02:57:20.500 --> 02:57:21.500]  about some possibilities
[02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:23.500]  that we can be doing out there.
[02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:25.500]  I want to be very positive.
[02:57:25.500 --> 02:57:26.500]  Talk about solutions.
[02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:27.500]  Yes, solutions.
[02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:29.500]  Well, I think it begins with
[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:30.500]  the seed of the universe,
[02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:31.500]  like Gandhi said,
[02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:32.500]  is in all of us.
[02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:33.500]  And the Bible says we're made
[02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:34.500]  in the image of the creator.
[02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:36.500]  That's pretty heavy stuff.
[02:57:36.500 --> 02:57:38.500]  Humans, we create.
[02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:40.500]  And again, again,
[02:57:40.500 --> 02:57:41.500]  ladies and gentlemen,
[02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:42.500]  I mean, if you look
[02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:43.500]  in the eyes of a child,
[02:57:43.500 --> 02:57:44.500]  I don't care what color
[02:57:44.500 --> 02:57:45.500]  they are, you see the soul.
[02:57:45.500 --> 02:57:46.500]  It's the same thing,
[02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:47.500]  a beautiful soul.
[02:57:47.500 --> 02:57:49.500]  And it tears my guts out
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:50.500]  to see the persecution
[02:57:50.500 --> 02:57:51.500]  of the innocent
[02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:52.500]  and the persecution,
[02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:53.500]  the eugenics
[02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:54.500]  of the globalists.
[02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:55.500]  And I want the globalists
[02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:56.500]  to know, and I think
[02:57:56.500 --> 02:57:57.500]  they know this,
[02:57:57.500 --> 02:57:58.500]  you're never going to inherit
[02:57:58.500 --> 02:57:59.500]  all the great things
[02:57:59.500 --> 02:58:00.500]  that humanity's going to have
[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:01.500]  if you try to take it
[02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:02.500]  from other people.
[02:58:02.500 --> 02:58:03.500]  The only way you're going
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:04.500]  to get anything is to try
[02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:05.500]  to give it to everybody else.
[02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:06.500]  That doesn't mean buy
[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:07.500]  into the fake counterfeit
[02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:08.500]  of, well, they give everything
[02:58:08.500 --> 02:58:09.500]  you've got to the government
[02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:10.500]  to distribute it.
[02:58:10.500 --> 02:58:11.500]  That's the lie of control.
[02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:12.500]  I'm talking about if you don't
[02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:14.500]  want justice and goodwill.
[02:58:14.500 --> 02:58:15.500]  People ask,
[02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:16.500]  what do you stand for?
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:17.500]  Goodwill.
[02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:18.500]  I start with goodwill.
[02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:19.500]  Yeah, if I find out you're evil
[02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:20.500]  and you want to destroy me,
[02:58:20.500 --> 02:58:21.500]  make me your slave,
[02:58:21.500 --> 02:58:22.500]  I'm mean, man.
[02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:23.500]  I'm aggressive,
[02:58:23.500 --> 02:58:25.500]  but God gave me all of that.
[02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:26.500]  I can think more evil
[02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:27.500]  than the evil guys,
[02:58:27.500 --> 02:58:28.500]  but I'm not going to use
[02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:29.500]  the evil.
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:30.500]  I can get into your shoes,
[02:58:30.500 --> 02:58:31.500]  though, to know
[02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:32.500]  what your next move is.
[02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:33.500]  And that's what you've got
[02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:34.500]  to do is tune in
[02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:35.500]  to the discernment
[02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:36.500]  God's given us all,
[02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:37.500]  and we can save humanity
[02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:38.500]  and go to the stars.
[02:58:38.500 --> 02:58:39.500]  Stay with us.

[03:00:27.500 --> 03:00:28.500]  All right, folks,
[03:00:28.500 --> 03:00:29.500]  we're in overdrive
[03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:30.500]  with Larry Pinckney,
[03:00:30.500 --> 03:00:33.500]  black activist, WG.org.
[03:00:33.500 --> 03:00:34.500]  All right, you are getting
[03:00:34.500 --> 03:00:35.500]  into the power of humanity.
[03:00:35.500 --> 03:00:36.500]  Let's spend five minutes on that
[03:00:36.500 --> 03:00:37.500]  and then come back
[03:00:37.500 --> 03:00:38.500]  to the final segment
[03:00:38.500 --> 03:00:39.500]  with you live here
[03:00:39.500 --> 03:00:40.500]  getting into solutions.
[03:00:40.500 --> 03:00:41.500]  Larry Pinckney.
[03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:42.500]  I want to say
[03:00:42.500 --> 03:00:43.500]  that I think that all of us,
[03:00:43.500 --> 03:00:44.500]  all of us,
[03:00:44.500 --> 03:00:46.500]  men, women, children,
[03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:47.500]  black, white, brown,
[03:00:47.500 --> 03:00:48.500]  red, yellow,
[03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:50.500]  all of us need to understand
[03:00:50.500 --> 03:00:51.500]  that if we're going
[03:00:51.500 --> 03:00:52.500]  to bring about change,
[03:00:52.500 --> 03:00:53.500]  to change things
[03:00:53.500 --> 03:00:55.500]  for ourselves individually
[03:00:55.500 --> 03:00:57.500]  as well as everyone collectively,
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:00:59.500]  that means we have to understand
[03:00:59.500 --> 03:01:01.500]  that the power rests with us,
[03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:03.500]  not with the government,
[03:01:03.500 --> 03:01:04.500]  not with corporations,
[03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:05.500]  but with us.
[03:01:05.500 --> 03:01:06.500]  We have to begin
[03:01:06.500 --> 03:01:08.500]  to communicate with each other.
[03:01:08.500 --> 03:01:09.500]  Does that mean
[03:01:09.500 --> 03:01:10.500]  we're going to agree
[03:01:10.500 --> 03:01:11.500]  100% of the time?
[03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:12.500]  Absolutely not.
[03:01:12.500 --> 03:01:14.500]  We don't want robots.
[03:01:14.500 --> 03:01:15.500]  We want thinking,
[03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:17.500]  feeling human beings.
[03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:18.500]  And I think
[03:01:18.500 --> 03:01:19.500]  that's very important.
[03:01:19.500 --> 03:01:21.500]  Anybody who's in agreement
[03:01:21.500 --> 03:01:23.500]  with someone 100% of the time,
[03:01:23.500 --> 03:01:24.500]  somebody's lying.
[03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:25.500]  And we don't want liars.
[03:01:25.500 --> 03:01:26.500]  We want thinking,
[03:01:26.500 --> 03:01:27.500]  critically thinking,
[03:01:27.500 --> 03:01:29.500]  acting, doing people.
[03:01:29.500 --> 03:01:31.500]  So ultimately, Alex,
[03:01:31.500 --> 03:01:33.500]  I feel ultimately
[03:01:33.500 --> 03:01:35.500]  that I see good things
[03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:36.500]  in the future.
[03:01:36.500 --> 03:01:37.500]  I really do.
[03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:38.500]  I see good things happening.
[03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:39.500]  When I say good things,
[03:01:39.500 --> 03:01:41.500]  I mean people are waking up
[03:01:41.500 --> 03:01:42.500]  from being in a state
[03:01:42.500 --> 03:01:45.500]  of sheeple, if you will.
[03:01:45.500 --> 03:01:46.500]  They're waking up
[03:01:46.500 --> 03:01:47.500]  to understand
[03:01:47.500 --> 03:01:48.500]  that we're the ones
[03:01:48.500 --> 03:01:51.500]  who can change our lot, okay?
[03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:52.500]  And to me,
[03:01:52.500 --> 03:01:53.500]  that's extremely important
[03:01:53.500 --> 03:01:55.500]  because I've heard people say,
[03:01:55.500 --> 03:01:56.500]  well, you guys do.
[03:01:56.500 --> 03:01:57.500]  You just talk about
[03:01:57.500 --> 03:01:59.500]  all the bad things.
[03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:00.500]  Well, we don't just talk
[03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:01.500]  about the bad things.
[03:02:01.500 --> 03:02:02.500]  We identify those-
[03:02:02.500 --> 03:02:04.500]  Well, the world is so beautiful
[03:02:04.500 --> 03:02:06.500]  and good, it's because I love
[03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:07.500]  all the beauty
[03:02:07.500 --> 03:02:08.500]  and the good stuff
[03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:09.500]  that the evil that's growing
[03:02:09.500 --> 03:02:10.500]  makes me mad.
[03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:11.500]  It's like if you have
[03:02:11.500 --> 03:02:12.500]  a forest fire
[03:02:12.500 --> 03:02:13.500]  out back at your house,
[03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:14.500]  hey, don't talk about the fire.
[03:02:14.500 --> 03:02:15.500]  Come in and have a beer.
[03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:16.500]  What's going to burn
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:17.500]  our house down
[03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:18.500]  if we don't put the fire out?
[03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:19.500]  Exactly.
[03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:20.500]  Good point.
[03:02:20.500 --> 03:02:21.500]  I actually used
[03:02:21.500 --> 03:02:22.500]  that example myself
[03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:23.500]  when people criticized me
[03:02:23.500 --> 03:02:24.500]  for being on certain programs,
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:26.500]  including this one.
[03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:27.500]  And I asked them,
[03:02:27.500 --> 03:02:28.500]  well, what do you think
[03:02:28.500 --> 03:02:29.500]  about the substance
[03:02:29.500 --> 03:02:31.500]  of what the program was about?
[03:02:31.500 --> 03:02:32.500]  Oh, that was good.
[03:02:32.500 --> 03:02:33.500]  I said, well,
[03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:34.500]  something does not compute
[03:02:34.500 --> 03:02:35.500]  if that was good.
[03:02:35.500 --> 03:02:36.500]  The substance of what
[03:02:36.500 --> 03:02:37.500]  the program was about.
[03:02:37.500 --> 03:02:38.500]  What is your problem?
[03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:39.500]  They said, well,
[03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:41.500]  it's just that it's that program.
[03:02:41.500 --> 03:02:42.500]  Well, I think they don't want
[03:02:42.500 --> 03:02:45.500]  the criticism by trolls.
[03:02:45.500 --> 03:02:47.500]  They misjudge the trolls attacking
[03:02:47.500 --> 03:02:49.500]  means you're doing good work
[03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:50.500]  and there's nothing
[03:02:50.500 --> 03:02:51.500]  to be afraid of.
[03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:52.500]  Right.
[03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:53.500]  But if you're not being
[03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:54.500]  criticized, no one's
[03:02:54.500 --> 03:02:55.500]  looking at you.
[03:02:55.500 --> 03:02:56.500]  I mean, when you get
[03:02:56.500 --> 03:02:57.500]  the big groups of people
[03:02:57.500 --> 03:02:58.500]  looking at you,
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:02:59.500]  you're going to get attacked.
[03:02:59.500 --> 03:03:00.500]  Right, right.
[03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:01.500]  That just goes with it.
[03:03:01.500 --> 03:03:02.500]  And that's what
[03:03:02.500 --> 03:03:03.500]  we've got to look at it
[03:03:03.500 --> 03:03:05.500]  in almost exactly the same words.
[03:03:05.500 --> 03:03:07.500]  If you're not doing something
[03:03:07.500 --> 03:03:08.500]  for the people,
[03:03:08.500 --> 03:03:09.500]  you're not going
[03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:10.500]  to get attacked.
[03:03:10.500 --> 03:03:11.500]  But if you are,
[03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:12.500]  if you're serving the people,
[03:03:12.500 --> 03:03:13.500]  rest assured,
[03:03:13.500 --> 03:03:14.500]  you're going to be attacked.
[03:03:14.500 --> 03:03:16.500]  So we got to look at it
[03:03:16.500 --> 03:03:17.500]  from that positive.
[03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:18.500]  Well, sure,
[03:03:18.500 --> 03:03:19.500]  that's what I'm saying
[03:03:19.500 --> 03:03:21.500]  is that I don't have
[03:03:21.500 --> 03:03:22.500]  all the answers.
[03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:23.500]  I hear stuff I say
[03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:24.500]  six months later,
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:25.500]  don't totally agree with it
[03:03:25.500 --> 03:03:26.500]  because it's whatever
[03:03:26.500 --> 03:03:27.500]  mindset you're in
[03:03:27.500 --> 03:03:28.500]  or how you're saying it.
[03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:29.500]  You're like, oh,
[03:03:29.500 --> 03:03:30.500]  I wish I would have
[03:03:30.500 --> 03:03:31.500]  said it this way.
[03:03:31.500 --> 03:03:32.500]  I'm going to have to
[03:03:32.500 --> 03:03:33.500]  all over think it
[03:03:33.500 --> 03:03:34.500]  while they screw us
[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:35.500]  consciously.
[03:03:35.500 --> 03:03:36.500]  I'm just trying to get
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:37.500]  people out of their coma.
[03:03:37.500 --> 03:03:38.500]  Right.
[03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:39.500]  You don't have to agree
[03:03:39.500 --> 03:03:40.500]  with me.
[03:03:40.500 --> 03:03:41.500]  Wake up, man.
[03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:42.500]  Stuff isn't good.
[03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:43.500]  Right, right.
[03:03:43.500 --> 03:03:44.500]  That's what I'm.
[03:03:44.500 --> 03:03:45.500]  Get them out of that
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:46.500]  comatose state.
[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:47.500]  You know, again,
[03:03:47.500 --> 03:03:48.500]  I hearken back
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:49.500]  to Brother Malcolm.
[03:03:49.500 --> 03:03:50.500]  Malcolm talked about how
[03:03:50.500 --> 03:03:51.500]  that, you know,
[03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:52.500]  you go to the dentist office
[03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:53.500]  and the dentist
[03:03:53.500 --> 03:03:54.500]  shoots you up with novocaine.
[03:03:54.500 --> 03:03:55.500]  Meanwhile, you're bleeding
[03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:56.500]  all over the place,
[03:03:56.500 --> 03:03:57.500]  but you don't feel it.
[03:03:57.500 --> 03:03:58.500]  You don't see it
[03:03:58.500 --> 03:03:59.500]  because they've shot
[03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:00.500]  you up with novocaine.
[03:04:00.500 --> 03:04:01.500]  That was Malcolm.
[03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:02.500]  We're deadened.
[03:04:02.500 --> 03:04:03.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:04.500]  Exactly.
[03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:05.500]  And you know,
[03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:06.500]  and then I say,
[03:04:06.500 --> 03:04:07.500]  get rid of the deadening
[03:04:07.500 --> 03:04:08.500]  or you say it,
[03:04:08.500 --> 03:04:09.500]  you're causing pain.
[03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:10.500]  No, I'm getting
[03:04:10.500 --> 03:04:11.500]  the deadening away
[03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:12.500]  so you know what's
[03:04:12.500 --> 03:04:13.500]  going on.
[03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:14.500]  Exactly.
[03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:15.500]  And can therefore
[03:04:15.500 --> 03:04:16.500]  do something about it.
[03:04:16.500 --> 03:04:17.500]  You know,
[03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:18.500]  it's like the analogy
[03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:19.500]  you used about the house.
[03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:20.500]  If the house is on fire
[03:04:20.500 --> 03:04:21.500]  and the neighbor says,
[03:04:21.500 --> 03:04:22.500]  well, forget that.
[03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:23.500]  Come, let's have a beer.
[03:04:23.500 --> 03:04:24.500]  Well, I like beer,
[03:04:24.500 --> 03:04:25.500]  but come on.
[03:04:25.500 --> 03:04:26.500]  The house is on fire
[03:04:26.500 --> 03:04:27.500]  for crying out loud.
[03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:28.500]  That's a great analogy
[03:04:28.500 --> 03:04:29.500]  yourself.
[03:04:29.500 --> 03:04:30.500]  Exactly.
[03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:31.500]  And I'm like,
[03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:32.500]  I mean,
[03:04:32.500 --> 03:04:33.500]  it's like,
[03:04:33.500 --> 03:04:34.500]  that's very good.
[03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:35.500]  I'm sorry.
[03:04:35.500 --> 03:04:36.500]  That is,
[03:04:36.500 --> 03:04:37.500]  I mean,
[03:04:37.500 --> 03:04:38.500]  they started setting up
[03:04:38.500 --> 03:04:39.500]  police checkpoints
[03:04:39.500 --> 03:04:40.500]  on the highway,
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:41.500]  searching everybody
[03:04:41.500 --> 03:04:42.500]  like 15 years ago.
[03:04:42.500 --> 03:04:43.500]  People sued.
[03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:44.500]  They got upset.
[03:04:44.500 --> 03:04:45.500]  They ruled against it.
[03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:46.500]  They quit it.
[03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:47.500]  Now they're back.
[03:04:47.500 --> 03:04:48.500]  It's like,
[03:04:48.500 --> 03:04:49.500]  don't be anti-police.
[03:04:49.500 --> 03:04:50.500]  I'm not anti-police.
[03:04:50.500 --> 03:04:51.500]  Right, right, right.
[03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:52.500]  A country that has
[03:04:52.500 --> 03:04:53.500]  checkpoints is North
[03:04:53.500 --> 03:04:54.500]  Korea or Mexico.
[03:04:54.500 --> 03:04:55.500]  And I've been to Mexico
[03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:56.500]  when you're driving
[03:04:56.500 --> 03:04:57.500]  to go see the pyramids
[03:04:57.500 --> 03:04:58.500]  and the military
[03:04:58.500 --> 03:04:59.500]  and stuff like that.
[03:04:59.500 --> 03:05:00.500]  I don't know.
[03:05:00.500 --> 03:05:01.500]  I don't want to live
[03:05:01.500 --> 03:05:02.500]  like that.
[03:05:02.500 --> 03:05:03.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:03.500 --> 03:05:04.500]  Hello,
[03:05:04.500 --> 03:05:05.500]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:05.500 --> 03:05:06.500]  Myself,
[03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:07.500]  my family,
[03:05:07.500 --> 03:05:08.500]  the Infowars.com team
[03:05:08.500 --> 03:05:09.500]  want to relay to you
[03:05:09.500 --> 03:05:10.500]  and your families
[03:05:10.500 --> 03:05:11.500]  that we are intensifying
[03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:12.500]  our efforts against
[03:05:12.500 --> 03:05:13.500]  the globalist
[03:05:13.500 --> 03:05:14.500]  on every front.
[03:05:14.500 --> 03:05:15.500]  Infowars.com is leading
[03:05:15.500 --> 03:05:16.500]  the fight against
[03:05:16.500 --> 03:05:17.500]  the technocrats.
[03:05:17.500 --> 03:05:18.500]  But we can't do that
[03:05:18.500 --> 03:05:19.500]  without your help.
[03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:20.500]  By getting the films,
[03:05:20.500 --> 03:05:21.500]  bumper stickers,
[03:05:21.500 --> 03:05:22.500]  and t-shirts
[03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:23.500]  at Infowars.com,
[03:05:23.500 --> 03:05:24.500]  you will wake up
[03:05:24.500 --> 03:05:25.500]  people in your area
[03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:26.500]  and support
[03:05:26.500 --> 03:05:28.500]  our operation as we move
[03:05:28.500 --> 03:05:30.500]  to the next level.
[03:05:30.500 --> 03:05:31.500]  We need your help
[03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:32.500]  to spread the word
[03:05:32.500 --> 03:05:33.500]  like never before.
[03:05:33.500 --> 03:05:34.500]  They wish to hide
[03:05:34.500 --> 03:05:35.500]  themselves during
[03:05:35.500 --> 03:05:36.500]  this tectonic battle
[03:05:36.500 --> 03:05:37.500]  between the forces
[03:05:37.500 --> 03:05:39.500]  of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:39.500 --> 03:05:41.500]  You are the response
[03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:43.500]  to the globalist technocrats
[03:05:43.500 --> 03:05:44.500]  and their program
[03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:45.500]  of global eugenics
[03:05:45.500 --> 03:05:47.500]  dehumanization
[03:05:47.500 --> 03:05:49.500]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:50.500]  The war is here.
[03:05:50.500 --> 03:05:52.500]  It's an Infowar.
[03:05:52.500 --> 03:05:55.500]  The spirit of 1770
[03:05:55.500 --> 03:05:57.500]  of 1776 versus
[03:05:57.500 --> 03:06:00.500]  the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:00.500 --> 03:06:01.500]  What's safer and cheaper
[03:06:01.500 --> 03:06:03.500]  than prescription drugs?
[03:06:03.500 --> 03:06:04.500]  Glad you asked.
[03:06:04.500 --> 03:06:05.500]  The answer is
[03:06:05.500 --> 03:06:06.500]  renovation teas.
[03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:07.500]  Herbal remedies
[03:06:07.500 --> 03:06:08.500]  are much safer
[03:06:08.500 --> 03:06:09.500]  and much cheaper
[03:06:09.500 --> 03:06:10.500]  than prescription drugs.
[03:06:10.500 --> 03:06:11.500]  Tastes great,
[03:06:11.500 --> 03:06:12.500]  and most importantly,
[03:06:12.500 --> 03:06:14.500]  herbal teas are effective
[03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:15.500]  and non-addictive.

[03:06:17.500 --> 03:06:18.500]  and here's why.
[03:06:18.500 --> 03:06:19.500]  We spent years
[03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:20.500]  researching herbs
[03:06:20.500 --> 03:06:22.500]  and their beneficial properties.

[03:06:29.500 --> 03:06:30.500]  and health conditions,
[03:06:30.500 --> 03:06:31.500]  such as diabetes,
[03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:32.500]  blood pressure,
[03:06:32.500 --> 03:06:33.500]  anxiety,
[03:06:33.500 --> 03:06:34.500]  libido,
[03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:35.500]  detox,
[03:06:35.500 --> 03:06:36.500]  and much more.

[03:07:01.500 --> 03:07:02.500]  when your propane runs out
[03:07:02.500 --> 03:07:03.500]  and you don't have
[03:07:03.500 --> 03:07:04.500]  a large amount of wood

[03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:13.500]  like junk mail,
[03:07:13.500 --> 03:07:14.500]  small twigs, leaves,
[03:07:14.500 --> 03:07:16.500]  weeds, or dry sagebrush.
[03:07:16.500 --> 03:07:17.500]  Then just add a small amount
[03:07:17.500 --> 03:07:18.500]  of kindling wood
[03:07:18.500 --> 03:07:19.500]  and you'll be cooking
[03:07:19.500 --> 03:07:20.500]  entire meals in minutes.

[03:08:04.500 --> 03:08:06.500]  on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.500 --> 03:08:15.500]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:08:15.500 --> 03:08:17.500]  we are live.
[03:08:17.500 --> 03:08:18.500]  Thank you so much
[03:08:18.500 --> 03:08:19.500]  for joining us.
[03:08:19.500 --> 03:08:20.500]  Larry Pinckney,
[03:08:20.500 --> 03:08:22.500]  I guess the information minister
[03:08:22.500 --> 03:08:23.500]  at one point
[03:08:23.500 --> 03:08:24.500]  for the Black Panther Party,
[03:08:24.500 --> 03:08:26.500]  a minister of the interior,
[03:08:26.500 --> 03:08:27.500]  just a really interesting
[03:08:27.500 --> 03:08:28.500]  political mind.
[03:08:28.500 --> 03:08:29.500]  He was getting into
[03:08:29.500 --> 03:08:30.500]  the power of the people
[03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:31.500]  and that we have the power.
[03:08:31.500 --> 03:08:32.500]  We were talking about
[03:08:32.500 --> 03:08:33.500]  getting people out of their commas
[03:08:33.500 --> 03:08:34.500]  and other solutions.
[03:08:34.500 --> 03:08:35.500]  In this 12 minutes,
[03:08:35.500 --> 03:08:37.500]  you've got the floor, my friend.
[03:08:37.500 --> 03:08:39.500]  Break down solutions, ideas
[03:08:39.500 --> 03:08:41.500]  for people out there.
[03:08:41.500 --> 03:08:42.500]  Right, right.
[03:08:42.500 --> 03:08:43.500]  And let me just say that
[03:08:43.500 --> 03:08:44.500]  just historically
[03:08:44.500 --> 03:08:46.500]  I want to be very correct
[03:08:46.500 --> 03:08:47.500]  about this.
[03:08:47.500 --> 03:08:48.500]  I was minister of interior
[03:08:48.500 --> 03:08:50.500]  for the Republic of New Africa,
[03:08:50.500 --> 03:08:51.500]  RNA, as we called it.
[03:08:51.500 --> 03:08:52.500]  I can't keep track of it all.
[03:08:52.500 --> 03:08:54.500]  Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[03:08:54.500 --> 03:08:55.500]  I was in it
[03:08:55.500 --> 03:08:56.500]  and I still have a goal for me.
[03:08:56.500 --> 03:08:57.500]  All right, I was a section leader
[03:08:57.500 --> 03:08:59.500]  in the Black Panther Party.
[03:08:59.500 --> 03:09:00.500]  I'm a veteran of the party,
[03:09:00.500 --> 03:09:01.500]  et cetera, et cetera.
[03:09:01.500 --> 03:09:03.500]  Anyway, the point is this.
[03:09:03.500 --> 03:09:05.500]  The people in this country,
[03:09:05.500 --> 03:09:08.500]  the people in this country
[03:09:08.500 --> 03:09:10.500]  have to be creative.
[03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:11.500]  We have to come up
[03:09:11.500 --> 03:09:12.500]  with our solutions.
[03:09:12.500 --> 03:09:13.500]  You remember in the first segment
[03:09:13.500 --> 03:09:14.500]  we were talking about
[03:09:14.500 --> 03:09:16.500]  Malcolm's analogy
[03:09:16.500 --> 03:09:17.500]  about the Novocain being shot
[03:09:17.500 --> 03:09:19.500]  in people's gums,
[03:09:19.500 --> 03:09:20.500]  making us numb so we don't
[03:09:20.500 --> 03:09:23.500]  see or feel our pain.
[03:09:23.500 --> 03:09:24.500]  What we need to do
[03:09:24.500 --> 03:09:26.500]  after we get that Novocain out,
[03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:27.500]  what do I mean by that?
[03:09:27.500 --> 03:09:28.500]  I mean after we stop being
[03:09:28.500 --> 03:09:29.500]  couch potatoes,
[03:09:29.500 --> 03:09:32.500]  after we stop being disillusioned,
[03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:35.500]  after we stop being divided
[03:09:35.500 --> 03:09:36.500]  and begin to understand.
[03:09:36.500 --> 03:09:37.500]  Start taking it personal
[03:09:37.500 --> 03:09:38.500]  the globalists are screwing us
[03:09:38.500 --> 03:09:40.500]  instead of fighting with each other.
[03:09:40.500 --> 03:09:42.500]  That's right, that's point one.
[03:09:42.500 --> 03:09:43.500]  And you know what?
[03:09:43.500 --> 03:09:45.500]  We can do that in the heartbeat,
[03:09:45.500 --> 03:09:47.500]  individually and collectively.
[03:09:47.500 --> 03:09:48.500]  We can do that in the heartbeat.
[03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:49.500]  Is it easy?
[03:09:49.500 --> 03:09:51.500]  It's easier than you think.
[03:09:51.500 --> 03:09:52.500]  If somebody tries to push you
[03:09:52.500 --> 03:09:53.500]  around and rob your rights,
[03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:55.500]  you need to take it personal.
[03:09:55.500 --> 03:09:56.500]  They're trying to rob you
[03:09:56.500 --> 03:09:57.500]  of your most precious possession
[03:09:57.500 --> 03:09:58.500]  that a lot of people
[03:09:58.500 --> 03:10:00.500]  have fought and died for.
[03:10:00.500 --> 03:10:01.500]  Right, right.
[03:10:01.500 --> 03:10:02.500]  And one of the things
[03:10:02.500 --> 03:10:03.500]  I have learned,
[03:10:03.500 --> 03:10:04.500]  and I'm still learning,
[03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:05.500]  I'm always learning,
[03:10:05.500 --> 03:10:06.500]  but one of the things
[03:10:06.500 --> 03:10:07.500]  that I have learned,
[03:10:07.500 --> 03:10:08.500]  especially in the last,
[03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:09.500]  I'd say three to four years,
[03:10:09.500 --> 03:10:12.500]  despite all of my political background
[03:10:12.500 --> 03:10:14.500]  and organizing and blah, blah, blah,
[03:10:14.500 --> 03:10:17.500]  I've learned that it is important
[03:10:17.500 --> 03:10:19.500]  for me to reach out to other people,
[03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:21.500]  especially those people
[03:10:21.500 --> 03:10:23.500]  who don't think like me.
[03:10:23.500 --> 03:10:24.500]  Oh no, they want to keep us in boxes.
[03:10:24.500 --> 03:10:25.500]  Right, right.
[03:10:25.500 --> 03:10:27.500]  Okay, and I've learned
[03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:29.500]  that it's important for me
[03:10:29.500 --> 03:10:31.500]  to listen to that perspective.
[03:10:31.500 --> 03:10:33.500]  Because if I listen closely enough,
[03:10:33.500 --> 03:10:35.500]  I find out that there's a kernel
[03:10:35.500 --> 03:10:36.500]  in there that I agree with.
[03:10:36.500 --> 03:10:38.500]  I may not understand
[03:10:38.500 --> 03:10:40.500]  everything that someone is saying,
[03:10:40.500 --> 03:10:43.500]  but I can get where they're coming from.
[03:10:43.500 --> 03:10:45.500]  I can understand their pain
[03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:46.500]  because I feel that.
[03:10:46.500 --> 03:10:47.500]  And that's enlightening.
[03:10:47.500 --> 03:10:49.500]  Yes, yes, and empowering.
[03:10:49.500 --> 03:10:50.500]  I hate that word
[03:10:50.500 --> 03:10:52.500]  because it's so overused
[03:10:52.500 --> 03:10:54.500]  and misunderstood.
[03:10:54.500 --> 03:10:56.500]  But in the real sense of empowerment,
[03:10:56.500 --> 03:10:57.500]  that's empowering.
[03:10:57.500 --> 03:10:59.500]  Because when I,
[03:10:59.500 --> 03:11:00.500]  and I'm talking about
[03:11:00.500 --> 03:11:01.500]  from personal experience.
[03:11:01.500 --> 03:11:05.500]  Alex, three, four years ago,
[03:11:05.500 --> 03:11:06.500]  if someone had said to me,
[03:11:06.500 --> 03:11:08.500]  you know, you're going to be
[03:11:08.500 --> 03:11:11.500]  speaking with Alex Jones.
[03:11:11.500 --> 03:11:14.500]  I looked at them, I said, hmm, really?
[03:11:14.500 --> 03:11:17.500]  But the more I began to pay attention
[03:11:17.500 --> 03:11:18.500]  to info wars,
[03:11:18.500 --> 03:11:21.500]  and it is a war on for our minds.
[03:11:21.500 --> 03:11:23.500]  It is, I looked at that.
[03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:26.500]  I said, my God, that is correct.
[03:11:26.500 --> 03:11:28.500]  It's a war on for our minds.
[03:11:28.500 --> 03:11:30.500]  And when we understand this,
[03:11:30.500 --> 03:11:32.500]  we understand that we've got to
[03:11:32.500 --> 03:11:34.500]  do something about it.
[03:11:34.500 --> 03:11:35.500]  It's one thing to say,
[03:11:35.500 --> 03:11:36.500]  okay, it's a war on for our minds,
[03:11:36.500 --> 03:11:37.500]  but that's what you're doing.
[03:11:37.500 --> 03:11:38.500]  That's what info wars is doing.
[03:11:38.500 --> 03:11:40.500]  That's what the entire crew
[03:11:40.500 --> 03:11:42.500]  here at info wars is doing.
[03:11:42.500 --> 03:11:43.500]  Putting it out, food for thought.
[03:11:43.500 --> 03:11:45.500]  Everyone served that expression.
[03:11:45.500 --> 03:11:46.500]  Food for thought.
[03:11:46.500 --> 03:11:49.500]  So solutions, solutions.
[03:11:49.500 --> 03:11:51.500]  The solutions will not come
[03:11:51.500 --> 03:11:53.500]  from the top.
[03:11:53.500 --> 03:11:55.500]  They will come from the bottom.
[03:11:55.500 --> 03:11:56.500]  They will come from us.
[03:11:56.500 --> 03:11:58.500]  If we visualize a pyramid,
[03:11:58.500 --> 03:12:00.500]  what holds up that pyramid?
[03:12:00.500 --> 03:12:01.500]  That's why the system is obsessed
[03:12:01.500 --> 03:12:03.500]  with anything that's really grassroots
[03:12:03.500 --> 03:12:04.500]  and tries to take it over.
[03:12:04.500 --> 03:12:05.500]  That's right.
[03:12:05.500 --> 03:12:06.500]  Because the power is really there.
[03:12:06.500 --> 03:12:07.500]  That's right.
[03:12:07.500 --> 03:12:08.500]  And they know it, all right?
[03:12:08.500 --> 03:12:10.500]  The system knows it.
[03:12:10.500 --> 03:12:12.500]  The point is, it's time for us.
[03:12:12.500 --> 03:12:13.500]  That's why they're so scared
[03:12:13.500 --> 03:12:14.500]  of citizens with cameras
[03:12:14.500 --> 03:12:16.500]  and want to intimidate them.
[03:12:16.500 --> 03:12:18.500]  And by the way, it doesn't matter.
[03:12:18.500 --> 03:12:19.500]  And you're so right.
[03:12:19.500 --> 03:12:20.500]  I'm so glad you mentioned that, Alex.
[03:12:20.500 --> 03:12:22.500]  You're so right.
[03:12:22.500 --> 03:12:24.500]  It doesn't matter what the ideology
[03:12:24.500 --> 03:12:25.500]  or ideology is.
[03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:27.500]  I'm talking about these citizens
[03:12:27.500 --> 03:12:28.500]  with the cameras.
[03:12:28.500 --> 03:12:29.500]  They don't care.
[03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:31.500]  Right wing, left wing, liberal,
[03:12:31.500 --> 03:12:32.500]  whatever they call themselves.
[03:12:32.500 --> 03:12:33.500]  If you've got a camera,
[03:12:33.500 --> 03:12:34.500]  they're threatened.
[03:12:34.500 --> 03:12:35.500]  And they're not threatened
[03:12:35.500 --> 03:12:37.500]  by a big news truck ever,
[03:12:37.500 --> 03:12:38.500]  because they know that's on a leash.
[03:12:38.500 --> 03:12:40.500]  Yeah, they control that.
[03:12:40.500 --> 03:12:43.500]  ABC, NBC, Fox, PBS.
[03:12:43.500 --> 03:12:44.500]  Hey, who cares?
[03:12:44.500 --> 03:12:45.500]  Rob Dew got arrested
[03:12:45.500 --> 03:12:46.500]  on a hilltop in Pittsburgh
[03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:47.500]  with the media,
[03:12:47.500 --> 03:12:48.500]  showing them attacking
[03:12:48.500 --> 03:12:49.500]  peaceful demonstrators
[03:12:49.500 --> 03:12:50.500]  after the G20.
[03:12:50.500 --> 03:12:51.500]  And they came up the hill
[03:12:51.500 --> 03:12:52.500]  and got everybody
[03:12:52.500 --> 03:12:53.500]  that was mainstream media
[03:12:53.500 --> 03:12:54.500]  and said, you can go?
[03:12:54.500 --> 03:12:55.500]  And they arrested Dew
[03:12:55.500 --> 03:12:56.500]  and roughed him up.
[03:12:56.500 --> 03:12:58.500]  He won a lawsuit against him.
[03:12:58.500 --> 03:12:59.500]  But you're like,
[03:12:59.500 --> 03:13:00.500]  oh, you're within Fall Wars?
[03:13:00.500 --> 03:13:01.500]  You're going to jail, buddy.
[03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:02.500]  And you know what?
[03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:04.500]  That says that Infowars
[03:13:04.500 --> 03:13:06.500]  is doing something right
[03:13:06.500 --> 03:13:07.500]  in a big way.
[03:13:07.500 --> 03:13:09.500]  Right, correct, human.
[03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:11.500]  That's what I mean
[03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:12.500]  when I say the people struggle.
[03:13:12.500 --> 03:13:14.500]  I say keep it up.
[03:13:14.500 --> 03:13:16.500]  Kudos to Rob.
[03:13:16.500 --> 03:13:17.500]  Well, it shows the sides, though.
[03:13:17.500 --> 03:13:19.500]  It shows that they knew.
[03:13:19.500 --> 03:13:20.500]  Mainstream media is with us.
[03:13:20.500 --> 03:13:21.500]  Right.
[03:13:21.500 --> 03:13:22.500]  You see, he's there
[03:13:22.500 --> 03:13:23.500]  with this another expensive camera
[03:13:23.500 --> 03:13:24.500]  up on a hill just like they were.
[03:13:24.500 --> 03:13:25.500]  You're going to jail.
[03:13:25.500 --> 03:13:26.500]  We got the video.
[03:13:26.500 --> 03:13:28.500]  They go, get on your knees
[03:13:28.500 --> 03:13:30.500]  in America.
[03:13:30.500 --> 03:13:31.500]  And G20's over for half a day.
[03:13:31.500 --> 03:13:34.500]  They just wanted to go to attack
[03:13:34.500 --> 03:13:35.500]  some college kids that were out
[03:13:35.500 --> 03:13:36.500]  in the park.
[03:13:36.500 --> 03:13:37.500]  Of course, of course.
[03:13:37.500 --> 03:13:39.500]  And of course, the narrative
[03:13:39.500 --> 03:13:40.500]  is always reversed, isn't it?
[03:13:40.500 --> 03:13:41.500]  Think about it.
[03:13:41.500 --> 03:13:42.500]  It's the college kids.
[03:13:42.500 --> 03:13:43.500]  It's sort of like when,
[03:13:43.500 --> 03:13:46.500]  and I'm not saying this to all cops,
[03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:48.500]  but I personally experienced,
[03:13:48.500 --> 03:13:49.500]  and I know many, many people
[03:13:49.500 --> 03:13:51.500]  of all colors have experienced,
[03:13:51.500 --> 03:13:53.500]  it's like when some cops beat you up,
[03:13:53.500 --> 03:13:55.500]  then you end up charged with assault.
[03:13:55.500 --> 03:13:56.500]  Oh, it's on video all the time.
[03:13:56.500 --> 03:13:57.500]  I mean, it's not funny,
[03:13:57.500 --> 03:13:59.500]  but a sense of humor.
[03:13:59.500 --> 03:14:00.500]  Yeah, I mean, it's like,
[03:14:00.500 --> 03:14:01.500]  man, you're going to beat me up.
[03:14:01.500 --> 03:14:02.500]  That's one thing, but then you're
[03:14:02.500 --> 03:14:03.500]  going to bear false witness.
[03:14:03.500 --> 03:14:04.500]  Right.
[03:14:04.500 --> 03:14:05.500]  You're going to charge me
[03:14:05.500 --> 03:14:06.500]  with beating myself up.
[03:14:06.500 --> 03:14:08.500]  It's like, wow, that's deep.
[03:14:08.500 --> 03:14:09.500]  You know, but-
[03:14:09.500 --> 03:14:10.500]  And they'll still do it
[03:14:10.500 --> 03:14:11.500]  when there's footage of it.
[03:14:11.500 --> 03:14:12.500]  Yes.
[03:14:12.500 --> 03:14:13.500]  Yes.
[03:14:13.500 --> 03:14:14.500]  And the jury will go,
[03:14:14.500 --> 03:14:15.500]  well, you did raise your arm
[03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:16.500]  after he'd already hit you
[03:14:16.500 --> 03:14:17.500]  five times.
[03:14:17.500 --> 03:14:18.500]  That's assault to block the blow.
[03:14:18.500 --> 03:14:19.500]  Yes.
[03:14:19.500 --> 03:14:20.500]  Have you seen the new things
[03:14:20.500 --> 03:14:21.500]  where people are convicted
[03:14:21.500 --> 03:14:22.500]  where the cop's fist hits you,
[03:14:22.500 --> 03:14:23.500]  so his fist gets hurt
[03:14:23.500 --> 03:14:24.500]  and that's assaulting the cop?
[03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:25.500]  Ooh.
[03:14:25.500 --> 03:14:26.500]  No, no, that's like Israel
[03:14:26.500 --> 03:14:27.500]  and Syria.
[03:14:27.500 --> 03:14:29.500]  Israel's in the times of Israel.
[03:14:29.500 --> 03:14:32.500]  It says Israel will bring down Assad
[03:14:32.500 --> 03:14:33.500]  if he retaliates
[03:14:33.500 --> 03:14:34.500]  for further airstrikes.
[03:14:34.500 --> 03:14:35.500]  And they say,
[03:14:35.500 --> 03:14:36.500]  if you respond in any way,
[03:14:36.500 --> 03:14:38.500]  we will then carpet bomb you.
[03:14:38.500 --> 03:14:39.500]  That is sick.
[03:14:39.500 --> 03:14:40.500]  That is sick.
[03:14:40.500 --> 03:14:41.500]  Think about it.
[03:14:41.500 --> 03:14:42.500]  I'm going to bomb you,
[03:14:42.500 --> 03:14:43.500]  and if you respond,
[03:14:43.500 --> 03:14:45.500]  we're going to really invade you.
[03:14:45.500 --> 03:14:46.500]  Mm-hmm, which is what
[03:14:46.500 --> 03:14:48.500]  we want to do anyway, okay?
[03:14:48.500 --> 03:14:50.500]  But if you dare to defend yourself-
[03:14:50.500 --> 03:14:51.500]  Syria for two years
[03:14:51.500 --> 03:14:52.500]  is laying there and taking
[03:14:52.500 --> 03:14:53.500]  our government and others
[03:14:53.500 --> 03:14:54.500]  putting al-Qaeda in.
[03:14:54.500 --> 03:14:55.500]  Mm-hmm.
[03:14:55.500 --> 03:14:56.500]  You know the good news?
[03:14:56.500 --> 03:14:57.500]  I was reading the Israeli papers.
[03:14:57.500 --> 03:14:58.500]  Half the comments are going,
[03:14:58.500 --> 03:14:59.500]  you're defending al-Qaeda.
[03:14:59.500 --> 03:15:00.500]  Exactly.
[03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:01.500]  I mean, even the Israelis
[03:15:01.500 --> 03:15:02.500]  are going, this is wrong.
[03:15:02.500 --> 03:15:03.500]  Mm-hmm.
[03:15:03.500 --> 03:15:04.500]  I mean, it's like seeing Syria
[03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:05.500]  lay there for two years
[03:15:05.500 --> 03:15:06.500]  and take it is finally
[03:15:06.500 --> 03:15:07.500]  getting through to people.
[03:15:07.500 --> 03:15:08.500]  It is.
[03:15:08.500 --> 03:15:09.500]  It is, and that's-
[03:15:09.500 --> 03:15:10.500]  Syria's smart.
[03:15:10.500 --> 03:15:11.500]  Mm-hmm.
[03:15:11.500 --> 03:15:12.500]  I mean, you know, it's-
[03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:13.500]  What they're doing,
[03:15:13.500 --> 03:15:14.500]  their tactics,
[03:15:14.500 --> 03:15:15.500]  they're definitely smart
[03:15:15.500 --> 03:15:16.500]  because they,
[03:15:16.500 --> 03:15:17.500]  I think they understood.
[03:15:17.500 --> 03:15:18.500]  At least some of them-
[03:15:18.500 --> 03:15:19.500]  Well, no, it's admitted
[03:15:19.500 --> 03:15:20.500]  Assad reads infowars,
[03:15:20.500 --> 03:15:21.500]  and I'm not saying
[03:15:21.500 --> 03:15:22.500]  he's a great guy,
[03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:23.500]  but that's come out.
[03:15:23.500 --> 03:15:24.500]  It's not a question of
[03:15:24.500 --> 03:15:25.500]  great guy, I know great guy.
[03:15:25.500 --> 03:15:26.500]  It's a question of the people,
[03:15:26.500 --> 03:15:27.500]  the people.
[03:15:27.500 --> 03:15:28.500]  The people that struggle
[03:15:28.500 --> 03:15:29.500]  in Syria, of the people.
[03:15:29.500 --> 03:15:30.500]  Al-Qaeda is killing
[03:15:30.500 --> 03:15:31.500]  the Alawite minority.
[03:15:31.500 --> 03:15:32.500]  Exactly.
[03:15:32.500 --> 03:15:33.500]  And the Christian,
[03:15:33.500 --> 03:15:34.500]  lining them up and killing them,
[03:15:34.500 --> 03:15:35.500]  that's turning all the people,
[03:15:35.500 --> 03:15:37.500]  I've talked to high-level Sunnis
[03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:38.500]  who would be with the Sunnis
[03:15:38.500 --> 03:15:39.500]  that are doing this,
[03:15:39.500 --> 03:15:42.500]  but they're doing war crimes,
[03:15:42.500 --> 03:15:44.500]  so the Syrians are now
[03:15:44.500 --> 03:15:45.500]  unifying against it.
[03:15:45.500 --> 03:15:46.500]  Right, right.
[03:15:46.500 --> 03:15:47.500]  That's the power of the people.
[03:15:47.500 --> 03:15:48.500]  It's backfiring, though.
[03:15:48.500 --> 03:15:50.500]  Why do psychos always think
[03:15:50.500 --> 03:15:51.500]  beating us and attacking us
[03:15:51.500 --> 03:15:52.500]  is going to intimidate us?
[03:15:52.500 --> 03:15:53.500]  Because that's the way
[03:15:53.500 --> 03:15:55.500]  they figure that's what they think.
[03:15:55.500 --> 03:15:56.500]  Therefore, that's the way
[03:15:56.500 --> 03:15:57.500]  we think, but that's not
[03:15:57.500 --> 03:15:58.500]  the way we think.
[03:15:58.500 --> 03:16:00.500]  It's not the way we think.
[03:16:00.500 --> 03:16:01.500]  And we're not going to
[03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:02.500]  accept that narrative.
[03:16:02.500 --> 03:16:03.500]  We're going to be creative,
[03:16:03.500 --> 03:16:04.500]  and we're going to come up
[03:16:04.500 --> 03:16:05.500]  with our own narrative.
[03:16:05.500 --> 03:16:07.500]  And you know, I was thinking
[03:16:07.500 --> 03:16:08.500]  as you were talking about Syria,
[03:16:08.500 --> 03:16:09.500]  I was also thinking about
[03:16:09.500 --> 03:16:10.500]  the same thing that happened
[03:16:10.500 --> 03:16:11.500]  in Dibia.
[03:16:11.500 --> 03:16:12.500]  Same thing.
[03:16:12.500 --> 03:16:15.500]  And am I saying
[03:16:15.500 --> 03:16:17.500]  Gaddafi was good or bad?
[03:16:17.500 --> 03:16:18.500]  I'm not saying either.
[03:16:18.500 --> 03:16:19.500]  Well, he was actually
[03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:20.500]  good for Africa.
[03:16:20.500 --> 03:16:21.500]  You could say it was for ego
[03:16:21.500 --> 03:16:22.500]  or whatever.
[03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:23.500]  He gave most of the money
[03:16:23.500 --> 03:16:24.500]  to build up infrastructure,
[03:16:24.500 --> 03:16:25.500]  and he was actually
[03:16:25.500 --> 03:16:26.500]  good for the job.
[03:16:26.500 --> 03:16:27.500]  And he said the government's
[03:16:27.500 --> 03:16:28.500]  putting HIV in the shots,
[03:16:28.500 --> 03:16:29.500]  which they caught him.
[03:16:29.500 --> 03:16:30.500]  I got to say, you know,
[03:16:30.500 --> 03:16:32.500]  the fact is he was definitely
[03:16:32.500 --> 03:16:33.500]  becoming a good guy.
[03:16:33.500 --> 03:16:34.500]  That's why they did it.
[03:16:34.500 --> 03:16:36.500]  They got his money to invest.
[03:16:36.500 --> 03:16:37.500]  He came into the West,
[03:16:37.500 --> 03:16:39.500]  said, I want to be friends.
[03:16:39.500 --> 03:16:41.500]  See, you destabilize the region.
[03:16:41.500 --> 03:16:42.500]  I don't mean you, obviously.
[03:16:42.500 --> 03:16:43.500]  America.
[03:16:43.500 --> 03:16:44.500]  Yes.
[03:16:44.500 --> 03:16:46.500]  This corporate government
[03:16:46.500 --> 03:16:48.500]  destabilizes a region.
[03:16:48.500 --> 03:16:50.500]  There's a method to their madness.
[03:16:50.500 --> 03:16:51.500]  They are quite insane,
[03:16:51.500 --> 03:16:52.500]  by the way.
[03:16:52.500 --> 03:16:53.500]  But there's a method
[03:16:53.500 --> 03:16:54.500]  to their madness.
[03:16:54.500 --> 03:16:55.500]  You destabilize that region.
[03:16:55.500 --> 03:16:57.500]  You send it in like a cancer
[03:16:57.500 --> 03:17:01.500]  to infest the area.
[03:17:01.500 --> 03:17:04.500]  The last thing that, you know,
[03:17:04.500 --> 03:17:06.500]  the Obamatrons and the
[03:17:06.500 --> 03:17:08.500]  Republicans, Democrats,
[03:17:08.500 --> 03:17:09.500]  the last thing they want,
[03:17:09.500 --> 03:17:11.500]  the last thing they want
[03:17:11.500 --> 03:17:13.500]  is a stable country,
[03:17:13.500 --> 03:17:14.500]  a stable government.
[03:17:14.500 --> 03:17:15.500]  But Bush, just like
[03:17:15.500 --> 03:17:16.500]  Webster Tarpley and
[03:17:16.500 --> 03:17:17.500]  our other guests said
[03:17:17.500 --> 03:17:19.500]  and Professor Griff,
[03:17:19.500 --> 03:17:20.500]  in Obama Deception 1
[03:17:20.500 --> 03:17:21.500]  that we made five years ago,
[03:17:21.500 --> 03:17:23.500]  or four, five years ago,
[03:17:23.500 --> 03:17:24.500]  is that they got to have
[03:17:24.500 --> 03:17:25.500]  a black face to invade
[03:17:25.500 --> 03:17:26.500]  with Afrikan.
[03:17:26.500 --> 03:17:27.500]  And we even predicted
[03:17:27.500 --> 03:17:28.500]  they're going to take over Libya
[03:17:28.500 --> 03:17:29.500]  and then have al-Qaeda attack
[03:17:29.500 --> 03:17:31.500]  and then have the West
[03:17:31.500 --> 03:17:33.500]  invade Africa to kill al-Qaeda.
[03:17:33.500 --> 03:17:34.500]  But they won't even kill al-Qaeda.
[03:17:34.500 --> 03:17:36.500]  They'll kill the groups they want,
[03:17:36.500 --> 03:17:37.500]  knowing Americans can't even
[03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:38.500]  find Africa on a map.
[03:17:38.500 --> 03:17:39.500]  Exactly.
[03:17:39.500 --> 03:17:40.500]  And so it's like,
[03:17:40.500 --> 03:17:41.500]  we're killing al-Qaeda.
[03:17:41.500 --> 03:17:42.500]  Yeah.
[03:17:42.500 --> 03:17:43.500]  And meanwhile, the government
[03:17:43.500 --> 03:17:44.500]  put al-Qaeda in.
[03:17:44.500 --> 03:17:45.500]  Right.
[03:17:45.500 --> 03:17:46.500]  They developed al-Qaeda.
[03:17:46.500 --> 03:17:47.500]  They groomed al-Qaeda.
[03:17:47.500 --> 03:17:48.500]  They made al-Qaeda.
[03:17:48.500 --> 03:17:50.500]  They created al-Qaeda.
[03:17:50.500 --> 03:17:51.500]  They arm al-Qaeda.
[03:17:51.500 --> 03:17:52.500]  They put al-Qaeda in.
[03:17:52.500 --> 03:17:53.500]  Right.
[03:17:53.500 --> 03:17:54.500]  And then say,
[03:17:54.500 --> 03:17:55.500]  we're going to invade Africa
[03:17:55.500 --> 03:17:56.500]  to get al-Qaeda.
[03:17:56.500 --> 03:17:57.500]  Then they don't even go
[03:17:57.500 --> 03:17:58.500]  get al-Qaeda.
[03:17:58.500 --> 03:17:59.500]  They go kill the group
[03:17:59.500 --> 03:18:00.500]  fighting al-Qaeda.
[03:18:00.500 --> 03:18:01.500]  Of course.
[03:18:01.500 --> 03:18:02.500]  Of course.
[03:18:02.500 --> 03:18:03.500]  And again, I smile.
[03:18:03.500 --> 03:18:04.500]  It's not funny.
[03:18:04.500 --> 03:18:05.500]  It's sick.
[03:18:05.500 --> 03:18:06.500]  It's sick.
[03:18:06.500 --> 03:18:07.500]  It really is.
[03:18:07.500 --> 03:18:08.500]  It was an incredible
[03:18:08.500 --> 03:18:09.500]  crime against humanity
[03:18:09.500 --> 03:18:10.500]  to do that to Libya.
[03:18:10.500 --> 03:18:11.500]  Yes.
[03:18:11.500 --> 03:18:12.500]  But our power is,
[03:18:12.500 --> 03:18:13.500]  our power collectively,
[03:18:13.500 --> 03:18:14.500]  as a people, black, white,
[03:18:14.500 --> 03:18:15.500]  brown, red, yellow people,
[03:18:15.500 --> 03:18:16.500]  our power is knowledge.
[03:18:16.500 --> 03:18:17.500]  We know this.
[03:18:17.500 --> 03:18:18.500]  We know this.
[03:18:18.500 --> 03:18:19.500]  So what are we going
[03:18:19.500 --> 03:18:20.500]  to do about it?
[03:18:20.500 --> 03:18:21.500]  We're going to reach out.
[03:18:21.500 --> 03:18:22.500]  We're going to come up
[03:18:22.500 --> 03:18:23.780]  with ways and means.
[03:18:23.780 --> 03:18:24.780]  As Brother Malcolm said,
[03:18:24.780 --> 03:18:25.780]  we're going to go in the closet,
[03:18:25.780 --> 03:18:26.780]  but boy, when we come out
[03:18:26.780 --> 03:18:27.780]  of that closet,
[03:18:27.780 --> 03:18:28.780]  we're going to be united.
[03:18:28.780 --> 03:18:29.780]  And we're going to have
[03:18:29.780 --> 03:18:30.780]  our disagreements,
[03:18:30.780 --> 03:18:31.780]  though we're going to
[03:18:31.780 --> 03:18:32.780]  have them in the closet.
[03:18:32.780 --> 03:18:33.780]  Well, I mean, look,
[03:18:33.780 --> 03:18:34.780]  it's a crime to go
[03:18:34.780 --> 03:18:35.780]  to a stable country,
[03:18:35.780 --> 03:18:36.780]  destroy it,
[03:18:36.780 --> 03:18:37.780]  and then engage
[03:18:37.780 --> 03:18:38.780]  in ethnic cleansing
[03:18:38.780 --> 03:18:39.780]  of black Africans.
[03:18:39.780 --> 03:18:40.780]  40,000 climbed up
[03:18:40.780 --> 03:18:41.780]  and killed so far.
[03:18:41.780 --> 03:18:42.780]  Did that wake up
[03:18:42.780 --> 03:18:43.780]  the black community to Obama?
[03:18:43.780 --> 03:18:44.780]  I noticed it woke up Farrakhan.
[03:18:44.780 --> 03:18:45.780]  Yes.
[03:18:45.780 --> 03:18:46.780]  I mean, to a certain extent.
[03:18:46.780 --> 03:18:48.100]  I mean, he came out and criticized
[03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:50.100]  his brother Obama
[03:18:50.100 --> 03:18:51.100]  when they did that in Libya,
[03:18:51.100 --> 03:18:52.100]  but that really is a crime.
[03:18:52.100 --> 03:18:54.700]  Well, it woke up to some degree,
[03:18:54.700 --> 03:18:55.700]  some other folks too,
[03:18:55.700 --> 03:18:57.420]  such as Imari Baraka,
[03:18:57.420 --> 03:19:00.620]  aka Leroy Jones.
[03:19:00.620 --> 03:19:03.100]  But we'll see if it was genuine or not.
[03:19:03.100 --> 03:19:04.100]  I don't know.
[03:19:04.100 --> 03:19:05.100]  I can't say.
[03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:06.100]  Now, speaking for everyday,
[03:19:06.100 --> 03:19:09.220]  just everyday black folk,
[03:19:09.220 --> 03:19:10.500]  I think it is beginning
[03:19:10.500 --> 03:19:11.620]  to have an impact,
[03:19:11.620 --> 03:19:14.300]  especially among young blacks
[03:19:14.300 --> 03:19:15.300]  who are going,
[03:19:15.300 --> 03:19:16.300]  well, wait a minute,
[03:19:16.300 --> 03:19:17.300]  something doesn't compute here.
[03:19:17.300 --> 03:19:18.300]  We're over here.
[03:19:18.300 --> 03:19:19.300]  We're bombing,
[03:19:19.300 --> 03:19:20.660]  but somebody's got to tell them.
[03:19:20.660 --> 03:19:21.660]  That information
[03:19:21.660 --> 03:19:23.140]  has got to be gotten to them.
[03:19:23.140 --> 03:19:24.140]  They got to understand
[03:19:24.140 --> 03:19:25.460]  Libya is North Africa.
[03:19:25.460 --> 03:19:26.780]  They got to understand Somalia
[03:19:26.780 --> 03:19:28.180]  is East Africa.
[03:19:28.180 --> 03:19:29.420]  They've got to understand
[03:19:29.420 --> 03:19:31.500]  that what is going on.
[03:19:31.500 --> 03:19:33.020]  And when you look at Syria,
[03:19:33.020 --> 03:19:35.980]  where is Syria in relation to Africa?
[03:19:35.980 --> 03:19:37.580]  It's not on the African continent,
[03:19:37.580 --> 03:19:38.860]  but it's extremely close.
[03:19:38.860 --> 03:19:40.140]  But again, I'm not from Africa.
[03:19:40.140 --> 03:19:41.900]  Well, I guess originally everybody is,
[03:19:41.900 --> 03:19:43.740]  but the point is I have empathy.
[03:19:43.740 --> 03:19:45.580]  In fact, I would tell young black folks,
[03:19:45.580 --> 03:19:46.580]  why do you only care about
[03:19:46.580 --> 03:19:47.580]  something in Central Africa?
[03:19:47.580 --> 03:19:48.580]  Exactly.
[03:19:48.580 --> 03:19:49.580]  I mean, I care about
[03:19:49.580 --> 03:19:52.540]  the time in Libya or in or in Syria
[03:19:52.540 --> 03:19:56.300]  or in Jordan or or in the Balkans.
[03:19:56.300 --> 03:19:57.300]  Exactly.
[03:19:57.300 --> 03:19:58.300]  Exactly.
[03:19:58.300 --> 03:19:59.300]  I mean, I don't care
[03:19:59.300 --> 03:20:00.300]  who it's happening to.
[03:20:00.300 --> 03:20:01.300]  If it's wrong,
[03:20:01.300 --> 03:20:02.300]  we'll be right back.
[03:20:02.300 --> 03:20:03.300]  Let's do some more.
[03:20:03.300 --> 03:20:04.300]  Introducing pro wine.

[03:20:06.720 --> 03:20:08.940]  No more do you have two or three filters
[03:20:08.940 --> 03:20:11.300]  to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:20:11.300 --> 03:20:12.300]  You have a system
[03:20:12.300 --> 03:20:13.640]  that cuts out the sodium fluoride
[03:20:13.640 --> 03:20:17.220]  and up to 95% of hydrofluorosolic acid
[03:20:17.220 --> 03:20:19.580]  advanced manufacturing technology combines
[03:20:19.580 --> 03:20:21.660]  silver impregnated white ceramic
[03:20:21.660 --> 03:20:24.220]  with new aqua medics advanced media
[03:20:24.220 --> 03:20:25.540]  for removal of fluoride
[03:20:25.540 --> 03:20:26.540]  and other heavy metals
[03:20:26.540 --> 03:20:28.340]  all in one filter element.
[03:20:28.340 --> 03:20:29.980]  It is the only one that does it
[03:20:29.980 --> 03:20:31.200]  and out of the gates.

[03:20:44.300 --> 03:20:45.900]  Hydrofluorosolic acid,
[03:20:45.900 --> 03:20:47.500]  the most common form of fluoride
[03:20:47.500 --> 03:20:49.660]  not covered by other fluoride filter brands
[03:20:49.660 --> 03:20:52.220]  and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[03:21:01.460 --> 03:21:03.760]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[03:21:03.760 --> 03:21:04.920]  We have an alarm system
[03:21:04.920 --> 03:21:07.280]  and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[03:21:07.280 --> 03:21:08.480]  They kicked in our door
[03:21:08.480 --> 03:21:09.740]  and were in and out of our house
[03:21:09.740 --> 03:21:10.980]  in about five minutes.
[03:21:10.980 --> 03:21:13.160]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes,
[03:21:13.160 --> 03:21:14.560]  but they were long gone
[03:21:14.560 --> 03:21:17.020]  with our TV jewelry and my guns.
[03:21:17.020 --> 03:21:19.940]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[03:21:19.940 --> 03:21:21.240]  The police officer said
[03:21:21.240 --> 03:21:24.620]  that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door
[03:21:24.620 --> 03:21:27.460]  and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[03:21:27.460 --> 03:21:30.260]  The officer told me to go to easyarmor.net
[03:21:30.260 --> 03:21:31.180]  if we wanted something
[03:21:31.180 --> 03:21:33.280]  that would actually stop an intruder.

[03:21:42.460 --> 03:21:45.540]  and I installed Easy Armor in about 30 minutes.

[03:22:29.920 --> 03:22:31.220]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:31.220 --> 03:22:33.180]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers,
[03:22:33.180 --> 03:22:35.820]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:22:35.820 --> 03:22:37.740]  They've been available since 1986,
[03:22:37.740 --> 03:22:40.180]  yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[03:22:40.180 --> 03:22:41.620]  of gold for your retirement.
[03:22:41.620 --> 03:22:43.580]  Gold is outperform paper investments,
[03:22:43.580 --> 03:22:45.220]  yet no word about IRAs.
[03:22:45.220 --> 03:22:47.380]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement,

[03:23:21.900 --> 03:23:24.220]  pathogenic bacteria, cyst and parasites

[03:23:59.740 --> 03:24:06.740]  The final segment with Larry Pinkney,
[03:24:13.980 --> 03:24:15.840]  it's hard to get off air with him.
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:17.420]  And I think you're going to be on the nightly news,
[03:24:17.420 --> 03:24:18.880]  so I don't know if Jecari Jackson's doing it
[03:24:18.880 --> 03:24:20.420]  or who's doing it, but you're invited to that.
[03:24:20.420 --> 03:24:21.540]  I don't want to exhaust you too much.
[03:24:21.540 --> 03:24:24.660]  We're gonna get some good Austin Pollo Rico here,
[03:24:24.660 --> 03:24:27.000]  and then we're gonna do an interview
[03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:28.540]  for Obama Deception 2.
[03:24:28.540 --> 03:24:31.340]  Obama, as Cynthia McKinney has said, and others,
[03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:32.960]  it's not that he's a lesser of two evils,
[03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:34.380]  he's a more effective.
[03:24:34.380 --> 03:24:36.500]  And when the whole evil globalist culture
[03:24:36.500 --> 03:24:39.780]  says he's our savior, I knew, oh my gosh, get ready,
[03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:41.040]  they're gonna be able to run the whole thing here.
[03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:43.660]  But I knew about some of your early on past
[03:24:43.660 --> 03:24:45.560]  Marxist-Leninist type stuff, and people would ask me,
[03:24:45.560 --> 03:24:46.700]  why would you have Larry Pinkney on?
[03:24:46.700 --> 03:24:49.100]  Because I've watched over the years how you've expanded.
[03:24:49.100 --> 03:24:51.440]  You were describing it as populism,
[03:24:51.440 --> 03:24:54.260]  seeing these are all tools of control.
[03:24:54.260 --> 03:24:56.460]  What is your view now politically?
[03:24:56.460 --> 03:24:58.100]  Because now, go ahead.
[03:24:58.100 --> 03:25:00.500]  Yeah, well, as you and I were talking about, Alex,
[03:25:00.500 --> 03:25:03.180]  the bottom line is, yes, I studied Marx-Leninism,
[03:25:03.180 --> 03:25:08.180]  Marxist-Leninism, Maoism, yeah, I studied these things.
[03:25:08.260 --> 03:25:11.660]  But the more I began to, and that doesn't mean
[03:25:11.660 --> 03:25:15.180]  that I don't have some respect for some aspects,
[03:25:15.180 --> 03:25:18.300]  but I evolved, and I'm still evolving.
[03:25:18.300 --> 03:25:23.300]  I'm evolving into a people-ist, a populace,
[03:25:23.300 --> 03:25:26.700]  you see, any kind of ideology, be it right wing, left wing,
[03:25:26.700 --> 03:25:28.420]  or any- It's always gonna go to the individual.
[03:25:28.420 --> 03:25:30.060]  Yes, that's it.
[03:25:30.060 --> 03:25:32.900]  But it's an individualism where you love the individual,
[03:25:32.900 --> 03:25:37.060]  but then it creates a true diverse collectivism,
[03:25:37.060 --> 03:25:38.900]  not the false collectivism.
[03:25:38.900 --> 03:25:41.620]  Notice the big mega banks are always funding communism,
[03:25:41.620 --> 03:25:42.620]  just like Carol Quigley said,
[03:25:42.620 --> 03:25:46.500]  because it's another central control, like fascism.
[03:25:46.500 --> 03:25:48.940]  Have you evolved, and I'm not saying I have all the answers,
[03:25:48.940 --> 03:25:50.420]  but have you evolved to the fact that
[03:25:50.420 --> 03:25:52.220]  it's got to be individual,
[03:25:52.220 --> 03:25:54.360]  but individuals have to then band together,
[03:25:54.360 --> 03:25:57.620]  and that basically more of a real libertarian philosophy,
[03:25:57.620 --> 03:25:59.380]  not the fake corporatist,
[03:25:59.380 --> 03:26:01.460]  where it's a corporate collectivism.
[03:26:01.460 --> 03:26:02.780]  See, I mean, all these terms mean nothing.
[03:26:02.780 --> 03:26:03.620]  Right, right.
[03:26:03.620 --> 03:26:04.700]  How would you describe yourself now, then?
[03:26:04.700 --> 03:26:08.580]  I would describe myself as moving very strongly
[03:26:08.580 --> 03:26:12.260]  and quickly towards populism, all right?
[03:26:12.260 --> 03:26:15.220]  This is why it's so important for me to be able to speak
[03:26:15.220 --> 03:26:19.140]  and communicate with anyone from any ideology, any ideology.
[03:26:19.140 --> 03:26:23.220]  Okay, I refuse to be narrow.
[03:26:23.220 --> 03:26:25.100]  Oh, it's got to be a Marxist-Leninist.
[03:26:25.100 --> 03:26:27.180]  Oh, it's got to be dialectical materialism.
[03:26:27.180 --> 03:26:29.580]  Oh, it's got to be, it's like, please, please.
[03:26:29.580 --> 03:26:30.820]  You want to get out of the box.
[03:26:30.820 --> 03:26:33.060]  Yes, we've got to all get out of this box,
[03:26:33.060 --> 03:26:34.660]  if we really want change.
[03:26:34.660 --> 03:26:38.340]  Now, if we don't really want change, then stop the BS.
[03:26:38.340 --> 03:26:40.700]  Stop the BS, please, please, please.
[03:26:40.700 --> 03:26:43.400]  Be honest and say, I don't really want change.
[03:26:43.400 --> 03:26:44.520]  I'm comfortable where I am.
[03:26:44.520 --> 03:26:46.660]  I'm comfortable intellectually masturbating.
[03:26:46.660 --> 03:26:47.720]  I like that.
[03:26:47.720 --> 03:26:49.060]  Okay, be honest.
[03:26:49.060 --> 03:26:54.060]  But no, I believe that if we are going to have people change,
[03:26:54.820 --> 03:26:57.540]  then we'd better get the heck out of the box.
[03:26:57.540 --> 03:26:58.860]  The sooner, the better.
[03:26:58.860 --> 03:27:00.620]  Exactly, we don't want to replace
[03:27:00.620 --> 03:27:04.060]  one crony capitalist system with a crony communist system.
[03:27:04.060 --> 03:27:05.380]  We want to, I mean, I have to say,
[03:27:05.380 --> 03:27:08.020]  get back to the Enlightenment, the Renaissance.
[03:27:08.020 --> 03:27:10.040]  It's all about breaking up the cartels
[03:27:10.040 --> 03:27:11.140]  and empowering the individual.
[03:27:11.140 --> 03:27:11.960]  Right.
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:12.800]  And that's what they're scared of.
[03:27:12.800 --> 03:27:13.640]  Right.
[03:27:13.640 --> 03:27:15.600]  Carol Quigley said, we like fascism, we like communism,
[03:27:15.600 --> 03:27:17.180]  we like socialism, we like it all
[03:27:17.180 --> 03:27:20.100]  because we can buy off whoever's in charge.
[03:27:20.100 --> 03:27:21.680]  Just like they didn't like Gaddafi
[03:27:21.680 --> 03:27:23.540]  because he created a socialism,
[03:27:23.540 --> 03:27:26.200]  but it actually delivered 90% of the stuff
[03:27:26.200 --> 03:27:27.940]  to the people and built infrastructure.
[03:27:27.940 --> 03:27:30.540]  They want a communism where it's a bunch of royal commies
[03:27:30.540 --> 03:27:31.960]  up in their little command center.
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:33.940]  Everybody else are slaves.
[03:27:33.940 --> 03:27:37.460]  And that's, I think that's a very, very important point
[03:27:37.460 --> 03:27:38.460]  that you just made.
[03:27:38.460 --> 03:27:42.860]  You see, any kind of ism, capitalism, communism,
[03:27:42.860 --> 03:27:46.180]  socialism, ask yourself what they really mean.
[03:27:46.180 --> 03:27:48.020]  What does that really mean?
[03:27:48.020 --> 03:27:49.220]  It means, your description,
[03:27:49.220 --> 03:27:50.500]  I'm going to have to keep that one in mind,
[03:27:50.500 --> 03:27:53.420]  watch this program, because I like the way you describe that.
[03:27:53.420 --> 03:27:58.420]  They want a palatial elite, if you will.
[03:27:58.740 --> 03:28:01.280]  They don't mind if they have a palatial elite,
[03:28:01.280 --> 03:28:04.380]  whether they call it communism, capitalism, socialism,
[03:28:04.380 --> 03:28:07.500]  whatever other ism they're going to come up with next.
[03:28:07.500 --> 03:28:10.060]  But we, the people, have got to understand
[03:28:10.060 --> 03:28:12.980]  that if we are to really empower ourselves,
[03:28:12.980 --> 03:28:14.600]  I use that word again,
[03:28:14.600 --> 03:28:16.900]  but if we really do empower ourselves,
[03:28:16.900 --> 03:28:18.460]  we have to dispense with that.
[03:28:18.460 --> 03:28:20.020]  We have to reach out to each other.
[03:28:20.020 --> 03:28:20.860]  We have to be honest,
[03:28:20.860 --> 03:28:24.380]  which is why I began, earlier in this program,
[03:28:24.380 --> 03:28:28.480]  I began by saying, Alex, where is the so-called left now
[03:28:28.480 --> 03:28:32.340]  that drone man Obama is bombing and killing and maiming?
[03:28:32.340 --> 03:28:33.180]  Where is he?
[03:28:33.180 --> 03:28:34.700]  They feel like they're in charge now,
[03:28:34.700 --> 03:28:36.620]  reflected glory, so they bought into it.
[03:28:36.620 --> 03:28:37.460]  Right, right.
[03:28:37.460 --> 03:28:38.740]  So what is that?
[03:28:38.740 --> 03:28:40.060]  That's hypocrisy.
[03:28:40.060 --> 03:28:41.500]  That's deceit.
[03:28:41.500 --> 03:28:43.100]  It's hypocrisy.
[03:28:43.100 --> 03:28:44.820]  It's not being principled.
[03:28:44.820 --> 03:28:46.380]  We have got to be principled.
[03:28:46.380 --> 03:28:48.700]  That's more important than any idiot.
[03:28:48.700 --> 03:28:49.540]  Exactly.
[03:28:49.540 --> 03:28:50.900]  If a Republican was in charge doing this,
[03:28:50.900 --> 03:28:51.980]  I'd be against them.
[03:28:51.980 --> 03:28:53.940]  If people say, well, why are you bashing Obama?
[03:28:53.940 --> 03:28:56.060]  Well, back when I didn't like Bush, I was a communist.
[03:28:56.060 --> 03:28:57.400]  Now I don't like Obama.
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:28:59.300]  I'm a right-wing racist extremist.
[03:28:59.300 --> 03:29:00.300]  There's nothing to do with that.
[03:29:00.300 --> 03:29:01.860]  I want justice,
[03:29:01.860 --> 03:29:04.340]  and I want to get our Bill of Rights and Constitution back,
[03:29:04.340 --> 03:29:06.580]  and I want to get true independence back
[03:29:06.580 --> 03:29:08.560]  because it creates so much wealth.
[03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:11.740]  Our only problem is our kids become decadent slobs.
[03:29:11.740 --> 03:29:15.460]  I mean, nothing turns loose liberty
[03:29:15.460 --> 03:29:19.420]  like people being able to be upwardly mobile,
[03:29:19.420 --> 03:29:22.260]  and the mega cartels do everything they can to block that.
[03:29:22.260 --> 03:29:23.140]  We're out of time.
[03:29:23.140 --> 03:29:24.680]  Larry Pinckney will be back on the Nightly News.
[03:29:24.680 --> 03:29:26.100]  We're going to exhaust you today.
[03:29:26.100 --> 03:29:29.100]  We're going to interview you for Obama Deception 2 next,
[03:29:29.100 --> 03:29:30.620]  and then we're going to get you on the Nightly News
[03:29:30.620 --> 03:29:31.600]  if you want to do that,
[03:29:31.600 --> 03:29:33.140]  and it's just great meeting you in person.
[03:29:33.140 --> 03:29:34.260]  Thank you so much.
[03:29:34.260 --> 03:29:35.620]  You know I love being here.
[03:29:35.620 --> 03:29:36.840]  Absolutely, it's awesome.
[03:29:36.840 --> 03:29:41.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, blackactivistwg.org.
[03:29:41.220 --> 03:29:42.820]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[03:29:42.820 --> 03:29:45.140]  Go see the Mike Judge teaser.
[03:29:45.140 --> 03:29:46.700]  Oh, this is Hank Hill.
[03:29:46.700 --> 03:29:48.940]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[03:29:48.940 --> 03:29:50.440]  That's up on infowars.com.
[03:29:50.440 --> 03:29:51.820]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.820 --> 03:29:54.280]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.280 --> 03:30:12.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
