[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies born in domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:17.000 --> 00:27.680]  Hello my friends, it is Sunday, July 3rd, 2011, and we have got a jam-packed special
[00:27.680 --> 00:33.240]  broadcast for you on the eve of our nation's birthday.
[00:33.240 --> 00:41.640]  And it will be a transmission that is executed in the spirit of 1776.
[00:41.640 --> 00:47.920]  We have the extremely powerful interview from earlier last week with Congressman Ron
[00:47.920 --> 00:50.440]  Paul coming up.
[00:50.440 --> 00:56.320]  And if you've already heard this, great, please record it and send it on to friends
[00:56.320 --> 00:57.320]  and family.
[00:57.320 --> 01:03.440]  Congressman breaks down the fact that it is an impeachable offense that Obama has launched
[01:03.440 --> 01:10.160]  this war and not consulted Congress and instead said that he gets his power from the United
[01:10.160 --> 01:11.160]  Nations.
[01:11.160 --> 01:18.120]  Then we're going to retransmit an interview we did with Gerald Salente, where he covered
[01:18.120 --> 01:21.040]  the mafia government that we live under.
[01:21.040 --> 01:26.320]  And then we're going to rebroadcast an interview we did on Friday live from Tripoli where what
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.880]  looked like over a half million people took to the streets waving green banners and AK-47s
[01:31.880 --> 01:38.080]  and RPG rocket-propelled grenades saying we want peace, but this is a war you're bringing.
[01:38.080 --> 01:44.400]  And if your ground troops come in to Libya from NATO, it is going to be one hell of a
[01:44.400 --> 01:45.400]  battle.
[01:45.400 --> 01:47.920]  Folks, our country is going bankrupt.
[01:47.920 --> 01:49.640]  This war is for the banksters.
[01:49.640 --> 01:51.960]  We don't want to launch another war.
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.600]  We've already got four major wars going on.
[01:55.600 --> 02:00.680]  This is an extremely powerful interview with the chanting going on on the gunfire in the
[02:00.680 --> 02:02.560]  background.
[02:02.560 --> 02:08.240]  Then we're going to air for the first time on radio in its entirety with some introductions
[02:08.240 --> 02:09.680]  I did as well.
[02:09.680 --> 02:16.600]  The 30-minute long, so we'll do it in the last three segments of the broadcast, the 30-minute
[02:16.600 --> 02:24.840]  long keynote speech I gave at Talkers, which is the premier industry publication, Rush
[02:24.840 --> 02:30.640]  Limbaugh, one of the previous keynote speakers, Sean Hannity, and many others.
[02:30.640 --> 02:37.600]  And so it's a testament to the great effect that all of us have had together in getting
[02:37.600 --> 02:43.480]  the word out that now my radio show is being put on so many big establishment AM&FM stations
[02:43.480 --> 02:48.600]  that are owned by smaller media groups, but still big marquee stations.
[02:48.600 --> 02:55.720]  It shows that we are really mainlining what America is all about, property rights, the
[02:55.720 --> 03:01.040]  Second Amendment, liberty, and facing the globalist onslaught, the fact that world government,
[03:01.040 --> 03:08.160]  a globalist, non-free market, corporatist government that's being set up.
[03:08.160 --> 03:15.560]  This speech is different because I was reaching out and addressing the radio CEOs, the talk
[03:15.560 --> 03:20.640]  show hosts, the Congress people, folks like Stephen Baldwin and others, a very diverse
[03:20.640 --> 03:24.000]  crowd of media folks that were there.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.600]  And I was specifically talking to them, and in most speeches I'm talking just to the
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.000]  general public, and a lot of times I feel like I'm just musing to myself about the way
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  the world works.
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.560]  So this is something a little bit different, and folks think it's a great speech.
[03:36.560 --> 03:42.760]  I thought it was okay, but the reviews of it have been incredibly positive by listeners,
[03:42.760 --> 03:44.280]  so if you've missed that.
[03:44.280 --> 03:48.200]  It's on PrismPlanet.tv with the video, and it's been up there for a couple weeks now,
[03:48.200 --> 03:53.720]  but we're going to premiere that on the radio waves coming up in the last, I don't know,
[03:53.720 --> 03:57.920]  40 minutes or so of the broadcast, it's 30 minutes long, but with commercials it's about
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.720]  the last 40 minutes of the show today, so that is coming up.
[04:02.720 --> 04:07.360]  I want everybody to be really safe out there with all the drunk drivers and all the checkpoints
[04:07.360 --> 04:12.520]  and things that are going on in the country, and let's hopefully have a great, healthy,
[04:12.520 --> 04:18.480]  and happy and wonderful 4th of July with our families, and let's enjoy firecrackers while
[04:18.480 --> 04:25.160]  they still are legal in many areas of the country, and we'll see you all back here on
[04:25.160 --> 04:30.960]  Monday, 11 a.m. Central Standard Time, so coming up, Congressman Ron Paul, on a host
[04:30.960 --> 04:36.400]  of key issues in his presidential run, Gerald Solente, Webster Griffin Tarpley from Tripoli,
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.120]  and the Talkers keynote speech, I want to thank the great crew as well for putting
[04:40.120 --> 04:44.920]  together this special broadcast for you today.
[04:44.920 --> 04:49.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, humanity is at a historic crossroads.
[04:49.040 --> 04:52.840]  We're deciding the future of our species, our civilization.
[04:52.840 --> 04:59.520]  Liberty, in the spirit of 1776, or tyranny, we'll be right back.
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.640]  A US and or subject to other police action.
[05:03.640 --> 05:04.640]  Tyranny is here.
[05:04.640 --> 05:08.520]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[05:08.520 --> 05:10.920]  It really says that the state is God.
[05:10.920 --> 05:15.440]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[05:15.440 --> 05:16.720]  on earth.
[05:16.720 --> 05:21.520]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[05:21.520 --> 05:23.360]  expanded nationwide.
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.600]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[05:27.600 --> 05:29.400]  powerful shadow state.
[05:29.400 --> 05:33.880]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[05:33.880 --> 05:39.640]  There to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras,
[05:39.640 --> 05:43.720]  citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[05:43.720 --> 05:47.240]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[05:47.240 --> 05:49.280]  The police state isn't coming.
[05:49.280 --> 05:50.280]  It's here.

[06:02.120 --> 06:08.280]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[06:08.280 --> 06:16.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:16.040 --> 06:19.720]  Well we've got Congressman Ron Paul for the next 20 minutes and I know he's the hardest
[06:19.720 --> 06:25.360]  working person in Congress and I feel a little guilty taking his time up but he's got so
[06:25.360 --> 06:29.960]  much important information and I know our audience is always chomping at the bit whenever
[06:29.960 --> 06:35.200]  he joins us normally every month but now every couple of months because he's so busy and
[06:35.200 --> 06:38.120]  I've got a whole cornucopia of things to cover here.
[06:38.120 --> 06:43.400]  The wars, the constitutional crisis, the TSA, the dirty tricks, the media's been running
[06:43.400 --> 06:47.680]  on Ron Paul and he's a good sportsman so he never really talks about it but I think it
[06:47.680 --> 06:53.040]  needs to be discussed but obviously he's a presidential candidate, he's the only candidate
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.600]  that is a constitutionalist and that has the solutions to help get this country on the
[06:57.600 --> 07:03.960]  right track. All the others are rhinos or globalists or neocons and we've got to get
[07:03.960 --> 07:09.640]  behind Ron Paul but thank God he ran for president because by running he's injecting real issues.
[07:09.640 --> 07:11.880]  We've got him for the next 20 minutes and then he's gone.
[07:11.880 --> 07:17.600]  Sir, there's so much to cover but the Financial Times says the dollar is seen losing global
[07:17.600 --> 07:24.080]  reserve status. The bankers are engaged in economic terrorism in Greece. Now they're saying
[07:24.080 --> 07:29.360]  it's going to spread here, the recession never ended. You've been proven right again sir.
[07:29.360 --> 07:33.280]  What can you say because you're on the banking committees, what can you say about the state
[07:33.280 --> 07:34.920]  of the world economy right now?
[07:34.920 --> 07:39.480]  I think it's sick and getting sicker. I did read one article you probably saw today. They
[07:39.480 --> 07:44.120]  said that the dollar, the reserve standard as the reserve standard of the world will
[07:44.120 --> 07:50.520]  be coming to an end and they added within 25 years. I would suggest that it's going
[07:50.520 --> 07:55.560]  to come much sooner. I just don't believe it'll last for 25 years where it'll be the
[07:55.560 --> 08:00.000]  dominant reserve currency of the world. The big problem though is who's going to pick
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.880]  up the pieces? They're getting together and they're trying to have another international
[08:04.880 --> 08:09.600]  paper currency put together but then they throw out a few tidbits and say, well, maybe
[08:09.600 --> 08:17.720]  we ought to put a little bit of gold into that as well but the problems we have are
[08:17.720 --> 08:23.640]  really very overwhelming. They cannot sustain this. I would say it's not going to be 25
[08:23.640 --> 08:29.120]  years but I don't know. Nobody knows exactly the date but it could come sooner. A lot sooner
[08:29.120 --> 08:35.720]  could come a year or two or who knows when. It depends on what event might arise. The
[08:35.720 --> 08:41.000]  problem they face is the one that we face in trying to figure it out is the dollar is
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.040]  a terrible currency but when you compare it to the euro that has to bail out the Greek
[08:46.040 --> 08:51.480]  economy, all of a sudden people look to us because traditionally we've been so strong
[08:51.480 --> 08:55.320]  economically and militarily. They say, well, at least we can park our money in treasury
[08:55.320 --> 09:00.640]  bills for another month or two or three. Someday they're going to run out of this in the momentum
[09:00.640 --> 09:06.320]  way against the dollar and not too many years ago the dollar got in big trouble and we had
[09:06.320 --> 09:12.840]  to go beg into the IMF and that was in 79 and 80. People thought it would lose control
[09:12.840 --> 09:17.680]  but the time is coming and that will be a much bigger event than we've just experienced
[09:17.680 --> 09:24.400]  from 08 up until now and the current crisis that we're in the middle of because I think
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.080]  it will just drive us that much deeper into an economic crisis.
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.880]  Well, the Chinese, as you know, just two weeks ago said the United States has already technically
[09:32.880 --> 09:37.960]  defaulted. The Federal Reserve is buying most of the T-bills and for the average layman
[09:37.960 --> 09:41.640]  out there they're like, why does that concern me? Well, that's the faith and credit of the
[09:41.640 --> 09:46.240]  United States and that's a tactic I've seen where they'll say 10 years, 25 on something
[09:46.240 --> 09:51.880]  that's going to happen to introduce the idea to you so you accept it but don't panic. A
[09:51.880 --> 09:55.640]  lot of the experts I read and who've been accurate in the past, they say two, three
[09:55.640 --> 10:01.080]  years but then they point out it's a global concerted devaluation so it's not even that
[10:01.080 --> 10:04.400]  the dollar is going to lose its reserve, it's just going to lose its value.
[10:04.400 --> 10:10.160]  That's right and, you know, they're trying to frighten the members of Congress into,
[10:10.160 --> 10:13.400]  you know, voting to raise the debt limit like they did about the bailout. You know, the
[10:13.400 --> 10:18.400]  end of the world will come. There will be a default but the default is, I mean, our
[10:18.400 --> 10:22.320]  country is known for default. I mean, all the way back to the Civil War period they
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.880]  defaulted on promising to pay gold. We did it in the 30s with Roosevelt. Then we did
[10:27.880 --> 10:33.760]  it to all foreigners in 1971. We just say, well, no, yes, we promised you an ounce of
[10:33.760 --> 10:39.720]  gold for $35 but we're not going to do it anymore. So, and even now they keep saying
[10:39.720 --> 10:43.960]  well, you have to raise it because we don't want a default on the debt. But if prices
[10:43.960 --> 10:49.360]  are going up for the average person, which they are, and they're probably going up five
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.640]  to 10% at least at the minimum, somebody's defaulting constantly. That means they're
[10:54.640 --> 11:00.440]  losing 10 cents on the dollar every year. It'll get much worse. So that is the default
[11:00.440 --> 11:04.600]  but that's the deception. Matter of fact, it's deliberate policy because they know
[11:04.600 --> 11:08.400]  what we know. They know that debt can't be paid. There's no way they can meet their
[11:08.400 --> 11:12.560]  debt. There's not enough people working to pay off the debt. But the private central
[11:12.560 --> 11:17.880]  banks, they get first use on the money and so they're more than happy. And as we get
[11:17.880 --> 11:22.160]  more bankrupt, they're going to be there, loaning us whatever the new currency system
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.960]  is in the future. So they come out on top with their new, vaunted bank of the world
[11:26.960 --> 11:33.080]  that George Soros says is going to save us. And they pay 0% interest on it and then they
[11:33.080 --> 11:38.880]  buy some of this government debt and do these kinds of things and they make 2%, 3%, 4%, but
[11:38.880 --> 11:42.600]  if you're retired and think you have this obligation to take care of yourself and say,
[11:42.600 --> 11:47.800]  well, I'm going to have a CD because I can't trust the stocks or anything else. They get
[11:47.800 --> 11:52.360]  cheated because they make essentially nothing on their savings and then they have to pay
[11:52.360 --> 11:57.280]  taxes on it. Then they wonder why the people don't take better care of themselves. But
[11:57.280 --> 12:02.280]  it's a deeply flawed system. It's a deeply flawed system of money and the welfareism
[12:02.280 --> 12:07.160]  and central economic planning through the Federal Reserve. It's all deeply flawed and
[12:07.160 --> 12:11.840]  though many of us have talked about this for many, many years, it's coming to fruition
[12:11.840 --> 12:16.960]  and most people are realizing it. It's also the reason that especially the young people
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.440]  are realizing how much they're being dumped on. And I know you reach a lot of young people
[12:21.440 --> 12:27.640]  as well talking to how they're getting ripped off because there's no way, even if they
[12:27.640 --> 12:31.000]  could get a good job, they can't pay off these obligations, but they're not getting
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.120]  really good jobs that we are really, really facing a major problem and it has to be a
[12:36.120 --> 12:38.680]  dollar price that's coming in our future.
[12:38.680 --> 12:43.240]  Well, what about Bernanke last week saying he's puzzled that the economy isn't getting
[12:43.240 --> 12:48.100]  better. You, with total precision, have predicted exactly what would happen because it's sound
[12:48.100 --> 12:53.320]  laws of economics. Bernanke knows full well, as you just said, they know what they're doing
[12:53.320 --> 12:58.280]  and telling us we're not in a recession. I mean, that's another lie. Congressman, shifting
[12:58.280 --> 13:04.680]  gears into the campaign. You are the only candidate decades ago telling the truth about
[13:04.680 --> 13:09.040]  issues. Now in the presidential race, the only one who's telling the truth and who has the
[13:09.040 --> 13:15.280]  track record to be trusted, Mitt Romney, helped write what became Obamacare, the rest of them.
[13:15.280 --> 13:21.760]  I mean, this is a pack of people who are just completely unqualified at this point. We've
[13:21.760 --> 13:29.200]  got CNN ignoring their own polls and running internet polls with 54 people and then showing
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.720]  you for zero in their own poll show that you won. You're winning most of the straw polls.
[13:33.720 --> 13:38.120]  Second, New Hampshire. I hear mainline conservative radio talking about Republican candidates.
[13:38.120 --> 13:44.200]  They won't even mention you. Despite the fact that you're right there in the top three candidates,
[13:44.200 --> 13:49.240]  that shows that the system is scared of you. What can you say to the dirty tricks that
[13:49.240 --> 13:51.000]  they've been trying to pull on you?
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.080]  I don't think you could stop them. I mean, they have too much power and control because
[13:56.080 --> 14:01.480]  they own the media and they own a lot of these outlets. So talking to people like you that
[14:01.480 --> 14:06.480]  will get the truth out, but also the internet is a good way to do this. But as bad as the
[14:06.480 --> 14:12.160]  system is, it still operates reasonably well. That is that over the years, I've been able
[14:12.160 --> 14:18.960]  to run for Congress and get elected and now I am still able to compete even up against
[14:18.960 --> 14:25.200]  these odds and these tricks because we can get in and organize and our numbers are growing.
[14:25.200 --> 14:30.720]  We're able to raise the money that is necessary and we continue to do that as long as we keep
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.320]  adding volunteers and able to raise the money. We are going to compete, but obviously it
[14:35.320 --> 14:40.600]  is more difficult because there's still a large number of people. Not even the majority
[14:40.600 --> 14:47.520]  get their information from the evening news, the ordinary news, and from their politicians.
[14:47.520 --> 14:52.520]  They can discredit you. You don't get credibility. And last but not least, the first two major
[14:52.520 --> 14:58.720]  debates, one right before Iowa and one before New Hampshire, they excluded me from the debates.
[14:58.720 --> 15:04.600]  This year, they're not going to be able to do it. We have made progress and that's been
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.760]  because there's a growing number of people who are on to their tricks and are watching
[15:08.760 --> 15:13.480]  them rather closely and they're going to hear from the supporters if they start doing that.
[15:13.480 --> 15:19.600]  So in spite of the obstacles, our job is to keep doing what we're doing and just gain
[15:19.600 --> 15:20.600]  supporters.
[15:20.600 --> 15:25.040]  Well, I want to talk about some of the things on the positive front and specifically the
[15:25.040 --> 15:29.160]  websites and how people need to get involved now, but you at the start of the race last
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.280]  time weren't even in the top 10, then you were in the top four or five. Now out of the
[15:33.280 --> 15:36.800]  gauge you're winning most of the straw polls. You've won the big coveted CPAC two years

[17:00.840 --> 17:08.400]  You're out on the road. The last place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate
[17:08.400 --> 17:12.400]  happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[17:12.400 --> 17:21.560]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They're so
[17:21.560 --> 17:31.000]  bright in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset
[17:31.000 --> 17:39.400]  in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[17:39.400 --> 17:46.200]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[17:46.200 --> 17:50.760]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you could
[17:50.760 --> 17:58.040]  ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[17:58.040 --> 18:00.040]  Others don't.
[18:00.040 --> 18:04.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[18:04.680 --> 18:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.320]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[18:13.320 --> 18:18.400]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[18:18.400 --> 18:23.040]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.640]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[18:28.640 --> 18:33.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.660]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[18:37.660 --> 18:41.880]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[18:41.880 --> 18:45.920]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can
[18:45.920 --> 18:52.680]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[18:52.680 --> 19:00.760]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[19:00.760 --> 19:05.040]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[19:05.040 --> 19:09.640]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions. Yet, many are unaware of the entire function
[19:09.640 --> 19:13.480]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[19:13.480 --> 19:18.960]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver
[19:18.960 --> 19:23.640]  Lungs generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and
[19:23.640 --> 19:29.280]  ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[19:29.280 --> 19:35.120]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[19:35.120 --> 19:41.800]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure
[19:41.800 --> 19:48.880]  to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[19:48.880 --> 19:53.960]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works. As well, we are always ready to answer
[19:53.960 --> 20:17.440]  any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[20:17.440 --> 20:24.440]  You know, although the Congress is waking up and there's a pretty good coalition of liberals
[20:24.440 --> 20:26.200]  and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats coming together and trying to blow this thing
[20:26.200 --> 20:31.080]  up and say the President has no right to do this, at the same time on this DOD budget
[20:31.080 --> 20:37.600]  authorization, you know, they inserted in there an expansion of the power. Actually,
[20:37.600 --> 20:43.240]  if it's passed by the Senate and put in the law, we've literally legalized, we put into
[20:43.240 --> 20:48.000]  the code, even though not at the Constitution, put into the code that the President doesn't
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.120]  have to come to us. They've expanded the definition of our enemy today. It's al-Qaeda
[20:53.120 --> 20:57.920]  and they're allowed to do almost anything there, but they've expanded it. It can include
[20:57.920 --> 21:03.720]  the Taliban and anything which is considered an associated force. The associated force
[21:03.720 --> 21:08.360]  is the President has the right to go after it no matter what country or including our
[21:08.360 --> 21:17.360]  own. So, this to me was one of the most dangerous changes in our law, given legitimacy to our
[21:17.360 --> 21:22.200]  President on what he's been doing. And of course, there's not much resistance either
[21:22.200 --> 21:27.240]  from the Republicans or the Democrats on this, but hopefully we can wake the American people
[21:27.240 --> 21:28.480]  up to that change.
[21:28.480 --> 21:35.040]  What about Obama, admittedly, going to have feds posed as people calling doctors to see
[21:35.040 --> 21:39.520]  if they're taking Medicare, Medicaid patients, which is their right to not do, as you know.
[21:39.520 --> 21:43.800]  This is really freaking doctors out that now the feds are going to be spying, spying on
[21:43.800 --> 21:44.800]  them.
[21:44.800 --> 21:51.800]  Yes, and I would assume that most people don't realize that's against the law to do
[21:51.800 --> 21:57.080]  those kind of things. I mean, why should they violate the privacy of a doctor-patient
[21:57.080 --> 22:02.480]  relationship and come in and fake it's fraud, it's deceitful, and what kind of punishment
[22:02.480 --> 22:06.520]  might these doctors-what did the doctor say? I don't take medical care patients, you know.
[22:06.520 --> 22:13.520]  Who knows what kind of list you get put on there. But no, that's just one thing leads
[22:13.520 --> 22:17.600]  to the next, always an unintended consequence, everything. Every time the government does
[22:17.600 --> 22:20.080]  one thing and it creates two or three new problems.
[22:20.080 --> 22:23.520]  Congressman, just a couple questions left here, and then we're going to ask you how
[22:23.520 --> 22:29.080]  we support the campaign again. Operation Fast and Furious just remind listeners, the head
[22:29.080 --> 22:32.680]  of the ATF caught-line to Congress saying he didn't know. Now we have the emails and
[22:32.680 --> 22:37.280]  memorandum, they were running the operation to ship guns into Mexico to then claim that
[22:37.280 --> 22:42.320]  we're causing the violence down there, a form of false flag, a staged event to frame the
[22:42.320 --> 22:48.520]  Second Amendment, that he's caught-line. Can you or others call for congressional hearings
[22:48.520 --> 22:55.320]  and haul these people up and expose what the dreaded ATF has done?
[22:55.320 --> 23:00.920]  Well, I'm sure that would be legitimate if somebody so motivated I don't happen to be
[23:00.920 --> 23:06.360]  on that particular committee. But yes, government oversight could do that, they could call up
[23:06.360 --> 23:11.320]  and get to the bottom of it. But I haven't heard a whole lot talk, I don't have any
[23:11.320 --> 23:16.240]  special information on that, but they certainly can and they certainly should.
[23:16.240 --> 23:21.280]  In closing on the political issues, there's new reports out in mainstream television and
[23:21.280 --> 23:28.920]  newspapers that cancer is surging in body scan operators. The TSA at the Boston Airport
[23:28.920 --> 23:33.160]  where it's been for seven years, they've had an internal cover-up of the fact that
[23:33.160 --> 23:37.720]  they know that radiation is leaking out of these. Could this be the nail in the coffin
[23:37.720 --> 23:45.080]  of this federal TSA that they knowingly are not following radiation rules or radiology
[23:45.080 --> 23:47.520]  rules that you'd follow in your practice?
[23:47.520 --> 23:51.960]  Well, this hopes so, but isn't it sad that they have to come to that conclusion after
[23:51.960 --> 23:57.720]  somebody's made sick or get cancer? But the big thing is, we've got to get the government
[23:57.720 --> 24:01.120]  out of that business so if they get rid of the machines, then they're going to do a lot
[24:01.120 --> 24:07.200]  more probing and prodding and poking everybody. So it's really tragic. I think what's happening
[24:07.200 --> 24:13.760]  at airports is the litmus test. If the American people sit back and look at some of those
[24:13.760 --> 24:20.600]  pictures and not be outraged and not demanding changes, when I see that, that's when I have
[24:20.600 --> 24:24.960]  some pessimistic thoughts about what's going to happen in this country. So there's hope
[24:24.960 --> 24:31.920]  that those pictures will so outrage the people that will end up doing something about it.
[24:31.920 --> 24:36.800]  Speaking of the TSA, I've got sources inside the Perry campaign and at Fox News. As you
[24:36.800 --> 24:40.360]  know, Rick Perry, the governor, is planning to run. I would imagine you've got the same
[24:40.360 --> 24:44.640]  intel and he's going to run on a Ron Paul platform. So he's really going to be the
[24:44.640 --> 24:51.160]  guy you face from our analysis and Rick Perry quietly tried to kill the good bill. They've
[24:51.160 --> 24:57.800]  rewritten it where it actually puts in the code that the TSA can do this now in Texas
[24:57.800 --> 25:02.960]  and they're calling it an anti-TSA bill, kind of like what we saw with the war powers, double
[25:02.960 --> 25:06.600]  speak of saying they're against what Obama's doing, but trying to give him the power.
[25:06.600 --> 25:12.280]  That's typical. That's why you can never look what they do on the surface. When people
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.000]  want something done, they'll pass the bill and it'll do the opposite, whether it was
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.400]  the war powers resolution or this recent episode of that bill they tried to pass, which literally
[25:20.400 --> 25:25.400]  legalized the war. So yes, that's what they do and then they claim victory.
[25:25.400 --> 25:27.240]  What's your view of Perry?
[25:27.240 --> 25:28.240]  What's your view of Perry?
[25:28.240 --> 25:34.000]  Well, I might have taken hands with him, but I don't remember that. So I've never, I don't
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  know him well personally, but I would think that he and I wouldn't have much in agreement
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  on policies.
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  Well, he was Al Gore's former campaign manager in Texas. I don't think that's a very good
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000] ...
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  I don't tell a few people something.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.440]  Well, Congressman, you seemed really happy because you're always so focused because I
[25:54.440 --> 25:57.440]  know you're a very disciplined man, but when I talked to you in the break before you came
[25:57.440 --> 26:03.120]  live, I don't think I've ever heard you so happy. Am I right in that? I mean, you said,
[26:03.120 --> 26:06.560]  well, I'm sad for the country, but overall, I'm happy that folks are starting to wake
[26:06.560 --> 26:07.960]  up. I mean, you are happy.
[26:07.960 --> 26:15.040]  Yeah, I am. And things personally with family and everything has been going pretty well.
[26:15.040 --> 26:18.200]  And that's what, I guess, cheers me up.
[26:18.200 --> 26:22.160]  Well, thank you, sir. In closing, what... I mean, because I've got millions of listeners,
[26:22.160 --> 26:27.000]  a lot of new big stations across the country. We're not talking to just a million every
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.800]  day. We're talking to three million every day on the radio alone, not just Internet
[26:30.800 --> 26:35.080]  operator. We're reaching about 10 million a week. Talking to the millions of new listeners
[26:35.080 --> 26:39.720]  who've never heard you in a long form. They've heard you on TV being interrupted constantly.
[26:39.720 --> 26:45.960]  What can they do to be part of this Second American Revolution or the restoration of
[26:45.960 --> 26:52.080]  the Republic? Give us the orders from headquarters. What do we do to supercharge a campaign that's
[26:52.080 --> 26:54.080]  already on fire?
[26:54.080 --> 26:59.840]  Well, in very general terms, slightly separate from the campaign, what everybody has to
[26:59.840 --> 27:04.160]  do is be informed. Get the information and find out where the problem is and what the
[27:04.160 --> 27:08.360]  answers are and why philosophy is important. When they're informed, then they have to do
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.560]  something. And they can make choices. They can get involved directly. They can become
[27:12.560 --> 27:16.880]  candidates or support candidates. They can get into education. They can get radio talk
[27:16.880 --> 27:20.680]  shows. They can get on the Internet to promote this message.
[27:20.680 --> 27:27.040]  But then when it comes more specific for what I've been doing, you know, we had the educational
[27:27.040 --> 27:31.760]  opportunities through my foundation as well as Campaign for Liberty. But right now, we
[27:31.760 --> 27:36.400]  are very much engaged in the presidential campaign. People who are interested in that
[27:36.400 --> 27:43.440]  can go to RonPaul2012.com and find out what they can do because that's where we need to
[27:43.440 --> 27:50.160]  help. We need people to volunteer. We need to raise money. And right now, the next big
[27:50.160 --> 27:56.280]  event for us is to try to find people in Iowa. If anybody knows anybody in Iowa that would
[27:56.280 --> 28:00.400]  be willing to support us and make an effort and come out on August 13th, that would be
[28:00.400 --> 28:01.800]  very helpful to us.
[28:01.800 --> 28:05.800]  And when's the next money bomb? And folks can give right now at RonPaul2012.com.
[28:05.800 --> 28:11.120]  Well, there is an effort right now because on the 30th of this month, the books close.
[28:11.120 --> 28:16.960]  And you know, there's a big... That report is significant because it will be blasted
[28:16.960 --> 28:21.760]  all over the country on who raised what. And we won't be the biggest fundraiser, but we're
[28:21.760 --> 28:27.240]  going to have raised a lot. But they were trying to push for, you know, first for three,
[28:27.240 --> 28:31.880]  then somebody said, maybe we can raise five. And I think it's not quite at four million
[28:31.880 --> 28:36.600]  right now. So the next couple of days, we're hoping to boost that up and have a good showing
[28:36.600 --> 28:39.200]  for the financial report for this quarter.
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.400]  All right, Congressman. Well, thank you so much. We'll talk to you again soon. Thank
[28:43.400 --> 28:44.400]  you so much.
[28:44.400 --> 28:45.400]  Thank you.
[28:45.400 --> 28:49.400]  All right, there goes. Thank you. There goes Congressman RonPaul, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:49.400 --> 28:55.520]  Very, very exciting information and great to have him on the broadcast with us today.

[30:16.120 --> 30:21.160]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually
[30:21.160 --> 30:25.480]  right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[30:25.480 --> 30:30.560]  biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire
[30:30.560 --> 30:34.840]  prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his
[30:34.840 --> 30:39.200]  biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress
[30:39.200 --> 30:43.360]  this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything
[30:43.360 --> 30:47.240]  you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find

[32:08.840 --> 32:13.840]  off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've
[32:13.840 --> 32:18.880]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[32:18.880 --> 32:25.160]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full,
[32:25.160 --> 32:30.440]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held
[32:30.440 --> 32:35.640]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[32:35.640 --> 32:39.720]  Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[32:39.720 --> 32:44.680]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[32:44.680 --> 32:51.560]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[33:01.400 --> 33:20.520]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:20.520 --> 33:37.720]  Some good things are happening. Even the Washington Post had to run the headline today. Obama's
[33:37.720 --> 33:42.960]  negation of hostilities in Libya draws criticism. A White House has officially declared that
[33:42.960 --> 33:48.480]  what's happening in Libya is not hostilities. That's like if I say I'm God and I walk up
[33:48.480 --> 33:52.280]  and shoot you five times in the head and say, Bob isn't dead on the ground with his head
[33:52.280 --> 33:56.240]  blown off. Meanwhile, you're on the ground. The whole top of your head's blown off. You're
[33:56.240 --> 34:02.000]  dead. There's a big pool of blood. And I say, he's not dead. This isn't war. It's kinetic.
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.120]  And it turns out top military advisors, the top Pentagon lawyers, and by the way, they're
[34:09.120 --> 34:13.440]  now reporting throughout the week, even the New York Times says, the president's never
[34:13.440 --> 34:17.840]  gone against these lawyers. The lawyers have said it's illegal. You've got to get congressional
[34:17.840 --> 34:22.280]  approval. It's a war. You're making a fool out of yourself saying it's not a war. Mr.
[34:22.280 --> 34:27.760]  Peace Prize winner. And they said, eh, let them eat cake. And so that's now happening.
[34:27.760 --> 34:31.280]  But the good news is just a month ago, the Washington Post and others were agreeing it
[34:31.280 --> 34:37.180]  wasn't a war. They tried to sell us this manure and tell us that it was chocolate brownies.
[34:37.180 --> 34:40.800]  People didn't even take a bite. They smelled it and said, we know what that is. So the point
[34:40.800 --> 34:46.520]  is they're losing even more credibility because their lies have gotten more brazen. The point
[34:46.520 --> 34:52.080]  is, it's on. The Chinese are accelerating their dumping of T bills, FT headline, financial
[34:52.080 --> 34:58.120]  times, trades revealed, China shifts from dollar. Joining us via video Skype is Gerald
[34:58.120 --> 35:02.440]  Solente. Always great to have him. You should subscribe to his great journal and valuable
[35:02.440 --> 35:08.000]  info at trendsresearch.com. That's trendsresearch.com. Gerald, thanks for coming on a short notice.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.360]  Oh, it's my pleasure. You know that, Alex. It was great having dinner with you in New
[35:11.360 --> 35:16.480]  York. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, I'd been up for two days, covering
[35:16.480 --> 35:20.600]  Bilderberg, because my guys were up, you know, at three o'clock in the morning, my time,
[35:20.600 --> 35:24.560]  and hadn't had any sleep. So I'm sorry. I was like a zombie. No, no, it was a great
[35:24.560 --> 35:29.880]  night. It was fun to get together with everyone. It was awesome. Now that we've dispensed with
[35:29.880 --> 35:36.480]  the more enjoyable pleasantries, you've really called it accurately, so tell us what's going
[35:36.480 --> 35:41.960]  to unravel with this great world war that they're calling peace. Well, we're going to
[35:41.960 --> 35:47.920]  look what we have to look at now is what's going on in Europe, particularly with Greece
[35:47.920 --> 35:52.800]  and Spain. The people are taking to the streets. They know the deal that there's not there's
[35:52.800 --> 35:58.360]  no change at the ballot box. If you go to the ballot boxes, a jack in the box in there,
[35:58.360 --> 36:04.560]  just another political clown. So they're demanding real change they can believe in. So there's
[36:04.560 --> 36:10.760]  no outs in this. For example, you pick up the news and you see one day Greece is going
[36:10.760 --> 36:16.840]  to be bailed out. The next day they're not. Greece is only a small player with this. And
[36:16.840 --> 36:21.440]  what is the bailout? The bailout means you have a second mortgage. Now they're going
[36:21.440 --> 36:28.360]  to give you a third mortgage and the IMF is coming in to oversee the deal. All the IMF
[36:28.360 --> 36:37.000]  is, it's the International Mafia Federation. They're the loan sharks of last resort. You
[36:37.000 --> 36:42.080]  need the money. You go to the loan shark, but you know, they're respectable. You know,
[36:42.080 --> 36:47.680]  they have three names in their name like Dominique Strauss Khan, you know, and they loan you
[36:47.680 --> 36:54.200]  the money that they got from you in the bailout. That's a beautiful system. Oh, it is. And
[36:54.200 --> 37:00.600]  here's the deal where they tell you go tax the people. I want the money. You tax the
[37:00.600 --> 37:05.600]  people. You don't bring in enough money. Then they come up with another line. They say we
[37:05.600 --> 37:15.280]  have to privatize. Privatize. I want your bridge. I want your water supply. I want your
[37:15.280 --> 37:23.240]  toll road. Gabis. That's all it is. It's a mafia. They're shaking down these countries.
[37:23.240 --> 37:28.960]  And by the way, people should understand that's what happened in Egypt that set it up for
[37:28.960 --> 37:36.440]  what happened now. They sold the country out under quote privatization, which means taking
[37:36.440 --> 37:43.520]  valuable public resources and selling them to your criminal buddies for pennies on the
[37:43.520 --> 37:51.800]  dollar. So now it's imploding worldwide. As I said a year ago, follow the timeline, the
[37:51.800 --> 38:00.480]  crash of 29, the Great Depression, currency wars, trade wars, real wars, the panic of
[38:00.480 --> 38:10.200]  08, the Great Recessions, last depression, currency wars, trade wars, real wars. We heard
[38:10.200 --> 38:18.600]  public enemy number one today, Osama bin Bernanke say he's considering more stimulus.
[38:18.600 --> 38:26.920]  Of course. Great. Devalue the dollar more. Drive the people deeper into the ground. Make
[38:26.920 --> 38:33.480]  them pay more for everything because the banks need the money. They have to keep the Ponzi
[38:33.480 --> 38:40.960]  scheme going. That's what stimulus is. Keeping the Ponzi scheme going, but it's all collapsing.
[38:40.960 --> 38:46.760]  And as I said, when it all collapse, they take you to war. Did you see the quote I re-read
[38:46.760 --> 38:53.320]  it yesterday a few months ago with the Liberty dollar that been operating for 13 years, corning
[38:53.320 --> 38:57.240]  their own silver and gold, even AP admitted that's totally legal. There's hundreds of
[38:57.240 --> 39:02.720]  companies that do it. But because he criticized the Federal Reserve, they arrested him, had
[39:02.720 --> 39:10.360]  the federal jury who convict people 98% of the time, that shows how fake they are, convict
[39:10.360 --> 39:17.320]  him. And then the U.S. Attorney on the FBI website said, these people are terrorists.
[39:17.320 --> 39:21.320]  We're going to get anybody that's got gold and silver, anybody that tries to undermine
[39:21.320 --> 39:27.280]  our financial system. Here they are. The foreign banks have done this. The Goldman Sachs have
[39:27.280 --> 39:33.240]  done this. They're wrecking us. And then they're now blaming a company with gold and silver
[39:33.240 --> 39:38.680]  coins that never pretended to be government gold and silver, publicly criticizing it,
[39:38.680 --> 39:42.400]  saying have alternative currencies. We got a whole bunch of states moving to do the same
[39:42.400 --> 39:47.600]  thing. And they're saying your terrorists were coming after you. And now the forex came
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.720]  out and said that the way they interpret the new laws, that by July 15th, private sale
[39:52.720 --> 39:57.080]  of gold and silver will be illegal. And the word is now the feds are talking about trying
[39:57.080 --> 40:02.200]  to confiscate. I mean, these people, and I guess America will line up and say, because
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.720]  that's what happened in 1933. Okay, here's our gold and silver. Give us the valued paper
[40:07.720 --> 40:11.840]  back and we'll line up and the cops will have machine guns and we'll just give it to them
[40:11.840 --> 40:16.520]  and and then they'll publicly ship it to Goldman Sachs and Bank of America like they
[40:16.520 --> 40:23.080]  did in 1933. I mean, I mean, there's I can't believe the stuff they're doing, Gerald.
[40:23.080 --> 40:29.880]  Well, again, it was all predicted all foreseeable. It's the biggest bank robbery in world history
[40:29.880 --> 40:35.320]  and the banks are doing the robbing. And the only way this is going to change is to bring
[40:35.320 --> 40:43.960]  down the banks. And by the way, IMF is actually a verb like I am f or I am f'd up by doing
[40:43.960 --> 40:52.160]  business with them. That's all it is. It's one big international mafia federation. They
[40:52.160 --> 40:59.240]  are robbing us in broad daylight, and the people are taking it. And that's what really
[40:59.240 --> 41:06.440]  discourages me the most because they're still looking for a political solution. There's
[41:06.440 --> 41:13.000]  no such thing. It's an oxymoron. There's no political solutions.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.920]  Very well said, Gerald. And but but there are some good signs. I mean, Obama says these
[41:17.920 --> 41:22.880]  aren't wars. The mainstream media tries to play along with the emperor is wearing a beautiful
[41:22.880 --> 41:27.960]  outfit and enough of us stood up like the little kids said, Hey, the emperor's naked.
[41:27.960 --> 41:33.840]  And now all of the media, they're going, Yeah, Obama's a cook. Yeah, it is a war. He's super
[41:33.840 --> 41:39.120]  unpopular. Lewis Farrakhan acted like he was the second coming. Now Farrakhan has called
[41:39.120 --> 41:45.240]  Obama a murderer. I mean, I mean, Obama's stock is going down really, really, I mean,
[41:45.240 --> 41:50.360]  as fast as horse and buggy whip stock went down when Henry Ford opened up his assembly
[41:50.360 --> 41:57.440]  line. Yes, but it's it's only temporary. It changes on a dime. Look at the whimper crats.
[41:57.440 --> 42:04.400]  Those those those wiener liberals that are in condemning Obama for what he's doing regarding
[42:04.400 --> 42:10.120]  the War Powers Act. Could you imagine if Bush tried to pull this off? They'd be screaming
[42:10.120 --> 42:16.880]  bloody murder. Look at the way the country rallied around Obama with the Osama versus
[42:16.880 --> 42:23.520]  Obama story. You know, you remember the one, you know, we got all Osama and now he's wearing
[42:23.520 --> 42:28.760]  cement shoes and swimming with the fishes. You saw how the people bought that. That was
[42:28.760 --> 42:35.000]  almost as good. Obama could come out and say that July 25th on a large L from the North
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.880]  Pole will come down your chimney. And I believe 35% of the public would actually be waiting
[42:39.880 --> 43:04.480]  at their chimneys. Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the

[44:00.120 --> 44:04.800]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[44:04.800 --> 44:09.120]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[44:09.120 --> 44:13.440]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[44:13.440 --> 44:18.480]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[44:18.480 --> 44:23.160]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[44:23.160 --> 44:28.800]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[44:28.800 --> 44:33.120]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.760]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[44:37.760 --> 44:41.960]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[44:41.960 --> 44:46.040]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can
[44:46.040 --> 44:52.800]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government

[45:00.440 --> 45:07.360]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[45:07.360 --> 45:12.280]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[45:12.280 --> 45:21.280]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They're so
[45:21.280 --> 45:30.640]  bright in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset
[45:30.640 --> 45:39.040]  in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.

[46:03.840 --> 46:08.720]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[46:08.720 --> 46:13.880]  It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally
[46:13.880 --> 46:18.800]  as one of the most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the
[46:18.800 --> 46:24.560]  existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide. This documentary
[46:24.560 --> 46:29.920]  exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[46:29.920 --> 46:34.760]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic is formed. Prepare to
[46:34.760 --> 46:41.480]  enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship. Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[46:41.480 --> 46:45.920]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the Newell
[46:45.920 --> 46:52.400]  Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today

[47:01.400 --> 47:15.200]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:15.200 --> 47:23.880]  Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[47:23.880 --> 47:38.480]  Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[47:38.480 --> 47:44.480]  This is going to be an incredibly important broadcast. I am begging you. Out there to
[47:44.480 --> 47:50.440]  think for yourselves, to check the information I'm going to give you and to really, really
[47:50.440 --> 47:56.600]  open up your mind and hear what I am about to say. Everything is accelerating more and
[47:56.600 --> 48:05.680]  more on every front, economic, spiritual, military, health-wise. Everything is coming
[48:05.680 --> 48:12.520]  to a head and then that head will explode and then it will lead to a greater cascade.
[48:12.520 --> 48:19.600]  The world is going into an amazing time of flux. Corruption and those that are attracted
[48:19.600 --> 48:26.920]  to its dark light is expanding virally. Goodness, at the same time throughout history, only
[48:26.920 --> 48:33.320]  is roused and awakened when things get bad. And the corrupt forces, the social engineers
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.600]  have written countless white papers on how they've set up the final tyranny, the final
[48:37.600 --> 48:42.800]  revolution. They've studied how goodness, how wholesomeness, how those of us that love
[48:42.800 --> 48:49.840]  light and beauty and all that is good builds and then explodes against evil. Always when
[48:49.840 --> 48:58.560]  evil comes in, it's archetypes and it's a point of total takeover is when good rises.
[48:58.560 --> 49:03.600]  And the system has studied this and it is cold-bloodily trying to sell death, destruction,
[49:03.600 --> 49:09.160]  ugliness, all the vampire movies, all the Lady Gaga, all the rappers now about serial
[49:09.160 --> 49:14.960]  killing and kidnapping and murdering women and children and women killing their husbands.
[49:14.960 --> 49:21.600]  We're being sold a nihilistic view so we don't tune into our survival instinct that directs
[49:21.600 --> 49:28.360]  us so that we will basically allow ourselves to think it's sexy to lose, sexy to fail,
[49:28.360 --> 49:33.740]  to think it's cool to give in to weakness. And this can only be sold during a time of
[49:33.740 --> 49:39.240]  incredible decadence. People who are spoiled, rotten from birth, have no connection to
[49:39.240 --> 49:46.160]  reality, are involved in arrested development, they basically are taught that evil and darkness
[49:46.160 --> 49:53.560]  and corruption is powerful and cool and that somehow it's fun to spiritually align yourself
[49:53.560 --> 49:59.520]  with it. That is the great crossroads we're at and that's why they're pumping pure death,
[49:59.520 --> 50:05.760]  pure destruction into us as a type of psychological warfare mechanism. And I'll talk more about
[50:05.760 --> 50:10.240]  that in the third hour today. Joining us in T-minus 22 minutes, Webster Griffin Tarpley
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.240]  from Tripoli. He would have been on Friday, he would have been on Sunday. The phones have
[50:14.240 --> 50:20.720]  been out under intense NATO bombing. Historian and economist Webster Tarpley in Tripoli under
[50:20.720 --> 50:25.720]  bombardment, if he's able to join us, coming up in T-minus 21 minutes. We weren't supposed
[50:25.720 --> 50:30.920]  to talk about it until he did this first interview, but he's now there in place and we're going
[50:30.920 --> 50:35.360]  to have him on today coming up. Wayne Mattson has also been to Tripoli, investigative journalist
[50:35.360 --> 50:38.760]  former of the National Security Agency. He'll be joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[50:38.760 --> 50:44.720]  It'll be open phones and news and key break downs of other intelligence after that coming
[50:44.720 --> 50:51.600]  up in the third hour today. Now, all of that said, let me just read you the stacks here,
[50:51.600 --> 50:59.840]  okay? Just the first article in each stack. U.S. plans stealth survey on access to doctors
[50:59.840 --> 51:06.880]  ahead of nationalizing doctors, forcing you to serve in the national health care service.
[51:06.880 --> 51:12.200]  New York Times, Daily Mail. Now Obama's sending out snoopers to pose as patients so they can
[51:12.200 --> 51:18.360]  check up on doctors. This is every industry. The preachers, the police, anybody quoting
[51:18.360 --> 51:23.800]  infrastructure protection, they're giving security clearances to the TSA, they're giving
[51:23.800 --> 51:28.880]  it to bridge repair people, and they got little petty power trips at their secret police,
[51:28.880 --> 51:36.160]  and it's a total takeover. We're going to be going over that. Obviously, Greece's deputy
[51:36.160 --> 51:42.040]  prime minister warns of tanks in the streets, mass suicides, if second bailout vote down
[51:42.040 --> 51:46.960]  by a Greek parliament. Remember what we were told in 2008 and October? Give the banks tens
[51:46.960 --> 51:52.040]  of trillions. It's an open window of $870 billion that they got over and over again.
[51:52.040 --> 51:56.160]  Over $27 trillion. Last time we got the numbers, most of it to offshore private families and
[51:56.160 --> 52:02.600]  banks. Appolson told the closed sessions of House and Senate, you do what we say or there'll
[52:02.600 --> 52:06.520]  be martial law in blood in the streets. Same things being said. This will be the second
[52:06.520 --> 52:10.840]  bailout for Greece, which is really a payment to the banks. If they go along with it, their
[52:10.840 --> 52:16.480]  future is totally doomed to third world them. Look what we've turned into, ladies and gentlemen,
[52:16.480 --> 52:20.720]  whether you're black or white or Native American, you all went through adversity and absolute
[52:20.720 --> 52:27.440]  endless war and hardcore, cone in the barbarian activity. Look at you now. What happened to
[52:27.440 --> 52:34.600]  us? Scientific dictatorship happened. Rekindle your instincts to be a wild, free human. Turn
[52:34.600 --> 52:39.760]  on your instincts. Turn on the life force, ladies and gentlemen. It's unstoppable, and
[52:39.760 --> 52:45.440]  you'll truly be alive. You can only see what I've seen. If you can only commit to history,
[52:45.440 --> 52:51.280]  you'd realize why you're so weak, why you feel so powerless, why you behave like jellyfish.
[52:51.280 --> 52:58.440]  It's because you don't have a fire in your soul. Only liberty. Only the spirit of 1776,
[52:58.440 --> 53:03.360]  the animating spirit of liberty that God can breathe into men and women will quench your
[53:03.360 --> 53:09.240]  thirst. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Let me continue. It's all coming down, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:09.240 --> 53:14.040]  Meanwhile, they're threatening the same thing here in the United States, saying we'll lose
[53:14.040 --> 53:24.400]  our debt rating if we don't give the bankers even more money. Threat of 100 billion hit
[53:24.400 --> 53:30.280]  if U.S. top rating loss, financial times of London, it's all happening right now. We're
[53:30.280 --> 53:36.120]  going to break this down. As the economic dictatorship, the banker occupation rolls
[53:36.120 --> 53:43.840]  on. We've got incredible nuclear reactor news in the United States. Turns out that the facility
[53:43.840 --> 53:50.080]  has been flooded. The power is off. They're on diesel generators at Fort Calhoun. Our
[53:50.080 --> 53:53.000]  listeners said this was happening weeks ago from people they knew in the plant. We were
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  flooded with calls, but I couldn't confirm it. I guess we're going to get on an airplane,
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.720]  but those facilities have got guys with guns guarding them. How am I going to find out?
[53:59.720 --> 54:03.940]  Again, under national security, they hide what's really going on here. Los Alamos is
[54:03.940 --> 54:08.960]  on fire. A very, very big concern. Wildfire near Los Alamos lab. It's already on the
[54:08.960 --> 54:13.720]  nuclear testing areas, so it's reigniting all that stuff and getting into the atmosphere.
[54:13.720 --> 54:22.680]  That's MSNBC. It is all coming up. But first, before I get into the incredible treachery,
[54:22.680 --> 54:28.040]  the off the charts betrayal, duplicity that I have never even seen from Bill Clinton or
[54:28.040 --> 54:34.400]  Al Gore, who were masters of duplicity and deception of slickness of sliminess. Rick
[54:34.400 --> 54:42.600]  Perry and the speaker of the Texas House and the leader of the Senate, Dewhurst, they make
[54:42.600 --> 54:51.960]  Clinton and Obama and Bush look like pikers, look like addled idiots. Okay, this, this,
[54:51.960 --> 54:58.720]  this information, I invented it this morning out of anger at 7 a.m. talking to Paul Watson
[54:58.720 --> 55:03.440]  and reading over the legislation. I'm going to break it all down for you. I'm inventing
[55:03.440 --> 55:09.200]  it here. Only you can breathe life into it. Only you can animate it. Will you animate
[55:09.200 --> 55:13.040]  it? Will you step forward into history? Before I do that, I want to play a clip from Bugs
[55:13.040 --> 55:17.600]  Life we played from time to time about why the feds are so upset, why they're twisting
[55:17.600 --> 55:21.840]  arms and why they've engaged in extremely dirty tricks to get this, because if Texas
[55:21.840 --> 55:27.000]  stands up and people, the feds can only have victory after victory. If they ever have a
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.320]  defeat at the state level, it's starting to happen all over the country in different
[55:30.320 --> 55:37.760]  ways, the idea that we can use the Constitution to overthrow their tyranny will get purchased.
[55:37.760 --> 55:45.800]  It will get a foothold and their time is over. So this is very exciting that we pushed them
[55:45.800 --> 55:51.520]  into a second session and that we're going to push them into a third. First pray that
[55:51.520 --> 55:56.400]  the regular session, second session, and then a second special session, a third session.
[55:56.400 --> 56:00.920]  It ends Wednesday. We need to get in there, tell the state reps, tell the senators, look,
[56:00.920 --> 56:05.880]  just don't show up for votes, talk to others, kill all the legislation and explain to them
[56:05.880 --> 56:10.680]  you're not going to get all your other garbage through until you do this. And I'm explaining
[56:10.680 --> 56:14.720]  Perry's duplicity in a moment and what's happened. They've killed the bill. This is
[56:14.720 --> 56:20.240]  they killed it on Friday. They've officially put nails in it today. Okay. Here's a Bugs
[56:20.240 --> 56:25.880]  Life as we go out to break. There was that ant that stood up to me. Yeah, but we can
[56:25.880 --> 56:36.840]  forget about him. Yeah, it was just one. You're right. It's just one. And yeah, boys, they're
[56:36.840 --> 56:48.280]  puny puny. Say, let's pretend this brain is a puny little ant. Did that hurt? Nope. How
[56:48.280 --> 56:55.280]  about this one? Are you kidding? How about this?
[56:55.280 --> 57:08.600]  Jumps a giant container of grade on them. Instead of one, it's hundreds. You let one ant stand
[57:08.600 --> 57:17.960]  up to us, then they all might stand up. Those puny little ants outnumber us 100 to one.
[57:17.960 --> 57:24.800]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life. It's not about food. It's
[57:24.800 --> 57:32.400]  about keeping those ants in line. That's why we're going back. Does anybody else want
[57:32.400 --> 57:55.800]  to stay? Hello, this is Steve Shank. What does freedom mean to you? EFoods Direct is

[58:51.160 --> 58:57.040]  U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America
[58:57.040 --> 59:01.960]  in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop,
[59:01.960 --> 59:05.560]  travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and
[59:05.560 --> 59:09.560]  your own family. Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The
[59:09.560 --> 59:14.840]  crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May,
[59:14.840 --> 59:19.320]  Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's
[59:19.320 --> 59:24.000]  called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.760]  for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[59:28.760 --> 59:32.920]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He
[59:32.920 --> 59:37.120]  explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[59:37.120 --> 59:44.400]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's End of America, the number three.com.
[59:44.400 --> 59:51.400]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[59:51.400 --> 01:00:19.400]  Well, it's very traitorous what's happened, and State Representative David Simpson told
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:26.400]  us about this this morning. They rewrote the bill in the House to say that basically, for
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.280]  any reason, they can grope you. So they took a bill saying we're going to enforce the
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.720]  law that police or anybody else can't stick their hands down your pants without a warrant,
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:39.880]  and they've said now basically, if government feels like it, they can. And they're now selling
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:45.760]  that. Now, remember, the House unanimously voted a month ago to enforce the law and say
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.080]  you can't touch on the outside of the inside of the pants or skirt or whatever it is. And
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.560]  now they've twisted that to say, yes, TSA, for any reason, can basically give you a
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:01.920]  proctology exam if they want to. So the 95-year-old ladies dying of cancer, get ready, a world
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.360]  of hurt's coming. This is all about federal power grab, federal occupation. It's all about
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:12.920]  checkpoints all across the country. Let's let the House know we're aware of their
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:25.680]  treatment! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED!
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:33.040]  TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! TREATED! These are criminals, the text you're
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:41.720]  propping and everything. These are scumbags, and breast off your bones. So they can lay
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.720]  They can lay down on their backs for the federal government to come in here and rope our little girls and boys.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.720]  Yeah, you like it.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.720]  What this is?
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.720]  What this is is a pedophile protection network.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:01.720]  Get the hell out of here!
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.720]  Get the hell out of here!
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.720]  Get the hell out of here!
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.720]  Get the hell out of here!
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.720]  They're not in session right now.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.720]  They're not in session right now.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.720]  They're doing it.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.720]  They think we don't know Perry killed the last bill that acclaimed he supports it.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.720]  No matter what your policy is, the point is,
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.720]  Rick Perry is a deceptive snake at the level of the devil.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.720]  This is our capital.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.720]  It doesn't belong to the offshore banks.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:39.720]  Yeah!
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.720]  The senators were visibly changed whenever they started chanting outdoors,
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.720]  and then you were still filming,
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.720]  and the attention kind of came back to the Senate floor.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.720]  When you moved just a few feet, he looked up,
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.720]  he was tracking your every move.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.720]  He was very aware of the people in there,
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.720]  very aware of the people that were out in the hall,
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.720]  and very, very aware of that camera.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.720]  I've been in here before taping.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.720]  I've been here with media taping.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.720]  Well, that's the rules today. You can't have it.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.720]  All rules today.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720]  Well, go get the police then.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.720]  Yeah, get the police.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.720]  So again, this is America now.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.720]  The police isn't here not doing anything,
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.720]  and he comes and he says the rules today
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.720]  are that you can't videotape.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.720]  The rules today.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.720]  Now, usually the police get caught in here,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.720]  and we've caught it before where the police are,
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.720]  we're shooting live videos as well,
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.720]  where the police, you know, do their job
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.720]  and leave everybody alone.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.720]  And we hope that's the case, but Rob's been here before
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.720]  when they're all voting for each other.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:01.720]  That's Kurt Watson.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.720]  First, we're going to read that to you.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.720]  That's what's going to be.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.720]  Two, three.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.720]  Freedom!
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.720]  Freedom!
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.720]  Freedom!
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.720]  Freedom!
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.720]  Freedom!
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.720]  Freedom!
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:30.720]  Freedom!
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.720]  Freedom!
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.720]  But here's the issue.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.720]  National TV, The Drugs Report,
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.720]  Infowars.com, the whole world's watching.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720]  And what we learned from Texas
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.720]  will be used in other states
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:53.720]  to beat you globalists, Asians, and mercenaries.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:59.720]  Yeah!
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.720]  Jones, with five good reasons
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.720]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.720]  Number one, new climate legislation
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.720]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.720]  Number two, our new energies are
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.720]  wants to control how much power
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.720]  your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.720]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.720]  and the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.720]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.720]  And now, new socialist legislation
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.720]  is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.720]  Number four, dangerous weather
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.720]  is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.720]  Every year, thousands of families
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.720]  lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.720]  Number five, a solar power generator
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.720]  provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.720]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.720]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.720]  one of my old sponsors.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.720]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.720]  So go to mysolarbackup.com
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.720]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:06:07.720]  Music playing.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.720]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.720]  of the New World Order,
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.720]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.720]  Webster Griffin Tartley, you are now joining us.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.720]  Very brave to be there,
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.720]  now nearing your second week in Libya
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.720]  or about to end the first week.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.720]  Webster, welcome.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.720]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.720]  These are gigantic crowds.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.720]  It looks like, as a curse review,
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.720]  200,000 or more. How many people is that?
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.720]  I think that's probably about right.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.720]  It's in the hundreds of thousands,
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.720]  and the thing is I'm here above Green Square.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:50.720]  This is a vantage point at the edge of the old city of Tripoli,
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.720]  which goes back to the Roman Empire.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.720]  So I'm up here with the press call.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.720]  We came on the press bus today,
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.720]  and there are easily tens of thousands
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.720]  right in this packed area right below us,
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:08.720]  where they're really having quite a time.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.720]  They're chanting and dancing,
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:14.720]  and they're shooting off Kalashnikov's colleagues every now
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.720]  and then you hear a ripple of machine gun fire.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.720]  There's such slaves that they have 200,000
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.720]  or looks like more people firing automatic weapons in the air.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.720]  Can you imagine land of the free, home of the brave,
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.720]  what the government would do if 200,000 people
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.720]  tried to gather with Kalashnikov's in the capital?
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.720]  What would happen?
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.720]  I don't know, but here it's also women.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.720]  The demand for Kalashnikov among women here is monumental,
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.720]  but let me just give you an idea of the setting.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:47.720]  We're about two hours from the Mediterranean sunset,
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.720]  and the reason they have these demonstrations late in the day
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.720]  is what I'm feeling right now.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.720]  The sun is still very strong, right?
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.720]  We're basically on the northern edge of the Sahara Desert.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.720]  The Mediterranean is about half a mile away,
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.720]  so we're right in by this basin in the Port of Tripoli,
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.720]  right across from me is a building that goes back ultimately
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.720]  to about the 5th century AD.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.720]  It's Marcus Decimus Aurelius,
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.720]  one of the later Roman emperors built this palace,
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.720]  and he built the walls to the old city,
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.720]  and then beyond that you could see the minarets
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.720]  of the interior of the old city.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.720]  Those came later, of course.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.720]  Those came in the 700s and the 800s,
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.720]  and the blast is back then.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.720]  It's green. It's a sea of green.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.720]  They have got these green stripes, right?
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.720]  About six feet wide,
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.720]  and every tribe is competing with every other tribe
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.720]  to see who can have the longest one,
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.720]  and some of them are in their four kilometers long,
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.720]  and the other one says that's nothing.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.720]  We've got 10 kilometers over here,
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.720]  so that's going on.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.720]  We've got above me there are these floodlights, right?
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.720]  Like at a ballpark,
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.720]  and there are people climbing up on these things
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.720]  with great danger to life and limb.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.720]  Can you imagine if U.S. troops go into that city?
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.720]  I think that would be rivers of blood,
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.720]  and once again, these were people
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.720]  who put up with a million dead
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.720]  under the Italian colonialism.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.720]  They're the first people in the world
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.720]  to have poison gas used on them.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.720]  That didn't stop them,
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.720]  and ultimately the Italians built
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.720]  what a match to the primitive version
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.720]  of the Berlin Wall,
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.720]  or the inner German border
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.720]  in the Cold War,
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.720]  except this was all along the border
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.720]  between Libya and Egypt
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.720]  to keep the British from smuggling in
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.720]  support for the rebels.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.720]  So there's chanting.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.720]  Now, the chanting is actually
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.720]  a very good, humored crowd.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.720]  You see some pro-Syrian flags.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.720]  There's solidarity with Syria operations.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.720]  There are some other flags down there,
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.720]  and the big guy that they hate is Sarkozy.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.720]  Man, down, down, Sarkozy, down, down, Sarkozy.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.720]  That's the order of the day,
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.720]  and there was already sort of a spontaneous
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.720]  jubilation yesterday
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.720]  when Sarkozy got himself yanked by this guy
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.720]  when he was working a rope line.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.720]  Some guy grabbed him by the jacket
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.720]  and just about threw him down,
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.720]  and probably that guy, whoever he is,
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.720]  says that that had to do with Libya.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.720]  Well, we know what that stuff is worth,
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.720]  but still, here, it's welcome,
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.720]  because out of all of these figures,
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.720]  Sarkozy is undoubtedly the most hated.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.720]  So he is the number one villain.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.720]  Do we know why Sarkozy, who admittedly was financed
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.720]  with some Libyan money
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.720]  and making deals with Muammar Qaddafi,
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.720]  why Sarkozy is trying to double-cross Qaddafi?
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.720]  Well, because you've got to remember
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.720]  who Sarkozy is, right?
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.720]  There may be a son down there
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.720]  that says something about Sarkozy's ancestry.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.720]  He is the bastard son of the CIA
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.720]  in the sense that Sarkozy's mother,
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.720]  I guess his biological mother,
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.720]  remarried and the guy who became the stepfather
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.720]  to Sarkozy is Wiesner.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.720]  I think Frank Wiesner, Frank Wiesner,
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.720]  I don't know what number, or junior,
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.720]  but this is a celebrated family of the State Department
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.720]  and above all the CIA, so...
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.720]  Sure, Sarkozy's not even from France
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.720]  for folks that don't know that.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.720]  I think more Hungarian to begin with.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720]  Yes.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.720]  The big influence that the household that he grew with
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.720]  was the CIA household.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.720]  So now we've got a puppet president of France
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.720]  and it's just amazing the woman that was put in
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.720]  as the new head of the IMF, right, this black guard,
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.720]  I've heard some stories about Lagarde now
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.720]  from some French people who were here,
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.720]  Thierry Maison, among others,
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.720]  and the idea is Lagarde, as a French minister,
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.720]  treasury secretary,
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:09.720]  she put out an order that it was forbidden
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.720]  to speak French in that ministry.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.720]  She said everything has to be done in English,
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.720]  everything has to be written in English,
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.720]  don't come to me and talk to me in French,
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.720]  I want to hear it in English.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.720]  All right, yes, so that's putting it mildly.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.720]  She's off the deep end on that stuff.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:29.720]  There's a crescendo of oratory and cheering
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.720]  in the background that you may hear,
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.720]  and I see another guy up on this...
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.720]  No, no, you're reporting.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.720]  We've got the video up for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.720]  Okay, wonderful.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.720]  Live, but let me stop you
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:43.720]  because I want to cover two points with you here
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.720]  because I know you're not getting a lot of news
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.720]  while you're over there under the bombardment.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.720]  This is an envoy NATO preparing Libyan ground invasion
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.720]  in FullWars.com.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.720]  This is art of RIA, you know, the main TV in Russia.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:03.720]  Dmitry Rogozin told RIA Novostat on Friday
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.720]  that NATO is probably preparing a ground invasion
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.720]  to overthrow the Gaddafi regime in Libya.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.720]  He is Russia's NATO envoy.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.720]  I think that now we are witnessing
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.720]  a preparation stage for a ground invasion,
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.720]  which NATO, and at least some of its members,
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.720]  are going to begin, and then we go into the Guardian
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.720]  and our past reports, we broke this, of course,
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.720]  three weeks ago from our intel sources.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.720]  First Cav under three corps out of Fort Hood and others.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.720]  Just that contingent, at least 15,000 with another 15,000
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.720]  support troops, 30,000 there.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.720]  The Marine Corps commander out of One Base
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.720]  two months ago said, yes, we're leaving to go to Libya.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.720]  I'm on the radio.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.720]  So, Tarpley, what do you make of the fact that Russia
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.720]  is now saying that they've got intel,
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.720]  the green light is rolling forward?
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.720]  I mean, this is madness.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.720]  I think it's widely known.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.720]  I was just on Russia today via Moscow a couple of hours ago,
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.720]  and that should be up at the top,
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.720]  so it's too long, I hope.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.720]  And the main idea was that Lavrov also,
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.720]  the foreign minister, had said something similar.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.720]  So we got all the main Russian representatives
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.720]  in the world, really, putting out that line.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.720]  So they obviously see something coming,
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.720]  and that puts the ball in our court.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.720]  I saw today some analyses of that vote
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.720]  in the House of Representatives from last week,
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.720]  which indicates that there are already enough votes
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.720]  in the House to cut off the money and stop the war,
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.720]  at least from the House of Representatives point of view.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.720]  So, I think the commentary from Lavrov,
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.720]  from Lavrov, that I've got the...
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.720]  Sorry, I just got interrupted here.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.720]  I think I may be the only person doing a live feed.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.720]  I understand, Lord Tarpley, please continue.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:02.720]  The thing is, it's coming, right?
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.720]  So the House of Representatives,
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.720]  you know, they've got enough votes.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.720]  The only thing you need is a clean bill
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.720]  that says no more funding, no more killing,
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.720]  no more war, and nothing is approved,
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.720]  and not even retrospectively.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.720]  Because when you look at that,
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.720]  the bill put in by Congressman Rooney last week,
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.720]  which was presented as the one cutting off the fund,
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.720]  which was lost by about 30 votes,
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.720]  that could have had 70 more anti-war Democrats voting for it.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.720]  But it was a... some people said it was approving Obama
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.720]  through the back door, because it said,
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.720]  no killing, but everything else is fine,
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.720]  but all the logistics and everything else, you know,
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.720]  up to killing, but not including killing is fine,
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.720]  and what Obama has done is approved.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.720]  A lot of people just don't want to vote for that.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:54.720]  So, again...
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.720]  Well, we know the drama...
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.720]  I mean, Webster, we know the propaganda
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.720]  because they always baited, tested up front.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.720]  in the last century alone.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.720]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.720]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.720]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.720]  and they really are calling the shots.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.720]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.720]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.720]  the criminal off-short cartel,
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.720]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.720]  and on its ashes, constructing world government.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.720]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists,
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.720]  they're asking for more matches,
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.720]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:43.720]  Today seems like nobody does care,
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.720]  and right now in Washington, D.C.,
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.720]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.720]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.720]  We're watching online right now
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.720]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.720]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones,
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.720]  and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.720]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.720]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.720]  by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.720]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.720]  for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.720]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.720]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.720]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.720]  instantly into the bloodstream
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:34.720]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.720]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.720]  with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.720]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided,
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.720]  making production fast and simple.
