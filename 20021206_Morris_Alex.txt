[00:00.000 --> 00:21.840]  All right, coming up I will get into Bush and his attack on the second amendment that
[00:21.840 --> 00:26.780]  doesn't hold a candle to Bill Clinton's hatred of the second amendment, the open borders,
[00:26.780 --> 00:30.100]  the war with Iraq, how they say we're going to get attacked by smallpox, who will really
[00:30.100 --> 00:36.860]  be behind that, a host of news stories, and your calls today.
[00:36.860 --> 00:41.560]  We're about to bring up Ruth Morris, who was sterilized by the U.S. government.
[00:41.560 --> 00:48.300]  Here's a CNN story, also in the Associated Press, the Oragonian, the Register Guard,
[00:48.300 --> 00:50.380]  and many, many other news reports.
[00:50.380 --> 00:56.020]  Apologize for eugenics, Oregon's sterilization records shredded, now turns out it was well
[00:56.020 --> 01:03.420]  over 3,000 just in Oregon, upwards of 400,000 nationwide, went on until the 1980s.
[01:03.420 --> 01:08.780]  First they were saying late 70s, now we find out 1983, now the news reports are coming
[01:08.780 --> 01:11.540]  out saying maybe it's still going on.
[01:11.540 --> 01:13.900]  They just give it new names.
[01:13.900 --> 01:16.660]  Oregon governor apologizes for forced sterilizations.
[01:16.660 --> 01:23.100]  Governor John Kitzhaber, who by the way is a big eugenicist involved in bioethics, Governor
[01:23.100 --> 01:26.860]  John Kitzhaber formally apologized Monday for Oregon's passage of eugenics law that
[01:26.860 --> 01:28.740]  led to the forced sterilization of hundreds of people.
[01:28.740 --> 01:33.340]  By the way, this came out because of lawsuits and he got caught shredding the documents.
[01:33.340 --> 01:39.460]  Girls in Reform School, people in mental institutions and poor women selected by welfare workers,
[01:39.460 --> 01:44.920]  oh, just selected by a welfare worker, were among the more than 2,500, yeah, that's putting
[01:44.920 --> 01:45.920]  it lightly.
[01:45.920 --> 01:49.980]  It's not really a lie when they say more than 2,500, it might be 10,000, but we'll just
[01:49.980 --> 01:52.460]  say more than 2,500.
[01:52.460 --> 01:57.140]  Again subjected to sterilizations under a law that stood from 1917 to 1983.
[01:57.140 --> 02:02.220]  By the way, I don't like talking like this in front of Ruth, but I'm sure she's learned
[02:02.220 --> 02:05.900]  to live with it, but I watched the Frontline PBS special about five years ago that made
[02:05.900 --> 02:06.900]  me cry.
[02:06.900 --> 02:11.180]  I began crying one night watching it.
[02:11.180 --> 02:15.900]  Margaret Sanger giving awards to Hitler, getting awards from Hitler, they would take little
[02:15.900 --> 02:21.380]  girls who made under B pluses, they even showed the report cards from single parent homes,
[02:21.380 --> 02:27.060]  they would take them to a mental institution, they would have medical students perform live
[02:27.060 --> 02:32.460]  vivisections cutting them open, they did even more horrible things I won't mention here
[02:32.460 --> 02:33.460]  on the air.
[02:33.460 --> 02:38.140]  This is just to let you know who runs this government, who wants to force vaccinate you,
[02:38.140 --> 02:43.260]  who wants to turn our public schools into prisons, this is to let you understand what
[02:43.260 --> 02:48.180]  we're facing, ladies and gentlemen, and how this government's expanding its control and
[02:48.180 --> 02:53.980]  the mindset that runs it, that eugenics is still going on under the term bioethics.
[02:53.980 --> 02:58.580]  Ruth Morris joining us from Oregon, it's great to have you on the show and I really want
[02:58.580 --> 03:02.140]  to honor you for your courage and strength in standing up and fighting.
[03:02.140 --> 03:04.140]  Well thank you.
[03:04.140 --> 03:09.220]  Ruth, I was reading in the newspaper you're not satisfied with the whitewash that's going
[03:09.220 --> 03:10.220]  on by the governor.
[03:10.220 --> 03:11.220]  No.
[03:11.220 --> 03:17.620]  Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, your story, what happened to you, how you
[03:17.660 --> 03:20.020]  got in their clutches, and what happened.
[03:20.020 --> 03:25.980]  Okay, I, um, what was the first question?
[03:25.980 --> 03:32.260]  Tell us about yourself, tell us how you fell into the, into Jeffrey Dahmer's clutches,
[03:32.260 --> 03:35.980]  the government Ted Bundy's, how did this happen?
[03:35.980 --> 03:46.460]  Ah, okay, I am a single woman, and right now I'm living in a house with another guy.
[03:46.500 --> 03:53.180]  I should say that he was an identical twin, and I was, um, I don't know if you know what
[03:53.180 --> 04:02.180]  committed means, but I was committed to, um, his identical twin brother, that passed away,
[04:02.180 --> 04:05.220]  his identical brother passed away until I...
[04:05.220 --> 04:12.980]  Okay, ma'am, you were put in a mental institution, what happened to you, how did they, explain
[04:12.980 --> 04:14.780]  the medical procedure please.
[04:14.780 --> 04:22.500]  They didn't explain to me, my dad and I had a sign of paper that I did not understand
[04:22.500 --> 04:27.380]  until afterwards, after they did my sterilization.
[04:27.380 --> 04:32.860]  So using racketeering, the color of law got you to waive all your rights, and they did
[04:32.860 --> 04:33.860]  this to you?
[04:33.860 --> 04:34.860]  Yes.
[04:34.860 --> 04:39.540]  Now can you, go back to when this happened, what year?
[04:39.540 --> 04:44.820]  Um, it had to be in 1965.
[04:44.820 --> 04:45.820]  Okay.
[04:45.820 --> 04:49.020]  Because I was living in Fairview in 1965.
[04:49.020 --> 04:55.540]  Okay, so you were committed to the mental institution, what was it like, I mean, how
[04:55.540 --> 05:00.660]  long were you in the mental institution before they came, and what was the surgery like,
[05:00.660 --> 05:01.660]  what did they do to you?
[05:01.660 --> 05:06.300]  Who knows what they did to me, I was knocked out.
[05:06.300 --> 05:10.460]  Have you heard about how they did it to other young people who weren't awake, have you ever
[05:10.460 --> 05:11.460]  heard about that?
[05:11.460 --> 05:19.780]  No, I didn't, but I know that, and they took out my appendix while I was out, that I didn't
[05:19.780 --> 05:26.260]  know that they did it, until, until later on.
[05:26.260 --> 05:29.820]  So they took other organs other than your uterus?
[05:29.820 --> 05:32.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:32.580 --> 05:34.940]  Where did they conduct the surgery?
[05:34.980 --> 05:40.500]  There was a hospital right on the ground, at Fairview.
[05:43.500 --> 05:51.340]  Well, that's amazing, um, what did you do after you got out of the institution, what
[05:51.340 --> 05:55.980]  developed after that, when did you start speaking out with others against this?
[05:56.020 --> 06:05.540]  Um, I just started speaking out, um, I must have been in the, um, 82, 83.
[06:09.540 --> 06:13.700]  Now, that's when it finally came to light in Oregon, and this had been going on right
[06:13.700 --> 06:18.820]  up until 1983, according to the Associated Press, uh, what, did you hear others starting
[06:18.820 --> 06:21.180]  to speak out, so you decided to get involved, or?
[06:21.180 --> 06:22.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:22.580 --> 06:26.980]  What was the atmosphere like in 83, what was going on in Oregon, who was fighting this
[06:26.980 --> 06:27.980]  Nazi policy?
[06:27.980 --> 06:37.140]  Um, really, I'm not sure who was fighting, but, um, a lot of people that was in the institutions,
[06:37.140 --> 06:43.260]  they said they wanted to fight for this, and I, and I went along with them.
[06:43.260 --> 06:46.020]  Now, have you heard of bioethics?
[06:46.020 --> 06:48.940]  Uh, no.
[06:48.940 --> 06:54.420]  That's the new term, what the globalists do, our enemies, the dehumanizers, they will rename
[06:54.420 --> 06:57.540]  something, it's like School of Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia, where they trained
[06:57.540 --> 07:02.660]  torture for a lot of torture for 50 years, while under massive pressure, they just renamed
[07:02.660 --> 07:06.980]  it, and expanded torture training for people from hundreds of countries, including our
[07:06.980 --> 07:07.980]  soldiers.
[07:07.980 --> 07:13.220]  Uh, so, it's the same system over and over again, uh, have you read in the news how they
[07:13.220 --> 07:16.420]  would also sterilize children of single-parent homes?
[07:16.420 --> 07:17.420]  Yeah.
[07:17.420 --> 07:22.060]  CPS would grab the children and then take children as young as five to be sterilized?
[07:22.060 --> 07:23.060]  Yes, yes.
[07:23.060 --> 07:26.940]  Have you talked to other victims of this?
[07:26.940 --> 07:34.020]  And that's terrible, you know, and I don't think that they should.
[07:34.020 --> 07:38.340]  Have you talked to some of the other victims that were grabbed simply for not doing well
[07:38.340 --> 07:39.340]  on test scores?
[07:39.340 --> 07:44.540]  No, I have not.
[07:44.540 --> 07:49.020]  Have you ever seen the PBS documentary about, uh, how they would take little girls who made
[07:49.020 --> 07:51.180]  under a B-plus and sterilize them?
[07:51.180 --> 07:52.180]  Yes.
[07:52.180 --> 07:53.860]  Oh, you did see that show then?
[07:53.860 --> 07:54.860]  Uh-huh.
[07:54.860 --> 07:58.460]  My, that's quite a crime, I guess, to make under a B-plus.
[07:58.460 --> 07:59.460]  Yeah.
[07:59.460 --> 08:13.260]  And I think, really, I think to my, to me, that people are sick when they do this.
[08:13.260 --> 08:17.540]  You know, in the other states.
[08:17.540 --> 08:22.420]  You're saying the people, uh, the people that are into the eugenics are sick, and I would
[08:22.420 --> 08:23.420]  agree they are sick.
[08:23.420 --> 08:24.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:24.420 --> 08:25.420]  They're psychotic, Phil.
[08:25.420 --> 08:26.420]  Yes.
[08:26.420 --> 08:31.300]  Uh, are you aware that Margaret Sanger is hailed as a liberal, but she was, uh, actually traveled
[08:31.300 --> 08:35.780]  to Germany to be with Adolf Hitler, and, uh, he got many of his ideas from her?
[08:35.780 --> 08:38.540]  God, you've got to be kidding.
[08:38.540 --> 08:42.780]  Well, no, they've got their death mill set up in every city and planned baronhood, but,
[08:43.300 --> 08:49.860]  certainly, you're aware that eugenics got a bad name after Hitler expanded its policies,
[08:49.860 --> 08:53.700]  and that's when they kind of got quiet about it in the 50s, but, as you said, it was going
[08:53.700 --> 08:55.700]  on until the 1980s.
[08:55.700 --> 08:59.700]  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[08:59.700 --> 09:06.600]  Now, the governor has shredded the documents, so we don't know exactly how many.
[09:06.600 --> 09:08.900]  We know it's now, they're admitting, over 3,000.
[09:08.900 --> 09:09.900]  Uh-huh.
[09:10.020 --> 09:14.020]  Why do you think the government shredded all the eugenics records?
[09:14.020 --> 09:19.020]  I suppose so they wouldn't get into trouble.
[09:19.020 --> 09:21.020]  Now, you know your governor's a psychiatrist.
[09:21.020 --> 09:23.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:23.020 --> 09:27.020]  Did you hear him last year say that 70% of children need to be drugged at birth?
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.020]  Yes, I did.
[09:28.020 --> 09:30.020]  Oh, you did hear him?
[09:30.020 --> 09:32.620]  70% of us need to be drugged at birth.
[09:32.620 --> 09:33.620]  That was his press release.
[09:33.620 --> 09:34.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:34.620 --> 09:36.620]  How has that been received in Oregon?
[09:37.340 --> 09:41.340]  It's just up in the air right now.
[09:41.340 --> 09:45.340]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is out of the Oregonian, this is out of the Associated
[09:45.340 --> 09:46.340]  Press.
[09:46.340 --> 09:51.940]  Last year, a press release by the governor, John Kitzhaber, says that 70% of children
[09:51.940 --> 09:56.340]  need to be drugged, not just with psychotropics, but with anti-psychotics at birth.
[09:56.340 --> 09:59.340]  This is for a new world, soma.
[09:59.340 --> 10:02.340]  Can you see how they use drugs to control the population, Ruth Morris?
[10:02.340 --> 10:04.340]  Yes, I have.
[10:05.060 --> 10:08.060]  And I'm not very good.
[10:12.060 --> 10:16.560]  Well, certainly it's heartening, Ruth, to know that by speaking up, we've been able
[10:16.560 --> 10:20.060]  to at least end the forced sterilization practice.
[10:20.060 --> 10:21.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:21.060 --> 10:27.060]  Is that heartening to think that we can now affect and expose other evils and end those?
[10:27.060 --> 10:29.060]  Yeah, we could.
[10:29.780 --> 10:35.780]  What would you say if I told you they're adding a hormone or hormone combinations to injections
[10:35.780 --> 10:37.780]  to sterilize people today?
[10:37.780 --> 10:44.780]  And that's why the birth rate is dropping in people that take the vaccinations.
[10:44.780 --> 10:47.780]  Were you aware of the UN's plan for sterilization worldwide?
[10:47.780 --> 10:48.780]  No.
[10:51.780 --> 10:54.780]  You think it's wrong to rob somebody of the reproductive future?
[10:54.780 --> 10:56.780]  Yeah, I do.
[10:57.500 --> 11:01.500]  Have you received any compensation for what they did to you, Ruth?
[11:01.500 --> 11:08.500]  Well, right now, in this day and age, I would like to have children, but I can't.
[11:08.500 --> 11:12.500]  Well, I just saw in the article that you were wanting some type of compensation.
[11:12.500 --> 11:18.500]  Have you been given any financial compensation for the brutal Jeffrey Dahmer attack you suffered?
[11:18.500 --> 11:21.500]  No, I have not.
[11:21.500 --> 11:24.500]  What about the Ted Bundy Jeffrey Dahmer doctor that did this?
[11:24.500 --> 11:26.500]  Is he still alive?
[11:27.220 --> 11:29.220]  I don't know if he is or not.
[11:29.220 --> 11:32.220]  Well, I'm serious, and let's stop calling them nice people.
[11:32.220 --> 11:33.220]  These are Ted Bundys.
[11:33.220 --> 11:35.220]  Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[11:35.220 --> 11:36.220]  They need to be executed.
[11:36.220 --> 11:37.220]  Yeah.
[11:37.220 --> 11:38.220]  Ruth, stay right there.
[11:38.220 --> 11:39.220]  Okay.
[11:39.220 --> 11:42.220]  By the way, folks, we all agree Nazis should have been executed.
[11:42.220 --> 11:43.220]  Well, they did this.
[11:43.220 --> 11:44.220]  Our government did this.
[11:44.220 --> 11:46.220]  We need to execute them.
[11:46.220 --> 11:47.220]  Stay right there, Ruth.
[11:47.220 --> 11:52.220]  You see, let's talk like human beings, because they didn't just grab folks who had been committed
[11:52.220 --> 11:54.220]  to mental institutions like Ruth, and that's bad enough.
[11:54.940 --> 11:56.940]  They grabbed little girls who made Underbee pluses.
[11:56.940 --> 11:59.940]  They had to have their heads beaten with baseball bats.
[11:59.940 --> 12:06.940]  Through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[12:08.940 --> 12:13.940]  You know, I find it hard to believe that the governor of Oregon said that 70% of children
[12:13.940 --> 12:16.940]  are mentally ill at birth and need to be forced drugged.
[12:16.940 --> 12:22.940]  Nationwide, if your child is in Head Start, they send two CPS visits a year to your home,
[12:23.660 --> 12:28.260]  fully, one-third of the children are being seized from the families that unknowingly
[12:28.260 --> 12:35.260]  put their children in Head Start, SCNN, AP, Oregonian report.
[12:35.260 --> 12:37.420]  Just in Oregon alone, this is how they would do it.
[12:37.420 --> 12:41.980]  They would send CPS to poor families' homes, generally seize the children and have forced
[12:41.980 --> 12:42.980]  sterilization.
[12:42.980 --> 12:47.740]  We're talking to Ruth Morris, who was committed to a mental institution back in 65 and then
[12:47.740 --> 12:52.740]  summarily had multiple organs removed from her body.
[12:52.740 --> 12:53.740]  We appreciate her courage.
[12:53.740 --> 12:56.740]  Oncoming on the show today, we're about to go to some of your calls.
[12:56.740 --> 12:58.740]  We'd like to talk to Ruth Morris.
[12:58.740 --> 13:01.740]  If you have any questions or comments, we'd love to hear from you.
[13:07.740 --> 13:09.740]  Ruth, you're still there, right?
[13:09.740 --> 13:10.740]  I am.
[13:10.740 --> 13:14.740]  What would you like to see happen to the people that did this to you?
[13:14.740 --> 13:18.740]  Hang them from the nearest tree.
[13:18.740 --> 13:21.740]  Well, that's a sane answer.
[13:21.740 --> 13:26.740]  Now, that's what we should all be calling for.
[13:26.740 --> 13:28.740]  Have there ever been any criminal charges?
[13:28.740 --> 13:33.740]  I guess they shredded all the documents so they can deny it in court, I guess.
[13:33.740 --> 13:35.740]  How do we stop them?
[13:35.740 --> 13:37.740]  What procedures are being followed there?
[13:37.740 --> 13:39.740]  What's happening in Oregon?
[13:39.740 --> 13:46.740]  Just what Governor Kisthofer did Monday.
[13:46.740 --> 13:49.740]  He apologized and that's it.
[13:49.740 --> 13:52.740]  Now, it came out four months ago that he shredded the documents.
[13:52.740 --> 13:53.740]  Yeah.
[13:53.740 --> 13:56.740]  So, he got caught and now he's apologizing.
[13:56.740 --> 13:57.740]  Hmm.
[13:57.740 --> 13:58.740]  Yeah.
[13:58.740 --> 14:03.740]  That's like, you know, the cops catch the serial killer burying the bodies in the backyard
[14:03.740 --> 14:07.740]  and the serial killer says, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[14:07.740 --> 14:10.740]  And then they find him and laugh at the bodies, I mean.
[14:10.740 --> 14:13.740]  Well, it's okay because they said they were sorry.
[14:13.740 --> 14:15.740]  Yeah, but I don't think so.
[14:15.740 --> 14:18.740]  Well, he makes himself a party to all this by trying to cover it up.
[14:18.740 --> 14:21.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[14:21.740 --> 14:25.740]  Well, that's really sick that he apologizes after he gets caught shredding.
[14:25.740 --> 14:28.740]  Yeah, that's true.
[14:28.740 --> 14:31.740]  I think he felt kind of guilty after that.
[14:31.740 --> 14:33.740]  Very guilty.
[14:33.740 --> 14:36.740]  Well, he's just trying to throw people off.
[14:36.740 --> 14:37.740]  Yeah.
[14:37.740 --> 14:40.740]  He's even, this guy's a bioethics master.
[14:40.740 --> 14:43.740]  The new term again for eugenics.
[14:43.740 --> 14:44.740]  Let's take a call.
[14:44.740 --> 14:45.740]  Can we take some calls here?
[14:45.740 --> 14:46.740]  You want to do that?
[14:46.740 --> 14:47.740]  Okay.
[14:47.740 --> 14:49.740]  Let's talk to Rebecca in California.
[14:49.740 --> 14:52.740]  Rebecca, I know you were holding before our guest came on, but I'm sure you want to comment on this.
[14:52.740 --> 14:53.740]  Rebecca, go ahead, you're on the air.
[14:53.740 --> 14:58.740]  Yeah, I have a couple of questions about the thyroid you were talking about earlier
[14:58.740 --> 15:02.740]  and then I do have something to say to Ruth.
[15:02.740 --> 15:03.740]  I don't know if you have an answer.
[15:03.740 --> 15:07.740]  Let's have your comment to Ruth first and then you can ask your thyroid question about radiation.
[15:07.740 --> 15:09.740]  Okay.
[15:09.740 --> 15:14.740]  I just wanted to say, Ruth, I understand how you feel, although your situation is different than mine.
[15:14.740 --> 15:15.740]  I'm in fertile 2.
[15:15.740 --> 15:16.740]  I have no children.
[15:16.740 --> 15:18.740]  I'm probably about your age.
[15:18.740 --> 15:23.740]  My mom was given DES, diethylstilbestrol, back in the 50s.
[15:23.740 --> 15:26.740]  They did that and they did it all the way up into the 60s and 70s
[15:26.740 --> 15:29.740]  and I don't know if that wasn't for sterilization.
[15:29.740 --> 15:31.740]  All on purpose.
[15:31.740 --> 15:32.740]  I think so.
[15:32.740 --> 15:33.740]  I've seen the reports on it.
[15:33.740 --> 15:37.740]  There are so many women that are in fertile because of this.
[15:37.740 --> 15:41.740]  Sperm counts down 70 plus percent here, 85 percent in Europe.
[15:41.740 --> 15:47.740]  Yeah, and I don't, there's no history of infertility in my family, so I have a feeling that this was on purpose.
[15:47.740 --> 15:50.740]  It was the beginning, or perhaps the middle, I don't know.
[15:50.740 --> 15:58.740]  But Ruth, when they first put you in the mental institution, for what reason did they do that?
[15:58.740 --> 16:01.740]  I mean, they get you into a place and they do something to you,
[16:01.740 --> 16:06.740]  but what was the purpose of putting you there in the first place?
[16:06.740 --> 16:13.740]  When my mom was living, she decided that she wanted me to get more training.
[16:13.740 --> 16:24.740]  And after she passed away, my dad decided that I should go to Fairview and get more training.
[16:25.740 --> 16:27.740]  By training, you have some disabilities, you're saying?
[16:27.740 --> 16:29.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:29.740 --> 16:37.740]  Okay, see folks, this is what they would do if you were handicapped, if you were partially paralyzed,
[16:37.740 --> 16:43.740]  learning disabilities under a B plus, now this is front line, this is PBS.
[16:43.740 --> 16:44.740]  I've seen the documents.
[16:44.740 --> 16:49.740]  Under a B plus, you were thrown in a mental institution and sterilized.
[16:49.740 --> 16:52.740]  So did you have learning disabilities or what was wrong?
[16:52.740 --> 16:56.740]  Yeah, I had brain damage.
[16:56.740 --> 16:58.740]  Oh, from an automobile accident or from burns?
[16:58.740 --> 17:04.740]  No, when I was four years old, I ran a real, real high fever.
[17:04.740 --> 17:05.740]  See, there you go.
[17:05.740 --> 17:07.740]  Vaccination.
[17:07.740 --> 17:08.740]  Probably.
[17:08.740 --> 17:09.740]  Probably.
[17:09.740 --> 17:13.740]  All right, your question about potassium iodate?
[17:13.740 --> 17:18.740]  Okay, for example, my mother had her thyroid removed.
[17:18.740 --> 17:19.740]  She doesn't have a thyroid.
[17:19.740 --> 17:21.740]  So she thinks, I don't need to take that.
[17:21.740 --> 17:22.740]  I don't need to have any of that.
[17:22.740 --> 17:23.740]  I don't have a thyroid.
[17:23.740 --> 17:24.740]  What could be damaged?
[17:24.740 --> 17:26.740]  Well, that's true.
[17:26.740 --> 17:32.740]  Now, if there's a person that doesn't have a thyroid and they're exposed to this, are they just okay?
[17:32.740 --> 17:35.740]  No, it'll just precipitate out into their organs.
[17:35.740 --> 17:40.740]  But the main cause of death of radiation exposure is concentration of radiation in the thyroid.
[17:40.740 --> 17:43.740]  potassium iodate is only to block and shield the thyroid.
[17:43.740 --> 17:44.740]  So your mother is correct.
[17:44.740 --> 17:45.740]  Thanks for the call.
[17:45.740 --> 17:46.740]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[17:48.740 --> 17:53.740]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[17:53.740 --> 17:56.740]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[17:59.740 --> 18:05.740]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[18:05.740 --> 18:08.740]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[18:08.740 --> 18:14.740]  Thank you for joining me today, the 5th of December, 2002.
[18:14.740 --> 18:17.740]  If you'd like to talk to our guest, Ruth Morris, she'll be with us for a few more minutes.
[18:17.740 --> 18:27.740]  The toll-free number 1-800-259-9231.
[18:27.740 --> 18:32.740]  Ruth Morris, is there anything else you'd like to add before we take a few final calls?
[18:32.740 --> 18:35.740]  I can't add anything else.
[18:35.740 --> 18:37.740]  Yeah, I can.
[18:37.740 --> 18:44.740]  I hope that other states will follow Oregon's lead.
[18:44.740 --> 18:48.740]  Well, certainly, you know, Virginia apologized.
[18:48.740 --> 18:50.740]  After they got caught, their numbers were much higher.
[18:50.740 --> 18:53.740]  They admitted in the tens of thousands.
[18:53.740 --> 18:56.740]  But it was actually much higher than that in that one state.
[18:56.740 --> 18:59.740]  Now, I want to add a caveat to this.
[18:59.740 --> 19:03.740]  I want to warn you that through the vaccines, and this is in my film, The Road to Tyranny,
[19:03.740 --> 19:07.740]  you can download it for free at infowars.com, the video clip section,
[19:07.740 --> 19:11.740]  we have the mainstream Australian papers where their government planned
[19:11.740 --> 19:17.740]  to use biological weapons in and outside of vaccines to be given in so-called aid packages to Asia,
[19:17.740 --> 19:23.740]  also to put it in the rice and food to sterilize Asia.
[19:23.740 --> 19:26.740]  Yes, and so this is the eugenics plan today.
[19:26.740 --> 19:30.740]  And that's why fertility in women is dropping off by 50%.
[19:30.740 --> 19:33.740]  This is why women can't have children.
[19:33.740 --> 19:37.740]  This is why men are losing their sperm count in massive levels.
[19:37.740 --> 19:43.740]  They say at current rates, in two decades, only 2% of men will be able to impregnate a woman.
[19:43.740 --> 19:49.740]  Again, 75% here in the U.S., 80-plus percent sperm reduction rate in Europe.
[19:49.740 --> 19:52.740]  This is being done scientifically.
[19:52.740 --> 19:58.740]  And this is the new evil, the new eugenics program we must expose together.
[19:58.740 --> 20:00.740]  So how is the government responding?
[20:00.740 --> 20:04.740]  They're saying, we will make it a law, we can inject you with whatever we want, whenever we want,
[20:04.740 --> 20:07.740]  and you can't sue the vaccine makers.
[20:07.740 --> 20:11.740]  Let's talk to Doris in Arkansas. Doris, you're on the air, welcome to the airwaves.
[20:11.740 --> 20:25.740]  Alex, I want to verify what you were saying about the institutions that were sterilizing their patients.
[20:25.740 --> 20:28.740]  Verifying, I mean, it's all over the news.
[20:28.740 --> 20:31.740]  Well, I think it's more widespread than probably you even think,
[20:31.740 --> 20:38.740]  because I worked in a mental-retarded training center in Kansas in the early 80s,
[20:38.740 --> 20:44.740]  and all of their patients were sterilized.
[20:44.740 --> 20:45.740]  Are you there?
[20:45.740 --> 20:46.740]  Incredible.
[20:46.740 --> 20:54.740]  And I knew a couple that got married that were somewhat retarded, they still took care of each other,
[20:54.740 --> 20:59.740]  but the judge at that time wouldn't allow them to get married until they were sterilized,
[20:59.740 --> 21:03.740]  and that was way back in the early 60s.
[21:03.740 --> 21:06.740]  And he had no law to do that, it was just judicial.
[21:06.740 --> 21:09.740]  He wouldn't marry them until they were sterilized.
[21:09.740 --> 21:12.740]  And they didn't know, because they were...
[21:12.740 --> 21:15.740]  Well, I just want to point out that under B-Plus was considered retarded.
[21:15.740 --> 21:20.740]  He came from a single-parent home, CNN reports, just in case you doubt me, let me read the article again.
[21:20.740 --> 21:27.740]  Girls in reform school, people in mental institutions, and poor women selected by welfare workers.
[21:27.740 --> 21:36.740]  Well, I think that if you would look into the past, that most of the mental institutions, the people were sterilized.
[21:36.740 --> 21:38.740]  It's a lot more evident than you would ever read.
[21:38.740 --> 21:45.740]  Well, my father was going to, in college, he worked a few semesters, state hospital here in Austin,
[21:45.740 --> 21:50.740]  and he said that every sadistic freak you can imagine worked there.
[21:50.740 --> 21:54.740]  That's why he got out of and got another job here in college here in Austin.
[21:54.740 --> 21:57.740]  And they enjoyed torturing people.
[21:57.740 --> 22:04.740]  Also, in high school during the summers, he would work as an intern at MD Anderson Cancer Research Facility.
[22:04.740 --> 22:10.740]  He said he would watch the doctors enjoying torturing animals, enjoying torturing monkeys and rats,
[22:10.740 --> 22:14.740]  and even human beings that had signed waivers to have cancer tests done.
[22:14.740 --> 22:18.740]  He said that it's just a sick group, by and large.
[22:18.740 --> 22:26.740]  Well, Alex, you know, I'm curious if that tetanus shot that they gave in Africa to sterilize a lot of those people,
[22:26.740 --> 22:30.740]  is that the same one that they've used a lot in the United States?
[22:30.740 --> 22:41.740]  Well, they found it in the MMR shot of a pathogen, an immunogen of hormone and tetanus that attacks the cerebral cortex and toddler development.
[22:41.740 --> 22:51.740]  They have found cancer viruses in about a dozen varieties of major vaccines, not just SV40 monkey virus in the polio shots into the 70s.
[22:51.740 --> 22:54.740]  It's tough today.
[22:54.740 --> 23:01.740]  It's funny, they gave a tetanus shot to old school students, 3,000, in the Mesa, Arizona, school district two weeks ago.
[23:01.740 --> 23:05.740]  The U.S. Army involved, we had the fire department on inventing it.
[23:05.740 --> 23:11.740]  I wonder if that lot number could be traced and whether it's the same thing they gave to sterilize women.
[23:11.740 --> 23:14.740]  I do know some women that are...
[23:14.740 --> 23:15.740]  No, that'll be interesting.
[23:15.740 --> 23:18.740]  Hold on a second, Doris.
[23:18.740 --> 23:22.740]  Let's follow the women that were injected 10 years from now.
[23:22.740 --> 23:25.740]  Let's see, statistically, somebody should do that.
[23:25.740 --> 23:29.740]  Let's follow them and see if they have a higher level of infertility.
[23:29.740 --> 23:30.740]  Go ahead.
[23:30.740 --> 23:35.740]  Right, but we need to trace the lot numbers and compare them to what they used to sterilize women.
[23:35.740 --> 23:43.740]  We know it was shipped in by the Army, according to the assistant fire chief, especially for the children.
[23:43.740 --> 23:52.740]  Well, Ruth, I'm very sorry about what's happened to you and for all of the others across the country.
[23:52.740 --> 23:54.740]  Well, thank you.
[23:54.740 --> 23:56.740]  Thanks, Doris.
[23:56.740 --> 23:59.740]  Ruth Morris, I appreciate your courage coming on the show.
[23:59.740 --> 24:00.740]  Oh, you're welcome.
[24:00.740 --> 24:04.740]  Are you involved with an organization or a website or if folks want to contact you,
[24:04.740 --> 24:07.740]  try to aid you to get some compensation or others,
[24:07.740 --> 24:12.740]  what are some of the organizations that people can check out or do you have any of the websites where people can do that?
[24:12.740 --> 24:20.740]  Okay, I belong to two organizations called People First of Oregon.
[24:20.740 --> 24:22.740]  I forgot the website.
[24:22.740 --> 24:26.740]  Well, just type in People First of Oregon into a Google search engine, you should have it.
[24:26.740 --> 24:28.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:28.740 --> 24:34.740]  And then I'm belonging to a group here in Eugene called People First of Eugene.
[24:34.740 --> 24:35.740]  Say it again.
[24:35.740 --> 24:38.740]  People First of Eugene.
[24:38.740 --> 24:42.740]  People First of Eugene, Oregon, okay.
[24:42.740 --> 24:44.740]  Well, again, any final comments?
[24:44.740 --> 24:46.740]  I'm just, I'm pained by what they did to you.
[24:46.740 --> 24:49.740]  I'm pained by the crimes they're committing right now against us.
[24:49.740 --> 24:51.740]  Any final comments, Ruth?
[24:51.740 --> 24:57.740]  No, but I enjoy talking to you, talking to the people.
[24:57.740 --> 25:00.740]  You know, you're obviously an intelligent person,
[25:00.740 --> 25:06.740]  and I'm sorry that it's obvious, as you said, your mother and your father thought the government was good,
[25:06.740 --> 25:11.740]  tried to put you in, quote, training because of the brain damage you got that you obviously rebounded from,
[25:11.740 --> 25:14.740]  from the fever you suffered at the age of five.
[25:14.740 --> 25:18.740]  And I'm sorry they did this to you, but they were just shutting a precedent of evil.
[25:18.740 --> 25:22.740]  And I'm glad you're still alive and doing good to put the word out.
[25:22.740 --> 25:24.740]  And I hope you get some compensation.
[25:24.740 --> 25:28.740]  Have lawsuits been filed to demand financial compensation?
[25:28.740 --> 25:32.740]  I don't know if they did or not, but I will keep you informed.
[25:32.740 --> 25:33.740]  All right, thank you, Ruth Morris.
[25:33.740 --> 25:35.740]  You're welcome.
[25:35.740 --> 25:36.740]  Take care.
[25:36.740 --> 25:38.740]  Oh, man.
[25:38.740 --> 25:43.740]  And now the governor gets caught three months ago destroying all records of the incredible mass sterilizations,
[25:43.740 --> 25:50.740]  only 3,000 records that were claiming 2,500, but now 3,000 from some of the lawsuits have gotten out.
[25:50.740 --> 25:54.740]  The numbers are probably much, much higher, of course.
[25:54.740 --> 26:05.740]  The number, the mainstream number nationwide out of 50 states sits from 1917 to 1983 at 400 plus thousand.
[26:05.740 --> 26:10.740]  So we're coming up to a close half mil.
[26:10.740 --> 26:13.740]  You go out, you take your vaccines, okay?
[26:13.740 --> 26:15.740]  You let the Army give it to you at the checkpoint.
[26:15.740 --> 26:16.740]  You go ahead and go to your FEMA camp.
[26:16.740 --> 26:17.740]  Don't resist.
[26:17.740 --> 26:18.740]  They love you.
[26:18.740 --> 26:20.740]  The government cares about you and your family.
[26:20.740 --> 26:22.740]  Hand over your fire eyes.
