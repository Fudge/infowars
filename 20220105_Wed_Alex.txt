[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today, January 5th.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.000]  Let's go Brandon.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.000]  Let's go Brandon, I agree.
[00:37.000 --> 00:39.000]  I don't think it's fundamentally about insubility.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  I think it is fundamentally about insurrection.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  You know, I don't know the individual,
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  but the whole let's go Brandon kind of motif
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  is a reflection of the view,
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  two-thirds of the Republican base
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  driven by Trump's claims,
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  false claims and the big lie,
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  that Biden is an illegitimate president.
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  You talk about the wheels coming off the globalist operation.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  You talk about the engine blowing up.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  You talk about the house burning down.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  The globalists know their corrupt system is coming to an end.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  And they're trying to take capitalism with it,
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  when it's not capitalism that caused this,
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  but crony capitalism and corrupt financiers
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  working with authoritarian regimes to create monopolies.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  So they know their monopolistic New World Order,
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  great reset, is coming to an end.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  They understand that and they don't know what to do.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  So crisis has shown us we need a mindset change
[01:34.000 --> 01:42.000]  and we need also to move from a society
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  where business and governments have very separate tasks
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  to a society where the two together with civil society
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  work hand in hand.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  Far more quickly, small businesses have suffered terribly.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  How has that...
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  Not the philosophy of stakeholder capitalism,
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  but the ability of companies across the spectrum to execute it?
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  You ask me?
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  Yeah.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  Yeah.
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.000]  Yes.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  Great question to you and then we'll open to the group.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  They're global.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  What is this great reset?
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  What the great reset is,
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  is a bunch of global elites, as you said,
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  and they have two protocols or two themes.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  One is that their credentials or their education
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  or their inherited or made wealth make them elites
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  and allow them to talk down to people
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  and by top-down measures dictate to people
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  in a non-democratic way what's good for them.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  And second, their power and influence and wealth
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  mean they're never going to be subject to the ramifications
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  of their own ideology because they're exempt.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  Capitalism made them wealth, but they don't want capitalism
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.000]  for anybody else.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  They want to close the attic door so nobody
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.000]  climbs up after them.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  And so they're going to engineer an artificial collapse
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  so they can be the saviors of the collapse,
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  so they have all the PR straight and all the propaganda straight
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  so that as things disintegrate, they can pose as the saviors
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  and hopefully stay in charge of this controlled demolition
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.000]  that they have executed.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  But it's not going the way tyrants always wanted to go.
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.000]  It's getting out of control.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  So they're upping the level of control.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  They're accelerating the collapse.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  And they've basically lost control now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  Only a mass awakening of the public can get control of the train
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  before it goes over the edge into the ravine.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  Most people I now know with COVID are those who are double or triple vaccinated.
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  They're getting so ill.
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  So what they're trying to do is get you to do a virtue symbol.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  They're trying to say, where are you masked?
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  So I'm a good person.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  I'm a good Christian.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  I'm protecting people.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  No, you're not. You're showing that you're gagged.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  And you're not speaking up for the truth.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  My husband is a vicar in the Church of England.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  When we're actually in the height of the pandemic,
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  he was very, very quiet on funerals.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  There was very, very few funerals at all.
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.000]  People were not dying.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  And one of my sons actually was in hospital.
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  The hospital was dead.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  Paul Hospital was absolutely empty.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  I got straight into A&E, no problem at all.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  Now, since the vaccine rollout, there's been funeral after funeral after funeral.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  We know undertakers in the area,
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  undertakers have spoken out.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  What is killing people now is vaccine injury.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  Whether you can relate it or not,
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  but it's heart attacks, stroke, blood clots, myocarditis,
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  inflammation of the heart,
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  or later down the line, it's going to be cancer.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  Masses, having a giant epiphany,
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  a giant chain reaction awakening,
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  can and will stop them.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  The majority of the people at the top now,
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  you wonder why they're so evil, why they follow orders.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  They think get out of jail free cards.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  So that's who these people are.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  It's about their power, their control, their God.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  They can do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  for what the globalists are doing right now.
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  This is their big offensive.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  This is their takeover.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now
[05:13.000 --> 05:14.000]  they've revealed themselves.
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law,
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed,
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  but they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  and shut down people telling the truth.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast,
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the sphere.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  Plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers, they are so good for your body.
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  And if there's two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[05:51.000 --> 05:56.000]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[05:56.000 --> 06:18.000]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  COVID is a deadly pandemic.
[06:20.000 --> 06:23.000]  It killed science, logic, evidence-based medicine.
[06:23.000 --> 06:29.000]  Dr. Eli David says, reports FDA accused of colluding with USPS to stop
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  and destroy packages of ivermectin mailed to patients.
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  That's now confirmed.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  Criminal beyond Nuremberg Crimes.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  This is a drug that the WHO has on its list of most essential drugs.
[06:41.000 --> 06:42.000]  Are you kidding me?
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000]  And it's clearly, one of the largest studies, or the largest study, I think,
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  was just published from Brazil, 220,000 adults.
[06:51.000 --> 06:58.000]  And ivermectin decreased the risk of going down with this by, I think,
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  death and going to hospital by 50%.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  I wish the USPS would try to stop the fentanyl killing millions of people.
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  More than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in the last year.
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  That is the highest overdose death toll ever recorded in a 12-month period.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 100,300 Americans.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  Died of overdoses between May of 2020 and April of 2021.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  That is a 28% increase on the previous year.
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.000]  Totally safe drug.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  They're not going to let evil Americans order that from outside countries,
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  even if a doctor prescribes it.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  What we're dealing with is a huge mass mind control propaganda outbreak.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  We're not really dealing with a viral outbreak.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  What the heck happened in Germany in the 20s and 30s?
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  Very intelligent, highly educated population, and they went barking mad.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  How did that happen?
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  The answer is mass formation psychosis.
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.000]  and has free-floating anxiety in a sense that things don't make sense,
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  we can't understand it.
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  And then their attention gets focused by a leader or series of events
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  on one small point, just like hypnosis.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  They literally become hypnotized and can be led anywhere.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  And one of the aspects of that phenomena is the people that they identify as their leaders,
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  the ones typically that come in and say,
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  you have this pain and I can solve it for you.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  I and I alone can fix this problem for you.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  Then they will follow that person.
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  It doesn't matter whether they lie to them or whatever.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  The data are irrelevant.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  And furthermore, anybody who questions that narrative is to be immediately attacked.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  They are the other.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  This is central to mass formation psychosis.
[08:47.000 --> 08:54.000]  I'm starting to see people that are younger people that are getting sick with something.
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  But if you look at what we know about, for example, electromagnetic frequency toxicity,
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  it's indistinguishable from COVID, from what they call COVID.
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  We don't have a nice little virus.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000]  We're being told there's a virus.
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  We're being told it's airborne.
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  We're being told a lot of things that are not proven.
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.000]  But we do know something about electromagnetic frequency and the history behind the pandemic of 1918,
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  various flu pandemics in the past.
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  What happens is when you're in an electromagnetic field,
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.000]  your metabolism depends on you being able to have an electron transport chain in your mitochondria.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  The mitochondria are the little parts of your cells that are like your furnaces.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  They would produce power from food.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  And when you disrupt that electron chain ever so slightly,
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  you disrupt your ability to optimally metabolize food.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  And that's essentially what happens if you're toxic from radiofrequency radiation, non-ionizing radiation.
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  The telecommunications industry has the same indemnity from lawsuit that the vaccine industry does.
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  But you don't like one vaccine and suddenly you're an anti-vaxxer.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  And, you know, you're a tinfoil hat if you speak against 5G.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  I think that we see a pattern here.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  The answer is not to argue the science.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  The answer is to demonize the people speaking out.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  Hey, everybody. Cohen here with Cohen's Phone Repairs.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  Today I have an update on 5G.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  Now, everybody says don't get a 5G phone because they're dangerous because of the 5G.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  Now, I have two 5G phones in front of me.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  Right there is where the 5G chip is supposed to be.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  And right there is where the 5G chip is supposed to be.
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  I try to break this to everybody, but every phone, and again, I fix phones every day,
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.000]  so you can take me, you can take this from a reliable source.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  There's not a single phone in Canada that supports 5G.
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  There's not a single carrier in Canada that supports 5G.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  It's a marketing scam.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  There's no such thing as 5G in this phone.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  What you're investing in is 5G for the future.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  So they're charging $200 extra for 5G when it's not even there.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  I don't know if this speaks wonders to you,
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  but I think the government's doing other things with the 5G towers.
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  So if this doesn't say something to you, I don't know what will.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  But again, I fix phones every day,
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  and every 5G phone I fix does not even have a 5G chip in it.
[11:13.000 --> 11:38.000]  And right there is where it's supposed to go.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  One of the weirdest features of modern life has got to be
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  how we've all been trained to ignore the things that really matter.
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  You might have wonders to pick one among so many examples
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  why hundreds of thousands of your fellow Americans
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  seem to be living in squalor on the sidewalk.
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.000]  How'd that happen?
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  These are the so-called homeless.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  Drugs have destroyed their lives.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  So where'd those drugs come from exactly?
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  And why is no one asking?
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  And speaking of chemicals, men in America
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  seem very different from what they used to be.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  Anyone over 40 knows this.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  The changes are dramatic.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  You can't help but notice.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  Could those changes have something to do with the unprecedented drop
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.000]  in testosterone levels that scientists have measured repeatedly?
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  And by the way, if that's happening, why is it happening?
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  And so on. There's so many questions like this.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  But we rarely talk about any of them.
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  Instead, we're told repeatedly to avert our gaze from the obvious
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  and turn instead to CNN's latest fixation,
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  whether it's a Chinese flu virus or George Floyd
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  or some forgettable border dispute in eastern Ukraine.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  These are the issues they tell us we must care about.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  But they're wrong.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  These are not the most important issues.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  They're just news stories.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  The only remarkable thing about them is our willingness
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  to believe they're more important than, say,
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  Americans living outdoors on the sidewalk
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  or whether or not our own children get married.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  There's something a little scary about watching this happen.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  It's an entire population transfixed by issues
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  that ultimately don't really matter.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  How's that going to work out?
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  Well, over time, probably not very well.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  Reality always reasserts itself.
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  Twitter can ban all the thought criminals it wants,
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  but in the end, Twitter is not in charge of the future.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  Nature is in charge of the future.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  If you want your country to continue,
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  you have to answer nature's imperatives, which are the basics.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  Do you have enough water?
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  Do you have a reliable food supply?
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  Can you defend yourself from invaders?
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  What are you using for energy?
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  How are you producing things and keeping warm?
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Those are the essential questions
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  that any civilization must ask.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  Those and one other.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  How many people do you want living in your country?
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  The size of your population matters very much.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  The size determines a nation's character.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  It often determines its fate.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  Yet we don't talk much about the size of our population.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  We probably should.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  The United States is growing faster than most Americans understand.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  If you were born in 1969, as some of us were,
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  you arrived in a country with a little over 200 million people in it.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  There are now 334 million people in it.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  That's an awful lot of new people in an awfully short time.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  How many people is that exactly?
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  Well, it's nearly twice the population of the entire western United States.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  That's 13 states, including California.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  That is massive and incredibly rapid demographic growth.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  Last night, Tucker Carlson's 15-minute monologue
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  is his most important work yet.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  And when he's doing his laying the groundwork
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  to expose the great reset,
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  that is the design collapse of civilization.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  Don't upgrade the infrastructure,
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  destroy the currency,
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  deindustrialize the nation,
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  demoralize the public,
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  drug the public,
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  and then bring it down, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  Now, I got on air today 14 minutes late.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  And it's because I'm really codifying in my mind
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  ultramassive news that will change the course of the planet
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  and save this country if we listen to it and research it and do it.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  And, you know, I'm not a pretentious person.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  I know our listeners aren't.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  And that's kind of a blind spot we have.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  It's good to not be pretentious,
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  but it's also dangerous when you are extremely influential
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  and you know what's going on
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  and you have knowledge about it,
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  not to do anything about it.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  I got up early this morning and I saw an article that I read
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  and I know it's true because I know all about it.
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  And for some reason, I haven't told you about this
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  because it's so huge.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  I just for some reason haven't gone there.
[15:53.000 --> 16:22.000]  Well, I will when we come back. Stay with us.
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  Thank you very much.
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  At infowarstore.com, 50% off for a limited time.
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.000]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  we put in InfoWars live products.
[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  And that's why for more than two years
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients.
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  So out of all the bone broths out there,
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  I'm telling you this is next level.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  for better flavor and dissolvability.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom,
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.000]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries,
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  the turbocharger body with antioxidants.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  And it just goes on and on.
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus,
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  available at 20% off and free shipping
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  This is a great sponsor.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  on a high quality, high rated satellite phone.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  So you can't be tracked, you can't be traced.
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.000]  It'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  in your house that also are on the site infowarstone.com.
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  They supply the board control everybody with their systems
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  as well, they're amazing folks,
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  and you get a free phone of $600 to $50 value,
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  absolutely free at infowarstone.com.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  These aren't.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes,
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  $150 minutes.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  So the calls you were free works like a regular cell phone,
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  you're not being tracked or traced.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  And I keep one in my car, I've given it to my parents as gifts
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[18:51.000 --> 18:58.000]  infowarstone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  people talking bad about the vaccines are working for, quote,
[19:07.000 --> 19:14.000]  the dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  evil groups are.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  They know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  by major governments.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  They know that the people are starting to get wise
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  this depopulation agenda.
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  to be soft kill weapons, but they're so deadly they're killing a higher
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  percentage up front and so people are waking up.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  The weapons work a little too good.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars,
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  but instead they're making too big of a noise.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  But it's too late for them to turn back now.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  They're coming after our children.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  So it's up to us to protect our little children,
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  or God will not look favorably on us.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  Remember, God is watching.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday,
[20:19.000 --> 20:20.000]  January 5th.
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  Broadcast.
[20:22.000 --> 20:25.000]  Okay.
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  Let me just set this up this way.
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.000]  We have 100% proof up one side and down the other.
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  We have just incredible documentation that,
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  is my mic going in and out in there, guys, for you?
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  My mic's going in and out.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  You guys don't know?
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  I mean, my mic's cutting in and out.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  I got to go to rebroadcast.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  I just, oh, my God.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  Okay.
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.000]  Oh, Jesus.
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.000]  Oh, my Lord.
[21:00.000 --> 21:01.000]  I can't do it.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  Just got to rebroadcast.
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  I'm sorry.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  I can't handle this anymore.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  It's not the crew.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  I just, it's like the more important the broadcast,
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  the Dan Grimlins pop up and it just is a distraction
[21:11.000 --> 21:19.000]  from what I'm about to cover.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  What do we got to air, guys?
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.000]  Get something ready.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  Just go back to Tucker's monologue.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  I'm out of here.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  Across our borders illegally.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  All of them arrived with the blessing of the White House.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  It makes you wonder what sort of economy Joe Biden imagines
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  we're going to have going forward.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  Domestic manufacturing is in steep decline.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  Automation is replacing many of the low-skilled jobs
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.000]  that still remain.
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  So what are these millions of new people going to be doing
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  for work 20 years from now?
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  They can't all be Nancy Pelosi's housekeepers.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  They can't all bus tables at the French Laundry in Napa.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  And not all of them will, thank God.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  In spite of the Democratic Party's best efforts
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  to import a permanent surf class to serve its donors,
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  some of these immigrants will rise higher
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  than Nancy Pelosi expects they will.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  Some will fight their way to the top of our society,
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  with the usual combination of inborn talent and grit.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  And honestly, bless them for that.
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.000]  No one invited them here.
[22:14.000 --> 22:15.000]  We didn't want them to come,
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  but we will be sincerely glad when they succeed.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  And yet, a country is more than the success
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  of a handful of people inspiring as that always is to watch.
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  Sheer numbers matter too.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  Even if every single person
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  who's snuck across our southern border this year
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  goes on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry,
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  it would still be worth worrying about the effects
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  that mass immigration have on our total population numbers.
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  So the question is, how many people is too many?
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  In Washington, you will never hear that question.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  More bodies in a country mean more power
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  for the people who run it.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  Big nations need big governments.
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  Politicians always want more people to rule,
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  so the incentive for unrestrained population growth
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  is baked right into the system.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  That's bad news for the rest of us.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  First and most obviously,
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  big governments don't treat their citizens very well.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  Yes, that's a Reagan-era talking point.
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  It's also true.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  The larger a bureaucracy becomes,
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  the more impersonal it gets.
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  Past a certain size, organizations of any kind
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  lose their regard for people.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  As they get bigger, they get blunter,
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  more soulless and cruel.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  People in charge no longer care what you think.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  They don't have to worry about how their policies
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  will affect you or your family.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  And that's the inevitable product of population growth.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  If you had five children, you would bathe them all
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  in love and attention.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  If you had 5,000 children,
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  you wouldn't know their names.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  So in case you're wondering why our leaders
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  no longer seem especially interested in your health
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  or happiness or prosperity, that's the reason.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  They don't have to be interested.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  Our population's too big.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  Why should your opinion matter?
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  You're one of many.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  Previous generations of Americans
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  didn't live in a country like this,
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  and they would be stunned by the attitudes
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  that are so common now, attitudes we take for granted.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  Arresting people for walking through the U.S.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  Capitol building?
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  How is that a crime,
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  19th century Americans would wonder?
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  For most of our history, Americans believed
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  they owned the Capitol.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  They thought it was theirs because they assumed
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  this was their country.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  Political leaders told them that it was.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  After the 1904 presidential election,
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  Teddy Roosevelt greeted voters in person
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  on the lawn of the White House.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  It was his home, he lived there,
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  but it belonged to them.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Attitudes like that are long gone.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  They're the victim of population growth.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  The Athenians invented democratic government,
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  but at its peak Athens only had about 8,000 voters.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  So past a certain scale,
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  democracy can't function very well.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  The concept of the citizen becomes too abstract.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  You see it in the way our leaders talk.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  Politicians barely mention individuals anymore.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  Instead they yammer on about voting blocks,
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  which are now called communities.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  The immigrant community, the trans community,
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  the Latino community, the black community.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  You hear these terms constantly,
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  but they are nonsensical.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  They don't mean anything.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  For example, there are about 47 million black people
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  in the United States.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  That's a community?
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.000]  No, it's not.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  By definition, 47 million people cannot be a community,
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  no matter what color the people within their home are.
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  They dehumanize you by saying you're in a group
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  so they can then take all your individual rights.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  And again, I'm not mad at the crew.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  And we did have a mic issue,
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  because we were changing microphones around today,
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  trying out a new one.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  And then right before the show,
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  I want to go back to my original microphone.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  And it's the same reason I wasn't on air for 15 minutes.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  I mean, this is earth-shattering information
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  we're going to be covering.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  This is as big as it gets.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  And I'm not trying to build it up here.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  Do you understand they're going to stage terror attacks,
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  and they're going to declare martial law,
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  and they're going to come,
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  and they're going to arrest the opposition leaders
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  and beat us to death in prisons.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  And then they're going to devalue the dollar completely
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  and start turning your power off on a regular basis
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  and inject your children with poisons until they slowly die.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  They're going to murder you.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  So everybody can sit around and play their games
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  that they're in the government,
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.000]  they're going to be part of the winning team.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  The fools working in the federal government
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  going along with this are destroying themselves
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  with us right along with them.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  And I saw news stories come out this morning
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  confirming, admitting,
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  that there were thousands of federal paramilitary,
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  including U.S. military, there,
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  and we never talked about it,
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  because it was extremely classified.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  And the people I know the information from
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  obviously can't get into it.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  But see, they hide behind the classification of January 6.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  We know how they did it.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  We know who did it.
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  The freaking FBI ran the attack on the Capitol,
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  and we have all the damn information.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  And people say, well, why didn't you cover it all?
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Because when you're in the middle of this
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  and all this stuff is going on and happening,
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  and then you just subconsciously know,
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  you go there, they come set you up and kill you.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  Well, do you know what?
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  We're releasing it all.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  Burn in hell.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  But again, it's the fact that it's all hiding in plain view.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  And then they work with a secret service
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  to try to set me and Roger Stone up,
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  and then they got the nerve with all those criminals
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  in Capitol Hill to try to say, I'm behind the damn attack.
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  So I'm pissed.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  Okay, I'm not pissed at the crew.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  I'm not pissed at anybody but these criminals.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  And I can barely do the show.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  Freaking BS, man.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  Bunch of damn criminals run in this country.
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  Fuck them.
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  Fuck them.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  I'm sick of their shit.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  Fuck these motherfuckers.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  See, I got to go to rebroadcast.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  All right, I'm going to call God, please help me.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  Please God help me.
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  I'm so sick of these criminals.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  Does everybody get we're all going to get destroyed?
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  These are serious killers, serious criminals.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  All these morons going along with the great reset
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  are destroying their own future
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  and just sitting there like you're on a winning team,
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  bringing in pure evil.
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  That evil is going to destroy you.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  But you're delusional and think you're part of the team.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  Think it's all cute what you guys have done.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  And you sit there and you follow your orders.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  We're going to go to break.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  And I'm going to come back and I'm just going to tell you
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  that we have two special guests in studio today.
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  Mike Adams is going to be in studio.
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  I've been here a while.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  And then we have another military doctor coming in
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  to blow light up in the whole New World Order takeover.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  The brainwashing, I'm going to settle down there too.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  And then we have a special guest on January 6th and the 4th hour.
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.000]  has only been the buildup for what the globalists are doing right now.
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  This is their big offensive.
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  This is their takeover.
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  because now they've revealed themselves.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  Now they're a world government.
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  They're permanent martial law.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  Their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  But they're using their corporate power and trillions
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast,
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.

[29:55.000 --> 29:59.000]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  It's in the rearview mirror.
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  But you can still take advantage of Christmas prices
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  going to the new year at infowarstore.com.

[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  that, you know, the media calls communists,
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  but really they're just a commune.
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[31:22.000 --> 31:23.000]  and we've got it.
[31:23.000 --> 31:25.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.000]  and the price has never gone up.
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  for about 50% more per pound.
[31:34.000 --> 31:35.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  you're going to find anywhere.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  We had like that.
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[31:48.000 --> 31:51.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[31:53.000 --> 32:18.000]  If you don't fund us and don't want us here, that's fine.

[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  when you visit infowarstore.com.

[32:47.000 --> 32:48.000]  We've got them for cell phones.
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  We've got them for laptops.
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.000]  We've got them for iPads.
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.

[32:55.000 --> 33:21.000]  and support the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[33:21.000 --> 33:39.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  So the New World Order has almost taken control of not just the U.S.
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  but the entire planet.
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  And along came Donald Trump,
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  who was engaged in the anti-globalist populist rhetoric
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  and also did a lot of good things to educate Americans about that.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  It was wonderful.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  And so they did what the feds and the globalists did back in 1995
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  when they staged the Oklahoma City bombing.
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  They went into one of Trump's biggest, most important rallies,
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  the most important,
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  and hijacked it with agent provocateurs
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.000]  that helped break through the lightly defended capital
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  because they'd sent half the police away to do,
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  quote, traffic control that day
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  and the National Guard under the control of the District of Columbia there
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.000]  refused Trump's request nine months before,
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  six months before, and a couple weeks before.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  And he could have overridden that,
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  but Millie said, no, we don't have the military on the streets in America.
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.000]  And he apologized that he'd ever even been seen with Trump
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  in public after riots.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  Remember all that?
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  And so then we got a million people there,
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  like all our other big rallies.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  It was peaceful except for a few antifa attacking people the night before.
[34:46.000 --> 34:52.000]  And then they said that Trump was going to go down to where the stage was.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  And he just thought it was all handled by the Secret Service.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  Everybody, it's always handled for him.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  And then we just marched in there to a total trap
[35:00.000 --> 35:07.000]  with this new information that's not new information.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  And I'm going to have a special guest on in the fourth hour
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  that is going to tell you what he saw in the days leading up to January 6th
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  and what he saw on January 6th.
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  And the reason that's important is he's the fellow in the security detail
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  that you see holding me when I'm on top of the big stack of chairs
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  because it was very precarious up there.
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  It was a pallet of unpacked chairs that hadn't been unpacked yet that were all stacked.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  And so you're standing up there trying not to fall down the hole
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.000]  that's in the chair there and the chairs laid on top of each other.
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  And he's an Army veteran and a good friend of mine
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.000]  and works with Info Wars and was a sergeant major in the military
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  and special operations and was run a lot of big operations.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  And he was there and saw people he knew.
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  And from the CIA, the FBI, the hostage rescue team, the Army,
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  they're running operations.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  He's like, whoa, this is crazy.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  And that morning he couldn't get text message done
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  because they'd shut everything down.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  You couldn't communicate. They were jamming everything.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  That they were already starting stuff as soon as Trump's speech began
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  with military precision.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  So he came back down and met us and we got to get down there.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  We got to stop this. They're pulling something off.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  We get there. Sure enough, it's happening.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  And then all the gear was there, the communication towers, all the stuff,
[36:28.000 --> 36:35.000]  the feds, their sheet-dip military, FBI directing everybody to attack.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  I mean, it's just all there.
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.000]  And I'm sitting here knowing this back at the time that it happened,
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.000]  knowing that it went on and telling you, hey, there were feds everywhere
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  and there was military there.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  And that's how we had a lot of intel that nobody else had.
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  The FBI hostage rescue team, once they'd mopped up,
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  most of the people did actually go and attack the couple of hundred stragglers
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  that stayed at the Capitol and in the Capitol.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  So that's news that nobody knows.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  And just a lot of other stuff, but I'm going to let him do the talking show
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  that he doesn't violate any of his national security agreements or any of that.
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  But as a citizen, what he saw and what went on, he's allowed to talk about.
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  Plus, we have all the video of it verifying this stuff.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  So why am I raising this now on the eve of the January 6th
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  and all the stuff that's coming out of that, all the things that are happening there?
[37:23.000 --> 37:29.000]  The reason I'm raising this is that I got up this morning and saw this,
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  actually last night I saw it, I saw this exclusive, secret commandos with
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  shoot to kill authority were at the Capitol.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  Thousands of them.
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  They didn't just have the FBI 350 hostage rescue team there.
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.000]  They had a bunch of other secret units there in the Capitol, outside the Capitol and playing close.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  Doesn't that validate what Tucker Carlson said about there being feds everywhere?
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  And they're up there on towers with flags directing people in.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  They're up there breaking through.
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.000]  We have the witnesses hand video of the individuals getting orders over their earpieces.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  As soon as Trump said go to the Capitol, then they got my radio.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  Okay, now order everybody to break in now.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  That way they could tie it directly to Trump because he didn't say go to the Capitol.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  They had Secret Service, double agent globalist inside the White House who were again
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  helping set up Trump the whole time and trying to set me up.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  And Roger Stone and the rest of it and we walked right into this false flag operation.
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  But the point is now the documents have been released and it's coming out in court
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  and they're trying to spin it like, oh, look, it's a good thing.
[38:33.000 --> 38:40.000]  There were 350 FBI hostage rescue teams, several thousand other FBI and playing close.
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  Also, obviously the army was there and they had a bunch of other units there.
[38:45.000 --> 38:52.000]  And all their compartmentalized but told to stand down while they watch maybe a hundred people
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  while Trump's giving a speech, start breaking through the barricades and then into the Capitol.
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  And again, we have all the witnesses in video of it. As soon as they get the word, by the minute,
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  Trump says, okay, I'm going to march peacefully to the Capitol.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  I'll join you there coming up at the speech. That was the middle of the speech.
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.000]  They all get the call on their earpieces, all right, go, go, go, go, go, go in.
[39:12.000 --> 39:19.000]  And again, they were using Q, which is the deep state disinfo ops from not other Democratic party in the CIA,
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.000]  to tell everybody on chat boards and everything, oh, you're going to be invading, the president's going to be there,
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.000]  this is the storm, you're about to take over, this is the moment it's all about to happen,
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  so that they could then trick the useful idiots, a very small percentage of the million folks that showed up,
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  to then go into the Capitol. Once you get a few hundred to break through, again with the FBI and the hostage rescue teams
[39:40.000 --> 39:47.000]  and the military and everybody watching with huge high tech, you know, six generation communication towers everywhere,
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  jamming all of our communications, so they could get their narrative out and control it and then say, Trump had done it.
[39:53.000 --> 40:00.000]  And then Trump doesn't even understand what happened here and doesn't even really point it out or call for investigations.
[40:00.000 --> 40:06.000]  He's talked about Ashley Abbott, that's good, he's talked about how the real insurrection was on, remember, third with the election fraud,
[40:06.000 --> 40:14.000]  that's true, but where is Trump on this? Because they are hanging it around his neck and the populist movement's neck in this country.
[40:14.000 --> 40:20.000]  And thousands of feds are there on the ground.
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.000]  We even had them come to our hotel and talk to us and people say, well, why don't you talk about what group it was?
[40:27.000 --> 40:36.000]  Because it's a secret agency, folks, and I'm not bound by all that, but because I have all these veterans that work for me,
[40:36.000 --> 40:42.000]  they are bound by that because they know what the equipment is, they know who the people are, they know what they're looking at, okay?
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  So that's where this starts getting, you know, serious.
[40:46.000 --> 40:53.000]  So maybe I should go testify to Congress. I know they're going to try to say I lie, so what? They're the liars, they're the criminals.
[40:53.000 --> 41:01.000]  That committee was involved, guaranteed, we have all the evidence, including Liz Chaining, working with the same groups
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  on multiple break-ins at the Capitol where they said go do sit-ins on the Trump-first impeachment.
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  They were trying to get violence going there and they failed.
[41:10.000 --> 41:18.000]  Yeah, oh yeah, that's all coming out. So the very people running that committee, the daughters of famous war criminals and others,
[41:18.000 --> 41:26.000]  are the ones who are the main suspects in all of this and Liz Chaining did finance and run and got the permit for the first impeachment rally
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  that broke into the Capitol and took over with the groups she sponsored.
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.000]  And I'm supposed to sit there and watch these criminals do all this and act like I'm the person that wanted to attack the Capitol
[41:37.000 --> 41:50.000]  when they have the motive, they have the history and that place was crawling from in the morning and the night before with black ops
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  and that's what unfolded.
[41:53.000 --> 42:01.000]  So then they start attacking before Trump's speech. They start breaking in during Trump's speech.
[42:01.000 --> 42:07.000]  He speaks another 45 minutes, gets in his car, goes back, watches, doesn't know what to do, waits about 45 minutes,
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  which I think was a little too long, to then go make his statement.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  But his staff kept saying wait, sir, more coming out, learn more.
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.000]  So now they can act like he didn't tell people to get out of the building while the feds were jamming all the communications,
[42:21.000 --> 42:32.000]  trying to block information, getting out to the public and running the whole damn thing and putting the police right in the middle of it.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  So that's the news and it's in Newsweek. We've got it linked up on infowars.com.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  Exclusive secret commandos with shoot to kill authority. We're at the Capitol.
[42:40.000 --> 42:46.000]  Fourth hour, we're going to be joined by our special guest who's going to lay out as much as he can.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  Here on air obviously at great risk to himself, but he's a patriot and he's going to do it.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  So that's all coming up. You want to know exactly what happened on January 6th?
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  You're about to learn. Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.

[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome. Go ahead.
[44:05.000 --> 44:06.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[44:06.000 --> 44:07.000]  Good, bro.
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.000]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[44:11.000 --> 44:16.000]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  The X2 group does wonders. They recommend it to everybody.
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the infowar.
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[44:38.000 --> 44:39.000]  Honored talk to you.
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.000]  Awesome.
[44:40.000 --> 44:46.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say, I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  It definitely works. It's not a joke.
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  Absolutely.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out.
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God,
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.000]  the Creator, and we are powerful.
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  So, that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy.
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  Is it true?
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.000]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.000]  because they know we are strong.
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.000]  And they know in the end, they signed on the God of this world who is a loser.
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep M4 Wars in the air now more than ever.
[45:49.000 --> 45:55.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe hand.
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.000]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in M4 Wars live products.
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.000]  And that's why for more than two years, we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.000]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients.
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  So, out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.000]  Cutting edge kickin' bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[46:27.000 --> 46:33.000]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and a bunch of other amazing
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.000]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  And it just goes on and on.
[46:50.000 --> 46:51.000]  It is now back in stock.
[46:51.000 --> 46:58.000]  Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off and free shipping out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[47:22.000 --> 47:27.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[47:27.000 --> 47:34.000]  And, you know, I'm not just upset about January 6 and how they're setting it up to be the way they turn loose the military
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  and the CIA and all these illegal operations against the American people.
[47:38.000 --> 47:39.000]  And then they're branding it.
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  They're rolling it out.
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  They're preparing it.
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  It's here.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  It's official.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  Total declaration of war against the country on every front.
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  We are an occupied nation.
[47:46.000 --> 47:56.000]  Blue cities and blue states are literally occupied by a foreign multinational corporate takeover of criminal pirates using behavioral psychology.
[47:56.000 --> 48:02.000]  And the only way to beat it is to recognize it and reject everything they say and everything they do.
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  You've got to harden yourself against this stuff.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  Then you get stronger instead of being demoralized and weak.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  Now, why do I get so angry?
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  I've got a stack of news where they're killing babies now around the world, giving them the damn shots and they're dying and having heart attacks.
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  And I've got articles going, it's normal for two-year-olds to have heart attacks now.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  I mean, it's all a test.
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  You see, hundreds of millions of boys around the world.
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  It's all over the world.
[48:31.000 --> 48:38.000]  Have autism now from a cocktail of reasons, but mainly autoimmune responses in the stomach and the brain from the injections.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  Because boys have much weaker blood-brain barriers.
[48:42.000 --> 48:51.000]  And when we didn't stand up for the children and when we didn't do anything, they just said, okay, hit them harder.
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  They're going to put up with it.
[48:52.000 --> 48:59.000]  And now if we don't stop this, can you imagine if major insurance companies are saying 40 or higher in some cases,
[48:59.000 --> 49:09.000]  the average is 40% increase in death of groups between 18 and 64.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  The working age, 18 to 64.
[49:12.000 --> 49:25.000]  I mean, I covered that yesterday from the CEO of a $100 billion company telling you this, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.000]  That's facts, that's science, that's mathematics, that's what's going on.
[49:30.000 --> 49:39.000]  And I can show you the CDC's own website admitting that they knew this would all happen a year and a half ago.
[49:39.000 --> 49:48.000]  Before anybody took the shot in October of 2020, so a year and a quarter.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  15 months ago, plus.
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  I mean, you can't get around that.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  And so what's the response?
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  Oh, Marjorie Taylor Greene talks about it.
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  She's banned.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  Oh, Trump talks about it.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  You're banned.
[50:02.000 --> 50:08.000]  Everybody's banned, banned, banned by these criminal big tech companies who are in bed with big pharma.
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  They've merged and they're literally carrying out a chemical bio attack on us.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  And they're literally coming at our children and killing them now.
[50:16.000 --> 50:22.000]  I mean, I have stacks of children dying, stacks of more soccer stars dying, stacks of more TV hosts that are young.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  Take the shot, follow over five heart attacks.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  I mean, it's just, they're murdering everybody.
[50:28.000 --> 50:38.000]  And then to learn, because we knew it at the time and we just didn't know the numbers and it wasn't in the news.
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  So I guess we were just waiting for Newsweek because it came out in federal court to report on it.
[50:42.000 --> 50:51.000]  But exclusive secret commandos would shoot to kill authority were at the Capitol watching it all unfold.
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  And we knew they were there.
[50:52.000 --> 51:01.000]  We talked about it that night saying there's military here and there's hostage rescue team here and there's feds and we have video that we've shown.
[51:01.000 --> 51:10.000]  We're digging it out right now of the HRT team that evening when a couple hundred people hadn't left and were still there and they went in and cleared them out.
[51:10.000 --> 51:16.000]  But they were there the whole time, ladies and gentlemen, the whole time.
[51:16.000 --> 51:26.000]  And then you add to that the secret service coming and saying, okay, Alex, you come lead it and opening the gate up at the front of the stage.
[51:26.000 --> 51:31.000]  There's Trump speaking right there 30 feet away.
[51:31.000 --> 51:40.000]  And then the White House spokesperson who was running that stuff from the campaign because that's your runs in his campaign people, not the White House itself comes over and says, okay, it's your time.
[51:40.000 --> 51:46.000]  Trump wants you to go lead it. I go lead it. There's already hundreds of thousands marching down to the Capitol.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  But okay, I'll try to go peacefully lead it.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  And there's the Secret Service taking us over there.
[51:51.000 --> 51:54.000]  They don't do that for anybody, folks.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  Okay, and I'm not saying all the Secret Service are bad.
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  They were following orders.
[51:58.000 --> 52:09.000]  But the people on the top were setting up Trump setting me up and setting Roger up to be the leaders of an attack on the Capitol where they had a bunch of people believing they were under orders from Trump via Q.
[52:09.000 --> 52:16.000]  And HN to go in and arrest Pelosi and others and put them in zip ties and that the military and commandos were about to join them.
[52:16.000 --> 52:28.000]  And the military commandos were there working for the globalist and were there so that it got out of hand and they could actually get people to actually kidnap Pelosi, which failed.
[52:28.000 --> 52:33.000]  Then the FBI was going to swoop in with the HRT and save Pelosi.
[52:33.000 --> 52:44.000]  But thank God the Republicans and Democrats were able to get out before that happened and before the brainwashed buffoons.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  And some of them were federal agents who believed they were actually part of it.
[52:48.000 --> 52:56.000]  They were set up as patsies to be there so that they would actually grab Pelosi or have a shootout and do all of this.
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  And can you imagine what they would have done then?
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  That's why they already had the pre-written scripts of this was worse than Pearl Harbor.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  This was worse than 9-11.
[53:05.000 --> 53:12.000]  Our dead are so many because they didn't even change the pre-written scripts.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  You don't see Ray Epps getting called by the Jan 6th Committee.
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  The guy running around telling everybody for days to attack the Capitol.
[53:19.000 --> 53:27.000]  You don't see any of that. You don't see him called Jaden X working for CNN and they're saying burn the Capitol now.
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  His dad's a three-star general.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't see any of that.
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.000]  Because they already know what happened that day and it was a dud.
[53:39.000 --> 53:43.000]  It was still terrible and three citizens got their heads beaten and killed and shot.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  But the police were put in the middle of it.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  The Capitol security was put in the middle of it.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  They were undermanned on purpose.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  All of Trump's requests were denied.
[53:51.000 --> 53:58.000]  Oh, but Trump's request to have the hostage rescue team was there to make sure nobody got violent or for eye control.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  But they didn't do that.
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.000]  They sat there with their sniper rifles trained on everybody.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  And they sat there in the Capitol waiting under the Capitol and in the side rooms.
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  They now admit these documents waiting to save the Democrats.
[54:10.000 --> 54:19.000]  And only lady later at night, once the sun's are going down, did they boil out of all their holes in the Capitol and around it.
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  We're there up on the top of the roof that we rented to do live coverage.
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  And we see them boiling out.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Boiling out.
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  They didn't have to be bussed in.
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.000]  They had to be driven in.
[54:30.000 --> 54:37.000]  They were all in the buildings around it and on the rooftops and everywhere.
[54:37.000 --> 54:50.000]  And they were in black uniforms with Antifa cohorts breaking down the doors to get the groups of people into the building.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  And so that's what really happened, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  And that's what really went on.
[54:53.000 --> 55:00.000]  And on the fourth hour, we're going to go over all of this with an expert who was a witness and there.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  And again, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:05.000 --> 55:11.000]  We had these organizations come visit us the morning of January 6th the hotel.
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  We had them calling us when we're on the rooftop.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  Obviously we're not stupid.
[55:17.000 --> 55:24.000]  We know like friends were calling and oh high level CIA just, you know, calling to be friendly.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  See how we're doing.
[55:25.000 --> 55:32.000]  And we're all just walked right into this trap, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:32.000 --> 55:40.000]  And they love to send us all to prison for what they did.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  And there's a lot more I haven't told you folks.
[55:42.000 --> 55:43.000]  It's bad.
[55:43.000 --> 55:44.000]  It's bad.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  And I just been waiting for this stuff to start coming out.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  And now is the right time to do this.
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  And now I'm able to get people that are real experts to talk about it.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  So that's where we are in this country.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  That's where we are in this world.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  And that's what's really going on if you want to know the truth.
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  And more importantly, like, OK, well, that was a year ago.
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  Ha ha ha.
[56:07.000 --> 56:08.000]  The feds, you know, did it.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  They got caught.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  Yeah, the Internet knows what they did.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  The general public knows what they did.
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.000]  But they're getting ready to stage bigger events to blame the populist movement.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  We put the live show headline up, please.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  Thank you.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  This is very, very important information we're going to be covering.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  Mike Adams is going to be in studio next.
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  So much huge news.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  He's got the biggest news ever.
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.000]  In fact, print his latest report, guys, about the 10 million dying a day at current projection
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  numbers within the next decade.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  He's going to be in here.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  And we also have another special guest who's a military doctor who's very well-spoken
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  and informed to elaborate on what Dr. Malone and Dr. Peter McCullough talked about here
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  on the broadcast.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  That's coming up.
[56:47.000 --> 56:56.440]  And I'm hosting the fourth hour today with our expert on what he witnessed and what actually
[56:56.440 --> 56:58.000]  happened that day and what he was told.
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.440]  Because, I mean, he knows those people because he's been in charge of a bunch of them.
[57:03.440 --> 57:07.760]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:07.760 --> 57:10.040]  And that's where this country's gone.
[57:10.040 --> 57:12.280]  And I'm just going to tell the truth.
[57:12.280 --> 57:13.280]  I need your prayers, though.
[57:13.280 --> 57:16.000]  We need your support because they're coming for us, ladies and gentlemen, because we're
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  not cowards.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  We're not going to back down.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.720]  Somebody's got to stand up to this evil and call it out.
[57:20.720 --> 57:21.720]  Not everybody's sold out.
[57:21.720 --> 57:22.720]  Not everybody's a coward.
[57:22.720 --> 57:23.720]  Not everybody's into pedophilia.
[57:23.720 --> 57:24.720]  Look at this headline.
[57:24.720 --> 57:27.240]  You guys got the live show headline for me?
[57:27.240 --> 57:29.240]  Put it up there again.
[57:29.240 --> 57:31.920]  Rumble is just Fox News on cracks as Rolling Stone.
[57:31.920 --> 57:34.800]  Well, Rolling Stone is just a bunch of pedophiles that run a magazine.
[57:34.800 --> 57:35.800]  How's that?
[57:35.800 --> 57:36.800]  How do you like that?
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.960]  The world exclusive federal commandos secretly oversaw January 6th riot document show Alex
[57:41.960 --> 57:45.720]  Jones and special guest to break new critical information on deep state false flag and
[57:45.720 --> 57:47.320]  war false flags coming.
[57:47.320 --> 57:49.880]  Stop the next false flag.
[57:49.880 --> 57:54.720]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[57:54.720 --> 57:56.720]  the globalists are doing right now.
[57:56.720 --> 57:58.440]  This is their big offensive.
[57:58.440 --> 57:59.880]  This is their takeover.
[57:59.880 --> 58:03.840]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[58:03.840 --> 58:07.880]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[58:07.880 --> 58:08.880]  in the open.
[58:08.880 --> 58:13.400]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[58:13.400 --> 58:17.680]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[58:17.680 --> 58:20.960]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[58:20.960 --> 58:23.080]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[58:23.080 --> 58:26.760]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.
[58:26.760 --> 58:29.920]  Plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock
[58:29.920 --> 58:33.920]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[58:33.920 --> 58:37.000]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers that are so good for your body.
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.680]  And if there's two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[58:40.680 --> 58:45.280]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[58:45.280 --> 58:49.120]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[58:49.120 --> 58:53.920]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[58:53.920 --> 58:55.960]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[58:55.960 --> 59:01.680]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[59:01.680 --> 59:02.680]  But we failed.
[59:02.680 --> 59:04.160]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[59:04.160 --> 59:09.920]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[59:09.920 --> 59:12.280]  deindustrialization, great reset.
[59:12.280 --> 59:16.600]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[59:16.600 --> 59:21.200]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[59:21.200 --> 59:24.480]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but
[59:24.480 --> 59:26.320]  we've also got to get personally prepared.
[59:26.320 --> 59:29.040]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[59:29.040 --> 59:34.040]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[59:34.040 --> 59:38.080]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[59:38.080 --> 59:39.720]  to ship right now.
[59:39.720 --> 59:44.640]  Make your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[59:44.640 --> 59:46.920]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[59:46.920 --> 59:48.680]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[59:48.680 --> 1:00:03.440]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:08.440]  Coming up, it's the quickening Mike Adams to break his biggest news ever with a global
[1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:14.200]  alert and estimated 10 million people mainstream media government coverups.
[1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:15.960]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:22.520]  Well, so does he live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:23.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:24.520]  That's right.
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:30.120]  Global alert and estimated 10 million people per day are set on irreversible countdown to
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:32.080]  vaccine death.
[1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:37.760]  And here is a medical care on international television talking about the numbers coming
[1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:42.360]  into the hearts and microcardias and we have deaths everywhere of celebrities, young people,
[1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:45.040]  old people, even children now dying, getting the shots.
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:47.880]  This is hellish depopulation.
[1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:53.160]  And then in the four tower world exclusive federal commandos secretly oversaw and ran
[1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:57.720]  the January 6 riot document show Alex Jones, a special guest will break new critical information
[1:00:57.720 --> 1:01:01.360]  on deep state false flags and the other big ones they're planning to bring the country
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:02.680]  into pure martial law.
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:10.120]  And first, here is Dr. Asim Malhotra talking about the heart situation and the deadly shots.
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:14.760]  Seeing this abstract publication circulation, I was concerned about it for a number of reasons.
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:18.520]  So first and foremost, we have to understand that there's been a shift in understanding
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:20.080]  of heart disease over the years.
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:24.600]  We know now it's a chronic inflammatory condition that is exacerbated by some called instant
[1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:28.960]  resistance, which talked about on the show before, which is related to poor lifestyle.
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:34.080]  Now what this abstract has shown what this research has shown is that markers associated
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:37.960]  with increasing the risk of heart attack and probably even progression of underlying heart
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:42.000]  disease and people have already got some heart disease has been significantly increased
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.760]  risk from 11% at five years risk of heart attack to 25%.
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:49.280]  Now that's a huge increase.
[1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:55.400]  If this is true, it's very concerning indeed, but in medicine, in good science, we never
[1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:56.680]  rely on one study.
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:01.240]  We need to replicate these findings. However, what I will share with you today on GB News
[1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:06.840]  is a few days ago after this was published, somebody from a very prestigious British institution,
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:11.440]  cardiology department researcher, a whistleblower, if you like, contacted me to say that the
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:17.040]  researchers in this department had found something similar within the coronary arteries linked
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:21.720]  to the vaccine, inflammation from imaging studies around the coronary arteries.
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:26.040]  And they had a meeting and these researchers at the moment have decided they're not going
[1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:32.560]  to publish their findings because they are concerned about losing research money from
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:33.960]  the drug industry.
[1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:38.840]  Now this person was very upset about it and I wanted to obviously share this on GB News
[1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:39.840]  today.
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:45.440]  What I would say is that we then knowing this information, which is very concerning, Stephen
[1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:49.040]  Gundry's paper in circulation and also anecdotal evidence.
[1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:54.000]  I mean, I have a lot of interaction with the cardiology community across the UK and anecdotally
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.840]  I've been getting told by colleagues that they are seeing younger and younger people
[1:02:57.840 --> 1:03:00.160]  coming in with heart attacks.
[1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:02.280]  Now what does this mean in terms of the data?
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:05.160]  We have to put the jigsaw for the pieces together.
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:11.960]  We know since July there's been almost 10,000 excess non-COVID deaths and most of those
[1:03:11.960 --> 1:03:15.480]  or significant proportion of those are being driven by circulatory disease, in other words
[1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:17.000]  heart attack and stroke.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.960]  There's been a 30% increase in people having a dying at home and often these are because
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:26.240]  of cardiac arrest and of course this is also something close to my heart because my own
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:28.320]  father is one of those statistics.
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:32.920]  He had a cardiac arrest at home July the 26th so when this figure, these data, since this
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:34.880]  data has been collected.
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:36.080]  So where do we go from here?
[1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:37.960]  I think the signal is quite strong.
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:43.800]  I personally think that this needs investigating so I think the Joint Committee of Vaccines
[1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:47.640]  and Immunisation should absolutely investigate this.
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:52.400]  I think that the researchers, I really hope that they take a look in the mirror and realise
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:53.400]  the ones from...
[1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:59.160]  Okay, this video was from three months ago, now the numbers are out, it's a 40% plus increase
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:02.880]  in heart attacks and strokes in the UK, they have official numbers and that's exactly what
[1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:09.280]  the big insurance company owner said, 40% increase in death of 18 to 64 year olds and we've got
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:14.280]  so much more with Mike Adams coming up after this break.
[1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:19.360]  He is in studio with us and he has been travelling around the country, his show has always been
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:23.920]  big but it's really exploded, I just see the powerful interviews he does all over the country
[1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:28.040]  with amazing people so I know he's a private guy that likes to be at his farm but he's
[1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:33.520]  been on the offense across the country and he's got a global alert, an estimated 10 million
[1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:41.800]  people per day are set on an irreversible countdown to vaccine death that could exterminate
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:43.880]  billions if not stop in the next year.
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:48.800]  We'll explain all this and more straight ahead and remember all the people working for the
[1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:58.800]  system taking the shot, they're planning to kill you too, we'll be right back.
[1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:04.680]  Christmas 2021 is over but you've still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:09.120]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year while at the same time
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:14.080]  making yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.

[1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:40.160]  changer, the missing link, not just for immune system but all electrochemical activity in
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:43.280]  the body, it's back in stock 50% off.
[1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:48.640]  So that's the new year special and that's Christmas comes early in 2022 ladies and gentlemen,
[1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:54.960]  give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarstore.com

[1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:16.920]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report, if you are receiving this transmission,
[1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:17.920]  you are the resistance.
[1:06:17.920 --> 1:06:28.920]  The government is up, because you can stand as long, and all of it has been paused by
[1:06:28.920 --> 1:06:36.280]  there being inflation in the country and oil, prices going up roughly 40%, we've seen a
[1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:40.320]  doubling of gas prices here in the United States and you can see the unrest coming as well,
[1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:44.960]  that's why they want to get it all primed for racial, not going up against the globalist
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:48.840]  and the private central banks, but priming you that when there is an angrier world as
[1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:53.320]  Claus Schwab says, you just kill each other, we just kill each other, instead of realizing
[1:06:53.320 --> 1:06:56.400]  it's the globalist literally killing us.
[1:06:56.400 --> 1:07:01.400]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is also a software and computer engineer and also owns one of
[1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:08.160]  the largest testing facilities for food and medicines in Texas, and of course he's a
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:14.640]  prolific writer and researcher, he doesn't need any introduction, and he has got every
[1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:18.200]  few months something bigger than he's ever broken because there's a quickening, the news
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:21.840]  is more intense, that's the way it is, and I would say, he didn't say this, this is
[1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:26.240]  the biggest report he's ever put out, we've also posted it at infowars.com in the live
[1:07:26.240 --> 1:07:33.400]  show link section, global alert, an estimated 10 million people per day are set on irreversible
[1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:38.880]  countdown to vaccine death that could exterminate billions if not stop the next year, now let
[1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:44.520]  me just back up some of what Mike's saying here before he gets into it, I just showed
[1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:49.640]  you a massive global insurance company saying in western countries we're seeing a 40% increase
[1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:56.400]  in death five times bigger than any increase we've ever seen in the hundreds of years that
[1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:02.680]  they've been keeping actuarial numbers, okay, so that is a fact, okay, here's some of the
[1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:08.720]  other anecdotals, 25 year old soccer star suddenly collapses, dies during training, Brazilian
[1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:13.560]  journalist 30 something years old collapses and has five heart attacks from his third
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:21.800]  covid shot, Australian Prime Minister threatens to deport world champion tennis player if
[1:08:21.800 --> 1:08:27.080]  his vaccine exemption is quote insufficient, it's better than dying, Pfizer trial data
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:33.960]  shows jab causes severe fever in one out of five children, New York teacher injecting
[1:08:33.960 --> 1:08:38.360]  a child without parental consent, I mean, this is a cult folks of control, Quebec to
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:42.760]  ban unvaccinated from buying marijuana and hard liquor, they really want you to take
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:47.880]  that shot folks, Manhattan's woke DA will stop seeking prison sentences though for most
[1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:53.120]  crimes including robbery, it goes on and on, French President Macron admits his strategy
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:58.520]  is to piss off the unvaccinated as much as possible, this is all psychological torture,
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:04.200]  it's all control, so Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is here for the rest of the hour to lay out
[1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:08.360]  his incredibly important report that has all the statistics, all the numbers and he's
[1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:12.240]  just taking what the insurance companies and what governments are admitting and what they're
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:17.400]  showing and then extrapolating it out because now we're a year into this operation, almost
[1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:21.760]  a year and a half in the UK so we're getting very hard numbers now, real science, but they
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:25.160]  don't want you to look at, they just use the term science, science like a parrot, hoping
[1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:28.040]  you don't actually go look at the science, Mike Adams, thanks for being here.
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:32.440]  Well thank you Alex for having me on again, it's great to be back in studio with you after
[1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:39.000]  quite a while that I wasn't here, if you look at the numbers that are emerging, it's now
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:44.960]  crystal clear that we have less time remaining than what we thought and this explains why
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:48.880]  Biden and the other vaccine pushers around the world, they don't care about the legal
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:52.280]  challenges because they know they can tie this up in the courts for several years.
[1:09:52.280 --> 1:09:57.320]  What I'm going to present here today explains we have less than a year remaining or we lose
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:04.080]  human civilization, this is an extinction level event that if we don't stop these vaccines
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:08.880]  it will play out over the next decade to bring down civilization as we know it.
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:14.560]  That's why Dr. Robert Malone calls this a mass casualty event that we are living through
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:20.080]  right now and Mike Eden, former VP of Pfizer, even saying essentially this is mass murder,
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:25.320]  we have to stop this but here are the statistics, if you go to ourworldandata.org and you look
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:30.200]  at the number of vaccines being given per day, it's about 30 million per day around
[1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:35.240]  the world, now based on the numbers from the life insurance companies, the myocarditis,
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:41.160]  the autoimmune disorders, the autopsies published by Dr. Bhakti and Burkhart and others, we've
[1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:45.000]  been able to estimate now based on these new data and by the way, remember the life insurance
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  data is from the third quarter of last year, it's going to look a lot worse than a 40%
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.120]  increase by the time we get the fourth quarter data from last year, when we put all this
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:58.320]  together we can see we're going to have, of those who are vaccinated, about one third
[1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:04.480]  will die over the next decade or so, another third will be debilitated, injured, and perhaps
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:10.760]  not capable of functioning in society in a meaningful way, the final third will be unharmed
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:16.760]  perhaps because they receive saline solution shots, so we're looking at right now, Alex
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:21.080]  if we stop the vaccines right now, we're going to lose about 1.4 billion people around the
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:27.000]  world over the next decade and I'm literally having an anxiety attack right now because
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:36.160]  these numbers are in, these are real numbers, they did it, look, let me explain this, 30
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:43.040]  million shots a day, 10 million of those 30 million per day will die over the next decade
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:48.800]  or so based on what we know now, again these are projections, they are subject to some
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:52.840]  level of change, and I'll tell you what I'm going to say Mike and I want you to continue,
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:57.120]  it's bad enough that they're killing all these people, now they're doing it to children, but
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:11:59.920]  they're going to do something huge after this, they're not going to leave those of us that
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:03.680]  didn't take it alone, this means total war.
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:09.200]  Well, I'm going to get to that, you're exactly right, but look, 10 million people per day
[1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:17.760]  folks, that means there is a Nazi level Holocaust mass death event happening, start over when
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:22.160]  I interrupted that, if you have the numbers on the current extrapolation, when do we reach
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:28.320]  the 10 million a day point, they're doing it right now, every day it's 10 million people
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:34.160]  who will die over the next decade, every day, so what they're pulling off is a Nazi level
[1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:41.760]  Holocaust every 14.4 hours, Alex, they're carrying out a Holocaust every 14.4 hours,
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:47.480]  a soft kill, I mean it's here, they always said they do it with shots, right, so understand
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:55.360]  people, understand that if we don't stop these vaccines in the next 365 days, they will
[1:12:55.360 --> 1:13:01.840]  murder another three and a half billion human beings, and combined with the roughly coming
[1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:06.920]  up on 1.5 billion that they've already condemned to death, that's going to be over 50% of the
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:12.800]  population on planet earth, this is an extinction level event if we don't stop it.
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:17.960]  And now you know what Prince Charles, his father said he wants to come back as a deadly
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:23.400]  virus, 30% of the world said this is a military mobilization to make you take shots to save
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:28.080]  the earth, so they're being very honest about what they're actually doing, I mean they are
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:32.920]  quote saving the earth by giving people soft kill weapons, that as your family members
[1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:36.960]  get sick and die, they'll then suck all the money and energy out of you and your generational
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:39.400]  wealth while they kill you.
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:46.160]  Well, exactly, and understand that they cannot allow this event to be blamed on vaccines,
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:51.080]  blamed on their policies, so this means that as you have predicted numerous times Alex,
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:56.200]  they're going to have to unleash some other global killer event in order to cover their
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:14:03.040]  tracks, so yes, something epic, something biblical is coming, something satanic is coming,
[1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:04.040]  I should say.
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:07.120]  That's right, that's right, I mean as a father every instinct I've got is to go to the most
[1:14:07.120 --> 1:14:10.520]  remote area now and hunker down, guarantee this is going down folks, but we're going
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:14.480]  to stay at the ship to warn as many people as we can, as long as we can, but don't people
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:18.840]  understand we're not hyping this, you are living through biblical times.
[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:25.800]  And understand that it's too late to save already 1.5 billion people, it's too late,
[1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:29.720]  because we don't know how, there's no way to reverse the damage, if you look at the
[1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:35.680]  autopsies that Dr. Bakhti and Burkhardt, they published their paper on 93% of people who
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:40.360]  died after receiving vaccines were killed by the vaccines.
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:45.240]  So if you look at the daily deaths in America right now, 7,700 people die every day normally
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:50.440]  pre-COVID, you start to look at the fact that we're going to have multiples of that dying
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:56.080]  each day, in 2022 dying from cancer, dying from neurological disorders, dying from heart
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:15:00.520]  attacks, organ destruction because of the killer lymphocytes, we're going to see multiples
[1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:02.840]  of the normal death rate per day.
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:06.360]  And we're hearing that from coroners around the world, pathologists, we're hearing it
[1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:11.160]  from undertakers, we're hearing it from the big labs around the world, including the U.S.,
[1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:14.160]  that do biopsies and they go, we're seeing 20-fold increases in cancer.
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:15.160]  That's right.
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:16.160]  That's right.
[1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:19.960]  And I mean, just a three-fold increase in the daily death rate would put us at about
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:28.080]  24,000 deaths per day in America, 24,000 deaths per day, you start to get into percentages
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:30.160]  of the existing U.S. population.
[1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:33.200]  And Mike, I think today is the day I'm going to talk about some personal family stuff for
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:34.200]  our owners.
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:35.200]  People need to hear this.
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:38.000]  But just how bad this is, you know, you heard about the North and the South, the war, brother
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.160]  against brother, father against, you know, brother, all of it.
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:44.520]  We're going to talk about it all today, but I interrupted.
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:45.520]  That was too important.
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:48.760]  You said, when we come back, please repeat everything you said without me interrupting
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:51.320]  because this is the most important information we've ever covered.
[1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:53.560]  I want this to really sink in for people.
[1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:54.560]  It's done.
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:57.800]  They already killed us.
[1:15:57.800 --> 1:16:02.680]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[1:16:02.680 --> 1:16:04.640]  the globalists are doing right now.
[1:16:04.640 --> 1:16:06.360]  This is their big offensive.
[1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:07.800]  This is their takeover.
[1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:11.760]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:12.880]  Now they're a world government.
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:14.360]  They're permanent martial law.
[1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:16.760]  Their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:21.320]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:25.600]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:28.880]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:31.000]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.

[1:17:56.400 --> 1:18:01.400]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:18:01.400 --> 1:18:05.800]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:10.880]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:13.440]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:16.800]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:18.200]  but really they're just a commune.
[1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:21.240]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it.
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:24.320]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over, so I actually buy this from the
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:25.320]  Mexican rebels.
[1:18:25.320 --> 1:18:27.840]  And I've been buying it for, what, 14 years, and the price has never gone up.
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:32.200]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, for a pound.
[1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:34.720]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:38.200]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:41.200]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:43.200]  Yeah, I'd like that.
[1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:46.200]  Okay, you want to believe it.
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:50.880]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:57.360]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:00.200]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:04.600]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:10.480]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:14.160]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:19.120]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:23.240]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:27.520]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:30.200]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.
[1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:37.520]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in America products that have 100% reviews
[1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:38.520]  and are simply incredible.

[1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:47.720]  against the globalist, a true 360 win.
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:58.960]  Get your Faraday cages at infowarstore.com, check out the new line, it's amazing.
[1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:23.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:28.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mike Adams is here of naturalnews.com, Alex Jones with infowars.com,
[1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:33.200]  and I know you understand this, but we don't make stuff up.
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:39.520]  We get things wrong occasionally, and usually we underestimate how bad something is.
[1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:45.280]  And we know historically when populations get hit by something really incredibly evil,
[1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:49.200]  they at first don't figure out it's happening because evil doesn't come back the same way
[1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:51.520]  each time, it'll hit you from other angles.
[1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:57.640]  But this is a modern deindustrialization, depopulation collapse event in their own words.
[1:20:57.640 --> 1:21:04.880]  And that's why Dr. Rima Labo on record treated the heads of state, including Hillary Clinton
[1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:09.720]  and including Angela Merkel and also the Queen of the Netherlands.
[1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:14.360]  Now in confidence, I'm not allowed to say who told them what, but she told me the names.
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:18.320]  And I made some checks and actually found some open source data where this person actually
[1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:20.000]  made the comment publicly.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:23.640]  But she was treating a head of state, and then the woman said the mass calling is coming
[1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:24.960]  the next three years.
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:27.120]  They put it off, but now it's here.
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:32.200]  That's how you watch that clip from 2009, and it's like it all happened today, because
[1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:35.000]  their husband was the former head of the Army.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Okay?
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.560]  General Stubblebine, a three-star general, ran special operations, everything.
[1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:41.920]  So he came on the show and talked about this too.
[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:44.640]  So they thought it was going to happen, then they ran down to Costa Rica.
[1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:48.240]  I'm going to hand this over to Mike Adams, recap what you said earlier about the global
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:50.280]  alert, start over without me interrupting.
[1:21:50.280 --> 1:21:51.800]  Well, okay.
[1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:55.040]  And by the way, I've got about a one-minute clip I brought, gave it to your producers
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:22:00.600]  to show at some point here, because I was interviewing your talent, Harrison, Harrison
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:06.320]  Smith the other day, and he was saying that he used to listen to me.
[1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:09.960]  And he was like, I was kind of the person who helped wake him up in addition to you
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:10.960]  and your information.
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:14.640]  I was like, Harrison, I mean, Alex is the person that woke me up.
[1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:21.720]  And this clip shows a speech I gave in 2019, before COVID, where we're talking about the
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:26.320]  exotic alien biological weapons that are about to be unleashed against humanity.
[1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:31.480]  So I want to give you credit for all the work that you've done and let you know that your
[1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:37.760]  knowledge and what you're doing here at InfoWars really influenced me with my research.
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:40.160]  And I hope at some point today we can play that.
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:42.640]  But let's play it right now then, and then next time you can recap.
[1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:43.640]  Go ahead, guys.
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:46.120]  But here it is.
[1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:52.280]  So here's the most likely hard kill vector that could be coming, an exotic alien engineered
[1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:57.880]  biological weapon that specifically targets human DNA.
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:02.600]  And you might think, well, they would never do that.
[1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:03.600]  Guess what?
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:04.600]  DARPA has been doing it.
[1:23:04.600 --> 1:23:06.920]  It's called Gene Drive Technology.
[1:23:06.920 --> 1:23:13.280]  They've been working on it, and it's a CRISPR gene editing technology and it enables genetic
[1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:16.540]  modifications to spread very rapidly through a population.
[1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:20.200]  They also have something called RNA interference technology, where they can genetically engineer
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:24.280]  food crops so that there are little protein fragments in the crops, and the protein fragments
[1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:27.560]  can target fertility of specific human races.
[1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:29.480]  And this is called an insecticide.
[1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:30.480]  They use it.
[1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:34.560]  They've been developing this so that they can kill certain insects that feed on certain
[1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:35.560]  crops.
[1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:36.960]  They can also do it to humans.
[1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:41.720]  RNA interference technology, it exists.
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:45.080]  Psychic weapon of mass destruction may not be far away.
[1:23:45.080 --> 1:23:49.000]  Bioengineered Ebola is a strong candidate for this.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:53.920]  It's being developed, funded by the NIH, I'm sorry, funded by the TMT.
[1:23:53.920 --> 1:24:02.160]  The NIH funded a different experiment in Guatemala that used Guatemalan prisoners as human subjects.
[1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:07.720]  In fact, when that came out during the Obama administration, Obama himself had to apologize
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:08.720]  because they got caught.
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:10.480]  So it's not just the mercury in the vaccines.
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:13.520]  It's not just the lead that's going to be falling out of the sky.
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:14.520]  It's the infant formula.
[1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:16.960]  It's the aluminum, which causes Alzheimer's and dementia.
[1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:18.600]  It's the organophosphates.
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:20.720]  It's the 5G networks.
[1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:26.000]  It's the assault on your senses, the assault on your neurology, the assault on your children.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.880]  These are multiple kill vectors.
[1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:34.080]  And this is what we are being hit with right now.
[1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:35.280]  I had not seen that clip.
[1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:36.680]  I've read your article saying that.
[1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:41.680]  It's months before they released the bioweapon, you specifically hit the protein prion crystals
[1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:42.680]  in the food.
[1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:46.040]  You specifically hit that it's alien because it's never existed before.
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:47.320]  This is alien.
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:50.360]  And I do believe, I don't do that extrapolation.
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:52.520]  I can just go the next step.
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:54.560]  This whole attack isn't human.
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:56.080]  You're exactly right.
[1:24:56.080 --> 1:24:58.640]  And that's why this is an extinction level event.
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:03.640]  So what I talked about at that event, which was Steve Quayle's event, by the way, in Branson,
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:09.200]  Missouri in 2019, was that Earth is being prepared for a post-human future.
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:12.440]  Now, at the time, that sounded pretty far out.
[1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:13.840]  And they say that everywhere, though.
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:18.160]  Now, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, after COVID, oh, the end of humanity, looking
[1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:19.160]  forward to it.
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:20.160]  Exactly.
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:21.160]  Exactly.
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:25.160]  So you have to ask what we're seeing right now with the kill rates.
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:30.760]  And by the way, big thumbs up to Dr. Peter McCullough and Dr. Robert Malone and Steve
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:33.880]  Kirsch and all these amazing people who have come out.
[1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:37.480]  However, there's only so far that they can talk about.
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:38.480]  Well, that's right.
[1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:41.760]  Behind the scenes, they agree with what you just said.
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:44.600]  And you saw Malone say it's interdimensional.
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:45.600]  Absolutely.
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:46.600]  Yeah.
[1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:47.600]  He said it was interdimensional.
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:48.600]  He said it was interdimensional.
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:49.600]  Exactly.
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:50.600]  Because, folks, there's not just bad guys.
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:51.600]  There is God.
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:53.160]  There's another transmission.
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:59.080]  There are non-terrestrial entities, which some people may call demons or demonic influence,
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:05.400]  demonic possession, and other things that do not want humanity to survive.
[1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:07.440]  And that's what we're being subjected to.
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:14.040]  So this is so many levels beyond just making money for Pfizer or reducing population by
[1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:16.160]  10% to 15% as Bill Gates wanted.
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:21.480]  This is about exterminating humanity to prepare planet Earth for a post-human future.
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:25.960]  They've decided they don't want the human race to exist in the cosmos.
[1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:29.440]  They've decided that we're a failure while they put chemicals in the food and water that
[1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:30.960]  make us fat and ugly.
[1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:34.320]  While they screw us over, while they put us in a trance, then they look at us and make
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:36.800]  fun of us and say, look how weak you are.
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:37.800]  Exactly.
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:42.120]  And even cosmically, the vaccine is, I call it a cosmic IQ test.
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:48.120]  It's a test to see, is this species on this planet dumb enough to line up and commit suicide?
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:50.080]  Are they dumb enough to allow their own species?
[1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:51.080]  Exactly.
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:55.920]  You see the free will rule of God's universe and this galaxy in that the rules are always
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:26:56.920]  there.
[1:26:56.920 --> 1:27:02.000]  They have to give us a choice because they're not allowed to do this unless we free will
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  do it.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  Right, right.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:07.920]  They set up a test that humanity is failing hugely right now.
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:13.320]  And by the way, I think one of the things that energetically attracted this ethnic cleansing
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:15.920]  of our planet is all of the baby murder.
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:16.920]  Oh, I agree.
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:17.920]  So, I mean-
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:20.160]  Well, that's why the Satanists do it, is to bring that energy in.
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:21.160]  Exactly right.
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:22.480]  It's like chumming the water.
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:24.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  It's like copper tops.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.980]  It's like turning human babies into a dark energy source upon which they feed in order
[1:27:29.980 --> 1:27:33.040]  to accomplish the complete wipeout of human civilization.
[1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:34.040]  And folks-
[1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:36.000]  Because there's no greater energy than a baby in the sea of the universe.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  The beauty, the goodness, the potential.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  That's right.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  That's right.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:41.360]  Like wheatgrass is the potential of the seed.
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:43.200]  This is a trillion times more powerful.
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:49.160]  And remember that as the baby's brain is physically forming in the body of the mother, the brain
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:57.800]  is making spiritual connections to consciousness, which is a non-physical, non-material existence
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:27:58.800]  of free will.
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:27:59.800]  Interimensally opening gates.
[1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:00.800]  Exactly.
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:06.000]  And that is God's gift to give the baby consciousness and free will, which becomes creativity, which
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.800]  becomes essentially the Bill of Rights.
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:10.440]  Why do we have the First Amendment?
[1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:11.560]  Why do we have the freedom to speak?
[1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:15.760]  Because we are conscious free will beings given the gift of consciousness from God.
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:18.760]  And that's what's so beautiful, Mike, is that I've even talked about this privately,
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:23.040]  but I would imagine you and others, everybody is advancing their knowledge right now.
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:27.240]  For those against this evil, it's like the doors of perception are being blown wide open.
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:28.240]  That's exactly what's going on.
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:29.740]  That's exactly the case.
[1:28:29.740 --> 1:28:30.740]  Are we going to break?
[1:28:30.740 --> 1:28:31.740]  We're going to break.
[1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:32.740]  We're going to come back.
[1:28:32.740 --> 1:28:33.740]  Longer segment coming up.
[1:28:33.740 --> 1:28:34.740]  I want you to recap.
[1:28:34.740 --> 1:28:35.740]  This is all incredible.
[1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:36.740]  Okay.
[1:28:36.740 --> 1:28:37.740]  And you've got to come back more often.
[1:28:37.740 --> 1:28:38.740]  I'm happy to do that, Alex.
[1:28:38.740 --> 1:28:39.740]  Yeah.
[1:28:39.740 --> 1:28:40.740]  We're on fire.
[1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:41.740]  I'm good Lord.
[1:28:41.740 --> 1:28:44.240]  We're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, because, hey, as negative as this is, they're
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:46.240]  not killing us because we're weak and ugly and bad.
[1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:49.240]  They're killing us because we're super powerful.
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:50.240]  Well, they're right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:51.240]  By the way, they're going to lose.
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:52.240]  Well, they're right back.
[1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:55.240]  One, two, three, go.
[1:28:55.240 --> 1:29:03.840]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you've still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:08.480]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time, making
[1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:13.240]  yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.

[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:47.800]  So that's the new year special, and that's Christmas comes early in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.

[1:29:53.280 --> 1:29:56.600]  50% off for a limited time.
[1:29:56.600 --> 1:29:58.200]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[1:29:58.200 --> 1:30:03.080]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[1:30:03.080 --> 1:30:05.040]  the globalists are doing right now.
[1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:06.760]  This is their big offensive.
[1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:08.200]  This is their takeover.
[1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:12.160]  And this is the point that they're very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:16.200]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:17.200]  in the open.
[1:30:17.200 --> 1:30:21.720]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:25.960]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[1:30:25.960 --> 1:30:29.240]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:33.920]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:34.920]  you keep us on air.
[1:30:34.920 --> 1:30:38.600]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:42.240]  50% off, X2, and Winter Sun.

[1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:49.000]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:53.640]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[1:30:53.640 --> 1:30:58.400]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:03.440]  Ultimate Bone Roth is back and better than ever, and 20% off, plus free shipping and double
[1:31:03.440 --> 1:31:05.600]  Patriot points for our new sale.
[1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:08.960]  After years of being off the shelves, we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite
[1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:12.680]  formulas ever, and it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[1:31:12.680 --> 1:31:15.240]  It's Ultimate Bone Roth Plus.
[1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:20.400]  It's got concentrated high quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing,
[1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:25.800]  chaga musher, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, then it's got added magnesium
[1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:27.880]  and potassium for electrolytes.
[1:31:27.880 --> 1:31:33.880]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea
[1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:35.880]  salt.
[1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:38.080]  It even tastes better than the last formula, and what it does for your body is it's simply
[1:31:38.080 --> 1:31:39.080]  amazing.
[1:31:39.080 --> 1:31:44.640]  Again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder for better flavor
[1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:45.640]  and dissolvability.
[1:31:45.640 --> 1:31:49.280]  You're going to love this, and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body,
[1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:53.160]  what it does for your bones, it's simply amazing, and it helps funding infowar.

[1:31:57.640 --> 1:32:02.080]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:03.440]  I like going to concerts.
[1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:04.800]  I like going to play golf.
[1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:06.200]  I like going out to dinner.
[1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:08.240]  I like the metropolitan life.
[1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:13.800]  I like everything that comes with this, but see, I have the survival instinct that is
[1:32:13.800 --> 1:32:19.640]  to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas,
[1:32:19.640 --> 1:32:22.720]  because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[1:32:22.720 --> 1:32:26.320]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in
[1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:29.880]  the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the
[1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:30.880]  land?
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:31.880]  That's the survival instinct.
[1:32:31.880 --> 1:32:36.760]  See, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no.
[1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:37.760]  Stay in the city.
[1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:41.000]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:42.800]  need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[1:32:42.800 --> 1:32:48.320]  That's the internal struggle that, my guess is, a lot of you in the audience are facing
[1:32:48.320 --> 1:32:49.320]  as well.
[1:32:49.320 --> 1:32:54.000]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies, and so
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:59.360]  we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[1:32:59.360 --> 1:33:16.080]  Leading of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:22.480]  Leading of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:22.480 --> 1:33:29.800]  You are living in the most incredible time in human history right now, I'm Alex Jones,
[1:33:29.800 --> 1:33:31.280]  your host, Mike Adams of Natural News is here.
[1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:33.240]  He's going off the public numbers.
[1:33:33.240 --> 1:33:35.040]  They're now admitted.
[1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:40.960]  And remember, the latest numbers are a few months old, so it's trending straight up.
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:44.480]  Recap everything you talked about in that first segment, because I was interrupting
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:45.480]  Mike Adams.
[1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:50.440]  Go over people listening and watching right now and encourage them to go to naturalnews.com,
[1:33:50.440 --> 1:33:52.240]  encourage them to go to infowars.com.
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:55.480]  You can also repost the article, whatever you do, just get it out.
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:34:00.520]  Global Alert, an estimated 10 million people per day are set on an irreversible countdown
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:05.680]  to vaccine death that could exterminate billions if not stopped in the next year.
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:07.960]  And they'll go, oh wait, there's not billions dead.
[1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:14.000]  If you follow the number of the death rate on the course it is, we're talking about billions
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.680]  dead, but it's already millions and millions of vaccine damaged, hundreds of thousands
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:20.120]  dead in the U.S. alone.
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:24.600]  These are mainline numbers, and they're just normalizing all this and saying the robots
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:26.600]  will soon take over.
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:27.600]  Society is failing.
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:31.120]  You will need robots, says the head of Pfizer, says the head of the Davos Group.
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:32.120]  This is their plan.
[1:34:32.120 --> 1:34:33.120]  Mike Adams, continue.
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:38.560]  Yes, these are forward-looking statements based on the data that we have now.
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:42.920]  But the fact that's irrefutable is that about 30 million people per day are being injected
[1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:44.920]  with these COVID vaccines.
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:46.080]  That's irrefutable.
[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:50.880]  We know that about half the world's population has been injected, and we also know that with
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:54.920]  each additional injection, there is further destruction of the immune system.
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:58.720]  The VE numbers, vaccine effectiveness rates, are going into negative territory after a
[1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:02.480]  certain amount of time, a certain number of weeks after the injections.
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:07.160]  We also know that countries like Israel and I think Denmark and others are pushing more
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:08.600]  than four shots.
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:10.920]  They're going to five or six shots at some point.
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:14.400]  And I believe Fauci just said in the U.S., you're not fully vaccinated until you've had
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:17.560]  at least one booster, and that's going to obviously increase.
[1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:24.160]  So when we look at these numbers, and we can project out over the next decade or so, for
[1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:29.200]  example, myocarditis has a 56% fatality rate within five years.
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:33.600]  How many people are being diagnosed with myocarditis after being injected with these vaccines?
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:35.160]  That's a huge number right there.
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:41.840]  And then how many diagnoses are being missed because they are subclinical levels of myocarditis.
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:47.040]  But also looking at the Dr. Bhakti, autopsies, what percentage of people who took the vaccines
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:52.640]  are now growing lymphocyte nodes on their organs and having killer lymphocytes attack
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:57.920]  their hearts, their lungs, their livers, their brains, and other tissues in the body?
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:04.840]  The autopsies showed 93% of the people who got the vaccines are growing these immune
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:09.640]  system responses that are essentially autoimmune disorders where the body attacks itself.
[1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:13.120]  That doesn't even get into antibody-dependent enhancement.
[1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:16.520]  That doesn't even get into the cognitive decline that's happening.
[1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:22.120]  So conservatively, one-third of the people who took these vaccines are going to be dead
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:24.800]  in the next decade, and it might be a lot faster, Alex.
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:26.960]  It could be in fewer years than 10.
[1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:29.040]  Well, I have a family member.
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:30.040]  I'll tell you later.
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:31.040]  Go ahead.
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:34.840]  Well, then the big question becomes, we live in a complex society, folks.
[1:36:34.840 --> 1:36:38.320]  There is a knowledge base of people who know how to run the nuclear power plants, know
[1:36:38.320 --> 1:36:42.320]  how to run the water plants, the sewage plants, who know how to run telecommunications and
[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:44.280]  everything to keep the power grid going.
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:48.560]  The vaccine is not just wiping out human life and achieving depopulation.
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:55.260]  The vaccine is deleting the human knowledge base that is required to keep society running
[1:36:55.260 --> 1:36:57.640]  and pass a certain tipping point.
[1:36:57.640 --> 1:37:02.560]  Once a critical mass of die-offs is achieved, we can no longer run a complex society that's
[1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:05.440]  necessary to provide the food, the water, the electricity, and everything else.
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:08.800]  And they're openly all over the world getting rid of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and
[1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:12.600]  then introducing all forms of mental illness, where I saw an article of the day where the
[1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:19.360]  media saw a bunch of beach umbrellas, and they said, oh, it's a KKK meeting, because
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:20.640]  it's like mental illness.
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:22.920]  They see the racism thing everywhere.
[1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:23.920]  Meanwhile, they're being slaughtered.
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:25.160]  They're being spied on.
[1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:29.480]  They're losing all their freedoms, but just recap the numbers that you went over earlier.
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:34.880]  Well, again, per day, 10 million people are being set on a path of vaccine death right
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:35.880]  now.
[1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:37.360]  That's happening as we speak.
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:43.240]  So in the next 14.4 hours, there will be another Holocaust-level die-off event that
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:45.360]  takes place over the next several years.
[1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:46.680]  Now, it's important to understand.
[1:37:46.680 --> 1:37:50.400]  They're not dying today, because vaccines kill people in three phases.
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:53.080]  There are short-term deaths, medium-term, and then long-term.
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:55.400]  The short-term is the smallest of that.
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:00.120]  That's the people who pass out and die from instant strokes and heart attacks and so on,
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:02.080]  and blood clotting within minutes.
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:05.120]  That's a very small number compared to where this is going.
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:08.200]  The medium-term and long-term is where you have the cancer deaths.
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:12.000]  Don't forget, Alex, I know you covered this, but the spike protein enters the cell nuclei
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.200]  and it suppresses the chromosomal repair mechanism.
[1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:21.000]  They're called double-strand breaks, which is when ionization, basically you lose genetic
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.520]  integrity and you start becoming a mutant.
[1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:29.840]  So because the spike protein suppresses what's called the NHEJ mechanism, nonhomologous end
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:30.840]  joining.
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:34.520]  Bottom line, this is a fabulous weapon they created.
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:35.520]  It's the ultimate...
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:38.560]  Well, it's like I said in that clip from 2019.
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:41.320]  It's an exotic alien bioengineered...
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:44.080]  Attack on the DNA itself, which is a repairing system.
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:45.480]  Exactly.
[1:38:45.480 --> 1:38:47.800]  This was not simply...
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:49.000]  It didn't just come out of a lab.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:50.600]  It wasn't just to make money.
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:56.680]  This came from somewhere else, and then it was incorporated and refined and targeted
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:57.680]  to human beings.
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:01.000]  So, yes, the NIH funded gain of function research, but what did they use?
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  It's the perfect weapon.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:05.560]  It kills you 100 different ways over a long period of time.
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:06.880]  It's a soft-kill weapon.
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:08.480]  It's the perfect weapon.
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:15.240]  And so the bottom line, Alex, is it's very likely that within the next five years, almost
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:19.600]  everything that we talk about is going to be irrelevant because there will not be a functioning
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:21.360]  society as we know it today.
[1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:26.280]  And they say we're collapsing civilization to be post-industrial, but robots run it.
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:27.280]  It's the opposite.
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:32.000]  The new Matrix movie is suddenly the robots are good and the Matrix is good and the Matrix
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  saves you.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  Right, right.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  It's sick.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:41.160]  Now, we can perhaps stop the total collapse of civilization if we stop the vaccines now
[1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:44.200]  or in the next couple of months or weeks.
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:47.240]  That's why I have this sense of urgency, because I can look at the numbers like you can.
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:49.920]  If this is a turnaround soon, there's no coming back.
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.400]  There's no coming back.
[1:39:51.400 --> 1:39:56.360]  And there's a theory out there that the Omicron strain was perhaps developed by White Haps
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.640]  and White Hat scientists, excuse me, in a lab and then released to try to nullify the
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:07.680]  Delta strain, kind of a self-spreading vaccine antibody against the pandemic.
[1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:09.240]  I don't know what to make of that theory.
[1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:10.240]  Against the spike protein.
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:11.240]  Right, right.
[1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:15.800]  But maybe, maybe that's happening and maybe that's going to save us, but I wouldn't count
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:16.800]  on it.
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:17.800]  I don't think that's the case.
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:22.120]  We have to stop the vaccines, otherwise we lose civilization.
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:24.000]  That's the truth.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:27.080]  When you look at Klaus Schwab and all of them, I mean, it's on record.
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:30.720]  We reported this 15 years ago, but now it's confirmed all the big money is hiding out
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:35.080]  in the woods in remote areas around the world, digging in like it seemed to the world.
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:38.560]  And I know a lot of famous people that are at the highest levels and they go, yeah, you're
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:39.560]  right, Alex.
[1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:42.840]  All these billionaires I know just basically hide out in the middle of nowhere now.
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:49.440]  Well, we get calls from billionaires who want to buy out half our inventory, for example.
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:52.280]  And I know you guys probably get similar calls.
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:55.000]  I can't even get inventory.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  This is a problem.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Right.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:01.040]  And we know they're going underground too.
[1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:04.760]  I mean, Zuckerberg building a massive underground complex in Hawaii.
[1:41:04.760 --> 1:41:08.680]  We know that, yeah, Peter Thiel is involved in this.
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:11.680]  We know Elon Musk, you know, is drilling underground here in Texas.
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:12.840]  We're not saying people are bad to build bunkers.
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:13.840]  That's smart.
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:19.280]  That's actually smart because the surface of the planet is going to be total chaos.
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:24.760]  And like you said, the lunacy mass formation psychosis combined with the psychotropic drugs
[1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:27.320]  combined with starvation, famine and desperation.
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:30.120]  That's what's coming on the surface of the earth.
[1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:35.280]  And you know, I saw a little TikTok video of someone who works for a corporation just
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:40.880]  been ordered to wear a mask on all TikTok videos because other employees are triggered
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:43.280]  by seeing people's faces without masks.
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:44.280]  Exactly.
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:45.760]  Now racism is the human face.
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:47.640]  Think of how that's an inversion of reality.
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:48.640]  Exactly.
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:49.640]  This is beautiful and wonderful.
[1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:50.640]  No, no, no.
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:51.640]  It's triggering people.
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:52.640]  Right.
[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:53.640]  So now.
[1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:54.640]  I saw that conform.
[1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:55.640]  You saw that.
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:41:56.640]  I mean, it's, it's total insanity.
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:41:57.640]  Absolutely true.
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:41:58.640]  In their Zoom meetings, remember?
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:41:59.640]  It was like in Wisconsin.
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:02.640]  The teacher association was making employees wear masks on the interviews.
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:03.640]  Well, right.
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:08.080]  And, and think about, you know, fake president Biden in his fake Oval Office soundstage set
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:11.960]  with, you know, fake snow falling in the fake windows in the background wearing a mask.
[1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:15.960]  What do we always hear about with Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Charles and all of them
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:16.960]  and Hillary?
[1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:18.160]  Do not look them in the eyes.
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:19.600]  Well, let's pass that.
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:20.600]  Cover your dirty face.
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:21.600]  Yeah.
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:22.600]  Yeah.
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:25.760]  They want us to be robots, not showing that face because this spirit hates us so much as
[1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:29.400]  like the Bible tells us, because we're made the image of the creator and this thing doesn't
[1:42:29.400 --> 1:42:31.880]  like us because it's lost a bunch of wars with us.
[1:42:31.880 --> 1:42:34.200]  And as soon as we figure that out, it's all game over.
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:36.480]  Well, that you're exactly right.
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:40.720]  The awakening, we still have time to win and defeat this evil, but we're running out of
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:41.720]  time.
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:42.720]  We don't have a year, Alex.
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:43.720]  We don't have a year.
[1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:44.720]  Exactly.
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:45.720]  Folks.
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:46.720]  We're just one settlement.
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:47.720]  Okay.
[1:42:47.720 --> 1:42:49.720]  And they're trying to blow our settlement up.
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:51.720]  We got to come together as humans and beat this thing.
[1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:52.720]  Okay.
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:55.720]  Mike Adams is our guest today with us.
[1:42:55.720 --> 1:43:01.600]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in M4's live products.
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:05.200]  And that's why for more than two years, we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:08.720]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:12.160]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients.
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:14.760]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:18.600]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:19.920]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:24.960]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:29.880]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:34.480]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:37.880]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium
[1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:38.880]  added.
[1:43:38.880 --> 1:43:41.080]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:45.520]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:46.520]  of sea salt.
[1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:47.520]  And it just goes on and on.
[1:43:47.520 --> 1:43:53.320]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off and free shipping
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:57.600]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:02.320]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in-game blueprint for global
[1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:03.320]  enslavement.
[1:44:03.320 --> 1:44:08.600]  And in that documentary, I predicted the globalist would establish world government by releasing
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:14.080]  a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:16.000]  our industrial society.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  And now they've done it.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.040]  How did I know they would do it?
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:23.480]  Because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal
[1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:24.480]  meetings were leaked.
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:29.680]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group, who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab.
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:34.040]  And our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:35.040]  this great reset.
[1:44:35.040 --> 1:44:36.880]  Well, we're now living in it.
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:40.920]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world, none attached to the
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:46.200]  tyrannical corporate world government, the total censorship, no due process, destruction
[1:44:46.200 --> 1:44:51.120]  of the family, and then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison mass
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:54.640]  creating these vaccines to poison us in the populace.
[1:44:54.640 --> 1:44:56.120]  This is what info wars is fighting.
[1:44:56.120 --> 1:45:00.200]  We're fighting for the future.
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:06.320]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:07.320]  the world.
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:09.800]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:11.320]  They know you're angry.
[1:45:11.320 --> 1:45:15.600]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:16.600]  we've got.
[1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:20.840]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:01.200]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:02.200]  Welcome.
[1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:03.200]  Hello, Alex.
[1:46:03.200 --> 1:46:04.200]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:05.200]  All right.
[1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:07.200]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:12.080]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:14.840]  Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[1:46:14.840 --> 1:46:17.520]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:19.400]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:24.360]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:29.920]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:30.920]  but just aren't as strong.
[1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:32.920]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:35.320]  In fact, each batch is different.
[1:46:35.320 --> 1:46:37.320]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[1:46:37.320 --> 1:46:40.840]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:41.840]  That's just how it is.
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:43.360]  It's how it works.
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:44.960]  So it's always good.
[1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:47.120]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:51.280]  Yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:21.360]  We have another very special guest joining us in studio.
[1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:22.760]  He's a medical doctor.
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:24.280]  He works for the military.
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:25.920]  He has a lot of great perspective.
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:27.800]  Look forward to having him in studio.
[1:47:27.800 --> 1:47:33.040]  And then we're going to talk to somebody that was there on the ground with me on January
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:37.080]  6th, who knew a lot of the feds that were there.
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:40.480]  And we've already basically talked about this, but now it's breaking out.
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:41.480]  It's mainstream news.
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:43.560]  Now it's in court documents.
[1:47:43.560 --> 1:47:48.200]  One of the secret commandos was shoot to kill authority were at the Capitol, thousands
[1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:56.160]  of them, and they stood down and their comrades were in the crowd helping provocateur the
[1:47:56.160 --> 1:47:57.160]  whole thing.
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:47:58.160]  An incredible setup.
[1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:03.040]  And then they were going to kill the people that were going to try to, quote, kidnap Pelosi
[1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:04.040]  and others.
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:07.600]  They believe they were under Q command, which of course was not Trump, but was the very FBI
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  deep state.
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:12.000]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, we've got this segment, a short segment and our next guest
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  is coming in.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:14.680]  And I really appreciate you got to come back sooner.
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:18.160]  But what else do you want to just add about this epic moment we're in?
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:21.320]  I mean, I think it's people better research your article.
[1:48:21.320 --> 1:48:22.320]  They better share it.
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:27.160]  They better bookmark it and they better warn people and go protest at the places kids are
[1:48:27.160 --> 1:48:30.760]  being injected, whatever you got to do to try to save lives.
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:33.000]  Because you can say, well, let the idiots just kill themselves.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  Well, what about their children?
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  They don't deserve it.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:39.240]  But also the societal collapse event, which Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates admit they're
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:42.120]  engaged in, this is going to destroy confidence in the government.
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:43.480]  This is going to destroy confidence and everything.
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:46.880]  We have to explain who did it and how the globalists did it, pretending they're this
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:50.480]  new super species of transcendence who are playing God.
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:53.800]  If we don't get who the good guys and bad guys are, they will win.
[1:48:53.800 --> 1:48:56.520]  So I think it really is about the narratives here.
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:48:58.160]  And so how would you boil that down?
[1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:02.760]  Well, understand that the globalists, if they achieve this mass die off, they're going to
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:04.960]  reshape history.
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:08.720]  They will write you and I and others out of the history books.
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:14.000]  We will cease to exist because they will tell a whole new narrative after the great reset.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.960]  Now understand the great reset is not just about a financial reset, although that's part
[1:49:17.960 --> 1:49:18.960]  of it.
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:22.160]  It's also about resetting the human knowledge base through the die off that I mentioned in
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:23.500]  the last segment.
[1:49:23.500 --> 1:49:27.600]  So they know if they can delete the memories of where we are, who we are, where we came
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:32.360]  from and what's happening, then they can reshape the narrative as they see fit, just like in
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:36.760]  George Orwell's 1984, where the Ministry of Truth is constantly going back in time and
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:41.860]  rewriting the encyclopedia entries and the news stories in order to fit the current narrative.
[1:49:41.860 --> 1:49:49.160]  So what's critical in all of this is that everybody take every episode here at InfoWars
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:55.960]  and download it, write it to your hard drives, put it on thumb drives, burn it to optical
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:50:02.440]  media such as DVDRs and share it and hand it out because this is going to be the contraband
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:03.440]  in the next decade.
[1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:05.480]  The contraband is the truth.
[1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:10.160]  You're going to be living in a society where it will be illegal to possess information
[1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:13.560]  that goes against the prevailing narrative.
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:18.320]  And one other thought on all this, Alex, is that if we don't stop these vaccines in the
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:21.640]  next year, we will still survive.
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:25.480]  We will still live for a few more years, but at that point it's like being on an airplane
[1:50:25.480 --> 1:50:30.080]  at 30,000 feet and the plane has lost power and the pilots are dead.
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:33.400]  You're coasting now, but you're going to hit terrain.
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:34.760]  You're going into the ground.
[1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:36.560]  And that's just going to be a few years out.
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:39.720]  And there's nothing you can do to stop it at that point, even though you're not dead yet.
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:43.640]  And how do you balance that as your mission to warn people puts you up front as a target
[1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:44.640]  just like it does me?
[1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:48.840]  And then I have constant guilt, like guilt if I don't fight this, but then guilt just
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:52.360]  greedily to protect my family and just go off the radar.
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:56.200]  But I think the best thing is just do the right thing, trust in God and expose the agenda.
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:50:57.200]  That's our best hope.
[1:50:57.200 --> 1:50:58.560]  Well, it's very difficult to balance this.
[1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:00.600]  I think I'm out of balance as well.
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:06.480]  I spend more time warning other people than prepping myself, but the best advice I have
[1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:10.760]  for people on prepping is to think about low tech prepping.
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:16.360]  So we're going to collapse down to more of an 18th century type of existence in many
[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:17.360]  areas.
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:18.360]  Right.
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:19.360]  Don't expect power or like, oh, I'm on gas.
[1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:20.360]  That's right.
[1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:21.360]  The gas ain't coming.
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:23.440]  So you have to have layers of redundancy in your prepping.
[1:51:23.440 --> 1:51:27.360]  So yeah, on one hand, you might have a high tech security system with cameras and alarms
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:28.360]  and everything.
[1:51:28.360 --> 1:51:33.560]  But you need low tech system and you need dogs who bark when intruders come.
[1:51:33.560 --> 1:51:38.480]  You know, you need low tech prepping systems and a firearm is very low tech.
[1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:39.600]  It doesn't need electronics.
[1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:41.000]  It doesn't work in the cloud.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  Thank God.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  Right.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:44.720]  You pull the trigger and physics takes over.
[1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:49.120]  So we need to think about low tech prepping and then local redundancy, which means food
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:50.680]  systems as well.
[1:51:50.680 --> 1:51:55.200]  And so producing food is going a lot of, we're going to see a collapse of centralization.
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:59.240]  This is one of the big trends of the next 10 years, and we're going to see things collapse
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:05.880]  down to the local level with a relocalization of food production, energy production, security
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:08.600]  with local law enforcement and community enforcement and so on.
[1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:10.640]  And let's remember, they all know they're collapsing things.
[1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:13.680]  They're going to pose as a savers during it claiming they're coming in to help their
[1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:14.680]  local community.
[1:52:14.680 --> 1:52:16.560]  They're going to be there to sabotage stuff.
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:20.320]  The first thing is shut off their agenda 2030, let people know they're the ones that are
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:21.480]  collapsing it.
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:26.040]  Once it collapses, they're going to send their operatives in as sociologists to control us.
[1:52:26.040 --> 1:52:29.280]  People will listen to you now, but they're going to listen later when the operatives
[1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:30.280]  arrive.
[1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:31.280]  Yeah.
[1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:32.280]  You're exactly right.
[1:52:32.280 --> 1:52:34.320]  And we're also going to have to learn how to live in a society where we don't have any
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:36.160]  exports from China.
[1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:42.120]  So that right there takes out almost all computers, electronics, car parts, the things that run
[1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:43.120]  the power grid.
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:44.960]  And it's not this or the money is going to be worthless.
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:46.120]  You're not going to be able to get stuff.
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:47.120]  You got to get it now.
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:48.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:51.600]  And you know, in DC and with the Federal Reserve, they're going to try to print their way out
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:54.200]  of product shortages and logistics failures.
[1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:56.280]  You can't print corn, okay?
[1:52:56.280 --> 1:53:01.400]  You can't print plastic parts or metal parts that run the turbines of the airplanes or
[1:53:01.400 --> 1:53:02.600]  the hydroelectric dams.
[1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:04.800]  You can't print that stuff by printing money.
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:07.960]  The physical shortage, as you just said, is what's going to do us in.
[1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:10.880]  And this is why society is going to collapse back to agrarian day.
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:14.360]  And they're attacking our intellectual, our mathematical, our spiritual, our cultural
[1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:15.360]  capital.
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:17.360]  That's real capital, not money, folks.
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:21.160]  And all of that is being shrunk down to weaken us as a species.
[1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:24.280]  And again, if you extrapolate that out, there's no way the globalists get out of this without
[1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:29.160]  nuclear meltdowns, the service of the earth becoming unlivable, and every actuary that's
[1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:30.480]  been done even by the Pentagon.
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:35.600]  So why are they following a path that will cause mass war, mass starvation, and nuclear
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:36.600]  meltdowns?
[1:53:36.600 --> 1:53:40.640]  Because it's a planetary ending event, not just for us, but all major species.
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:41.640]  It is.
[1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:44.480]  It's a full-blown, as I call it, oblivion agenda.
[1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:49.160]  It's an agenda to exterminate planet Earth, or most humans on planet Earth.
[1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:50.160]  But there will be survivors.
[1:53:50.160 --> 1:53:51.560]  Don't get me wrong.
[1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:55.840]  The question is whether the survivors, whether we have enough of the infrastructure remaining
[1:53:55.840 --> 1:53:56.840]  to the function.
[1:53:56.840 --> 1:53:57.840]  Exactly.
[1:53:57.840 --> 1:54:00.280]  Once civilization gets so complex, it's so easy to collapse.
[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:01.280]  Exactly.
[1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:02.280]  Exactly.
[1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:03.600]  It's very easy to overrun and control at that point.
[1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:09.800]  So our job is to simply survive, to encourage other people to survive.
[1:54:09.800 --> 1:54:13.640]  And by the way, the future of children on planet Earth is pure bloods.
[1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:18.920]  And by the way, women right now who are vaccinated are lying, I've heard, they're lying when
[1:54:18.920 --> 1:54:20.080]  they're on the dating scene.
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:23.360]  They're telling men they're not vaccinated because they don't want men to know that they're
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:24.520]  infertile.
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:27.920]  Because the vaccines have made them infertile in there.
[1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:32.200]  And let's expand on that, because if you're a military brain and you study history, everything
[1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:33.480]  is like aliens are attacking.
[1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:36.440]  I don't get into flying saucers, any of that, or lizard people, folks.
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:40.400]  I'm saying, if you mathematically, as just a person, look at the attack, it's what's
[1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:43.360]  our primary power source for 5,000 years coal?
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:44.360]  They're outlawing it.
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:46.360]  They're shutting down the infrastructure and then blowing it up.
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:50.800]  If you notice, they don't just shut down the coal plants, they then scrap them and go as
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:54.120]  a symbol being against it, we're sealing and blowing the mine.
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:58.440]  They're killing the infrastructure to go back to it for this collapse event.
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:00.800]  This is what you would do when you're turning the lights out.
[1:55:00.800 --> 1:55:04.600]  Your second enemy does is primary target is the generators.
[1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:06.440]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[1:55:06.440 --> 1:55:10.320]  Look how Europe shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany.
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:12.360]  They're there in an energy crisis in Europe.
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:14.640]  They shut down our pipeline.
[1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:15.640]  Well, exactly.
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:16.640]  Exactly.
[1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:17.640]  And remember, as I've covered before.
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:18.640]  That's the thing.
[1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:19.640]  No matter what country you are, it's the same attack, folks.
[1:55:19.640 --> 1:55:22.720]  It's not the Russians and the Chinese, the Americans against each other.
[1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:24.040]  It's the New World Order against you.
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:25.040]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:26.040]  No, it's okay.
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:29.000]  But because of the shutdown of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons then, and I've talked about
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:30.440]  this on your show.
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:31.440]  It's terraforming.
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:35.080]  It's not only is it terraforming, but remember the fertilizer production.
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:41.080]  To make ammonia and make urea, you use hydrocarbons from fossil fuels through the harbor process
[1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:42.320]  chemical equation.
[1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:43.960]  Using nitrogen from the atmosphere.
[1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:48.000]  So when you shut that down, what we're going to see, Alex, over the next couple of years
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:51.840]  is massive crop shortages, scarcity and failure due to a lack of fertilizer.
[1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:55.280]  Well, you said that a year and a half ago and now it's happening in Europe.
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:55:56.280]  It's happening in Europe.
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:55:59.280]  The Europeans are going to have to choose now for the rest of the winter between them.
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:00.280]  I told you, Mike, you're finally doing it.
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:04.000]  I said, Mike, everything you said comes true just like I do, even better.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:05.840]  That's what goes viral in Warren's people.
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:08.000]  You've got to start mining all the stuff you've said.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.720]  And I never even saw that incredible clip we played earlier in the hour.
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:12.520]  Well, I had kind of forgotten about that.
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:13.520]  You know what you're talking about.
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:15.720]  Well, we know what we're talking about.
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:20.240]  I mean, you know, that clip from you and I back in 2010, we were talking about vaccine
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:22.000]  passports and quarantine centers.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:25.640]  I mean, 12 years ago, forced inoculation or race, the immune system.
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:30.280]  So like, Mike, we've got another guest coming in and you probably got to go, but he'll be
[1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:32.240]  with me a little bit into that next hour.
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:33.240]  Why don't you co-host with us?
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:34.240]  Got a little bit with me.
[1:56:34.240 --> 1:56:35.240]  Sure.
[1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:36.240]  I'm happy to do that.
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:37.240]  All right.
[1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:39.240]  We're going to have three people in here the first 20 minutes and then I'll interview
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:40.840]  the doc for the rest of that.
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:45.720]  And then we got Joey coming on and Joey's willing to say who he is and do everything.
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:48.280]  But I mean, you hear about these guys in the military and then I want to really say, I
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:50.720]  mean, like this guy's done it all and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:54.320]  And that's why he on January 5th was like, hey, Jones, this is a setup, something bad.
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:56.320]  You got to like your CIA running around.
[1:56:56.320 --> 1:56:57.320]  There's everybody here.
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:56:58.320]  We got to watch out.
[1:56:58.320 --> 1:57:03.200]  And then now, now that it's out, you can talk about this because this isn't classified.
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:07.120]  So now we can tell you stuff that we weren't able to tell you before because, you know,
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:10.320]  these guys know this stuff and the financial security letters, they can't talk about it
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:11.320]  until it's public.
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:12.320]  This is a bombshell.
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:13.320]  This is bombshell.
[1:57:13.320 --> 1:57:14.320]  Yeah.
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:16.120]  I should have listened to him and I'll be honest.
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:19.760]  You know, I'm like eating steaks and okay, yeah, we're going to a big rally expose the
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:20.760]  election fraud.
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:24.600]  He's like, listen, there's a setup here and I didn't listen.
[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:25.600]  And here we are.
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:27.240]  Well, now it's coming out.
[1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:32.640]  I mean, you talk about it saying, Mike Adams, our guest, I've not plugged one time today
[1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:36.800]  and that's fine because we're covering such artwork stuff at infowarstore.com, X2, the
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:41.440]  best iodide out there, 50% off, bottom mineral fusion is selling out, 50% off, that keeps
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:42.440]  us on air.
[1:57:42.440 --> 1:57:47.520]  And you need it though for you and your families to stock up.
[1:57:47.520 --> 1:57:52.400]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:54.400]  the globalists are doing right now.
[1:57:54.400 --> 1:57:56.120]  This is their big offensive.
[1:57:56.120 --> 1:57:57.520]  This is their takeover.
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:01.520]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:05.560]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical charity is out
[1:58:05.560 --> 1:58:06.560]  in the open.
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:11.040]  Their charity population agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:15.280]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:18.560]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:20.560]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:24.280]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.
[1:58:24.280 --> 1:58:27.200]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in
[1:58:27.200 --> 1:58:31.560]  stock, 50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[1:58:31.560 --> 1:58:35.160]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers that are so good for your body and if there's
[1:58:35.160 --> 1:58:38.360]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[1:58:38.360 --> 1:58:43.000]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off and it keeps us on the air.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:45.360]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[1:58:45.360 --> 1:58:51.320]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:55.600]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:59:00.760]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:59:00.760 --> 1:59:03.320]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:59:03.320 --> 1:59:06.760]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[1:59:06.760 --> 1:59:08.080]  but really they're just a commune.
[1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:11.120]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[1:59:11.120 --> 1:59:13.320]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[1:59:13.320 --> 1:59:16.520]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[1:59:16.520 --> 1:59:17.680]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:22.080]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[1:59:22.080 --> 1:59:24.560]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:59:24.560 --> 1:59:28.080]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[1:59:28.080 --> 1:59:35.680]  Um, in fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, um, we had like the, you wouldn't believe
[1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:36.680]  it.
[1:59:36.680 --> 1:59:40.680]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:59:40.680 --> 2:00:01.520]  And if you don't find us, you don't want to say, that's fine, leading a frontal assault
[2:00:01.520 --> 2:00:11.640]  on the whole country.
[2:00:11.640 --> 2:00:16.800]  All right, Mike Adams riding shotgun weather stop for Peter Chambers is an amazing guy,
[2:00:16.800 --> 2:00:19.200]  according to all the military folks I've talked to.
[2:00:19.200 --> 2:00:20.880]  I've seen a few of his videos.
[2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:23.880]  He's going to be joining us right shotgun next hour.
[2:00:23.880 --> 2:00:30.880]  And then we've got the big enchilada on how they're playing the stage terror attacks to
[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:35.280]  demonize the populist movement in America and bring in full bore martial law.
[2:00:35.280 --> 2:00:38.400]  That's coming up in the fourth hour today.
[2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:41.480]  But Mike Adams, you've said a lot in the last hour to an incredible job and this should
[2:00:41.480 --> 2:00:42.880]  all short five minute segment.
[2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:46.600]  What other key tidbits do you want to impart to people?
[2:00:46.600 --> 2:00:51.560]  Well there, there is a possibility that there are nutritional defenses that can save the
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:55.160]  lives of people who have taken only the first two shots.
[2:00:55.160 --> 2:01:00.280]  So there is some hope for those who have awakened and come to their senses as long as you stop
[2:01:00.280 --> 2:01:02.240]  taking the shots now.
[2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:05.040]  There's always more research coming out.
[2:01:05.040 --> 2:01:11.080]  So you know, we've seen research happening, diphenhydramine combined with lactoferrin.
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:14.960]  That's by the way, you know, benadryl basically combined with lactoferrin, which is a breast
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:15.960]  milk protein.
[2:01:15.960 --> 2:01:16.960]  What is flow voxamese?
[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:17.960]  I'm not for antidepressants.
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:19.200]  That shows how powerful they are.
[2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:20.880]  How could something like that block it?
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:22.760]  Well, I don't know the mechanism of that.
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:28.240]  But what's interesting is there are drug candidates that that are existing FDA prescribed drugs
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:32.560]  and even over-the-counter drugs like benadryl that I mentioned, and when they do the modeling,
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:36.360]  they realize that a lot of these can block the ACE2 receptor sites, for example.
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:41.400]  Some of them block the replication of the spike protein virus, you know, the SARS-CoV-2
[2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:42.400]  virus.
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:44.840]  But I'm telling you, the answers are out there, folks.
[2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:46.320]  It's just that it's all being suppressed.
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:47.320]  And we know it's a great infection.
[2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:49.440]  A lot of medical doctors don't even want to say it on air because they'll lose their
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:50.440]  license.
[2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:55.600]  They're like, no, you should probably cycle on and off of hydroxychloroquine or cycle
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:58.400]  on and off of things like ivermectin.
[2:01:58.400 --> 2:01:59.400]  Ivermectin.
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:00.400]  Yeah.
[2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:01.400]  Yeah.
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:02.840]  Well, there's no doubt ivermectin is saving a lot of lives right now.
[2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:06.480]  So really, the globalists have failed to shut that down because of the efforts of people
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:07.480]  like Dr. Zelenko.
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:09.000]  Which shows if we fight back, we win.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:14.160]  So, but understand that you have to protect the quality of your blood.
[2:02:14.160 --> 2:02:18.120]  And the quality of your blood depends on obviously what you're eating and drinking.
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:20.000]  So proper hydration is critical.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:26.920]  But also, I'm a fan of using fish oils and EPA and DHA as oils in order to allow your
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:28.120]  blood to flow more easily.
[2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:32.280]  I mean, some people take a daily aspirin to deal with that.
[2:02:32.280 --> 2:02:33.840]  They've done that for many years.
[2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:35.560]  And check with your doctor.
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:36.560]  Make sure it's all good.
[2:02:36.560 --> 2:02:38.920]  What is the mechanism of the aspirin when we know what the fish hole does?
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:41.480]  But what's aspirin do?
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:43.360]  Well, it's a blood thinner.
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:45.080]  So it just thins the blood.
[2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:49.480]  But I tend to tell people, hey, if your blood is sludgy, as we say.
[2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:53.480]  If it's pumping and it's too thick and too viscous, then a vaccine could be the tipping
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:56.480]  point that takes you over the edge and causes the clots.
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:02:59.920]  So if you already have high blood pressure, the vaccine is what can kill you.
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:03.880]  So you need to get back to your lifestyle and realize what's causing the high blood
[2:03:03.880 --> 2:03:04.880]  pressure, right?
[2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:08.360]  It comes down, you know, diet and exercise, nutrition, supplements and all these things
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:10.200]  that we all know.
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:14.880]  But I mean, even myself, I find it hard to find time to exercise like I used to right
[2:03:14.880 --> 2:03:17.280]  now because of what we're dealing with as well.
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:22.560]  So a lot of us, we end up spending more time prepping or warning others and somewhat neglecting
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:23.560]  our own physical health.
[2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:24.560]  Well, that's my point.
[2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:26.560]  Just because I'm preaching something doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:28.840]  Well, yeah, I'm the same boat.
[2:03:28.840 --> 2:03:33.760]  I mean, you know, I'm probably like 15, 20 pounds heavier than I was two years ago.
[2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:37.560]  I'm a lot better prepped, but I'm not in as good physical shape.
[2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:39.680]  I know I can get back to it as you can as well.
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:40.680]  We can get back to it.
[2:03:40.680 --> 2:03:43.000]  But this is the critical moment for humanity.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.360]  We need to warn people, warn people, warn people.
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:47.060]  We can't survive alone.
[2:03:47.060 --> 2:03:51.800]  We have to have a, you know, a population, a critical mass of living people.
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:55.440]  Elon Musk's money is not going to be worth anything anywhere if things collapse.
[2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:59.120]  Even all the gold in the world, Alex, you know, I know a lot of billionaires too, and
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:00.400]  they've got gold and silver.
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:03.800]  It's going to be useless if you don't have a society that's functioning.
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:08.480]  So anybody out there that if you've got a lot of money out there and you've got a bunker
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:12.840]  and you're prepped and you've got, you know, a giant room full of silver is a better investment
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:14.200]  is stopping the collapse.
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:16.000]  You got to help us spread the word.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  That's the thing.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:20.240]  Stop the vaccines and then we have a chance to fight back and then we can spend the next
[2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:24.680]  two years doing research on how to save the lives of those who were vaccinated.
[2:04:24.680 --> 2:04:25.680]  I totally agree.
[2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:31.080]  I'm going to play a excerpt of a Pentagon CIA expert on how the propaganda they're using
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:32.800]  against us is illegal.
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:37.320]  They wouldn't even use this propaganda when we talk about mass psychosis formation against
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:40.640]  Al Qaeda and against the Taliban, but they use it against us.
[2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:45.760]  That's coming up inside the military secret undercover army and the same group that helped
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:49.080]  the feds launch the attack on the Capitol to frame us.
[2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:53.720]  That's coming up, ladies and gentlemen, with Mike Adams and so much more and Dr. Peter

[2:05:57.160 --> 2:05:59.480]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[2:05:59.480 --> 2:06:04.360]  On lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:11.960]  It started out as a psychological operational tactic developed by the U.S. military to use
[2:06:11.960 --> 2:06:15.000]  against terrorist organizations abroad.
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:19.800]  It appears to have ended up as a Democrat Party strategy to defeat President Trump in
[2:06:19.800 --> 2:06:21.360]  the 2020 election.
[2:06:21.360 --> 2:06:27.240]  Dr. J. Michael Waller is a defense expert and was the first to spot it.
[2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:30.920]  What is defeat disinfo?
[2:06:30.920 --> 2:06:39.280]  Defeat disinfo was an entity run in the spring and summer of 2020 by military people, former
[2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:45.320]  military people, supportive of Joe Biden, and it was designed to enhance a disinformation
[2:06:45.320 --> 2:06:49.880]  narrative about Russian collusion and all these other things that have been disproven.
[2:06:49.880 --> 2:06:56.680]  But they were using their military prestige to make their own disinformation seem like
[2:06:56.680 --> 2:06:59.920]  it was anti-disinformation.
[2:06:59.920 --> 2:07:06.840]  Using their own disinformation to wrap in a cloak of this is anti-disinformation.
[2:07:06.840 --> 2:07:12.760]  Right, to confuse the public, to get people angry, to make people fearful, to energize
[2:07:12.760 --> 2:07:18.800]  a base for Biden that really wasn't there because he was so bland and out of touch that
[2:07:18.800 --> 2:07:20.960]  there was very little enthusiasm.
[2:07:20.960 --> 2:07:27.080]  So it was a psychological warfare operation aimed at the American public by former military
[2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:34.680]  officers who had been involved in counterinsurgency to treat the American public as an insurgency
[2:07:34.680 --> 2:07:38.800]  and to squash it as one would squash an insurgency.
[2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:43.640]  Dr. Waller would know because he helped develop these techniques to be used against America's
[2:07:43.640 --> 2:07:45.440]  enemies abroad.
[2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:51.320]  As a civilian I was involved in helping prepare elements of what became a counterinsurgency
[2:07:51.320 --> 2:07:55.080]  manual issued by the military under Nagel.
[2:07:55.080 --> 2:08:00.200]  Most of my parts were removed, they related to psychological warfare and using psychological
[2:08:00.200 --> 2:08:03.320]  warfare to a more robust way against the enemy.
[2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:08.880]  Well, Nagel didn't use that in the Army manual, but he did use it in 2020 against the American
[2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:09.880]  public.
[2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:15.680]  John Nagel is a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel and a leading expert on military counterinsurgency
[2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:16.680]  tactics.
[2:08:16.680 --> 2:08:20.680]  And these are guys who know how to use that.
[2:08:20.680 --> 2:08:26.320]  Sure, former General Stanley McChrystal was on the board of one of the firm that was manufacturing
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:27.800]  this.
[2:08:27.800 --> 2:08:31.720]  John Nagel, former Lieutenant Colonel and another former Lieutenant Colonel of his
[2:08:31.720 --> 2:08:35.640]  name Yingling, seemed to be the architects of it.
[2:08:35.640 --> 2:08:42.520]  Now, the people who designed the counterinsurgency manual against Al Qaeda and the Taliban were
[2:08:42.520 --> 2:08:49.160]  the ones who came out in 2020 to weaponize these types of technologies and techniques
[2:08:49.160 --> 2:08:51.960]  against people who supported President Trump.
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:57.080]  According to Waller, the retired military officers created a sophisticated computer
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:03.800]  algorithm that tracked pro-Trump messages on social media and paid influencers to counter
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:07.560]  those messages with anti-Trump propaganda.
[2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:09.400]  But that's not all they did.
[2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:16.680]  Two Lieutenant Colonel's Nagel and Yingling, they wrote a letter and made it public, but
[2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:21.560]  it was aimed at the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Millie.
[2:09:21.560 --> 2:09:22.560]  Right?
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:30.200]  Yes, this letter showed some type of an internal network of former military officers and what
[2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:36.520]  one presumes were still active-duty military officers to literally remove President Trump
[2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:37.520]  from office.
[2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:41.080]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much again for joining us.
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:47.480]  We are now into the third hour here today, and Dr. Peter Chambers is here with us.
[2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:53.040]  I'm going to go over his whole bio, but he's an Army doctor serving as an infantryman.
[2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:58.360]  He served in the active duty, the Army Reserves, Army National Guard for a total of 38 years,
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:01.360]  honorable discharge, and he's still, I guess, in the Guard.
[2:10:01.360 --> 2:10:07.000]  And I'm going to go over his whole bio here because I'll mess it up, but fullspectrumamerican.com.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.720]  I love that website, and I love your dog.
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:13.480]  We ought to put you on the other side here so people can see the dog, but it's great
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:16.960]  to have you here and you're a medical doctor and you wanted to get into as a flight surgeon
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:24.120]  so much more what you witnessed and just add to and augment what Dr. Malone and Dr. Peter
[2:10:24.120 --> 2:10:26.360]  McCullough and others have talked about.
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:30.080]  Also the COVID mission in Texas, he was the liaison of the governor's office.
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:34.440]  He was at the center of it all for Governor Abbott, and, of course, number two, a border
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:38.200]  mission knows everything about what's happening on the border with human trafficking, et cetera.
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:41.800]  Number three, the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan, and just everything that's happening
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:45.880]  in Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is riding shotgun with us, so great to have you, brother.
[2:10:45.880 --> 2:10:47.280]  It's good to be here.
[2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:48.280]  Thank you.
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:51.040]  So where do you want to start with all this craziness going on?
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:54.440]  First of all, because I'm in the guard, even though I'm not on orders, disclaimer, these
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:59.160]  are my opinions and mine only, not the DOD, not the Texas military department.
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:00.160]  Respect them both.
[2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:01.880]  Served them for a long time.
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:02.880]  Start with that.
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:03.880]  Absolutely.
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:04.880]  All right.
[2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:05.880]  So let's start with the dog.
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:06.880]  Give him up on the table.
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:07.880]  So Joe, come here.
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:08.880]  Come here.
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:09.880]  We can get up there.
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:10.880]  I don't care if he scratches it.
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:11.880]  Come on.
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:12.880]  Here.
[2:11:12.880 --> 2:11:13.880]  Joe, up.
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:14.880]  Come here, buddy.
[2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:15.880]  He's covered.
[2:11:15.880 --> 2:11:16.880]  Yeah, those are neat.
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:17.880]  We call them Dutchies.
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:18.880]  I see a lot of those in the military.
[2:11:18.880 --> 2:11:19.880]  A lot of people think they're Belgians.
[2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:20.880]  They look.
[2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:21.880]  You want to put them in your lap?
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:22.880]  Just pick them up.
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:23.880]  Joe, come here.
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:24.880]  Come here.
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:25.880]  There we go.
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:26.880]  There we go.
[2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:27.880]  I'll block.
[2:11:27.880 --> 2:11:28.880]  All right.
[2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:29.880]  Off legging.
[2:11:29.880 --> 2:11:30.880]  Off legging.
[2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:31.880]  Down.
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:32.880]  No, no.
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:33.880]  Nine, nine, nine.
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:34.880]  Okay.
[2:11:34.880 --> 2:11:35.880]  Good shape.
[2:11:35.880 --> 2:11:36.880]  There we go.
[2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:37.880]  We got him fired up.
[2:11:37.880 --> 2:11:38.880]  He's excited.
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:39.880]  He's excited.
[2:11:39.880 --> 2:11:40.880]  All right, Joe, rest.
[2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:41.880]  But yeah, Joe goes everywhere with me.
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:44.880]  He's a fundraiser in Houston now working with a pack down there.
[2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:48.880]  I pack met some great Texans speaking the truth.
[2:11:48.880 --> 2:11:50.880]  Tell them what's going on on the border.
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:55.240]  Of course, staying free from the Opset stuff, but let them know when these candidates who
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:57.880]  I held their feet to the fire and I looked at them, the guys that were coming in.
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:02.080]  Hey, look, when you get up on the hill, don't stab this in the back.
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:05.720]  We can talk about a little bit of that later when I talk about my whistleblowers and things
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:06.720]  like that.
[2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:07.720]  We'll go wherever you want.
[2:12:07.720 --> 2:12:10.880]  But what do you just make of the tyranny and everything we see unfolding right now?
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:18.640]  Tyranny, I see a DNA flaw in people and I spent a lot of time on the hill.
[2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:22.440]  I've briefed everybody from the speaker of the house all the way down to generals to
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:27.120]  my privates and what I've seen is a flaw in the DNA.
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:28.880]  I see an elitist type of flaw.
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:33.440]  I don't know that the government, the federal government is capable of organizing anything
[2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:34.600]  except for the military.
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:38.080]  That's the only thing that works in my opinion, my whole opinion.
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:42.720]  They can do diplomacy and things like that.
[2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:48.520]  But what I'm seeing is there's a flaw in that ilk, that club that we just can't get
[2:12:48.520 --> 2:12:49.520]  into.
[2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:50.520]  Exactly.
[2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:53.040]  They want power and control and act like they're really confident, but they can't wipe their
[2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:55.560]  ass.
[2:12:55.560 --> 2:12:57.560]  You could say that.
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:12:58.560]  They can't do that.
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:01.440]  You're seeing a sabotage of civilization.
[2:13:01.440 --> 2:13:05.600]  Would it be a sabotage if that's a pre-planned thing?
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:07.680]  I think that there are people that have that mindset.
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:08.680]  I do.
[2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:09.680]  I do believe that.
[2:13:09.680 --> 2:13:15.480]  Well, Doc, get into it as a military doctor because you're used on all this stuff.
[2:13:15.480 --> 2:13:16.480]  Okay.
[2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:19.080]  So we'll start with my fight on the COVID thing.
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:23.800]  And I'm going to say that I'm going to preface that with, in 2020, I came back from Mission
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:24.800]  Downrange.
[2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:29.480]  I was in Africa with the special operations community and literally got back, came back
[2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:36.280]  through Dulles, came back to Texas, and they said, hey, Doc, we got this virus.
[2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:37.920]  It looks like it could be Ebola.
[2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:38.920]  All right.
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:40.520]  What do I need to do?
[2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:42.280]  We need to be a liaison because you're a doctor.
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:46.600]  We could put you in the governor's office in his task force at the state operations center.
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:47.600]  Absolutely.
[2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:48.600]  I'll get down there.
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:51.880]  So I'm studying about it and I'm learning and we're looking at curves and we're looking
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:56.480]  at profiles of these different studies that are coming out telling us that 10 million
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:13:59.520]  people are going to die in Texas in the next six months.
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:01.200]  It's the first thing we saw.
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:05.120]  Then we started noticing the truth and I started calling doctors.
[2:14:05.120 --> 2:14:08.480]  When you send a recon team out, they go out and they look at what's on the ground and
[2:14:08.480 --> 2:14:10.080]  the commander makes a decision.
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:14.160]  He's got his intel guys working and the intel guys will give him a lot of paperwork like
[2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:17.960]  this right here and say, sir, this is what I think, but the recon guys are going to tell
[2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:18.960]  you what's going on.
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:19.960]  So I call ERs.
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:20.960]  I'm an ER doctor.
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:23.120]  I say, what are we seeing?
[2:14:23.120 --> 2:14:27.320]  I go back to the governor's office and I talk to the doctors with the public health and
[2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:30.840]  they basically threw me out of there and said, you can't talk about hydroxychloroquine.
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:32.200]  You can't talk about ivermectin.
[2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:37.000]  This was in March 29, 2020, when I recommended, we should probably start doing that.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:40.720]  So I should have said up front, big whistleblower on how inside government now that he tried
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:42.280]  to suppress therapeutics.
[2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:43.280]  Absolutely.
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:44.280]  Oh, yeah.
[2:14:44.280 --> 2:14:50.600]  The reason why I asked one of the public health people, the number two, why can't we talk
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:52.200]  about what Trump talked about that?
[2:14:52.200 --> 2:14:53.720]  So I'm a doctor.
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:54.720]  We can talk about therapeutics.
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:55.720]  We can talk about neutral.
[2:14:55.720 --> 2:14:57.600]  So Trump says the sky's blue.
[2:14:57.600 --> 2:14:58.600]  We're not supposed to say that.
[2:14:58.600 --> 2:14:59.600]  Affirmative.
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:00.600]  Right.
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:01.600]  It's the T word.
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:03.080]  We can talk about the T word at that time.
[2:15:03.080 --> 2:15:04.800]  Now me, I'm a political.
[2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:08.280]  I didn't know what, what party I was in until I was 30 years old in the military.
[2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:10.480]  I've been in there since 1983.
[2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:12.360]  I knew that I came in under Reagan.
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:13.880]  I served every president.
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:14.880]  I've protected.
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:15.880]  Man, you got some good genes.
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:16.880]  You don't look like you're that old.
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:17.880]  56.
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:18.880]  No, 58.
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:19.880]  I don't know.
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:20.880]  What am I saying?
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:21.880]  Yeah, that's my TBI kicking in.
[2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:24.400]  I got blown up a few times.
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:27.360]  So brings us to moving along.
[2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:28.440]  I get to the border.
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:30.200]  All of a sudden we got to give everybody vaccines.
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:31.640]  We've got a deadline.
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:34.080]  Deadline for the National Guard is June of 2022.
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:36.280]  Stay right there.
[2:15:36.280 --> 2:15:38.240]  Dr. Peter Chambers is with us.

[2:17:05.560 --> 2:17:06.560]  Challenge.
[2:17:06.560 --> 2:17:07.960]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:13.480]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:18.960]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or H-spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:24.960]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:28.280]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:17:28.280 --> 2:17:32.320]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:35.920]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:40.440]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:45.520]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket, this is working, this
[2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:47.800]  is wonderful, you know.
[2:17:47.800 --> 2:17:53.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:55.920]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:17:55.920 --> 2:18:01.000]  This is a great sponsor.
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:05.200]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated
[2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:06.200]  satellite phone.

[2:18:10.360 --> 2:18:11.360]  can see the sky.

[2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:33.120]  These aren't.
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:34.520]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:39.320]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:42.760]  So the calls you are free or it's like a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced.
[2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:46.520]  And I keep one on my car, I've given it to my parents as gifts, way out the middle of
[2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:53.760]  nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work, m4warsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020
[2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:57.120]  and ask the Alex Jones special.
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:19:01.920]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:03.960]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:09.680]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:10.680]  But we failed.
[2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:12.000]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.280]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[2:19:14.280 --> 2:19:20.280]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[2:19:20.280 --> 2:19:24.600]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[2:19:24.600 --> 2:19:29.200]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:32.120]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:34.320]  But we've also got to get personally prepared.
[2:19:34.320 --> 2:19:37.120]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:41.960]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at m4warsphone.com.
[2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:46.080]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:47.560]  to ship right now.
[2:19:47.560 --> 2:19:52.640]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:54.920]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[2:19:54.920 --> 2:19:58.920]  Get ready at m4warsstore.com.
[2:19:58.920 --> 2:20:24.920]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:24.920 --> 2:20:29.120]  Very powerful information and he covered the last hour, but he's got a few questions.
[2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:33.400]  We've got the Peter Chambers and some of these topics before we leave, but Doc, you were
[2:20:33.400 --> 2:20:35.560]  getting some really important stuff in the break cut you off.
[2:20:35.560 --> 2:20:39.680]  You were talking about how you got assigned by the Pentagon, by the military to advise
[2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:43.400]  him and as soon as you brought up all these therapeutics as a medical doctor, you got
[2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:44.400]  shut down.
[2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:45.400]  That's huge news.
[2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:46.400]  Yes, sir.
[2:20:46.400 --> 2:20:48.400]  So I was assigned by the Texas Military Department.
[2:20:48.400 --> 2:20:49.400]  Texas Military Department.
[2:20:49.400 --> 2:20:50.400]  Right.
[2:20:50.400 --> 2:20:55.800]  And this happened because I'm dealing with the lead on that, which was public health.
[2:20:55.800 --> 2:20:59.280]  And typically you see public health being a little more leftward leaning type people
[2:20:59.280 --> 2:21:00.800]  and I got it.
[2:21:00.800 --> 2:21:03.540]  My idea of full spectrum American is a bell curve.
[2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:04.540]  We all live under it.
[2:21:04.540 --> 2:21:06.680]  If you're far right, far left, I got it.
[2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:10.800]  But the people in the middle that go to work, pay their bills, pay their taxes, live within
[2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:13.920]  the means of the law, those people are the full spectrum Americans.
[2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:16.680]  I get out and help my neighbor when something happens.
[2:21:16.680 --> 2:21:22.400]  You're outside that curve, you're from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, you're those people.
[2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:23.400]  You're outside that curve.
[2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:24.400]  You're not a full spectrum American.
[2:21:24.400 --> 2:21:25.400]  You won't help your neighbors.
[2:21:25.400 --> 2:21:27.000]  So I see that.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:30.560]  And then I'm thinking, all right, how can we change that?
[2:21:30.560 --> 2:21:32.400]  And that's why I'm glad that you have me on.
[2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:33.400]  I do appreciate it.
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:38.720]  But I appreciate you, but maybe you were hitting that point of then the next point about what
[2:21:38.720 --> 2:21:40.400]  was happening with that shutdown.
[2:21:40.400 --> 2:21:41.400]  Okay.
[2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:46.280]  So the shutdown on, okay, yeah, yeah, I got TBI, right?
[2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:50.200]  And I did take the shots, unfortunately, in January, and let me tell you how that happened.
[2:21:50.200 --> 2:21:51.400]  And I'm going to go back to that.
[2:21:51.400 --> 2:21:52.400]  Just remind me.
[2:21:52.400 --> 2:21:56.280]  Uh, so in January, they said, Hey, doc, you got to go to the border January, 2021.
[2:21:56.280 --> 2:21:58.920]  I'm like, okay, well, but you got to take a shot.
[2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:02.320]  I'm like, okay, we didn't know about the Delta side effects at that time.
[2:22:02.320 --> 2:22:03.320]  So I'm like, well, you know what?
[2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:05.360]  I trusted my government since 1983.
[2:22:05.360 --> 2:22:10.040]  And I've had every shot known to man going to every country, 56 countries in the world.
[2:22:10.040 --> 2:22:13.360]  And I said, okay, yeah, Roger, that'll take the shot and get to work.
[2:22:13.360 --> 2:22:18.080]  Three months later, I got a serious episode of brain fog, vertigo, nearly truck crashed
[2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:24.160]  my truck, got out when I got an MRI, I got what's called demyelination of my, of certain
[2:22:24.160 --> 2:22:27.880]  processes in the brain, which looks almost like multiple sclerosis.
[2:22:27.880 --> 2:22:28.880]  All right.
[2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:32.920]  So, so the literal structure of the brain, the, the, well, your medical doctor explained
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:33.920]  that amazing.
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:34.920]  Yeah.
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:38.080]  So if you're looking at like Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's has this thing called neurofibrillary
[2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:39.080]  tangles.
[2:22:39.080 --> 2:22:43.200]  You lose the, you lose the electrical, the ability to, it's, it's like seeing a wire
[2:22:43.200 --> 2:22:45.480]  with no rubber on the outside of it.
[2:22:45.480 --> 2:22:46.480]  No coating on the wire.
[2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:47.480]  You lose the cholesterol.
[2:22:47.480 --> 2:22:48.480]  Yeah.
[2:22:48.480 --> 2:22:49.480]  Yeah.
[2:22:49.480 --> 2:22:50.480]  Exactly.
[2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:51.480]  Yeah.
[2:22:51.480 --> 2:22:54.280]  You lose the cholesterol, the, the, the myelination process that's around that nerve that's sending
[2:22:54.280 --> 2:22:55.800]  that, that impulse.
[2:22:55.800 --> 2:22:57.120]  And so you see this on that.
[2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:00.640]  Now you back, go backwards a little bit and I'm talking to these people in the, in the
[2:23:00.640 --> 2:23:05.560]  operation center of these, these public health and it's the doctors and they're in charge.
[2:23:05.560 --> 2:23:08.320]  And I say, Hey, there's some studies coming out of India.
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:09.680]  There's people in Africa.
[2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:10.880]  They're already on Avramectin.
[2:23:10.880 --> 2:23:14.640]  They're already on hydroxychloroquine because I've been giving it soldiers for years with
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:17.040]  no QT problems, with no heart problems.
[2:23:17.040 --> 2:23:19.360]  We're not giving super massive doses.
[2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:20.760]  They're not laboratory animals.
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:21.760]  Roger that.
[2:23:21.760 --> 2:23:22.760]  We just don't talk about that.
[2:23:22.760 --> 2:23:26.480]  And when I finally got down to it, it was because it had been politicized.
[2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:27.480]  Absolutely.
[2:23:27.480 --> 2:23:30.680]  They don't want, so if somebody could get questions, I do pretty amazing though.
[2:23:30.680 --> 2:23:34.840]  This is a guy, you know, I mean, I always call it the Biden administration is really
[2:23:34.840 --> 2:23:39.160]  the third Obama administration to lie, slip up and say the Pentagon, the Texas guard,
[2:23:39.160 --> 2:23:42.520]  the Pentagon, but, but I mean, this is a big deal.
[2:23:42.520 --> 2:23:48.200]  Here he is, the main doctor that, that, that Texas has the governor, it's being ignored.
[2:23:48.200 --> 2:23:49.200]  It's extraordinary.
[2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:50.200]  It's really great to meet you, sir.
[2:23:50.200 --> 2:23:53.280]  By the way, and thank you for all that you do for our country.
[2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:58.040]  And the question I have for you is in your assessment, here's the thought experiment.
[2:23:58.040 --> 2:24:02.480]  You know, I presented numbers in the last hour that we, we could see up to one third
[2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:06.640]  of those who took these vaccines, especially if they continue to take the booster shots,
[2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:10.800]  they could, could die over the next decade.
[2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:13.320]  Hopefully we can find ways to help those people, by the way.
[2:24:13.320 --> 2:24:18.440]  But if we don't, I want to ask you what happens to military readiness, national security,
[2:24:18.440 --> 2:24:23.880]  and also through the guard, what happens to the ability for states to respond to local
[2:24:23.880 --> 2:24:29.360]  disasters and collapse events if they lose even a quarter of their active duty personnel?
[2:24:29.360 --> 2:24:32.840]  Just with that assumption, if we lose one quarter, what happens to America?
[2:24:32.840 --> 2:24:36.520]  Okay, so if we're, if we're purging troops right now, if we're just looking at that,
[2:24:36.520 --> 2:24:39.280]  not, not the deleterious side effects, I've got troops in the hospital right now.
[2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:43.320]  I was about to say, you read my brain, doctor, you got critical race theory and not taking
[2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:44.320]  the shots.
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:45.320]  That alone is going to do that.
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:46.320]  Right.
[2:24:46.320 --> 2:24:49.520]  But if you say that there's a mandate and by this date, you're out.
[2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:54.480]  If you say, I want a, and a religious or a medical exemption, which are not being listened
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:55.480]  to.
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:24:56.480]  Right.
[2:24:56.480 --> 2:24:57.480]  Period.
[2:24:57.480 --> 2:24:58.480]  We know that.
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:00.720]  And I'm not going to name names, but there are people within our own ranks who say, we're
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:03.520]  not going to listen to that, tell them to get out.
[2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:04.520]  We'll find a reason to get them out.
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:05.520]  All right.
[2:25:05.520 --> 2:25:06.520]  So I got it.
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:09.000]  You take roughly vaccinated on the border.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  For example, somewhere between, I can't say the specific numbers of people on the border
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:17.640]  right now, it's OPSEC, but I'm going to say that somewhere between 30 and 40% have been
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:18.640]  vaccinated.
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:19.640]  All right.
[2:25:19.640 --> 2:25:24.240]  We're going to boot 60% of the people on the border right now or in the Texas guard.
[2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:26.120]  Let's just look at that microcosm.
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:28.880]  Forget about the DOD side of the house, the active duty.
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:29.880]  What are we going to do there?
[2:25:29.880 --> 2:25:33.400]  But I'm, I'm even adding, if you don't mind me interrupting, they kick out the people
[2:25:33.400 --> 2:25:38.520]  who reject the vaccines, but then those who are vaccinated suffer injuries and some suffer
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:39.520]  deaths.
[2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:44.440]  So who's left to do the job that you're entrusted to do?
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:45.440]  Exactly.
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:48.120]  If you want to shut a country down, give them a shot, let people know it's killing them
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:50.920]  and making them sick and then make people quit to collapse civilization.
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:51.920]  Yeah.
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:53.680]  I mean, that's literally how you take a country down without firing a shot.
[2:25:53.680 --> 2:25:55.720]  How do we have national security readiness?
[2:25:55.720 --> 2:25:56.720]  I'm going to throw this out there.
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:25:58.840]  If I was to make a bio weapon, how would I do it?
[2:25:58.840 --> 2:25:59.840]  What would I want to do?
[2:25:59.840 --> 2:26:02.440]  I'd put it in a vaccine rhetorical question, right?
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:03.440]  Yeah.
[2:26:03.440 --> 2:26:06.600]  And you'd want to cause a lot of injury so that the people who are survivors have to
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:10.440]  take care of the injured, which then discredits the government that did it, but it's really
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:11.440]  the Davos group.
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:13.440]  It's the same theory as a punjee stick in Vietnam.
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:14.440]  That's right.
[2:26:14.440 --> 2:26:15.440]  All right.
[2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:16.440]  You take out a guy, he's got a hole through his boot.
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:17.840]  Two guys got to carry him off.
[2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:18.840]  Right.
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:19.840]  Yeah.
[2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:20.840]  Same thing.
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:21.840]  And it's the fight I'm in.
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:22.840]  It's the fight I'm in every day.
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:25.880]  I got guys on state active duty orders who don't have insurance, by the way, they have
[2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:30.560]  workman's comp and they're in the hospital right now, hopefully with some kind of insurance
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:33.320]  taking care of side effects.
[2:26:33.320 --> 2:26:34.320]  What happens now?
[2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:39.160]  I mean, I know a very well known talk show host and here in Austin and a couple members
[2:26:39.160 --> 2:26:42.320]  of his security team just took it was any other security and they're sick and these
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:43.320]  are tough guys.
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:44.320]  They're like, they're scared.
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:46.800]  They're like, I've taken a bunch of shots in the military like you did, like you said
[2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:47.800]  you did.
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:49.000]  And they're like, nothing ever did this.
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:50.480]  Like what the hell is this?
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:51.720]  You might have a sore arm.
[2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:55.680]  You might have a fever, malaise about it, the previous stuff.
[2:26:55.680 --> 2:26:56.680]  Including anthrax.
[2:26:56.680 --> 2:27:00.480]  Well, you, you, you seem like a very healthy individual.
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:02.560]  So you're probably going to be much better off.
[2:27:02.560 --> 2:27:05.200]  You're going to be in the okay group, even though you've already mentioned a couple
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:06.200]  of things.
[2:27:06.200 --> 2:27:09.120]  I've signed on with America's frontline doctors on the FAA deal we just did recently and Peter
[2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:12.520]  McCullough has been kind of helping me through some other people and then Theresa Long.
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:13.520]  She's another flight surgeon.
[2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:14.520]  She's been helping me.
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:18.000]  And so we're taking some stuff to mitigate the effects and I'm helping people and I'm
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  teaching them.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:22.160]  Well, that was about to say the trillion dollar question is obviously for everything the
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:25.840]  enemy does, God gave us things for nature to counter it, what are the counters to these
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:26.840]  shots?
[2:27:26.840 --> 2:27:29.560]  Well, but I'm just thinking about a lot of the younger guys in the line of duty right
[2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:33.800]  now who, who aren't typically old enough to have the wisdom to start thinking about what
[2:27:33.800 --> 2:27:37.400]  they're putting in their mouths and they're eating junk food and right.
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:38.400]  I know where you're going.
[2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:40.320]  It's, it's called informed consent.
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:41.320]  And here's the deal.
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:44.240]  It's number one on the Nuremberg code list.
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:45.760]  Number one informed consent.
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:46.760]  Right.
[2:27:46.760 --> 2:27:47.760]  Well, we don't do it.
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:50.360]  And first of all, it's against the regulations of the army because it's an emergency use
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:51.360]  authorization.
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:52.520]  We don't do informed consent.
[2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:53.520]  That was my first fight.
[2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:55.680]  I had two stars yelling at me about that.
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:56.680]  All right.
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:27:58.040]  So finally got that approved.
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:27:59.280]  I've been chewed out before.
[2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:00.280]  It happens.
[2:28:00.280 --> 2:28:01.280]  And glorious bastards.
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:02.280]  All right.
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:03.960]  So I've been there before, but I got that approved.
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:04.960]  I was able to do it.
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:07.840]  And when they weren't taking the shots because they were listening to, they were doing the,
[2:28:07.840 --> 2:28:09.640]  I give them the pluses and the minuses.
[2:28:09.640 --> 2:28:11.720]  I don't tell them what to do.
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:16.840]  We got six people out of 2000 take the shots.
[2:28:16.840 --> 2:28:17.840]  Now what?
[2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:21.240]  Now do these mad at us because you're not to giving the shots.
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:23.280]  And it's a globalist plan to destroy our military.
[2:28:23.280 --> 2:28:27.040]  Well, I think because on record, it doesn't protect you long-term if it was a perfect
[2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:28.040]  bio weapon.
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:29.360]  That's exactly what I would do.
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:34.200]  Well, America who's going to be remaining to protect America are the survivors of the
[2:28:34.200 --> 2:28:37.640]  shots and those who did not take affirmative.
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:38.640]  That's that's what we've got.
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:41.880]  And those that figure out a way to mitigate it, Mike Adams, naturalnews.com, incredible
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:43.040]  global alert.
[2:28:43.040 --> 2:28:45.360]  It's on naturalnews.com and info wars.com.
[2:28:45.360 --> 2:28:46.360]  God bless you and thank you.
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:47.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:48.360]  Thank you.
[2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:51.520]  Stay there, we're going to come back with Dr. Peter Chambers and he's got a bunch of
[2:28:51.520 --> 2:28:55.600]  key topics to covers and he's got the website, fullspectrumamerican.com.
[2:28:55.600 --> 2:28:57.960]  Stay with us.
[2:28:57.960 --> 2:29:02.880]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:04.840]  the globalists are doing right now.
[2:29:04.840 --> 2:29:06.560]  This is their big offensive.
[2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:07.960]  This is their takeover.
[2:29:07.960 --> 2:29:11.120]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed
[2:29:11.120 --> 2:29:12.120]  themselves.
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:16.000]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  in the open.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:21.520]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:25.760]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:29.040]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:33.720]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:34.720]  you keep us on air.
[2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:38.520]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[2:29:38.520 --> 2:29:42.000]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers.
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:47.880]  They are so good for your body, and if there's two things you do for your body, it's these
[2:29:47.880 --> 2:29:48.880]  two products.
[2:29:48.880 --> 2:29:53.320]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[2:29:53.320 --> 2:29:57.240]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[2:29:57.240 --> 2:30:04.160]  In late August, infowar saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that
[2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:10.360]  the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[2:30:10.360 --> 2:30:13.520]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[2:30:13.520 --> 2:30:16.760]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to
[2:30:16.760 --> 2:30:17.760]  have.
[2:30:17.760 --> 2:30:22.240]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[2:30:22.240 --> 2:30:24.520]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[2:30:24.520 --> 2:30:27.920]  But now, more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[2:30:27.920 --> 2:30:31.320]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[2:30:31.320 --> 2:30:32.320]  It's high quality.
[2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:37.040]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see
[2:30:37.040 --> 2:30:41.360]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[2:30:41.360 --> 2:30:42.720]  already taking place.
[2:30:42.720 --> 2:30:49.000]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:53.640]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[2:30:53.640 --> 2:30:55.920]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:55.920 --> 2:31:01.520]  Get our great bag of it here.
[2:31:01.520 --> 2:31:05.840]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[2:31:05.840 --> 2:31:10.960]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[2:31:10.960 --> 2:31:13.520]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[2:31:13.520 --> 2:31:16.960]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[2:31:16.960 --> 2:31:18.280]  but really they're just a commune.
[2:31:18.280 --> 2:31:21.280]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[2:31:21.280 --> 2:31:23.480]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[2:31:23.480 --> 2:31:26.680]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[2:31:26.680 --> 2:31:27.880]  and the price has never gone up.
[2:31:27.880 --> 2:31:32.280]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[2:31:32.280 --> 2:31:34.760]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[2:31:34.760 --> 2:31:38.040]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[2:31:38.040 --> 2:31:41.120]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[2:31:41.120 --> 2:31:46.320]  We had one, I think you wouldn't believe it.
[2:31:46.320 --> 2:31:50.920]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[2:31:50.920 --> 2:31:58.880]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:02.960]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[2:32:02.960 --> 2:32:05.920]  It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know.
[2:32:05.920 --> 2:32:12.640]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:19.200]  of dollars in other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:22.200]  property, energy.
[2:32:22.200 --> 2:32:24.200]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence.
[2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:29.640]  And in the past, they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[2:32:29.640 --> 2:32:34.080]  manipulated market so they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation
[2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:36.240]  or it would cause massive inflation.
[2:32:36.240 --> 2:32:40.800]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[2:32:40.800 --> 2:32:42.800]  buying up everything.
[2:32:42.800 --> 2:32:47.520]  Not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force the collapse
[2:32:47.520 --> 2:32:51.800]  of civilization, making the companies they do fund the only things left standing.
[2:32:51.800 --> 2:32:52.800]  This is the Great Reset.
[2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:53.800]  This is what's happening now.
[2:32:53.800 --> 2:32:54.800]  Warn everyone.
[2:32:54.800 --> 2:32:59.080]  It's the only way to stop it.
[2:32:59.080 --> 2:33:21.600]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:21.600 --> 2:33:35.600]  In the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:42.680]  Dr. Peter Chambers is a veteran and he's currently in the Texas Guard and he has been the main
[2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:47.320]  advisor to the governor of Texas on what was happening with COVID and got shut down by
[2:33:47.320 --> 2:33:48.320]  the bureaucrats.
[2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:51.840]  You're making a lot of really powerful points, I just want to continue to try to get you
[2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:56.440]  to lay out anything you want to get into, what you witness unfolding and what you think
[2:33:56.440 --> 2:33:57.960]  the American people should do.
[2:33:57.960 --> 2:34:02.600]  Yeah, and first of all, also, I wasn't the main advisor, but I was an advisor to your
[2:34:02.600 --> 2:34:03.600]  staff.
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:06.880]  Yeah, I just always want to make sure I don't say, Mr. President.
[2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:08.880]  You were the president of the United States.
[2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:11.400]  You were the President of Mars.
[2:34:11.400 --> 2:34:13.120]  You don't want me as the president.
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:14.960]  I would fire every general out there.
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:16.560]  I'm going to promote you though.
[2:34:16.560 --> 2:34:20.240]  You're the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dr. Peter Chambers is the current
[2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:21.240]  chairman.
[2:34:21.240 --> 2:34:22.240]  There you go.
[2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:23.240]  All right.
[2:34:23.240 --> 2:34:24.480]  I'll be in the area all day.
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:25.480]  Carry on.
[2:34:25.480 --> 2:34:26.480]  No, seriously.
[2:34:26.480 --> 2:34:27.480]  All right.
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:32.640]  So, when I worked in the staff, where do you want me to go with that now?
[2:34:32.640 --> 2:34:33.640]  You're a smart guy.
[2:34:33.640 --> 2:34:34.640]  You've got a million stories.
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:35.640]  What else do you want folks to know?
[2:34:35.640 --> 2:34:36.640]  You're a whistleblower, exposing...
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:38.800]  Okay, let me talk about whistleblowers just a little bit.
[2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:44.360]  We brought this up last night at the fundraiser in Houston.
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:47.560]  I went to a congressman who's out of the Houston area.
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:48.560]  He's a former CO.
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:49.560]  He wears a patch.
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:54.200]  And I said, through his whistleblower site, and I said, hey, I need some help, brother.
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:34:56.760]  And you'd think, you know, there would be some loyalty there to the...
[2:34:56.760 --> 2:34:57.760]  Come up the gay pirate.
[2:34:57.760 --> 2:34:59.760]  Well, I don't know about that, but...
[2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:00.760]  It's a joke.
[2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:01.760]  Yeah, but...
[2:35:01.760 --> 2:35:02.760]  Come up Crenshaw.
[2:35:02.760 --> 2:35:03.760]  You're being nice.
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:04.760]  Right, right.
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:06.920]  So, I got crickets back, and I had somebody call him.
[2:35:06.920 --> 2:35:07.920]  Who knew him?
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:08.920]  Another CO.
[2:35:08.920 --> 2:35:09.920]  Said, hey, brother, I got this guy on the phone.
[2:35:09.920 --> 2:35:10.920]  You need to help him out.
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:12.640]  You want the saw, man?
[2:35:12.640 --> 2:35:13.640]  Yeah.
[2:35:13.640 --> 2:35:14.640]  No, he didn't help me.
[2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:15.640]  It was a different one.
[2:35:15.640 --> 2:35:18.680]  Different one that knew him in his officer days.
[2:35:18.680 --> 2:35:20.320]  That was an officer with him.
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:22.800]  And he said, yeah, that's too political.
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:23.800]  We're not going to talk about that.
[2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:26.280]  Well, if you're in politics, how can it be too political?
[2:35:26.280 --> 2:35:27.280]  I'm in the NFL.
[2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:29.280]  I'm not going to play football.
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:30.280]  Right, right.
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:31.280]  Okay, so, you know, it's too political.
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:32.280]  I got it.
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:35.400]  But, you know, my concern is that the regulation is not being upheld when we're not giving
[2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:36.400]  informed consent.
[2:35:36.400 --> 2:35:39.040]  I've got to let soldiers know what it's all about.
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:40.040]  I can't receive a letter.
[2:35:40.040 --> 2:35:41.040]  What you immediately...
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:43.400]  The courts found it was true, but the anthrax shots, they couldn't do it, because it wasn't.
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:44.400]  It was experimental.
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:45.400]  Right.
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:48.760]  And so you're bringing that up as a medical doctor, and Mr. Eyepatch wouldn't talk to
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:49.760]  you.
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:50.760]  I said, this is the problem.
[2:35:50.760 --> 2:35:51.760]  Here it is.
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:52.760]  Read it.
[2:35:52.760 --> 2:35:53.760]  Let's start over.
[2:35:53.760 --> 2:35:54.760]  This is a huge story about Dan Crenshaw.
[2:35:54.760 --> 2:35:55.760]  Start over.
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:35:59.800]  All right, so in this fight on the border, as the surgeon down there, I'm trying to do
[2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:00.800]  informed consent.
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:01.800]  So I got in trouble.
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:03.600]  I got fired for about an hour, actually.
[2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:06.680]  They called me back and unfired me, because they needed me down.
[2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:07.680]  They was the only guy.
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:10.760]  They didn't unfire me because I was great.
[2:36:10.760 --> 2:36:14.320]  But we are covering down from Brownsville to the Big Bend.
[2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:18.000]  We've got 17,000 to 20,000 people coming across a week.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:21.480]  It's an important mission for the state and for this country.
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:22.600]  So it needs to be looked at.
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:27.280]  So if I send you a whistleblower through your website, and you don't listen to it, or you
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:32.360]  don't even look at it, or if you do, you don't give me the courtesy of a special operation.
[2:36:32.360 --> 2:36:34.680]  It's a dereliction of duty.
[2:36:34.680 --> 2:36:36.360]  In my book, it would be.
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:39.840]  At least the courtesy of calling me and saying, no, I don't want to handle it.
[2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:41.360]  I've served this country just like you did.
[2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:43.160]  I got a purple heart just like you did.
[2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:44.160]  I've been downrange.
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:51.680]  I've put 21 Americans in a body bag, and I promise you, I will not turn anybody down
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:52.680]  for help.
[2:36:52.680 --> 2:36:53.840]  At least call them back.
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:54.840]  And that's what I needed.
[2:36:54.840 --> 2:36:55.840]  And I got zero.
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:36:56.840]  Yeah.
[2:36:56.840 --> 2:37:02.080]  I don't want to, getting into Craig Shaw is a whole other ball of wax, but he is definitely
[2:37:02.080 --> 2:37:03.440]  into it for himself.
[2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:07.760]  And he does all, the deceptions he engages in, but you're just saying that's part of the
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:09.920]  course what you're dealing with.
[2:37:09.920 --> 2:37:11.760]  With that particular case, yes.
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:14.320]  You know, I stay away from, I don't know how he votes.
[2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:15.320]  I haven't paid attention.
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:16.320]  I've been on the border.
[2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:17.320]  I've been every third night.
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:20.040]  Well, I saw a video of him last week where he lied to his constituents and goes, I've
[2:37:20.040 --> 2:37:22.320]  got the most conservative voting record.
[2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:28.680]  Don't listen, you know, don't listen to Gozer and don't listen to Marjorie Taylor Green.
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:29.680]  They're lying.
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:30.880]  They don't vote good for America.
[2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:31.880]  I do.
[2:37:31.880 --> 2:37:32.880]  And I went to the record.
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:33.880]  He's a liar.
[2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:37.800]  I mean, I don't want to, it's funny you brought up Prince Shaw almost attacked him this week,
[2:37:37.800 --> 2:37:43.040]  but I didn't do it because he's not even worth it, but he is a lying sack of shit.
[2:37:43.040 --> 2:37:45.880]  Sorry, I'm going to stop right there.
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:46.880]  Okay.
[2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:49.120]  Well, you know, that, that's the fight I'm in.
[2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:53.400]  So I went to another congressman in Oklahoma, good friend of mine.
[2:37:53.400 --> 2:37:56.280]  This is the guy that went down range and got Americans and came back.
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:37:57.280]  I don't even remember hearing about it.
[2:37:57.280 --> 2:37:58.280]  I did.
[2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:01.720]  Second district, Mark Wayne Mullen, great American, and he helped me out and he called
[2:38:01.720 --> 2:38:05.960]  the office directly and had something happen to where then governor Abbott said, all right,
[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:09.080]  fine, you can do informed consents or we're going to protect the soldiers.
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:12.320]  But the problem is I haven't seen it come down in writing.
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:15.360]  And until I see it come down to writing, I don't know.
[2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:16.360]  And that's, that's what I need.
[2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:19.400]  And again, all you're doing is following common sense in the law and the Nuremberg code, right?
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:20.720]  That's where that comes from.
[2:38:20.720 --> 2:38:21.720]  There's that.
[2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:23.840]  There's first of all, do no harm to Hippocratic oath.
[2:38:23.840 --> 2:38:28.280]  There's also my, my, the position I'm in, special staff to the commander, but I also
[2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:29.600]  take care of troops.
[2:38:29.600 --> 2:38:30.600]  Okay.
[2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:34.880]  So if you have regulations, army regulation, 40-562, clearly states chapter eight paragraph
[2:38:34.880 --> 2:38:39.200]  two, you must do informed consents with emergency use authorizations.
[2:38:39.200 --> 2:38:42.240]  We're not going to Iraq dealing with anthrax.
[2:38:42.240 --> 2:38:43.240]  This is COVID.
[2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:44.240]  It's here.
[2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:45.240]  Right.
[2:38:45.240 --> 2:38:47.240]  So it's not going to change what we do.
[2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:49.080]  We're going to be on the border whether it's here or not.
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:50.080]  We're not.
[2:38:50.080 --> 2:38:51.720]  And has a super low death rate.
[2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:52.720]  Absolutely.
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:58.120]  And the, in the age groups of the people I'm dealing in, 99.997, 998, you know, those are
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:38:59.120]  the age groups.
[2:38:59.120 --> 2:39:03.520]  And if I give them some, uh, nutraceuticals or if I give them some ivermectin or I preff
[2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:07.240]  prophylactically could give them, if I was really dealing with a lot of migrants that
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:12.120]  were coming across who were not testing, by the way, if I was dealing with that, I could
[2:39:12.120 --> 2:39:16.720]  give them some hydroxychloroquine prophylactically and keep them from getting it.
[2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:17.720]  We give it to them.
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:19.080]  We give that to them anyway from malaria.
[2:39:19.080 --> 2:39:20.240]  Why are we not doing it down there?
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:24.120]  If they're meeting thousands of people, there's some points that one night 900 people are
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:25.120]  across.
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:26.120]  Oh, I've seen it.
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:27.120]  You've seen it.
[2:39:27.120 --> 2:39:29.840]  We've seen waves or the Caribbean ones, it's like thousands a day.
[2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:30.840]  Yeah.
[2:39:30.840 --> 2:39:33.680]  So if we are concerned about that, we either are or we aren't.
[2:39:33.680 --> 2:39:34.680]  Exactly.
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:38.920]  Like, like we're all in checkpoints and under martial law, basically, in some of the blue
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:41.120]  cities, but then the borders wide open.
[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:42.120]  Farmer.
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:47.720]  900 times higher rate of COVID infection rates, transmission rates in the valley, in the real
[2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:52.400]  Grand Valley, because it shows it's not about the disease, it's about power and control.
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:58.120]  So Dr. Chambers, just as an American, just just just giving your opinion, what do you
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:02.640]  think this whole COVID thing's really about?
[2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:03.640]  Mass control.
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:08.280]  This is Pete Chambers, full spectrum American mass control in masses.
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:12.160]  I've got to control you with fear and fear is not what we live under and it's in the
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:13.160]  Bible.
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:16.320]  I grew up, you know, you're not given a spirit of fear, but a victory.
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:17.320]  That's right.
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:21.400]  Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything through prayer and petition, present your
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:25.040]  request to God and the peace of God, which transcends all understanding will guard your
[2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:26.440]  heart and your mind.
[2:40:26.440 --> 2:40:29.880]  That's what I say to myself before I go to combat, for I jump out of a plane because
[2:40:29.880 --> 2:40:33.920]  that come out and I'm ready to go just like this dog looking for work.
[2:40:33.920 --> 2:40:34.920]  Yeah.
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:39.400]  That's so powerful, though, again, we are not given to a spirit of fear, are we?
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:40.400]  No, sir.
[2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:44.400]  Again, we give the spirit of fear, then we take the shot that doesn't even protect us.
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:45.400]  Crazy.
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:48.560]  So where do you see all this going because it looks like America and the world's waking
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:51.800]  up to this being a fraud?
[2:40:51.800 --> 2:40:55.760]  I see an awakening for the first time I've seen awakening after I got down there and
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:41:00.640]  down into Houston and I saw those people, I asked them, they said, what can we do?
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:01.640]  What can we do?
[2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:02.640]  I said, what do you do?
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:04.240]  He said, I'm a pipeline.
[2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:05.240]  I'm the guy that works.
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:12.760]  He's the engineer that works the pipeline that takes fuel oil to Florida from Texas.
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:16.680]  If he has to take them and he has to take the shots and if he doesn't, he's out.
[2:41:16.680 --> 2:41:18.920]  How many of those guys do we have?
[2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:19.920]  What do we do with that?
[2:41:19.920 --> 2:41:20.920]  I saw numbers.
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:21.920]  What's the second and third order?
[2:41:21.920 --> 2:41:24.680]  Like firing a third of the power line workers, they won't take it.
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:25.680]  What happens when the storm hits?
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:26.680]  Right.
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:27.680]  The power goes out.
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:28.680]  We're in winter now.
[2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:29.680]  What happened last year?
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:30.680]  Hell.
[2:41:30.680 --> 2:41:31.680]  Yeah.
[2:41:31.680 --> 2:41:32.680]  Yeah.
[2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:33.680]  The National Guard was there.
[2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:37.320]  And again, if you look at Klaus Schwab saying, we are going to collapse civilization.
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:38.320]  He's there admitting.
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:41.680]  I don't know who that fellow is, but I don't like him.
[2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:43.560]  Well, he's a doctor.
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:45.240]  I know you're a great patriot.
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:47.480]  Let me tell the whole military who the bad guy is.
[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:48.480]  Yeah.
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:49.480]  Klaus Schwab.
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:50.480]  I'll look it up.
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:51.480]  Have you heard of the Bilderberg group?
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:52.480]  Yes, sir.
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:53.480]  He's the head of that.
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:54.480]  Okay.
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:55.480]  Then he has a Davos group that he's the public head of.
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:56.480]  They run the whole operation.
[2:41:56.480 --> 2:41:57.480]  All right.
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:03.560]  Well, I'll build a targeting package politically, politically, I mean, look, that's the enemy
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:04.560]  right there.
[2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:05.560]  Whoa.
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:06.560]  Okay.
[2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:07.560]  That's a rough looking dude.
[2:42:07.560 --> 2:42:08.560]  All right.
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:09.560]  He is rough.
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:10.560]  He's the one running the whole thing.
[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:11.560]  He's actually in charge of it.
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:12.560]  He's the boss.
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:13.560]  Bill Gates works for him.
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:14.560]  That's the number one.
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:15.560]  The ace of spades.
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:21.080]  There's all these old families, people behind him, but he's one of the top guys.
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:22.080]  Okay.
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:27.080]  His grandfather was the top guy for Hitler and ran the EU, where they launched it officially.
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:29.120]  He's the big guy.
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:33.840]  Well, politically, I don't know that we can affect him, but I know that politically,
[2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:37.920]  we can affect our state because state's rights for me and sovereignty of the state of Texas
[2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:38.920]  is the most important thing.
[2:42:38.920 --> 2:42:39.920]  I agree.
[2:42:39.920 --> 2:42:43.080]  Take our local systems back, and then the enemy is in checkmate.
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:46.400]  We'll be right back with our special guests, and I love the website.

[2:47:09.360 --> 2:47:25.360]  I'm no stranger to the rain, I'm a friend of thunder, friend, is it any wonder a light
[2:47:25.360 --> 2:47:43.160]  comes to me, I fought with the devil, got down on his level, but I never gave in, so
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:47.160]  he gave up on me.
[2:47:47.160 --> 2:47:48.160]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:49.160]  That's right, Keith Whitley and this end here.
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:54.160]  All right, Dr. Peter Chambers, a full-spectrum American, is here.
[2:47:54.160 --> 2:48:01.400]  He is a military army doctor and a combat veteran, a great patriot, and he's a whistleblower
[2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:06.240]  that, going back over a year ago, when they were trying to block Ivermectin for the military
[2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:10.240]  here in Texas and the Border Patrol and others, but you wanted to get into the cartels and
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:13.880]  what's really going on on the border for people that want to know the inside scoop
[2:48:13.880 --> 2:48:16.280]  and what Biden's trying to suppress, please tell us.
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:17.280]  Yes, sir.
[2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:22.320]  For 10 months, I've been on the border working down there as a surgeon, also advising on
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:26.560]  different missions and things like that and the planning phases, but I spend about every
[2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:31.120]  third night on the border with the soldiers because that's how I get to know them.
[2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:38.320]  We currently, and this is sad to say, and I don't like talking about this, but we have
[2:48:38.320 --> 2:48:44.200]  recently four suicides in another one that's been investigated over the past two months.
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:49.160]  This is a tough mission down there, it's been a tough time of year, it's a long mission,
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:52.880]  it's going to be a year to two years and that concerns me, so I spend a lot of time
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:57.920]  getting to know these soldiers and I end up talking to them and when you're looking
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:02.840]  at 400 meters across the other side of the Rio Grande and you see somebody hanging from
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:09.880]  a bridge with their head cut off, or you see it actually happen, it gets concerning, it
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:10.880]  gets concerning.
[2:49:10.880 --> 2:49:14.080]  These are 20-something-year-old kids and they see this and they're out there alone and
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:15.080]  I don't pray.
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:18.080]  They see Road Warrior is a movie, this is the real Road Warrior.
[2:49:18.080 --> 2:49:22.240]  They're watching collapse civilization, rape, murder, baddings, and they're watching their
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:27.000]  news and telling them everything's fine.
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:30.400]  One of the guys from Fox News was down there reporting 50-cow rounds going right over.
[2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:31.400]  He caught it on the air.
[2:49:31.400 --> 2:49:32.400]  Yeah, saw that.
[2:49:32.400 --> 2:49:34.280]  It was Bill Mulligan.
[2:49:34.280 --> 2:49:35.280]  He saw that.
[2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:37.440]  We were there and I was standing there and he said, those are 50-cows?
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:38.440]  I said, yeah, they're 50.
[2:49:38.440 --> 2:49:42.120]  You can tell by their rate of fire, et cetera, and then some of those rounds on the previous
[2:49:42.120 --> 2:49:46.320]  time ended up in town hitting a civilian in the belly, so these are the things that
[2:49:46.320 --> 2:49:47.320]  the cartels don't care.
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:48.880]  There's no fear about criminals anyway.
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:51.240]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:49:51.240 --> 2:49:56.200]  That's an occurrence that happens pretty regularly in certain parts of the Rio Grande, and it's
[2:49:56.200 --> 2:50:01.040]  something our soldiers deal with, where we're body armor, we have up-armor vehicles.
[2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:05.200]  These kids are out there alone and unafraid looking at cartels who take their playbook
[2:50:05.200 --> 2:50:08.120]  from ISIS, period.
[2:50:08.120 --> 2:50:13.160]  There are five different ones that we deal with down there from Brownsville to the Big
[2:50:13.160 --> 2:50:19.040]  Bend, and they have different playbooks, and some of them are ruthless, and that's what
[2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:20.040]  we're dealing with.
[2:50:20.040 --> 2:50:24.320]  Last time I was in Big Bend three years ago with my children, there's that hot spring
[2:50:24.320 --> 2:50:28.200]  right there on the Rio Grande you go to, and the police are there writing tickets for people
[2:50:28.200 --> 2:50:33.000]  drinking beer while cartels are bringing drugs across on horses right in front of us.
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:37.120]  I mean, it's like, how have we gotten like that?
[2:50:37.120 --> 2:50:38.560]  How have we gotten like that?
[2:50:38.560 --> 2:50:39.560]  Boldness.
[2:50:39.560 --> 2:50:40.920]  There's boldness on their side.
[2:50:40.920 --> 2:50:43.680]  They don't have fear because there's no teeth in it.
[2:50:43.680 --> 2:50:48.440]  You know who scared more people back across the river in Del Rio when there were 17,000
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:50.520]  Haitians a few months ago?
[2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:54.760]  That dog right there, because they didn't know about him whether he had fear or not,
[2:50:54.760 --> 2:50:56.280]  but he sent them back.
[2:50:56.280 --> 2:50:59.640]  Guys on horses, I got the split rain thing.
[2:50:59.640 --> 2:51:04.240]  That was ridiculous what they did to that Border Patrol agent or those guys.
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:08.240]  They only understand fear, all right, the bad guys.
[2:51:08.240 --> 2:51:10.240]  Bad guys only understand fear.
[2:51:10.240 --> 2:51:14.240]  And they know they can just walk across and get, you know, give us basically a high five
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:15.680]  as they're passing us.
[2:51:15.680 --> 2:51:16.680]  There's no teeth in it.
[2:51:16.680 --> 2:51:18.880]  There's no teeth in apprehension.
[2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:19.880]  Just means we counted their head.
[2:51:19.880 --> 2:51:23.720]  So what do you think, Big Picture, any country that has failed borders while the rest of
[2:51:23.720 --> 2:51:26.720]  the world's collapsing is a failed state?
[2:51:26.720 --> 2:51:30.160]  If that's the definition, then that's what we've got.
[2:51:30.160 --> 2:51:34.720]  So we really are beginning to have a failed state under Biden, which was his job.
[2:51:34.720 --> 2:51:39.520]  Yes, sir, yeah, that right there, that video, is that being shown to the, to the viewers?
[2:51:39.520 --> 2:51:40.520]  Yes, sir.
[2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:41.520]  Okay.
[2:51:41.520 --> 2:51:42.960]  So that's that point right there where that water comes across.
[2:51:42.960 --> 2:51:47.600]  That's where Joe and I stood for, for a few hours, stopping that flow of traffic until
[2:51:47.600 --> 2:51:49.160]  we can get somebody down there.
[2:51:49.160 --> 2:51:50.160]  And Joe's your dog.
[2:51:50.160 --> 2:51:51.160]  Joe's the dog.
[2:51:51.160 --> 2:51:52.160]  Right.
[2:51:52.160 --> 2:51:53.160]  He's working on it.
[2:51:53.160 --> 2:51:54.160]  So that's cool.
[2:51:54.160 --> 2:51:55.160]  Let's get Joe back up here.
[2:51:55.160 --> 2:51:56.160]  Come here, Joe.
[2:51:56.160 --> 2:51:57.160]  Come here.
[2:51:57.160 --> 2:51:58.160]  Up on my lap.
[2:51:58.160 --> 2:51:59.160]  Come here, buddy.
[2:51:59.160 --> 2:52:00.160]  There's Joe.
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:01.160]  There's Joe.
[2:52:01.160 --> 2:52:02.160]  Joe is a very nice dog.
[2:52:02.160 --> 2:52:03.160]  He's a good fellow.
[2:52:03.160 --> 2:52:04.160]  He's a good fellow.
[2:52:04.160 --> 2:52:05.160]  I think Mike wants to get a Joe pup.
[2:52:05.160 --> 2:52:06.160]  You're likely your last guest there.
[2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:07.160]  I want one.
[2:52:07.160 --> 2:52:08.160]  I'll see.
[2:52:08.160 --> 2:52:11.000]  A little litter, usually about eight to 10, maybe is what they're saying.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  We'll get, I'll see.
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  What do they call those?
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  This is a Dutch Shepherd.
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  Very sweet dog.
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  Very smart too, huh?
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  Smart dog.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  I know you are, Joe.
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  Look at that.
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  Oh, look at that.
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  Look at those eyes.
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  He's a good fellow.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  He's a good fellow.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:24.000]  I see.
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  Okay.
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  He speaks French and Dutch.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  That's how he was trained because he was born there.
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  Yeah.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  Back to evil.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:33.200]  Evil is something that we see and it's the only thing that brings evil to light is
[2:52:33.200 --> 2:52:37.120]  light and that is us and we bring truth and that's what we've been doing.
[2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:39.920]  But we ever wondered like how new wars will be fought.
[2:52:39.920 --> 2:52:40.920]  This is it.
[2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:41.920]  This is the takedown of America.
[2:52:41.920 --> 2:52:45.480]  It's being done to the culture, the media, the globalists are doing this and they love
[2:52:45.480 --> 2:52:47.040]  it because people don't know they're the enemy.
[2:52:47.040 --> 2:52:49.880]  They don't know they're attacking and so they can just get away with anything they
[2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:52.120]  want and never have repercussions.
[2:52:52.120 --> 2:52:56.000]  Just like you said, the criminals, grassroots don't have repercussions and the Klaus Schwab's
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:59.160]  and Bill Gates don't have repercussions.
[2:52:59.160 --> 2:53:02.200]  If you look at, we had World War I, we had World War II.
[2:53:02.200 --> 2:53:07.080]  If you look at the Cold War is World War III, which I do because I was there not operating
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:08.080]  there.
[2:53:08.080 --> 2:53:09.080]  I agree.
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:10.080]  They're calling this World War IV.
[2:53:10.080 --> 2:53:11.080]  Affirmative.
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:12.080]  Absolutely.
[2:53:12.080 --> 2:53:14.080]  This is an information operation campaign and under my other hat that I used to wear
[2:53:14.080 --> 2:53:18.760]  as a Green Beret, when we went to foreign countries, we use the same techniques that
[2:53:18.760 --> 2:53:22.440]  we're using now that are being used on us to overthrow other countries.
[2:53:22.440 --> 2:53:25.280]  It's funny you raised that because I've got another fellow from Army Special Operations
[2:53:25.280 --> 2:53:29.240]  coming on next segment, we're in about 20 minutes, about how they're using military
[2:53:29.240 --> 2:53:31.720]  techniques that were outlawed against Al Qaeda.
[2:53:31.720 --> 2:53:34.280]  I played an OAN club earlier against us.
[2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:35.280]  Okay.
[2:53:35.280 --> 2:53:36.280]  Yeah.
[2:53:36.280 --> 2:53:39.000]  I'm just saying that he's probably the same schoolhouse I've been to.
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:42.520]  Well, tell us from that perspective what you see happening.
[2:53:42.520 --> 2:53:43.520]  Okay.
[2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:48.400]  From information operations, we also call that psychological warfare under unconventional
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:51.440]  warfare model.
[2:53:51.440 --> 2:53:54.200]  There are techniques and there are certain people that are trained to do this and what
[2:53:54.200 --> 2:53:58.520]  we learn about it is Green Berets, but we're more shoot, move, communicate and train.
[2:53:58.520 --> 2:53:59.520]  We train people.
[2:53:59.520 --> 2:54:01.120]  We're force multipliers.
[2:54:01.120 --> 2:54:06.240]  But there's an adjunct that's added to us called civil affairs and psychological operations,
[2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:07.520]  and operations.
[2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:10.680]  When you look at your sign right there, I'm looking at it right behind you, Info Wars.
[2:54:10.680 --> 2:54:11.680]  Yeah.
[2:54:11.680 --> 2:54:12.680]  That's what that is.
[2:54:12.680 --> 2:54:17.360]  World War IV is an Info War and we're fighting for this and it's the narrative and that's
[2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:21.560]  what I said last night to these benefactors that were coming in to support these candidates
[2:54:21.560 --> 2:54:26.240]  is you're in a campaign, you all are in combat.
[2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:28.000]  You just don't know it.
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  What can we do, Doc?
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  I totally agree.
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  You're in a war.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  Realize you're in a war.
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  You got to know it.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  You got to know it.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:38.240]  You know the Udalloop, Observe, Orient, Decidenak, Boyd's Loop, all right?
[2:54:38.240 --> 2:54:40.440]  There's this thing called left a bang and right a bang.
[2:54:40.440 --> 2:54:41.440]  Bang is the IED.
[2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:45.480]  I've been blown up in an IED, 12 May 2004, lost this soldier on my rest here, Jeff Shaver.
[2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:46.480]  Great kid.
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:47.480]  I always told his mom.
[2:54:47.480 --> 2:54:48.480]  I'd always talk about him.
[2:54:48.480 --> 2:54:50.760]  Miss Shaver, I love you.
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:56.640]  He died doing what I told him to do was to man a gun on a truck that day.
[2:54:56.640 --> 2:55:03.760]  If we had been left a bang on the linear timescale before that and we had voided that IED, he
[2:55:03.760 --> 2:55:04.760]  would be here today.
[2:55:04.760 --> 2:55:08.200]  A lot of soldiers would be here today if we weren't ambushed, okay?
[2:55:08.200 --> 2:55:09.200]  We stay left a bang.
[2:55:09.200 --> 2:55:10.400]  Right now we're playing right a bang.
[2:55:10.400 --> 2:55:11.640]  We are way to the right.
[2:55:11.640 --> 2:55:13.240]  We're getting sucker punched.
[2:55:13.240 --> 2:55:14.240]  We're getting hit.
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:15.240]  We don't know we're in a war.
[2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:16.240]  We've got to get in the fight.
[2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:17.240]  My whole job, exactly.
[2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:18.240]  I'm so good at talking.
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:19.240]  People need to wake up.
[2:55:19.240 --> 2:55:20.240]  You're in a war.
[2:55:20.240 --> 2:55:21.240]  You're in a fight.
[2:55:21.240 --> 2:55:22.240]  You better get that straight.
[2:55:22.240 --> 2:55:23.240]  Get in a fight.
[2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:24.240]  Every day, get up, look for work.
[2:55:24.240 --> 2:55:25.240]  Put it on your body armor.
[2:55:25.240 --> 2:55:26.240]  If it's the armor of God, if it's literal.
[2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:27.240]  That's number one, yeah.
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:28.240]  Right?
[2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:29.240]  But for me, it's literal body armor sometimes.
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:34.040]  But when I go to work down there, it's literal body armor, but I always get up and put on
[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:35.040]  the armor of God.
[2:55:35.040 --> 2:55:36.840]  Now, there are days that I don't get up and do it my quiet time and I know that I should,
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:41.200]  but I get convicted somewhere about 11 o'clock, all right?
[2:55:41.200 --> 2:55:42.200]  But that's it.
[2:55:42.200 --> 2:55:43.200]  You're in a war.
[2:55:43.200 --> 2:55:44.200]  You've got to know it.
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:49.400]  You've got to know that if you don't, if you don't get up every day and take that mindset,
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:53.600]  you've already lost because this war is advancing way past you.
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:57.920]  But I'm thinking constantly I'm in a war and getting mad that I can't do more.
[2:55:57.920 --> 2:56:01.760]  For me, it's not thinking I know I'm in a war and I get pissed that if other people will
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:03.640]  just wake up, we win this fight immediately.
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:04.640]  Yes, sir.
[2:56:04.640 --> 2:56:05.640]  Yeah.
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:09.440]  If we all get up and do the motto of my unit was noose, defiance, we defy.
[2:56:09.440 --> 2:56:10.440]  All right.
[2:56:10.440 --> 2:56:15.800]  So it's a skull and cross bones, a special operations thing is N O U S defiance.
[2:56:15.800 --> 2:56:19.240]  It's on my, it's on Full Spectrum American, I got a picture of it.
[2:56:19.240 --> 2:56:20.600]  We defy.
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:21.600]  We defy tyranny.
[2:56:21.600 --> 2:56:22.760]  We defy the enemy.
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:24.260]  We defy evil.
[2:56:24.260 --> 2:56:29.080]  We defy anything that's oppression, the other motto for special forces, deal, press, only
[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:30.080]  bear.
[2:56:30.080 --> 2:56:31.080]  We free the oppressed.
[2:56:31.080 --> 2:56:32.320]  That's what Christ did for us.
[2:56:32.320 --> 2:56:33.320]  Absolutely.
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:34.320]  And how mad does it make you know?
[2:56:34.320 --> 2:56:37.040]  I'm going to cover this next hour that the hostage rescue team, we know is made up of
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:38.040]  that.
[2:56:38.040 --> 2:56:41.720]  And they were actually there at the Capitol helping set Trump on us up on January 6th.
[2:56:41.720 --> 2:56:42.720]  Yeah.
[2:56:42.720 --> 2:56:43.720]  I just heard that.
[2:56:43.720 --> 2:56:44.720]  And that's, that's concerning.
[2:56:44.720 --> 2:56:47.680]  Because if, if, if they're using things like that, you know, we have a positive comatotus
[2:56:47.680 --> 2:56:50.960]  act that says that we cannot go against Americans.
[2:56:50.960 --> 2:56:52.840]  We cannot be utilized in that form.
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:55.320]  Or that 1868.
[2:56:55.320 --> 2:56:56.400]  I don't know the date on that.
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:56:57.400]  That sounds about right.
[2:56:57.400 --> 2:57:02.720]  Uh, if we're seeing anything on that night, yeah, I don't know the exact date for that.
[2:57:02.720 --> 2:57:03.720]  And I get they were there.
[2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:07.200]  They should have been there, but they were there when the police got overrun by like a
[2:57:07.200 --> 2:57:08.640]  hundred punks.
[2:57:08.640 --> 2:57:12.000]  And then they sat there and then, and then, and then it's just, it's not that they were
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:15.360]  following orders, but they need to know that that was a setup.
[2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:16.360]  Right.
[2:57:16.360 --> 2:57:17.360]  Yeah.
[2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:22.120]  That's a false flag type of stuff or, or, uh, setting people up just like the thing in
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:23.120]  Michigan.
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:27.400]  And you know, we saw something recently, the FBI was, uh, sending in where they were their
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:31.320]  own people and they were basically five more minutes and then we're going to come back and
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:34.560]  play a clip of Tucker Carlson talking about January 6th and I'm going to break the big
[2:57:34.560 --> 2:57:35.560]  news here.
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:38.160]  I got a bunch of clubs and more coming up at Dr. Peter Chambers.
[2:57:38.160 --> 2:57:39.920]  I'm really glad my producer recommended you.
[2:57:39.920 --> 2:57:47.720]  She's a big fan and I'm glad you're here and I'm glad you're in Texas right now.
[2:57:47.720 --> 2:57:53.680]  Christmas 2021 is over, but she's still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:58.320]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time making
[2:57:58.320 --> 2:58:03.080]  yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by boosting your immune system.
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:07.920]  Two of our top selling products that have been sold out for a long time are now back
[2:58:07.920 --> 2:58:08.920]  in stock.
[2:58:08.920 --> 2:58:13.280]  Winter sun, the highest quality vitamin D three, take it under the tongue for higher
[2:58:13.280 --> 2:58:15.560]  absorption is back in stock.
[2:58:15.560 --> 2:58:20.320]  Despite the fact it's been sold out for months, it is 50% off and then our number one best
[2:58:20.320 --> 2:58:25.720]  seller of all time, survival shield, X two, deeper crystal iodine, the game changer,
[2:58:25.720 --> 2:58:29.960]  the missing link, not just for immune system, but all electrochemical activity in the body.
[2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:32.320]  It's back in stock 50% off.
[2:58:32.320 --> 2:58:36.920]  So that's the new year special and that's Christmas comes early in 2022.
[2:58:36.920 --> 2:58:40.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X two
[2:58:40.800 --> 2:58:46.480]  and winter sun at infowarstore.com, 50% off for a limited time.
[2:58:46.480 --> 2:58:47.480]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[2:58:47.480 --> 2:58:52.000]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in info wars live products and that's
[2:58:52.000 --> 2:58:56.320]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of ultimate bone broth and we could never
[2:58:56.320 --> 2:59:01.320]  get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and not just use the same
[2:59:01.320 --> 2:59:05.000]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[2:59:05.000 --> 2:59:08.680]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[2:59:08.680 --> 2:59:13.040]  Listen to what it's got in it, cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for
[2:59:13.040 --> 2:59:15.200]  better flavor and dissolvability.
[2:59:15.200 --> 2:59:20.120]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:24.720]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants and
[2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:28.120]  then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[2:59:28.120 --> 2:59:29.120]  added.
[2:59:29.120 --> 2:59:31.320]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[2:59:31.320 --> 2:59:35.880]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of
[2:59:35.880 --> 2:59:37.760]  sea salt and it just goes on and on.
[2:59:37.760 --> 2:59:43.560]  It is now back in stock, ultimate bone broth plus available at 20% off and free shipping
[2:59:43.560 --> 2:59:50.920]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:50.920 --> 3:00:05.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:05.600 --> 3:00:12.800]  We're going down the January 6th rabbit hole on the eve of the anniversary with my buddy
[3:00:12.800 --> 3:00:13.800]  Joey.
[3:00:13.800 --> 3:00:16.800]  We're not going to say his last name so secret who he is, but he doesn't want to make it about
[3:00:16.800 --> 3:00:17.800]  him.
[3:00:17.800 --> 3:00:18.800]  That's coming up next segment.
[3:00:18.800 --> 3:00:19.800]  You definitely want to stay with us.
[3:00:19.800 --> 3:00:23.520]  Dr. Peter Chambers is a medical doctor in the U.S. military, been a green beret and then
[3:00:23.520 --> 3:00:26.960]  of course run major operations around the world and has now in the last 10 months been
[3:00:26.960 --> 3:00:30.320]  on the Texas board reporting on that nightmare, but you were talking during the break about
[3:00:30.320 --> 3:00:33.240]  false flags of January 6th and where you see this.
[3:00:33.240 --> 3:00:37.440]  How do we stop the deep state from staging things or provocaturing things and blaming
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:41.960]  on this movement to discredit Americana during this globalist takeover?
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:42.960]  How do we take over?
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:44.480]  Two words, situational awareness.
[3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:49.320]  You've got to know that if I'm thinking about when I'm doing a military operation to plan,
[3:00:49.320 --> 3:00:53.560]  I think about the most dangerous course of action, the most dangerous course of action
[3:00:53.560 --> 3:00:55.560]  and the most likely course of action.
[3:00:55.560 --> 3:00:58.400]  The most dangerous would be that they're setting me up.
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:00.320]  That's the MD COA we call that.
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:02.120]  If I think that, then I've got to be looking for it.
[3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:05.320]  I've got to be looking for cues and indicators and that's where we get to that left to bang
[3:01:05.320 --> 3:01:06.760]  theory that I was talking about.
[3:01:06.760 --> 3:01:08.160]  I look for cues.
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:09.400]  There's something that's not right here.
[3:01:09.400 --> 3:01:11.120]  These guys are all wearing 5'11 pants.
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:16.840]  They all got the same kind of sun to watch on and they're supposedly a rioter out here.
[3:01:16.840 --> 3:01:19.480]  And they're doing that to identify each other?
[3:01:19.480 --> 3:01:20.480]  Absolutely.
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:21.480]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:01:21.480 --> 3:01:25.560]  And I've done those kind of operations downrange where I've had to infiltrate using, I mean,
[3:01:25.560 --> 3:01:26.720]  look at me, I'm dark complexed.
[3:01:26.720 --> 3:01:31.000]  I got this beard and when it's bigger, I speak Farsi, Dari, Greek.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:33.960]  You know, I go to these places and sometimes I have to be seamless.
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:36.200]  And when I'm seamless, that doesn't change who I am inside.
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:38.880]  It allows me to walk down the street without them noticing me.
[3:01:38.880 --> 3:01:41.840]  All right, as a special operator, that's what I had to do.
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:45.080]  Now I'm looking at that and they stand out because they're cues and indicators.
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:51.000]  And so if you're seeing this and you want to go to a rally or something, be careful.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:52.160]  Measure twice, cut once.
[3:01:52.160 --> 3:01:53.280]  There you go.
[3:01:53.280 --> 3:01:54.680]  Measure twice, cut once.
[3:01:54.680 --> 3:01:55.920]  Understand your situational awareness.
[3:01:55.920 --> 3:01:56.920]  Look around.
[3:01:56.920 --> 3:01:59.360]  If you think you're going to get thrown on the bus for something you didn't do, look
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:00.960]  at these poor people sitting in a jail.
[3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:02.440]  What's the deal with that?
[3:02:02.440 --> 3:02:03.440]  These Americans, they were up there.
[3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:05.560]  They got these jerks to set them up.
[3:02:05.560 --> 3:02:06.560]  Right.
[3:02:06.560 --> 3:02:11.840]  So if you don't want to get rolled up for something that you're not guilty of, then
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:13.360]  pay attention to your surroundings.
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:16.040]  Well, my guys were warning me and I was like, oh, Trump has rallies.
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:17.040]  It's fine.
[3:02:17.040 --> 3:02:19.760]  I was using the fact that past events have been peaceful.
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:20.760]  This was the big event.
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:22.520]  Obviously we walked right into a trap.
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:29.280]  Yeah, so the trap was set and if you trust and sometimes we trust, but you got to verify.
[3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:31.480]  Trust, but verify.
[3:02:31.480 --> 3:02:32.480]  And perception is real.
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:35.280]  That's not the reason the Secret Service jammed all the cell phones that day.
[3:02:35.280 --> 3:02:36.280]  I didn't know that.
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:41.320]  In fact, it wasn't just, they even turned the cable off in the hotel.
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:43.000]  It was like nothing was on.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:44.560]  Well, there you go.
[3:02:44.560 --> 3:02:46.480]  They did their homework, you know.
[3:02:46.480 --> 3:02:47.480]  They set it up.
[3:02:47.480 --> 3:02:50.000]  If that's what their intent was, then they succeeded.
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:53.720]  Well, they even came and visited us at like 7 a.m. at the hotel.
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:02:54.720]  Really?
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:02:55.720]  Yeah, the feds.
[3:02:55.720 --> 3:02:56.720]  And they're like, oh, who are you guys?
[3:02:56.720 --> 3:02:57.720]  Where are you?
[3:02:57.720 --> 3:03:01.640]  And it was like, of course, my guy saw the equipment and it was, you know, Pentagon
[3:03:01.640 --> 3:03:02.640]  stuff.
[3:03:02.640 --> 3:03:03.640]  Okay.
[3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:04.640]  Yeah.
[3:03:04.640 --> 3:03:05.640]  And that that's concerning to me.
[3:03:05.640 --> 3:03:09.600]  I don't, I don't like Pentagon being involved with what we call conus continental United
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:10.600]  States.
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:11.600]  Exactly.
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:12.600]  And that's what's in all the documents.
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:17.240]  That's the rollout of the new terrorism perspective, a new directive of June of Biden that it's
[3:03:17.240 --> 3:03:19.240]  the American people's the main enemy.
[3:03:19.240 --> 3:03:20.240]  You seen that?
[3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:21.240]  There you go.
[3:03:21.240 --> 3:03:22.240]  That's us.
[3:03:22.240 --> 3:03:23.240]  So we're the main enemy.
[3:03:23.240 --> 3:03:24.240]  Yep.
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:26.720]  Not China, not Russian, not al-Qaeda, Americans.
[3:03:26.720 --> 3:03:29.000]  If you disagree with someone, does that make you the enemy?
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  If you can't have a dialogue or a discourse?
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  Well, it shows how desperate they are.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:35.000]  America's waking up.
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:36.880]  That's why they want to trick us into violence.
[3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:39.000]  We need to do everything we can, even be Christlike.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:42.520]  Not that we're wimps right now, but, but it's actually stronger at this point.
[3:03:42.520 --> 3:03:44.760]  I think to not be tricked into violence.
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:47.040]  Well, Christ had righteous anger.
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:49.000]  So that's where we're at.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  Be Christlike.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:51.360]  You can have righteous anger about something.
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:52.360]  I agree.
[3:03:52.360 --> 3:03:53.360]  So when is the time to whip the money changers?
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:54.360]  Because I'm ready.
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:55.360]  Yeah.
[3:03:55.360 --> 3:03:56.360]  Turn the tables over.
[3:03:56.360 --> 3:04:00.240]  I mean, and when I was talking to those, once again, I'm bringing this up with the benefactors
[3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:06.840]  last night, when they ask me, what can I do, reach in your pocket and help somebody out.
[3:04:06.840 --> 3:04:10.400]  We don't expect you to get out there and knock on doors or do anything like that, but get
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:11.400]  out there and help financially.
[3:04:11.400 --> 3:04:12.960]  I totally agree.
[3:04:12.960 --> 3:04:15.400]  Everybody better be spending their money right now in the fight for freedom.
[3:04:15.400 --> 3:04:18.160]  You don't, your money will be worthless if you don't use it now.
[3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:19.320]  I brought that up last night.
[3:04:19.320 --> 3:04:22.720]  I looked at him and said, what, okay, what are you worth here?
[3:04:22.720 --> 3:04:25.560]  And I'd ask, just kidding with the guy, what, $11 billion?
[3:04:25.560 --> 3:04:29.920]  And I said, $11 billion is going to be nothing 10 years from now.
[3:04:29.920 --> 3:04:34.360]  If you don't fix the problem now, your grandchildren who are going to get vaccines are going to
[3:04:34.360 --> 3:04:37.240]  have the second and third order effects of those.
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:39.000]  And what are you going to do with that?
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  What's their joy?
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  What's their future?
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  I love our guests and I really like you.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:43.480]  I appreciate you coming in Dr. Peter Chambers.
[3:04:43.480 --> 3:04:45.280]  You have amazing website.
[3:04:45.280 --> 3:04:47.040]  People should visit it right now.
[3:04:47.040 --> 3:04:48.600]  That's fullspecialamerica.com.
[3:04:48.600 --> 3:04:49.600]  Thank you so much, brother.
[3:04:49.600 --> 3:04:50.600]  Yes, sir.
[3:04:50.600 --> 3:04:51.600]  Thank you.
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:52.600]  That's a great text.
[3:04:52.600 --> 3:04:53.600]  I'm proud of my state.
[3:04:53.600 --> 3:04:54.600]  We'll be right back.
[3:04:54.600 --> 3:04:57.200]  All right.
[3:04:57.200 --> 3:05:00.040]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[3:05:00.040 --> 3:05:04.760]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[3:05:04.760 --> 3:05:10.320]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:14.000]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:18.960]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[3:05:18.960 --> 3:05:23.160]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:26.840]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[3:05:26.840 --> 3:05:30.080]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[3:05:51.560 --> 3:05:53.560]  It's amazing.
[3:05:53.560 --> 3:06:07.480]  We're about to drop the hammer on the NWO.
[3:06:07.480 --> 3:06:14.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:14.040 --> 3:06:20.200]  The January 6th committee has been an exercise in armed political intimidation.
[3:06:20.200 --> 3:06:21.200]  How did it start?
[3:06:21.200 --> 3:06:22.720]  We've forgotten.
[3:06:22.720 --> 3:06:26.680]  Congress formed the committee after several members of the U.S. Capitol Police, the same
[3:06:26.680 --> 3:06:31.840]  people responsible for protecting members of Congress, anonymously commanded them to
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:32.840]  do it.
[3:06:32.840 --> 3:06:36.000]  So effectively, as a ransom note, prosecute our political opponents that's in order from
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  your bodyguards.
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:38.760]  Amazingly, they did it.
[3:06:38.760 --> 3:06:44.920]  So from the very first day, the January 6th committee was never about gathering information.
[3:06:44.920 --> 3:06:48.480]  Obviously, Congress already has the information.
[3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:52.640]  Nancy Pelosi knows exactly how many federal agents were in the crowd that day.
[3:06:52.640 --> 3:06:54.240]  She won't tell us.
[3:06:54.240 --> 3:06:58.280]  Pelosi could release thousands of hours of videotape evidence from January 6th.
[3:06:58.280 --> 3:07:00.160]  She refuses to do that.
[3:07:00.160 --> 3:07:02.280]  So whatever else this is, don't let them lie to you.
[3:07:02.280 --> 3:07:05.160]  This is not a fact-finding effort.
[3:07:05.160 --> 3:07:09.800]  This is a highly obvious attempt to punish critics of the Democratic Party, and for months,
[3:07:09.800 --> 3:07:12.480]  that's exactly what the committee has been doing.
[3:07:12.480 --> 3:07:16.520]  Using the pretext of January 6th, the Biden's Justice Department has indicted former Trump
[3:07:16.520 --> 3:07:18.520]  adviser Steve Bannon.
[3:07:18.520 --> 3:07:19.520]  What?
[3:07:19.520 --> 3:07:20.520]  What was his crime exactly?
[3:07:20.520 --> 3:07:22.960]  Oh, talking about election fraud on a radio show.
[3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:23.960]  That's illegal now.
[3:07:23.960 --> 3:07:27.760]  Pelosi's January 6th committee had him arrested.
[3:07:27.760 --> 3:07:33.000]  Liz Cheney, by the way, who is being used as a Republican cover for all of this, stood
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:34.440]  back and watched it happen.
[3:07:34.440 --> 3:07:39.000]  Liz Cheney should be ashamed, but she's become far too degraded for shame, unfortunately.
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:42.640]  And Bannon, by the way, is not the only prominent Republican who might go to jail.
[3:07:42.640 --> 3:07:46.880]  The committee has now subpoenaed several former Trump advisers, as well as the fiancé of
[3:07:46.880 --> 3:07:47.880]  another.
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:50.760]  They've even subpoenaed Roger Stone yet again.
[3:07:50.760 --> 3:07:52.400]  Where was Stone on January 6th?
[3:07:52.400 --> 3:07:55.240]  He was in a hotel room as the Capitol was being breached.
[3:07:55.240 --> 3:07:58.880]  He had literally nothing to do with it, but it doesn't matter.
[3:07:58.880 --> 3:08:00.240]  He's criticized Joe Biden.
[3:08:00.240 --> 3:08:02.320]  He could be going to jail again.
[3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:06.360]  Now the committees decide to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right,
[3:08:06.360 --> 3:08:07.360]  Alex Jones.
[3:08:07.360 --> 3:08:08.840]  Yes, journalists.
[3:08:08.840 --> 3:08:12.840]  Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance, but the truth is he has been a far better
[3:08:12.840 --> 3:08:15.120]  guide to reality in recent years.
[3:08:15.120 --> 3:08:20.040]  In other words, a far better journalist than, say, NBC News national security correspondent
[3:08:20.040 --> 3:08:24.120]  Ken Delanian or Margaret Brennan of CBS.
[3:08:24.120 --> 3:08:27.840]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[3:08:27.840 --> 3:08:31.800]  And if Jones sat down with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists
[3:08:31.800 --> 3:08:32.800]  are supposed to do.
[3:08:32.800 --> 3:08:35.440]  He wouldn't just slobber all over him.
[3:08:35.440 --> 3:08:39.480]  But Alex Jones makes fun of Joe Biden, so the January 6th committee is threatening him
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:40.960]  with prison.
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:45.240]  Now the irony here, and there are many layers of irony here, but the main one is that Alex
[3:08:45.240 --> 3:08:49.960]  Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[3:08:49.960 --> 3:08:55.280]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[3:08:55.280 --> 3:08:59.000]  We're not running interference for Alex Jones, and we're not guessing about it.
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:02.920]  We happen to know this for a fact, because we looked into it in some detail for Patriot
[3:09:02.920 --> 3:09:03.920]  Purge.
[3:09:03.920 --> 3:09:06.680]  It's a three-part documentary series on Fox Nation.
[3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:08.680]  Here are the facts.
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:16.600]  So, the Republican Party, I just want them to hear this message.
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:18.840]  Look at this crowd.
[3:09:18.840 --> 3:09:21.880]  We are the people that you must represent for real.
[3:09:21.880 --> 3:09:23.120]  January 6th was all about.
[3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:26.800]  It was just about making sure that if you called yourself a conservative that you stood
[3:09:26.800 --> 3:09:28.840]  with the conservative movement.
[3:09:28.840 --> 3:09:33.960]  And unfortunately, it spiraled out of control.
[3:09:33.960 --> 3:09:36.880]  We coordinated with the U.S. Capitol Police nearly every day.
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:40.960]  A lot of people don't know that stop the steal actually had a permit on the Capitol
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:41.960]  Ground.
[3:09:41.960 --> 3:09:46.760]  So, not the Capitol itself, and not the Capitol Plaza, the Capitol Ground's Law 8, we had
[3:09:46.760 --> 3:09:47.760]  a permit.
[3:09:47.760 --> 3:09:54.080]  So, let's just imagine this, 20,000 to 50,000 people inside the president's park.
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:09:55.280]  We're sitting there at the very front.
[3:09:55.280 --> 3:09:57.840]  I'm dead center of the president, front row.
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:01.880]  A Trump campaign staffer walks up to me and says, you know, I'll leave, there are people
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:08.640]  leaving the overflow, and there are already tens of thousands of people at the U.S. Capitol.
[3:10:08.640 --> 3:10:14.120]  With your presence and the presence of Alex Jones, why don't you guys walk down Pennsylvania,
[3:10:14.120 --> 3:10:20.480]  gather people together, and then position them for your rally on Law 8.
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:25.360]  I wasn't at the Capitol when it descended into chaos.
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:29.280]  And that's only by God's grace, because I was scheduled to be there.
[3:10:29.280 --> 3:10:32.600]  Secret Service let us out at a point where we would have been there when the first punch
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:35.880]  was thrown.
[3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:37.400]  And that's strange.
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:41.760]  The only reason that we weren't there is because we stopped and gave an impromptu speech.
[3:10:41.760 --> 3:10:47.920]  We're going to America, we're here to take our life, because we're back, we're sorry.
[3:10:47.920 --> 3:10:53.200]  I get a text from the campaign that you should get there and de-escalate because things are
[3:10:53.200 --> 3:10:58.280]  not going well.
[3:10:58.280 --> 3:11:04.080]  So we started to approach the side of the Capitol where no protests had happened in November,
[3:11:04.080 --> 3:11:06.680]  no protests had happened in December.
[3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:10.280]  All I thought was, I need to get them to the other side, and I need to get them to Law
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:11.280]  8.
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:13.440]  Let's march around to the other side.
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:15.880]  And all we have are equipped with are our megaphones.
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:19.440]  Let's not fight the police and get the system what they want.
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:22.200]  Maybe a thousand people are listening to us.
[3:11:22.200 --> 3:11:23.840]  Come out the stands.
[3:11:23.840 --> 3:11:27.840]  Add 75 to 100,000 people there in front of us.
[3:11:27.840 --> 3:11:29.840]  And it was a very helpless feeling.
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:34.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the confrontation with the police.
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:43.560]  We're going to make that the story.
[3:11:43.560 --> 3:11:44.560]  All right.
[3:11:44.560 --> 3:11:48.440]  I really appreciate Joey, who does want to make about himself.
[3:11:48.440 --> 3:11:50.320]  He knows his names out there with the government.
[3:11:50.320 --> 3:11:55.840]  He's Joey, Sergeant Major in the Army recently out this last year.
[3:11:55.840 --> 3:11:59.760]  And you know, they're with us because, you know, he doesn't work with us.
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:02.960]  And he was warning us the day before this looks bad.
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:06.040]  And then that morning, I'm just like, oh, we've had a bunch of Trump rallies.
[3:12:06.040 --> 3:12:07.040]  It'll be fine.
[3:12:07.040 --> 3:12:09.000]  Of course, there's feds crawling all over everything.
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:11.200]  But now we have this article.
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:15.720]  So now a lot of the things that are classified that he can't get into because he has national
[3:12:15.720 --> 3:12:16.720]  security clearances.
[3:12:16.720 --> 3:12:20.320]  So he can't even tell you what he knows if it's classified.
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:23.600]  And that was the problem with a lot of my security was, you know, they all, a lot of
[3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:25.480]  them still do stuff with the government.
[3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:26.640]  But now it's in the news.
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:28.640]  So now he can talk more about that.
[3:12:28.640 --> 3:12:34.200]  He'll be very careful and be very specific, but exclusive secret commandos will shoot
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:35.200]  to kill authority.
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:36.200]  We're at the capital.
[3:12:36.200 --> 3:12:37.200]  It's come out in federal documents.
[3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:39.040]  It's not come out in the Jan 6 committee.
[3:12:39.040 --> 3:12:41.520]  They don't want this information out.
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:47.160]  But there wasn't just a 350 man hostage rescue team, which a bunch of military commandos
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:48.160]  in the FBI.
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:54.120]  It was a bunch of other groups and Joey, the night before and the morning was frantically
[3:12:54.120 --> 3:12:57.600]  warning people saying they're setting something up, something's going on.
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:12:58.960]  We got to get over there.
[3:12:58.960 --> 3:13:02.160]  They're already, they're, they're planning something and we're like, okay, yeah, great.
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:07.160]  I'm sure the secret service and Trump will handle it because we were deferring to that.
[3:13:07.160 --> 3:13:08.440]  But this was all a giant setup.
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:15.440]  So this is huge because it's now come out that thousands of feds paramilitary were there
[3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:18.760]  watching a few dozen people with Ray Epps.
[3:13:18.760 --> 3:13:23.480]  I've got all the clips right here that we're saying burn down the capital, attack the capital,
[3:13:23.480 --> 3:13:26.760]  storm the capital with antifa operatives like Jade next.
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:34.560]  And then there's thousands, thousands of federal commandos all over the place doing
[3:13:34.560 --> 3:13:37.720]  nothing and now admitting it in federal filings.
[3:13:37.720 --> 3:13:38.800]  This is incredible.
[3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:40.320]  And Trump asked for the National Guard out.
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:45.240]  He was refused by the District of Columbia and he could override that but Milley said
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:46.240]  he would resign.
[3:13:46.240 --> 3:13:47.240]  Remember?
[3:13:47.240 --> 3:13:50.720]  If Trump called out the military, he said, we don't have the military on the streets
[3:13:50.720 --> 3:13:51.720]  of America.
[3:13:51.720 --> 3:13:53.240]  We're not for martial law.
[3:13:53.240 --> 3:13:54.240]  Remember that?
[3:13:54.240 --> 3:13:58.400]  So Trump thought everything was handled.
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:01.000]  It wasn't, we let a million people have an event.
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:05.400]  We let them hijack them and wave them in with their flags and say attack and all of it.
[3:14:05.400 --> 3:14:08.560]  So we're going to go to break, we're going to go right back to Joey on the other side
[3:14:08.560 --> 3:14:13.080]  because I don't want to cut him short for the next three segments, the next 45 minutes.
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:14.280]  But this is a big, big deal.
[3:14:14.280 --> 3:14:16.240]  We'll go to Joey right now for a minute and a half.
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:22.360]  Joey, just as an American citizen, obviously we talked again this morning.
[3:14:22.360 --> 3:14:23.960]  You said this was a setup.
[3:14:23.960 --> 3:14:25.560]  We walked right into it.
[3:14:25.560 --> 3:14:30.280]  In 60 seconds, how would you quantify what happened one year ago tomorrow?
[3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:33.280]  I think one year ago today, first off, happy new year.
[3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:34.600]  It's good to talk to you.
[3:14:34.600 --> 3:14:40.040]  I think what happened one year ago today was they saw a million red-blooded Americans
[3:14:40.040 --> 3:14:45.760]  show up to more than one event and they knew they could not stop that level of support.
[3:14:45.760 --> 3:14:52.160]  So they pre-staged a way to control the outcome with pre-plotted narratives and everyone walked
[3:14:52.160 --> 3:14:53.920]  right into it.
[3:14:53.920 --> 3:14:55.840]  Perfectly said.
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:14:58.880]  And you agree with me that they're clearly creating the narrative that we're quote about
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:02.880]  to attack again when obviously we don't have the motive, we don't want to, that's the last
[3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:04.880]  thing we want.
[3:15:04.880 --> 3:15:05.880]  Absolutely.
[3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:09.680]  No one, matter of fact, as we get through our segment, you'll see one of the clips I
[3:15:09.680 --> 3:15:15.560]  sent where people were peacefully dispersing the area without anything because they didn't
[3:15:15.560 --> 3:15:16.920]  want to be involved in violence.
[3:15:16.920 --> 3:15:18.880]  That wasn't what we were there for.
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:23.560]  All right, Joey, and literally we may have to do a part two on this tomorrow too because
[3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:28.840]  I've got, you sent me 14 clips and I've got 10 here from Rob Do.
[3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:31.000]  So we're going to try to, we got proof of all this folks.
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:34.760]  We have them red-handed, the feds with flags waving them in.
[3:15:34.760 --> 3:15:35.760]  None of them are being arrested.
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:39.520]  None are being investigated because they're federal agents and we know who they are, by
[3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:40.520]  the way.
[3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:43.960]  And so it's reached the point of it's too dangerous to not expose this now.
[3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:47.280]  It was dangerous before to expose it, but now it's too dangerous not to expose it.
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:48.600]  They'll be right back to stay with us.
[3:15:48.600 --> 3:15:51.400]  This is exposing the next big false flag that's coming.
[3:15:51.400 --> 3:15:55.840]  This is so important.
[3:15:55.840 --> 3:15:58.040]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[3:15:58.040 --> 3:15:59.640]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[3:15:59.640 --> 3:16:02.880]  Why do they hate America so much?
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:08.720]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot
[3:16:08.720 --> 3:16:09.720]  coexist with.
[3:16:09.720 --> 3:16:10.880]  It's very, very simple.
[3:16:10.880 --> 3:16:17.560]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenics system to flourish.
[3:16:17.560 --> 3:16:23.560]  Freedom and liberty and new process, injustice and God fearing systems must fail.
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:26.080]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[3:16:26.080 --> 3:16:29.080]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[3:16:29.080 --> 3:16:30.960]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[3:16:30.960 --> 3:16:33.360]  They started a fight with you.
[3:16:33.360 --> 3:16:37.760]  And they're not going to back down and they're not going to go away and they're not going
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:43.160]  to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[3:16:43.160 --> 3:16:47.240]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism
[3:16:47.240 --> 3:16:48.240]  or about corporate fascism.
[3:16:48.240 --> 3:16:53.000]  And it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack that we have any
[3:16:53.000 --> 3:16:55.440]  chance of beating these people.
[3:16:55.440 --> 3:16:59.800]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in M4's live products.
[3:16:59.800 --> 3:17:03.440]  And that's why for more than two years, we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[3:17:03.440 --> 3:17:06.920]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[3:17:06.920 --> 3:17:11.200]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and
[3:17:11.200 --> 3:17:13.000]  made them even stronger.
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:16.640]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[3:17:16.640 --> 3:17:18.160]  Let's know what it's got in it.
[3:17:18.160 --> 3:17:23.200]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[3:17:23.200 --> 3:17:28.120]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[3:17:28.120 --> 3:17:32.720]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[3:17:32.720 --> 3:17:36.280]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[3:17:36.280 --> 3:17:37.280]  added.
[3:17:37.280 --> 3:17:39.320]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[3:17:39.320 --> 3:17:43.760]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[3:17:43.760 --> 3:17:44.760]  of sea salt.
[3:17:44.760 --> 3:17:45.760]  And it just goes on and on.
[3:17:45.760 --> 3:17:51.520]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off and free shipping
[3:17:51.520 --> 3:17:54.600]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:17:57.200]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:17:57.200 --> 3:17:59.200]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:17:59.200 --> 3:18:00.200]  Welcome.
[3:18:00.200 --> 3:18:01.200]  Hello, Alex.
[3:18:01.200 --> 3:18:02.200]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:18:02.200 --> 3:18:03.200]  All right.
[3:18:03.200 --> 3:18:05.200]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[3:18:05.200 --> 3:18:10.120]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[3:18:10.120 --> 3:18:12.880]  Supermal vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[3:18:12.880 --> 3:18:13.880]  Mix those two together.
[3:18:13.880 --> 3:18:15.880]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:17.440]  Supermal vitality really, really works.
[3:18:17.440 --> 3:18:22.360]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[3:18:22.360 --> 3:18:27.920]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[3:18:27.920 --> 3:18:28.920]  but just aren't as strong.
[3:18:28.920 --> 3:18:30.920]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:33.360]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:18:33.360 --> 3:18:34.360]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[3:18:34.360 --> 3:18:35.360]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:38.840]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[3:18:38.840 --> 3:18:39.840]  That's just how it is.
[3:18:39.840 --> 3:18:41.400]  It's how it works.
[3:18:41.400 --> 3:18:43.000]  So it's always good.
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:45.160]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:18:45.160 --> 3:18:55.440]  Yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:18:55.440 --> 3:18:58.240]  UN Run Contact Tracers aren't coming.
[3:18:58.240 --> 3:19:03.400]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[3:19:03.400 --> 3:19:06.880]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:12.600]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[3:19:12.600 --> 3:19:13.600]  facilities.
[3:19:13.600 --> 3:19:18.040]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come
[3:19:18.040 --> 3:19:22.320]  and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:24.120]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[3:19:24.120 --> 3:19:28.360]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:32.640]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[3:19:32.640 --> 3:19:35.240]  grade at infowarstore.com.

[3:19:57.440 --> 3:20:13.240]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:13.240 --> 3:20:19.000]  All right, Joey is one of our security guys.
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:23.680]  He's also somebody I work with in business, good friend of mine.
[3:20:23.680 --> 3:20:33.960]  And he was to help them do security for us on January 6, 364 days ago, 365 tomorrow.
[3:20:33.960 --> 3:20:42.040]  And I remember the day before and in the morning, he was saying, listen, this place is crawling
[3:20:42.040 --> 3:20:46.280]  with a bunch of special operations people, you name it, different agencies, something
[3:20:46.280 --> 3:20:47.280]  big is going down.
[3:20:47.280 --> 3:20:49.680]  This isn't normal.
[3:20:49.680 --> 3:20:51.640]  And then it just got crazier from there.
[3:20:51.640 --> 3:20:54.080]  We had the feds come visit our hotel that morning.
[3:20:54.080 --> 3:20:55.080]  And again, I just get oblivious.
[3:20:55.080 --> 3:20:58.600]  I'm like, okay, yeah, whatever, I'm doing this event.
[3:20:58.600 --> 3:21:02.080]  And then Joey's trying to text us, he can't get through because everything's blocked.
[3:21:02.080 --> 3:21:05.920]  Hey, you need to get down here while Trump's speaking, they're already attacking the Capitol.
[3:21:05.920 --> 3:21:08.840]  So they could then blame the whole hour and a half attack on him, even though most of
[3:21:08.840 --> 3:21:10.360]  it was while he was speaking.
[3:21:10.360 --> 3:21:13.600]  And so I'm a critic of Trump on many fronts, but not where he's innocent.
[3:21:13.600 --> 3:21:15.320]  He definitely got set up here.
[3:21:15.320 --> 3:21:18.040]  So Joey, start here in the next second, we'll get a bunch of clips.
[3:21:18.040 --> 3:21:22.720]  We've got a lot of ground to cover here, but you want to get, you know, 10 feet off the
[3:21:22.720 --> 3:21:26.960]  ground of 10,000 feet off the ground, where do you want to start first with what happened
[3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:27.960]  that day?
[3:21:27.960 --> 3:21:32.440]  Because now it's in the news, it's in federal court, it's come out that thousands of feds
[3:21:32.440 --> 3:21:35.000]  were running around watching everything.
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:40.200]  They knew it was happening and they did nothing to stop it, even though they were there and
[3:21:40.200 --> 3:21:46.920]  they called the regular Capitol police off, half of them to go do crowd control and traffic
[3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:47.920]  control.
[3:21:47.920 --> 3:21:53.640]  So, I mean, this is very clear, this is a big deal now.
[3:21:53.640 --> 3:21:59.000]  I think what's important is we talk from our, our view, which is 10 feet.
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:04.000]  And as we connect some dots, we can get to that 10,000 foot view, which I think is important
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:11.160]  for viewers to see what our near peer adversarial agenda is and how this all ties together.
[3:22:11.160 --> 3:22:16.800]  A lot of what Dr. Peter Chambers just mentioned is the exact same lexicon, it's the exact
[3:22:16.800 --> 3:22:20.800]  same stuff that some of it we're going to talk about, it's the same language, he knows,
[3:22:20.800 --> 3:22:21.800]  he gets it.
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:28.400]  Well, lay it out, Joey, tell us what you witnessed on January 6th, this is important with these
[3:22:28.400 --> 3:22:29.400]  new admissions.
[3:22:29.400 --> 3:22:34.440]  Yeah, so I mean, I mean, let's just start early morning at that hotel.
[3:22:34.440 --> 3:22:40.720]  I mean, if you recall, we were eating breakfast and I mean, I don't know how much we want
[3:22:40.720 --> 3:22:45.160]  to discuss, but we were interrupted by someone that was trying to derail us immediately from
[3:22:45.160 --> 3:22:47.240]  that morning.
[3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:51.640]  But after breakfast, we sat outside and just like Dr. Chambers was saying, when you've
[3:22:51.640 --> 3:22:58.560]  worked a lifetime in this arena, you can pick out people easily and vice versa.
[3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:03.960]  So when me and a couple of the other security guys were standing out front, I noticed a team
[3:23:03.960 --> 3:23:08.560]  of three individuals carrying some equipment, which I completely recognized and I know what
[3:23:08.560 --> 3:23:09.880]  it's used for.
[3:23:09.880 --> 3:23:14.400]  And we kind of made eye contact and they walked over and said, who are you guys with?
[3:23:14.400 --> 3:23:17.880]  So it's kind of like, you recognize each other, right?
[3:23:17.880 --> 3:23:21.960]  And we explained, they were here with Alex Jones, where's personal security detail.
[3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:25.960]  And they explained at that time that they were with the Secret Service.
[3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:31.360]  It appeared to me, in my opinion, what was a tactical level signal intelligence team.
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:32.360]  And I was like, great.
[3:23:32.360 --> 3:23:36.200]  And we de-conflicted and we told them what kind of what our plans for the day were.
[3:23:36.200 --> 3:23:41.520]  And they were like, great, no, glad that we're all on the same team and sounds good.
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:45.360]  And then from there is when the morning started, right?
[3:23:45.360 --> 3:23:51.600]  So all of that context from that morning and even the night prior, I was always kind of
[3:23:51.600 --> 3:23:54.080]  just trying to keep my finger on the pulse.
[3:23:54.080 --> 3:23:58.120]  And no matter where you go, what city, what state, what country, just talk to people.
[3:23:58.120 --> 3:24:02.080]  When you have good narrative, when you have good dialect, people will talk, they'll tell
[3:24:02.080 --> 3:24:07.760]  you kind of conditions and situational awareness that's going on, which gives you better context.
[3:24:07.760 --> 3:24:12.840]  That context gives you the ability to make proactive, deliberate decision making, right?
[3:24:12.840 --> 3:24:15.520]  Night cognitive power, so to speak.
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:21.680]  So from the night prior and that morning, it was clearly evident to me that in addition
[3:24:21.680 --> 3:24:26.360]  to a lot of what you're seeing in that article, and I want to kind of take our time as we
[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:29.240]  go through it, isn't really crazy.
[3:24:29.240 --> 3:24:32.160]  That's very standard, to be honest.
[3:24:32.160 --> 3:24:37.440]  And what's standard about it is, when you have that many people in one place at a time,
[3:24:37.440 --> 3:24:39.320]  it's obviously a target, right?
[3:24:39.320 --> 3:24:42.360]  It's a target for terrorism, it's a target for many things.
[3:24:42.360 --> 3:24:50.080]  So to deploy that level of assets at an environment like that is completely standard operating
[3:24:50.080 --> 3:24:51.080]  procedure.
[3:24:51.080 --> 3:24:58.000]  I think what's critical for people to understand is, you have winning and unwitting partners
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:24:59.960]  when you're conducting operations, right?
[3:24:59.960 --> 3:25:03.880]  Some people know it all, some people have no idea, they're just participating.
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:09.480]  You can look back in history of warfare dating as far back as books read about the winning
[3:25:09.480 --> 3:25:13.320]  and unwitting partners, you know, where people completely think, I mean, shit, I'll give
[3:25:13.320 --> 3:25:14.320]  you an example.
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:18.040]  When we invaded Iraq, there was an entire division that was supposed to land in the port
[3:25:18.040 --> 3:25:19.440]  of Turkey.
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:24.320]  Every single soldier that was headed to Turkey on those boats believed in their heart.
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:26.480]  They were coming to invade Iraq through Turkey.
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:31.760]  Well, it's now been declassified that that was a completely a deception campaign.
[3:25:31.760 --> 3:25:36.480]  But if they were winning, how do you think, how successful do you think that would have
[3:25:36.480 --> 3:25:37.480]  been?
[3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:41.000]  It probably wouldn't have been because people can't keep their mouth shut, right?
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:44.920]  But because they were unwitting, it was tremendously successful.
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:45.920]  Does that make sense?
[3:25:45.920 --> 3:25:46.920]  100%.
[3:25:46.920 --> 3:25:52.400]  So please continue, because clearly they're trying to rebrand January 6 as the American
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:53.400]  people are terrorists.
[3:25:53.400 --> 3:25:56.600]  We got to arrest them all and take all their freedoms and have the military declare martial
[3:25:56.600 --> 3:25:57.600]  law.
[3:25:57.600 --> 3:26:01.640]  And that's what we do is that a civil war is here that we attack the capital when instead,
[3:26:01.640 --> 3:26:06.000]  the feds provocateur in it basically were there watching everything that happened, total
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:08.920]  proof that they bear minimum, let it unfold.
[3:26:08.920 --> 3:26:09.920]  Yeah.
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:17.960]  So I would highlight in that scenario, the decision makers, not necessarily the boots
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:18.960]  on the ground.
[3:26:18.960 --> 3:26:19.960]  They don't know either.
[3:26:19.960 --> 3:26:20.960]  They're compartmentalized.
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:22.520]  It's like they think they're invaded Turkey.
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:23.520]  They're not.
[3:26:23.520 --> 3:26:25.400]  Who gave those orders?
[3:26:25.400 --> 3:26:26.400]  Exactly.
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:31.880]  So I think, and more importantly, who did not give orders is I think is really where
[3:26:31.880 --> 3:26:36.520]  the root cause of that problem is because I think that's what identifies who is the
[3:26:36.520 --> 3:26:40.480]  winning partner of the opposing agenda.
[3:26:40.480 --> 3:26:46.160]  Because if the decision makers would have deployed the assets that were staged on site
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:53.280]  adequately or prematurely even as a force protection measure, January 6 would not have
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:57.560]  produced as much propaganda as the media cycle continues to propagate.
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:26:58.560]  Well, yeah.
[3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:01.540]  The bullet in the way you did this morning we were talking, I mean, this was their propaganda
[3:27:01.540 --> 3:27:03.560]  victory, their way to brand all this.
[3:27:03.560 --> 3:27:07.320]  They had thousands of commandos there who couldn't stop maybe a hundred people trying
[3:27:07.320 --> 3:27:08.320]  to break it at the start.
[3:27:08.320 --> 3:27:09.800]  No, they, they overwatched it.
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:12.840]  They let it take place and they were there.
[3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:15.920]  Once I guess Pelosi got kidnapped, then they didn't be the saviors.
[3:27:15.920 --> 3:27:16.920]  Yeah.
[3:27:16.920 --> 3:27:20.480]  So I think, you know, kind of what we were talking about and really what we've talked
[3:27:20.480 --> 3:27:26.520]  about all year was, I mean, a lot of these narratives and just like Dr. Chambers talked
[3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:31.240]  about with information warfare and psychological warfare, a lot of these narratives have been
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:33.320]  pre-staged and pre-can.
[3:27:33.320 --> 3:27:38.320]  So when you have action, you have to have narratives and vice versa for it to be plausible.
[3:27:38.320 --> 3:27:41.760]  So if you have a narrative with no action, well, it's not plausible.
[3:27:41.760 --> 3:27:45.400]  Or if you have action with no narrative, well, you, you leave that for someone else to tell
[3:27:45.400 --> 3:27:46.480]  the story.
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:53.120]  So I think a lot of that was pre-staged simply because we attended several rallies leading
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:27:55.200]  up to January 6th.
[3:27:55.200 --> 3:28:01.120]  So there's no doubt, I mean, no brain surgeon or doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure
[3:28:01.120 --> 3:28:06.280]  out how many people were going to descend upon Washington, D.C. on January 6th.
[3:28:06.280 --> 3:28:09.720]  I mean, I could do a Google search and find out that hotels were sold out.
[3:28:09.720 --> 3:28:11.080]  There was no plane tickets.
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:14.280]  So that's at the very lowest civil level.
[3:28:14.280 --> 3:28:18.920]  Not alone, the intelligence agencies, I have no doubt that they knew exactly how many people
[3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:19.920]  were going to be present.
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:23.680]  And then they blocked Trump having National Guard and cut the Capitol Police by half.
[3:28:23.680 --> 3:28:26.240]  I mean, that's, that's, that's super obvious.
[3:28:26.240 --> 3:28:29.600]  We're going to come back and talk about that with all the evidence of what really happened
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:34.080]  on January 6th and why they're getting ready for big false flags to blame us in the next
[3:28:34.080 --> 3:28:36.720]  300 and seven days ahead of the midterms.
[3:28:36.720 --> 3:28:39.560]  They never intend on us having those free elections.
[3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:44.320]  They are going to brand us all as terrorists and bring an even more censorship and control.
[3:28:44.320 --> 3:28:49.960]  Our country is on its deathbed, but we can rise like the phoenix if we awaken to these
[3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:50.960]  facts.
[3:28:50.960 --> 3:28:51.960]  Stay with us.
[3:28:51.960 --> 3:28:54.960]  Black Don the Rollin.
[3:28:54.960 --> 3:29:00.440]  Get our great bag of it here.
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:04.680]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[3:29:04.680 --> 3:29:09.840]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:12.440]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:15.920]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[3:29:15.920 --> 3:29:17.200]  but really they're just a commune.
[3:29:17.200 --> 3:29:20.200]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[3:29:20.200 --> 3:29:22.400]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:29:22.400 --> 3:29:25.600]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[3:29:25.600 --> 3:29:26.760]  and the price has never gone up.
[3:29:26.760 --> 3:29:31.160]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[3:29:31.160 --> 3:29:33.680]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[3:29:33.680 --> 3:29:38.680]  Let's wake up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally, in fact, I'm
[3:29:38.680 --> 3:29:41.680]  not going to tell you a little story.
[3:29:41.680 --> 3:29:43.680]  We had like that.
[3:29:43.680 --> 3:29:45.680]  You wouldn't believe it.
[3:29:45.680 --> 3:29:49.800]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:29:49.800 --> 3:29:56.000]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[3:29:56.000 --> 3:30:02.760]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[3:30:02.760 --> 3:30:09.160]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[3:30:09.160 --> 3:30:12.240]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:30:12.240 --> 3:30:15.280]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[3:30:15.280 --> 3:30:16.280]  have.
[3:30:16.280 --> 3:30:21.000]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:23.280]  self-defense and a relationship with God.
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:26.760]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[3:30:26.760 --> 3:30:30.080]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[3:30:30.080 --> 3:30:35.520]  It's high quality, it's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future you're
[3:30:35.520 --> 3:30:39.960]  going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases
[3:30:39.960 --> 3:30:41.480]  that are already taking place.
[3:30:41.480 --> 3:30:47.780]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:47.780 --> 3:30:52.400]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:55.800]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:55.800 --> 3:31:00.640]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[3:31:00.640 --> 3:31:02.680]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:31:02.680 --> 3:31:08.360]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[3:31:08.360 --> 3:31:09.360]  But we failed.
[3:31:09.360 --> 3:31:10.840]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:31:10.840 --> 3:31:16.640]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[3:31:16.640 --> 3:31:19.000]  deindustrialization great reset.
[3:31:19.000 --> 3:31:23.280]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[3:31:23.280 --> 3:31:27.880]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:31:27.880 --> 3:31:31.200]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[3:31:31.200 --> 3:31:34.520]  We've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is
[3:31:34.520 --> 3:31:35.680]  high quality storeable food.
[3:31:35.680 --> 3:31:40.720]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:40.720 --> 3:31:44.760]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[3:31:44.760 --> 3:31:46.400]  to ship right now.
[3:31:46.400 --> 3:31:51.120]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits
[3:31:51.120 --> 3:31:53.560]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:31:53.560 --> 3:31:56.320]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:56.320 --> 3:32:01.200]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what
[3:32:01.200 --> 3:32:03.160]  the globalists are doing right now.
[3:32:03.160 --> 3:32:04.880]  This is their big offensive.
[3:32:04.880 --> 3:32:06.320]  This is their takeover.
[3:32:06.320 --> 3:32:10.280]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[3:32:10.280 --> 3:32:14.320]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[3:32:14.320 --> 3:32:15.320]  in the open.
[3:32:15.320 --> 3:32:19.840]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[3:32:19.840 --> 3:32:24.120]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[3:32:24.120 --> 3:32:27.400]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[3:32:27.400 --> 3:32:29.520]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[3:32:29.520 --> 3:32:33.200]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.
[3:32:33.200 --> 3:32:36.360]  Plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock
[3:32:36.360 --> 3:32:40.400]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[3:32:40.400 --> 3:32:43.440]  Both of these are in our top five best sellers that are so good for your body.
[3:32:43.440 --> 3:32:47.120]  And if there's two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[3:32:47.120 --> 3:32:51.760]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[3:32:51.760 --> 3:32:57.800]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[3:32:57.800 --> 3:33:09.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:09.960 --> 3:33:15.320]  We are on the march, the globalist empire is on the run, and it's counter offensive
[3:33:15.320 --> 3:33:17.320]  and is the great reset.
[3:33:17.320 --> 3:33:22.800]  Resistance to tyrants, his obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:22.800 --> 3:33:28.920]  Okay, so Joey did security work with us, he's a great patriot, army veteran, and he was
[3:33:28.920 --> 3:33:33.000]  there the one warning that day, hey, this is a setup, and he's like, hey, you got to
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:36.080]  get down there, they're starting violence, we got to stop it, so we were already hurrying
[3:33:36.080 --> 3:33:39.800]  to get there, and then we got there in the middle of it, and said, hey, we don't want
[3:33:39.800 --> 3:33:43.720]  a new Ken State, come out, everybody's seeing the video.
[3:33:43.720 --> 3:33:47.960]  And yeah, you got apps and all these other folks out there saying attack the Capitol
[3:33:47.960 --> 3:33:51.400]  and they haven't been arrested or indicted, I mean, all this is very obvious, but now
[3:33:51.400 --> 3:33:55.920]  we know a whole bunch of federal agencies were there with paramilitary and plain clothes
[3:33:55.920 --> 3:34:02.520]  just as Tucker Carlson said months ago, and they stood down and did nothing, and then
[3:34:02.520 --> 3:34:07.760]  we even have footage that we'll probably tag on at the end of the show that Joey shot
[3:34:07.760 --> 3:34:14.160]  from on top of the building we'd rented where the media, the left spends it, why'd they
[3:34:14.160 --> 3:34:18.720]  have a building over the Capitol, we'd rented it many times before, that's where everybody
[3:34:18.720 --> 3:34:23.760]  else rents the media, there's like 20, 30, 40 media crews up there, but again, the left
[3:34:23.760 --> 3:34:29.320]  just lies at every level, and we can see the hostage rescue team or the FBI actually attacking
[3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:32.160]  the last people that were still at the Capitol that evening.
[3:34:32.160 --> 3:34:35.040]  So Joey, let's just cover the waterfront right now, I've got a bunch of these clips,
[3:34:35.040 --> 3:34:40.160]  if you call for them, we can go to them, but just with your training and your background
[3:34:40.160 --> 3:34:44.840]  and the groups you saw, and I know the folks you talked to, you talked to them, of what
[3:34:44.840 --> 3:34:50.640]  was really going on, bare minimum they knew were ordered to stand out.
[3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:55.600]  So right, but real quick, like you were just saying how they spend shit and talk about
[3:34:55.600 --> 3:35:02.000]  why did they have a rooftop, well, let's think about that, every major media outlet was on
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:09.600]  that rooftop with us, along with an ATF sniper team, so we all had the same rooftop, you
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:16.200]  know what I mean, to get the right perspective and view of the backdrop to report accurately.
[3:35:16.200 --> 3:35:18.280]  So why is that wrong, right?
[3:35:18.280 --> 3:35:21.640]  Why did they spin it differently for different organizations?
[3:35:21.640 --> 3:35:27.280]  It was media row, there was at least 10 tents, both that day and at the inauguration.
[3:35:27.280 --> 3:35:32.600]  Well, it just shows how they spin everything, like why are they on a rooftop, because it's
[3:35:32.600 --> 3:35:35.040]  where the media goes to rent a rooftop.
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:43.640]  Right, but in addition, there was an ATF special response team, sniper team, also on that rooftop
[3:35:43.640 --> 3:35:47.640]  with us.
[3:35:47.640 --> 3:35:49.120]  So please continue.
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:55.240]  I mean, so you kind of want to go over our timeline and then kind of dissect that report.
[3:35:55.240 --> 3:35:59.760]  Yeah, I mean, just the most important points to know that, again, the feds were there,
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:03.560]  they were there, they saw it all happen, they let it all happen, and that's why they don't
[3:36:03.560 --> 3:36:05.720]  want a real investigation in Congress.
[3:36:05.720 --> 3:36:14.520]  Yeah, I think kind of like we highlighted on our last trip to DC was there was multiple,
[3:36:14.520 --> 3:36:19.480]  so a lot of what you read in that article is very standard procedure, right?
[3:36:19.480 --> 3:36:24.960]  But most of those assets are designed to focus on high threat operations, which would be
[3:36:24.960 --> 3:36:30.360]  consistent with a lot of the terrorism threats that they probably saw.
[3:36:30.360 --> 3:36:35.800]  I mean, literally the night prior, we talked amongst our security team and I said, hey,
[3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:41.560]  you know, I think one of the most deadly courses of action that could happen would be some
[3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:47.880]  type of suicide bomb or IED from a terrorist standpoint, right?
[3:36:47.880 --> 3:36:50.640]  And so we predicted that and that in fact happened.
[3:36:50.640 --> 3:36:55.280]  And that's what a lot of those resources were a mass to address.
[3:36:55.280 --> 3:37:02.160]  Now when you get down to that tactical local municipal level, I feel like there was also
[3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:07.400]  multiple layers of force protection measures that were pre-staged.
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:13.600]  So literally when you go back today to the Capitol, the same fence that was put in place
[3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:18.840]  that night that was staged at least the day prior is still in place.
[3:37:18.840 --> 3:37:25.200]  Well, why wasn't that implemented prior to January 6th if intelligence or reporting or
[3:37:25.200 --> 3:37:32.320]  open source or any type of information would lead any decision makers to believe that there
[3:37:32.320 --> 3:37:36.600]  was in fact going to be some serious level of violence?
[3:37:36.600 --> 3:37:43.320]  You as a decision maker would pre-deploy those assets to mitigate any deadly or most likely
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:46.000]  course of action, but that didn't happen.
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:51.120]  What actually happened was right under our eyes from a bird's eye view on the OAM rooftop
[3:37:51.120 --> 3:37:57.680]  was we watched surrounding counties of additional security resources and force protection measures
[3:37:57.680 --> 3:38:06.320]  pour in after the propaganda footage was deployed, not prior to not to mitigate or deescalate
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:09.440]  after the fact, but they didn't come.
[3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:15.000]  When you look at the timeline, you physically cannot cover that amount of geographical land
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:17.720]  in the timeline of response.
[3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:20.280]  So they were pre-staged as that article said.
[3:38:20.280 --> 3:38:21.280]  That's right.
[3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:26.120]  They now admit that they pre-stage thousands and thousands of riot police from local governments
[3:38:26.120 --> 3:38:33.600]  and then they had hundreds and then they admit other groups, thousands of feds watching
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:37.800]  everything unfold, but then Trump got denied the National Guard he asked for.
[3:38:37.800 --> 3:38:42.840]  So they would draw the public security to invite provocateurs to be able to break into
[3:38:42.840 --> 3:38:46.280]  the Capitol and then as soon as they get the propaganda they want, then they shut it down
[3:38:46.280 --> 3:38:48.840]  and control it so it doesn't go too far.
[3:38:48.840 --> 3:38:49.840]  Absolutely.
[3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:56.560]  I mean, we can go back and just kind of start right at that morning.
[3:38:56.560 --> 3:39:01.560]  Early that morning, like I discussed previously, we had some conversation with three folks
[3:39:01.560 --> 3:39:05.800]  who identified themselves as part of Secret Service, cool, not for us to question.
[3:39:05.800 --> 3:39:10.400]  They actually did show us their ID cards as well and I showed them my retirement ID card
[3:39:10.400 --> 3:39:12.960]  and hey, glad we're all on the same team.
[3:39:12.960 --> 3:39:15.400]  We talked about our intent and what we were doing.
[3:39:15.400 --> 3:39:16.400]  All good.
[3:39:16.400 --> 3:39:17.400]  Thumbs up.
[3:39:17.400 --> 3:39:23.040]  And about, I would say eight o'clock is when we departed our hotel room to head on foot
[3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:27.760]  to the ellipse and after you, we split up.
[3:39:27.760 --> 3:39:33.000]  You went with a few people and then half of our team stayed back to just continue to plan
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:38.800]  and resource what we needed to for the next phase of what we had planned.
[3:39:38.800 --> 3:39:43.600]  At about nine o'clock, I snapped a picture in front of the ellipse after you guys had
[3:39:43.600 --> 3:39:47.600]  gained entry and it was very nostalgic for me.
[3:39:47.600 --> 3:39:51.880]  The best thing I've used to explain it to family and friends is it reminded me of the
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:57.960]  cliff in Forest Gump where all I could see as far as I could see was red, white and blue.
[3:39:57.960 --> 3:40:04.520]  I have never in my life been in a place with that many people with absolutely no violence.
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:05.520]  There was no argument.
[3:40:05.520 --> 3:40:12.200]  I mean, if you remember, Alex, we had to walk through probably a mile or more of people
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:17.200]  shoulder to shoulder and they parted ways to let you gain entry because they respected
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:18.200]  you.
[3:40:18.200 --> 3:40:19.200]  Exactly.
[3:40:19.200 --> 3:40:21.200]  And Roger Stone asked, people ask, why didn't Roger go?
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:23.200]  He couldn't get through the crowd.
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:24.200]  Yeah.
[3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:29.840]  I mean, it took us a better part of an hour to get you into the ellipse even though we
[3:40:29.840 --> 3:40:33.840]  were given special entry by Secret Service at different gates.
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:37.840]  When we went to those gates, it was kind of a little bit of run around, which happens,
[3:40:37.840 --> 3:40:42.960]  you know, when things like that occur, sometimes it's miscommunication or signals are jammed
[3:40:42.960 --> 3:40:43.960]  and things don't need to be copied.
[3:40:43.960 --> 3:40:47.120]  The bottom line is the feds knew what was going on.
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:51.440]  They had all the people in place and they sat there and watched the undermaned Capitol
[3:40:51.440 --> 3:40:55.960]  Police who'd been sent off to take care of traffic control being overrun and let it happen
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:40:56.960]  and they were there.
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:40:59.840]  And that narrative is not being discussed, but it's starting to come out.
[3:40:59.840 --> 3:41:03.600]  That's got to really concern the committee that's trying to act like the American people
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:05.880]  or President Trump wanted to attack the Capitol.
[3:41:05.880 --> 3:41:07.320]  That destroys their narrative.
[3:41:07.320 --> 3:41:08.320]  Absolutely.
[3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:16.160]  I mean, it's completely false because at like around 1130ish, me and another member
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:21.600]  from the security team went to the Capitol while you guys were still at the ellipse listening
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:27.440]  to Trump's speech so that we could locate the stage that we had pulled the permit for
[3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:30.520]  that was the intent, you know, following Trump's speech.
[3:41:30.520 --> 3:41:34.800]  We were all supposed to march to the Capitol and we had that permit for the stage for various
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:36.960]  key communicators to address the crowds.
[3:41:36.960 --> 3:41:43.480]  Well, when me and that member went at around 1130 to locate that stage, we only found the
[3:41:43.480 --> 3:41:48.760]  one stage and that looked like a Christian organization playing some music.
[3:41:48.760 --> 3:41:57.280]  But opposite of that, what I observed was about 20 folks in catcher's mitt equipment,
[3:41:57.280 --> 3:42:01.200]  you know, not your typical Trump supporter equipment, and I was conveying that to the
[3:42:01.200 --> 3:42:04.400]  team like this doesn't make sense to me.
[3:42:04.400 --> 3:42:10.320]  But a layer deeper, what I saw was Trump hat turned inside out or Trump t-shirts turned
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:11.480]  in reverse.
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:17.520]  And I feel that was a way of them clandestinely communicating with each other with in the
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:21.080]  aspect of, hey, I'm dressed to fit in.
[3:42:21.080 --> 3:42:26.360]  However, these subtle differences of where my hat inside out or my t-shirt backwards
[3:42:26.360 --> 3:42:31.000]  in fact, let the opposite agenda know, you know, who I really am.
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  And that was it about 11...
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:34.280]  100% Joey, stay there because we now know that's what happened.
[3:42:34.280 --> 3:42:38.240]  We had a video of them in the woods taking their anti of stuff off and putting it on,
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:39.240]  but they didn't...
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:43.320]  So, so they knew like, oh, they'll look like Trump supporters, red, white, and blue, but
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:44.640]  really it's turned inside out.
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:48.040]  What a premeditated action, we need to get this out now.
[3:42:48.040 --> 3:42:55.680]  We'll be right back once we're trying to stop the next big false flag.
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:43:01.840]  First 2021 is over, but you've still got a really great chance to give yourself the gift

[3:43:54.320 --> 3:43:56.040]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[3:43:56.040 --> 3:44:02.960]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[3:44:02.960 --> 3:44:08.000]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:12.160]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[3:44:12.160 --> 3:44:13.960]  And that's done by design.
[3:44:13.960 --> 3:44:20.000]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:24.040]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the sound of the Bilderberg
[3:44:24.040 --> 3:44:27.880]  group, the trilateral commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[3:44:27.880 --> 3:44:30.000]  and the Rockefellers.
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:34.240]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group didn't
[3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:35.240]  exist.
[3:44:35.240 --> 3:44:40.120]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head, still on the steering committee,
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:44.720]  is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[3:44:44.720 --> 3:44:49.880]  And as a Liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second
[3:44:49.880 --> 3:44:52.320]  thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[3:44:52.320 --> 3:44:53.320]  We don't have a shot.
[3:44:53.320 --> 3:44:55.680]  If you expose them, we can beat a measly.
[3:44:55.680 --> 3:45:00.520]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[3:45:00.520 --> 3:45:02.520]  the globalists are doing right now.
[3:45:02.520 --> 3:45:04.240]  This is their big offensive.
[3:45:04.240 --> 3:45:05.680]  This is their takeover.
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:09.640]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[3:45:09.640 --> 3:45:13.680]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[3:45:13.680 --> 3:45:14.680]  in the open.
[3:45:14.680 --> 3:45:19.200]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:23.480]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[3:45:23.480 --> 3:45:26.760]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[3:45:26.760 --> 3:45:28.600]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[3:45:28.600 --> 3:45:32.480]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.
[3:45:32.480 --> 3:45:36.080]  Plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[3:45:36.080 --> 3:45:39.720]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[3:45:39.720 --> 3:45:41.720]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers.
[3:45:41.720 --> 3:45:42.720]  They are so good for your body.
[3:45:42.720 --> 3:45:46.480]  And if there's two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:51.120]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[3:45:51.120 --> 3:45:55.320]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[3:45:55.320 --> 3:45:58.160]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[3:45:58.160 --> 3:46:02.560]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[3:46:02.560 --> 3:46:08.440]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[3:46:08.440 --> 3:46:12.120]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[3:46:12.120 --> 3:46:17.080]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[3:46:17.080 --> 3:46:21.200]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[3:46:21.200 --> 3:46:25.480]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[3:46:25.480 --> 3:46:28.160]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[3:47:12.040 --> 3:47:16.720]  Here's the bottom line, and we're going to add in post a bunch of these clips and things
[3:47:16.720 --> 3:47:17.720]  I have.
[3:47:17.720 --> 3:47:19.200]  I'm going to cover this more tomorrow as well.
[3:47:19.200 --> 3:47:22.640]  We're going to take this last 30 minutes or so and boil it down and then do a special
[3:47:22.640 --> 3:47:27.800]  report tomorrow, but the feds were there, thousands of them.
[3:47:27.800 --> 3:47:31.000]  Remember, Tigger Carlson's like, there were feds and formants inside.
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:32.120]  They knew what's happening.
[3:47:32.120 --> 3:47:33.120]  They didn't just know.
[3:47:33.120 --> 3:47:34.120]  They were all over the place.
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:35.120]  They watched it.
[3:47:35.120 --> 3:47:36.120]  They let it happen.
[3:47:36.120 --> 3:47:37.520]  They called off the regular police.
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:42.000]  We know they had federal provocateurs like Ray Epps and others in there doing it.
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:45.080]  And now people are like, okay, we know this happened a year ago.
[3:47:45.080 --> 3:47:50.880]  They're preparing new big events, saying off of January 6th that they are now going to
[3:47:50.880 --> 3:47:55.480]  use the military and the CIA against the American people, and that we're the main threat of
[3:47:55.480 --> 3:47:57.120]  the country.
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:48:01.920]  That is a criminal declaration of war against our country.
[3:48:01.920 --> 3:48:06.080]  And that's an admission of their evil intent, in my view, Joey.
[3:48:06.080 --> 3:48:13.840]  Oh, yeah, I mean, what I thought was interesting and what we essentially predicted the night
[3:48:13.840 --> 3:48:20.160]  prior was, you know, they can't control the positive outcome, right, of what was going
[3:48:20.160 --> 3:48:21.560]  to happen on January 6th.
[3:48:21.560 --> 3:48:27.280]  So they pre-staged the narratives and the actions to control, you know, their level
[3:48:27.280 --> 3:48:29.480]  of outcome to support their agenda.
[3:48:29.480 --> 3:48:35.720]  And what came out immediately after that is really what bothers me the most is that domestic
[3:48:35.720 --> 3:48:37.200]  terrorism narrative.
[3:48:37.200 --> 3:48:39.760]  Well, domestic terrorism has always been a threat.
[3:48:39.760 --> 3:48:45.480]  But when you start to roll the veteran populist and other, you know, small groups into that
[3:48:45.480 --> 3:48:49.760]  domestic terrorism narrative, to me, that's a real problem.
[3:48:49.760 --> 3:48:54.760]  And that lends the credibility to, you know, that 10,000-foot view that I've discussed
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:48:59.480]  with you before that I would love to, you know, kind of educate folks on as we tear
[3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:00.640]  this apart.
[3:49:00.640 --> 3:49:05.920]  Because I think that that's really what people need to be looking at is how does what's the
[3:49:05.920 --> 3:49:12.840]  current conditions today, how is that supporting that 10,000-foot view agenda and where does
[3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:13.840]  that lead us?
[3:49:13.840 --> 3:49:14.840]  Because it takes time.
[3:49:14.840 --> 3:49:19.560]  And in my opinion, this has been happening over about the last 10 years.
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:25.840]  We've been under adversarial unconventional warfare and it's a problem.
[3:49:25.840 --> 3:49:32.920]  But with that is, I feel we have been being baited into civil disobedience to equate to
[3:49:32.920 --> 3:49:39.480]  a civil war internally to beat ourselves up because our adversaries will never put a uniform
[3:49:39.480 --> 3:49:40.720]  soldier on our soil.
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:42.140]  It just won't happen.
[3:49:42.140 --> 3:49:44.280]  Our country is the best country in the world.
[3:49:44.280 --> 3:49:52.400]  We have the most prominent, you know, outfitted, incredible military apparatus in the world.
[3:49:52.400 --> 3:49:57.000]  So the only way to beat us is to force us to beat ourselves internally.
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:49:59.920]  Well, you can infiltrate government entities.
[3:49:59.920 --> 3:50:05.600]  You can infiltrate civil local entities that all create the conditions and environment that
[3:50:05.600 --> 3:50:10.880]  in fact equates to civil disobedience because it's Mazloky's hierarchy of needs to just
[3:50:10.880 --> 3:50:17.400]  do that, to combat logic with logic, right, for our quality of life.
[3:50:17.400 --> 3:50:23.480]  And that leads to essentially, you know, some, some aspects of civil war, the race baiting,
[3:50:23.480 --> 3:50:28.720]  all of these agendas and narratives that have unrolled over the last three to 10 years.
[3:50:28.720 --> 3:50:36.160]  I feel 100% our lockstep into an adversarial unconventional warfare campaign against our
[3:50:36.160 --> 3:50:43.080]  country to degrade us, to degrade our narrative, to grade who we are as the beacon of freedom.
[3:50:43.080 --> 3:50:48.200]  January 6th, and if you watch these videos of guys in black pushing citizens back to
[3:50:48.200 --> 3:50:51.840]  don't want to break the Capitol, they just act like police officers.
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:54.640]  I mean, these are like train lettuce thugs.
[3:50:54.640 --> 3:50:55.840]  You can see all the tactics.
[3:50:55.840 --> 3:50:56.840]  Yeah.
[3:50:56.840 --> 3:51:01.000]  I mean, so, you know, getting back to what we were talking about in that time, Jesus,
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:03.280]  man, I tell you, well, right.
[3:51:03.280 --> 3:51:08.920]  Well, what was funny is so when me and when we, you know, the other guy went to go look
[3:51:08.920 --> 3:51:13.600]  for that stage and do that, you know, kind of cursory view of the Capitol, that was about
[3:51:13.600 --> 3:51:14.600]  1130.
[3:51:14.600 --> 3:51:22.680]  I, in fact, got a picture at 1136 at the front of the Capitol and then at 1138 of the stage.
[3:51:22.680 --> 3:51:31.680]  It may be hard for viewers to see, but when you look at the picture of the 1136, if you
[3:51:31.680 --> 3:51:34.640]  zoom in, the stage is on the left.
[3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:39.320]  That's where the Christian group was, you know, singing and having a good time.
[3:51:39.320 --> 3:51:44.840]  But when you zoom in and look to the right, you will see a group of people massing.
[3:51:44.840 --> 3:51:50.840]  That is where I witnessed 100% those, that group of people that I said was dressed up
[3:51:50.840 --> 3:51:55.960]  like Trump supporters, but in an instant glimpse, I knew they were not Trump supporters.
[3:51:55.960 --> 3:51:57.480]  They were, in fact, opposite.
[3:51:57.480 --> 3:52:02.240]  They were just a bunch of posers and they were starting trouble at that time with Capitol
[3:52:02.240 --> 3:52:03.240]  police.
[3:52:03.240 --> 3:52:08.080]  And I don't know if you remember, but when we actually got to the Capitol later that
[3:52:08.080 --> 3:52:13.120]  afternoon, you interviewed a man almost in that exact same spot.
[3:52:13.120 --> 3:52:17.280]  Yeah, we're trying to find that footage and he said, listen, as soon as Trump announced,
[3:52:17.280 --> 3:52:20.440]  they were listening online, as soon as Trump announced he was going to go to the Capitol,
[3:52:20.440 --> 3:52:22.200]  they went, go, go, go.
[3:52:22.200 --> 3:52:23.200]  And that's when they all attacked.
[3:52:23.200 --> 3:52:24.200]  Exactly.
[3:52:24.200 --> 3:52:25.200]  Yeah.
[3:52:25.200 --> 3:52:26.200]  We're going to find that footage.
[3:52:26.200 --> 3:52:27.200]  Right.
[3:52:27.200 --> 3:52:32.600]  So that right there cooperates exactly what we were talking about leading up to that.
[3:52:32.600 --> 3:52:38.720]  That man was probably, I'd estimate, he was probably in his 60s, you know, good, good
[3:52:38.720 --> 3:52:39.720]  patriotic guy.
[3:52:39.720 --> 3:52:42.720]  He said, hey, me and my family been out here all day.
[3:52:42.720 --> 3:52:43.720]  It's been peaceful.
[3:52:43.720 --> 3:52:46.920]  It's been great until they showed up.
[3:52:46.920 --> 3:52:51.840]  And then he laid it out of when they got the phone call of the trigger to in fact attack
[3:52:51.840 --> 3:52:58.620]  Capitol police, which is an hour before a million people were a mile plus up the road
[3:52:58.620 --> 3:53:03.600]  at the ellipse listening to Trump speak.
[3:53:03.600 --> 3:53:08.040]  And again, no indictments, no arrests, the guys waving the flags, saying attack the Capitol
[3:53:08.040 --> 3:53:13.400]  or the people in black breaking in the same function black trying to beat up Trump supporters
[3:53:13.400 --> 3:53:17.280]  so they could because they were trying to stop them breaking in.
[3:53:17.280 --> 3:53:18.280]  Yeah.
[3:53:18.280 --> 3:53:23.120]  I mean, you know, I even asked the question, well, Joey, look at it, the cut of their jib
[3:53:23.120 --> 3:53:26.880]  as they say, because you can tell different groups and I'm not been the military like
[3:53:26.880 --> 3:53:28.900]  you, but I've learned to tell the difference.
[3:53:28.900 --> 3:53:31.240]  What are these guys look like to you?
[3:53:31.240 --> 3:53:34.560]  The ones in black breaking in the guys waving the flags waving folks in.
[3:53:34.560 --> 3:53:43.640]  They look kind of like cops to me or like feds, FBI, who do they look like to you?
[3:53:43.640 --> 3:53:48.760]  I mean, it's hard to say, Alex, to be honest, because they're not really that well organized,
[3:53:48.760 --> 3:53:53.360]  organized enough to say they showed up together, but, but still kind of very erratic in their
[3:53:53.360 --> 3:53:54.360]  behavior.
[3:53:54.360 --> 3:53:58.800]  Well, the group of people that I observed out front of the Capitol when I was going
[3:53:58.800 --> 3:54:03.920]  to look for the stage, um, first thing came to mind to me was some type of antifa type
[3:54:03.920 --> 3:54:04.920]  faction.
[3:54:04.920 --> 3:54:05.920]  Oh, they were there.
[3:54:05.920 --> 3:54:06.920]  Absolutely.
[3:54:06.920 --> 3:54:07.920]  They had orders.
[3:54:07.920 --> 3:54:08.920]  Yeah.
[3:54:08.920 --> 3:54:11.080]  What I've seen them dressed in leading up to this event, right?
[3:54:11.080 --> 3:54:15.200]  We witnessed they're always in that kind of, you know, ball catcher equipment, but I
[3:54:15.200 --> 3:54:16.200]  mean, none of them.
[3:54:16.200 --> 3:54:20.360]  We had a bunch of folks in the woods stripping off their black, putting on red, white, blue,
[3:54:20.360 --> 3:54:21.360]  but none of it was Trump years.
[3:54:21.360 --> 3:54:22.360]  They didn't actually buy it.
[3:54:22.360 --> 3:54:26.360]  It was all just stuff they bought at the local store that was that color.
[3:54:26.360 --> 3:54:27.360]  Absolutely.
[3:54:27.360 --> 3:54:32.840]  And I think, you know, and they all look like pedophile methods to me, uh, but, but, but
[3:54:32.840 --> 3:54:36.880]  again, some, yeah, some of these guys look like feds.
[3:54:36.880 --> 3:54:41.800]  I mean, oh, well, we know information has come out that there were, you know, from, from
[3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:45.800]  what I've seen online, you know, in some different articles, there has been information
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:49.720]  that's, that's come out about, you know, federal implants that were provocative tours.
[3:54:49.720 --> 3:54:50.960]  I mean, look, let's be honest.
[3:54:50.960 --> 3:54:55.880]  You could watch any documentary on Netflix, you know, every organization, Hell's Angels,
[3:54:55.880 --> 3:54:58.400]  you name it, they've all been infiltrated, right?
[3:54:58.400 --> 3:55:02.280]  So that goes back to the witting and unwitting partners.
[3:55:02.280 --> 3:55:06.520]  That organization may have not known they will infiltrate it, but more importantly, the
[3:55:06.520 --> 3:55:12.280]  people that infiltrated that organization, why did you not collapse it prior to violent
[3:55:12.280 --> 3:55:13.280]  activity?
[3:55:13.280 --> 3:55:17.960]  Why did you let it ensue to, in fact, gauge propaganda that you could exploit?
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:23.120]  Well, exactly, it's fine to infiltrate a criminal group, stop it, but not to lead it.
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:24.120]  Exactly.
[3:55:24.120 --> 3:55:28.800]  So those are the questions when I reverse engineered for myself that, that I asked myself.
[3:55:28.800 --> 3:55:33.280]  And let's not forget, we caught them red handed with the governor Whitmer to be kidnapping.
[3:55:33.280 --> 3:55:34.640]  That was run by the FBI.
[3:55:34.640 --> 3:55:35.640]  That was staged.
[3:55:35.640 --> 3:55:36.640]  It's crazy.
[3:55:36.640 --> 3:55:45.240]  And then, I mean, when you look to at our timeline, I couldn't convey a lot of what
[3:55:45.240 --> 3:55:51.120]  I was seeing to the rest of our security team that was with you, you know, a couple rows
[3:55:51.120 --> 3:55:54.640]  back from the president at the ellipse, because all signals were jammed.
[3:55:54.640 --> 3:55:59.360]  They would have credit that most likely to, oh, you have a million people in one location,
[3:55:59.360 --> 3:56:00.360]  signals are shit.
[3:56:00.360 --> 3:56:05.240]  Well, I know plenty of people that were communicating, but we weren't able to, you know, and most
[3:56:05.240 --> 3:56:06.720]  people there weren't able to.
[3:56:06.720 --> 3:56:12.000]  So there's a lot of things that factor into it, but I do think and feel it's standard
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:18.040]  protocol to, you know, jam signals for force protection measures, which I agree with when
[3:56:18.040 --> 3:56:19.040]  it comes to.
[3:56:19.040 --> 3:56:20.040]  Joey, we're out of time.
[3:56:20.040 --> 3:56:21.040]  You got to come back on.
[3:56:21.040 --> 3:56:22.040]  Don't worry about this on the anniversary tomorrow.
[3:56:22.040 --> 3:56:25.400]  You got a bunch of big guests tomorrow, but here's what's going on.
[3:56:25.400 --> 3:56:27.800]  We know they knew there was a giant federal force there.
[3:56:27.800 --> 3:56:31.680]  They didn't stop the few dozen people that breached the first cops.
[3:56:31.680 --> 3:56:33.480]  And so they were there to supposedly stop this.
[3:56:33.480 --> 3:56:34.560]  They stood down.
[3:56:34.560 --> 3:56:39.200]  There was a federal surveillance with thousands of personnel that stood down.
[3:56:39.200 --> 3:56:42.160]  And that is a congressional investigation that needs to happen.
[3:56:42.160 --> 3:56:44.680]  And Trump needs to get on that right now.
[3:56:44.680 --> 3:56:45.680]  Yeah.
[3:56:45.680 --> 3:56:47.240]  I mean, absolutely.
[3:56:47.240 --> 3:56:48.480]  There was it.
[3:56:48.480 --> 3:56:54.600]  When we watched the assets that were staged unfold in front of our eyes, I literally remember
[3:56:54.600 --> 3:56:57.520]  asking myself, why now?
[3:56:57.520 --> 3:57:00.000]  Why wasn't this deployed last night?
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  To prevent.
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:03.680]  Well, you sit on the rooftop like, look this, they're all preplanned.
[3:57:03.680 --> 3:57:08.800]  They just boiled out at that should be the save years after the provocateur event.
[3:57:08.800 --> 3:57:09.800]  All right, Joey.
[3:57:09.800 --> 3:57:10.800]  Thank you so much.
[3:57:10.800 --> 3:57:11.800]  Powerful interview.
[3:57:11.800 --> 3:57:13.880]  Appreciate you coming on to talk about all that.
[3:57:13.880 --> 3:57:14.880]  And we are 300.
[3:57:14.880 --> 3:57:15.880]  Thank you, sir.
[3:57:15.880 --> 3:57:18.000]  We're 307 days out from the election.
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:20.360]  Their whole narrative is we're terrorists.
[3:57:20.360 --> 3:57:23.080]  Anybody that loves America is bad and they're going to stage stuff and blame us.
[3:57:23.080 --> 3:57:24.240]  This is not rocket science.
[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:25.240]  Okay.
[3:57:25.240 --> 3:57:26.240]  All the pre-programming is there.
[3:57:26.240 --> 3:57:27.760]  How do we stop them?
[3:57:27.760 --> 3:57:30.520]  We better be asking ourselves that question all day long.
[3:57:30.520 --> 3:57:33.080]  And by the way, they're going to start a civil war.
[3:57:33.080 --> 3:57:34.080]  They lose.
[3:57:34.080 --> 3:57:35.080]  That's the globalist plan.
[3:57:35.080 --> 3:57:36.080]  Bring the country down.
[3:57:36.080 --> 3:57:37.800]  We do not want violence.
[3:57:37.800 --> 3:57:40.600]  We do not want civil war.
[3:57:40.600 --> 3:57:46.360]  Intellectual victories what we want.
