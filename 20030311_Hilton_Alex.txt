[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]  We've got to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat here.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  Now, I'm honored to have him on the show with his busy schedule.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  He's been in court all last week and all this week, and we had him on about a year ago.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  He's Stanley Hilton.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  He was brutally attacked by the mid-government pimp, Sanity and Combs.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  He was a senior advisor to Bob Dole, counsel for Bob Dole and others in the Republican Party.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]  He's an expert on government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  He's written a book about it throughout history.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  And he now has new revelations, never before revealed, from his depositions of witnesses involved in and around 9-1-1.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]  He represents over 400 of the victims of 9-1-1's families.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  And he's been given almost no attention, while some of the other groups, headed by well-known PR bureaucrats, and we've had them on the show as well, are trying to suppress this information.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  Joining us is Stanley Hilton. We're honored to have you on the show, Stanley.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  Glad to be here.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  Tell us just a little bit about yourself, your lawsuit, recap what we covered last year and the last year.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  Tell us what's developed with the lawsuit and the new revelations that you told me about on the phone.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  Well, we filed the lawsuit last May against Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld and several others, Rice and the rest of the terrorists that run the U.S. government,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  for complicity in causing and also aiding and abetting the 9-1-1 attacks in order to promote their political agenda.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  And we're in the process, you know, these lawsuits, they come in ebbs and tides.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  They come and they go in terms of level activity.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  And most of it is done, you know, in confidential, what's called discovery litigation, that is depositions under oath, battles in court to get documents.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  We're facing very strong resistance from the government.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  They're claiming national security over everything, claiming they don't want to release documents, etc.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  But I'm representing people that are victimized by what the government did.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  We're also challenging the constitutionality of the so-called U.S. Patriot Act, as they call it, the anti-Patriot Act, as I call it, Patriot Act 1 and 2,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  with number 2 in the wings that the government plans to introduce this year, which will be even more severe than Patriot Act 1.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  And in this new one, Patriot Act 2, they're going to give Bush the right to declare any American citizen a, quote, enemy combatant, end quote, arbitrarily.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  And then take away your citizenship.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  This will give the government the power to literally strip any American of citizenship if Bush says you're an enemy combatant, i.e. political opponent of the government.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  So anyway, all this is being brought up.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  We found some very interesting documents and memoranda, including several of those advisers around Bush, namely Wolfowitz, Wormser, Feith, and Pearl, the rest of them.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  And they actually wrote these memos several months before 9-11 in which they fervently wished for a, quote, Pearl Harbor-type incident, end quote,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  to give them the shock value that would enable them to ram through their agenda.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  Now, you told me last week, before this was on ABC News, that you had gotten some of this information through depositions and some other little tidbits that haven't been disclosed.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000]  But also, you talked about how you've deposed, you've got the marriage certificates, the evidence, the photographs, a woman who was married to one of the hijackers.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]  You talked to, what, you said six or eight people that were connected to them.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  And then we have the news articles where the FBI gave them homes, paid their rent, followed them around.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  We know Israel was involved doing similar things.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  Can you speak to that, please?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  Yes, I do have a witness who was married.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  It's an American woman, but she was married to one of the hijackers, and she knew about seven of them.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  She met seven of them.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  Essentially, these Arab hijackers were double agents.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  That is, they were operating inside the U.S. for 10 to 15 years in, quote, cells, end quote.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  Some of them use the term al-Qaeda.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  They've used other terms.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]  You know, that's just a word.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]  Al-Qaeda is just a word.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  I mean, I could, you know, that means nothing.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  You could call them the Muslim Brotherhood, the Army of God.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  They go by all sorts of names.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]  But what they are is a series of cells that have been aided and abetted by the U.S. government.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  This woman was involved also, married to them at the time of the 1993 World Trade Center first bombing
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  and of the Oklahoma City bombing when, in which her, quote, ex-husband actually traveled to Oklahoma City
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]  several weeks before the bombings, and they were involved apparently in that.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  But what we have here is double agents in that they nominally appear to be Arab fanatics.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  But one of the points that she stressed is they're really not, you know, Muslim.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  I mean, they're more interested in Playboy than in the Koran.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  I mean, these people drink.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]  They're very secular.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.000]  They're not the fanatical Muslim zealots that the Bush criminals would let us believe is what's operating here.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  What they are is they receive regular payments from the U.S. government.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]  They've been recruited by CIA, FBI, counterintelligence and so forth and paid money
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  and allowed to exchange information with U.S. government agents about various activities going on.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  Now, let me stop you right there, Mr. Hilton.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  Everything you said was already backed up by mainstream reports.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  You've gotten it now in sworn testimony and depositions under oath.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  But something everybody wants to ignore is that three of the hijackers at least were trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]  not at a local airfield on the base by the government, at least.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]  Now we find out eight of the hijackers under names we heard are still alive in the Middle East on television doing interviews.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  You know, their faces, their names, same people.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]  We have then Muhammad Atta being sent over to the Defense Language School Monterey.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]  You talked to Steven Butler, the colonel there, the dean of the school.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]  So we know this.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]  And then I have the stories on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the 911 Archives,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]  which is a great research tool for anybody, where they admit, you know, FBI paid for their houses.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  FBI lived with them.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  Mossad lived with them.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  Now you're saying double agents.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]  And you're saying what we already had the pieces of here without your depositions,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]  but it's a great confirmation that they're involved in World Trade Center 1 and 93.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  They're involved in Oklahoma City.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  But here's the deal.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  The FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, gave the guys the detonators in the first World Trade Center.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  We know that.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]  That's New York Times.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  We know that the feds were inside planting the bombs in Oklahoma City and had these Iraqis outside with McVeigh.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  I've talked to the police, the FBI.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  So when you say double agent, I would venture to say that these are double agents who are still alive,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  who were just seen at the scene of the crime while the globalists militarily carry out the attacks themselves.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  That's where the evidence points.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  But what you've proven and what the news has proven is that they at least receive payments and training and protection.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  And FBI has been told not to stop these Al Qaeda groups.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  Go ahead.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  The witness I was talking about personally met two Adas, Mohammed and then he had a younger brother.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  They're alleged to be two of the ones on the airliners.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  The thing is these individuals are, in my view, quote, tatsies.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  That is, they were paid by the government.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  I don't believe that they themselves flew the planes into it.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000]  As I said previously, one of our allegations is that the government has this device that we code name Cyclops
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  that allows from an air base nearby to disable the pilot's control of airliners and to drive them by remote control.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]  That's admitted decades old.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]  It's called Global Hawk.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  Yeah, Global Hawk, right.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  Of course, the government denies it's been, quote, deployed.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  They say they've got the technology, but they haven't deployed it.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  Let me stop you.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  Let me stop you.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  This is really key, sir, and we're so honored to have you.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  I've really studied this and I want to give you, and you probably already have, but I want to reiterate it for listeners.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  Bush, two days after the attack, at a speech in New York, said in the future we can remote control these planes and land them so this doesn't happen.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]  And someone reached up and physically grabbed him by the arm and made him shut up.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  And if you've seen the Masters of Terror, I know you've got a copy, we have the two Associated Press articles.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  After you were on our show and brought this up that you have this from inside military officers,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  suddenly they had a cover story in two AP articles in New York Daily News, all in the film, where they said, oh, lo and behold, 830 in the morning,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  the CIA was running a drill of flying jetliners into buildings in New York and D.C.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000]  Just so happened that that very minute they were running this, it just so happened NORAD stood down for an hour and a half to 58 minutes in different cases.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  I mean, it's incredible when you add all this together.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  Go ahead.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  The official government party line is, their first line of defense is that the technology is science fiction.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  It doesn't exist.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]  But that's a total lie.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  Anybody that works, and I've spoken to hundreds of mechanics and maintenance managers at United Airlines, American Airlines, several others,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  they all confirm the technology exists.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  Well, how do drones operate, the companies in Fort Worth?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]  Sure, sure.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  The question is, has it been deployed?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  The answer is yes, it has.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  I witnessed it was on the very same United aircraft from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco, four days before September 11th,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  and observed certain individuals on that plane who were then later claimed to be the hijackers.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  He observed them speaking with a government agent.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  Is that Mr. Woods?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  I can't disclose names on that right now.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  And then he was threatened, because I don't know if it is Woods, but Woods said he was...
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  No, no, it's not Woods.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  It's someone else.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  Someone else.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]  But with Woods, the famous actor, he got off and said, this is a problem, and FBI came and said,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  you tell anybody about this, you're going to jail.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  Well, yes, that's right.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  The Anti-Patriot Acts 1 and 2, as they call them, are the tools which are very similar to what happened in Nazi Germany.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  Hitler's Enabling Act, after the Reichstag fire, gave him dictatorial power.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  That's the goal here.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]  That's the end run.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  This is what we have to look at, what their purpose ultimately is.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  I mean, this attempt to invade Iraq now for no purpose is coming in, I guess, next week or the week after.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  It's just starting.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]  This was planned long before 9-11, these people around Wolfowitz and so forth.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  I mean, I went to school with Wolfowitz.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  I was in the same university in the late 60s.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  He was very active with the Israelis over there at the University of Chicago and so forth.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]  He was pursuing a PhD.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  And these people have an agenda.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  It's not an agenda that helps the American people.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  It's an attempt to use this country and its power to wreck this country in service of another nefarious and ulterior goal.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  Now, Mr. Hilton, there's a lot to cover.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  Can we just go through your depositions?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  And this is incredibly dangerous.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]  You have incredible, amazing honor and will.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]  And I mean this, sir.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  God bless you.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  People like you are going to save this country.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  Your witnesses do.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  You know what you're doing is very, very dangerous.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  I hope you have large life insurance policies.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  I need them too.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]  Well, no, what you're really doing pierces the veil and you're on target.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  But there's so many of us now, it's why they're on the run and we're on the march.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  Go down some of the key stuff you've got in depositions.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  I don't want to give your whole case away because they list them.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  Right.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  Well, as I mentioned, the individual on the aircraft that was later hijacked, four days later, same flight, same destination,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  Newark to San Francisco, what he observed and what others on that plane, including United flight attendants,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  observed, these individuals four days later were said to be on the planes that crashed it and their government controlled.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  And this term is tradecraft, meaning basically spying, counter spying.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  And one of the terms in tradecraft is control, the agent that controls.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000]  These Arabs that were alleged to have done it had controls and some of our discoveries have identified some of these people.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]  They are FBI and CIA agents.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  So they had control actual agents or case officers and then they had their little minion drones with them.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  Yeah, these people operate in cells.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  The cells are from six to 12 individuals and the cells move around.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  For instance, from Portland, Oregon to San Diego is just one example.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]  They didn't move all six or 12 of them by chance.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  They were instructed to do it.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  Their locations, their schools, their apartments, et cetera, that were bought here.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  Again, this is from a direct eyewitness on this and this has been verified with marriage certificate documents, photographs,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  photographs with Bin Laden and his brothers, et cetera.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]  Paid for by the U.S. government.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]  That's official.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  Yeah.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  Associated Press, Washington Post and they just kind of brushed that over.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  See, the thing is that you look back in 93 and 95 Oklahoma City World Trade Center.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  You say, well, Clinton was in power whereas now it's Bush.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]  So you say, well, how could it be the same players here?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000]  Answer is that the shadow government transcends individual political puppets that occupy 1600 Pennsylvania.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]  I mean, you know, it doesn't really make much difference whether it's Clinton or Bush.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]  There are other, the shadow government as I call it essentially is, you know, continuous.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  And these bureaucrats that you've got there in the Pentagon, State Department, White House, et cetera, you know, they last.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]  They stay on.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]  They stay on from administration to administration pursuing a certain agenda.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  And I think this is all part of a pattern.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  And the latest example manifestation was 9-11.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]  But, you know, you've got that.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  You've got the anthrax attacks which happened conveniently right after 9-11.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:37.000]  That turns out, most weaponized form of anthrax ever seen, U.S. government patented design at these micron, incredibly small levels, coded in bentonite, sent.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  And then Bush is on Cipril, the anthrax antibiotic, on September 10th with his cabinet.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  Judicial Watch tries to serve a summons to depose the press secretary who admitted this.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  And they tell him at the front gate, you'll be arrested if you depose us.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  Yeah.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]  Did you hear about that?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]  Yes, I did.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  Stay there.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  I mean, Clinton didn't even do that.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  Stanley Hilton, an amazing man.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  All right.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  And we'll take your calls for Mr. Hilton in the next hour.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  Again, this guy knows what he's talking about.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  He's worked in some of the highest levels of the U.S. government in the U.S. Senate.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  His counsel is Bob Dole.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  He's a good American.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  He knows tyranny when he sees it.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]  Same thing with me, you know.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]  Again, I've been a Republican for years, but I'm not this type of Republican.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  I love America, the Bill of Rights.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  These neocons are the worst of Stalin and Hitler rolled into one.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  And I'm not using those terms for effect.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  These are scary people.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  Mr. Hilton, from your experience, what type of groups, people, the shadow government,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]  which they just announced, remember, last year, that we've known about for years,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  and what does the shadow government want this world to be like?
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:11.000]  Basically a one-world globalist tyranny controlled by them, of course, the neocons, neoconservants, so-called.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]  But they're not really conservatives.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  They're radicals because they're seeking the radical destruction of our way of life
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]  for the last 200 years.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]  They're basically introducing an alien, anti-American form of tyranny,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000]  which has more to do with old Europe and Asia than it has to do with this country.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  The ultimate goal, of course, is to advance their own agenda.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]  Certainly expansion of Israel's borders from the Nile to the Euphrates, as they say the Bible mandates,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]  is certainly a major goal, no question about it.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  The emulation of Sharon's government in Israel turned the U.S. into sort of a super-Israel, I think, is another purpose.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  And if you look at what's going on now with the propaganda war,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  all this 9-11 and exaggerations and lies and so forth by these criminals around Bush,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]  that is certainly aimed at the agenda.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]  A territorial expansion of Israel in the Middle East is a major goal, there's no question about it.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]  The key motive I haven't talked enough about, but we do have the trillions of dollars of oil,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  the weapons sales, the 1.7 to 1.9 trillion cost of a five-year occupation paid into the Carlyle Group and others,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  the domestic police state crackdown, the smokescreen for economic collapse while they consolidate,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  while they suck Enron and other companies' pride,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]  and they can declare national security on investigations of that.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  I would agree with you about Israel because, and what makes me lean more towards what you're saying,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  is that one of the central crown jewels or the star of the crown there, one of the big ones, the headpiece,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  is that the announcement three months ago by Reuters, by Israel,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  the government's going to let us kill American citizens in America.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]  No judge, no jury, no nothing, they're just going to kill us.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  And now James Weapons, this is mainstream, the big world weapons tracker, came out about Israel and other,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  some of the Times of London, with race-specific viruses and bacteria to kill other races other than themselves.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  That is the ultimate of Hitlerian-type activities.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  Well, you know, the term that's been used has been zionazis.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  I think it's an apt term, zionazis.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]  And I think it's ironic because, you know, the Nazis based their theory on the, quote,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]  protocols of the elders of Zion, which are alleged to be a shake by the czar claiming that Jews wanted world conquest.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000]  Now we've got the complete reverse where the current zionazis in Israel and their friends here in the Bush administration
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]  and elsewhere are emulating the antler.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]  That's right, it comes full circle.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  Essentially it's the same thing, whether you call them Jews or non-Jews.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  The point is it's the same ideology.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  Yeah, it could be Chinese, you know, you said the Asian model.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  Sure.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]  I mean, it's just old-fashioned, you know, Egyptian, Babylonian, ancient tyranny.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  Yeah, the word, Hitler used the word Jew.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  Today the word we're using is terrorist.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]  This term terrorist can apply to anybody, as I said.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  They're attempting to legalize it just as Hitler had the 1935 Nuremberg Laws outlawing Jews.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]  Well, now they're trying to come up with anti-patriot laws too,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  to outlaw any kind of dissent and call you a terrorist.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]  If you attack Bush or these criminals around him, these alien criminals.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  And I think the agenda is clear.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  It's to turn American people into Palestinian slaves.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]  I mean, that's what it seems to me, just as the Israelis are treating the Palestinians there as subhumans.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  And then to legitimize that, they founded Hamas, which is now admitted.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  Is the lack of privacy bugging you?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]  Peace of mind is now within your reach.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  The bug detector offers state-of-the-art protection.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  Whether it's Adolf Hitler or Saddam Hussein, the globalists, the New World Order,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.000]  has funded and trained them to bring you the crises so they can offer their solution to world government.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]  We're talking to Stanley Hilton.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]  He is the lawyer for over 400 of the victims' families in 9-1-1.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]  He's suing the government not just for prior knowledge, but for complicity.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]  He now, to recap, has the evidence from depositions, government agents, you name it,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]  wives of supposed hijackers, that they were paid, funded, housed, protected by the U.S. government.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]  That's all come out in mainstream news, but a piece here, a piece there.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]  Oh, the FBI had a strange twist.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]  Owned the houses where the hijackers lived and paid them.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  And another twist, they were trained in a secret military program at Pensacola.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]  On and on and on.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]  L.A. Times before the attacks.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]  Bush sends $134 million to the Taliban.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]  They're in business together.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]  The Bin Ladins are in satellites and oil, and they just bought, through the Car Law Group,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]  Universal Studios, and they're buying up radio networks and TV.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]  And you've got all this happening, and you add it all together.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]  Mr. Hilton, have you heard him talk about how torture is good?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]  And as if that's not enough of terrorist suspects, now they want to torture terrorist suspects' children.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  But the Patriot Act in Section 802 says that any action that endangers human life
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]  that's a violation of any federal or state law, as a lawyer, as Bobville's former chief counsel,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]  what does that mean when the definition is any action that endangers human life
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]  that's a violation of federal or state law?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]  This isn't just going to be the Arabs that get tortured, is it?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  No, it's just a blank check for the government to completely destroy democracy and torture any dissenter.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  Alan Dershowitz, the so-called professor of law at Harvard, which is my alma mater,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  Harvard University Law School, he's the one that's coming out with, of course, this calling for torture.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]  I believe he testified before a Senate committee a few weeks ago.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]  Stick needles under their fingers.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000]  Well, you know, him and his book of chutzpah and elsewhere, there's another Israeli first or dual loyalist.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]  But, you know, I should say, I don't know if I'd even use the term dual loyalist.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]  I'd rather think Israeli loyalist. I mean, these are the people behind it.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000]  Well, it is bizarre. It was Abrams on the Abrams Report on MSNBC said, let's torture people's children.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000]  I'm sorry, torturing children is wrong, and we are seeing this unified Nazi-like weird race thing.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  Well, you know, I hope this will backfire on them because this is outrageous.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000]  It's an attempt to, you know, there's a word in Hebrew called goyim, G-O-Y-I-M,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]  which means non-Jews and it means cattle is what it means.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]  And so I think that summarizes it all.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]  You know, you torture the cattle. What difference does it make? They're not the master race.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]  You know, you cannot have first class citizenship in Israel unless you're born from a Jewish mother.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]  Now, if that's not racism, you tell me what it is. These are the people we're dying for.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]  I mean, that's the law of Israel. It's, you know, you can be born in Milwaukee
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]  and as long as your mother's Jewish, you can become an Israeli citizen.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]  But if you're born in Jerusalem and you don't have a Jewish mother, you can't.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  Now, you tell me if that's not racist.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000]  Israel's got a big problem because the left wing has woken up to the incredible racism we're dealing with here.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  And whether it's Hitler or Jiang Zemin or Israel involved in all this, it's wrong.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]  Now, and when they're saying they're going to come in here and kill American citizens with no trial,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]  I mean, if it was Russians doing that, would we put up with it?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]  Well, you know, Russia is against our friend now. You know, Bush is cozy up to Putin now.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000]  I guess, you know, he's saying Chechnya, the genocide in Chechnya is okay because there are terrorists there.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]  I mean, you know, why are these people suddenly our friends?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]  I thought the whole Cold War for 50 years was there.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]  And by the way, Putin got his war. He was caught blowing up apartment buildings.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]  That's mainstream news. Blaming it on the Chechnyans.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.000]  Theaters. Yeah, Putin is just another version of the Russian czars and the commissars and so on.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000]  And now these people are being presented as friends and as Bush is saying he's looking into this fellow's eyes
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]  and seeing a great man. I mean, Putin is an ex-KGB person. What do you expect from him?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  Absolutely.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]  These are the people that are being presented as models for this government.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]  These are the individuals calling for torture and stuff that are supposed to be leading this country.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]  Totally sick. We'll come back and take calls and recap some of the top news.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:06.000]  He's the T. Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000]  We're talking to Stanley Hilton, chief counsel to Bob Dole,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000]  one of the architects of the Strategic Petroleum Initiative to get that set up.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:26.000]  And he, of course, is a Harvard graduate. He represents 400 of the victims' families, according to press reports.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]  Over 400 of the victims' families in 9-1-1. And he isn't charging prior knowledge.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000]  He has the evidence. He's done the depositions on the facts, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]  confirmed by news articles that already came out. He just went and documented it for himself
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]  that the FBI and CIA handles and controls radical Islam.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000]  Yusak Rabin, right before he was assassinated by Mossad, who's a good man for telling the truth, said,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]  I apologize, he said at Tel Aviv University, the Jerusalem Post reported,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:04.000]  for the fact that Israel founded Hamas to destabilize the region so there can never be a true peace.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000]  So whether it's Bush or the Communist Chinese or the radical Israelis, these globalists need crises.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]  They want war. They want slavery. They want this to happen.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:24.000]  And it's happening, whether you're a Saxe-Coburg, Goethe-German like Bush, or Ariel Sharon.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]  They're all together in this new world order.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  And look, when they start talking about torturing terror suspect children and assassinating Americans,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000]  that's when I come out and say no. Now, I know we've got Andy and Jackie and Gordon and Dan and Kevin,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]  they've all been holding one to talk to you.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]  Any other key depositions you've done, not just with military officers or witnesses of the feds
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000]  protecting the hijackers on planes and training them, or people inside the airlines with the Global Hawk
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]  on these aircraft, all of this, break it down. Any other key smoking gun pieces of evidence?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]  And where's your lawsuit going? I've read in the press the government's declaring national security on that
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]  and on the firefighter tapes that were reporting bombs going off.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]  They first said all the tapes malfunctioned. Turns out they're all there grabbed by Bush.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]  Can you break all this down for us? Any other key areas?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]  Yeah, well, there's a lot of this that I can't really talk about on the air for obvious reasons.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000]  But I think the evidence is building, and we're going to eventually get it out to light a day in a public trial,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  which we hope to bring next year here in the federal court.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.000]  And also, it's part of a larger agenda, but what's really going on is we hope to examine the constitutionality
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]  of this anti-patriot act because it's clearly unconstitutional.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000]  The Eighth Amendment says you can't use cruel and unusual punishment.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  Dershowitz and pals and his friends around Bush, of course, don't think that means a damn thing.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]  And they want to bring about a lawless society under the guise of laws. Lawless.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000]  And it's really largely political, but I think the evidence, the evidence will show that these criminals
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  have not only got to be removed from power but brought to justice for their crimes,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]  including mass murder and attempt to destroy this country's democracy.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:19.000]  Well, I would say our constitutional republic, and Mr. Hilton, I would add to that that across the board here,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]  you read Patriot Act II, and I've written an analysis of it on Infowars.com.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]  I mean, it says they can grab you for any reason, not even knowing that you aided a terrorist,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]  grab you, not even telling when they grabbed you, you're a missing person,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]  and then it's got a subsection on secret executions.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000]  Yeah, this sounds like some kind of fiction, bad fiction novel, but, you know, throughout history,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000]  totalitarian regimes have used terror as an instrument of state policy, and that's what we have today.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]  It's just a continuation of history. I mean, the czars in Russia used it, the Nazis used it,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]  the communists used it. It's nothing new. This is just a new guise, and they're bringing about selective terror.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]  I would suspect that they'll try something again, maybe not quite as spectacular as 9-11,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]  but certainly something of that nature to try and again galvanize what's called the GSR,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000]  galvanic skin response, to get the people scared to death, and so they'll give up more and more of their rights.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]  But it's all an illusion. What we need to do is get rid of these criminals, bring them to justice,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]  have them arrested under a real tribunal, and put them on trial for their crimes against not only the American people,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]  but their crimes against humanity.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]  Well, it's amazing. You know, the world is getting wise to this.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]  The majority of people in Europe, and I've read the polls, are saying the globalists carry 9-11 out.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]  Oh, yeah.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000]  And so where is your suit going? I mean, how are they trying to block it using national security?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:54.000]  By refusing to give us documents that we have subpoenaed, documents that we've demanded by the regular court processes,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:02.000]  by claiming that there is national security overrides and a need for information in a suit.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]  They've also attempted to bribe several of the plaintiffs.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]  One of the fellows I used to work with in the U.S. Senate, named Ken Feinberg,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:17.000]  is in charge of handing out what I call sugar-coated bribes that is monetary awards to any of the victims of 9-11,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]  their families, who will drop their suits or waive their right to sue.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]  In fact, some of them have brought suit against him.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]  I know that guy personally because I used to work with him in the Senate Judiciary Committee,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]  and that's one of the things they're trying to do.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000]  But as far as my suit is concerned, they're trying to raise this blanket of national security,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000]  and so a lot of it is involved now in the litigation process and so forth.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]  I mean, they can claim that to hide everything, to hide what they're doing.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]  That's just a word. That means nothing, national security. What does that mean?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]  Especially when we're accusing these very individuals of sabotaging national security of this country
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]  to pursue their own political agenda.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:04.000]  Well, the new Patriot Act gets rid of almost all civil rights suits and court orders and gives them total immunity,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]  just like Bush's Homeland Security gave vaccine-makers immunity for autism class-action suits.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]  I mean, you're right. It's criminals giving themselves immunity.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]  That's right. That's right. Well, of course, you know, in Nazi Germany, you can't sue Hitler.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]  Did anybody try to sue Hitler? No, he got immunity too.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]  And the same is true as communists or czars, Russia, Mao Zedong in China, what have you.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:34.000]  You know, you cannot enforce your rights unless you can bring these criminals to justice in a court of law,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]  and they're trying to take away that right.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000]  Not only that way, but in many other ways, trying to attack so-called, quote, trial lawyers, end quote,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000]  totally take away people's rights, condom them into believing that you should just blindly follow Bush,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]  make Bush a god, you know, and it's really very frightening.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]  What did you think, because I had Judicial Watch on.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:07.000]  Judicial Watch is suing Bush for the workers there at the post office who wouldn't get treatment even after the anthrax attacks were going.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]  Turns out Bush and his cabinet were on ship row.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000]  Judicial Watch twice tried to serve papers to the White House press secretary who admitted in a press conference
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.000]  October 10th of 2001 that they were all on ship row, and they tried to deliver the subpoena, you know, for the deposition,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000]  and they said, we'll arrest you, this is in the news, under the Patriot Act if you drop that subpoena.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]  Now, Clinton would accept subpoenas.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]  Now they're threatening to arrest people for terrorism and they give somebody a subpoena?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000]  Yeah. Well, it's absurd, but it's like the situation at the Albany, New York mall where they arrested a guy for wearing a peace t-shirt.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]  I mean, we're clearly losing civil liberties here.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]  It's just really awful.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]  And the way you do that, you undermine like a termite, you know, you undermine and destroy the foundation of people's freedom.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:02.000]  And you have people themselves going, I have a client here in San Francisco who was fired by Neiman Marcus a couple weeks ago
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000]  because he was distributing some of your literature, Alex, like your videotapes and some of those deception dollars.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000]  They have Bush's face as a, you know, as basically a war criminal and as a big brother.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000]  And these people arrested him, they put him in handcuffs, they beat him up, they escorted him out of there and they fired him.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]  And they said, the country's in war.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000]  And by the way, he's a listener of this show, Abel Ashe, during, when the security guy walked him in,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000]  he was doing this during his lunch break, which everybody was doing, and everybody was giving stuff out during lunch break.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]  And he said to him, you're not allowed to do this.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]  You're not allowed to speak out.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]  We're at war.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]  You can't do that.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]  And then fired him.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000]  So that is, it shows the mindset, the insane mindset.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]  Yeah.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]  Well, it's like, very much like the analogy with termites.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000]  I mean, the criminals, what they're doing is they're sending out the termites to undermine the foundation of the country.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000]  And just as with termites, you can think there's a brilliant house there and it's ready to collapse because of the rot inside.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]  That's what's happening here.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]  This country is rotting away.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:15.000]  And these termites are conning average citizens, security guards, mall guards, to go out against people.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]  And they're saying, you know, put an American flag bumper sticker on.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]  That makes you a patriot.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]  Meanwhile, you're destroying the very principles the flag is supposed to.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]  There you go.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]  We have listeners that are really patient.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]  Can we take some calls?
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]  Sure.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]  Andy in Ohio and then Jackie, Gordon, Dan and Kevin.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]  Go ahead, Andy.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]  Alex, good to talk to you.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]  You bet.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]  You're on the air with our guests.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]  I'm really pleased to talk to you, Mr. Hilton.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]  Thank you.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000]  And I wanted to ask you, do you think that on September 11th, were there hijackers on those planes or not?
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000]  You know, it's hard to say since we've never seen, from a legal point of view, the bodies.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]  There's never been autopsies and so forth.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]  We've never identified bodies.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]  But there was a passport found in the rubble, uncharged.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]  It turns out eight of the 19 are still alive.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]  Yeah.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]  It's clear they're passives, as he said, just seen on camera.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]  We know that.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]  What he's focusing on is who paid their rent?
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]  The FBI.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]  Yeah.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]  Who protected them?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]  Who told FBI agents not to stop them?
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]  The FBI, CIA, W1999, Bush.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]  Is that what you're saying, Mr. Hilton?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]  You can prove they work for the U.S. government.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]  Oh, yes, but they were on the government's payroll.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]  There's no question.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]  As I said earlier, double agents, in some cases, triple agents.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000]  But, you know, the point is that what we have here is a situation where, in my opinion,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]  some of those alleged 19 were on the plane, some were not.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]  The person that used to be married to my witness, for example, we have some evidence to believe
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]  that he's still alive, that he's contacted her.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]  And so how could he be dead in a crash when he's contacting her now?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff we're dealing with now.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]  These are individuals that were groomed by the U.S. government, and they were protected.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]  And you said you have depositions, and this is what I already had, too, that they were involved
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]  in Oklahoma City and World Trade Center One.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000]  Yeah, that they took trips out there shortly before the April 1995 bombings, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000]  and that, you know, even the date there, Hitler's birthday being April 20th, you know,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]  that was all, of course, hinting at anti-Semitism because Hitler is the anti-Semi, so the air goes...
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000]  So trying to blame it on the right wing using Islamic proxies, now we see the story being circulated
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]  that the real right wing that fights the New World Order is connected to Saddam.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]  And why would Clinton, after these guys were arrested by good FBI, order their release?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]  And why wouldn't the Feds release the surveillance camera footage of them bombing the building?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]  Correct, Stanley?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]  Yes, yes.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]  So showing government operatives being protected to later be linked up with the American people,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]  the sick homeland security on, let's face it, white people.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]  Get you trained to accept it to get the error of abstinence for everybody.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]  All right, Stanley Hill is going to stay with us for another 20 minutes.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]  We'll have time to get to all your calls.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000]  Jackie in Oklahoma, you're on the air with the attorney suing George Bush for complicit action in 9-1-1,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]  which is totally documented.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]  A 10-year-old can figure that out if we can just get the people to face the facts.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]  Jackie, go ahead.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]  Hi, Alex.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]  We love you.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]  I called in before I even realized that you had a guest speaker.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]  I know you've been holding.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]  Do you have any comments or questions for our guest?
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]  Well, God bless you, Mr. Hilton, for your efforts.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000]  My concern is that with the powers that be having as much power and control as they do,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.000]  if we're going to be able to actually get in a control crisis that is predicted that may happen.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000]  And my question for you, Alex, is that there's a deterrent of what's going on really,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]  and that could be this planet headed this way.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]  Well, let me try to bull down what you're saying.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]  The globalists, as Stanley said earlier, are going to blow more stuff up,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]  legitimize their war.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]  We criticize it, point out how it's wrong.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]  They go, we've got to do this to protect you.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]  My job is to protect the American people.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]  Bush said it over and over again.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]  They blow more stuff up.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]  He poses as our savior.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000]  A national talk show host out there, Michael Savage, has said anyone that criticizes the government
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]  should be put in a forced labor camp.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]  He's now on national TV, MSNBC.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]  They're on the Nazi channel, same place where Abrams says torture kids.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]  He's on there saying put us in forced labor camps.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]  So they're shutting up this paradigm.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]  That's why it's so important to expose them, the globalists, for being involved in 9-1-1,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]  and that neutralizes them.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]  Mr. Hilton, any comments?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]  Well, yeah.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000]  I mean, I think that there's no question that what she mentions, you know, is how about,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]  they have so much power in all this.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]  All these tyrannical governments put on the shield of power.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]  They always fall because of their own nature.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]  Yeah.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]  You know, look at Russia.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]  They had communist tyranny, but it fell eventually.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]  I mean, you know, because people were sick of it.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000]  If it's rotten from the inside, like a termite analogy again, the structure will collapse.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]  It could be a mansion.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]  It could be a fortress.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000]  But if you chip away at it enough and the underlying population realizes what this fraudulent
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]  deception is, eventually it'll collapse from within.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]  It'll implode, as Lincoln would say.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]  It's an implosion.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]  But could all this be a deterrent, the possibility?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]  I know Alex doesn't want to talk about it.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]  This planet headed this way.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]  Oh, that's total diversion, total government hype.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]  How do you hear the word?
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]  Of the what?
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]  Just don't worry about it.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]  I appreciate the call, Jackie.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]  My goodness.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]  It's just the government controls the fake conspiracy shows, and they talk about kooky stuff,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]  and then everybody picks it up and goes with all that and then nothing, and then it diverts everybody.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]  Let me tell you what the big thing the globalists are worried about.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]  The people getting advanced technology, the people getting life extension,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]  sovereign nations having their own sovereignty, and the global empire losing control.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]  That's why they're racing to do this.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]  Let's go to Gordon.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]  Gordon, where are you calling from tonight?
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]  I'm coming from Toronto.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]  Welcome from Canada.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]  Go ahead.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]  Hi.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]  I really appreciate your show.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]  Hi, Mr. Hilton.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]  Hello.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]  First time I heard about you was at the Washington protest in October.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000]  I went there to attend, and I was given a pamphlet where I discovered that you were representing family members.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]  So I really appreciate your work and your family.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]  Almost total news blackout, and he represents more families than anybody else.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]  Right.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]  Actually, Alex, for you, I have something interesting.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000]  A couple of weeks ago, I don't know the man, but I came across him.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]  His name is Rocco Galati.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:55.000]  He was the lawyer for Del Mart Vreeland, and it was in a conference at the University of Toronto.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]  He mentioned his name, so I waited after the conference to speak to him.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]  I approached him as he indeed was Rocco Galati.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]  He said yes, and I asked him what had happened to Del Mart Vreeland.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000]  He drew closer and whispered that he's dead.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:23.000]  I speculated that he was killed in August, and he said that he had been killed September the 4th of 2002.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]  Now what, you're saying his lawyer said this?
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]  Yes. Yes, indeed.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]  Did Mike Rupert write about this?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]  Not yet. Not that I've seen.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]  I don't know if that's a true story.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]  Were you familiar with the Vreeland story, Mr. Hilton?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]  No.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]  Well, he was this guy who did pass to jail guard, said he was Naval Intelligence.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]  He was in jail, fleeing the U.S. government up in Canada.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]  Oh, wait a minute. I think I know now. I do know who it is. Yes, I do.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]  And he gave him the letter saying the World Trade Center is going to get knocked down. That was confirmed.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]  Yes.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000]  And then this caller from Toronto saying he's dead. I don't know if that's the case. I'll have to find out.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]  I know who it is, but I don't know whether he's alive or not. I don't know.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]  Well, I mean, I think Galati's a good man. I don't think he's lying.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]  He may, that's what he may believe right now.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]  Why would he whisper that? We'll try to find out what happened. I'll make some calls, okay?
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]  I don't like to speculate. I like to stick to what we can prove.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.000]  Absolutely. I just want to mention that the next day was when he was due for court for his trial.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]  This is a fellow with the ONI Office of Naval Intelligence?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]  Yes.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]  Yeah, ONI, right.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]  And the next day he was due in court.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]  All right. Thanks for the call. We don't know if that's true. I'll have to check this stuff out.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000]  There's so much, there's an endless sea of real news. Why speculate?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]  We'll be right back with more calls for our guests.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]  This is GPS.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]  What can you do without freedom?
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]  Will you fight?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]  Against that?
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]  No.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000]  We will rise.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]  And we will lift.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]  All right. Fight and you may die.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]  Run. Heal them.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]  At least a while.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:20.000]  And dying in your bed, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:28.000]  for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]  but they'll never take our freedom.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]  All right. It's our final segment with Stanley Hilton.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000]  I've been so honored to have him on the show with incredible revelations tonight.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]  Amazing courage. If more of us had it, we could save this country.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000]  This is a human cycle of tyranny and this one is waxing probably worse than ever seen in world history.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]  We must defeat it.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]  Let's talk to Dan in New York.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]  You're on the air with Stanley Hilton. Go ahead, Dan.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]  Hi. It's an honor to talk to you both.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]  I'm from Lowtown, New York, the hometown of your good friend, Bill O'Reilly, actually.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]  And I watched the road of tyranny and I've been visiting it for wars quite often lately.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000]  And ever since 9-11, I've been a patriot and I've loved this country so much.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]  And I see what Bush has been doing and it's been making me sick.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000]  I mean, I'm 18 years old and I know kids in my school, they just don't care about this kind of stuff.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]  And it doesn't faze them. They don't see the big danger.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.000]  They're going to care when they get drafted to serve in Homeland Army in the 63 countries, 62 countries they want to hit.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]  Mr. Hilton?
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:50.000]  Yes. They'll care if they get handed an M-16 and a cocky pants and a uniform to go out, you know,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000]  and fight for senseless wars in Iraq, Israel, or whatever,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]  for something that has nothing to do with Americans' security.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]  No, I totally agree with you.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]  And what I wanted to call about is the National History Day was this past Sunday.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]  I wrote a paper that was kind of anti-war.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]  I basically said that the Gulf War was about oil and then this is the whole entire motive behind the war.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]  And the judge kind of shut me out.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]  I mean, they were nice. They weren't mean people. I'm not going to hold it against them.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]  But they were pretty biased.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000]  Oh, yeah, and some public schools in the East, there's been several articles,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:30.000]  they say pro-peace papers are hurting the children of military people's feelings, so those won't be allowed now.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:37.000]  Well, you know, there was, I tell you, as far as the war is concerned, you know,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000]  there was a Congressman up there in Northern Virginia that was attacked by the media,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.000]  the mainstream media just a few days ago, because he said this war is about Israel.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]  And he was, of course, immediately accused of being anti-Semitic, etc., etc., blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000]  And so, you know, not only are you accused of being a terrorist and of being anti-government,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000]  but you're accused of being an anti-Semite if you just exercise your freedom of speech about what's going on.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000]  Again, Stanley Hilton, former chief counsel for Bob Dole, and I think he pointed it out well.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]  You oppose the tyranny of Communist Russia, the tyranny of Adolf Hitler, the tyranny of Bush,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]  the tyranny of Israel, the tyranny of Iraq, any of these countries.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]  But you're right, you're not even supposed to just criticize.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:27.000]  And I'm angry at Israel saying they're going to assassinate American citizens without a trial here in America.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]  I mean, we'd be mad if the Chinese said they'd do that.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000]  We'd be mad if the Mexican troops, which are doing that, by the way, they've got bounties on Border Patrol's heads.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]  But Israel can do it, and it is wrong.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]  And that is happening, and I agree we should speak out against it.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000]  And I think the left wing should get more focused on making the U.N. the big authority,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000]  because it's all controlled as well, but pointing out this whole, as you said, this shadow world government,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000]  this world fascist state, is using these organs. Anything else, Dan?
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000]  I just wanted to say that, I mean, I feel really bad that I'm kind of like, my generation, they just don't care about it.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]  Apathetic, yeah, apathetic.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]  It really is.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]  Well, look, it was 5% that won the Revolutionary War in 1776.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]  It was 2% that started it, sir.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]  So, believe me, our numbers, Stanley, wouldn't you say our numbers are probably 10%, 15%?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]  Yeah, minorities have always wielded the cutting edge of history, you know.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]  It's always been a minority.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000]  Even if you look at the Bolsheviki, or the Nazis, you start out with seven people that were revolutionary people.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]  There were very few who were adamantly against the British tyranny.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]  That's true. Minorities have always wielded the cutting edge of history.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000]  Yeah, so you don't want, I mean, I don't mean to be mean, but somebody watching American Idol drooling,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.000]  drinking whiskey, or snorting cocaine, those poor, sad people, we're trying to protect their rights.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]  They'll never thank us. But it doesn't matter. We're protecting our family and our children.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000]  Thanks for the call, Dan.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000]  No problem.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]  Yeah, I mean, people start talking about torturing kids. I come out against them. It's that simple.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]  Well, it's being done in the Middle East every day now, you know.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]  The Palestinians are being tortured and murdered every day, so it's nothing new.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]  Well, I've seen the video of them shooting five-year-old kids, and it's wrong.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]  And then you find out Israel founded Hamas. That's Yitzhak Rabin. That's not me.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]  The Shiite Press International.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]  Let's talk to Kevin in Pennsylvania. Kevin, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]  Good evening, Alex. And I'd like to say hi to your guests.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000]  And I'd also like to say to the gentleman that called right before me that I am part of your generation.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]  I'm 23 years old, and I see it.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]  Alex, and I haven't been able to get your video yet, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000]  But guess what? I found a way to hook my shortwave radio into my stereo,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000]  so I can just snap off the back of it and hook the speaker wire to the two terminals of the speaker
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]  and then hook it into the in-jacks of the tape deck.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000]  And it tapes it in stereo, even though the radio only broke it. It comes out mono.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]  So I can start giving out your programs.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]  That is a great thing to do. You also want to call a local station and get them to...
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000]  I'm going to do better. I'm going to send tapes of it to the local radio stations of your programs
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]  and figure out which ones that I tape are the best, most compelling.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]  Also, I'd like to say that I saw a little advertisement on the Weather Channel for Homeland Security,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000]  1-800-BE-READY, and I called that up, and I played them,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:25.000]  and I played the number that you call for the makers of the Mark of the Beast,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]  probably digital. I played them in your commercial.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]  Well, I just want to say something about this so-called Homeland...
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]  I call it Homeland Insecurity, because that's the real purpose.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]  Well, I call it the Department of the New World Order.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's a Nazi term.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000]  Yeah. Homeland Insecurity, the purpose is to make Americans insecure, not secure.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000]  Let me just tell you this briefly. The lady that was married to one of the hijackers,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000]  she has been interviewed by the FBI 30 times and has told them various things
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000]  which they have then used for this orange alert and red alert.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000]  She's actually shown me how they've used some things that were totally made up.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]  This is a complete fraud.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000]  Nothing happened when they put out the alert. I think that was because they knew people were like...
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]  They went on edge.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]  That's when they blow stuff up. They go, see, we warned you.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]  Now when there's an orange alert, we're going to lock the cities down.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]  Washington Post reported on this.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]  Oh, I heard about it on a radio station in my area.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:28.000]  Hold on, let me tell you this. Under a red alert, your children will be taken at school to a FEMA center.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]  You won't be allowed to get them. Go ahead.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]  That's what they were saying. There's a school around here.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]  They're going, oh, terrorism. Well, we've got to keep food and supplies.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]  They're saying they might not let you get your kids at this one school.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]  Let me just tell you, one of the people we've interviewed for the case is a former top official at FEMA
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000]  who was there during the Reagan administration and the first Bush administration.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000]  FEMA, being one of the agencies that was swinging to action in the event of an emergency,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000]  has blueprints for establishing martial law in this country.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000]  Mr. Hilton, hold on. We posted mainstream news articles last week
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000]  where they admit giant one million man concentration camps with, this is Rocky Mountain News,
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]  with incinerators and mass graves already ready.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]  Taking some hitler, huh?
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]  Let me tell you, Mr. Hilton, I'm not joking. I can see the article.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]  I believe it. I believe it.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]  Are you pushing the Antichrist or do you think it's my trade out of life?
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000]  No, sir. I don't get into all those weird groups.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000]  I know. I go coast to coast. I emailed them to get you on.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]  Well, I appreciate it.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]  I'm doing all I can to fight the New World Order I am.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]  All right, bro. Thanks for the call.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.000]  The poor folks in Rwanda when the U.N. was killing them thought that it was the Antichrist
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]  and they were about to get raptured out. It didn't happen.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000]  Same thing with Hitler, folks. God helps those that help themselves.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]  I believe in God. I'm a Christian.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]  But I believe we've got to, these phony churches have been infiltrated by the government
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000]  and they're telling you to lay down and we've got to say no to that.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000]  Well, the other thing I want to say about the rapture and eschatology and so on is that
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000]  a lot of these right-wing churches support Israel because they feel that the Bible gives them
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]  the right to expand the Nile to the Euphrates and beyond.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]  It's just another propaganda ploy to support our going out there and dying for Israel
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]  because the Bible says so.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000]  Now, I don't think, I mean, this idea that Jesus will come with a rapture tomorrow
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]  if we support Israel today, we've got Armageddon around the corner.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]  I mean, this is nonsense. This is just a complete sham.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000]  But why do all the right-wing evangelical Christians support this state?
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]  But hold on, they're not right-wing, Pat. They're neo-cons.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]  Well, not only, yeah, cons as in con artists.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.000]  But I mean, the point is that why are you supporting a country that's anti-Christian?
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000]  I mean, it's not only anti-Christian, but that it's attempted to shut down Christmas,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000]  take away Christmas trees, et cetera, et cetera, you know, national holiday,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000]  take away the crosses in cities. I mean, this is what we're fighting for.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000]  Absolutely, and that's why Yitzhak Rabin was killed because he wouldn't go along with it.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000]  And I would add to that that it's this global body.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000]  It's the large central banks, and they're made up of the Bushes, the Dutch, the British.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000]  It's all connected. Let's take some more calls.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000]  Up next is only two more calls, and we've got to let our guests go.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]  Rich in Maryland, go ahead. You're on the air.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]  Hey, you guys are right on target tonight.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000]  And Stanley, you're right about the term dual loyalists. This is a little generous.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000]  They are Israeli firsters, and these Zionists are running the show.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000]  And, Alex, you're right that, you know, they're going after the Arabs now,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000]  but next it's going to be, guess what, the white people.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000]  Yeah, well, the Arabs are not really Muslim fanatics as is presented.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000]  As I said earlier from the eyewitness, these people are more interested in Playboy than in the Koran.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.000]  Well, let me just say this. I don't come up with this comment out of nowhere.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000]  I look at the FBI training manuals. I have them on tape. I have them on video.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.000]  And when I say white people, I want racist white America that goes, oh, yeah, Bush, kill them Arabs, kill them.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:28.000]  You know, it's acceptable to have radio promos where it goes, look at them camels run, look at them rag heads.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:34.000]  That's on national radio. That type of racism is acceptable, and I think it's disgusting.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000]  And then they'll come back, well, I want white America to know that what FEMA is creating,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:46.000]  what they're training police is Christians, gun owners, homeschoolers, those that believe in the second coming of Christ.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000]  This is, I have it in my film, their documents, their news articles, them on video.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000]  I want people to know that this Homeland Security deal that they want to merge and blame the right wing,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000]  the real right wing, not the neo-cons, with Oklahoma City, connecting it to Iraqis.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:08.000]  You just heard Stanley Yilton interview government officials, has the depositions, knows that these Muslims that were hired
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000]  were there at World Trade Center 1, 2, and Oklahoma City. That's the frame up.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]  So that's what they're doing. Go ahead, Rich.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:24.000]  Yeah, and I think in the end, you know, what we're looking at here, this thing is going to be, you know,
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000]  they've got up to, what, 500,000 foreign troops they're planning to put here?
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]  Let me tell you something about that. He's a very intelligent man, and he's written books on this subject,
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:40.000]  and again, Bob Dole's chief counsel, but I have AP, Reuters, CBC, Washington Post.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000]  This sounds so crazy, it's not my opinion. It's just like the incinerators. I can't believe them.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]  Or torturing kids. I mean, they're saying all this.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:53.000]  It is in my film, Rota Terney, Masha Ter, both of them, where they say, they've signed deals to bring Dutch,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:00.000]  Czech Republic, Mexican, Canadian, British, and yes, Israeli, all these people here.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000]  And I've been a training officer. They trained to put us in camps.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000]  They've signed the deals to bring them in to quote, deal with American terrorists.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]  Mr. Hilton, have you heard about that?
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:15.000]  Yes, I have. I mean, I think that I've heard from the person that I mentioned before that was in FEMA.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:22.000]  There's definitely an agenda here. I mean, this is something that's truly, I think, of a world historical significance
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:28.000]  with what's down the line here. I mean, this is not a minor thing. This is not about finding who caused 7-11.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000]  We know who did. He's sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania. That's where he is. I mean, we know who did it.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000]  But no, this is all about this larger entity, what they're trying to do.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:46.000]  This is, if you look again from a historical perspective, there have been others in history who have similar goals.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:54.000]  These ones, though, have high technology, and they're pulling the wool over Americans' eyes with the media acts, the mass media acts, as I call them.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000]  And their napping gun has been their economic warfare tool to get everybody economically dependent.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:06.000]  Oh, yeah. I think the attempt, the Bush depression is intentional. It's not negligent. As incompetent as Bush is, I don't think it's negligent.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:13.000]  I think it's intentional to wreck this country's economy in order to make the people more dependent, more scared, more insecure.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000]  And the Department of Homeland Insecurity will extend to economic insecurity.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:25.000]  And then they're going to have national service in the new bill. There's a new bill for compulsory national service, and you will all get jobs from the government.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:34.000]  They've even said it. I watched a Homeland Security meeting with Ridge on C-SPAN, and he said it. He said they're going to have troops in the factories.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000]  Now, Alex, what they're going to do is they're going to do the man behind the screen thing. You know what I mean?
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000]  The Wizard of Oz thing, they're going to have, let's say, half a million, 500,000 foreign troops.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000]  Okay. You've got 285 million people. Most of them are armed.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:56.000]  The problem is we're all balkanized fighting with each other, but it's true. A motivated minority of us can defeat this. Thanks for the call.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000]  But it takes telling the truth and getting involved. One last call for our guest, Stanley Hilton, who I really want to thank for coming on the show.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000]  Rhonda in Missouri, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:14.000]  Evening, gentlemen. Thank you guys for all your work. That was Congressman Moran that made that statement. He since apologized for it.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000]  Of course. Under pressure from Bush.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000]  Yeah.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:26.000]  Whose father was arrested for funding the Nazis running almost all their operations again?
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000]  Yeah.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:34.000]  You know, this rapture cult kind of fits in good with the fatherland security because when people start disappearing, they can blame it on the rapture.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000]  We can't find them. I don't know where they are. God must have took them.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:46.000]  Well, in South America it's called desaparecidos, which means it disappeared. You have this in Chile and Argentina, et cetera.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:53.000]  Whole hundreds of thousands of people disappear and their families go marching around the central square on Saturday afternoons.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000]  I mean, that's what you're going to be seeing here pretty soon. People have disappeared and they're going to wonder where did they go.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:05.000]  And, you know, that's the goal here, to spread terror, to make you feel that unless you toe the line, you're going to be picked up next.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]  That's the ultimate form of power.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.000]  And if you give in to that, they win. We've got to stand up like Paul Revere and say, uh-uh, baby.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:20.000]  But, sir, what I want to ask you is in the Pozni military, how is our military feeling about what's happened?
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000]  Well, a lot of the military are very angry about what's happened. They don't like what they're seeing.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000]  The military are under, however, literally there is no democracy in the military.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:34.000]  There's no freedom of speech because, you know, you're basically a foot soldier, literally, in the army.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000]  So, you're the last person that was supposed to dissent.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.000]  Many of them are threatened. They're threatened with court-martials. They're not allowed to express freedom of speech.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:49.000]  I wish several would resign in protest to make a point, you know, like there was a fellow that resigned from the government.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000]  The ambassador.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000]  Yeah, right, the ambassador to make the point. But the military is a little different.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000]  The Washington Times reported the lowest morale ever, ever at the Pentagon.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  And if we, I know I spent 14 years in the service. I know if you don't speak their language, you've got to keep your mouth shut or they can throw you in the brig.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  Ronnie, we're almost out of time. I want to thank you for the call.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Okay.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  Mr. Hilton, thanks for coming on. Thanks for all your work. As the suit develops, can we have you back on?
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  Sure. Sure, I'll keep you posted. And we hope that we'll be able to bring these criminals to justice eventually,
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  because they ought to be not only in a civil lawsuit, but in a criminal court, in the dock.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  And I'm hoping that eventually they'll all be brought down.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  And you're right that it's a minority on the cutting edge of history. You're on that cutting edge.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  If we don't speak up now, our children won't have any future, will they?
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  We're out of time with Stanley Hilton. I'll be right back. Stay with us.
