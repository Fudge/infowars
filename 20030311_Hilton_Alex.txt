[00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:04.007]  We've got to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat here.
[00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:08.349]  Now I'm honored to have him on the show with his busy schedule.
[00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.731]  He's been in court all last week and all this week.
[00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:12.252]  We had him on about a year ago.
[00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:15.353]  He's Stanley Hilton.
[00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:16.554]  He was brutally attacked.
[00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:21.329]  By the mid-government pimps Hannity and Combs.
[00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:27.875]  He was a senior advisor to Bob Dole, counsel for Bob Dole and others in the Republican Party.
[00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:33.240]  He's an expert on government-sponsored terrorism, has written a book about it throughout history.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.086]  And he now has new revelations never before revealed from his depositions
[00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:44.268]  of witnesses involved in and around 9-1-1.
[00:00:44.268 --> 00:01:01.953]  He represents over 400 of the victims of 9-1-1's families, and he's been given almost no attention, while some of the other groups, headed by well-known PR bureaucrats, we've had them on the show as well, are trying to suppress this information.
[00:01:01.953 --> 00:01:03.473]  Joining us is Stanley Hilton.
[00:01:03.473 --> 00:01:05.574]  We're honored to have you on the show, Stanley.
[00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:06.074]  Glad to be here.
[00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:13.367]  Tell us just a little bit about yourself, your lawsuit, recap what we covered last year and the last year.
[00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:23.112]  Tell us what's developed with the lawsuit and the new revelations that you told me about on the phone.
[00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:33.518]  Well, we filed the lawsuit last May against Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld and several other of the, you know, Rice and the rest of the terrorists that run the U.S.
[00:01:33.518 --> 00:01:35.539]  government for complicity in
[00:01:36.147 --> 00:01:43.121]  Causing and also aiding and abetting the 9-1-1 attacks in order to promote their political agenda.
[00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:48.976]  And we're in the process, you know, these lawsuits, they come in ebbs and tides.
[00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:52.357]  They come and they go in terms of level activity.
[00:01:52.357 --> 00:01:57.438]  And most of it is done, you know, in confidential, what's called discovery litigation.
[00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:02.940]  That is, depositions under oath, battles in court to get documents.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.341]  We're facing very strong resistance from the government.
[00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:10.702]  They're claiming national security over everything, claiming they don't want to release documents, etc.
[00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:17.724]  But I'm representing people that are victimized by what the government did.
[00:02:17.724 --> 00:02:23.065]  We're also challenging the constitutionality of the so-called USA Patriot Act, as they call it.
[00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:25.506]  The Anti-Patriot Act, as I call it.
[00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:27.847]  And Patriot Act 1 and 2, with number 2,
[00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:36.149]  In the wings that the government plans to introduce this year, which will be even more severe than Patriot Act 1.
[00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:47.852]  And in this new one, Patriot Act 2, they're going to give Bush the right to declare any American citizen a, quote, enemy combatant, end quote, arbitrarily, and then take away your citizenship.
[00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:54.214]  This will give the government the power to literally strip any American of citizenship if Bush says you're an enemy combatant, i.e.
[00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.796]  political opponent of the government.
[00:02:56.796 --> 00:02:58.917]  So, anyway, all this is being brought out.
[00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:12.320]  We found some very interesting documents and memoranda, including several of those advisors around Bush, namely Wolfowitz, Wormser, Fyfe, Perl, the rest of them.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.281]  And they actually wrote these memos several months before 9-11, in which they
[00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.776]  Now this you told me last week before this was on ABC News
[00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:58.555]  That you have gotten some of this information through depositions and some other little tidbits that haven't been disclosed, but also you talked about how you've deposed, you've got the marriage certificates, the evidence, the photographs, a woman who was married to one of the hijackers, you talked to what you said six or eight people that were connected to them, and then we have the news articles where the FBI gave them homes, paid their rent,
[00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:00.056]  Follow them around.
[00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:02.839]  We know Israel was involved in similar things.
[00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:04.220]  Can you speak to that, please?
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.501]  Yes.
[00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:13.508]  Yes, I do have a witness who was married, an American woman, but she was married to one of the hijackers, and she knew about seven of them.
[00:04:13.508 --> 00:04:15.830]  She met seven of them.
[00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.893]  Essentially, these Arab hijackers were double agents.
[00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:22.784]  They were operating inside the U.S.
[00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:26.165]  for 10 to 15 years in, quote, cells, end quote.
[00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.346]  Some of them use the term Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:29.546]  They've used other terms.
[00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:31.407]  You know, that's just a word.
[00:04:31.407 --> 00:04:32.507]  Al-Qaeda is just a word.
[00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:34.968]  I mean, I could, you know, that means nothing.
[00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:37.948]  You could call them the Muslim Brotherhood, the Army of God.
[00:04:37.948 --> 00:04:40.229]  They go by all sorts of names, but what they are is
[00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:41.210]  I think so.
[00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:54.174]  We're good to go.
[00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.710]  You know, Muslims.
[00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.032]  I mean, they're more interested in Playboy than in the Quran.
[00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:17.752]  I mean, these people drink.
[00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:19.473]  They're very secular.
[00:05:19.473 --> 00:05:28.056]  They're not the fanatical Muslim zealot that the Bush criminals would let us believe is what's operating here.
[00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:31.137]  What they are is they receive regular payments from the U.S.
[00:05:31.137 --> 00:05:31.557]  government.
[00:05:31.557 --> 00:05:36.839]  They've been recruited by CIA, FBI, counterintelligence, and so forth, and paid money.
[00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.561]  And allowed to exchange information with U.S.
[00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.963]  government agents about various activities going on.
[00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:45.764]  Now let me stop you right there, Mr. Hilton.
[00:05:45.764 --> 00:05:49.607]  Everything you said was already backed up by mainstream reports.
[00:05:49.607 --> 00:05:53.869]  You've gotten it now in sworn testimony and depositions on the road.
[00:05:53.869 --> 00:06:06.197]  But something everybody wants to ignore is that three of the hijackers at least were trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station, not at a local airfield on the base by the government, at least.
[00:06:07.254 --> 00:06:15.241]  Now we find out eight of the hijackers under names we heard are still alive in the Middle East on television doing interviews.
[00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:17.483]  Their faces, their names, same people.
[00:06:17.483 --> 00:06:22.066]  We have then Mohammed Atta being sent over to the Defense Language School Monterey.
[00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:23.667]  You've talked to Stephen Butler.
[00:06:26.772 --> 00:06:30.673]  The Colonel there, the Dean of the school, so we know this.
[00:06:30.673 --> 00:06:44.978]  And then I have the stories on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the 9-1-1 archives, which is a great research tool for anybody, where they admit, you know, FBI paid for their houses, FBI lived with them, Mossad lived with them.
[00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:51.560]  Now you're saying double agents, and you're saying what we already had the pieces of here without your depositions, but it's a great confirmation
[00:06:52.501 --> 00:06:54.844]  That they're involved in World Trade Center 1 in 93.
[00:06:54.844 --> 00:06:58.088]  They're in Manhattan, Oklahoma City.
[00:06:58.088 --> 00:06:59.430]  But here's the deal.
[00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.936]  The FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, gave the guys the detonators in the first World Trade Center.
[00:07:03.936 --> 00:07:04.397]  We know that.
[00:07:04.397 --> 00:07:05.318]  That's the New York Times.
[00:07:05.948 --> 00:07:13.614]  We know that the feds were inside planting the bombs in Oklahoma City, and had these Iraqis outside with McVeigh.
[00:07:13.614 --> 00:07:28.206]  I've talked to the police, the FBI, so when you say double agent, I would venture to say that these are double agents who are still alive, who are just seen at the scene of the crime, while the globalists militarily carry out the attacks themselves.
[00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:30.248]  That's where the evidence points.
[00:07:30.248 --> 00:07:32.910]  But what you've proven, and what the news has proven,
[00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:42.534]  You know, the witness I was talking about personally met, there are two others, Mohammed and then he had a younger brother, and they're alleged to be two of the ones on the airliners.
[00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:57.520]  You know, the thing is, these individuals are, in my view, quote, taxis.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.980]  That is, they were paid by the government.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.981]  I don't believe that they themselves flew the planes into it.
[00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:18.323]  As I said previously, one of our allegations is that the government has this device that we codename Cyclops, that allows from an airbase nearby to disable the pilot's control of airliners and to fly them by remote control.
[00:08:18.323 --> 00:08:19.164]  Well, that's admitted.
[00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:20.304]  It's decades old.
[00:08:20.304 --> 00:08:21.304]  It's called Global Hawk.
[00:08:21.684 --> 00:08:23.285]  Yeah, Global Hawk, right.
[00:08:23.285 --> 00:08:26.267]  Of course, the government denies it's been, quote, deployed.
[00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:28.368]  They say they've got the technology, but they haven't deployed it.
[00:08:28.368 --> 00:08:29.589]  Let me stop you, let me stop you.
[00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:30.469]  This is really key, sir.
[00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:31.870]  We're so honored to have you.
[00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.292]  I've really studied this, and I want to give you, and you probably already have, but I want to reiterate it for listeners.
[00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:42.436]  Bush, two days after the attack, at a speech in New York, said, in the future, we can remote control these planes.
[00:08:43.036 --> 00:08:43.697]  I don't know.
[00:09:01.147 --> 00:09:14.980]  Suddenly, they had a cover story in two AP articles in New York Daily News, all in the film, where they said, oh, lo and behold, 8.30 in the morning, the CIA was running a drill of flying jetliners into buildings in New York and D.C.
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:23.848]  Just so happened, at that very minute, they were running this, and just so happened, NORAD stood down for an hour and a half to 58 minutes in different cases.
[00:09:23.848 --> 00:09:26.431]  I mean, it's incredible when you add all this together.
[00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:26.791]  Go ahead.
[00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:29.032]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:09:29.032 --> 00:09:34.794]  The official government party line is, their first line of defense is that technology is science fiction.
[00:09:34.794 --> 00:09:35.814]  It doesn't exist.
[00:09:35.814 --> 00:09:36.814]  But not the total lie.
[00:09:36.814 --> 00:09:45.617]  Anybody that works, and I've spoken to hundreds of mechanics and maintenance managers at United Airlines, American Airlines, several others.
[00:09:45.617 --> 00:09:47.558]  They all confirm that technology exists.
[00:09:47.558 --> 00:09:49.358]  Well, how do drones operate?
[00:09:49.358 --> 00:09:50.699]  The companies in Fort Worth.
[00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:52.846]  Sure, sure.
[00:09:52.846 --> 00:09:54.967]  The question is, has it been deployed?
[00:09:54.967 --> 00:09:56.508]  The answer is yes, it has.
[00:09:56.508 --> 00:10:10.717]  I have one witness who was on the very same United aircraft from Newark, New Jersey to San Francisco four days before the, uh, September 11th, and observed certain individuals on that plane who were then later acclaimed to be the hijackers.
[00:10:10.717 --> 00:10:14.119]  He was the observer speaking with a government agent.
[00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:15.280]  Is that Mr. Woods?
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.722]  Uh, I can't disclose names on that right now.
[00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:23.646]  And then he was threatened, because I don't know who it is, but Woods said... No, no, it's not Woods.
[00:10:23.646 --> 00:10:24.306]  It's someone else.
[00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:25.147]  Someone else.
[00:10:25.147 --> 00:10:26.327]  This is a civilian.
[00:10:26.327 --> 00:10:34.873]  But with Woods, the famous actor, he got off and said, and this is a problem, and the FBI came and said, you tell anybody about this, you're going to jail.
[00:10:34.873 --> 00:10:35.894]  Well, yes, that's right.
[00:10:35.894 --> 00:10:41.138]  The Anti-Patriot Act 1 and 2, as they call them, are the tools which
[00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:44.570]  Which, you know, are very similar to what happened in Nazi Germany.
[00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.591]  Hitler's enabling act after the Reichstag's fire gave them dictatorial power.
[00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:50.451]  That's the goal here at the end run.
[00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:53.132]  This is what we have to look at, what their purpose ultimately is.
[00:10:53.132 --> 00:11:00.194]  I mean, this attempt to invade Iraq now for no purpose is coming in, I guess, next week or the week after.
[00:11:01.034 --> 00:11:03.916]  You know, starting, this was planned long before 9-11.
[00:11:03.916 --> 00:11:06.878]  These people around Wolfowitz and so forth.
[00:11:06.878 --> 00:11:08.439]  I mean, I went to school with Wolfowitz.
[00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:15.583]  I was in the same university in the late 60s when he was very active with the Israelis over there at the University of Chicago and so forth.
[00:11:15.583 --> 00:11:16.984]  He was pursuing a PhD.
[00:11:16.984 --> 00:11:19.305]  And these people have an agenda.
[00:11:19.305 --> 00:11:22.647]  And, you know, it's not an agenda that helps the American people.
[00:11:22.647 --> 00:11:30.252]  It's an attempt to use this country and its power to wreck this country in service of another nefarious and ulterior goal.
[00:11:30.812 --> 00:11:33.275]  Now, Mr. Hilton, there's a lot to cover.
[00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:35.217]  Can we just go through your depositions?
[00:11:35.217 --> 00:11:36.618]  And this is incredibly dangerous.
[00:11:36.618 --> 00:11:41.342]  You have incredible, amazing honor and will.
[00:11:41.342 --> 00:11:42.383]  And I mean this, sir.
[00:11:42.383 --> 00:11:43.625]  God bless you.
[00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:45.466]  People like you are going to save this country.
[00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:47.568]  Your witnesses do.
[00:11:47.568 --> 00:11:49.871]  You know what you're doing is very, very dangerous.
[00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:51.572]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:11:51.572 --> 00:11:53.534]  I hope you have large life insurance policies.
[00:11:55.246 --> 00:11:55.887]  I need them too.
[00:11:55.887 --> 00:12:01.713]  Well, no, what you're really doing, Pierce is the veil and you're on target, but there's so many of us now, it's while they're on the run and we're on the march.
[00:12:01.713 --> 00:12:04.455]  Go down some of the key stuff you've got in depositions.
[00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:07.639]  I don't want to give your whole case away because they listen to it.
[00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:08.299]  Right.
[00:12:08.299 --> 00:12:14.986]  Well, as I mentioned, the individual on the aircraft that was later hijacked, four days later, same flight, same destination.
[00:12:16.307 --> 00:12:24.859]  Newark to San Francisco, what he observed and what others on that plane, including United flight attendants, observed.
[00:12:24.859 --> 00:12:29.404]  These individuals, four days later, were said to be on the planes that crashed it.
[00:12:29.404 --> 00:12:31.547]  And they're government-controlled.
[00:12:31.547 --> 00:12:34.211]  And this term is tradecraft, meaning
[00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:39.993]  Basically, spying, counter-spying, and one of the terms of tradecraft is control, the agent that controls.
[00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:48.157]  These Arabs that were alleged to have done it had controls, and some of our discoveries have identified some of these people.
[00:12:48.157 --> 00:12:50.438]  They're FBI and CIA agents.
[00:12:50.438 --> 00:12:57.741]  So they had control, actual agents or case officers, and then they had their little minion drones with them.
[00:12:58.401 --> 00:13:00.582]  Yeah, these people operate in cells.
[00:13:00.582 --> 00:13:04.544]  The cells are from 6 to 12 individuals, and the cells move around.
[00:13:04.544 --> 00:13:08.165]  For instance, from Portland, Oregon to San Diego is just one example.
[00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:11.186]  They didn't move all 6 or 12 of them by chance.
[00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:13.047]  They were instructed to do it.
[00:13:13.047 --> 00:13:18.189]  There are locations or schools or apartments, etc., that were bought here.
[00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:26.652]  Again, this is from a direct eyewitness on this, and this has been verified with marriage certificate documents, photographs with Bin Laden and his brothers.
[00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:28.233]  Paid for by the U.S.
[00:13:28.233 --> 00:13:29.635]  government, that's official.
[00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:33.478]  Associated Press, Washington Post, and they just kind of brush that over.
[00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:41.266]  See, the thing is that you look back in 93 and 95, Oklahoma City, World Trade Center, you say, well, Clinton was in power, whereas now it's Bush.
[00:13:41.266 --> 00:13:43.148]  So you say, well, how could it be the same players here?
[00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:51.677]  The answer is that the shadow government transcends individual political puppets that occupy 1600 Pennsylvania.
[00:13:51.677 --> 00:13:55.181]  I mean, you know, it doesn't really make much difference whether it's Clinton or Bush.
[00:13:55.181 --> 00:14:00.107]  There are other... The shadow government, as I call it, essentially is, you know, continuous.
[00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:04.732]  And these bureaucrats that you've got there in the Pentagon, State Department, White House, etc.
[00:14:06.455 --> 00:14:11.202]  They stay on from administration to administration pursuing a certain agenda.
[00:14:11.202 --> 00:14:13.286]  I think this is all part of a pattern.
[00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:15.389]  The latest example manifestation was 9-11.
[00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:23.637]  You've got that, you've got the anthrax attacks, which happened conveniently right after 9-11.
[00:14:23.637 --> 00:14:28.062]  Well, that turns out, most weaponized form of anthrax ever seen, U.S.
[00:14:28.062 --> 00:14:35.991]  government patented design at micron, incredibly small levels, coded in bentonite,
[00:14:36.744 --> 00:14:37.224]  Yeah.
[00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:37.365]  Yeah.
[00:14:37.365 --> 00:14:37.505]  Yeah.
[00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:08.425]  RU Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:08.425 --> 00:15:12.307]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:15:12.307 --> 00:15:19.030]  Alright, I know we've got loaded phone lines and we'll take your calls for Mr. Hilton in the next hour.
[00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.612]  Again, this guy knows what he's talking about.
[00:15:22.612 --> 00:15:25.533]  He's worked in some of the highest levels of the U.S.
[00:15:25.533 --> 00:15:26.614]  government in the U.S.
[00:15:26.614 --> 00:15:27.294]  Senate.
[00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:28.875]  He's counseled Bob Dole.
[00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:31.418]  He's a good American.
[00:15:31.418 --> 00:15:34.082]  He knows tyranny when he sees it.
[00:15:34.082 --> 00:15:35.003]  Same thing with me.
[00:15:35.003 --> 00:15:38.850]  You know, again, I've been a Republican for years, but I'm not this type of Republican.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.202]  I love America, the Bill of Rights.
[00:15:41.202 --> 00:15:48.368]  These neocons are the worst of Stalin and Hitler rolled into one, and I'm not using those terms for effect.
[00:15:48.368 --> 00:15:49.849]  These are scary people.
[00:15:49.849 --> 00:16:01.839]  Mr. Hilton, from your experience, what type of groups, people, the shadow government, which they just announced, remember, last year, that we've known about for years, and what does the shadow government want this world to be like?
[00:16:03.274 --> 00:16:11.442]  Basically, a one-world globalist tyranny controlled by them, of course, and neocons, neoconservatives, so-called.
[00:16:11.442 --> 00:16:18.249]  But they're not really conservatives, they're radicals, because they're seeking a radical destruction of our way of life for the last 200 years.
[00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:23.935]  They're basically introducing an alien, anti-American form of tyranny, which has more to do with
[00:16:24.575 --> 00:16:30.077]  Oh, Europe and Asia, then it has to do with this country.
[00:16:30.077 --> 00:16:34.099]  The ultimate goal, of course, is to advance their own agenda.
[00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:42.542]  Certainly, expansion of Israel's borders from the Nile to the Euphrates, as they say the Bible mandates, is certainly a major goal, no question about it.
[00:16:43.022 --> 00:16:46.524]  Emulation of Sharon's government in Israel turned the U.S.
[00:16:46.524 --> 00:16:50.065]  into sort of a super Israel, I think, is another purpose.
[00:16:50.065 --> 00:17:03.271]  And if you look at what's going on now with the propaganda wall, this 9-11 service, and exaggerations and lies and so forth by these criminals around Bush, you know, that is certainly aimed at the agenda.
[00:17:03.271 --> 00:17:07.672]  Territorial expansion of Israel in the Middle East, the major goal is no question about it.
[00:17:07.672 --> 00:17:10.994]  You know, that's a key motive I haven't talked enough about, but we do have
[00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:34.866]  The trillions of dollars of oil, the weapons sales, the 1.7 to 1.9 trillion cost of a five-year occupation paid into the Carlaw Group and others, the domestic police state crackdown, the smokescreen for economic collapse while they consolidate, while they suck in Ron and other companies dry, and they can declare national security on investigations of that.
[00:17:34.866 --> 00:17:40.169]  But I would agree with you about Israel because what makes me lean more towards what you're saying is that
[00:17:40.649 --> 00:17:40.909]  That's right.
[00:17:50.643 --> 00:17:57.808]  The announcement three months ago by Reuters, by Israel, the government's going to let us kill American citizens in America.
[00:17:57.808 --> 00:18:01.270]  No judge, no jury, no nothing, they're just going to kill us.
[00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:11.157]  And now James Weapons, this is mainstream, the big world weapons tracker, came out about Israel and other, sort of the Times of London,
[00:18:11.869 --> 00:18:17.094]  With race-specific viruses and bacteria that kill other races other than themselves.
[00:18:17.094 --> 00:18:20.176]  That is the ultimate of Hitlerian-type activities.
[00:18:20.176 --> 00:18:23.519]  Well, you know, the term that's been used has been Zion-Nazis.
[00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.861]  I think it's an apt term, Zion-Nazis.
[00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:36.771]  And I think it's ironic because, you know, the Nazis based their theory on the, quote, protocols of the elders of Zion, which are alleged to be a shake by the Czar claiming that Jews wanted world conquest.
[00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:46.920]  Now we've got the complete reverse where the current Zion Nazis in Israel and their friends here in the Bush administration and elsewhere are emulating the Hitler.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.540]  That's right.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.202]  It comes full circle.
[00:18:49.202 --> 00:18:50.343]  Essentially it's the same thing.
[00:18:50.343 --> 00:18:54.747]  Whether you call them Jews or non-Jews, the point is it's the same ideology.
[00:18:54.747 --> 00:18:58.210]  Tyranny... Yeah, it could be Chinese, you know, you said the Asian model.
[00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:58.731]  Sure.
[00:18:58.731 --> 00:19:03.575]  I mean, it's just old-fashioned, you know, Egyptian, Babylonian, ancient tyranny.
[00:19:03.795 --> 00:19:04.975]  Yeah.
[00:19:04.975 --> 00:19:06.336]  Hitler used the word Jew.
[00:19:06.336 --> 00:19:08.436]  Today the word we're using is terrorist.
[00:19:08.436 --> 00:19:11.137]  This term terrorist can apply to anybody.
[00:19:11.137 --> 00:19:17.959]  As I said, they're attempting to legalize it just as Hitler had the 1935 Nuremberg Laws outlawed Jews.
[00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:21.520]  Well, now they're trying to come up with anti-patriot laws too.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:28.564]  To outlaw any kind of dissent and to call you a terrorist if you attack Bush or these criminals around him, these alien criminals.
[00:19:28.564 --> 00:19:31.206]  And I think that the agenda is clear.
[00:19:31.206 --> 00:19:35.769]  It's to turn American people into Palestinian slaves.
[00:19:35.769 --> 00:19:42.754]  I mean, that's what it seems to me, just as the Israelis are treating the Palestinians there as subhumans.
[00:19:42.754 --> 00:19:47.177]  And then to legitimize that, they founded Hamas, which is now admitted.
[00:19:47.177 --> 00:19:48.237]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:48.237 --> 00:19:48.678]  Stay with us.
[00:19:50.888 --> 00:19:53.030]  Is the lack of privacy bugging you?
[00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.652]  Peace of mind is now within your reach.
[00:19:55.652 --> 00:20:04.079]  The bug detector offers state-of-the-art protection.
[00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.400]  Big Brother.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.181]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:07.181 --> 00:20:08.342]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:10.524]  You want answers?
[00:20:10.524 --> 00:20:12.065]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:12.065 --> 00:20:16.249]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:20.352]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20:23.877 --> 00:20:39.510]  Whether it's Adolf Hitler or Saddam Hussein, the Globalists, the New World Order, has funded and trained them to bring you the crises so they can offer their solution to world government.
[00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.551]  We're talking to Stanley Hilton.
[00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:45.094]  He is the lawyer for over 400 of the victims' families of 9-1-1.
[00:20:45.094 --> 00:20:48.617]  He's suing the government not just for prior knowledge, but for complicity.
[00:20:48.617 --> 00:20:51.259]  He now, to recap, has the evidence from depositions
[00:20:52.074 --> 00:20:54.736]  Government agents, you name it.
[00:20:54.736 --> 00:20:59.719]  Wives of supposed hijackers that they were paid, funded, housed, protected by the U.S.
[00:20:59.719 --> 00:21:00.380]  government.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.342]  That's all come out in mainstream news, but a piece here, a piece there.
[00:21:03.342 --> 00:21:05.544]  Oh, the FBI had a strange twist.
[00:21:05.544 --> 00:21:08.105]  Owned the houses where the hijackers lived and paid them.
[00:21:08.105 --> 00:21:12.468]  In another twist, they were trained in a secret military program at Pensacola.
[00:21:12.468 --> 00:21:13.409]  On and on and on.
[00:21:13.409 --> 00:21:13.629]  L.A.
[00:21:13.629 --> 00:21:14.890]  Times before the attacks.
[00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.052]  Bush sends $134 million to the Taliban.
[00:21:17.992 --> 00:21:19.193]  They're in business together.
[00:21:19.193 --> 00:21:27.020]  The Bin Ladens are in satellites and oil, and they just bought the Carlisle Group, Universal Studios, and they're buying up radio networks and TV.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:31.003]  And you've got all this happening, and you add it all together.
[00:21:32.513 --> 00:21:38.497]  Mr. Hilton, did you hear him talk about how torture is good and as if that's not enough of terrorist suspects?
[00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:49.024]  Now they want to torture terrorist suspects' children, but the Patriot Act in Section 802 says that any action that endangers human life is a violation of any federal or state law.
[00:21:49.024 --> 00:21:57.330]  As a lawyer, as Bob Dole's former chief counsel, what does that mean when the definition is any action that endangers human life that's a violation of federal or state law?
[00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.812]  This isn't just going to be the Arabs that get tortured, is it?
[00:22:02.194 --> 00:22:07.659]  Black checked for the government to completely destroy democracy and torture any dissenter.
[00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:21.612]  You know, Alan Dershowitz, the so-called professor of law at Harvard, which is my alma mater, Harvard University Law School, he's the one that's coming out with, of course, this calling for torture.
[00:22:21.612 --> 00:22:24.435]  I believe he testified before a Senate committee a few weeks ago.
[00:22:24.435 --> 00:22:25.937]  Stick needles under their fingers.
[00:22:26.557 --> 00:22:39.567]  Well, you know, uh, him and his book of chutzpah and elsewhere, uh, there's another Israeli firster, uh, dual loyalist, but, you know, oh, I should say, I don't know if I'd even use the term dual loyalist, I'd rather, uh, I think Israeli loyalist.
[00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:40.928]  I mean, these are the people behind it.
[00:22:40.928 --> 00:22:41.469]  They use that word.
[00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:42.609]  Well, it is bizarre.
[00:22:42.609 --> 00:22:47.533]  It was, uh, Abrams on the Abrams Report on MSNBC said, let's torture people's children.
[00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:54.819]  I mean, I'm sorry, torturing children is wrong, and we are seeing this unified Nazi-like weird race thing.
[00:22:54.819 --> 00:22:55.039]  Yeah.
[00:22:55.498 --> 00:23:00.821]  Well, you know, this is, I hope this will backfire on them, because this is outrageous.
[00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:10.245]  It's an attempt to, you know, there's a word in Hebrew called goyim, G-O-Y-I-M, which means non-Jews, and it means cattle, is what it means.
[00:23:10.245 --> 00:23:12.346]  And so, I think that summarizes it all.
[00:23:12.346 --> 00:23:14.087]  You know, you torture the cattle.
[00:23:14.087 --> 00:23:14.967]  What difference does it make?
[00:23:14.967 --> 00:23:16.028]  They're not the master race.
[00:23:16.028 --> 00:23:21.210]  You know, you cannot have first-class citizenship in Israel unless you're born from a Jewish mother.
[00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.311]  Now, if that's not racism, you tell me what it is.
[00:23:23.311 --> 00:23:24.692]  These are the people we're dying for.
[00:23:25.848 --> 00:23:27.750]  I mean, that's the law of Israel.
[00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:33.475]  You know, you can be born in Milwaukee, and as long as your mother's Jewish, you can become an Israeli citizen.
[00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:37.778]  But if you're born in Jerusalem and you don't have a Jewish mother, you can't.
[00:23:37.778 --> 00:23:39.440]  Now you tell me if that's not racist.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:46.065]  Israel's got a big problem because the left wing has woken up to the incredible racism we're dealing with here.
[00:23:47.266 --> 00:23:53.430]  And whether it's Hitler or Jiang Zemin or Israel involved in all this, it's wrong.
[00:23:53.430 --> 00:24:01.455]  Now, and when they're saying they're going to come in here and kill American citizens with no trial, I mean, if it was Russians doing that, would we put up with it?
[00:24:01.455 --> 00:24:03.476]  Well, you know, Russia is, I guess, our friend now.
[00:24:03.476 --> 00:24:05.697]  You know, Bush is cozying up to Putin now.
[00:24:05.697 --> 00:24:12.021]  I guess, you know, they say Chechnya, the genocide in Chechnya is okay because there are terrorists there.
[00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:12.962]  I mean, you know,
[00:24:13.542 --> 00:24:15.103]  Why are these people suddenly our friends?
[00:24:15.103 --> 00:24:17.604]  I thought the whole Cold War for 50 years was their thing.
[00:24:17.604 --> 00:24:24.368]  And by the way, Putin got his war, he was caught blowing up apartment buildings, that's mainstream news.
[00:24:24.368 --> 00:24:28.610]  Blaming it on the Chechens.
[00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.912]  Putin is just another version of the Russian czars and the commissars and so on.
[00:24:32.912 --> 00:24:39.656]  And now these people are being presented as friends, and Bush is saying he's looking into this fellow's eyes and seeing a great man.
[00:24:39.656 --> 00:24:41.357]  I mean, Putin is an executive.
[00:24:41.557 --> 00:24:43.038]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:24:43.038 --> 00:24:45.298]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:45.298 --> 00:24:48.620]  We're talking to Stanley Hilton, Chief Counsel to Bob Dole.
[00:25:11.198 --> 00:25:18.321]  One of the architects of the Strategic Petroleum Initiative, to get that set up.
[00:25:18.321 --> 00:25:22.822]  And he of course is a Harvard graduate.
[00:25:22.822 --> 00:25:26.803]  He represents 400 of the victims' families, according to press reports.
[00:25:26.803 --> 00:25:28.744]  Over 400 of the victims' families of 9-1-1.
[00:25:28.744 --> 00:25:31.065]  And he isn't charging prior knowledge.
[00:25:31.065 --> 00:25:32.545]  He has the evidence.
[00:25:32.545 --> 00:25:33.966]  He's done the depositions.
[00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:37.672]  On the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:37.672 --> 00:25:39.635]  Confirmed by news articles that already came out.
[00:25:39.635 --> 00:25:41.839]  He just went and documented it for himself.
[00:25:42.871 --> 00:25:48.035]  The FBI and CIA handles and controls radical Islam.
[00:25:48.035 --> 00:26:04.689]  Yusak Rabin, right before he was assassinated by Mossad, who's a good man for telling the truth, said, I apologize, he said at Tel Aviv University, the Jerusalem Post reported, for the fact that Israel founded Hamas to destabilize the region so there can never be a true peace.
[00:26:04.689 --> 00:26:06.310]  So, whether it's Bush
[00:26:07.038 --> 00:26:09.724]  Or the Communist Chinese or the Radical Israelis.
[00:26:09.724 --> 00:26:12.029]  These globalists need crises.
[00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:13.272]  They want war.
[00:26:13.272 --> 00:26:14.394]  They want slavery.
[00:26:14.394 --> 00:26:15.757]  They want this to happen.
[00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:27.701]  And it's happening, whether you're a Sachs-Koburg, Goethe-German like Bush, or Ariel Sharon, they're all together in this New World Order.
[00:26:27.701 --> 00:26:35.367]  And look, when they start talking about torturing terrorist suspects' children, and assassinating Americans, that's when I come out and say no.
[00:26:35.367 --> 00:26:42.053]  Now, I know we've got Andy, and Jackie, and Gordon, and Dan, and Kevin, they've all been holding on wanting to talk to you.
[00:26:42.053 --> 00:26:44.375]  Any other key depositions you've done,
[00:26:45.475 --> 00:26:51.796]  Not just with military officers or witnesses of the Feds protecting the hijackers on planes and training them.
[00:26:51.796 --> 00:26:56.797]  Or people inside the airlines with the Global Hawk on these aircraft.
[00:26:56.797 --> 00:26:57.817]  All of this.
[00:26:57.817 --> 00:26:58.537]  Break it down.
[00:26:58.537 --> 00:27:03.158]  Any other key smoking gun pieces of evidence and where's your lawsuit going?
[00:27:03.158 --> 00:27:10.219]  I've read in the press the government's declaring national security on that and on the firefighter tapes that were reporting bombs going off.
[00:27:10.219 --> 00:27:11.860]  They first said all the tapes malfunctioned.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.560]  Turns out they're all there, grabbed by Bush.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.421]  Can you break all this down for us?
[00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:17.523]  Any other key areas?
[00:27:17.523 --> 00:27:30.934]  Yeah, well, there's a lot of this that I can't really talk about on the air for obvious reasons, but I think the evidence is building and we're going to eventually get it out in the light of day in a public trial, which we hope to bring next year here in the federal court.
[00:27:30.934 --> 00:27:36.658]  And also, you know, it's part of a larger agenda, but what's really going on is we hope
[00:27:37.899 --> 00:27:43.506]  Examine the constitutionality of this anti-patriot act because it's clearly unconstitutional.
[00:27:43.506 --> 00:27:47.250]  The Eighth Amendment says you can't use cruel and unusual punishment.
[00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:52.997]  Dershowitz and pals and his friends around Bush, of course, don't think that means a damn thing.
[00:27:53.677 --> 00:27:57.239]  And they want to bring about a lawless society under the guise of laws.
[00:27:57.239 --> 00:27:57.960]  Lawless.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:11.488]  And it's really largely political, but I think the evidence, the evidence will show that these criminals have not only got to be removed from power, but brought to justice for their crimes, including mass murder and attempt to destroy this country's democracy.
[00:28:11.488 --> 00:28:19.012]  Well, I would say our constitutional republic, and Mr. Hilton, I would add to that, that across the board here,
[00:28:19.821 --> 00:28:24.565]  You read Patriot Act 2, and I've written an analysis of it on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:24.565 --> 00:28:35.633]  I mean, it says they can grab you for any reason, not even knowing that you aided a terrorist, grab you, not ever telling when they grabbed you, you're a missing person, and then it's got a subsection on secret executions.
[00:28:35.633 --> 00:28:36.413]  Yeah.
[00:28:36.413 --> 00:28:40.036]  Yeah, this sounds like something out of a fiction, bad fiction novel, but
[00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:47.861]  You know, throughout history, totalitarian regimes have used terror as the instrument of state policy, and that's what we have today.
[00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:49.704]  It's just a continuation of history.
[00:28:49.704 --> 00:28:54.210]  I mean, the czars in Russia used it, the Nazis used it, the communists used it.
[00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:54.931]  It's nothing new.
[00:28:54.931 --> 00:28:56.133]  This is just a new guise.
[00:28:57.114 --> 00:28:59.075]  They're bringing about selective terror.
[00:28:59.075 --> 00:29:15.686]  I would suspect that they will try something again, maybe not quite as spectacular as 9-11, but certainly something of that nature to try and again galvanize what's called the GSR, galvanic skin response, to get the people scared to death, and so they'll give up more and more of their rights.
[00:29:15.686 --> 00:29:16.646]  But it's all an illusion.
[00:29:16.646 --> 00:29:21.970]  What we need to do is get rid of these criminals, bring them to justice, have them arrested under a real tribunal,
[00:29:22.652 --> 00:29:29.656]  And put them on trial for their crimes against not only the American people, but their crimes against humanity.
[00:29:29.656 --> 00:29:31.057]  Well, it's amazing.
[00:29:31.057 --> 00:29:33.338]  You know, the world is getting wise to this.
[00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:38.321]  The majority of people in Europe, and I've read the polls, are saying the globalists carry 9-1-1 out.
[00:29:41.733 --> 00:29:46.459]  Oh yeah.
[00:29:46.459 --> 00:29:56.549]  By refusing to give us documents that we've subpoenaed, documents that we've demanded by the regular court processes, by claiming that there is
[00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.011]  We're good to go.
[00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:23.477]  I mean, they can claim that to hide everything, to hide what they're doing.
[00:30:23.477 --> 00:30:25.018]  That's just a word, that means nothing.
[00:30:25.018 --> 00:30:26.139]  National security, what does that mean?
[00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:56.633]  Especially when we're accusing these very individuals of sabotaging national security of this country to pursue their own political agenda.
[00:30:56.633 --> 00:31:04.556]  Well, the new Patriot Act gets rid of almost all civil rights suits and court orders and gives them total immunity.
[00:31:04.556 --> 00:31:09.938]  Just like Bush's Homeland Security gave vaccine makers immunity for autism class action suits.
[00:31:09.938 --> 00:31:11.879]  So, I mean, you're right.
[00:31:11.879 --> 00:31:14.260]  It's criminals giving themselves immunity.
[00:31:15.095 --> 00:31:15.755]  Uh, that's right.
[00:31:15.755 --> 00:31:16.175]  That's right.
[00:31:16.175 --> 00:31:18.696]  Well, of course, you know, in Nazi Germany, you can't sue Hitler.
[00:31:18.696 --> 00:31:20.156]  Did anybody try to sue Hitler?
[00:31:20.156 --> 00:31:21.736]  No, he got immunity, too.
[00:31:21.736 --> 00:31:27.257]  And the same is true of communists, czars, Russia, Mao Zedong in China, what have you.
[00:31:27.257 --> 00:31:36.239]  Uh, you know, you cannot, you cannot, uh, enforce your rights unless you can bring these criminals to justice in a court of law, and they're trying to take away that right.
[00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:42.020]  Not only that way, but in many other ways, trying to attack, uh, so-called, uh, quote, trial lawyers, end quote.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:50.824]  Totally take away people's rights, con them into believing that you should just blindly follow Bush, make Bush a god.
[00:31:50.824 --> 00:31:53.024]  You know, it's really very frightening.
[00:31:53.024 --> 00:31:53.805]  What did you think?
[00:31:53.805 --> 00:31:55.285]  Because I have judicial watch on.
[00:31:55.285 --> 00:32:00.948]  Judicial watch is suing Bush for the workers there at the
[00:32:02.507 --> 00:32:02.988]  I don't
[00:32:23.524 --> 00:32:31.788]  Well, it's absurd, but it's like the situation in the Albany New York Mall where they arrest a guy for wearing a peace t-shirt.
[00:32:31.788 --> 00:32:35.250]  I mean, we're clearly losing civil liberties here.
[00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.891]  It's just really awful the way you do that.
[00:32:49.657 --> 00:32:54.419]  You undermine, like a termite, you know, you undermine and destroy the foundation of people's freedom.
[00:32:54.419 --> 00:33:13.626]  And you have people themselves going, I have a client here in San Francisco who was fired by Neiman Marcus a couple weeks ago because he was distributing some of your literature, Alex, like your videotapes and some of those, the deception dollars that have Bush's face as a, you know, as basically a war criminal and as a
[00:33:14.706 --> 00:33:22.849]  Uh, Big Brother, and these people arrested him, they put him in handcuffs, they beat him up, they, uh, they, uh, escorted him out of there and they fired him.
[00:33:22.849 --> 00:33:24.870]  And they said, uh, the country's at war.
[00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:33.493]  And, uh, by the way, he's a listener to this show, Abe Lash, during, when the security guy walked him in, he was doing this during his lunch break, which everybody was doing.
[00:33:34.253 --> 00:33:36.737]  Everybody was giving stuff out during lunch break.
[00:33:36.737 --> 00:33:39.061]  And he said to him, you're not allowed to do this.
[00:33:39.061 --> 00:33:40.543]  You're not allowed to sneak out.
[00:33:40.543 --> 00:33:41.224]  We're at war.
[00:33:41.224 --> 00:33:42.466]  You can't do that.
[00:33:42.466 --> 00:33:43.447]  And then fired him.
[00:33:43.447 --> 00:33:46.091]  So that is, it shows the mindset.
[00:33:46.091 --> 00:33:48.054]  The insane mindset.
[00:33:49.232 --> 00:33:49.932]  Yeah.
[00:33:49.932 --> 00:33:52.593]  Well, it's very much like the analogy with termites.
[00:33:52.593 --> 00:33:58.675]  I mean, the criminals, what they're doing is they're sending out the termites to undermine the foundation of the country.
[00:33:58.675 --> 00:34:03.896]  And just as with termites, you can think there's a brilliant house there that's ready to collapse because of the rot inside.
[00:34:03.896 --> 00:34:05.477]  But that's what's happening here.
[00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:12.519]  This country is rotting away and these termites are conning average citizens, security guards, mall guards.
[00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:15.760]  I'm really pleased to talk to you, Mr. Hilton.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.320]  Thank you.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.380]  And I wanted to ask you, do you think that on September 11th,
[00:34:43.123 --> 00:34:46.704]  Were there hijackers on those planes or not?
[00:34:46.704 --> 00:34:51.466]  Um, you know, that's, it's hard to say since we've never seen, from a legal point of view, the bodies.
[00:34:51.466 --> 00:34:53.387]  There's never been autopsies and so forth.
[00:34:53.387 --> 00:34:54.727]  We've never identified bodies.
[00:34:54.727 --> 00:34:58.309]  But there were, there was a passport found in the rubble, uncharged.
[00:34:58.309 --> 00:34:59.769]  It turns out 8 of the 19 are still alive.
[00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.191]  It's clear they're patsies, as he said.
[00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:06.073]  You've seen on camera, we know that.
[00:35:06.073 --> 00:35:08.494]  What he's focusing on is, who paid their rent?
[00:35:08.494 --> 00:35:09.735]  The FBI.
[00:35:09.735 --> 00:35:10.496]  Who protected them?
[00:35:10.496 --> 00:35:12.377]  Who told FBI agents not to stop them?
[00:35:12.377 --> 00:35:15.519]  The FBI, CIA, W1999, Bush.
[00:35:15.519 --> 00:35:17.200]  Is that what you're saying, Mr. Hilton?
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.921]  You can prove they work for the U.S.
[00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:19.762]  government.
[00:35:19.762 --> 00:35:22.464]  Oh yes, but they were on the government's payroll, there's no question.
[00:35:22.464 --> 00:35:23.985]  As I said earlier, double agents.
[00:35:25.065 --> 00:35:25.986]  I don't think so.
[00:35:42.449 --> 00:35:46.530]  We have some evidence to believe that he's still alive, that he's contacted her.
[00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.251]  And so, how could he be dead in a crash when he's contacting her now?
[00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:52.532]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff we're dealing with now.
[00:35:52.532 --> 00:35:55.493]  These are individuals that were groomed by the U.S.
[00:35:55.493 --> 00:35:56.994]  government, and they were protected.
[00:35:56.994 --> 00:36:02.715]  And you said you have depositions, and this is what I already had, too, that they were involved in Oklahoma City and World Trade Center One.
[00:36:02.715 --> 00:36:06.877]  Yeah, that they took trips out there shortly before the April 1995 bombings.
[00:36:08.417 --> 00:36:09.758]  Et cetera, et cetera.
[00:36:09.758 --> 00:36:19.102]  And that, you know, even the date there, Hitler's birthday being April 20th, you know, that was all, of course, hinting at anti-Semitism because Hitler is the anti-Semite.
[00:36:19.102 --> 00:36:23.203]  So trying to blame it on the right wing using Islamic proxies.
[00:36:23.203 --> 00:36:29.686]  Now we see the story being circulated that the right, the real right wing that fights the New World Order is connected to Saddam.
[00:36:29.686 --> 00:36:34.268]  And why would Clinton, after these guys were arrested by good FBI, order their release?
[00:36:34.608 --> 00:36:39.190]  And why wouldn't the Feds release the surveillance camera footage of them bombing the building, correct Stanley?
[00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.171]  Oh yes, yes.
[00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:50.136]  So showing government operatives being protected to later be linked up with the American people to stick Homeland Security on, let's face it, white people.
[00:36:50.136 --> 00:36:53.077]  Get you trained to accept it, to get the Arabs, then it's for everybody.
[00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:53.757]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:01.522 --> 00:37:02.742]  All right.
[00:37:02.742 --> 00:37:03.643]  I gotta stop.
[00:37:03.643 --> 00:37:05.923]  Stanley Hilton is free to stay with us for another 20 minutes.
[00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:07.904]  We'll have time to control all your calls.
[00:37:07.904 --> 00:37:16.686]  Jackie in Oklahoma, you're on the air with the attorney suing George Bush for complicit action in 9-1-1, which is totally documented.
[00:37:16.686 --> 00:37:20.307]  A 10-year-old can figure that out if we can just get the people to face the facts.
[00:37:20.307 --> 00:37:21.387]  Jackie, go ahead.
[00:37:21.387 --> 00:37:22.608]  Hi, Alex.
[00:37:22.608 --> 00:37:23.248]  We love you.
[00:37:24.401 --> 00:37:27.443]  I called in before I even realized that you had a guest speaker.
[00:37:27.443 --> 00:37:28.244]  I'll not even hold him.
[00:37:28.244 --> 00:37:29.845]  Do you have any comments or questions for our guest?
[00:37:29.845 --> 00:37:34.288]  Well, I've got both of you, Mr. Hilton, for your efforts.
[00:37:34.288 --> 00:37:49.239]  My concern is that with the powers that be, having as much power and control as they do, if we're going to be able to actually get in a control crisis that is predicted that may happen.
[00:37:49.239 --> 00:37:51.080]  And my question for you, Alex, is
[00:37:52.307 --> 00:37:57.750]  That there's a deterrent of what's going on, really, and that could be this planet headed this way.
[00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.731]  Well, let me try to boil down what you're saying.
[00:37:59.731 --> 00:38:03.232]  The globalists, as Stanley said earlier, are going to blow more stuff up.
[00:38:03.232 --> 00:38:04.453]  They've genomized their war.
[00:38:04.453 --> 00:38:05.714]  We criticize it.
[00:38:05.714 --> 00:38:06.674]  Point out how it's wrong.
[00:38:06.674 --> 00:38:08.855]  They go, we've got to do this to protect you.
[00:38:08.855 --> 00:38:11.236]  My job is to protect the American people, Bush said over and over again.
[00:38:11.236 --> 00:38:12.797]  They blow more stuff up.
[00:38:12.797 --> 00:38:15.038]  He poses as our savior.
[00:38:15.038 --> 00:38:16.299]  National talk show host.
[00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:22.762]  Uh, out there, Michael Savage has said, anyone that criticizes the government should be put in a forced labor camp.
[00:38:22.762 --> 00:38:29.685]  He's now on national TV, MSNBC, they're on the Nazi channel, same place where Abrams says, you know, torture kids.
[00:38:29.685 --> 00:38:32.447]  He's on there saying, put us in forced labor camps.
[00:38:32.447 --> 00:38:34.408]  So they're setting up this paradigm.
[00:38:34.408 --> 00:38:40.791]  That's why it's so important to expose them, the globalists, for being involved in 9-1-1, that that neutralizes them.
[00:38:40.791 --> 00:38:41.992]  Mr. Hilton, any comments?
[00:38:43.149 --> 00:38:50.634]  Well, yeah, I mean, I think that there's no question that what she mentions, you know, is how about they have so much power and all this.
[00:38:50.634 --> 00:38:54.977]  Well, all these tyrannical governments put on the shield of power.
[00:38:54.977 --> 00:38:56.979]  They always fall because of their own nature.
[00:38:56.979 --> 00:38:58.360]  Yeah, I mean, you know.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.161]  Look at Russia.
[00:39:00.161 --> 00:39:04.403]  They had the communist tyranny, but it fell eventually.
[00:39:04.403 --> 00:39:06.404]  I mean, you know, because people were sick of it.
[00:39:06.404 --> 00:39:11.467]  If it's rotten from the inside, like a termite analogy again, the structure will collapse.
[00:39:11.467 --> 00:39:12.387]  It could be a mansion.
[00:39:12.387 --> 00:39:13.788]  It could be a fortress.
[00:39:13.788 --> 00:39:22.813]  But if you chip away at it enough and the underlying population realizes what this fraudulent deception is, eventually it'll collapse from within.
[00:39:22.813 --> 00:39:23.994]  It'll implode.
[00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:25.975]  As Lincoln would say, it's an implosion.
[00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.071]  But could all this be a deterrent?
[00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:34.951]  The possibility, and I know Alex doesn't want to talk about it, of this planet headed this way.
[00:39:34.951 --> 00:39:38.512]  Oh, that's total, total diversion, total government hype.
[00:39:38.512 --> 00:39:40.192]  Of the what?
[00:39:40.192 --> 00:39:41.192]  Just don't worry about it.
[00:39:41.192 --> 00:39:42.813]  I appreciate the call, Jackie.
[00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:43.113]  Okay.
[00:39:43.113 --> 00:39:53.895]  My goodness, it's just, the government controls the fake conspiracy shows, and they talk about kooky stuff, and then everybody picks it up and goes with all that, and then nothing, and then it diverts everybody.
[00:39:53.895 --> 00:39:55.175]  Let me tell you what the big
[00:39:55.715 --> 00:39:57.356]  Thing the globalists are worried about.
[00:39:57.356 --> 00:40:05.581]  The people getting advanced technology, the people getting life extension, sovereign nations having their own sovereignty, and the global empire losing control.
[00:40:05.581 --> 00:40:07.723]  That's why they're racing to do this.
[00:40:07.723 --> 00:40:08.683]  Let's go to Gordon.
[00:40:08.683 --> 00:40:11.205]  Gordon, where are you calling from tonight?
[00:40:11.205 --> 00:40:12.706]  I'm calling from Toronto.
[00:40:12.706 --> 00:40:14.567]  Welcome from Canada, go ahead.
[00:40:14.567 --> 00:40:17.749]  Hi, I really appreciate your show, and hi Mr. Hilton.
[00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:18.969]  Hello.
[00:40:18.969 --> 00:40:22.792]  First time I heard about you was at the Washington protest in October.
[00:40:22.792 --> 00:40:24.553]  I went there to attend and I was given a
[00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:29.802]  A pamphlet where I discovered that you were representing family members.
[00:40:29.802 --> 00:40:31.723]  And so I really appreciate your work and your family.
[00:40:31.723 --> 00:40:35.825]  Almost total news blackout and he represents more families than anybody else.
[00:40:35.825 --> 00:40:37.226]  Right.
[00:40:37.226 --> 00:40:39.887]  Actually, Alex, for you, I have something interesting.
[00:40:39.887 --> 00:40:44.530]  A couple of weeks ago, I don't know the man, but I came across him.
[00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.611]  His name is Rocco Galati.
[00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:51.614]  He was the lawyer for Belmar Freeland and it was in a
[00:40:52.364 --> 00:41:02.687]  A conference at the University of Toronto and he mentioned his name so I waited after the conference to speak to him and I approached him and asked if he indeed was Rocco Gallati.
[00:41:02.687 --> 00:41:04.108]  He said yes.
[00:41:04.108 --> 00:41:13.310]  And I asked him what had happened to Delmar Freeland and he drew closer and whispered that he's dead.
[00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:19.492]  I speculated that he was killed in August and he said that he had been killed September the 4th of 2002.
[00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:22.726]  Yes, indeed.
[00:41:22.726 --> 00:41:23.506]  Not yet.
[00:41:23.506 --> 00:41:24.207]  Not that I've seen.
[00:41:24.207 --> 00:41:24.267]  No.
[00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:42.955]  Well, he was this guy who did pass the jail guard, said he was Naval Intelligence.
[00:41:42.955 --> 00:41:44.296]  He was in jail, fleeing the U.S.
[00:41:44.296 --> 00:41:45.397]  government up in Canada.
[00:41:45.397 --> 00:41:45.997]  Oh, wait a minute!
[00:41:45.997 --> 00:41:46.778]  I think I know now.
[00:41:46.778 --> 00:41:47.679]  I do know who it is.
[00:41:47.679 --> 00:41:47.919]  Yes, I do.
[00:41:47.919 --> 00:41:51.742]  And he gave him the letter saying, you know, the World Trade Center is going to get knocked down.
[00:41:51.742 --> 00:41:52.923]  That was confirmed.
[00:41:52.923 --> 00:41:53.744]  Yes.
[00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:55.966]  And then this caller from Toronto saying he's dead.
[00:41:55.966 --> 00:41:57.327]  I don't know if that's the case.
[00:41:57.327 --> 00:41:58.128]  I'll have to find out.
[00:41:58.128 --> 00:42:00.630]  I know who it is, but I don't know whether he's alive or not.
[00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:01.250]  I don't know.
[00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.073]  Well, I mean, I think Golotti's a good man.
[00:42:04.073 --> 00:42:05.034]  I don't think he's lying.
[00:42:05.034 --> 00:42:05.294]  He may
[00:42:07.583 --> 00:42:09.224]  That's what he may believe right now.
[00:42:09.224 --> 00:42:10.145]  Why would he whisper that?
[00:42:10.145 --> 00:42:12.787]  We'll try to find out what happened.
[00:42:12.787 --> 00:42:13.648]  I'll make some calls, okay?
[00:42:13.648 --> 00:42:15.209]  I don't like to speculate.
[00:42:15.209 --> 00:42:16.790]  I like to stick to what we can prove.
[00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:17.470]  Absolutely.
[00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:23.255]  I just want to mention that the next day was when he was due for court for his trial.
[00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:27.651]  This is a call, was it ONI, Office of Naval Intelligence?
[00:42:27.651 --> 00:42:28.471]  Yes.
[00:42:28.471 --> 00:42:29.531]  Yeah, ONI, right.
[00:42:29.531 --> 00:42:31.591]  And the next day was due in court.
[00:42:31.591 --> 00:42:32.552]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[00:42:32.552 --> 00:42:33.552]  We don't know if that's true.
[00:42:33.552 --> 00:42:35.152]  I have to check this stuff out.
[00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:40.533]  There's so much, there's an endless sea of real news.
[00:42:40.533 --> 00:42:42.274]  Why speculate?
[00:42:42.274 --> 00:42:45.734]  We'll be right back with more calls for our guests.
[00:42:45.734 --> 00:42:47.315]  This is GPM.
[00:42:47.315 --> 00:42:49.075]  What do you do without freedom?
[00:43:04.196 --> 00:43:06.257]  Fight, and you may die.
[00:43:06.257 --> 00:43:08.759]  Run, and you'll live.
[00:43:08.759 --> 00:43:10.079]  At least a while.
[00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:32.252]  And dying in your bed, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
[00:43:35.824 --> 00:43:40.989]  Alright, it's our final segment with Stanley Hilton.
[00:43:40.989 --> 00:43:48.278]  I've been so honored to have him on the show with incredible revelations tonight.
[00:43:52.737 --> 00:43:53.658]  Amazing courage.
[00:43:53.658 --> 00:43:55.879]  If more of us had it, we could save this country.
[00:43:55.879 --> 00:44:02.502]  It is a human cycle of tyranny, and this one is waxing probably worse than ever seen in world history.
[00:44:02.502 --> 00:44:04.343]  We must defeat it.
[00:44:04.343 --> 00:44:07.905]  Let's talk to Dan in New York.
[00:44:07.905 --> 00:44:09.366]  You're on the air with Stanley Hilton.
[00:44:09.366 --> 00:44:09.826]  Go ahead, Dan.
[00:44:09.826 --> 00:44:11.907]  Hi, it's an honor to talk to you both.
[00:44:11.907 --> 00:44:16.249]  I'm from Lowetown, New York, the hometown of your good friend, Bill O'Reilly, actually.
[00:44:16.249 --> 00:44:21.192]  And I watched the road to tyranny, and I've been visiting him for wars quite often lately, and ever since 9-11,
[00:44:22.962 --> 00:44:27.363]  I've been a patriot, and I love this country so much, and I see what Bush has been doing.
[00:44:27.363 --> 00:44:28.303]  It's been making me sick.
[00:44:28.303 --> 00:44:33.884]  I mean, I'm 18 years old, and I know kids in my school that just don't care about this kind of stuff, and it doesn't faze them.
[00:44:33.884 --> 00:44:35.524]  They don't see the big danger.
[00:44:35.524 --> 00:44:42.346]  They're going to care when they get drafted to serve in Homeland Army in the 63 countries, 62 countries they want to hit.
[00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.366]  Mr. Hilton?
[00:44:43.366 --> 00:44:49.707]  Yes, they'll care if they get an M-16 and a khaki pants and a uniform to go out
[00:44:50.627 --> 00:44:59.152]  You know, and fight for senseless wars in Iraq, Israel, or whatever, for something that has nothing to do with American security.
[00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:00.771]  No, I totally agree with you.
[00:45:00.771 --> 00:45:04.613]  And what I want to call about is the National History Day was this past Sunday.
[00:45:04.613 --> 00:45:06.314]  I wrote a paper that was kind of anti-war.
[00:45:06.314 --> 00:45:11.177]  I basically said that the Gulf War was about oil, and then this is the whole entire motive behind the war.
[00:45:11.177 --> 00:45:12.678]  And the judge kind of shut me out.
[00:45:12.678 --> 00:45:13.839]  I mean, they were nice.
[00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:14.640]  They weren't mean people.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.882]  I'm not going to hold it against them, but they were pretty biased.
[00:45:17.882 --> 00:45:22.825]  Oh yeah, in some public schools in the East, there's been several articles, they say
[00:45:23.525 --> 00:45:28.231]  Well, you know, there was, I tell you, as far as the war is concerned, there was a congressman
[00:45:40.053 --> 00:45:53.967]  Up there near Northern Virginia that was attacked by the media, the mainstream media just a few days ago because he said this war is about Israel and he was of course immediately accused of being anti-Semitic, etc, etc, blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:53.967 --> 00:46:03.517]  And so, you know, not only are you accused of being a terrorist and of being anti-government, but you're accused of being an anti-Semite if you just exercise your freedom of speech about what's going on.
[00:46:04.424 --> 00:46:24.123]  Again, Stanley Hilton, former chief counsel for Bob Dole, and I think he pointed out, well, you oppose the tyranny of communist Russia, the tyranny of Adolf Hitler, the tyranny of Bush, the tyranny of Israel, the tyranny of Iraq, any of these countries, but you're right, you're not even supposed to discriticize, and I'm angry at Israel saying they're going to assassinate American citizens.
[00:46:24.783 --> 00:46:26.846]  Without a trial here in America?
[00:46:26.846 --> 00:46:29.969]  I mean, we'd be mad if the Chinese said they'd do that.
[00:46:29.969 --> 00:46:35.736]  We'd be mad if the Mexican troops, which are doing that, by the way, they've got bounties on Border Patrol's heads.
[00:46:35.736 --> 00:46:37.858]  But Israel can do it, and it is wrong.
[00:46:37.858 --> 00:46:41.902]  And that is happening, and I agree we should speak out against it.
[00:46:41.902 --> 00:46:45.767]  And I think the left wing should get more focused on making the UN the big authority.
[00:46:46.347 --> 00:46:55.052]  Because it's all controlled as well, but pointing out this whole, as you said, this shadow world government, this world fascist state, is using these organs.
[00:46:55.052 --> 00:46:56.152]  Anything else, Dan?
[00:46:56.152 --> 00:47:01.335]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that, I mean, I feel really bad that I'm kind of like, my generation is just, they just don't care about it.
[00:47:01.335 --> 00:47:03.056]  Apathetic, yeah, apathetic.
[00:47:03.056 --> 00:47:04.117]  It really is pathetic.
[00:47:04.117 --> 00:47:06.958]  Well, look, it was 5% that won the Revolutionary War in 1776.
[00:47:06.958 --> 00:47:08.239]  It was 2% that started it, sir.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:13.883]  So, believe me, our numbers, Stanley, wouldn't you say our numbers are probably 10-15%?
[00:47:13.883 --> 00:47:33.417]  Yeah, minorities have always wielded the cutting edge of history, you know, it's always been a minority, even if you look at the Bolsheviks, not to start out with seven people, there were revolutionary people, there were very few who were adamantly against the British tyranny, that's true, minorities have always wielded the cutting edge of history.
[00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:34.638]  Yeah, so you don't want
[00:47:35.259 --> 00:47:46.625]  I mean, I don't mean to be mean, but somebody watching American Idol drooling, drinking whiskey, or snorting cocaine, those poor, sad people, we're trying to protect their rights and they'll never thank us.
[00:47:46.625 --> 00:47:49.767]  But it doesn't matter, we're protecting our family and our children.
[00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:50.747]  Thanks for the call, Dan.
[00:47:50.747 --> 00:47:51.487]  No problem.
[00:47:51.487 --> 00:47:53.749]  Yeah, I mean, people start talking about torturing kids.
[00:47:53.749 --> 00:47:54.649]  I come out against them.
[00:47:54.649 --> 00:47:55.950]  It's that simple.
[00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.151]  Well, it's being done in the Middle East every day now.
[00:47:58.151 --> 00:48:01.973]  You know, the Palestinians are being tortured and murdered every day, so it's nothing new.
[00:48:03.343 --> 00:48:08.865]  Well, I've seen the video of him shooting five-year-old kids, and it's wrong, and then you find out Israel founded Hamas.
[00:48:08.865 --> 00:48:09.786]  That's you, Doc Rabin.
[00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:11.066]  That's not me.
[00:48:11.066 --> 00:48:13.247]  Uh, the Xi'An Press International.
[00:48:13.247 --> 00:48:15.168]  Uh, let's talk to Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[00:48:15.168 --> 00:48:16.028]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[00:48:16.028 --> 00:48:16.528]  Go ahead.
[00:48:16.528 --> 00:48:23.631]  Good evening, Alex, and, uh, I'd like to say hi to your guests, and I'd also like to say to the gentleman that called right before me that I am part of your generation.
[00:48:23.631 --> 00:48:26.312]  I'm 23 years old, and I see it.
[00:48:26.312 --> 00:48:30.794]  Uh, Alex, and, um, I haven't been able to get your video yet, The Road to Tyranny, but guess what?
[00:48:30.794 --> 00:48:31.614]  I found a way
[00:48:32.458 --> 00:48:48.864]  To hook my shortwave radio into my stereo so I can just snap off the back of it and hook speaker wire to the two terminals of the speaker and then hook it into the in jacks of the tape deck and it tapes it in stereo even though the radio only brocket comes out mono
[00:48:49.577 --> 00:48:51.799]  So I can start giving out your programs.
[00:48:51.799 --> 00:48:53.260]  That is a great thing to do.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.442]  You also want to call a local station and get them to... I'm going to send it.
[00:48:56.442 --> 00:48:57.322]  I'm going to do better.
[00:48:57.322 --> 00:49:05.968]  I'm going to send the tapes, send tapes of it to the local radio stations of your programs, you know, and figure out which ones that I tape are the best, most compelling.
[00:49:05.968 --> 00:49:16.735]  Also, I'd like to say that I saw a little advertisement on the Weather Channel for Homeland Security, 1-800-BE-READY, and I called that up, and I played them, and I played
[00:49:19.164 --> 00:49:27.364]  The number that you call for the makers of the Mark of the Beast, Applied Digital, I played them your commercial.
[00:49:28.554 --> 00:49:33.978]  Well, I just want to say something about the so-called Homeland... I call it Homeland Insecurity, because that's their real purpose.
[00:49:33.978 --> 00:49:36.040]  Well, I call it the Department of the New World Order.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.281]  Yeah, I mean, it's a Nazi term.
[00:49:38.281 --> 00:49:38.982]  Yeah.
[00:49:38.982 --> 00:49:42.564]  Homeland Insecurity, the purpose is to make Americans insecure, not secure.
[00:49:42.564 --> 00:49:43.325]  Yeah.
[00:49:43.325 --> 00:49:44.866]  Let me just tell you this briefly.
[00:49:44.866 --> 00:49:54.793]  The lady that was married to one of the hijackers, she has been interviewed by the FBI 30 times and has told them various things, which they have then used to
[00:49:55.413 --> 00:49:57.514]  For this orange alert, red alert.
[00:49:57.514 --> 00:50:02.496]  She's actually shown me how they've used some things that are totally made up.
[00:50:02.496 --> 00:50:05.698]  This is a complete fraud.
[00:50:05.698 --> 00:50:07.038]  Nothing happened when they put out the alert.
[00:50:07.038 --> 00:50:08.659]  I think that was because they knew people were like...
[00:50:09.571 --> 00:50:11.092]  Kind of, like, they went on edge.
[00:50:11.092 --> 00:50:12.713]  That's how they blow stuff up.
[00:50:12.713 --> 00:50:14.915]  They go, see, we warned you.
[00:50:14.915 --> 00:50:17.777]  Now when there's an orange alert, we're going to lock the cities down.
[00:50:17.777 --> 00:50:22.000]  Washington Post reported... Oh, I heard about it on the radio station in my area.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.101]  Oh, let me tell you this.
[00:50:23.101 --> 00:50:27.965]  Under a red alert, your children will be taken at school to a FEMA center.
[00:50:27.965 --> 00:50:28.925]  You won't be allowed to get them.
[00:50:28.925 --> 00:50:29.245]  Go ahead.
[00:50:29.245 --> 00:50:29.606]  Close.
[00:50:29.606 --> 00:50:31.307]  That's what they were saying.
[00:50:31.307 --> 00:50:32.388]  There's a school around here.
[00:50:32.908 --> 00:50:35.372]  They're going, uh, they're- Oh, terrorism!
[00:50:35.372 --> 00:50:37.034]  Well, we gotta keep food and supplies!
[00:50:37.034 --> 00:50:40.539]  They weren't allowed- Now they- And they're saying they don't want you- They might not let you get your kids.
[00:50:41.330 --> 00:51:02.164]  Well, let me just tell you, one of the people we've interviewed for the case is a former top official at FEMA, who was there during the Reagan administration and the first Bush administration, and again, FEMA being one of the agencies that would swing into action in the event of a, quote, emergency, has blueprints for establishing martial law in this country.
[00:51:02.164 --> 00:51:03.265]  Sir, Mr. Hilton, hold on.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:20.467]  We posted mainstream news articles last week where they admit giant one million man concentration camps with, this is Rocky Mountain News, with incinerators and mass graves already ready.
[00:51:20.467 --> 00:51:22.148]  Man, taking Hitler, huh?
[00:51:22.148 --> 00:51:25.309]  Let me tell you, Mr. Hilton, I'm not joking, I can see the article.
[00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:26.810]  I believe it, I believe it, yeah.
[00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:31.932]  You're pushing the Antichrist, so you think it's my trail or what?
[00:51:31.932 --> 00:51:35.374]  No sir, I don't get into all those weird groups.
[00:51:35.374 --> 00:51:37.155]  I go coast to coast.
[00:51:37.155 --> 00:51:39.096]  I emailed them to get you on.
[00:51:39.096 --> 00:51:40.556]  Well I appreciate it.
[00:51:40.556 --> 00:51:43.298]  I'm doing all I can to fight the New World Order, I am.
[00:51:43.298 --> 00:51:44.498]  Alright bro, thanks for the call.
[00:51:44.498 --> 00:51:53.702]  You know, the poor folks in Rwanda when the UN was killing them thought that it was the Antichrist and they were about to get raptured out.
[00:51:53.702 --> 00:51:54.563]  It didn't happen.
[00:51:55.263 --> 00:51:56.905]  Same thing with Hitler, folks.
[00:51:56.905 --> 00:51:59.207]  God helps those that help themselves.
[00:51:59.207 --> 00:52:00.208]  I believe in God.
[00:52:00.208 --> 00:52:01.109]  I'm a Christian.
[00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:06.515]  But I believe we've got these phony churches that have been infiltrated by the government and are telling you to lay down.
[00:52:06.515 --> 00:52:08.577]  And we've got to say no to that.
[00:52:08.577 --> 00:52:12.201]  Well, the other thing I want to say about the rapture and eschatology and so on is that
[00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:27.032]  A lot of these right-wing churches support Israel because they feel that the Bible gives them the right to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates and beyond, you know, and it's just another propaganda ploy to support our going out there and dying for Israel because the Bible says so.
[00:52:28.894 --> 00:52:32.999]  I mean, this idea that Jesus will come with a rapture tomorrow if we support Israel today.
[00:52:32.999 --> 00:52:35.001]  We've got Armageddon around the corner.
[00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:36.183]  I mean, this is nonsense.
[00:52:36.183 --> 00:52:37.825]  This is just a complete sham.
[00:52:37.825 --> 00:52:42.691]  But why do all the right-wing evangelical Christians support this state which has anti-Christians?
[00:52:42.691 --> 00:52:44.314]  But hold on, they're not right-wing, Pat.
[00:52:44.314 --> 00:52:46.176]  They're neocons.
[00:52:46.176 --> 00:52:46.717]  Well, not only...
[00:52:47.157 --> 00:52:48.778]  Yeah, cons as in con artists.
[00:52:48.778 --> 00:52:54.462]  But I mean, the point is that why are you supporting a country that's anti-Christian?
[00:52:54.462 --> 00:53:05.149]  I mean, it's not only anti-Christian, but that it's attempted to shut down Christmas, take away Christmas trees, et cetera, et cetera, you know, national holiday, take away the crosses in cities.
[00:53:05.149 --> 00:53:07.611]  I mean, this is what we're fighting for.
[00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:08.571]  Absolutely.
[00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:11.933]  And that's why Yusof Rabin was killed.
[00:53:11.933 --> 00:53:12.934]  You wouldn't go along with it.
[00:53:12.934 --> 00:53:14.055]  And I would add to that,
[00:53:15.996 --> 00:53:18.057]  It's this global body.
[00:53:18.057 --> 00:53:22.761]  It's the large central banks, and they're made up of the Bushes, the Dutch, the British.
[00:53:22.761 --> 00:53:23.541]  It's all connected.
[00:53:23.541 --> 00:53:25.463]  Let's take some more calls.
[00:53:25.463 --> 00:53:30.066]  Up next is only two more calls, and we've got to let our guests go.
[00:53:30.066 --> 00:53:31.867]  Rich in Maryland, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:53:31.867 --> 00:53:34.629]  Hey, you guys are right on target tonight.
[00:53:34.629 --> 00:53:40.474]  And Stanley, you're right about the term dual loyalists is a little generous.
[00:53:40.474 --> 00:53:42.275]  They are Israeli first
[00:53:42.731 --> 00:53:44.452]  Well, let me just say this.
[00:53:44.452 --> 00:53:47.134]  I don't come up with this comment out of nowhere
[00:54:09.878 --> 00:54:34.060]  I look at the FBI training manuals, I have them on tape, I have them on video, and when I say white people, I want racist white America that goes, oh yeah, Bush killed them Arabs, killed them, you know, it's acceptable to have radio promos where it goes, look at them camels run, look at them ragheads, that's on national radio, that type of racism is acceptable, and I think it's disgusting
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:46.145]  And then they'll come back, well I want white America to know that what FEMA's creating, what they're trying to police is Christians, gun owners, homeschoolers, those that believe in the second coming of Christ.
[00:54:47.154 --> 00:54:51.435]  This is, I have in my film, their documents, their news articles, them on video.
[00:54:51.435 --> 00:55:01.199]  I want people to know that this Homeland Security deal, that they want to merge and blame the right-wing, the real right-wing, not the neocons, with Oklahoma City, connecting it to Iraqis.
[00:55:01.199 --> 00:55:12.942]  You just heard Stanley Hilton interview government officials, has the depositions, knows that these Muslims that were hired were there at World Trade Center 1, 2, and Oklahoma City.
[00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.163]  That's the frame-up!
[00:55:15.183 --> 00:55:16.384]  That's what they're doing.
[00:55:16.384 --> 00:55:17.626]  Go ahead, Rich.
[00:55:17.626 --> 00:55:28.717]  Yeah, and I think in the end, you know, well, what we're looking at here, this thing is going to be, you know, they've got up to, what, 500,000 foreign troops they're planning to put here?
[00:55:28.717 --> 00:55:30.979]  Oh, let me tell you a little bit about that.
[00:55:30.979 --> 00:55:35.704]  He's a very intelligent man, and he's written books on this subject, and again, Bob Dole's chief counsel.
[00:55:36.707 --> 00:55:37.268]  I have.
[00:55:37.268 --> 00:55:39.891]  AP, Reuters, CBC, Washington Post.
[00:55:39.891 --> 00:55:42.234]  This sounds so crazy, it's not my opinion.
[00:55:42.234 --> 00:55:45.178]  It's just like the incinerators, I can't believe them, are torturing kids.
[00:55:45.178 --> 00:55:46.920]  I mean, they're saying all this.
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.464]  It is in my film, Road to Tyranny, Master Terror, both of them.
[00:55:50.214 --> 00:55:59.403]  Where they say they've signed deals to bring Dutch, Czech Republic, Mexican, Canadian, British, and yes, Israeli.
[00:55:59.403 --> 00:56:03.387]  All these people here, and I've been a training officer, they train to put us in camps.
[00:56:03.387 --> 00:56:07.271]  They've signed the deals to bring them in to quote, deal with American terrorists.
[00:56:07.271 --> 00:56:08.693]  Mr. Hilton, have you heard about that?
[00:56:09.473 --> 00:56:10.354]  Ah, yes I have.
[00:56:10.354 --> 00:56:15.860]  I mean, I think that I've heard from the person that I mentioned before that was in FEMA.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.342]  There's definitely an agenda here.
[00:56:17.342 --> 00:56:24.289]  I mean, this is something that's truly, I think, of a world historical significance with what's down the line here.
[00:56:24.289 --> 00:56:25.650]  I mean, this is not a minor thing.
[00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:28.653]  This is not about finding who caused 7-Eleven.
[00:56:28.653 --> 00:56:29.434]  We know who did.
[00:56:29.434 --> 00:56:31.136]  He's sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania.
[00:56:32.497 --> 00:56:33.919]  That's where he is.
[00:56:33.919 --> 00:56:36.443]  We know who did it.
[00:56:36.443 --> 00:56:40.448]  This is all about this larger entity and what they're trying to do.
[00:56:40.448 --> 00:56:46.696]  If you look at it from a historical perspective, there have been others in history who have similar goals.
[00:56:46.696 --> 00:56:48.498]  These ones, though, have high technology.
[00:56:49.099 --> 00:56:54.801]  They're pulling the wool over Americans' eyes with the mediacs, the mass mediacs, as I call them.
[00:56:54.801 --> 00:56:59.603]  And their napskin gown has been their economic warfare tool to get everybody economically dependent.
[00:56:59.603 --> 00:57:02.524]  Oh yeah, I think the attempt at Bush depression is intentional.
[00:57:02.524 --> 00:57:03.344]  It's not negligent.
[00:57:03.344 --> 00:57:05.605]  As incompetent as Bush is, I don't think it's
[00:57:05.905 --> 00:57:06.646]  It's negligence.
[00:57:06.646 --> 00:57:13.391]  I think it's intentional to wreck this country's economy in order to make the people more dependent, more scared, more insecure.
[00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:16.774]  And the Department of Homeland Insecurity will extend economic insecurity.
[00:57:16.774 --> 00:57:19.897]  And they're going to have national service in the new bill.
[00:57:19.897 --> 00:57:25.721]  There's a new bill for compulsory national service, and you'll all get jobs from the government.
[00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:26.842]  They've even said it.
[00:57:26.842 --> 00:57:31.266]  I watched the Homeland Security meeting with Ridge on C-SPAN, and he said it.
[00:57:31.266 --> 00:57:33.748]  He said they're going to have troops in the factories.
[00:57:34.268 --> 00:57:38.331]  Now, Alex, what they're going to do is they're going to do the man behind the screen thing.
[00:57:38.331 --> 00:57:39.292]  You know what I mean?
[00:57:39.292 --> 00:57:40.573]  The Wizard of Oz thing?
[00:57:40.573 --> 00:57:44.736]  They're going to have, let's say, half a million, 500,000 foreign troops.
[00:57:44.736 --> 00:57:45.517]  Okay?
[00:57:45.517 --> 00:57:47.558]  You've got 285 million people.
[00:57:47.558 --> 00:57:48.479]  Most of them are armed.
[00:57:48.479 --> 00:57:52.942]  The problem is we're all balkanized fighting with each other, but it's true.
[00:57:52.942 --> 00:57:55.304]  A motivated minority of us can defeat this.
[00:57:55.304 --> 00:57:55.905]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:56.525 --> 00:57:58.487]  But it takes telling the truth and getting involved.
[00:57:58.487 --> 00:58:01.990]  One last call for our guest, Stanley Hilton, who I really want to thank for coming on the show.
[00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:04.793]  Rhonda in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:58:04.793 --> 00:58:06.595]  Evening, gentlemen.
[00:58:07.168 --> 00:58:09.469]  Thank you guys for all your work.
[00:58:09.469 --> 00:58:12.872]  That was Congressman Moran that made that statement.
[00:58:12.872 --> 00:58:14.372]  He since apologized for it.
[00:58:14.372 --> 00:58:15.393]  Of course.
[00:58:15.393 --> 00:58:18.295]  Under pressure from Bush.
[00:58:18.295 --> 00:58:19.135]  Yeah.
[00:58:19.135 --> 00:58:26.000]  Whose father was arrested for funding the Nazis running almost all their operations again.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:26.560]  Yeah.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:34.988]  You know, this rapture cult kind of fits in good with the fatherland security, because when people start disappearing, they can blame it on the rapture.
[00:58:34.988 --> 00:58:35.728]  We can't find them.
[00:58:35.728 --> 00:58:36.609]  I don't know where they are.
[00:58:36.609 --> 00:58:38.271]  God must have took them.
[00:58:38.271 --> 00:58:43.355]  Well, you know, in South America, it's called Desaparecidos, which means it disappeared.
[00:58:43.355 --> 00:58:46.178]  You have this in Chile and Argentina, et cetera.
[00:58:46.178 --> 00:58:49.401]  Whole hundreds of thousands of people disappear and their families go,
[00:58:49.921 --> 00:58:53.183]  Go marching around the Central Square on Saturday afternoons.
[00:58:53.183 --> 00:58:54.985]  I mean, that's what you're going to be seeing here pretty soon.
[00:58:54.985 --> 00:58:57.486]  People have disappeared, and they're going to wonder, where did they go?
[00:58:57.486 --> 00:59:04.891]  And, you know, that's the goal here, to spread terror, to make you feel that unless you toe the line, you're going to be picked up next.
[00:59:04.891 --> 00:59:06.652]  That's the ultimate form of power.
[00:59:06.652 --> 00:59:08.173]  And if you give in to that, they win.
[00:59:08.173 --> 00:59:12.276]  We've got to stand up like Paul Revere and say, uh-uh, baby!
[00:59:12.276 --> 00:59:13.857]  Not here!
[00:59:13.857 --> 00:59:19.441]  What I want to ask you is, in the Poznan military, how is our military feeling about what's happened?
[00:59:20.361 --> 00:59:23.803]  Well, a lot of the military are very angry about what's happened.
[00:59:23.803 --> 00:59:25.364]  They don't like what they're seeing.
[00:59:25.364 --> 00:59:29.427]  The military, however, literally there is no democracy in the military.
[00:59:29.427 --> 00:59:36.331]  There's no freedom of speech because, you know, you're basically a foot soldier, literally, in the army, so you're the last person that was supposed to dissent.
[00:59:36.331 --> 00:59:38.332]  Many of them are threatened.
[00:59:38.332 --> 00:59:39.673]  They're threatened with court-martials.
[00:59:39.673 --> 00:59:42.635]  They're not allowed to express freedom of speech.
[00:59:42.635 --> 00:59:48.638]  I wish several would resign in protest to make a point, you know, like if there was a fellow that resigned from the government.
[00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:53.023]  Yeah, right, the Ambassador, to make the point.
[00:59:53.023 --> 00:59:54.345]  But the military is a little different.
[00:59:54.345 --> 01:00:01.054]  The Washington Times reported the lowest morale ever, ever at the Pentagon.
[01:00:01.054 --> 01:00:02.255]  Yeah.
[01:00:02.255 --> 01:00:04.138]  I know I spent 14 years in the service.
[01:00:04.138 --> 01:00:05.119]  I know if you don't
[01:00:05.748 --> 01:00:06.729]  We're good to go.
[01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.872]  You're right, it's a minority on the cutting edge of history.
[01:00:34.872 --> 01:00:36.212]  You're on that cutting edge.
[01:00:36.212 --> 01:00:41.295]  If we don't speak up now, our children won't have any future, will they?
[01:00:41.295 --> 01:00:42.816]  We're out of time with Stanley Hilton.
[01:00:42.816 --> 01:00:43.617]  I'll be right back.
[01:00:43.617 --> 01:00:44.037]  Stay with us.
