[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:02.010]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.770]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.371]  You want answers?
[00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:06.911]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:06.911 --> 00:00:11.093]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:15.194]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:42.909]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we're live, and it is already the eighth day of April, 2008.
[00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.573]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:53.632]  That's right, I am now taking on a fourth hour of syndicated radio.
[00:00:53.632 --> 00:01:02.993]  But for the next few weeks, for the time being, you will hear the fourth hour, basically commercial-free, as we develop and hone the fourth hour.
[00:01:02.993 --> 00:01:14.976]  It will have live video feeds on myself, my guest in studio, a document cam, a video feed where I can play video clips and audio clips, a computer screen feed, and much, much more.
[00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:16.936]  And then we're going to be taking these feeds
[00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:30.998]  Every day after the show, within a couple hours, and posting that fourth hour up on PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv members who may not have had a chance to watch the fourth hour as it's streamed.
[00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:37.022]  Now, of course, everybody can listen for free to the internet audio of the fourth hour.
[00:01:37.022 --> 00:01:40.724]  So, for now, it is an internet radio show in the fourth hour.
[00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:45.867]  We already had three affiliates call yesterday when I mentioned we're going to have a fourth hour.
[00:01:47.847 --> 00:02:03.079]  Call and say that they want the fourth hour, and so yes, you will hear the fourth hour on the GCN Radio Network a few weeks down the road, but right now we are beta testing this fourth hour live.
[00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.261]  And let me tell you, I went wild yesterday in the fourth hour.
[00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:07.482]  I went even over.
[00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:16.169]  I did one hour and 24 minutes extra, so four hours and 24 minute radio show yesterday, but I'm going to control myself in the future.
[00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:20.364]  It's going to be a four-hour radio show.
[00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:25.126]  I can't turn it into a four-and-a-half, a five, a six-hour radio show.
[00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:32.911]  And I did a little wild on the show yesterday, making some to think that this is going to be some type of Howard Sternian-type fourth hour.
[00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:34.512]  It's not.
[00:02:34.512 --> 00:02:36.093]  And I apologize for my behavior.
[00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:38.875]  I have to be honest with you.
[00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:45.759]  When I'm eating five huge meals a day and drinking a few beers at night and smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, I'm more relaxed and docile.
[00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:55.628]  But, uh, I haven't worked out like this in ten years, and I've been running twice a day, some days lifting weights, swimming, and I'm totally addicted now.
[00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:58.388]  I finally got back into the addiction mode of working out.
[00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:00.689]  I'm losing about two pounds a day.
[00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.511]  I'm completely crazed, and I probably shouldn't even be on radio.
[00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:09.172]  I mean, normally somebody can flip me off, uh, in traffic, and I don't even care.
[00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:12.013]  A couple days ago, it was like I was a teenager again.
[00:03:12.013 --> 00:03:16.214]  Somebody cut me off and flipped me off for no reason, and I almost ripped the steering wheel off the column.
[00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:19.423]  So, Lord knows what's going to happen here.
[00:03:19.423 --> 00:03:22.484]  I've just got to completely control myself.
[00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.885]  I forgot why I don't like being in shape.
[00:03:24.885 --> 00:03:28.726]  Because, I like, why I like being a happy blob.
[00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:30.826]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, I'm crazed now.
[00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:38.048]  I mean, you think I'm crazed when I'm in a docile, porcine-type mode, pinniped-type mode.
[00:03:38.048 --> 00:03:41.049]  Well, uh, this is the old Alex Jones.
[00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:41.949]  And I'm totally addicted.
[00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.430]  I can't wait to 3 o'clock to get out of here and go jog.
[00:03:47.153 --> 00:03:50.755]  I'm so addicted to working out again, I just happened to click about a month and a half ago.
[00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:58.220]  The other times I tried, it would never click like it used to when I was really young.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:11.389]  Normally I want to stay and work, and now I'm like, really lusting is the word, after leaving and jogging and running in the woods until I pull over to the side and vomit.
[00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.972]  Because I'm going to have a six-pack stomach again, and my eyes are going to bulge out of my head again.
[00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:19.566]  Alright, excuse me.
[00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:23.168]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:26.810]  Oh man, my testosterone level is just spiking.
[00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.892]  This weekend I'm gonna go do some full body weightlifting.
[00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:32.172]  Power clings and stuff.
[00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:34.193]  Totally weak, of course.
[00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:37.275]  Probably like 150 pounds.
[00:04:37.275 --> 00:04:38.895]  But that's how big things start.
[00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:41.917]  And I am gonna get in the old mode, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:42.757]  That's why I'm announcing it.
[00:04:42.757 --> 00:04:44.818]  Throwing down the gauntlet.
[00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:45.558]  I'm gonna weigh 180 pounds from
[00:04:48.508 --> 00:04:48.649]  250.
[00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:51.996]  I weighed 270 a month and a half ago when I started.
[00:04:51.996 --> 00:04:55.062]  That's right.
[00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:56.405]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:57.532 --> 00:04:59.273]  A New World Order.
[00:04:59.273 --> 00:05:03.435]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:07.017]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:09.799]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:12.981]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:20.305]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:23.325 --> 00:05:28.767]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:32.649]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:35.209]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:36.370]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.150]  They're not after money.
[00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.431]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:39.411]  They're after power.
[00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:40.571]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:44.713]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:06:47.268 --> 00:06:47.448]  That's 646-498-5309.
[00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.101]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:59.385]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:04.370]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.253]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:07:07.253 --> 00:07:14.101]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:20.304]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:22.424]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[00:07:22.424 --> 00:07:26.706]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:07:26.706 --> 00:07:31.288]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong.
[00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:38.135]  That they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[00:07:38.135 --> 00:07:43.420]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.704]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[00:07:46.704 --> 00:07:47.224]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:07:47.224 --> 00:07:48.886]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today!
[00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:58.258]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:58.258 --> 00:08:01.061]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:30.493]  Taking off the gloves, pulling down all the stops, strap yourselves in, get ready.
[00:08:30.493 --> 00:08:31.954]  You just found it.
[00:08:31.954 --> 00:08:35.656]  You just parachuted right into the front lines of the info war.
[00:08:35.656 --> 00:08:38.178]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.178 --> 00:08:44.223]  I have awakened tens of millions globally with your help, and we will go on to wake up billions together.
[00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:50.628]  All right, here is the news that we have in front of us today.
[00:08:53.564 --> 00:08:54.945]  Secret plans for U.S.
[00:08:54.945 --> 00:08:59.448]  troops to stay in Iraq indefinitely.
[00:08:59.448 --> 00:09:00.269]  We'll cover that.
[00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:05.632]  Homeland spy satellite plan ignores Constitution.
[00:09:05.632 --> 00:09:06.393]  Well, it's just a G.D.
[00:09:06.393 --> 00:09:08.094]  piece of paper, according to Bush.
[00:09:08.094 --> 00:09:10.115]  Foreign banks flee Spanish property debt.
[00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:12.877]  That's right, the mortgage crisis spreads globally.
[00:09:12.877 --> 00:09:13.317]  U.S.
[00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:18.561]  jobless figures, the specter of a new depression.
[00:09:18.561 --> 00:09:19.842]  Folks have dug up the
[00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:26.408]  Transcripts of Charlton Heston on national television supporting the 68 gun control act.
[00:09:26.408 --> 00:09:31.210]  I've got comments on this and I'm gonna cover it and talk about it today.
[00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:35.132]  And more on Heston as we remember him this week.
[00:09:35.132 --> 00:09:42.055]  Rabbi says life of one yeshiva boy worth more than a thousand Arabs.
[00:09:42.055 --> 00:09:44.236]  This is out of Ynet News.
[00:09:44.236 --> 00:09:48.958]  You know, last night I sent this to Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson and they posted it on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:55.896]  And people are in the comment section saying, this site better stop this, this is anti-semitic.
[00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:58.498]  They'll think we're all anti-semitic if you post this.
[00:09:58.498 --> 00:10:03.282]  This is a major Israeli newspaper and magazine.
[00:10:03.282 --> 00:10:07.925]  This is an Israeli news story.
[00:10:07.925 --> 00:10:19.294]  Okay, and I've protested the Ku Klux Klan, I've protested Mecha and Laraza, and I have always protested the fact that large sectors of the Israeli population
[00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:26.735]  Openly say that everyone but them are animals.
[00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:33.877]  And it's very sad to have to talk about this, but I'm going to talk about it.
[00:10:33.877 --> 00:10:47.440]  And to the people that are so programmed against discussing this, we just need to face the facts that most groups are tribal, most groups think everybody else is subhuman, and this is how the globalists control us and manipulate us.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:57.123]  It's just terrible when Pastor Hagee says that he rejoices every time he hears about a Palestinian child being killed.
[00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.424]  That's a quote.
[00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:08.268]  And it's disgusting when they have televised programs in Israel where these types of things are said and then we're not supposed to talk about it.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:19.082]  But it's also distasteful, uh, the people that basically say Jews are evil and their own species of evil and that evil comes from Jews only.
[00:11:19.082 --> 00:11:22.163]  We would have a utopian world system if they didn't exist.
[00:11:22.163 --> 00:11:24.944]  That is not the case.
[00:11:24.944 --> 00:11:28.385]  So, uh, we'll, uh, break that down today.
[00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:31.006]  Just like all Mexicans in the U.S.
[00:11:31.006 --> 00:11:37.848]  aren't Larry Conquistas saying all whites need to be killed, but a large section is.
[00:11:37.848 --> 00:11:39.408]  And so I'm forced to talk about it.
[00:11:43.168 --> 00:11:45.309]  And I don't like it.
[00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:48.031]  But I have to just tell it like it is.
[00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:51.933]  So I'll talk about race today.
[00:11:51.933 --> 00:11:55.095]  That is just some of the news that I have here in front of me.
[00:11:55.095 --> 00:11:57.377]  I never got to this yesterday like I should have.
[00:11:57.377 --> 00:12:03.400]  Web could collapse as video demand soars.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.023]  I want to get into that some today.
[00:12:10.598 --> 00:12:21.064]  And then they also, out of the same newspaper, tell you, in relation, they have a link to a similar article they wrote days before, that says, Superfast Internet may replace World Wide Web.
[00:12:21.064 --> 00:12:24.786]  So see, oh, the web's going to collapse, but don't worry, there's a replacement.
[00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:36.792]  As I've been telling you for six years now, not because I'm smart, not because I have a crystal ball, I actually read what the industry says.
[00:12:36.792 --> 00:12:37.753]  Here's an example of that.
[00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:45.443]  Hundreds of thousands of business owners and executives.
[00:12:45.443 --> 00:12:49.063]  You can even own a small business like I do.
[00:12:49.063 --> 00:12:55.104]  And you get on the CEO and manager list, and every day I get magazines like this in the mail.
[00:12:55.104 --> 00:13:00.785]  I mean, every day this stuff comes in.
[00:13:00.785 --> 00:13:02.886]  And I've been on one of these lists about seven, eight years.
[00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:06.106]  You know, this stuff's been coming in since about, actually about 99.
[00:13:06.106 --> 00:13:07.867]  Man, how time flies.
[00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:09.067]  Finance and development.
[00:13:11.428 --> 00:13:25.112]  This is a industry specialist slash CEO manager specialized type publication.
[00:13:25.112 --> 00:13:26.912]  The general public doesn't read this.
[00:13:26.912 --> 00:13:29.533]  Global Governance.
[00:13:29.533 --> 00:13:30.913]  And we had this mailed in to us.
[00:13:30.913 --> 00:13:36.074]  A listener also mailed us a copy of this, so somebody else out there thought this was important.
[00:13:36.074 --> 00:13:36.975]  Global Governance.
[00:13:36.975 --> 00:13:38.375]  Who is in charge?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.160]  Then you read it and they admit we're under a global government.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:56.323]  Now, that's one thing for those that are seen as the establishment, the hundred or thousand so small and medium-sized business owners in the U.S.
[00:13:56.323 --> 00:14:04.865]  And then you get into more elite publications that the CFR puts out that are public but not highly circulated, and it's even worse, the things they talk about.
[00:14:04.865 --> 00:14:07.525]  And then you try to tell the man on the street what's going on, they just laugh at you.
[00:14:10.063 --> 00:14:26.436]  But that's how I knew about Internet, too, six years ago, was I was reading Internet industry publications and technology publications that were mailed to me.
[00:14:26.436 --> 00:14:36.424]  Because the establishment mails this out to basically anybody that owns a technology company or an Internet business of any size, and it's their PR, it's their propaganda, it's how great it is.
[00:14:36.424 --> 00:14:39.106]  Oh, we're gonna, within the next ten years, or sooner,
[00:14:39.736 --> 00:14:41.137]  This is about six years ago.
[00:14:41.137 --> 00:14:42.077]  Shut the internet down.
[00:14:42.077 --> 00:14:42.858]  This is how we're going to do it.
[00:14:42.858 --> 00:15:04.411]  We're going to force everybody over to it, but it's going to be really profitable for the select few, and it's going to be faster for everybody, and you're going to have your personal computing info, the general public will, on a remote server, and you'll just have a template that dials into it, and everybody's going to have subdomains on larger 100 domains, 50 industry, 50 government, slash university.
[00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:09.596]  And then I said, boy, I better go read what Internet 2 is.
[00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:16.139]  So I googled it and found their meetings in Chicago and London and Austin, and every year they have them.
[00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:20.440]  And they openly talk about how they're going to take the Internet away from you, and it's not going to be the free Internet anymore.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.601]  It's not going to be what it's been.
[00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:25.782]  So let me now just briefly break that down.
[00:15:25.782 --> 00:15:33.845]  Then I'm going to get into Jesse Ventura saying that the American people have a right to arm rebellion against the tyranny of this government, which is in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.171]  And then we're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:43.032]  Take a lot of calls in the second, third, and fourth hour.
[00:15:43.032 --> 00:15:46.213]  That's right, we now do a fourth hour.
[00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:53.555]  Ted Anderson called me yesterday and he said, listen, I want to put your show on right now, on the network in the fourth hour.
[00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:55.656]  And I said, no, Ted, hold off.
[00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:59.217]  I just, you know, I don't even want to step on people's toes.
[00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:01.538]  If people don't think they need to move their shows up later, that's fine.
[00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.696]  In fact, I'll just rent a Star Guide myself or whatever.
[00:16:04.696 --> 00:16:09.479]  Ted's welcome to run his ads over it or we'll do something like that.
[00:16:09.479 --> 00:16:10.800]  And I'm kind of having fun.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.542]  I know a lot of stations want it and you're going to get it.
[00:16:13.542 --> 00:16:18.865]  In fact, I need to call a shortwave and see if they'll pick up the 4th Hour WWCR.
[00:16:18.865 --> 00:16:20.626]  And that's all going to come in time.
[00:16:20.626 --> 00:16:24.389]  But 75% of the public have computers and are connectable.
[00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:29.852]  And so you can tune into the 4th Hour now via InfoWars.com, the streams that are there on the site.
[00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:35.038]  But Ted is chomping at the bit to get the show.
[00:16:35.038 --> 00:16:36.520]  He goes, no, no, I'm picking it up.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.064]  I'm like, no, don't move it, Ted.
[00:16:40.064 --> 00:16:42.547]  Just let people figure it out for themselves.
[00:16:42.547 --> 00:16:46.412]  And I think Deagle's already called up wanting that common sense approach.
[00:16:52.788 --> 00:16:58.411]  But again, a fourth hour of the radio show, ladies and gentlemen, with video cams here in studio.
[00:16:58.411 --> 00:17:03.853]  We beta tested it, had a few glitches the first ten minutes with the video cams, but then it was up and running great after that.
[00:17:03.853 --> 00:17:10.596]  And today's show... Yesterday's show has been up, but we haven't posted it yet.
[00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:17.359]  Yesterday's show and today's show will be up this afternoon for you, and then five days a week you're gonna have the show up there.
[00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.800]  Now, a few days a week, sometimes.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.080]  Sometimes.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.061]  Some days I'll do five days a week, some days I'll do three days a week.
[00:17:21.994 --> 00:17:32.684]  I'd say on average, you know, I'll probably not do five or six shows a month live in that fourth hour, because we're going to give you special, original video never before seen.
[00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:40.611]  Like later this week, I'm going to play just about five, ten minutes, I'm not sure right now, we're editing it together, from the upcoming JFK film I'm making.
[00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:45.656]  You'll have a live sneak peek in that fourth hour.
[00:17:45.656 --> 00:17:46.737]  Man, isn't the web wonderful?
[00:17:47.777 --> 00:18:10.184]  Breaking the monopoly of the big corporations whose media empires are literally imploding, whose news propaganda empires are imploding, whose newspaper propaganda empires are falling apart in front of us, collapsing, as they just keep slapping their lies and it falls flat on their face.
[00:18:10.184 --> 00:18:12.025]  So what are they going to do?
[00:18:12.025 --> 00:18:16.026]  Well, it's just like what England is doing and now the U.S.
[00:18:16.026 --> 00:18:16.626]  and Germany.
[00:18:17.256 --> 00:18:22.838]  They take an existing road, and they make you put a transponder in your car, and they tax you to drive on the main roads.
[00:18:22.838 --> 00:18:34.943]  The BBC reported, what, three days ago, that the average cost will be £54.50-plus pounds per day to drive into London.
[00:18:34.943 --> 00:18:39.525]  And they said, don't worry, it's only going to be £20 a day driving in the rest of the country.
[00:18:39.525 --> 00:18:41.806]  Every road will have a transponder in it.
[00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:44.262]  Every car will have it.
[00:18:44.262 --> 00:18:46.003]  Every road, you will be taxed.
[00:18:46.003 --> 00:18:48.645]  And San Francisco was doing this seven years ago.
[00:18:48.645 --> 00:18:50.767]  They will track everywhere you go with the transponders.
[00:18:50.767 --> 00:18:52.068]  And now it's coming out all over the country.
[00:18:52.068 --> 00:18:53.789]  The police are doing that.
[00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:54.589]  You don't have a cell phone.
[00:18:54.589 --> 00:18:57.391]  They just dial in and track your transponder from point to point.
[00:18:57.391 --> 00:19:03.296]  And so they know every 300, 400 yards or so, where you're at.
[00:19:03.296 --> 00:19:05.998]  All Big Brother, all Pentagon designed.
[00:19:05.998 --> 00:19:09.380]  And they turn your car into a literal taxi cab.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:29.552]  The Texas Department of Transportation said three years ago that it will be $165 to drive from Austin to Dallas and back.
[00:19:29.552 --> 00:19:31.494]  One way, I guess, would be what's half of $160-something?
[00:19:31.494 --> 00:19:31.594]  $80-plus?
[00:19:40.819 --> 00:19:42.761]  And that's just a start!
[00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:45.224]  Oh, I'm sorry, I was talking about Internet.
[00:19:45.224 --> 00:19:48.128]  But see, they all have the same tricks.
[00:19:48.128 --> 00:19:51.371]  They're gonna put taxes on it, kill net neutrality.
[00:19:51.371 --> 00:19:52.533]  Let me tell you about it when we get back.
[00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.669]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:08.138]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:08.138 --> 00:20:15.244]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:21.931]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:32.721]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:33.502 --> 00:20:33.923]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:33.923 --> 00:20:34.883]  A new world order.
[00:20:34.883 --> 00:20:36.244]  In the near future.
[00:21:01.184 --> 00:21:04.225]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:04.225 --> 00:21:07.065]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:09.866]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:09.866 --> 00:21:13.047]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:13.047 --> 00:21:20.369]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:23.413 --> 00:21:28.837]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:28.837 --> 00:21:32.779]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:32.779 --> 00:21:35.581]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:21:54.193 --> 00:21:59.276]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:03.159]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[00:22:03.159 --> 00:22:12.844]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[00:22:12.844 --> 00:22:17.247]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[00:22:17.247 --> 00:22:20.889]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:31.380]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.506]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[00:22:36.506 --> 00:22:39.189]  Put the Champion Juicer to work for you and your family.
[00:22:39.329 --> 00:22:44.036]  Get creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy fresh flour.
[00:22:44.036 --> 00:22:48.262]  The Champion Juicer also makes great nut butters and frozen sorbets.
[00:22:48.262 --> 00:22:50.945]  The world's finest juicer is Champion Juicer.

[00:22:53.914 --> 00:23:07.045]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:23:07.045 --> 00:23:18.133]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:23:18.133 --> 00:23:20.275]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:23:21.536 --> 00:23:23.277]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:23:23.277 --> 00:23:29.400]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:47.672]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[00:23:47.672 --> 00:23:52.997]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:24:31.357 --> 00:24:38.301]  You tell them, woman.
[00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:42.664]  Listen how beautiful that voice is.
[00:24:42.664 --> 00:24:43.244]  Crank her up.
[00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:53.754]  Alright, as much as I like it, we've got to cut it out.
[00:25:53.754 --> 00:25:59.538]  Coming up, Senator Arnold Spector confronted on magic bullet theory.
[00:25:59.538 --> 00:26:00.299]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:26:00.299 --> 00:26:02.461]  We're going to be playing the audio of that video.
[00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:04.342]  This is up on JonesReport.com.
[00:26:07.435 --> 00:26:10.557]  We'll be discussing that.
[00:26:10.557 --> 00:26:14.259]  Getting back to internet, too, I'm going to come back with the Jesse Ventura News.
[00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:17.641]  And then, of course, the new info.
[00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:18.902]  Secret plans for U.S.
[00:26:18.902 --> 00:26:21.323]  troops to stay in Iraq forever.
[00:26:21.323 --> 00:26:24.165]  Of course, we told you about that before the war.
[00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:26.086]  But now that's finally breaking into news.
[00:26:26.086 --> 00:26:29.969]  Now the media is being allowed to report on all this.
[00:26:29.969 --> 00:26:30.809]  I don't know why.
[00:26:30.809 --> 00:26:31.650]  We could debate that.
[00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.412]  We could discuss that.
[00:26:35.412 --> 00:26:37.033]  Well, I do know why, to a certain extent.
[00:26:38.635 --> 00:26:43.217]  To ask the question is to generally get the answer if you actually think about it.
[00:26:43.217 --> 00:26:48.539]  But what they're going to do is a combination of things.
[00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:59.965]  There are hundreds of main hubs and switches for the internet and the internet to people, which is the international private corporations who set the standards and then basically order government to adopt those standards.
[00:26:59.965 --> 00:27:04.507]  And they have government and the heads of all the fortune, you know, 100 technology companies.
[00:27:04.507 --> 00:27:05.107]  They're all there.
[00:27:06.476 --> 00:27:11.379]  You can go read the transcripts, the meetings, type in the Internet is dead, Internet 2.
[00:27:11.379 --> 00:27:12.859]  They put that announcement out every year.
[00:27:12.859 --> 00:27:16.241]  You'll see hundreds of articles with that in the headline or in the story.
[00:27:16.241 --> 00:27:20.644]  That's their slogan.
[00:27:20.644 --> 00:27:24.486]  And they talk about how they're letting the web grow, how the government created it.
[00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:29.268]  Now it's the government's right with the elites to take it back over.
[00:27:29.268 --> 00:27:32.670]  And they say that they're going to let the hubs break down and fall apart.
[00:27:33.988 --> 00:27:49.976]  And that the universities and institutions and government facilities and private corporations that are upkeeping the main hubs are just going to have government change the law where they don't even have to provide connectivity and cross through of data.
[00:27:49.976 --> 00:27:51.036]  But they say that's not enough.
[00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:56.439]  They're just not going to upgrade them and that it's their right that when that stuff breaks to just not offer it.
[00:27:58.396 --> 00:28:05.338]  But they say before they can get to that point, they've got to get Internet 2.0 up and get more people using it, which they're now doing.
[00:28:05.338 --> 00:28:06.498]  And it's hyper-fast.
[00:28:06.498 --> 00:28:26.544]  I mean, high-definition TV, movies, music in, you know, perfect sound quality, live performances, data transmission, just, just... They're working on holograms where somebody's projected to be doing this for decades as a hologram on the desk,
[00:28:26.869 --> 00:28:29.410]  Where you have virtual meetings, where everybody's in the room.
[00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.311]  This is all coming.
[00:28:30.311 --> 00:28:37.275]  It's a three-camera shoot on a simple computer platform.
[00:28:37.275 --> 00:28:37.775]  Movies.
[00:28:37.775 --> 00:28:44.639]  Within about ten years, you're gonna have theaters, or sooner, nationwide, where you go in and it's a 3D hologram movie.
[00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:46.540]  That's why you don't ever hear about James Cameron anymore.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.522]  He took his five billion dollars and that's all he works on, all he does, 24-7.
[00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:56.641]  And I know people that have been inside the secretive areas, not just the public areas.
[00:28:56.641 --> 00:28:58.282]  It's unbelievable.
[00:28:58.282 --> 00:29:03.746]  It makes the holograms in fiction movies like Star Wars look like child's play.
[00:29:03.746 --> 00:29:12.352]  And I remember being a little kid going to Disneyland and going to the Haunted House and they had 3D ghosts that were 3D flying around.
[00:29:12.352 --> 00:29:17.336]  That's 40-year-old technology with projectors, but I'm digressing here.
[00:29:17.336 --> 00:29:22.059]  So they're going to tantalize you onto the new web where there's, well, I'm going to finish up when we get back.
[00:29:22.824 --> 00:29:34.011]  We'll get into Ventura, we'll get into the war, there's just so much, and I'm really going to try to cover all the news first today, then take a bunch of your calls.
[00:29:34.011 --> 00:29:45.118]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[00:29:45.118 --> 00:29:49.041]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.041 --> 00:29:51.743]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.034 --> 00:29:59.557]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:29:59.557 --> 00:30:04.660]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.180]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[00:31:57.662 --> 00:32:00.603]  Are you going to be the one in four who gets cancer in their lifetime?
[00:32:00.603 --> 00:32:04.565]  Well, now you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with Alka-Vita.

[00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.052]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away?
[00:32:21.052 --> 00:32:22.653]  Those words of wisdom are true.
[00:32:22.653 --> 00:32:30.378]  Your body heals itself when eating well, rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like corn syrup, sugar, preservatives, and other unpronounceable ingredients.

[00:33:12.734 --> 00:33:14.395]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:33:14.395 --> 00:33:15.315]  until 3 p.m., 4 hours.
[00:33:15.315 --> 00:33:18.997]  Up on our game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:20.098]  Never backing down.
[00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:24.019]  Engaging the New World Order at point-blank range.
[00:33:58.505 --> 00:34:01.088]  Oh, that's poetry, is it not?
[00:34:01.088 --> 00:34:02.209]  I love it!
[00:34:43.392 --> 00:34:45.193]  Okay, let's get back into Internet 2.
[00:34:45.193 --> 00:34:50.336]  How they're going to shut down the Internet.
[00:34:50.336 --> 00:34:53.678]  See, it's just like you domesticate a hog.
[00:34:53.678 --> 00:34:57.961]  You've got wild hogs on your property, and they're very destructive.
[00:34:57.961 --> 00:35:01.423]  I mean, a group of 10, 15 hogs, sometimes they're in bands of 30, 40, 50.
[00:35:01.423 --> 00:35:04.505]  The biggest I've seen is about 50.
[00:35:04.505 --> 00:35:08.788]  They'll come in an entire corn field, an entire field of soybeans.
[00:35:08.788 --> 00:35:09.488]  It could be anything.
[00:35:10.236 --> 00:35:11.776]  They will just destroy it.
[00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:16.077]  They just turn the ground over like tractors.
[00:35:16.077 --> 00:35:21.658]  And even domesticated pigs in a few generations grow long hair, big tusks.
[00:35:21.658 --> 00:35:24.619]  They go wild.
[00:35:24.619 --> 00:35:28.060]  And you've got to trap them or they'll destroy your property.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.300]  And they've... Just type in Texas infestation wild hogs.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.881]  I mean, they're destroying everything.
[00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:35.481]  There's coyotes running wild everywhere.
[00:35:35.481 --> 00:35:37.301]  There was one by our house the other day.
[00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:38.182]  Freaking the neighbors out.
[00:35:38.182 --> 00:35:39.602]  They think it's like a wolf that's going to eat them.
[00:35:39.602 --> 00:35:40.102]  It's pretty funny.
[00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:42.599]  They will eat your house dogs and cats though.
[00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:43.679]  They'll even attack big dogs.
[00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:45.600]  A group of coyotes will and they'll eat it.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.880]  But not usually people.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.481]  Wolves do attack people though.
[00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:53.523]  But I'm already digressing here.
[00:35:53.523 --> 00:36:05.607]  How did I start talking about Internet 2 and get off into invasive species?
[00:36:05.607 --> 00:36:08.728]  You see, I start talking about
[00:36:09.813 --> 00:36:16.975]  The internet, now they're going to take it over and then I start talking about toll roads, how they put tolls on existing roads because it's a parallel, it's the same system.
[00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:25.358]  Oh yeah, I got off into invasive species because they treat us like wild hogs.
[00:36:25.358 --> 00:36:27.699]  Or how any animal was domesticated.
[00:36:27.699 --> 00:36:36.242]  How do you think our ancestors, 6,000, 7,000 years ago, began domesticating horses?
[00:36:36.242 --> 00:36:39.203]  Well, they started feeding them.
[00:36:42.432 --> 00:36:44.674]  They started getting them up near their camp.
[00:36:44.674 --> 00:36:52.039]  They started building little corrals and then putting food out each day till the horses came in and felt safe there.
[00:36:52.039 --> 00:36:55.841]  And then they would close the door.
[00:36:55.841 --> 00:37:07.269]  And then they would, over the next month or so, give the horse more food, take care of it, basically train it to the point of where man finally got on the back of the horse.
[00:37:10.745 --> 00:37:35.535]  Now some anthropologists and the behaviors that study human interactivity with domesticated animals will say that more likely a big cat or something would kill a mother horse and that then humans would capture and domesticate a baby colt and then take care of it and raise it.
[00:37:35.535 --> 00:37:38.376]  And that's certainly how dogs, that's certainly how we brought wolves in.
[00:37:39.542 --> 00:37:40.323]  A puppy's cute.
[00:37:40.323 --> 00:37:42.585]  Even a wolf puppy is very cute.
[00:37:42.585 --> 00:37:44.987]  And so we know that's how that happened.
[00:37:44.987 --> 00:37:46.888]  But this is the opposite domestication.
[00:37:46.888 --> 00:37:47.769]  This is the elite.
[00:37:47.769 --> 00:37:49.550]  Because humans are predators.
[00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.393]  And this is an elite that operate as predators.
[00:37:52.393 --> 00:37:58.918]  And they're using us, the sub-oids, to use a Frank Herbert term.
[00:37:58.918 --> 00:38:00.980]  He also coined Prison Planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.742]  That's where I got the term.
[00:38:03.742 --> 00:38:06.084]  Not from the ridiculous Scientologists, as some say.
[00:38:06.084 --> 00:38:06.985]  I got it from Frank Herbert.
[00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:13.931]  In his prison planet.
[00:38:13.931 --> 00:38:20.432]  The prison planet where people were sent by the Padishah Emperor.
[00:38:20.432 --> 00:38:24.593]  I'm already digressing.
[00:38:24.593 --> 00:38:34.855]  So, the way you domesticate, well, you don't want to domesticate the wild hogs, you want to get them into the pen to kill them.
[00:38:34.855 --> 00:38:37.556]  But it's the same thing for domestication of goats, sheep,
[00:38:39.304 --> 00:38:46.989]  Chickens, bovine, that's how they got the water buffalo, and then others, which is the same thing as a cow, just wild.
[00:38:46.989 --> 00:38:49.850]  Hadn't been bred yet.
[00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:54.753]  Hadn't been genetically selected for being docile, having a lot of meat on its bones.
[00:38:54.753 --> 00:39:04.339]  You trick the hogs to come in to the fenced area, and you got a timer on the fence, and so
[00:39:05.562 --> 00:39:15.470]  Uh, you've got a grain dispenser, or if you want to lure them in, maybe something that dispenses sugar cubes, a type of range cube with molasses.
[00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:22.475]  And the gate's open, and for a month it spews out some sugar cubes, when the gate doesn't close.
[00:39:22.475 --> 00:39:27.559]  Because at first, little stupid piglets are going to run in there, and sows are going to run in there.
[00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:34.925]  And the big boar, who normally runs things, the biggest, fattest, meanest one, he'll even nuzzle them and gripe at them and squeal at them and tell them not to go in.
[00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:41.092]  They'll finally go in and eat, and he'll see that they're eating, and see that it's safe, and he'll finally go in after a few weeks.
[00:39:41.092 --> 00:39:45.794]  Then the timer goes off, and the gate shuts.
[00:39:45.794 --> 00:39:49.757]  Now you've gotta, for a couple weeks though, not know when they're finally gonna take the bait.
[00:39:49.757 --> 00:39:58.721]  You gotta be waiting in a pickup truck down the road, and show up five minutes after the timer goes off, because the pigs will go crazy, and start ramming it, they'll dig under it, and they'll get out.
[00:39:58.721 --> 00:40:03.504]  And you gotta jump out with your semi-automatic rifle, and run up, and shoot them.
[00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.012]  And by the way, for the animal lovers, don't be stupid.
[00:40:09.012 --> 00:40:11.553]  Did you know wild hogs eat baby fawns?
[00:40:11.553 --> 00:40:13.154]  They eat baby deer.
[00:40:13.154 --> 00:40:15.016]  And they also drive the deer out and destroy their habitat.
[00:40:15.016 --> 00:40:18.198]  It's an invasive species, environmental fools.
[00:40:18.198 --> 00:40:19.959]  This is real environmentalism.
[00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:27.424]  It's nothing, believe me, it's not fun shooting 15 hogs as they squeal with gouts of blood squirting in every direction.
[00:40:27.424 --> 00:40:31.947]  And then having to load them on the backs of trucks or drag them with tractors in
[00:40:33.096 --> 00:40:35.138]  Uh, and then give them to locals who butcher them.
[00:40:35.138 --> 00:40:37.579]  The local poor do butcher them and do eat it.
[00:40:37.579 --> 00:40:40.061]  Well, I just ate some a few weeks ago when I was out visiting family.
[00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:48.147]  The problem is hogs are so smart that all of them never go into the pen, and then once the rest of them have seen that, they never go in again.
[00:40:48.147 --> 00:40:53.311]  The hogs destroying our property now will not go into pens, will not go into the traps.
[00:40:53.311 --> 00:40:56.533]  It's the smartest land animal next to humans and the elephant.
[00:40:58.652 --> 00:41:03.595]  Poor scenes are smart, ladies and gentlemen, and, I mean, they're like twice as smart as a dog.
[00:41:03.595 --> 00:41:06.297]  Their nose is many times better than a dog's.
[00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:08.118]  And they're vicious.
[00:41:08.118 --> 00:41:11.180]  And they're just unstoppable.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:17.684]  But I've already digressed.
[00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:20.345]  The point here is, is that's what's happened with Internet.
[00:41:20.345 --> 00:41:28.250]  They build the Internet, they let you use it, they let you get addicted to it, and they, the social planners, and I'm not saying their gods are perfect, I think they've miscalculated,
[00:41:29.022 --> 00:41:42.885]  Wrote 30 years ago, I've just now been discovering this stuff, that they were going to build it, let us have it, and then take control of it and use it as World Wide Web was called by the NSA World Wired, what wiretap?
[00:41:42.885 --> 00:41:46.245]  World Wide Wiretap.
[00:41:46.245 --> 00:41:55.267]  And the globalists want everything interconnected where no nation can stand against another, so there's just this global financial oligarchy above it, and they believe the web is going to tie us all together, which it's doing.
[00:41:56.653 --> 00:42:09.137]  And they predicted there'd be free speech and flash mobs and people waking up, though not to this level.
[00:42:09.137 --> 00:42:19.140]  So, what they're going to do is let the old hubs break down and let there be more and more failure.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.161]  And they've been saying this for at least four years.
[00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:26.242]  I've learned about it six years ago, but for four years they've been saying, as the connectivity breaks down,
[00:42:27.114 --> 00:42:36.116]  Even if governments say they've got to have net neutrality because the population forces it, 90 plus percent of people in major polls want net neutrality.
[00:42:36.116 --> 00:42:44.178]  Even Ron Paul changed his position on that and finally figured out what it meant.
[00:42:44.178 --> 00:42:46.899]  They'll say, hey, we don't have to provide this.
[00:42:46.899 --> 00:42:48.819]  We're on this new system.
[00:42:48.819 --> 00:42:55.221]  And on that new system, you will have, say, University of Texas dot edu slash InfoWars.
[00:42:58.106 --> 00:43:01.230]  Or slash Fox News.
[00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:05.755]  Or slash Gov.
[00:43:05.755 --> 00:43:07.978]  And they will decide if you're allowed to have a website.
[00:43:07.978 --> 00:43:10.781]  It'll be like MySpace, but more controlling.
[00:43:10.781 --> 00:43:11.983]  What videos you can post.
[00:43:11.983 --> 00:43:14.686]  What bulletins you can send out.
[00:43:14.686 --> 00:43:17.610]  Everything is moving towards forcing you onto their hubs.
[00:43:18.416 --> 00:43:29.484]  Where it's like Dig, where they can censor what they want, or where you notice my bulletins most the time, everybody points out, and MySpace has admitted it in memos they've put out, they've told people, yes, this is a ban.
[00:43:29.484 --> 00:43:37.469]  Alex Jones' Prison Planet isn't allowed to be sent out, even to members of his MySpace account.
[00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:46.416]  And universities, and Comcast, and libraries, we're in the software that are sold by companies that block.
[00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:46.876]  We're in with
[00:43:48.047 --> 00:43:53.812]  Terror and porn and hacking and gambling.
[00:43:53.812 --> 00:43:56.874]  So you already see the model of that.
[00:43:56.874 --> 00:44:04.781]  But people then figure out that things like Digg or Myspace are controlled so they migrate away from them, so they have to force you onto that.
[00:44:04.781 --> 00:44:09.364]  There's also the taxation.
[00:44:09.364 --> 00:44:13.648]  They're going to tax emails, they're going to tax internet connections,
[00:44:15.182 --> 00:44:19.824]  Also, the new web is going to be such high speed that it's going to be expensive.
[00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:22.965]  We're talking about $75 to be on Internet2 a month.
[00:44:22.965 --> 00:44:30.608]  That'll cut out a lot of people out of the market.
[00:44:30.608 --> 00:44:38.150]  This is the system that they are creating.
[00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:42.732]  They're also passing hate speech laws so they can shut people down and kick them off of the web.
[00:44:45.856 --> 00:44:54.038]  I mean, there are people in Canada and people in Germany, people all over, who get criticized because they don't bash Israel.
[00:44:54.038 --> 00:44:58.479]  They get arrested if they do.
[00:44:58.479 --> 00:45:12.263]  That's the world, or if you criticize some group, or you say, I don't want a million Turks a year coming into Germany, or I don't want a million Middle Easterners coming in.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.401]  You see, this is the control grid.
[00:45:19.401 --> 00:45:21.223]  They're also attacking free speech.
[00:45:21.223 --> 00:45:30.370]  And see, the government of France is suing Yahoo, trying to make them not allow Yahoo to have sub-websites that, you know, criticize Israel.
[00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:31.871]  And so trying to shut people down.
[00:45:31.871 --> 00:45:36.254]  And then if Yahoo is forced to do that there, then they'll be forced to do that here.
[00:45:36.254 --> 00:45:38.556]  You see, this is all happening.
[00:45:38.556 --> 00:45:42.559]  So there's a multi-faceted, multivariate attack going on.
[00:45:45.922 --> 00:45:56.191]  And you see constant demonization, you see constant attacks, using the worst examples of what freedom creates.
[00:45:56.191 --> 00:46:04.618]  The scummiest porn, the scummiest violence, the horrible stalking, really bad things that go on on the internet.
[00:46:04.618 --> 00:46:10.082]  And then every night on the news they say, see look at this, look at this, look how horrible it is.
[00:46:10.082 --> 00:46:12.184]  A woman being raped and then it's put on YouTube.
[00:46:15.785 --> 00:46:20.726]  And then, oh, we've got to all lose our rights now.
[00:46:20.726 --> 00:46:21.707]  You see?
[00:46:21.707 --> 00:46:25.428]  So they're doing a job on us, and we're now only a few years away from this.
[00:46:25.428 --> 00:46:30.669]  You're already hearing about Comcast and others blocking whole sections of their competition's traffic.
[00:46:30.669 --> 00:46:32.430]  You're already seeing web breakdowns.
[00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:34.390]  Remember, what was it, two years ago?
[00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.191]  For like a month and a half?
[00:46:36.191 --> 00:46:38.612]  About a fourth of the websites you couldn't get to, remember?
[00:46:38.612 --> 00:46:40.632]  And it was because two companies?
[00:46:40.632 --> 00:46:43.333]  Was it Level 2 and Cogent?
[00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:48.630]  It's Level 2 or is that company called Level 3?
[00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:49.791]  Level 3 was the company.
[00:46:49.791 --> 00:46:51.812]  Okay, Level 3 and Cogent.
[00:46:51.812 --> 00:46:53.232]  And they were middle tier.
[00:46:53.232 --> 00:46:58.154]  They're not even top tier major infrastructure folks.
[00:46:58.154 --> 00:47:03.036]  And now Cisco's talking about, you know, kind of melding Internet 2 over Internet 1.
[00:47:03.036 --> 00:47:07.058]  So, that's what they plan.
[00:47:07.058 --> 00:47:11.820]  Now, if we're able to get the word out about this, they're not going to be able to do it.
[00:47:13.507 --> 00:47:42.772]  And even if I disagree with the Lorican Quistas, which are probably about half or more of the people in Mexico, and probably about a third of the people in this country who are Hispanic, who believe that this is Mexico, the Southwest, that want to kill all whites, even, you know, I have to defend their free speech to talk like that, as long as they don't, say, put it into action, because even though I hate their speech and dislike it, I have to stand by their right.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.121]  Or I will lose mine.
[00:47:45.121 --> 00:47:53.166]  Khalid Mohammed would say, you know, kill all the white women because they're the military manufacturing center.
[00:47:53.166 --> 00:47:58.329]  And, you know, probably 10-15% of blacks from the studies I've looked at believe like that.
[00:47:58.329 --> 00:48:02.232]  Does that mean that we should take their free speech?
[00:48:02.232 --> 00:48:03.873]  No.
[00:48:03.873 --> 00:48:13.159]  And you've got some extreme white supremacists who say, you know, we need to go ahead and have a race war and start killing people, and I totally disagree with that.
[00:48:14.557 --> 00:48:21.903]  But you need to understand that we can't take their free speech away because most of the time they're feds.
[00:48:21.903 --> 00:48:24.786]  Or they're being handled by feds and don't even know it.
[00:48:24.786 --> 00:48:29.890]  And if you take their rights away, then everyone loses their rights.
[00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:35.515]  So, we can all agree with each other that free speech is important.
[00:48:35.515 --> 00:48:41.260]  Unless you're Mayor Koch, who I had on a few weeks ago, who admitted they banned most free speech in Europe and was saying it was a good thing.
[00:48:44.025 --> 00:48:50.667]  Claiming the people want that.
[00:48:50.667 --> 00:48:54.007]  Incidentally, that's up on PrisonPlanet.tv, that interview.
[00:48:54.007 --> 00:49:00.189]  We took every claim he made, and where he said we were liars, and we put multiple mainstream news articles right over it where it's admitted.
[00:49:00.189 --> 00:49:01.689]  And somebody says, what do you mean you use mainstream news?
[00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:03.009]  I thought they lie.
[00:49:03.009 --> 00:49:06.970]  No, most of the time they say, oh, isn't it wonderful?
[00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:11.291]  There's a government push to make all babies have microchips in their belly buttons.
[00:49:11.291 --> 00:49:13.452]  But don't worry, it'll fall off two weeks later.
[00:49:14.844 --> 00:49:18.887]  Or, oh, isn't it great the face scanning cameras are everywhere tracking you for your safety?
[00:49:18.887 --> 00:49:25.532]  And I take that and say, no, it's a bad idea, here's why.
[00:49:25.532 --> 00:49:31.296]  Most of the time they're telling the truth, they're just putting a disgusting spin on it.
[00:49:31.296 --> 00:49:38.802]  Now, other times they flat out lie and say, Iran is running Al-Qaeda, they have rocketed the Green Zone, General Petraeus.
[00:49:43.086 --> 00:49:50.768]  When Iran is Shiite, not Wahhabist.
[00:49:50.768 --> 00:49:56.369]  And I know you know that, but finally, Oberman finally talked about it a few nights ago.
[00:49:56.369 --> 00:49:59.890]  We got that coming up after the Ventura clip I'm going to play.
[00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:08.412]  And so it's finally, the public's finally going, oh, Iran's at war with Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:08.412 --> 00:50:09.752]  Meanwhile, Betrayus, Bush,
[00:50:14.193 --> 00:50:17.095]  McCain.
[00:50:17.095 --> 00:50:20.117]  Lieberman in the past has said they're backing Al Qaeda.
[00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:21.758]  Though now they know the jig's up.
[00:50:21.758 --> 00:50:24.340]  Oh, the cattle know now we're lying.
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:25.781]  We better quit saying that.
[00:50:25.781 --> 00:50:28.183]  It's now backfiring on us.
[00:50:28.183 --> 00:50:34.307]  Now, with certain subgroups, they still say I ran as Al Qaeda on neocon fake conservative talk radio.
[00:50:34.307 --> 00:50:38.150]  So there's how they're going after the web, and it's up to you to fight it.
[00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:39.211]  I'm powerless without you.
[00:50:40.465 --> 00:50:44.211]  And, uh, they're not gonna just let this show and other shows continue to grow exponentially.
[00:50:44.211 --> 00:50:45.112]  They're moving against us.
[00:50:45.112 --> 00:50:53.163]  So even if we disagree with each other on facets of the New World Order, we need to team up together against the New World Order for free speech.
[00:50:55.044 --> 00:51:03.752]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:51:03.752 --> 00:51:09.737]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.

[00:51:20.247 --> 00:51:22.668]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:51:54.498 --> 00:51:56.499]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:51:56.499 --> 00:52:00.121]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:52:00.121 --> 00:52:02.262]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:52:02.262 --> 00:52:05.644]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:52:05.644 --> 00:52:11.427]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:52:11.427 --> 00:52:15.369]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:52:15.709 --> 00:52:20.914]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:52:20.914 --> 00:52:23.997]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.002]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:52:53.002 --> 00:52:54.863]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:52:54.863 --> 00:52:55.323]  Fact.
[00:52:55.323 --> 00:53:01.208]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:53:01.348 --> 00:53:05.710]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:13.414]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:53:13.414 --> 00:53:14.194]  The solution?
[00:53:14.194 --> 00:53:18.156]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:53:18.396 --> 00:53:27.544]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[00:53:27.544 --> 00:53:35.751]  Detoxification works with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[00:53:35.751 --> 00:53:40.275]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[00:53:40.555 --> 00:53:40.935]  It's one life!

[00:54:12.346 --> 00:54:16.388]  For life, I'm gonna live it up!
[00:54:16.388 --> 00:54:19.750]  I'm taking flight, I said I'll never give it up!
[00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:22.691]  It seems so!
[00:54:22.691 --> 00:54:31.876]  I'll be going kind of proud!
[00:54:31.876 --> 00:54:38.760]  I'm on the top of this law!
[00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:58.347]  Listen up!
[00:54:58.347 --> 00:55:03.170]  Let's go ahead and go to Jesse Ventura last night on the Daily Show.
[00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:04.791]  Very powerful information.
[00:55:06.701 --> 00:55:08.202]  Yeah, he's put his finger to the wind.
[00:55:08.202 --> 00:55:12.363]  He can feel the rebellion surging, the resistance to the New World Order.
[00:55:12.363 --> 00:55:12.863]  Here it is.
[00:55:12.863 --> 00:55:19.705]  My guest tonight is a former professional wrestler.
[00:55:19.705 --> 00:55:23.167]  And I might just pick up my chair and hit him over the head with it.
[00:55:23.167 --> 00:55:26.168]  Please welcome Jesse Ventura!
[00:55:26.168 --> 00:55:28.488]  To be clear, we also have him on the Daily Show.
[00:55:28.488 --> 00:55:29.989]  This is the Colbert Report.
[00:55:29.989 --> 00:55:30.269]  Go ahead.
[00:55:39.582 --> 00:55:40.043]  You ready?
[00:55:40.043 --> 00:55:41.045]  I'm ready.
[00:55:41.045 --> 00:55:41.766]  You ready for this?
[00:55:41.766 --> 00:55:42.327]  I'm ready.
[00:55:42.327 --> 00:55:43.689]  Let's throw down!
[00:55:43.689 --> 00:55:44.230]  I'm ready.
[00:55:46.294 --> 00:55:47.274]  Welcome to come on the show.
[00:55:47.274 --> 00:55:49.035]  Thank you.
[00:55:49.035 --> 00:55:52.636]  It's a pleasure to have an author of your stature on the show.
[00:55:52.636 --> 00:55:56.857]  You have a new book, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[00:55:56.857 --> 00:55:57.377]  That's right.
[00:55:57.377 --> 00:55:58.598]  Okay.
[00:55:58.598 --> 00:56:01.539]  Why shouldn't we start the revolution without you?
[00:56:01.539 --> 00:56:09.361]  Isn't the nature of the revolution, you gotta go when you gotta go, and we can't worry if Jesse Ventura's got his revolution uniform on yet?
[00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:10.241]  I agree.
[00:56:10.241 --> 00:56:10.962]  You agree?
[00:56:10.962 --> 00:56:13.382]  I hope everybody does start it without me.
[00:56:13.382 --> 00:56:15.363]  I can stay in Mexico and keep surfing.
[00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:17.671]  Now let me ask you something.
[00:56:17.671 --> 00:56:20.154]  What is this revolution you're talking about, sir?
[00:56:20.154 --> 00:56:22.216]  Revolution against the United States government?
[00:56:22.216 --> 00:56:23.718]  That is sedition, sir.
[00:56:23.718 --> 00:56:27.823]  And you can be thrown in... Jail would be a good thing these days.
[00:56:27.823 --> 00:56:30.086]  You could be thrown into a pit with snakes.
[00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:30.286]  Well...
[00:56:31.407 --> 00:56:35.991]  That may be true, but remember the Second Amendment with the right to bear arms?
[00:56:35.991 --> 00:56:38.453]  Well, that's not done for hunting or fishing.
[00:56:38.453 --> 00:56:45.298]  Our forefathers put that right in there so that we have the ability to rise up if our country becomes oppressive.
[00:56:45.298 --> 00:56:46.980]  So how can they have it both ways, Stephen?
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:52.904]  But that only applies in the United States, and you've already bugged out of the United States and you're living in Mexico, Jesse!
[00:56:52.904 --> 00:56:54.906]  You've given up on the United States!
[00:56:54.906 --> 00:56:55.586]  No, I've not.
[00:56:55.586 --> 00:56:59.830]  That's where you go to learn about revolution, so that you can bring it back home.
[00:57:03.174 --> 00:57:07.071]  You know, everyone thinks Che Guevara is dead.
[00:57:07.071 --> 00:57:07.694]  I know better.
[00:57:09.258 --> 00:57:11.139]  Now, is he a lucador?
[00:57:11.139 --> 00:57:14.460]  Is he one of those Mexican guys wearing a mask in the wrestling ring?
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.600]  No, I don't think so.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.221]  That's called lucha libre.
[00:57:18.221 --> 00:57:32.305]  You, um, for years, I'm just, let's get your bona fides out here, why people should listen to you, because I'm not exactly sure whether we should take advice from you, because you had, for years, what many people consider kind of a fake job, where people cheer and everything, but it's not real.
[00:57:32.305 --> 00:57:33.665]  You were the governor of Minnesota.
[00:57:33.665 --> 00:57:34.325]  Yeah.
[00:57:37.567 --> 00:57:40.269]  I also, Steven, had a fake job called a U.S.
[00:57:40.269 --> 00:57:42.912]  Navy SEAL.
[00:57:42.912 --> 00:57:43.952]  Yeah.
[00:57:43.952 --> 00:57:45.414]  And that can get fatal quick.
[00:57:45.414 --> 00:57:45.814]  Uh-huh.
[00:57:45.814 --> 00:57:46.835]  You see me shake?
[00:57:46.835 --> 00:57:49.717]  You can cut a diamond on that thing, my friend.
[00:57:49.717 --> 00:57:53.020]  Take more than a Navy SEAL to make me poop my pants.
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:54.641]  That's right, Steven.
[00:57:54.641 --> 00:57:57.624]  But always remember, you gotta sleep sometimes.
[00:58:00.484 --> 00:58:03.805]  You think the government lies to us all the time, okay?
[00:58:03.805 --> 00:58:07.047]  Well, I think that they not all the time, but they certainly do lie to us.
[00:58:07.047 --> 00:58:07.707]  Hold it there.
[00:58:07.707 --> 00:58:08.347]  This is good.
[00:58:08.347 --> 00:58:09.948]  We're going to come back, play the rest of this.
[00:58:09.948 --> 00:58:19.072]  I'm going to comment on it, on the Revolution comments, his statements, and then I'm going to get into the other news here in front of me.
[00:58:19.072 --> 00:58:20.132]  Secret plans for U.S.
[00:58:20.132 --> 00:58:21.673]  troops to stay in Iraq.
[00:58:21.673 --> 00:58:24.594]  Homeland spy satellite ignores the Constitution.
[00:58:24.594 --> 00:58:27.135]  Foreign banks flee Spanish property debt.
[00:58:28.001 --> 00:58:30.063]  Al Qaeda claims rocket attacks on U.S.
[00:58:30.063 --> 00:58:31.624]  oil men in Yemen.
[00:58:31.624 --> 00:58:36.408]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:36.408 --> 00:58:39.911]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:46.777 --> 00:58:49.619]  A new world order.
[00:58:49.619 --> 00:58:50.540]  In the near future.
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:54.501]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:54.501 --> 00:58:57.323]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:57.323 --> 00:59:00.104]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:59:00.104 --> 00:59:03.285]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:03.285 --> 00:59:10.608]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:13.655 --> 00:59:19.081]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:19.081 --> 00:59:22.965]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.965 --> 00:59:25.528]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:25.528 --> 00:59:26.709]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:26.709 --> 00:59:27.490]  They're not after money.
[00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:28.751]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:28.751 --> 00:59:29.752]  They're after power.
[00:59:29.752 --> 00:59:30.893]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.361]  Endgame.
[00:59:40.361 --> 00:59:42.382]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:42.382 --> 00:59:47.625]  You have been warned.
[00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:50.026]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:50.026 --> 00:59:52.788]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:58.797 --> 01:00:00.539]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.539 --> 01:00:02.121]  You want answers?
[01:00:02.121 --> 01:00:03.682]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.682 --> 01:00:07.887]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.887 --> 01:00:14.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.955 --> 01:00:18.699]  We are now into the second hour of worldwide transmission.
[01:00:19.631 --> 01:00:22.433]  We're going to open the phones up at the 20 after.
[01:00:22.433 --> 01:00:24.354]  A toll-free number to join us.
[01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.935]  First-time callers go to the head of the line.
[01:00:25.935 --> 01:00:28.996]  If you disagree with me, you even trump first-time callers.
[01:00:28.996 --> 01:00:30.517]  But other than that, we don't screen your calls.
[01:00:30.517 --> 01:00:31.098]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:31.098 --> 01:00:31.198]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:31.198 --> 01:00:35.080]  Let's go ahead and finish up with the Colbert Report with Jesse Ventura on it.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.300]  Last night, here it is.
[01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.833]  You think the government lies to us all the time, okay?
[01:00:51.833 --> 01:00:55.396]  Well, I think that they not all the time, but they certainly do lie to us.
[01:00:55.396 --> 01:00:56.557]  Name one lie.
[01:00:56.557 --> 01:00:57.057]  One lie.
[01:00:57.057 --> 01:00:58.398]  The Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[01:00:58.398 --> 01:00:58.999]  Name two.
[01:00:58.999 --> 01:00:59.819]  Name two lies.
[01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:01.441]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[01:01:01.441 --> 01:01:02.642]  Okay, name three lies.
[01:01:02.642 --> 01:01:03.583]  Three lies.
[01:01:03.583 --> 01:01:04.784]  Total three lies.
[01:01:04.784 --> 01:01:06.205]  Ties to Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:06.205 --> 01:01:09.908]  Okay, I bet you couldn't name four.
[01:01:09.908 --> 01:01:11.889]  Oh, you got me there.
[01:01:11.889 --> 01:01:12.730]  Okay, see?
[01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:14.231]  I'm torn your argument apart completely.
[01:01:14.231 --> 01:01:16.053]  Three is all that I can get, but you know what?
[01:01:16.053 --> 01:01:17.334]  Three strikes and you're out.
[01:01:19.591 --> 01:01:22.512]  What do they play in Mexico?
[01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:23.592]  Baseball, like we do here.
[01:01:23.592 --> 01:01:23.873]  Baseball?
[01:01:23.873 --> 01:01:24.973]  What do they call it there?
[01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:26.794]  Baseball.
[01:01:26.794 --> 01:01:28.214]  So I guess I do speak Spanish.
[01:01:28.214 --> 01:01:29.975]  There you go.
[01:01:29.975 --> 01:01:32.756]  Now, you say you've got something wrong with the two-party system.
[01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:33.216]  I agree.
[01:01:33.216 --> 01:01:33.656]  Yeah.
[01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:35.917]  Okay, that's one party too many.
[01:01:35.917 --> 01:01:36.597]  Why?
[01:01:36.597 --> 01:01:38.538]  What's your problem with the two-party system?
[01:01:38.538 --> 01:01:43.159]  Well, my problem with the two-party system is that it's not a party with only two.
[01:01:43.159 --> 01:01:45.160]  You gotta have more than two people to have a party.
[01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:48.178]  Well, I mean, the Republican Party is a big tent.
[01:01:48.178 --> 01:01:49.900]  A lot of people are in the Republican Party.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:52.642]  I mean, it's got a very broad base.
[01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:56.866]  You've got, like, Ron Paul, who's the crazy coot candidate.
[01:01:56.866 --> 01:02:02.551]  And then you've got Dick Cheney, who is the candidate of the mole people.
[01:02:02.551 --> 01:02:04.392]  Totally, totally different groups of people.
[01:02:04.392 --> 01:02:05.954]  I have another name for Dick Cheney.
[01:02:05.954 --> 01:02:07.175]  He's called the Chicken Hawk.
[01:02:10.641 --> 01:02:14.924]  I think that means he picks up teenage gay prostitutes.
[01:02:14.924 --> 01:02:15.625]  No.
[01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:16.185]  No.
[01:02:16.185 --> 01:02:20.548]  What it means is when it was his time to go to war during Vietnam, he was chicken.
[01:02:20.548 --> 01:02:22.490]  He had a student deferment, sir.
[01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:23.671]  He had to... Four of them.
[01:02:23.671 --> 01:02:25.052]  Five, actually.
[01:02:25.052 --> 01:02:25.592]  Five?
[01:02:25.592 --> 01:02:26.773]  I lost count.
[01:02:26.773 --> 01:02:29.935]  He had to... I mean, he was... Wait a minute, though.
[01:02:29.935 --> 01:02:31.296]  College, post-college... Wait, wait, wait.
[01:02:31.296 --> 01:02:34.458]  When we go to war, shouldn't we have the best and the brightest?
[01:02:34.458 --> 01:02:34.879]  Right.
[01:02:34.879 --> 01:02:37.080]  Back in Washington, telling the other people where to go.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.902]  Why do you get a student deferment, then?
[01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:42.544]  So he could be bester and brighter.
[01:02:42.544 --> 01:02:43.845]  That's why we needed him.
[01:02:43.845 --> 01:02:47.888]  Like George Bush said, the only problem with Vietnam was we left too soon.
[01:02:47.888 --> 01:02:51.330]  Well, why didn't those two come over and help out?
[01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:54.933]  Now, George Bush was with the Alabama National Guard.
[01:02:54.933 --> 01:02:55.793]  No, the Texas.
[01:02:55.793 --> 01:02:58.955]  He was guarding Dallas from the North Vietnamese Air Force.
[01:02:58.955 --> 01:03:03.038]  But he was sent to Alabama and they couldn't find him there.
[01:03:03.038 --> 01:03:04.139]  And I think, you know what?
[01:03:04.139 --> 01:03:07.121]  I think he was on missions in Vietnam that whole time.
[01:03:07.121 --> 01:03:08.121]  He's too humble to talk about it.
[01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:08.522]  No, no, no.
[01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:14.015]  He was enrolling in Harvard Business School and he never reported for duty.
[01:03:14.015 --> 01:03:16.155]  That's called unauthorized absence.
[01:03:16.155 --> 01:03:17.036]  Let me ask you something.
[01:03:17.036 --> 01:03:20.597]  If I were to put together an Iraqi task force, who should I have on it?
[01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:23.838]  You or Sergeant Slaughter?
[01:03:23.838 --> 01:03:26.579]  Because you both are very strong, very strong on defense.
[01:03:26.579 --> 01:03:27.880]  Well, that would depend.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.761]  Do you want a real veteran or a fraudulent one?
[01:03:31.761 --> 01:03:34.262]  I'll take the one that inspires the crowd the most.
[01:03:35.294 --> 01:03:36.755]  Well... He's a crowd pleaser.
[01:03:36.755 --> 01:03:37.675]  That's Sergeant Slaughter.
[01:03:37.675 --> 01:03:39.195]  Yeah, and I was a villain.
[01:03:39.195 --> 01:03:40.956]  I was a crowd displeaser.
[01:03:40.956 --> 01:03:42.336]  So I guess I'd have to go with him.
[01:03:42.336 --> 01:03:43.097]  Nah.
[01:03:43.097 --> 01:03:43.497]  No?
[01:03:43.497 --> 01:03:48.999]  When it comes time to war, you want the displeaser, not the pleaser.
[01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:51.379]  Jesse Ventura, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:03:51.379 --> 01:03:55.581]  The book is Don't Start the Revolution Without Me!
[01:03:55.581 --> 01:03:57.361]  Jesse Ventura!
[01:03:57.361 --> 01:04:01.363]  And we need you, Stephen Colbert, to start the revolution.
[01:04:01.363 --> 01:04:02.023]  I have a bum knee.
[01:04:05.407 --> 01:04:07.048]  I have a bum knee.
[01:04:07.048 --> 01:04:11.109]  Playing the part of a neocon sniveler.
[01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:17.092]  Yeah, there's Ventura talking about our right to defend ourselves against tyranny.
[01:04:17.092 --> 01:04:21.634]  Have you read the preamble to the Bill of Rights?
[01:04:21.634 --> 01:04:23.255]  Most people don't even know there's a preamble to it.
[01:04:23.255 --> 01:04:23.935]  Go read it.
[01:04:23.935 --> 01:04:28.016]  It says the same thing the Declaration of Independence says, basically.
[01:04:28.016 --> 01:04:30.417]  We all should reread the Declaration of Independence.
[01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:32.418]  Maybe I'll do that in the fourth hour today.
[01:04:32.418 --> 01:04:33.819]  Read part of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:40.429]  And ask yourself, that long train of abuses is not the same thing we see today.
[01:04:40.429 --> 01:04:41.872]  And Ventura's answer was correct.
[01:04:41.872 --> 01:04:44.756]  If they're trying to put you in a death camp, then you physically fight back.
[01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:47.942]  That's the only time I'm for physical fighting, though.
[01:04:47.942 --> 01:04:48.583]  It's defensive.
[01:04:51.815 --> 01:04:53.776]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:04:53.776 --> 01:05:00.738]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:05:00.738 --> 01:05:09.141]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:07:11.974 --> 01:07:12.274]  I'm good.
[01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:28.930]  Big Brother!
[01:07:57.268 --> 01:07:59.030]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:00.791]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:02.372]  You want answers?
[01:08:02.372 --> 01:08:03.293]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:03.293 --> 01:08:08.137]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.137 --> 01:08:14.302]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:14.302 --> 01:08:20.067]  Jesse Ventura was right to say that revolution is brewing in Mexico.
[01:08:20.067 --> 01:08:25.632]  Unfortunately, it is a leftist revolution, which is part of the same control arm of the International Bank's
[01:08:26.892 --> 01:08:30.715]  They've been proven to have set it all up and control almost every facet of it.
[01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:39.921]  There are a few communist revolutions that they do not control, but those are always shut down rather quickly.
[01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:52.149]  But if you look at our experience here in this nation, for decades the British government was oppressive to its subjects and had double standards.
[01:08:53.201 --> 01:08:59.845]  There was more and more liberty being demanded in England at the very same time.
[01:08:59.845 --> 01:09:07.170]  There was a great awakening for freedom, and so the colonists actually had almost half of the parliamentary support.
[01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:18.777]  In fact, they had more than that until King George III rode down in a parade and spoke to Parliament, which was unprecedented, and told them they were basically treasonous to the crown if they didn't vote for the war.
[01:09:18.777 --> 01:09:21.999]  So that's another reason the British finally lost, was because they didn't have support
[01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:27.795]  At home, eight, nine years into the conflict.
[01:09:27.795 --> 01:09:33.728]  But it started when the Redcoats went into Lexington and Concord to confiscate the firearms.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:53.388]  That's why it's asinine, the controlled corporate press claiming that we didn't own guns in the colonies, and that most people didn't have guns, and they were caught putting out fake textbooks, the University of Chicago did, with fake letters and fake church records that no one owned guns, you know, that 2% did.
[01:09:53.388 --> 01:09:57.950]  Turned out it was all fake, all lies, just totally made up.
[01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:02.132]  Everybody owned guns, it was a frontier nation, we just had massive wars with the French.
[01:10:03.388 --> 01:10:09.790]  Wars with the natives.
[01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:17.792]  And so, that's the reality of how this nation started, and I don't want a revolution to start.
[01:10:17.792 --> 01:10:19.833]  I don't want a violent revolution to start, that is.
[01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:28.916]  I don't want people to be shooting and killing each other in the streets, and cops to be getting killed, and foreign troops to be brought in, which they've publicly announced they'll do and have already set up.
[01:10:28.916 --> 01:10:30.176]  The unbelievable is happening.
[01:10:32.219 --> 01:10:33.240]  I don't want that to happen.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:41.326]  It's like they brought German mercenaries in and others during the war against the Crown.
[01:10:41.326 --> 01:10:44.209]  The Crown brought those in against the colonists.
[01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:45.190]  I don't want that to happen.
[01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:46.811]  I mean, we really are in dangerous times.
[01:10:46.811 --> 01:10:48.452]  We're in insane times.
[01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:50.474]  The establishment really has built FEMA camps.
[01:10:50.474 --> 01:10:54.417]  They really are trying to sell the public on being arrested and put in camps.
[01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:57.740]  They're putting up trial balloons announcing it.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:59.001]  It's now being openly debated.
[01:11:00.268 --> 01:11:01.649]  I don't want this to happen.
[01:11:01.649 --> 01:11:06.954]  I don't want this to develop.
[01:11:06.954 --> 01:11:18.484]  Let's go ahead and play a little clip of Oberman and his countdown show, talking about something that we've been talking about for the last four years.
[01:11:18.484 --> 01:11:23.449]  The war is now five-plus years old.
[01:11:23.449 --> 01:11:24.870]  But there's a little bit of spin here.
[01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:26.772]  We'll comment on that after we play it.
[01:11:27.979 --> 01:11:28.479]  Good evening.
[01:11:28.479 --> 01:11:34.663]  The maxim, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, is believed, ironically in this context, to be an old Arabic proverb.
[01:11:34.663 --> 01:11:36.204]  Now we're fifth story on the countdown.
[01:11:36.204 --> 01:11:43.908]  The problem is, especially in a world evidently too complicated for the Bush administration, sometimes the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy.
[01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:49.851]  The same president who famously declared little more than five years ago that you are either with us or you are against us in the war on terror.
[01:11:50.351 --> 01:12:01.940]  Is now reported to be secretly funding jihadists linked with Al Qaeda in an attempt to stem the growth of Shiite influence across the Middle East and influence the administration itself magnified by invading Iraq.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:03.761]  Yes, Al Qaeda as in 9-11.
[01:12:05.106 --> 01:12:11.850]  Vice President Cheney today making a surprise visit to President Musharraf of Pakistan, delivering what officials say was a tough message.
[01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:16.713]  To shut down the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in that country, or risk losing U.S.
[01:12:16.713 --> 01:12:16.933]  aid.
[01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:25.819]  More specifically, the Vice President saying that the newly elected Democratic Congress could cut the aid unless Pakistani forces became far more aggressive.
[01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:33.463]  One presumes Mr. Musharraf remembered Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush still believe they have some measure of control over American foreign policy, say about 150%.
[01:12:34.764 --> 01:12:36.425]  So I say Oberman finally covers it.
[01:12:36.425 --> 01:12:42.709]  This is from a year ago, but it's much worse than that.
[01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:48.713]  It's the actual number three of Al-Qaeda that has been commanding the forces for more than four years.
[01:12:48.713 --> 01:12:50.534]  I keep saying four years.
[01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:58.879]  We learned about this about eight months into the invasion and takeover when Iraq was firmly in the paws and the grasp of the neocons.
[01:13:07.876 --> 01:13:13.859]  So, they then kind of spin it like, well, they're just working with some people connected to Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:13.859 --> 01:13:15.961]  No, this is actual Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:15.961 --> 01:13:18.962]  But why didn't Oberman go further into that?
[01:13:18.962 --> 01:13:36.452]  Why didn't he talk about how in 1979, six months before the Russians invaded Afghanistan, how the CIA gave them hundreds of millions of dollars of funding to actually attack the Russians.
[01:13:37.952 --> 01:13:46.196]  Which precipitated the Russians coming in to defend their minions who begged for them to come in and save them.
[01:13:46.196 --> 01:13:48.077]  Inside Afghanistan.
[01:13:48.077 --> 01:13:54.540]  But the people running the U.S., and I don't want to say the U.S., because we're always in the psychology of it's us.
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.121]  No, we're being used here.
[01:13:57.121 --> 01:13:58.962]  Why doesn't Oberman want to talk about that?
[01:13:58.962 --> 01:14:06.766]  I guess he doesn't want to discuss that because it would talk bad about Jimmy Carter, and it's important to keep this in the left-right paradigm of
[01:14:07.935 --> 01:14:12.117]  Republicans monsters, Democrats good.
[01:14:12.117 --> 01:14:25.465]  That's why Oberman has admitted that he's strongly considering taking a football and baseball announcer's job, he's been offered a bunch of them, and leaving television news entirely.
[01:14:25.465 --> 01:14:26.885]  In the past, that was his job.
[01:14:26.885 --> 01:14:28.686]  He called football and baseball games.
[01:14:28.686 --> 01:14:30.227]  By the way, I'd seen some of the games he called.
[01:14:30.227 --> 01:14:31.608]  He's excellent.
[01:14:31.608 --> 01:14:35.870]  Back in the day when I had time to watch such things, 15 years ago.
[01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:36.811]  But Keith Oberman
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:47.284]  Admits that, well, he won't have anything to do once the Democrats are in, because I guess he thinks everything's going to be fine.
[01:14:47.284 --> 01:14:53.367]  The military-industrial complex is owned by the private banks that own the defense contractors, and own Big Pharma.
[01:14:53.367 --> 01:14:57.829]  And they're going to continue every single agenda under Hillary or Barack Obama if they get into office.
[01:14:58.928 --> 01:15:02.150]  They will continue the exact same agenda if John McCain gets in.
[01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:06.012]  So people are calling me and emailing me saying, Alex, why aren't you talking about John McCain?
[01:15:06.012 --> 01:15:12.395]  Why aren't you talking about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or the dirt in all of their closets?
[01:15:12.395 --> 01:15:13.295]  What is the point?
[01:15:13.295 --> 01:15:14.116]  They're all bad.
[01:15:14.116 --> 01:15:16.717]  They're all owned by the same people.
[01:15:16.717 --> 01:15:20.059]  And it's a distraction to even give credence to it.
[01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:29.675]  The only candidate that had any difference in the Democratic ilk was Dennis Kucinich, and I don't agree with him on gun control and a bunch of other issues.
[01:15:29.675 --> 01:15:42.625]  And the only candidate that I did agree with on 99% of the issues, and who I respect and like, is Ron Paul, and they cheated him and blocked him and demonized him and... He had a shot at the presidency in a fair system, but it's rigged!
[01:15:44.838 --> 01:15:52.582]  So I don't blame people that want to go take over the delegates and then vote for Ron Paul at the convention and put him in as president.
[01:15:52.582 --> 01:15:57.245]  It's just politically, that'll be political suicide.
[01:15:57.245 --> 01:16:08.171]  I'm all for you going in with the delegates and taking over the party platform at the state and federal level, and for you causing a big stink and bringing up real issues at the convention.
[01:16:08.171 --> 01:16:10.452]  I've said I'm for that.
[01:16:10.452 --> 01:16:14.314]  And then some, I was sent a clip the other night of somebody saying I was against any of it.
[01:16:15.678 --> 01:16:21.101]  I love how people that always attack me never attack me on what I really say or do.
[01:16:21.101 --> 01:16:28.664]  They always attack me on some strawman facsimile of what I say or do.
[01:16:28.664 --> 01:16:33.606]  I was thinking about those that criticized me about, quote, giving Israel a pass.
[01:16:33.606 --> 01:16:36.628]  My last two films.
[01:16:36.628 --> 01:16:39.289]  Terror Storm exposes Israel for staging the attack on the U.S.'
[01:16:39.269 --> 01:16:41.430]  's liberty to blame it on Egypt.
[01:16:41.954 --> 01:16:51.058]  But because most Liberty Survivors I've had on know, and the admirals I've had on, and the people that are now deceased like Admiral Moore, those interviews are there, believe that LBJ knew and was involved in it.
[01:16:51.058 --> 01:16:53.139]  That doesn't give Israel a pass.
[01:16:53.139 --> 01:16:58.582]  It shows that our government was involved, showing the collusion.
[01:16:58.582 --> 01:16:59.943]  All we do is try to report the truth.
[01:16:59.943 --> 01:17:01.403]  Our job's easy.
[01:17:01.403 --> 01:17:06.666]  Or then the last film I made about how Israel, the white-skinned European Jews,
[01:17:07.597 --> 01:17:21.481]  Target, and Tex Mars told me about this about a decade ago and showed me some documents, but I learned about the ringworm children, how they radiated 110,000 Jewish Sephardic children, the brown-skinned children from North Africa and Spain and other areas.
[01:17:21.481 --> 01:17:26.783]  And in Iraq, when they invited them in, they took them and radiated them and killed a lot of them and maimed the rest.
[01:17:26.783 --> 01:17:34.985]  You know, I have the ADL attacking me over that stuff, but the COINTELPRO doesn't care.
[01:17:36.033 --> 01:17:37.494]  They have to demonize me.
[01:17:37.494 --> 01:17:49.660]  They have to make people think that I am not exposing things because this message is so effective and so dynamic and wakes up so many people that they're scared to death of this show.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:57.063]  Then there's well-meaning people who buy into the COINTELPRO propaganda, and I wish I could reach out to them, but you can't really do it.
[01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:59.345]  Most of them.
[01:17:59.345 --> 01:18:02.226]  Because I know a lot of these people mean well, and you just
[01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:08.094]  Most of them I've tried to really analyze, and it's just they're too far gone.
[01:18:08.094 --> 01:18:09.815]  They can't be reached out to.
[01:18:09.815 --> 01:18:11.476]  They can't see the big picture.
[01:18:11.476 --> 01:18:28.264]  They can't read Labor-Zionist documents where they help put Hitler in power, and then made a deal with Hitler not to let Jews leave anywhere but Israel, and then made Jewish families pay million-dollar ransoms at the time, on average, to get their families out.
[01:18:28.264 --> 01:18:30.165]  Very sick!
[01:18:30.165 --> 01:18:33.467]  You see, I'm against Hitler, and I'm against the Zionists.
[01:18:34.369 --> 01:18:37.853]  And I talk about that.
[01:18:37.853 --> 01:18:44.521]  But then I understand most people who think that they're a Zionist, there's really three different camps, and they don't understand what they're a part of.
[01:18:44.521 --> 01:18:54.012]  Just like, I don't like having to come up here and talk about how probably more than half the Mexicans in Mexico want Larry Conquista and the plan of San Diego to kill all whites, 16 and older.
[01:18:55.282 --> 01:19:00.525]  And I know that even talking about it probably compacts them more into their tribal society.
[01:19:00.525 --> 01:19:01.946]  We're all in tribal societies.
[01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:13.714]  It's like when I bash cops out of primitiveness myself, it probably helps the New World Order because that compacts the cops more into their thin blue lines culture instead of reaching out to them explaining how they've been used.
[01:19:15.779 --> 01:19:25.023]  You know, I've begged the people that are always attacking Israel to, hey, why don't you hit on how the Zionists worked with Hitler?
[01:19:25.023 --> 01:19:27.984]  Well, no, I'm not going to get into that.
[01:19:27.984 --> 01:19:30.425]  Hitler wasn't too bad.
[01:19:30.425 --> 01:19:32.146]  No, Hitler was bad.
[01:19:32.146 --> 01:19:34.587]  So see, this is more sophisticated.
[01:19:34.587 --> 01:19:36.128]  This stuff is very sophisticated.
[01:19:38.081 --> 01:19:42.245]  It's like we expose the fact that the Pope calls for a New World Order, and that it's working for the New World Order.
[01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:44.487]  It isn't enough for the Catholics to do it, all people.
[01:19:44.487 --> 01:19:47.429]  They've gotta make it about their weird little niche.
[01:19:47.429 --> 01:19:51.753]  And that's what holds them back from really reaching out and waking a lot of people up.
[01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.174]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:53.174 --> 01:19:56.017]  A New World Order.
[01:19:56.017 --> 01:19:56.898]  In the near future.
[01:19:57.805 --> 01:20:00.866]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:00.866 --> 01:20:03.708]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:03.708 --> 01:20:06.509]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:06.509 --> 01:20:09.690]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:17.014]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:20.046 --> 01:20:25.469]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:25.469 --> 01:20:29.331]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:29.331 --> 01:20:31.912]  The old America's making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:31.912 --> 01:20:33.073]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:33.073 --> 01:20:33.853]  They're not after money.
[01:20:33.853 --> 01:20:35.134]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:35.134 --> 01:20:36.134]  They're after power.
[01:20:36.134 --> 01:20:37.275]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:20:46.768 --> 01:20:48.793]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:20:48.793 --> 01:20:49.955]  You have been warned.
[01:20:52.062 --> 01:20:58.147]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:20:58.147 --> 01:21:04.092]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:08.255]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:21:08.255 --> 01:21:13.419]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:21:13.419 --> 01:21:20.925]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[01:22:59.816 --> 01:23:04.961]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.

[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:11.262]  Harry, Jason, Jason, John, Kevin, many others, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:25:11.262 --> 01:25:14.985]  Let me go ahead and get into some other news now.
[01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:16.426]  Secret plans for U.S.
[01:25:16.426 --> 01:25:18.127]  troops to stay in Iraq.
[01:25:18.127 --> 01:25:19.628]  That's the London Telegraph today.
[01:25:19.628 --> 01:25:20.389]  Now, again,
[01:25:21.448 --> 01:25:29.642]  Remember that before the war, a year before the war, I went on air and we read the 1986...
[01:25:37.868 --> 01:25:40.269]  ...that they would use and lobby the U.S.
[01:25:40.269 --> 01:25:43.511]  to invade Iraq, and this is when the U.S.
[01:25:43.511 --> 01:25:54.738]  was running Iraq, basically, and big buddies with Saddam, and funding him to attack Iran, and giving him even the nerve gas, and the CIA advisors, and the weather reports of where to spray it, how to spray it, how to use it.
[01:25:54.738 --> 01:26:03.483]  Because Saddam was starting to lose, and, uh... Iranians were using primitive
[01:26:07.023 --> 01:26:20.195]  Cyanide gas in rocket attacks and mortar attacks, artillery attacks to be precise, against the more heavily armed but outnumbered Iraqis.
[01:26:20.195 --> 01:26:23.498]  This is all mainstream history, you can go look it up for yourself.
[01:26:23.498 --> 01:26:32.667]  So while they were busy, they took him when he was 18 in 58, 48 excuse me, trained him as a CIA assassin, he killed a bunch of people, wounded the president,
[01:26:33.197 --> 01:26:36.620]  Then they told the Ba'athists in 68, put him in as the head of security, let the U.S.
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:46.147]  run things, put our apparatchik in, our apparatus in, and we will protect you.
[01:26:46.147 --> 01:26:50.651]  And then they staged a coup in 79 and fully took over.
[01:26:50.651 --> 01:26:51.752]  And so basically the U.S.
[01:26:51.752 --> 01:26:54.614]  and Israel were running with the British advising.
[01:26:54.614 --> 01:26:56.216]  They had drawn the maps.
[01:26:56.216 --> 01:26:57.316]  They were the real kingmakers.
[01:26:57.316 --> 01:26:59.138]  They'd set up Israel as the set piece.
[01:27:00.369 --> 01:27:07.654]  Through the Rothschilds and others, but using British power right at the end of World War I. Again, they create these conflicts.
[01:27:07.654 --> 01:27:25.364]  And the whole time, while Saddam's our boy, they are plotting how, in the next decade, they want to create an excuse to attack Iraq, go in and kill Saddam, break the country in three to four parts, and then it's said that U.S.
[01:27:25.364 --> 01:27:27.005]  troops would be there for the next century.
[01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:41.005]  And then in the decades afterward, they would project power into Syria, Iran, link up with Afghanistan, and there you have the Project for a New American Century republished.
[01:27:41.005 --> 01:27:47.048]  In 1997, they wrote about the 62 rogue nations and how they first wanted to go into Iraq.
[01:27:47.048 --> 01:27:51.390]  So, and then they wrote a letter to Bill Clinton saying, do this, and he went ahead and bombed them, you know, followed orders.
[01:27:56.109 --> 01:28:04.535]  But then they get on television, and they lie to the public and say the troops will be back by Christmas, they'll be back in just seven, eight months, guaranteed.
[01:28:04.535 --> 01:28:14.342]  Everything's gonna be wonderful, and the first thing they do is disband the military, disband the Republican Guard, disband the government, knowing everything would disintegrate.
[01:28:14.342 --> 01:28:19.726]  Then they started funding the different rival factions to kill each other, and we told you that four years ago, and now it's come out in the news.
[01:28:22.085 --> 01:28:42.894]  To keep the conflict going, then, I predicted even before the war started, they would have it go three, four years, then stop funding the conflict for a while to make it about, first it's, oh, we can't leave, the conflict's too bad, and, oh, look, now we can't leave, we've fixed almost all the conflict, and then when you gripe, they turn the conflict back on by attacking al-Sadr two weeks ago.
[01:28:42.894 --> 01:28:48.237]  And then claim Iran is al-Qaeda and is attacking.
[01:28:48.237 --> 01:28:50.818]  I mean, it's amazing how they do, it's order out of chaos.
[01:28:52.814 --> 01:28:53.994]  Secret plans for U.S.
[01:28:53.994 --> 01:28:55.515]  troops to stay in Iraq.
[01:28:55.515 --> 01:29:07.138]  The document which was written a month ago and is marked secret and sensitive is intended to replace the United Nations mandate for coalition troops including British forces to remain in Iraq which expires at the end of the year.
[01:29:07.138 --> 01:29:09.058]  The draft authorization would allow for the U.S.
[01:29:09.058 --> 01:29:15.380]  to conduct military operations in Iraq and detain individuals when necessary for imperative reasons of security.
[01:29:15.998 --> 01:29:21.180]  We're going to finish up with this and go to your calls on the other side, right here on the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:51.331 --> 01:31:51.791]  Fact.
[01:31:51.791 --> 01:31:57.814]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:31:57.814 --> 01:32:02.176]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:32:02.176 --> 01:32:09.879]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[01:32:09.879 --> 01:32:10.659]  The solution.
[01:32:10.659 --> 01:32:14.621]  Detoxification integrated with Electro Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.

[01:33:39.804 --> 01:33:45.765]  You began to cry when you said goodbye.
[01:33:45.765 --> 01:33:47.325]  Sank into your dreams.
[01:33:47.325 --> 01:33:53.106]  Sank into your dreams.
[01:33:53.106 --> 01:33:56.567]  Poncho was a bandit boy.
[01:33:56.567 --> 01:34:00.748]  His horse was fast as polished steel.
[01:34:00.748 --> 01:34:04.648]  He wore his gun outside his pants.
[01:34:04.648 --> 01:34:07.529]  For all the honest world to feel.
[01:34:08.863 --> 01:34:19.846]  I'm going to let part of this roll and then I'm going to finish up with some of this news and go to your calls.
[01:34:19.846 --> 01:34:21.487]  Don't forget the fourth hour is coming up.
[01:34:37.455 --> 01:35:04.281]  Only let him slip away Out of kindness, I suppose Lifty, he can't sing the blues All night long, like he used to The dusty poncho bent down south Ended up and left his mouth
[01:35:05.643 --> 01:35:32.552]  The day they laid poor Pancho low Left his split for Ohio Where he got the bread to go There ain't nobody to know All the Federalists say They could have had him any day
[01:35:33.874 --> 01:35:35.967]  We only let him slip away.
[01:36:05.566 --> 01:36:08.567]  And here comes the hag!
[01:36:08.567 --> 01:36:34.758]  The boys tell how Pancho fell And left his living in a cheap hotel The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold So the story ends, we're told Pancho needs your prayers, it's true We'll save a few for a lefty tune
[01:36:36.064 --> 01:36:42.826]  He only did what he had to do.
[01:36:42.826 --> 01:36:46.287]  And now he's grown old.
[01:36:46.287 --> 01:36:50.368]  All right.
[01:36:50.368 --> 01:36:54.189]  Homeland Spy Satellite Plan ignores Constitution.
[01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:55.530]  I want to get into that in a minute.
[01:36:55.530 --> 01:36:58.130]  But first, let me cover this.
[01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:00.571]  Secret plans for US troops to stay in Iraq.
[01:37:01.684 --> 01:37:06.768]  A secret draft agreement is being drawn up to allow United States forces to remain in Iraq indefinitely.
[01:37:06.768 --> 01:37:07.629]  It has been reported.
[01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:09.870]  What a joke!
[01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:15.094]  As if the puppet president of Iraq runs even the Green Zone, which they're evacuating from.
[01:37:15.094 --> 01:37:18.977]  As if he isn't a complete and total puppet.
[01:37:18.977 --> 01:37:27.844]  The document, which was written a month ago and is marked secret and sensitive, is intended to replace the United Nations mandate for coalition troops
[01:37:28.311 --> 01:37:33.496]  Including British forces to remain in Iraq, which expires at the end of the year.
[01:37:33.496 --> 01:37:34.117]  See, U.N.
[01:37:34.117 --> 01:37:35.058]  operation.
[01:37:35.058 --> 01:37:35.738]  They're the boss.
[01:37:35.738 --> 01:37:37.881]  The draft authorization would allow for the U.S.
[01:37:37.881 --> 01:37:46.149]  to conduct military operations in Iraq and to detain individuals when necessary for imperative reasons of security.
[01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:50.673]  It does not set a time limit, but describes the arrangement as temporary and points out that U.S.
[01:37:50.673 --> 01:37:51.114]  forces
[01:37:51.854 --> 01:37:57.578]  Does not want permanent bases, that's why they're building them everywhere, or a permanent military presence in the country.
[01:37:57.578 --> 01:37:59.600]  They're just official documents, say a hundred years.
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:00.801]  It also states the U.S.
[01:38:00.801 --> 01:38:05.204]  does not seek to use Iraq as a base to launch operations against other states.
[01:38:05.204 --> 01:38:11.049]  The draft agreement is unlikely to emerge unscathed from political scrutiny in Baghdad or Washington.
[01:38:11.049 --> 01:38:13.130]  There appears little appetite in the U.S.
[01:38:13.130 --> 01:38:15.672]  for a drawn-out occupation of Iraq.
[01:38:15.672 --> 01:38:21.717]  In Baghdad, both Shia and Sunni political groups opposed to the American presence are likely to oppose the agreement if it
[01:38:22.918 --> 01:38:23.078]  Yes.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.381]  Now let's stop and talk about the facts.
[01:38:43.381 --> 01:38:45.041]  A year and a half ago, they make a truce with the Mahdi.
[01:39:08.712 --> 01:39:12.194]  Then the Iraqi government, U.S.
[01:39:12.194 --> 01:39:19.578]  controlled, slash Israel controlled forces, slash British controlled forces, attack them.
[01:39:19.578 --> 01:39:21.019]  They have a big blow up again.
[01:39:21.019 --> 01:39:38.008]  Then, they're about to have elections, and two weeks to go, the elections are coming up, two weeks to go, all over the country, in the south and up to Baghdad, there are midnight arrests, people getting drug out of their homes, assassinations, attacks on Shiite leaders.
[01:39:39.605 --> 01:39:42.967]  Leaders of the Mahdi Army.
[01:39:42.967 --> 01:39:48.289]  So, and then they go after al-Sadr and try to hit his house and some other things.
[01:39:48.289 --> 01:39:49.110]  Okay.
[01:39:49.110 --> 01:39:54.392]  So the ceasefire breaks down, they go into Basra, all this happens.
[01:39:54.392 --> 01:39:57.194]  And we said day one, this is because the elections are coming up.
[01:39:57.194 --> 01:39:57.854]  You watch.
[01:39:57.854 --> 01:40:02.497]  They're going to claim and tell everybody in the news that al-Sadr caused this.
[01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:05.118]  They're going to say he's Al-Qaeda and in league with the Easter Bunny.
[01:40:09.406 --> 01:40:10.387]  Mr. Ed the Horse.
[01:40:10.387 --> 01:40:11.827]  It doesn't matter what they tell the public here.
[01:40:11.827 --> 01:40:12.728]  They'll believe it.
[01:40:12.728 --> 01:40:15.029]  Or some of them will, at least.
[01:40:15.029 --> 01:40:20.952]  And... They're gonna either cancel or suspend the elections or not let the Shiites vote.
[01:40:20.952 --> 01:40:25.095]  Or not let Shiite candidates be there.
[01:40:25.095 --> 01:40:26.675]  And of course they have to.
[01:40:26.675 --> 01:40:31.698]  The country is majority Shiite.
[01:40:31.698 --> 01:40:34.940]  So, they don't want Shiites running the nation.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.141]  Now, let's be clear.
[01:40:36.141 --> 01:40:37.841]  There's a secular government the U.S.
[01:40:37.841 --> 01:40:38.722]  puts in with Saddam.
[01:40:40.424 --> 01:40:47.166]  Then the Israeli plan comes into fruition to take him out, you know, set him up, get him to start a war, tell him go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[01:40:47.166 --> 01:40:49.346]  April Gillespie said go ahead and do it, the U.S.
[01:40:49.346 --> 01:40:50.586]  Ambassador, we're your buddy.
[01:40:50.586 --> 01:40:52.147]  He said okay, goes in.
[01:40:52.147 --> 01:40:59.488]  They set him up, they bomb him, they bomb the place for 13 years.
[01:40:59.488 --> 01:41:01.609]  Now they've had five more years of extermination.
[01:41:01.609 --> 01:41:05.170]  There's three million dead Iraqis in the total occupation.
[01:41:05.170 --> 01:41:06.350]  That's an admitted number.
[01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:10.011]  We can debate whether it's 500,000 or a million and a half dead since
[01:41:10.673 --> 01:41:11.914]  In the last five years.
[01:41:11.914 --> 01:41:24.078]  But we know it was two plus million gone up until the latest wave of having their power plants and water treatment plants bombed and having their bridges blown out because that could be used militarily.
[01:41:24.078 --> 01:41:29.941]  And their airports bombed and their factories bombed and their chemical plants bombed.
[01:41:29.941 --> 01:41:37.704]  First world nation reduced to cholera and dysentery and having one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world.
[01:41:41.488 --> 01:41:47.753]  In deceptive 60 minutes pieces showing whole warehouses filled with dental office chairs that were bought by Saddam.
[01:41:47.753 --> 01:41:50.075]  But look, he just hoards them and says he's not given aid.
[01:41:50.075 --> 01:41:54.880]  He's not allowed any of the cabling or air pumps that go with it to run the dental chairs.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:55.900]  They're waiting for those.
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:58.923]  See, that's the type of stuff the media does.
[01:41:58.923 --> 01:41:59.363]  Look at him.
[01:41:59.363 --> 01:42:01.105]  They've got warehouses full of all this stuff.
[01:42:01.105 --> 01:42:04.007]  He's just greedy.
[01:42:04.007 --> 01:42:08.171]  They were waiting, trying to get the other parts through, smuggled in through Georgia.
[01:42:10.555 --> 01:42:24.063]  You know, through Europe, into Jordan, out of Iran, out of Turkey, through Kurdistan.
[01:42:24.063 --> 01:42:28.225]  All of this is going on.
[01:42:28.225 --> 01:42:31.127]  And they go in there, the U.S.
[01:42:31.127 --> 01:42:33.569]  tells the Shiites to rise up against Saddam.
[01:42:33.569 --> 01:42:37.451]  The truth is they wanted to weaken the Shiites because they had this whole plan set up, and that's now come out.
[01:42:38.317 --> 01:42:42.440]  Meanwhile, somehow Saddam was given, through all these generals that were trained in the U.S.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:49.065]  that were still in place with him, where all the Shiites were, and then the U.S.
[01:42:49.065 --> 01:42:53.148]  didn't give the Shiites air cover to kill them.
[01:42:53.148 --> 01:42:55.770]  The Shiites now, of course, know that.
[01:42:55.770 --> 01:43:02.775]  Now the Shiites are there, and they're watching Wahhabis, Sunnis, being put in, and with the U.S.
[01:43:02.775 --> 01:43:07.599]  backing, with in many cases matching funds, out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:12.331]  Saudi Arabia is the British darling.
[01:43:12.331 --> 01:43:14.873]  Saudi Arabia was set up by the British.
[01:43:14.873 --> 01:43:23.176]  Saudi Arabia matched the money to set up Al Qaeda to attack the Russians to precipitate the war.
[01:43:23.176 --> 01:43:30.120]  You know, I saw Willie Nelson being attacked in a news article saying, Willie Nelson's delusional.
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.861]  I just saw this the other night.
[01:43:31.861 --> 01:43:34.062]  It's an article I've missed from this interview.
[01:43:34.062 --> 01:43:36.183]  He believes there were 15 hijackers, there were 19.
[01:43:38.069 --> 01:43:40.910]  God, look how dumb he is, that dope smoker.
[01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:42.571]  Another straw man.
[01:43:42.571 --> 01:43:46.332]  Willie was talking about how 15 of the 19 were from Saudi Arabia.
[01:43:46.332 --> 01:43:48.774]  He said, why'd we attack Iraq?
[01:43:48.774 --> 01:43:50.794]  15 of them came from Saudi Arabia.
[01:43:50.794 --> 01:43:52.535]  And it was clear what he said.
[01:43:52.535 --> 01:43:58.618]  But the spin doctors spin that, just like he said, nothing hit building 7.
[01:43:58.618 --> 01:44:01.579]  And they took his quotes out of context and said, look at the nut.
[01:44:01.579 --> 01:44:06.341]  He doesn't think a plane hit the towers.
[01:44:08.135 --> 01:44:10.576]  One and two.
[01:44:10.576 --> 01:44:16.357]  See, that's the constant deception that these dishonest people use to attack us.
[01:44:16.357 --> 01:44:21.558]  You know, if I'm gonna attack somebody, I'll attack them on what they've actually done.
[01:44:21.558 --> 01:44:22.999]  Because I have respect for myself.
[01:44:22.999 --> 01:44:26.219]  I have respect for myself intellectually that I'm trying to be a good person.
[01:44:26.219 --> 01:44:28.740]  I'm trying to really find out the truth and really bring it to you.
[01:44:35.492 --> 01:44:44.599]  That's why it's intellectually bankrupt to say I don't expose that the Vatican's part of the New World Order when the Pope's openly calling for a one-rule government, the last two Popes are involved in it.
[01:44:44.599 --> 01:44:48.082]  I just point out that so are Protestant groups, and people don't like that.
[01:44:48.082 --> 01:44:52.486]  They want to make it all about one group is the devil.
[01:44:52.486 --> 01:45:00.512]  But see, by doing that, you miss the big picture of how evil can manifest in any group or any organization, how we need to fight the policies of the New World Order.
[01:45:01.527 --> 01:45:03.789]  That's what I tell the Lori Conquistas out of Mexico.
[01:45:03.789 --> 01:45:05.230]  Okay, you want to bring it down to the U.S.?
[01:45:05.230 --> 01:45:06.590]  You want to take over?
[01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:08.172]  You really only had the country for 20 years?
[01:45:08.172 --> 01:45:10.113]  You couldn't hold it?
[01:45:10.113 --> 01:45:17.138]  If it belongs to anybody, it's the Native Americans and not the Mexicans from Mexico.
[01:45:17.138 --> 01:45:24.143]  And by the way, the New World Order, who's very bad, who's poisoning you with eugenics and doing all this, they're for you taking over.
[01:45:24.143 --> 01:45:25.564]  So right there, you're in the wrong.
[01:45:25.564 --> 01:45:27.485]  And they'll go, oh, wow, I see what you're saying.
[01:45:29.554 --> 01:45:34.576]  We got a Larry Conquista in Endgame, in the extras, in Battle for the Republic, that short film.
[01:45:34.576 --> 01:45:38.878]  We got them going, wow, that makes sense.
[01:45:38.878 --> 01:45:40.019]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:45:40.019 --> 01:45:52.624]  I find that IBM and the Gates and all these big rich people at the highest levels give money to eugenics, and the Rothschilds give money to eugenics, and are all into it, and I find out that they really did fund Hitler, and then I go, well, wait a minute.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:46:00.123]  Hitler is being funded by the big bankers and Lord Milner and the British aristocracy and the founders of modern Zionism.
[01:46:00.123 --> 01:46:01.144]  Something's going on here.
[01:46:01.144 --> 01:46:02.444]  This something's bigger.
[01:46:02.444 --> 01:46:08.867]  And then I find out that Jews and Nordics and Germans go to weird satanic rituals together.
[01:46:08.867 --> 01:46:13.629]  And I bring out news articles and quotes and documents and I go, there's an occultic aspect here.
[01:46:13.629 --> 01:46:19.352]  This isn't a, you know, this is different crime syndicates, different mafias who are racial.
[01:46:19.352 --> 01:46:22.653]  The Italian mob, the Jewish mob, the WASP mob.
[01:46:23.444 --> 01:46:24.705]  You know, other mobs.
[01:46:24.705 --> 01:46:28.886]  You know, there's the Asian mobs.
[01:46:28.886 --> 01:46:35.609]  They... are running racial mafias.
[01:46:35.609 --> 01:46:38.331]  You know, MS-13, Hispanic Mafia.
[01:46:38.331 --> 01:46:41.012]  Latin Kings.
[01:46:41.012 --> 01:46:47.555]  On and on, that's how we form into groups, but at the top, these guys are into Babylon Mystery Schools.
[01:46:47.555 --> 01:46:50.036]  People say, that's ridiculous, that's just made up.
[01:46:50.036 --> 01:46:50.676]  It's not!
[01:46:51.371 --> 01:46:52.972]  They really are into it.
[01:46:52.972 --> 01:46:57.774]  The UN Biological Diversity Assessments really is into the occult.
[01:46:57.774 --> 01:46:59.575]  Prince Philip really is into the occult.
[01:46:59.575 --> 01:47:01.596]  Ted Turner really is into the occult.
[01:47:01.596 --> 01:47:14.782]  Dr. Bianca, on his own UT website, he says he wants to kill 90% of us, is dressed up like a druid talking about Lucifer on the UT website.
[01:47:14.782 --> 01:47:18.944]  The new Israeli Parliament Supreme Court is a giant pyramid all-seeing eye.
[01:47:19.728 --> 01:47:35.116]  I mean, it's the same group, and so all I'm saying is that they're running it all, folks, and it's Catholics, it's Jews, it's Protestants, it's Muslims are involved in this.
[01:47:35.116 --> 01:47:37.437]  Whole Masonic Orders are Muslim.
[01:47:37.437 --> 01:47:39.938]  Their symbols are Islamic.
[01:47:39.938 --> 01:47:45.741]  The Knights Templars had deals with them, and I get Muslims sending me threatening emails saying, that's not true, how dare you say that?
[01:47:45.741 --> 01:47:47.442]  Well, your own Quran says you can't have idols.
[01:47:49.864 --> 01:47:52.546]  I mean, what are these things on top of your minarets?
[01:47:52.546 --> 01:47:54.447]  What are these symbols?
[01:47:54.447 --> 01:47:55.787]  What are these things you're wearing?
[01:47:55.787 --> 01:48:04.812]  I mean, this stuff is all over the place.
[01:48:04.812 --> 01:48:12.857]  And they love it when we fight with each other over black, white, Hispanic, white, Catholic, Protestant, all of this.
[01:48:12.857 --> 01:48:18.700]  My point is, if you really want to beat them, you've got to really realize the top group and who runs it all.
[01:48:20.951 --> 01:48:24.773]  The larger picture.
[01:48:24.773 --> 01:48:28.294]  And see how they play these double and triple games.
[01:48:28.294 --> 01:48:46.663]  I mean, here they are, attacking the Shiites that do want to be peaceful and aren't trying to take the country over, who've abided by the ceasefire, and then saying, oh, because you fought back, we're not going to let you be part of the election now because we're a democracy and people are going to elect you.
[01:48:50.026 --> 01:48:56.993]  And then this insult to the American people of, oh, well, the Iraqi government wants us to stay.
[01:48:56.993 --> 01:49:02.818]  The State Department and others and the Iraqi government have evacuated the Green Zone.
[01:49:02.818 --> 01:49:08.103]  There's still troops in a hospital there, but they've evacuated that palace and moved to another one.
[01:49:10.037 --> 01:49:14.159]  For four and a half years, they've spent, what is it, up to $10 billion now?
[01:49:14.159 --> 01:49:19.802]  It was supposed to be $5 billion, it's like $10 billion now, trying to build a 5,000-person, quote, U.S.
[01:49:19.802 --> 01:49:20.923]  embassy?
[01:49:20.923 --> 01:49:23.204]  That's an extermination tower.
[01:49:23.204 --> 01:49:27.566]  It's a genocide control arm.
[01:49:27.566 --> 01:49:28.526]  Citadel.
[01:49:28.526 --> 01:49:29.507]  And they can't even hold it.
[01:49:31.499 --> 01:49:47.210]  Because the wimps inside, the technocrats inside, are so cowardly, they can't even handle once a week a few mortars shooting over, and once a week with 40,000 people in the green zone total, a couple people dying a week.
[01:49:47.210 --> 01:49:52.053]  But that same yuppie technocrat will go get on the New York Expressway where there's deaths every day.
[01:49:52.947 --> 01:49:56.749]  See, the New World Order doesn't have what it takes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:56.749 --> 01:50:03.113]  They can't even carry out their extermination op because their own technocrats have got their tails between their legs in that green zone.
[01:50:03.113 --> 01:50:04.374]  And I ought to tell you something.
[01:50:04.374 --> 01:50:09.256]  New World Order technocrats 100 years ago would have been on the front lines.
[01:50:09.256 --> 01:50:18.802]  People like Churchill out there leading the black ops in South Africa, playing the Boers, the Dutch, off against the English.
[01:50:22.614 --> 01:50:26.916]  And the English working with the blacks.
[01:50:26.916 --> 01:50:28.997]  It's called the Great Game.
[01:50:28.997 --> 01:50:31.398]  The British adopted it from the Romans.
[01:50:31.398 --> 01:50:36.360]  They learned it from the Caesars.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:43.224]  And the system is Britannic in nature.
[01:50:43.224 --> 01:50:48.326]  And if you fully want to understand the mind of the New World Order, you must come to grips with that.
[01:50:51.997 --> 01:50:53.999]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:53.999 --> 01:50:57.623]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:57.623 --> 01:50:59.705]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:59.705 --> 01:51:03.149]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:03.149 --> 01:51:08.935]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:08.935 --> 01:51:12.880]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:53:51.917 --> 01:53:57.501]  Okay, we got one of the granny warriors.
[01:53:57.501 --> 01:53:59.022]  He's got a big rally in D.C.
[01:53:59.022 --> 01:54:00.263]  I'm gonna go to her in a minute.
[01:54:00.263 --> 01:54:01.344]  She called in to plug it.
[01:54:01.344 --> 01:54:02.384]  I'm guessing.
[01:54:02.384 --> 01:54:04.185]  She may have called in about something else.
[01:54:04.185 --> 01:54:05.787]  Linda.
[01:54:05.787 --> 01:54:09.589]  Uh, John disagrees in Ohio.
[01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:12.331]  So we have to go to him first.
[01:54:14.639 --> 01:54:18.721]  And then we'll go to Harry, Jason, Kevin, and others.
[01:54:18.721 --> 01:54:20.102]  I'm going to take a bunch of calls now.
[01:54:20.102 --> 01:54:21.543]  There's a lot of news I haven't even gotten to.
[01:54:21.543 --> 01:54:22.764]  We're going to cover it.
[01:54:22.764 --> 01:54:27.407]  But the good news is I'm not about to start my final hour.
[01:54:27.407 --> 01:54:31.909]  We're about to reach the halfway point of the show because there's a fourth hour now.
[01:54:31.909 --> 01:54:35.351]  We'll tell you more about that coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:35.351 --> 01:54:37.693]  Let's go ahead now and go to John in Ohio.
[01:54:37.693 --> 01:54:38.253]  Go ahead, John.
[01:54:41.354 --> 01:54:44.575]  I've been a supporter of about 60% of what you said.
[01:54:44.575 --> 01:54:49.837]  I think you do a magnificent job in analyzing, as you did, about what's going on in Iraq.
[01:54:49.837 --> 01:55:10.585]  The total hypocrisy of the media pretending the United States, with this divide in rule funding and arming one side against another, is really some kind of noble, angelic referee and is just trying to stay there forever because of these barbarics, uncivilized barbarians that just can't get it together when they live together, married together, before we went there.
[01:55:11.263 --> 01:55:28.515]  But on a larger scale, and I always have a lot of apprehension because I have about 20 things in my cluttered, muddled mind that would take two hours and I'll probably be just a foil that my ideas will become distorted, but I... John, I'll give you the time you need.
[01:55:28.515 --> 01:55:40.324]  The point here is, because you call in your reasonable when you disagree, my pet peeve is someone acting like we censor and that they're getting through and then reveling and it just makes me blow up.
[01:55:40.788 --> 01:55:42.590]  You don't do that.
[01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:45.832]  You're going to tell me that the globalists don't control and manipulate communism.
[01:55:45.832 --> 01:55:49.856]  It has now been declassified that our government put Mao Zedong into power.
[01:55:49.856 --> 01:55:58.823]  Well, let me point out that you know about Operation Mockingbird.
[01:55:58.823 --> 01:56:09.752]  You know that the corporate media, the Hydra heads, the thousands of fronts for the CIA and all of its other alphabet agencies, a target and punching bag for the last century,
[01:56:10.222 --> 01:56:14.223]  Has it been communism, anti-communist propaganda?
[01:56:14.223 --> 01:56:23.684]  No, they created it and helped fund it to create a false bipolar system to set up a police state here domestically in the name of fighting the boogeyman they controlled.
[01:56:23.684 --> 01:56:26.245]  Well, there's a few details that you overlook.
[01:56:26.245 --> 01:56:38.947]  The fact that immediately after the Bolshevik Revolution, the elite and 14 capitalist countries sent troops and divisions to strangle the Bolshevik Revolution in its crib, as Churchill said.
[01:56:39.611 --> 01:56:44.553]  That they financed Hitler based on his anti-Sovietism and his anti-communism.
[01:56:44.553 --> 01:56:46.373]  No, no, that's true.
[01:56:46.373 --> 01:56:57.937]  Let me stop you, but did New York and London banks send tens of thousands of people from Brooklyn to physically go help Lenin, or are you saying that admitted history isn't true?
[01:56:57.937 --> 01:57:01.218]  I don't believe it's true, but I do know that it's true.
[01:57:01.218 --> 01:57:05.519]  For instance, even though I've never belonged to any organization, but I have read various
[01:57:06.378 --> 01:57:31.410]  uh... communist uh... literature and during uh... the sixties in the seventies i read uh... p l p p l p dot org who are or a part of s d s they were absolutely they were communist they were gaining an amazing influence within s d s the uh... bill ayers and the uh... birdie dorn faction was rapid rapidly anti-communist uh... most people think they were police asian provocateurs who advocated this kind of
[01:57:31.843 --> 01:57:37.126]  Counterproductive violence that always leads to a crackdown on people.
[01:57:37.126 --> 01:57:42.148]  They were totally criticized by the PLP people, the communists, and they split up.
[01:57:42.148 --> 01:57:52.333]  Well, there's no doubt that Bill Clinton let the communist bombers out of jail, and that most of them, it turned out, were feds before and would never go to jail, and they would just bust one of the lower patsies.
[01:57:52.333 --> 01:57:55.615]  But the point I'm making is they were not communists, they were anti-communists.
[01:57:55.615 --> 01:57:59.357]  And I was listening to Bob Chapman yesterday on the Power Hour,
[01:57:59.815 --> 01:58:16.336]  And you know, he's a conservative, and I don't speak for him, but he made the point that this so-called human rights activity around Tibet is really heavily involved by the CIA, the NED, and all of its agencies to blackmail the Chinese into not calling in their chips.
[01:58:16.937 --> 01:58:17.897]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:44.511 --> 01:58:46.273]  A New World Order.
[01:58:46.273 --> 01:58:50.797]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:58:50.797 --> 01:58:54.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.782]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.782 --> 01:58:59.965]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.965 --> 01:59:07.292]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.314 --> 01:59:15.756]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.756 --> 01:59:19.638]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:19.638 --> 01:59:22.199]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:22.199 --> 01:59:23.360]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:24.140]  They're not after money.
[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:25.421]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.421 --> 01:59:26.401]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.401 --> 01:59:27.562]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:59:37.046 --> 01:59:39.067]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:59:39.067 --> 01:59:44.329]  You have been warned.
[01:59:44.329 --> 01:59:46.710]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.710 --> 01:59:49.471]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:57.729]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.729 --> 01:59:59.330]  You want answers?
[01:59:59.330 --> 02:00:00.891]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:00.891 --> 02:00:05.074]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.074 --> 02:00:15.340]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:20.303]  What they do is they get you in a free market slash communist left-right paradigm.
[02:00:21.579 --> 02:00:28.001]  And then people who are defending the free market say it never does anything wrong and people defending the communist view say it never does anything wrong.
[02:00:28.001 --> 02:00:41.826]  Anything that's command and control will immediately be abused and used by a ruling class and communism has always turned into a bottom-up conduit of the wealth faster than anything else.
[02:00:41.826 --> 02:00:43.347]  I am for local control.
[02:00:44.424 --> 02:01:02.602]  I am even for, as the Founding Fathers pushed, you know, if people locally want some governmental system with more control, they can have it, but at the national level, it's very small, very weak, and you can have a choice of going to what state you want or doing what you want, different choices in the 13 colonies, and...
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:09.162]  And so, John, I mean, go ahead.
[02:01:37.024 --> 02:01:46.814]  Alex, for one thing, Alexander Coburn pointed out that anything that the present regimes in China or Russia say have to be taken with less than a grain of salt.
[02:01:46.814 --> 02:01:49.116]  They're the mortal enemies of the former regime.
[02:01:49.116 --> 02:01:57.684]  The CIA and the FBI has been all over those files, forging and the rest of it, so there's nothing you can get from the present regime who is the mortal enemy.
[02:01:57.684 --> 02:02:01.067]  For instance, Yeltsin bombed his own parliament and killed about 400
[02:02:02.208 --> 02:02:15.590]  Remnant communists because they didn't want to give up the social safety net policies that the new beauties of capitalism... You mean he rolled in with tanks and artillery and blew the hell out of their elected parliament.
[02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:18.471]  Be like blowing up the Congress and everybody in it.
[02:02:18.471 --> 02:02:21.472]  Oh yeah, the communists were really elected.
[02:02:21.472 --> 02:02:26.012]  They were elected every bit as much as Yeltsin was, that's true.
[02:02:26.012 --> 02:02:29.413]  So all I'm saying is that... They were not elected!
[02:02:30.157 --> 02:02:32.821]  Or Uncle Joe Stalin, our good buddy.
[02:02:32.821 --> 02:02:34.563]  I'm talking about in the 90s.
[02:02:34.563 --> 02:02:37.127]  I'm talking about in the 90s when Yeltsin brought up the artillery.
[02:02:37.127 --> 02:02:37.908]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:02:37.908 --> 02:02:40.912]  Why do we have all these Trotskyites who are now the neocons today?
[02:02:42.078 --> 02:02:46.440]  They probably never were, even in their trendy youth.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:48.541]  I think they were police agents and spies.
[02:02:48.541 --> 02:02:57.904]  No, they were thugs who wanted power and they'll take on a neoconservative guys, they'll take on a commie guys, they'll take on anything.
[02:02:57.904 --> 02:03:04.247]  And certainly the rest of their career was rabidly, the most rabid anti-communist.
[02:03:04.247 --> 02:03:09.069]  In the Reagan administration, they got their real home and they killed
[02:03:09.634 --> 02:03:16.080]  Scores of thousands of people in the name of anti-communism, Latin and Central American, the Iran-Contra days.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:27.872]  So I'm just saying that whether the present China, capitalist China I would say mostly, is good, bad, or indifferent, the motive for the Project for a New American Century
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.362]  Is to cut, is to divide and rule that country as well.
[02:03:31.362 --> 02:03:43.652]  Russia, just as you're saying, in the Middle East, their policies are, and they will use, whether that government is good, bad, or... Well, there's no doubt, there's no doubt that they're using the Tibetans as a set piece against the Communist Chinese.
[02:03:43.652 --> 02:03:45.233]  John, I appreciate your call.
[02:03:45.233 --> 02:03:48.095]  What you're saying there's true, the rest of it is just not true.
[02:03:48.095 --> 02:03:52.018]  I just, I mean, I just, you can't admit your whole life.
[02:03:52.018 --> 02:03:52.879]  What are you, probably 65 years old?
[02:03:54.381 --> 02:04:00.966]  You've been serving socialism, communism, bleeding heart, you mean well, and you just can't get it.
[02:04:00.966 --> 02:04:03.948]  You just can't get the fact that McCarthy was right.
[02:04:03.948 --> 02:04:12.134]  That McCarthy was being used to destroy liberties and freedoms and bully Hollywood into supporting right-wing fascism in this country.
[02:04:12.134 --> 02:04:23.242]  But as soon as he found out the army and the banks were funding the communists, which is a fact, the Rockefellers, the Carnegie Endowment, all of them, factories over there, everything, they ran him out on a rail.
[02:04:24.710 --> 02:04:28.091]  China isn't capitalist, it's a slave grid.
[02:04:28.091 --> 02:04:34.594]  With a bunch of fat cat commies on top, feeding off the slaves below them.
[02:04:34.594 --> 02:04:38.235]  Their families pass on the power now over there.
[02:04:38.235 --> 02:04:43.497]  You defeat the elite by getting rid of the government.
[02:04:43.497 --> 02:04:47.039]  The elite need the government as a lever of control over us, the people.
[02:04:47.039 --> 02:04:47.499]  Wake up!
[02:04:48.959 --> 02:04:51.801]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:51.801 --> 02:04:53.362]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:04:53.362 --> 02:04:55.524]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:04:55.524 --> 02:04:57.425]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:04:57.425 --> 02:04:58.906]  The late great USA.
[02:04:58.906 --> 02:05:00.667]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:06:53.946 --> 02:06:59.370]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:06:59.370 --> 02:07:04.755]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:07:04.755 --> 02:07:10.659]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:07:10.659 --> 02:07:14.943]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[02:07:15.123 --> 02:07:16.864]  Most people are overly acidic.
[02:07:16.864 --> 02:07:20.667]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:07:20.667 --> 02:07:25.491]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:07:25.491 --> 02:07:26.531]  Do your part.
[02:07:26.531 --> 02:07:29.153]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[02:07:49.763 --> 02:07:56.406]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:56.406 --> 02:07:59.387]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:05.174 --> 02:08:09.016]  Okay, let's go to Linda Honeycutt of the Granny Warriors.
[02:08:09.016 --> 02:08:11.497]  I'm gonna go to Harry, Jason, Kevin, and others.
[02:08:11.497 --> 02:08:12.497]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Linda.
[02:08:12.497 --> 02:08:18.780]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted, you were right, I just wanted to plug our April 15th thing.
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:20.321]  Well, tell folks about it.
[02:08:20.321 --> 02:08:21.441]  Huh?
[02:08:21.441 --> 02:08:22.822]  Tell folks about it.
[02:08:22.822 --> 02:08:25.423]  Well, we're gonna have one heck of a rally there.
[02:08:25.423 --> 02:08:32.206]  It's not just a Ron Paul rally, it's a rally we're trying to unite all these different factions together to work together so we'll have one big army.
[02:08:33.157 --> 02:08:42.783]  To fight all this corruption, which we're taking one step forward and two back with all these little battles against the NAU, against Real ID.
[02:08:42.783 --> 02:08:45.485]  We need to all get together and get our shit together.
[02:08:45.485 --> 02:08:54.050]  Listen, I appreciate your call, but we really have to try to control our language on this show, and I'm just going to have to start banning anybody that cusses, including myself.
[02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:56.592]  If I do it again, I'll just ban myself.
[02:08:56.592 --> 02:08:57.252]  How's that sound?
[02:09:00.126 --> 02:09:02.167]  Everybody always wants to make one group.
[02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:09.532]  Everybody always wants to only have one organization.
[02:09:09.532 --> 02:09:13.275]  I always have said the opposite.
[02:09:13.275 --> 02:09:19.999]  We need lots of small and medium and large organizations tackling different subjects, different topics.
[02:09:19.999 --> 02:09:26.083]  And I know I was invited to your rally in D.C., but I want to spend time with my family, and I've put links to it and promoted it.
[02:09:28.142 --> 02:09:30.883]  I know some folks from Genesis are going to it, and I wish them well.
[02:09:30.883 --> 02:09:32.685]  I'm told Ron Paul's going to be speaking there.
[02:09:32.685 --> 02:09:38.368]  Then there's the big rally coming up later in the summer that Ron Paul, that's his official rally of Ron Paul's.
[02:09:38.368 --> 02:09:39.749]  I might go to that.
[02:09:39.749 --> 02:09:42.931]  Regardless, I'm going to be supporting it and promoting it.
[02:09:42.931 --> 02:09:50.016]  What happens in these moves to unify organizations and groups
[02:09:51.588 --> 02:09:58.590]  Is that what it means if somebody stands up at one of these events and says, you will do what I say or you're not for unity.
[02:09:58.590 --> 02:10:08.814]  And then the people that don't want to follow their orders turn into the bad people.
[02:10:08.814 --> 02:10:17.297]  And I've seen so many people arrive on the scene and Linda Honeycutt's a nice lady and the Granny Warriors done a great job, but they've been around for, I don't know, six, seven years.
[02:10:17.297 --> 02:10:20.918]  I forget doing different events since I've heard about them and talk to them.
[02:10:28.582 --> 02:10:31.865]  And then there's always this call for unity.
[02:10:31.865 --> 02:10:41.554]  One of the few times we ever had true unity was Ron Paul.
[02:10:41.554 --> 02:10:46.339]  And Ron Paul, about two months ago, had hit his peak, had unbelievable political capital,
[02:10:49.309 --> 02:10:55.194]  And people saw him as the leader, and still do to a certain extent, and were ready to be directed.
[02:10:55.194 --> 02:11:17.732]  And I privately, off-air and on-air, last time he was on with us a month ago, said, you need to go after the NAU, you need to go after NAFTA reauthorization, you need to go after socialized healthcare, Second Amendment issues, and put out flyers for folks to download, put out a battle plan, because people need goals, and we've got some serious fights
[02:11:18.932 --> 02:11:20.113]  Uh, that are in front of us.
[02:11:20.113 --> 02:11:21.994]  I said also, you know, ending the war.
[02:11:21.994 --> 02:11:35.099]  And you can galvanize what would be seen as a progressive or liberal arm against the war, bring libertarians into that, a pro-gun group for conservatives and, uh, you know, anti-socialized healthcare to educate people.
[02:11:35.099 --> 02:11:37.540]  And he said, yeah, we're planning on doing that.
[02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:38.641]  We're planning on doing that.
[02:11:38.641 --> 02:11:40.602]  And I understand it's hard to start new organizations.
[02:11:40.602 --> 02:11:43.123]  It's hard to put out battle plans.
[02:11:43.123 --> 02:11:44.344]  Uh, he's still campaigning.
[02:11:44.344 --> 02:11:45.244]  He's still doing that.
[02:11:46.213 --> 02:11:48.635]  As he says, to educate people in the process.
[02:11:48.635 --> 02:12:00.083]  And then I saw all the energy, or 90% of it, in the movement to getting delegates and people saying, because we're going to make him president, we're going to go vote as delegates and he's going to be the nominee.
[02:12:00.083 --> 02:12:11.652]  And I said, well, go be delegates, but also understand that politically, if somebody's got 60 delegates, but you go take over a thousand delegates,
[02:12:12.703 --> 02:12:19.748]  That it'll be political suicide to come in and say, we don't care if you voted for these other candidates, we're now saying it's Ron Paul.
[02:12:19.748 --> 02:12:21.949]  That just won't happen.
[02:12:21.949 --> 02:12:25.572]  And we're gonna see, we're gonna see who's right about this.
[02:12:25.572 --> 02:12:34.778]  And see the people who are for going in an insurrection and making Ron Paul the Republican nominee, they then won't have a honest debate about it.
[02:12:35.692 --> 02:12:38.033]  They will say, Alex is against us being delegates.
[02:12:38.033 --> 02:12:40.233]  Alex is against us changing the platform.
[02:12:40.233 --> 02:12:42.854]  Alex is against us going in and taking over the party.
[02:12:42.854 --> 02:12:44.774]  No, I said do that!
[02:12:44.774 --> 02:12:50.755]  That's great, but the problem is, let's say you go get a thousand delegates.
[02:12:50.755 --> 02:12:55.696]  Which, nowhere near, that's not gonna happen, but let's just say in a magic world that happened.
[02:12:55.696 --> 02:12:58.777]  And they go and they say, okay, we give our votes to Ron Paul.
[02:12:58.777 --> 02:13:02.718]  Ron Paul is going to say, no, honor the popular vote.
[02:13:03.368 --> 02:13:06.169]  Now, he told, his office told Ted Anderson that.
[02:13:06.169 --> 02:13:08.730]  He said that in a press release.
[02:13:08.730 --> 02:13:15.794]  I asked him about it during a break and he says, no, people need to support, with the delegates, you know, who they're, you know, who that delegate supposedly represents.
[02:13:15.794 --> 02:13:17.894]  And then people say, I want to hear Dr. Paul say that.
[02:13:17.894 --> 02:13:19.135]  I want to see it.
[02:13:19.135 --> 02:13:22.096]  He put it out in a press release.
[02:13:22.096 --> 02:13:25.798]  He called, uh, in fact, get Ted Anderson in here, drag him in here.
[02:13:26.573 --> 02:13:28.333]  He was one of the head guys in Minneapolis-St.
[02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:29.654]  Paul in the Ron Paul campaign.
[02:13:29.654 --> 02:13:31.754]  Put up the Ron Paul Air Force, all of this.
[02:13:31.754 --> 02:13:36.515]  And they were instructed by the Ron Paul campaign to give their delegates to John McCain.
[02:13:36.515 --> 02:13:38.955]  Will you go get him for me?
[02:13:38.955 --> 02:13:40.895]  I know you're paging him, but physically go grab him.
[02:13:40.895 --> 02:13:42.856]  It's okay.
[02:13:42.856 --> 02:13:45.796]  And I'm gonna have some guests on about this.
[02:13:45.796 --> 02:13:48.037]  People who were out there pushing and getting the delegates.
[02:13:48.037 --> 02:13:49.297]  I've invited some on.
[02:13:49.297 --> 02:13:51.877]  One of them was too busy to come on today.
[02:13:51.877 --> 02:13:53.738]  Maybe I'll get him on the next few days.
[02:13:53.738 --> 02:13:55.378]  Because they worked nights and they were just too tired.
[02:13:56.698 --> 02:14:01.803]  But, I mean, we'll lay out how this process works and talk about it.
[02:14:01.803 --> 02:14:05.906]  But, the thing about we all gotta get together.
[02:14:05.906 --> 02:14:11.450]  You know, people doing the NAU and people doing this subject and that subject.
[02:14:11.450 --> 02:14:12.011]  Well, no!
[02:14:12.011 --> 02:14:14.773]  I mean, we needed Ron Paul and he still can do it.
[02:14:14.773 --> 02:14:15.654]  It's not too late.
[02:14:15.654 --> 02:14:16.935]  A lot of his energy is dissipating.
[02:14:16.935 --> 02:14:18.776]  It's like a bullet you fire into something.
[02:14:18.776 --> 02:14:20.858]  Ninety percent of the energy is dissipated.
[02:14:20.858 --> 02:14:22.059]  Some of it may come back.
[02:14:22.557 --> 02:14:27.181]  Kind of like an exploding bullet to the New World Order's torso if he activates now.
[02:14:27.181 --> 02:14:34.167]  Even if that bullet slows down, they've got some exploding bullets that when they do slow down and basically finish expanding, then they explode.
[02:14:34.167 --> 02:14:38.991]  So there's an analogy saying it could come back, grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[02:14:38.991 --> 02:14:42.234]  But we've already had a victory here.
[02:14:42.234 --> 02:14:47.519]  We've already energized, woken up tens of millions, exposed the New World Order, exposed the North American Union.
[02:14:48.297 --> 02:14:52.101]  We need to stop being pessimistic and angry and expecting everything to be organized.
[02:14:52.101 --> 02:14:56.827]  The revolution wasn't organized.
[02:14:56.827 --> 02:15:01.612]  We need to understand we are ragtag and be positive.
[02:15:01.612 --> 02:15:05.957]  And then, Ron Paul needs to put out a treatise of, this is the National Coalition,
[02:15:07.107 --> 02:15:08.028]  This is what we want you to do.
[02:15:08.028 --> 02:15:10.330]  Grassroots with your own creative ideas.
[02:15:10.330 --> 02:15:11.851]  Defeat socialized health care.
[02:15:11.851 --> 02:15:13.513]  End the war.
[02:15:13.513 --> 02:15:16.355]  Force both parties to stop it.
[02:15:16.355 --> 02:15:18.337]  A coalition on the economy.
[02:15:18.337 --> 02:15:22.340]  Ron Paul needs to put out a five-page plan of what he would do to fix the economy.
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:25.943]  I know he's introduced bills to do it, but he needs to state it in like a manifesto.
[02:15:25.943 --> 02:15:33.149]  Ron Paul in 20 pages could lay out four parts, five pages apiece, laid out with his ideas.
[02:15:35.985 --> 02:15:46.312]  About how to tackle each subject, and how to energize, and people would form into cadres, and they would, and we've got the army of 20, 30 million people, probably more, who will get involved and do it.
[02:15:46.312 --> 02:15:52.996]  Instead, they're feeling pessimistic, and thinking, oh, it was all for naught, or they're drinking Kool-Aid, going, he's gonna be president still.
[02:15:52.996 --> 02:15:54.097]  Shh, it's a secret.
[02:15:54.097 --> 02:15:55.458]  Ron Paul's for it.
[02:15:55.458 --> 02:16:04.624]  He's, he's gonna, he's gonna, secretly, we're gonna say he's the nominee, and he's gonna stand up and take it, and we're gonna go off the yellow brick road together.
[02:16:05.749 --> 02:16:10.710]  Off into the sunset.
[02:16:10.710 --> 02:16:22.453]  And just because I say what I think, I don't sit here like a preacher and telling you, you know, everything's gonna be alright, just put your money in the collections plate.
[02:16:22.453 --> 02:16:32.116]  Or one of these politicians that says they've got everything nailed down and everything's wonderful.
[02:16:32.116 --> 02:16:33.056]  I know how this works.
[02:16:34.565 --> 02:16:43.053]  When it blows up in their faces, it'll be, well, it would have worked if people like Alex Jones would have gotten behind it.
[02:16:43.053 --> 02:16:50.740]  I am behind you taking over the delegates, enforcing changes in the platform, and taking over the party system, and that's good and that's wonderful.
[02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:52.441]  And you're doing it in some areas.
[02:16:52.441 --> 02:17:00.949]  Just don't set expectations that there is a 99% chance are not going to be met.
[02:17:02.441 --> 02:17:07.242]  Remember Ron Paul's letter that first one he put out, which they interpreted as saying he was getting out of the campaign?
[02:17:07.242 --> 02:17:16.484]  No, he just said, well, it's clear that we're not, that I'm not going to be the nominee, and we're not going to get the delegates, but I'm going to continue this fight, and it now goes into another phase.
[02:17:16.484 --> 02:17:18.525]  It's bigger than me.
[02:17:18.525 --> 02:17:21.085]  The revolution is permanent.
[02:17:21.085 --> 02:17:23.866]  To use a Trotsky quote.
[02:17:23.866 --> 02:17:25.906]  And he was laughing about it, you know, using that quote.
[02:17:25.906 --> 02:17:28.547]  Our revolution against them is permanent.
[02:17:28.547 --> 02:17:29.347]  It's about you.
[02:17:30.461 --> 02:17:32.543]  That's why I've always said it's not about Alex Jones.
[02:17:32.543 --> 02:17:35.365]  I could be killed, set up, framed, anytime now.
[02:17:35.365 --> 02:17:38.388]  I pray that isn't the case.
[02:17:38.388 --> 02:17:41.791]  But, you know, I'm in the danger zone.
[02:17:41.791 --> 02:17:42.872]  It isn't about me.
[02:17:42.872 --> 02:17:47.416]  I don't want it to be called a personality or fizzle out or be limited.
[02:17:47.416 --> 02:17:49.478]  I want the victory.
[02:17:49.478 --> 02:17:55.383]  And the victory is in you taking on the manifesto of liberty and freedom, understanding it.
[02:17:56.078 --> 02:18:21.612]  An understanding that statism and elitism and corruption and bullying can take the form of Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Germans, Communist Chinese, Venezuelan strongmen, Mexican oligarchs, and good can also take the form and manifestation of
[02:18:22.173 --> 02:18:28.758]  Chinese, and Jews, and Germans, and Catholics, and Protestants.
[02:18:28.758 --> 02:18:31.881]  And so we need to understand, what are the policies of the New World Order?
[02:18:31.881 --> 02:18:36.665]  They want to federalize local areas to bring those federal bodies into larger unions.
[02:18:36.665 --> 02:18:37.846]  They want to break up the family.
[02:18:37.846 --> 02:18:39.207]  They want you to go to public school.
[02:18:39.207 --> 02:18:41.168]  They want you to take drugs and vaccines.
[02:18:41.168 --> 02:18:43.110]  We know they poison the water.
[02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:47.694]  Do they put out a memo telling Catholics, because it's all Catholic run, don't drink the water?
[02:18:47.694 --> 02:18:48.154]  No, they don't.
[02:18:50.555 --> 02:18:55.478]  If it's all Jew-run, do they put out memos to Jews, don't drink the water?
[02:18:55.478 --> 02:18:57.299]  Don't take the vaccines?
[02:18:57.299 --> 02:19:00.421]  No, they don't.
[02:19:00.421 --> 02:19:04.104]  It was all, uh... Let me think of another one.
[02:19:04.104 --> 02:19:06.885]  That's the two main groups.
[02:19:06.885 --> 02:19:13.690]  If it's all alien-run, you know, it's... From the somewhat serious to the absurd.
[02:19:13.690 --> 02:19:15.651]  Alright, I said I'd take calls.
[02:19:15.651 --> 02:19:17.272]  I am on quite a rant today.
[02:19:19.468 --> 02:19:31.373]  When we come back, I'm going to go as quickly as I can to Harry, Jason, Kevin, and we got a whole fourth hour coming up with a bunch of news.
[02:19:31.373 --> 02:19:32.533]  I'll tell you about some of that.

[02:20:31.187 --> 02:20:32.448]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:32.448 --> 02:20:33.069]  They're after power.
[02:20:33.069 --> 02:20:34.590]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:23:55.086 --> 02:24:00.651]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[02:24:00.651 --> 02:24:06.155]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[02:24:06.155 --> 02:24:11.560]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:15.123]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[02:24:16.823 --> 02:24:19.385]  Alright, let's go to Harry in Michigan.
[02:24:19.385 --> 02:24:21.446]  Thanks for holding, Harry.
[02:24:21.446 --> 02:24:22.207]  You're a trooper.
[02:24:22.207 --> 02:24:23.868]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[02:24:48.038 --> 02:24:48.618]  Alex?
[02:24:48.618 --> 02:24:49.199]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:49.199 --> 02:24:52.180]  Hey, good talking to you.
[02:24:52.180 --> 02:24:59.244]  I was really glad to hear your guest the other day, Alan from Canada.
[02:24:59.244 --> 02:25:00.004]  Yeah, Alan Wong.
[02:25:00.004 --> 02:25:00.685]  Great guy.
[02:25:00.685 --> 02:25:01.425]  Oh, yeah, man.
[02:25:01.425 --> 02:25:06.028]  He spits it right out.
[02:25:06.028 --> 02:25:13.052]  His version of the New World Order, just recaps my feelings about it.
[02:25:13.052 --> 02:25:16.794]  I've been knowing about it for a long time now.
[02:25:18.346 --> 02:25:27.308]  And people in the United States need to start picking up a book, which, what, one a year if they're lucky?
[02:25:27.308 --> 02:25:30.468]  And read about Albert Pike and Albert Mackey, J.D.
[02:25:30.468 --> 02:25:41.971]  Bluck, Daniel Sickleton, all about the New World Order, which my belief is is the Masonic-inspired version of it.
[02:25:45.213 --> 02:25:51.975]  I've had a lot of flack throughout the years, and trying to teach, you know, to bring it forth.
[02:25:51.975 --> 02:25:52.735]  Well, that's what it is.
[02:25:52.735 --> 02:26:06.118]  It's a hall of mirrors, and it is a mystery religion of being behind every major group and playing everybody off against each other, and then what they are are scientists who understand how to manipulate the tribalism of humanity.
[02:26:06.118 --> 02:26:06.638]  Exactly.
[02:26:06.638 --> 02:26:08.399]  It's all symbolism, you know.
[02:26:09.798 --> 02:26:17.582]  You know, you work your way up to, say, a 7th degree, which is the great knowledge of who is God, you know?
[02:26:17.582 --> 02:26:25.425]  And they base themselves off of that, and it's a secret inside of a secret inside of a secret in the secret.
[02:26:25.425 --> 02:26:28.286]  It's like China dolls or the Russian dolls.
[02:26:28.286 --> 02:26:29.967]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:29.967 --> 02:26:33.389]  And I've been at war with them for years.
[02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:35.590]  When in my younger days, back in the 70s,
[02:26:37.276 --> 02:26:46.244]  I got into it with a Shriner and an Inspector General, which anybody knows that's a 33rd.
[02:26:46.244 --> 02:26:48.906]  And I made toast out of them, you know.
[02:26:51.630 --> 02:27:10.166]  Well, that's why we have our own symbols of liberty and freedom, and we have to counter anything that takes liberty, anything that takes freedom, anything that oppresses the innocents, and then judge a group, are they doing bad, and then confront them for the bad they're doing, not for the group they are.
[02:27:10.166 --> 02:27:14.890]  Because if you confront them on their group, then the tribalism kicks in of their minions.
[02:27:15.650 --> 02:27:26.556]  All of these groups have predators at the top who feed on their lowers and they keep the lowers under their control by always claiming the outside hates you, I protect you.
[02:27:26.556 --> 02:27:29.058]  The inner party protects the outer party.
[02:27:29.058 --> 02:27:29.718]  Okay?
[02:27:29.718 --> 02:27:32.280]  And so that's what Orwell talked about.
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:33.861]  And so it's predatory.
[02:27:33.861 --> 02:27:37.783]  And so when you go out and say, I don't like Mexicans and are racist,
[02:27:38.203 --> 02:27:48.288]  Then it only helps the La Rican Kesa, but when you point out to them how the big banks are financing the breakdown of the entire Americas, and how they're being set up and used, they wake up.
[02:27:48.288 --> 02:27:59.013]  Or, when you go to a Catholic and say, you're not a bad person, your heritage isn't bad, it's just, without getting into a debate, does the Pope call for a one-world government?
[02:27:59.013 --> 02:28:00.614]  Do they call for a one-world religion?
[02:28:01.034 --> 02:28:01.715]  Is that bad?
[02:28:01.715 --> 02:28:02.656]  They say yes.
[02:28:02.656 --> 02:28:04.479]  Okay, then you move on.
[02:28:04.479 --> 02:28:10.166]  Okay, are the Protestant religions basically part of Israel worship now, saying Israel's God?
[02:28:10.166 --> 02:28:10.807]  Yes.
[02:28:10.807 --> 02:28:11.528]  Is that wrong?
[02:28:11.528 --> 02:28:12.228]  Is that weird?
[02:28:12.228 --> 02:28:14.912]  Is Hagee saying Jesus wasn't the Messiah?
[02:28:14.912 --> 02:28:15.733]  Is that bad?
[02:28:15.733 --> 02:28:17.135]  Okay, boom, move on.
[02:28:17.735 --> 02:28:19.197]  Uh, then you explain to masons.
[02:28:19.197 --> 02:28:21.860]  Hey, I'm not saying all the masons are bad.
[02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:28.288]  Most of them, up until about 32 degrees, don't even really have an inkling they're porch masons or outside masons.
[02:28:28.288 --> 02:28:30.551]  You go to them and say, yeah, the founding fathers were masons.
[02:28:30.551 --> 02:28:31.853]  Yeah, they were good guys.
[02:28:31.853 --> 02:28:34.316]  And later they found out when they got into higher levels that it had been,
[02:28:34.976 --> 02:28:36.017]  They thought it had been taken over.
[02:28:36.017 --> 02:28:37.418]  It had really always been that way.
[02:28:37.418 --> 02:28:38.759]  And they wrote about it.
[02:28:38.759 --> 02:28:47.166]  And so you can be like George Washington, who woke up, and then they wake up, and you say, you dirty masons all drink blood.
[02:28:47.166 --> 02:28:50.389]  They will say, well, I'm not into that, so it's not true.
[02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:52.190]  And then they think you're a liar.
[02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:53.912]  That's a fact.
[02:28:53.912 --> 02:28:59.016]  I mean, do you understand why this is so important?
[02:28:59.016 --> 02:29:01.578]  Because this is the only way to attack the New World Order.
[02:29:03.021 --> 02:29:13.385]  Definitely, and I've had many conversations with lower-level Masons, and they find it hard to believe what's going on, really.
[02:29:13.385 --> 02:29:18.667]  And I'll get my books out from Albert Pike and all the rest of them, and I'll do the quotations.
[02:29:18.667 --> 02:29:28.811]  Tell you what, I've got to be fair to other callers, but I'm going to give you two minutes on the other side, Harry, and then I'm going to go to Jason and others that have been holding, because I want people to hear this.
[02:29:28.811 --> 02:29:30.312]  I've had discussions with Masons as well.
[02:29:31.303 --> 02:29:36.787]  And if you approach it without having a bunch of tribalism involved, and rationally, you can wake them up.
[02:29:36.787 --> 02:29:39.169]  If you don't, you're gonna fail.
[02:29:39.169 --> 02:29:40.570]  We're on the march.
[02:29:40.570 --> 02:29:43.092]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:43.092 --> 02:29:45.794]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:49.718 --> 02:29:50.439]  Alright, Dad.
[02:29:50.439 --> 02:29:51.739]  Let me get this straight.
[02:29:51.739 --> 02:29:53.901]  Unstoppable Liberties takes place in the future, right?
[02:29:53.901 --> 02:29:54.942]  Like Star Wars?
[02:29:54.942 --> 02:29:55.782]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:29:55.782 --> 02:29:56.963]  Slightly in the future.
[02:29:56.963 --> 02:29:58.024]  Wait a second.
[02:29:58.024 --> 02:30:01.307]  I thought Star Wars took place a long, long time ago.
[02:30:01.307 --> 02:30:02.347]  Alright, Einstein.
[02:30:02.347 --> 02:30:04.529]  But it is kind of like Star Wars anyway.
[02:30:04.529 --> 02:30:11.454]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight the evil empire.
[02:30:11.454 --> 02:30:13.055]  Okay, so don't tell me.
[02:30:13.055 --> 02:30:14.736]  The government's the bad guys again?
[02:30:14.736 --> 02:30:15.877]  Yep, that's right.
[02:30:15.877 --> 02:30:18.579]  Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker?
[02:30:18.579 --> 02:30:19.320]  Not exactly.
[02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:21.721]  I know, you're Chewbacca!
[02:30:21.721 --> 02:30:30.804]  Not really, but my character does help the rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties.
[02:30:30.804 --> 02:30:33.945]  Wait a second, they can't track us, it's a free country!
[02:30:33.945 --> 02:30:35.506]  Exactly.
[02:30:35.506 --> 02:30:39.327]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[02:30:48.953 --> 02:30:55.076]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:30:55.076 --> 02:31:00.379]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:31:00.379 --> 02:31:06.763]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[02:31:06.783 --> 02:31:07.163]  I think so.

[02:32:19.278 --> 02:32:25.702]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[02:32:25.702 --> 02:32:30.525]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[02:32:30.525 --> 02:32:34.847]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[02:32:34.847 --> 02:32:35.648]  It's that simple.
[02:32:35.968 --> 02:32:39.589]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[02:32:39.589 --> 02:32:42.890]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[02:32:42.890 --> 02:33:02.536]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[02:33:02.536 --> 02:33:03.416]  Front porch sittin',
[02:33:04.702 --> 02:33:14.859]  In an old rocking chair, the sun is hot in the Texas sky.
[02:33:14.859 --> 02:33:18.805]  Garden growing, clothes out on a line.
[02:33:20.421 --> 02:33:22.542]  This just in.
[02:33:22.542 --> 02:33:26.102]  It's going to be a five hour radio show today.
[02:33:26.102 --> 02:33:29.643]  I've just decided to go to two hours extra.
[02:33:29.643 --> 02:33:31.764]  Now I'm not going to do that every day.
[02:33:31.764 --> 02:33:35.425]  You know why I decided to do it?
[02:33:35.425 --> 02:33:42.327]  National British Radio is calling me at 310 Central about ten minutes after I'd be off air today.
[02:33:42.327 --> 02:33:43.207]  We've added the fourth hour.
[02:33:44.167 --> 02:33:47.309]  And I'm on until right at the end of that hour.
[02:33:47.309 --> 02:33:49.310]  So I thought, why not just do a simulcast?
[02:33:49.310 --> 02:33:52.932]  I'm already going to be in here in studio on the headset.
[02:33:52.932 --> 02:34:02.878]  And maybe when I do other interviews now, when I'm here at the office and it's on ISDN or even phone, maybe I'll patch it in and just randomly pop in with live transmissions.
[02:34:02.878 --> 02:34:08.001]  Because I'm always doing radio interviews anyways, you know, when you think my four hours is over, oh no!
[02:34:08.001 --> 02:34:09.442]  It's just beginning here.
[02:34:09.442 --> 02:34:09.482]  So...
[02:34:12.574 --> 02:34:22.362]  When I'm on the radio in South Africa, or Australia, or Germany, or Japan, or England, or Mexico, that's the answer.
[02:34:22.362 --> 02:34:25.445]  We'll start, when we can, firing it up.
[02:34:25.445 --> 02:34:27.286]  So, there isn't a whole other hour coming up.
[02:34:27.286 --> 02:34:30.269]  By the way, I just, I took probably, what, 20 calls in that hour yesterday?
[02:34:30.269 --> 02:34:32.470]  That'll take a lot.
[02:34:32.470 --> 02:34:39.736]  For some reason, I'm in the habit of not taking calls on this show, and then on the other one, I can just take them when I, or maybe it's because they're in my control panel and I see them all.
[02:34:39.736 --> 02:34:41.458]  But, uh, that is coming up.
[02:34:42.253 --> 02:34:44.234]  And there's video of all this.
[02:34:44.234 --> 02:34:52.538]  If you have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, you can see the archives of these, of the fourth hour every day, or the fifth hour some days.
[02:34:52.538 --> 02:34:58.481]  You can also listen to the audio archive of it.
[02:34:58.481 --> 02:34:59.322]  You can watch it live.
[02:34:59.322 --> 02:35:02.243]  There's a document cam, a video feed, so much more.
[02:35:02.243 --> 02:35:03.003]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:03.003 --> 02:35:04.844]  It takes about a minute to sign up.
[02:35:04.844 --> 02:35:10.067]  It's $5.95 a month for a trial membership, or get a yearly membership and get three months free today.
[02:35:11.041 --> 02:35:12.301]  Now, I haven't plugged sponsors today.
[02:35:12.301 --> 02:35:18.703]  I'm going to plug sponsors, then I'm going to just end the show taking your calls, the official three-hour transmission on Genesis.
[02:35:18.703 --> 02:35:28.085]  And then I'm going to go into overtime with a fourth hour, and then we're going to go into super sudden death overtime into a fifth hour of radio!
[02:35:28.085 --> 02:35:30.065]  Ha ha!
[02:35:30.065 --> 02:35:31.926]  I like it!
[02:35:31.926 --> 02:35:34.486]  Maybe I'll go to five o'clock, six o'clock.
[02:35:34.486 --> 02:35:36.927]  Maybe I'll just filibuster.
[02:35:36.927 --> 02:35:37.867]  You know, I could go for the
[02:35:39.488 --> 02:35:42.509]  Guinness Book of World Records filibuster.
[02:35:42.509 --> 02:35:44.690]  I think in Congress it's like three days.
[02:35:44.690 --> 02:35:50.071]  I could do a radio filibuster.
[02:35:50.071 --> 02:35:52.072]  And how do you want to bet I wouldn't lean on the callers?
[02:35:52.072 --> 02:35:54.693]  You know, most talk shows can't even do an hour and they've got to lean on callers.
[02:35:54.693 --> 02:35:56.513]  Not me!
[02:35:56.513 --> 02:36:00.775]  I'm the mouth from the South, as they say.
[02:36:00.775 --> 02:36:04.536]  Okay, I'm going to go back to your calls here in a moment.
[02:36:04.536 --> 02:36:07.957]  First off, I want to tell you about the fine folks at InnerFood.
[02:36:09.244 --> 02:36:17.591]  And if you go to InfoWars.com, you can link through on the banner to Inner Health Botanicals and get 10% off by going to that Alex Jones subpage.
[02:36:17.591 --> 02:36:25.237]  They have all the products there, the healthy coffees, the healthy Cocos, their original inner food, the 20 superfoods, raw unpasteurized superfoods.
[02:36:25.237 --> 02:36:26.878]  You get full absorption of the vitamins.
[02:36:26.878 --> 02:36:28.600]  This is the one way to really
[02:36:29.581 --> 02:36:36.924]  Take your mainline vitamins and nutrients and minerals and trace elements and ring structures and things like that.
[02:36:36.924 --> 02:36:39.225]  ENERFOOD.COM or give them a call.
[02:36:39.225 --> 02:36:44.927]  Tell them Alex Jones is sending you over the 10% off.
[02:36:44.927 --> 02:36:47.248]  866-762-9238, 866-762-9238 or ENERFOOD.COM.
[02:36:47.248 --> 02:36:52.289]  Dulse, kelp, barley grass, wheat grass, chlorella, spirulina.
[02:36:52.289 --> 02:36:55.991]  People run out of it here at the office and they'll come over to somebody else's stash and try to head them up for it.
[02:36:57.054 --> 02:37:00.217]  Derek was in there the other day over to Rob going, hey, give me some of your inner food, man.
[02:37:00.217 --> 02:37:00.477]  I ran out.
[02:37:00.477 --> 02:37:05.001]  You can also buy it at places like Brave New Books here in Austin, Texas.
[02:37:05.001 --> 02:37:08.704]  But if you buy in bulk, you get an additional 20% off on top of the 10% off.
[02:37:08.704 --> 02:37:13.809]  So 1-866-762-9238 or innerfood.com.
[02:37:13.809 --> 02:37:18.593]  And then, of course, there is also Aloe Ease from the folks at New Vitality, Aloe Vera.
[02:37:18.593 --> 02:37:22.997]  I was listening to Dr. Dina Dell, who hates vitamins and nutrients and minerals this weekend.
[02:37:23.678 --> 02:37:26.220]  And heard him saying aloe vera does clean out your guts.
[02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:31.343]  Wow, even Dr. Dean has to admit that!
[02:37:31.343 --> 02:37:36.567]  New vitality, aloe-ease, colon cleanse, really flushes, detoxes.
[02:37:36.567 --> 02:37:39.589]  That's one of the biggest areas where these toxins and stuff builds up.
[02:37:39.589 --> 02:37:40.850]  I don't want to get into details.
[02:37:40.850 --> 02:37:42.431]  I'm sure you know about it.
[02:37:42.431 --> 02:37:44.413]  But 800-569-4056.
[02:37:44.413 --> 02:37:45.333]  800-569-4056.
[02:37:45.333 --> 02:37:52.178]  They also have the great Super Beta Prostate Formula, well known to shrink and give you better prostate health.
[02:37:52.178 --> 02:37:52.218]  800-569-4056.
[02:37:53.858 --> 02:37:55.398]  40, 56.
[02:37:55.398 --> 02:37:58.519]  And, uh, last but not least, eFoods Direct.
[02:37:58.519 --> 02:38:02.360]  eFoods Direct is the longest continually operating verbal foods company in the nation.
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:03.780]  I don't know if we're gonna have martial law.
[02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:07.021]  They're just geared up for it.
[02:38:07.021 --> 02:38:11.762]  I don't know if we're gonna have food shortages, even though they've started, and rationing has started, of certain key things.
[02:38:11.762 --> 02:38:12.962]  Rationing to the factories.
[02:38:12.962 --> 02:38:15.703]  That is, just certain things you won't want won't be on the shelves.
[02:38:15.703 --> 02:38:17.343]  There'll still be other foods.
[02:38:17.343 --> 02:38:20.184]  I'm not saying we're all gonna be starving in the streets, but the prices are exploding.
[02:38:20.184 --> 02:38:20.964]  Depression could come.
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:22.301]  It certainly could happen.
[02:38:22.301 --> 02:38:22.661]  I don't know.
[02:38:22.661 --> 02:38:24.302]  It's just smart to... I'll tell you this.
[02:38:24.302 --> 02:38:28.025]  I got like five years of food, okay?
[02:38:28.025 --> 02:38:28.845]  That's not really true.
[02:38:28.845 --> 02:38:34.189]  I guess if I got five people in my family now, I've got about two years supply.
[02:38:34.189 --> 02:38:34.850]  Gotta get more.
[02:38:34.850 --> 02:38:38.272]  1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or eFoodsDirect.com, Giant Banners, TheTopOfInfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:38:38.272 --> 02:38:39.373]  Harry in Mississippi about waking up
[02:38:50.066 --> 02:38:53.227]  Mason, let's go ahead and finish up.
[02:38:53.227 --> 02:38:56.729]  I'll make it real short.
[02:38:56.729 --> 02:39:01.531]  It just bothers me that these people are in the dark.
[02:39:01.531 --> 02:39:09.935]  They need to open their eyes and see what the heck they're belonging to and what's going on for thousands of years and the part that they're being played.
[02:39:09.935 --> 02:39:14.417]  They're puppets and they're being used.
[02:39:14.417 --> 02:39:15.818]  That's the bottom line.
[02:39:15.818 --> 02:39:18.899]  I know some great people belonging to the Masonic Order.
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:24.901]  And I know some that I wouldn't give a drop of water if they were drying in thirst.
[02:39:24.901 --> 02:39:26.882]  And that's just about it.
[02:39:26.882 --> 02:39:33.223]  America's got to wake up and find out who the heck is running this country, and it sure as heck isn't us.
[02:39:33.223 --> 02:39:38.944]  Look, let's just make it real simple, and I appreciate your fine points, Harry.
[02:39:38.944 --> 02:39:41.384]  It's a gang.
[02:39:41.384 --> 02:39:44.025]  Especially in small towns.
[02:39:44.025 --> 02:39:47.286]  They give each other business.
[02:39:47.286 --> 02:39:49.026]  If one of them gets caught doing something wrong,
[02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:54.933]  And it's the guy from the Mason Hall, the cop lets him go when he's totally drunk.
[02:39:54.933 --> 02:39:56.674]  But the rest of us, they don't.
[02:39:56.674 --> 02:40:01.918]  And I've told the story of my dad's great-uncle, who I got to know, but he died when I was five.
[02:40:01.918 --> 02:40:09.783]  Uncle Houston, who'd run speakeasies in Houston, and run away from home when he was 13, but on a steamship around the world to come back.
[02:40:09.783 --> 02:40:15.867]  You know, he was a rough guy, run speakeasies all over Houston.
[02:40:15.867 --> 02:40:19.129]  Guys tried to rob him, he killed two of them, they still had him up on, uh,
[02:40:19.844 --> 02:40:20.404]  We're good to go.
[02:40:50.819 --> 02:40:57.305]  And it's come out in the BBC, London Telegraph, the Scotsman, that basically all, I mean, 99% of the barristers, the judges are Masons.
[02:40:57.305 --> 02:41:01.288]  They can do no wrong.
[02:41:01.288 --> 02:41:05.612]  So it's like thousand-year-old Crip or Blood gangs.
[02:41:05.612 --> 02:41:10.596]  You know, I'm sure they'll be in big mansions so they didn't fall apart and be having secret handshakes.
[02:41:10.596 --> 02:41:12.318]  That's what Skull and Bones is.
[02:41:12.318 --> 02:41:14.760]  There was an anti-Masonic party under John Quincy Adams.
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:15.701]  They banned it.
[02:41:15.701 --> 02:41:18.103]  They ran Masons out because they'd been caught killing a bunch of people.
[02:41:19.994 --> 02:41:22.355]  Who'd bend masons and blown the whistle.
[02:41:22.355 --> 02:41:24.997]  They were trying to take the government back over for themselves.
[02:41:24.997 --> 02:41:27.839]  And they banned masons and ran them out of the country.
[02:41:27.839 --> 02:41:30.360]  And then the German and British got real mad.
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:39.585]  The British East India Company, with opium money, this is in the encyclopedia, founded, with opium money, the Skull and Bones.
[02:41:39.585 --> 02:41:47.810]  And all of that stuff, you know, they say, oh well our first level mockument sacrifices of Hiram Abiff and we simulate his killing and then his resurrection and all this stuff.
[02:41:48.996 --> 02:42:03.361]  But when you get up in the higher levels, it is just, you know, then it's black magic, and then above that it's worshipping angels, and, you know, it's worshipping, you know, lower level before that, it's worshipping goddesses and gods.
[02:42:03.361 --> 02:42:08.563]  And, you know, Diana, Eulogia.
[02:42:08.563 --> 02:42:10.043]  And that's how these occult things work.
[02:42:10.043 --> 02:42:12.504]  They then incorporate all sorts of other things.
[02:42:12.504 --> 02:42:18.706]  I mean, they'll have... I didn't see it while I was there inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:42:21.189 --> 02:42:28.633]  Because it's a 2,700 acre Redwood Grove, and I was in the gorge.
[02:42:28.633 --> 02:42:35.877]  I probably saw 300, 400 acres, and that's walking, trying not to be talked to, trying to, having security ask me questions.
[02:42:35.877 --> 02:42:44.482]  We finally got behind a, it's all on video, it's in the film, we finally kind of got to a deserted camp and just sat there on a bench behind some bushes until the sun went down.
[02:42:44.482 --> 02:42:46.003]  We went and got the ritual on tape and got out of there.
[02:42:46.818 --> 02:42:54.202]  Well, in the Grove, you published on your website a photo of some Catholic Saint.
[02:42:54.202 --> 02:43:00.526]  And you didn't talk about that, but I learned about it on your website when you got their annals and scanned a bunch of pages in.
[02:43:00.526 --> 02:43:01.467]  You're covering it up!
[02:43:01.467 --> 02:43:02.287]  It's on your website!
[02:43:02.287 --> 02:43:04.868]  And I'm like... And you're covering it up!
[02:43:04.868 --> 02:43:11.873]  You have Daniel Estillan saying the Vatican's involved at the highest levels with the Black nobility and the New World Order, but it's on your website!
[02:43:11.873 --> 02:43:14.334]  But you covered it up!
[02:43:14.334 --> 02:43:15.194]  You're involved in it!
[02:43:17.327 --> 02:43:19.228]  And again, it isn't about defending me.
[02:43:19.228 --> 02:43:21.170]  I don't care when people attack me.
[02:43:21.170 --> 02:43:30.736]  It's painful that they mean well, they really believe what they're saying, and they really think they've caught the bad guy.
[02:43:30.736 --> 02:43:33.118]  And it never makes any sense.
[02:43:33.118 --> 02:43:35.319]  I'm gonna talk more about that in the fourth hour.
[02:43:35.319 --> 02:43:43.545]  I have no idea what I'll talk about in the fifth hour today when I'm on National British Radio.
[02:43:43.545 --> 02:43:45.686]  Yesterday, I went for an hour and 24 minutes extra.
[02:43:45.686 --> 02:43:46.367]  I did four hours
[02:43:47.253 --> 02:43:56.260]  Twenty-four minutes yesterday, and I guess today I'm going to do five hours.
[02:43:56.260 --> 02:43:59.102]  I love it!
[02:43:59.102 --> 02:44:00.503]  And I'm not going to do the interview of the Brits.
[02:44:00.503 --> 02:44:01.564]  Don't let me simulcast it.
[02:44:01.564 --> 02:44:03.826]  I'm sure they will.
[02:44:03.826 --> 02:44:11.352]  They'd be stupid if they didn't, but it'll be me interviewing them, them interviewing me.
[02:44:11.352 --> 02:44:12.833]  Because I'm doing five hours today.
[02:44:15.768 --> 02:44:17.249]  I could go a couple more hours, I guess.
[02:44:17.249 --> 02:44:18.330]  Okay, I need to shut up.
[02:44:18.330 --> 02:44:19.831]  I got a lot of news, a lot of stuff to cover.
[02:44:19.831 --> 02:44:21.712]  I need to get geared up for the next hour.
[02:44:21.712 --> 02:44:25.274]  All fired up for that, and I said I'd be taking your calls right now, and I'm not.
[02:44:25.274 --> 02:44:34.200]  Oh, by the way, next hour, if folks want to call in, the phone number for you to call in is 512-646-5400.
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:37.563]  And I'm just going to start the show with 20 phone calls in a row.
[02:44:41.693 --> 02:44:42.734]  And I actually did that yesterday.
[02:44:42.734 --> 02:44:43.254]  512-646-5400.
[02:44:43.254 --> 02:44:47.616]  Most of you got unlimited long distance.
[02:44:47.616 --> 02:44:49.097]  We'll have a 1-800 number for you soon.
[02:44:49.097 --> 02:44:50.317]  It'll probably just be the network number.
[02:44:50.317 --> 02:44:50.697]  Who knows?
[02:44:50.697 --> 02:44:51.338]  1-800-646-5400.
[02:44:51.338 --> 02:45:02.623]  T-minus 15 minutes until transmission of hour 4 and video feed if you're a presentplanet.tv member.
[02:45:02.623 --> 02:45:07.445]  Right now in the document feed, I have a barbecue sandwich laying there.
[02:45:07.445 --> 02:45:10.327]  That is the document of the day.
[02:45:10.327 --> 02:45:10.747]  Oh, man.
[02:45:12.558 --> 02:45:15.099]  Jason, you're just an unbelievable trooper in Arizona.
[02:45:15.099 --> 02:45:15.660]  You're on the air.
[02:45:15.660 --> 02:45:17.320]  You get a gold star.
[02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:18.981]  Thank you very much.
[02:45:18.981 --> 02:45:20.962]  I just wanted to make a comment about Barack Obama.
[02:45:20.962 --> 02:45:30.026]  I've heard you say a couple times in the last month or so that Barack Obama is the best of the worst, but... I'm not voting for him.
[02:45:30.026 --> 02:45:33.207]  I'm saying he doesn't have a bunch of murders under his belt.
[02:45:33.207 --> 02:45:34.448]  He doesn't like the Clintons.
[02:45:34.448 --> 02:45:35.648]  I mean, I hate the Clintons.
[02:45:35.648 --> 02:45:37.269]  I know they're wicked.
[02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:39.450]  They have become older and eviler.
[02:45:39.450 --> 02:45:41.131]  And I was saying that
[02:45:41.997 --> 02:45:44.279]  I'm not interrupting, I'm just trying to be clear on what I'm saying here.
[02:45:44.279 --> 02:45:49.943]  And we know that John McCain is totally evil, so I'm saying he's got evil people behind him.
[02:45:49.943 --> 02:45:51.184]  Go ahead.
[02:45:51.184 --> 02:45:53.966]  Absolutely, and I know you feel that way.
[02:45:53.966 --> 02:45:56.247]  I just wanted to make one quick correction.
[02:45:56.247 --> 02:46:00.330]  You've said a couple times that at least Barack Obama voted against the war.
[02:46:00.330 --> 02:46:04.854]  Actually, Barack Obama didn't get elected to the Senate until 2004.
[02:46:04.854 --> 02:46:08.276]  But he did vote against funding when all the rest of them did vote for it.
[02:46:08.276 --> 02:46:10.798]  Well, he did, but that's sort of a vote of
[02:46:11.536 --> 02:46:14.338]  You know, of no consequence, because he knows it's going to pass anyway.
[02:46:14.338 --> 02:46:30.427]  So I think the media has spawned him as the anti-war candidate, and it's interesting that MSNBC really seems to be the Barack Obama station, and it's pretty clear that, you know... Well, that's because they know he's hot and has a lot of charisma, and so they're pushing him.
[02:46:30.427 --> 02:46:35.050]  Absolutely, and I think the other element to that is that they're owned by General Electric,
[02:46:35.695 --> 02:46:41.556]  And Barack Obama gets more money from the nuclear industry than any of the other candidates.
[02:46:41.556 --> 02:46:41.956]  That's right.
[02:46:41.956 --> 02:46:44.717]  He's promised to give them hundreds of billions.
[02:46:44.717 --> 02:46:45.197]  Great points.
[02:46:45.197 --> 02:46:46.837]  Anything else?
[02:46:46.837 --> 02:46:48.298]  No, I just enjoy your show.
[02:46:48.298 --> 02:46:50.238]  I'm a first-time caller and I'll let someone else get on.
[02:46:50.238 --> 02:46:50.878]  I appreciate it.
[02:46:50.878 --> 02:46:52.659]  Well, you don't normally have to hold an hour to get on.
[02:46:52.659 --> 02:46:55.359]  I've just been out of control today.
[02:46:55.359 --> 02:46:57.840]  My pleasure to be on your show and it's really a privilege.
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:00.500]  Well, it's my pleasure to take your call, sir.
[02:47:00.500 --> 02:47:02.020]  Let's talk to Kevin in Montana.
[02:47:02.020 --> 02:47:04.141]  You're on the air, Kev.
[02:47:04.141 --> 02:47:04.381]  Hello.
[02:47:04.997 --> 02:47:06.765]  Hello, Admiral.
[02:47:06.765 --> 02:47:08.934]  Sir Alejandro, um...
[02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:10.370]  My name is Kevin.
[02:47:10.370 --> 02:47:14.252]  I'm calling from Minnesota, the state of where Jesse Ventura... Okay, Minnesota.
[02:47:14.252 --> 02:47:14.852]  I thought Montana.
[02:47:14.852 --> 02:47:15.633]  Go ahead.
[02:47:15.633 --> 02:47:16.093]  No.
[02:47:16.093 --> 02:47:21.235]  And the reason why I'm calling is that I'm a veteran with the alleged Gulf War illness.
[02:47:21.235 --> 02:47:30.179]  After learning about the atrocities that they used me as a guinea pig, I started bringing forth and trying to inform the general public about Gulf War illness.
[02:47:30.179 --> 02:47:38.122]  And at the time, Jesse Ventura was doing a radio station, and this was just before he went in to be in the Mayor of Brooklyn Park.
[02:47:39.316 --> 02:47:41.497]  He made a couple comments about Gulf War illness.
[02:47:41.497 --> 02:47:49.560]  I used that as an opportunity to get him numerous amounts of information and videos pertaining to Gulf War illness.
[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:52.201]  He said, yeah, I was in the military.
[02:47:52.201 --> 02:47:53.682]  We had Agent Orange.
[02:47:53.682 --> 02:47:55.243]  He never was a Navy SEAL.
[02:47:55.243 --> 02:47:59.464]  He trained with the Navy SEALs, so that's a false statement that he made.
[02:47:59.464 --> 02:48:01.265]  Because the Neocon website says that?
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:04.481]  No, I'm just saying that from finding that information.
[02:48:04.481 --> 02:48:08.744]  No, no, that was actually investigated by national television and that's not true.
[02:48:08.744 --> 02:48:12.726]  He was first in the underwater demolition corps and then he was in the Navy SEALs.
[02:48:12.726 --> 02:48:15.487]  Well, that's the training with Navy SEALs is underwater demolition corps.
[02:48:15.487 --> 02:48:17.588]  No, no, he was first in that.
[02:48:17.588 --> 02:48:18.929]  Do you have any points to make, sir?
[02:48:18.929 --> 02:48:20.930]  Are you just going to talk about Jesse Ventura?
[02:48:20.930 --> 02:48:21.891]  That's fine if you want to.
[02:48:21.891 --> 02:48:27.654]  Okay, well, I used that as an opportunity to give him a bunch of information pertaining to Gulf War illness.
[02:48:27.654 --> 02:48:29.454]  He said, yeah, he's on board and stuff.
[02:48:31.124 --> 02:48:38.428]  Um, when he became governor, I asked him also what he was going to do for the Minnesota veterans that have Gulf War illness.
[02:48:38.428 --> 02:48:52.014]  And then I got to the point of where I rode my wheelchair across the state of Minnesota because of Gulf War illness and trying to bring awareness, where I gave him numerous letters, certified letters.
[02:48:52.014 --> 02:48:55.216]  He promised me that he would meet me at the end of my ride.
[02:48:55.216 --> 02:48:56.717]  It took me 11 days.
[02:48:57.845 --> 02:49:03.113]  Of over 15 hours a day to ride my wheelchair across the state of Minnesota.
[02:49:03.113 --> 02:49:11.565]  When I got there at the Capitol, he didn't have the gumption even to send any representatives from his office.
[02:49:11.565 --> 02:49:13.648]  Jesse Ventura is a snake in the grass.
[02:49:14.301 --> 02:49:19.425]  When the people of Brooklyn Park got him in there, they were waiting to get him out.
[02:49:19.425 --> 02:49:25.950]  He lied to the people, he lied to the college students, claiming all of these promises and that it never did anything.
[02:49:25.950 --> 02:49:28.592]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:49:28.592 --> 02:49:35.398]  I'm really sorry that he didn't meet you outside and I'm really sorry that he didn't give you enough attention.
[02:49:35.398 --> 02:49:40.902]  And I have no doubt that Jesse Ventura isn't perfect and I don't completely trust him either.
[02:49:40.902 --> 02:49:42.484]  All I've tried to do is help the
[02:49:43.399 --> 02:49:48.983]  Go for veterans and have guests on to expose it and everything I can in my own meager way.
[02:49:48.983 --> 02:49:55.126]  You know, I have given tens of thousands of dollars quietly to the 9-11 victims.
[02:49:55.126 --> 02:49:59.189]  I haven't really talked about that, but I think I might just go ahead and do it.
[02:49:59.189 --> 02:50:03.692]  Because then I get these idiot emails about, why don't you help the 9-11 people?
[02:50:03.692 --> 02:50:08.695]  And then even after I've given some of the victims money, they still gripe and complain and kind of have this, I'm owed something.
[02:50:08.695 --> 02:50:10.076]  Look, I didn't do anything to you.
[02:50:12.762 --> 02:50:19.106]  Jesse Ventura... I'll never forget, a lady got really mad at me once when Jeb Bush was governor.
[02:50:19.106 --> 02:50:28.911]  I get this really mad email and she says, you didn't email me back, but Governor Bush did.
[02:50:28.911 --> 02:50:34.294]  And then she even called the show and I said, ma'am, that isn't really from the governor.
[02:50:34.294 --> 02:50:35.975]  That's someone saying they're from the governor.
[02:50:35.975 --> 02:50:38.637]  She said, no, it's him and you didn't email me back.
[02:50:38.637 --> 02:50:41.539]  Do you know what it's like to be busy?
[02:50:41.539 --> 02:50:42.019]  I mean, you know,
[02:50:43.954 --> 02:50:45.257]  I'm sure he got covered up.
[02:50:45.257 --> 02:50:49.266]  That's just not fair to say he's all these bad things because he didn't meet you.
[02:50:49.266 --> 02:50:50.669]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:50.669 --> 02:50:53.515]  A new world order.
[02:50:53.515 --> 02:50:54.437]  In the near future.
[02:50:55.313 --> 02:50:58.377]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:50:58.377 --> 02:51:01.220]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:04.004]  Put their objective being world domination.
[02:51:04.004 --> 02:51:07.188]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:07.188 --> 02:51:14.516]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:17.540 --> 02:51:22.984]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:22.984 --> 02:51:26.846]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:26.846 --> 02:51:29.408]  Build America is making great progress for the world.
[02:51:29.408 --> 02:51:30.589]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:30.589 --> 02:51:31.369]  They're not after money.
[02:51:31.369 --> 02:51:32.630]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:32.630 --> 02:51:33.631]  They're after power.
[02:51:33.631 --> 02:51:34.772]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[02:51:34.772 --> 02:51:43.497]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:43.497 --> 02:51:46.299]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:51:46.299 --> 02:51:47.360]  You have been warned.
[02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:48.861]  Greetings!
[02:51:48.861 --> 02:51:52.502]  I am Dr. Buell Von Scheidt with the White Paper Chronicles.
[02:51:52.502 --> 02:52:01.167]  Mr. Steve Schenk with this Fearless Radio program is correct when he says the solution to our difficult times is to store food and get healthy.
[02:52:01.167 --> 02:52:04.568]  My comrades and I of the media don't want you to panic.
[02:52:04.568 --> 02:52:11.552]  We, unlike Fearless Radio, try not to tell you about the food control legislation, Hurricane Katrina, the American famine,
[02:52:11.792 --> 02:52:13.793]  Families unable to buy food.
[02:52:13.793 --> 02:52:21.999]  If we told you the solution to all these problems is food, you'd panic and run out and buy a food before it disappeared, or you couldn't afford it.
[02:52:21.999 --> 02:52:28.504]  You'd completely mess up the perfect strategy for population control, and they'd kick us out of the Survivors Club.
[02:52:28.504 --> 02:52:33.508]  You are a sissy chicken if you call JMSEFoodsDirect.com and order food.
[02:52:33.948 --> 02:52:35.009]  This is Steve.
[02:52:35.009 --> 02:52:40.592]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:52:40.592 --> 02:52:41.192]  800-409-5633.
[02:52:41.192 --> 02:52:48.836]  You'll be considered a little bit crazy, but there's no such thing as a little bit dead.
[02:52:48.836 --> 02:52:50.037]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:52:50.037 --> 02:52:52.118]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:52:52.532 --> 02:52:55.573]  Allison's Natural Antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:52:55.573 --> 02:52:56.333]  is the real thing.
[02:52:56.333 --> 02:53:03.315]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:53:03.315 --> 02:53:14.338]  Allison molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[02:53:14.338 --> 02:53:17.499]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies,
[02:53:17.759 --> 02:53:18.340]  We're good to go.
[02:54:00.816 --> 02:54:10.821]  We're only seven minutes away from hour number four.
[02:54:10.821 --> 02:54:23.007]  And then hour number five as I simulcast on national English radio.
[02:54:23.007 --> 02:54:28.710]  They're only live once, might as well hit them as hard as you can.
[02:54:33.632 --> 02:54:38.734]  You're welcome to call in in the next hour and the hour after that at 512-646-5400.
[02:54:38.734 --> 02:54:50.679]  We're going to write to your calls after a five-minute video intro as PrisonPlanet.tv members watch on the video cam.
[02:54:50.679 --> 02:54:53.640]  Go to the main page, click through, put in your access code, and you're in.
[02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:57.422]  Or everybody can listen on the streams at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:59.335 --> 02:55:02.337]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio, then Stan and Susan.
[02:55:02.337 --> 02:55:03.457]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:55:03.457 --> 02:55:04.458]  Go ahead.
[02:55:04.458 --> 02:55:05.278]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:55:05.278 --> 02:55:11.442]  It's hard this time of year not to think about our dear departed friend, Mr. Aaron Russo, especially during tax time.
[02:55:11.442 --> 02:55:12.783]  I have one quick question about him.
[02:55:12.783 --> 02:55:15.705]  Is his website still up, the freedomtofashion.com?
[02:55:15.705 --> 02:55:16.405]  Well, have you checked it?
[02:55:16.405 --> 02:55:16.925]  Yeah, it's up.
[02:55:16.925 --> 02:55:18.326]  I was on there like a week ago.
[02:55:18.326 --> 02:55:20.407]  Okay, I had no way of checking it.
[02:55:20.407 --> 02:55:28.432]  And then, of course, it came out there was some in the LA Times and New York Times, a murder plot against him with Pelicano, the famous private investigator.
[02:55:29.757 --> 02:55:30.678]  Did you see that?
[02:55:30.678 --> 02:55:32.959]  No sir, I did not.
[02:55:32.959 --> 02:55:33.599]  You know what?
[02:55:33.599 --> 02:55:35.020]  I never even really talked about that.
[02:55:35.020 --> 02:55:36.721]  I'm going to cover that next hour.
[02:55:36.721 --> 02:55:39.303]  Charlton Heston's pro-gun stances.
[02:55:39.303 --> 02:55:41.904]  Some Charlton Heston clips I haven't gotten to.
[02:55:41.904 --> 02:55:49.609]  Also, Israel's top rabbi says that one Jew is worth 1,000 people.
[02:55:49.609 --> 02:55:51.210]  That's what Nazis said.
[02:55:51.210 --> 02:55:54.392]  And I really have to decry that racism.
[02:55:54.392 --> 02:55:56.493]  But it is being decried by Israeli papers.
[02:55:56.493 --> 02:55:57.474]  So that's a good thing.
[02:55:57.474 --> 02:55:57.914]  Anything else?
[02:55:58.380 --> 02:56:02.682]  Oh yeah, real quick, what did you think of that absolute vodka ad with the Azatlan picture?
[02:56:02.682 --> 02:56:21.592]  We did cover it, and they've now apologized, and they said, look, our marketing shows, that's what the majority of people in Mexico think, and it's real popular down there, and they said in England they ran an ad showing the 13 colonies being part of England again, so it's just, you know, they're just advertising to what their market is, which is a big wake-up call to people.
[02:56:23.010 --> 02:56:31.317]  I'll never, you know, and to those occasionally that responsibly have a cocktail, I used to have Absolut and OJ, never again.
[02:56:31.317 --> 02:56:42.407]  Well, I'm a tea-toddler, at least for now, so won't be a problem, but I'd actually do like vodka, and I guarantee I'll never, I won't be at some party two years from now and have one drink and I'll say, is this Absolut vodka?
[02:56:42.407 --> 02:56:43.688]  No, I'm not drinking it.
[02:56:43.688 --> 02:56:45.570]  But it's better not to drink anyways.
[02:56:45.570 --> 02:56:47.712]  Hey, good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:56:47.712 --> 02:56:47.952]  Listen,
[02:56:48.757 --> 02:56:50.658]  I don't want to be rude to Stan and Susan.
[02:56:50.658 --> 02:56:59.580]  If you'll call in, I'll go to you first at 512-646-5400, because I don't want to be... John, will you give him that number and have him call that right now?
[02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:01.101]  I'll go to him right when we come out of break.
[02:57:01.101 --> 02:57:03.062]  Immediately.
[02:57:03.062 --> 02:57:06.683]  At 512-646-5400.
[02:57:06.683 --> 02:57:15.426]  Because when we start the fourth hour, I don't want to cheat you out of time right now with like two minutes left.
[02:57:15.426 --> 02:57:16.506]  I want to be able to
[02:57:17.648 --> 02:57:31.737]  Give you time and then we're gonna give you time and then I'm gonna since they held so long I'm gonna go to give them a while then I'm gonna blast through all the other callers just call after call after call after call when we start this hour and we're turning the phone system on right now so you can call 512-646-5400
[02:57:36.223 --> 02:57:37.444]  Now let me explain how this works.
[02:57:37.444 --> 02:57:39.505]  There's only one place to get the show.
[02:57:39.505 --> 02:57:41.567]  In a few weeks it's going to be on Genesis.
[02:57:41.567 --> 02:57:43.168]  On the satellite, shortwave, all of it.
[02:57:43.168 --> 02:57:45.029]  Oh, I forgot they had to call and get shortwave for it.
[02:57:45.029 --> 02:57:46.370]  But we'll get on that now.
[02:57:46.370 --> 02:57:47.811]  They're in the five minute break we're about to have.
[02:57:47.811 --> 02:57:49.652]  We're going to play a video clip.
[02:57:49.652 --> 02:57:50.233]  And then we'll, uh...
[02:57:51.297 --> 02:57:52.218]  Come back, go to your calls.
[02:57:52.218 --> 02:57:54.701]  I'm going to call and make sure we get that hour shortwave for you.
[02:57:54.701 --> 02:57:56.823]  Shortwave listeners, we're thinking about you.
[02:57:56.823 --> 02:58:00.807]  And then, of course, we'll be up on the satellite soon for our Eminem affiliates who are chomping at the bit.
[02:58:00.807 --> 02:58:01.568]  We're thankful for that.
[02:58:01.568 --> 02:58:02.509]  Pick up the show.
[02:58:02.509 --> 02:58:05.653]  But the internet feed is available and free to everyone.
