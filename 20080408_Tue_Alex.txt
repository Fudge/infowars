[00:50.260 --> 00:54.360]  now taking on a fourth hour of syndicated radio but for the next few
[00:54.360 --> 00:57.860]  weeks for the time being you will hear the fourth hour basically commercial
[00:57.860 --> 01:04.860]  free as we develop and hone the fourth hour it will have live video feeds on
[01:04.860 --> 01:09.660]  myself my guest in studio a document cam a video feed where I can play video
[01:09.660 --> 01:15.220]  clips and audio clips a computer screen feed and much much more and then we're
[01:15.220 --> 01:19.900]  going to be taking these feeds every day after the show within a couple hours and
[01:19.900 --> 01:25.380]  posting that fourth hour up on prison planet dot TV for prison planet dot
[01:25.380 --> 01:29.980]  TV members who may not have had a chance to watch the fourth hour as it
[01:29.980 --> 01:34.140]  streamed now of course everybody can listen for free to the internet audio of
[01:34.140 --> 01:40.460]  the fourth hour so for now it is a internet radio show in the fourth hour
[01:40.460 --> 01:45.020]  we already had three affiliates call yesterday when I mentioned we're gonna
[01:45.020 --> 01:51.300]  have a fourth hour call and say that they want the fourth hour and so yes you
[01:51.300 --> 01:56.100]  will hear the fourth hour on the GCN radio network a few weeks down the road
[01:56.100 --> 02:03.500]  but right now we are beta testing this fourth hour live and let me tell you I
[02:03.500 --> 02:09.580]  went wild yesterday in the fourth hour I went even over I did one hour and 24
[02:09.580 --> 02:14.980]  minutes extra so four hours and 24 minute radio show yesterday but I'm gonna
[02:14.980 --> 02:20.380]  control myself in the future it's it's going to be a four hour radio show I
[02:20.380 --> 02:25.500]  can't turn it into a four and a half a five a six hour radio show and I dig a
[02:25.500 --> 02:29.980]  little wild on the show yesterday making some to think that this is going to be
[02:29.980 --> 02:35.540]  some type of Howard Sternian type fourth hour it's not and I apologize for my
[02:35.540 --> 02:40.740]  behavior I have to be honest with you when I'm eating five huge meals a day
[02:40.740 --> 02:43.900]  and drinking a few beers at night and smoking a pack of cigarettes a day I'm
[02:43.900 --> 02:50.220]  more relaxed and docile but I haven't worked out like this in ten years and
[02:50.220 --> 02:54.980]  I've been running twice a day some days lifting weights swimming and I'm totally
[02:54.980 --> 02:58.500]  addicted now I finally got back into the addiction mode of working out I'm
[02:58.500 --> 03:02.700]  losing about two pounds a day I'm completely crazed and I probably
[03:02.700 --> 03:07.860]  shouldn't even be on radio I mean normally somebody can flip me off in
[03:07.860 --> 03:11.500]  traffic and I don't even care a couple days ago it was like I was a teenager
[03:11.500 --> 03:14.860]  again somebody cut me off and flipped me off for no reason and I almost ripped
[03:14.860 --> 03:19.380]  the steering wheel off the column so Lord knows what's what's gonna happen here
[03:19.380 --> 03:23.940]  I've just got to completely control myself I forgot why I don't like being in
[03:23.940 --> 03:29.700]  shape because I like why I like being a happy blob because ladies and gentlemen
[03:29.700 --> 03:34.860]  I'm crazed now I mean you think I'm crazed when I'm in a docile porcine type
[03:34.860 --> 03:41.780]  mode pinniped type mode well this is the old Alex Jones and I'm totally addicted
[03:41.780 --> 03:47.860]  I can't wait to three o'clock to get out of here and go jog I'm so addicted to
[03:47.860 --> 03:51.540]  working out again I just had happened to click about a month and a half ago the

[08:58.700 --> 09:05.980]  we'll cover that homeland spy satellite plan ignores constitution well it's just
[09:05.980 --> 09:09.820]  a gd piece of paper according to Bush foreign banks flee Spanish property
[09:09.820 --> 09:14.540]  debt that's right the mortgage crisis spreads globally US jobless figures the
[09:14.540 --> 09:22.220]  specter of a new depression folks have dug up the transcripts of Charlton
[09:22.220 --> 09:26.660]  Heston on national television supporting the 68 gun control act I've got
[09:26.660 --> 09:31.740]  comments on this and I'm gonna cover it and talk about it today and more on
[09:31.740 --> 09:40.140]  Heston as we remember him this week rabbi says life of one yeshiva boy worth
[09:40.140 --> 09:45.100]  more than a thousand Arabs this is out of wine at news you know last night I
[09:45.100 --> 09:48.340]  sent this to curtain M.O. and Paul Watson and they posted it on info wars
[09:48.340 --> 09:53.980]  dot com and people are in the comments section saying this site better stop
[09:53.980 --> 09:57.780]  this this is anti-semitic they'll think we're all anti-semitic if you post this
[09:57.780 --> 10:06.700]  this is a major Israeli newspaper and magazine this is an Israeli news story
[10:06.700 --> 10:12.940]  okay and and I've protested the Klu Klux Klan I've protested Metro in
[10:12.940 --> 10:18.580]  La Raza and I have always protested the fact that large sectors of the Israeli
[10:18.580 --> 10:30.180]  population openly say that everyone but them are animals and it's very sad to
[10:30.180 --> 10:35.940]  talk about this but I'm going to talk about it and to the people that are so
[10:35.940 --> 10:40.660]  programmed against discussing this we just need to face the facts that most
[10:40.660 --> 10:45.540]  groups are tribal most groups think everybody else is subhuman and this is
[10:45.540 --> 10:51.300]  how the globalist control us and manipulate us and it's just terrible
[10:51.300 --> 10:55.260]  when pastor Hague he says that he rejoices every time he hears about a
[10:55.260 --> 11:01.900]  Palestinian child being killed that's a quote and it's disgusting when they have
[11:01.900 --> 11:06.980]  televised programs in Israel or these types of things are said and then we're
[11:06.980 --> 11:13.460]  not supposed to talk about it but it's also distasteful the people that
[11:13.460 --> 11:17.620]  basically say Jews are evil and their own species of evil and then evil comes
[11:17.620 --> 11:22.340]  from Jews only we would have a utopian world system if they didn't exist that
[11:22.340 --> 11:30.900]  is not the case so we'll break that down today just like all Mexicans in the US
[11:30.900 --> 11:34.580]  aren't Larry conquistus saying all whites need to be killed but a large
[11:34.580 --> 11:45.740]  section is and so I'm forced to talk about it and I don't like it but I have
[11:45.740 --> 11:52.980]  to just tell it like it is so I'll talk about race today that is just some of
[11:52.980 --> 11:56.740]  the news that I have here in front of me I never got to this yesterday like I
[11:56.740 --> 12:07.620]  should have web could collapse as video demand sores I want to get into that some
[12:07.620 --> 12:14.740]  today and then they also in that of the same newspaper tell you in relation
[12:14.740 --> 12:18.740]  they have a link to a similar article they wrote days before it says super
[12:18.740 --> 12:22.540]  fast intermittent may replace worldwide web so see oh the web is going to
[12:22.540 --> 12:26.300]  collapse don't worry there's a replacement as I've been telling you for six
[12:26.300 --> 12:29.900]  years now not because I'm smart not because I have a crystal ball I
[12:29.900 --> 12:41.980]  actually read what the industry says here's an example of that hundreds of
[12:41.980 --> 12:46.340]  thousands of business owners and executives you can even own a small
[12:46.340 --> 12:53.580]  business like I do and you get on the CEO and manager list and every day I get
[12:53.580 --> 13:00.980]  magazines like this in the mail I mean every day this stuff comes in and I've
[13:00.980 --> 13:04.300]  been on one of these lists about seven eight years you know this stuff's been
[13:04.300 --> 13:08.500]  coming in since about actually about 99 man how time flies finance and
[13:08.500 --> 13:23.860]  development this is a industry specialist CEO manager specialized type
[13:23.860 --> 13:29.980]  publication the general public doesn't read this global governance and we had
[13:29.980 --> 13:33.860]  this mailed into a solicitor also mailed us a copy of this so somebody else
[13:33.860 --> 13:40.220]  out there saw others was important global governance who is in charge then you
[13:40.220 --> 13:44.420]  read it and they admit we're under global government now that's one thing
[13:44.420 --> 13:49.220]  for those in that they're seen as the establishment the hundred or thousand so
[13:49.220 --> 13:57.180]  small and medium-sized business owners in the US and then you get into more
[13:57.180 --> 14:01.380]  elite publications at the CFR puts out that are public but not highly
[14:01.380 --> 14:05.340]  circulated and it's even worse the things they talk about and then you try to
[14:05.340 --> 14:10.540]  tell the man on the street what's going on they just laugh at you but that's how
[14:10.540 --> 14:17.620]  I knew about internet two six years ago was I was reading internet industry
[14:17.620 --> 14:26.620]  publications and technology publications that were mailed to me because the
[14:26.620 --> 14:29.940]  establishment mails us out to basically anybody that owns a technology company
[14:29.940 --> 14:35.380]  or internet business of any size and it's their PR it's their propaganda it's
[14:35.380 --> 14:39.980]  how great it is oh we're gonna within the next ten years or sooner this is
[14:39.980 --> 14:42.980]  about six years ago shut the internet down this is how we're gonna do it we're
[14:42.980 --> 14:46.820]  gonna force everybody over to it but it's gonna be really profitable for the
[14:46.820 --> 14:50.020]  select few and it's gonna be faster for everybody and you're gonna have your
[14:50.020 --> 14:54.060]  personal computing info the general public will on a remote server and you'll
[14:54.060 --> 14:58.940]  just have a template that dials into it and and everybody's gonna have subdomains
[14:58.940 --> 15:06.420]  on larger 100 domains 50 industry 50 government slash university and then I
[15:06.420 --> 15:11.420]  got I said boy I better go read what internet 2 is so I googled it and found
[15:11.420 --> 15:16.180]  their meetings in Chicago and London and Austin and every year they have them and
[15:16.180 --> 15:19.020]  I and they openly talk about how they're gonna take the internet away from you
[15:19.020 --> 15:22.700]  and it's not gonna be the free internet anymore it's not gonna be what it's been
[15:22.700 --> 15:27.180]  so let me now just briefly break that down then I'm gonna get into Jesse Ventura
[15:27.180 --> 15:31.020]  saying that the American people have a right to armed rebellion against the
[15:31.020 --> 15:36.660]  tyranny of this government which is in the Declaration of Independence and then
[15:36.660 --> 15:41.540]  we're gonna have wide open phones today take a lot of calls in the second third
[15:41.540 --> 15:47.020]  and fourth hour that's right we now do a fourth hour Ted Anderson called me
[15:47.020 --> 15:49.740]  yesterday he said listen I want to put your show on right now on the network in
[15:49.740 --> 15:57.900]  the fourth hour and I said no Ted hold off I just you know I don't even want to
[15:57.900 --> 16:00.780]  step on people's toes if people don't think they need to move their shows up
[16:00.780 --> 16:04.860]  later that's fine in fact I'll just rent a star guide myself or whatever Ted's
[16:04.860 --> 16:10.020]  welcome to run his ads over it or we'll do something like that and I'm kind of
[16:10.020 --> 16:14.140]  having fun I know a lot of stations want it you're gonna get it in fact I just I
[16:14.140 --> 16:18.900]  need to call shortwave and see if they'll pick up the fourth hour WWCR and
[16:18.900 --> 16:23.420]  then that's all gonna come in time but 75% of the public have computers and
[16:23.420 --> 16:28.340]  are connectable and so you can tune into the fourth hour now via info wars.com
[16:28.340 --> 16:34.740]  the streams that are there on the site but Ted is chomping at the bit to get
[16:34.740 --> 16:39.420]  the show he goes no no I'm picking it up I'm gonna I'm like no don't move it Ted
[16:39.420 --> 16:43.740]  just let people figure it out for themselves and I think Deagle's already
[16:43.740 --> 16:48.780]  called up wanting that common sense approach but
[16:51.900 --> 16:57.020]  but again a fourth hour of the radio show ladies and gentlemen with video
[16:57.020 --> 17:01.180]  cams here in studio we beta tested it had a few glitches the first 10 minutes
[17:01.180 --> 17:04.380]  with the video cams but then it was up and running great after that and today's
[17:04.380 --> 17:09.700]  show yesterday show has been up but we haven't posted it yet
[17:09.700 --> 17:15.300]  yesterday show and today show be up this afternoon for you and then five days a
[17:15.300 --> 17:18.700]  week you're gonna have the show up there now a few days a week sometimes
[17:18.700 --> 17:22.260]  sometimes I'll do five days a week some days I'll do three days a week I'd say
[17:22.260 --> 17:26.620]  on average you know I'll probably not do five or six shows a month live in that
[17:26.620 --> 17:31.460]  fourth hour because we're gonna give you special original video never before
[17:31.460 --> 17:35.500]  seen like later this week I'm gonna play just about five ten minutes I'm not
[17:35.500 --> 17:39.740]  sure right now we're editing it together from the upcoming JFK film I'm
[17:39.740 --> 17:46.260]  making you'll have a live sneak peek in that fourth hour man in the web
[17:46.260 --> 17:50.580]  wonderful breaking the monopoly of the big corporations who whose media
[17:50.580 --> 17:54.940]  empires are literally imploding whose news propaganda empires are imploding
[17:54.940 --> 18:00.580]  whose newspaper propaganda empires are falling apart in front of us collapsing
[18:00.580 --> 18:10.460]  as they just keep slipping their lies and it falls flat on their face so what
[18:10.460 --> 18:16.100]  are they gonna do well it's just like what England is doing and now the US and
[18:16.100 --> 18:19.940]  Germany they take an existing road they make you put a transponder in your car
[18:19.940 --> 18:24.500]  and they tax you to drive on the main roads the BBC reported what three days
[18:24.500 --> 18:33.460]  ago that the average cost will be 54 pounds 50 plus pounds per day to drive
[18:33.460 --> 18:37.660]  into London and they said don't worry it's only going to be 20 pounds a day
[18:37.660 --> 18:43.260]  driving in the rest of the country every road will have a transponder on it every
[18:43.260 --> 18:47.540]  car will have it every road you will be taxed and San Francisco was doing this
[18:47.540 --> 18:50.740]  seven years ago they will track everywhere you go with the transponders
[18:50.740 --> 18:53.860]  and now it's coming out all over the country the police are doing that you
[18:53.860 --> 18:56.700]  don't have a cell phone they just dial in and track your transponder from point
[18:56.700 --> 19:03.580]  to point and so they know every 300 400 yards or so where you're at all big
[19:03.580 --> 19:11.940]  brother all Pentagon design and they turn your car into a literal taxi cab the
[19:11.940 --> 19:18.540]  Texas Department of Transportation said three years ago that it will be a hundred
[19:18.540 --> 19:29.940]  and sixty five dollars to drive from Austin to Dallas and back one way I
[19:29.940 --> 19:41.100]  guess would be what's half of 160 something 80 plus dollars and that's
[19:41.100 --> 19:46.180]  just a start oh I'm sorry I was talking about internet but see they all have the
[19:46.180 --> 19:51.860]  same tricks they're gonna put taxes on it kill net neutrality let me tell you

[25:34.300 --> 25:53.980]  Alright, as much as I like it, we've got to cut it out.
[25:53.980 --> 26:00.060]  Coming up, Senator Arland Specter confronted on Magic Bullet Theory.
[26:00.060 --> 26:02.560]  Absolutely amazing when we're playing the audio of that video.
[26:02.560 --> 26:10.700]  This is up on jonesreport.com, we'll be discussing that.
[26:10.700 --> 26:14.460]  Getting back to internet too, I'm going to come back with a Jesse Ventura news, and then
[26:14.460 --> 26:22.060]  of course the new info, secret plans for US troops to stay in Iraq forever, of course
[26:22.060 --> 26:26.140]  we told you about that before the war, but now that's finally breaking into news.
[26:26.140 --> 26:29.900]  Now the media is being allowed to report on all this.
[26:29.900 --> 26:35.500]  I don't know why we could debate that, we could discuss that.
[26:35.500 --> 26:38.700]  Well I do know why to a certain extent.
[26:38.700 --> 26:43.420]  To ask the question is to generally get the answer if you actually think about it.
[26:43.420 --> 26:48.740]  But what they're going to do is a combination of things.
[26:48.740 --> 26:53.580]  There are hundreds of main hubs and switches for the internet, and the internet to people,
[26:53.580 --> 26:57.620]  which is the international private corporations who set the standards and then basically order
[26:57.620 --> 27:00.140]  government to adopt those standards.
[27:00.140 --> 27:04.580]  They have government in the heads of all the fortune, you know, 100 technology companies,
[27:04.580 --> 27:06.580]  they're all there.
[27:06.580 --> 27:11.460]  You can go read the transcripts, the meetings, type in the internet is dead, internet too,
[27:11.460 --> 27:15.140]  they put that announcement out every year, you'll see hundreds of articles with that
[27:15.140 --> 27:20.900]  in the headliner in the story, that's their slogan.
[27:20.900 --> 27:24.580]  And they talk about how they're letting the web grow, how the government created it, now
[27:24.580 --> 27:29.360]  it's the government's right with the elites to take it back over.
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.180]  And they say that they're going to let the hubs break down and fall apart.
[27:34.180 --> 27:39.260]  And that the universities and institutions and government facilities and private corporations
[27:39.260 --> 27:45.020]  that are upkeeping the main hubs are just going to have government change the law where
[27:45.020 --> 27:50.060]  they don't even have to provide connectivity and cross through of data.
[27:50.060 --> 27:53.420]  But they say that's not enough, they're just not going to upgrade them and that it's their
[27:53.420 --> 27:58.460]  right that when that stuff breaks to just not offer it.
[27:58.460 --> 28:01.340]  But they say before they can get to that point, they've got to get internet too up and get
[28:01.340 --> 28:05.460]  more people using it, which they're now doing.
[28:05.460 --> 28:12.140]  And it's hyper fast, I mean, high definition TV, movies, music in, you know, perfect sound
[28:12.140 --> 28:22.540]  quality, live performances, data transmission, just, just, they're working on holograms
[28:22.540 --> 28:26.940]  where somebody's projected to be doing this for decades as a hologram on the desk where
[28:26.940 --> 28:29.500]  you have virtual meetings where everybody's in the room.
[28:29.500 --> 28:30.500]  This is all coming.
[28:30.500 --> 28:37.660]  It's a three camera shoot on a simple computer platform.
[28:37.660 --> 28:41.340]  Movies within about 10 years, you're going to have theaters or sooner nationwide where
[28:41.340 --> 28:44.740]  you go in and it's a 3D hologram movie.
[28:44.740 --> 28:46.540]  That's why you don't ever hear about James Cameron anymore.
[28:46.540 --> 28:53.340]  He took his $5 billion and that's all he works on, all he does 24 seven and I know people
[28:53.340 --> 28:58.300]  that have been inside the secret of areas, not just the public areas, it's unbelievable.
[28:58.300 --> 29:02.300]  It makes the holograms in fiction movies like Star Wars look like child's play.
[29:02.300 --> 29:06.980]  And I remember being a little kid going to Disneyland and going to the haunted house
[29:06.980 --> 29:12.540]  and they had 3D ghost that were 3D flying around.
[29:12.540 --> 29:17.540]  It's 40 year old technology with projectors, but I'm digressing here.
[29:17.540 --> 29:21.340]  So they're going to tantalize you onto the new web where there's, well, I'm going to
[29:21.340 --> 29:22.340]  finish up when we get back.
[29:22.340 --> 29:27.500]  We'll get into Ventura, we'll get into the war, there's just so much and I'm really
[29:27.500 --> 29:34.060]  going to try to cover all the news first today, then take a bunch of your calls.
[29:34.060 --> 29:49.020]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:49.020 --> 29:55.060]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[29:59.700 --> 30:03.500]  Even fragrances can signal some 4000 separate ingredients.

[30:04.500 --> 30:05.500]  Hi, folks.

[33:53.980 --> 34:19.100]  Oh, that's poetry, isn't it, Nod?
[34:19.100 --> 34:49.060]  Okay, let's get back into Internet 2, how they're going to shut down the Internet
[34:49.060 --> 34:50.060]  2.
[34:50.060 --> 34:53.780]  See, it's just like a domesticate hog.
[34:53.780 --> 34:58.380]  You've got wild hogs on your property and they're very destructive, I mean, a group
[34:58.380 --> 35:03.320]  of 10, 15 hogs, sometimes they're in bands of 30, 40, 50, the biggest I've seen is about
[35:03.320 --> 35:04.320]  50.
[35:04.320 --> 35:10.260]  They'll come in an entire corn field, an entire field of soybeans, it can be anything.
[35:10.260 --> 35:16.180]  They will just destroy it, they just turn the ground over like tractors.
[35:16.180 --> 35:24.820]  Many, even domesticated pigs in a few generations grow long hair, big tusk, they go wild.
[35:24.820 --> 35:28.140]  And you've got to trap them or they'll destroy your property.
[35:28.140 --> 35:33.980]  And they've just type in Texas infestation wild hogs, I mean, they're destroying everything.
[35:33.980 --> 35:37.540]  There's coyotes running wild everywhere, there was one by our house the other day, freaking
[35:37.540 --> 35:39.820]  the neighbors out, they think it's like a wolf that's going to eat them, it's pretty
[35:39.820 --> 35:40.820]  funny.
[35:40.820 --> 35:44.580]  They will eat your house dogs and cats though, they'll even attack big dogs, group of coyotes
[35:44.580 --> 35:48.620]  will and they'll eat it, but not usually people, wolves do attack people though.
[35:48.620 --> 35:53.540]  But I'm already digressing here.
[35:53.540 --> 36:05.620]  How did I start talking about internet too and get off into invasive species?
[36:05.620 --> 36:11.460]  You see, I start talking about the internet and how they're going to take it over and
[36:11.460 --> 36:14.820]  then I start talking about toll roads, how they put tolls on existing roads because it's
[36:14.820 --> 36:16.740]  a parallel, it's the same system.
[36:16.740 --> 36:25.780]  Oh yeah, I got off into invasive species because they treat us like wild hogs or how
[36:25.780 --> 36:27.740]  any animal was domesticated.
[36:27.740 --> 36:36.300]  How do you think our ancestors 6,000, 7,000 years ago began domesticating horses?
[36:36.300 --> 36:45.060]  Well they started feeding them, they started getting them up near their camp, they started
[36:45.060 --> 36:51.420]  building little corrals and then putting food out each day till the horses came in and felt
[36:51.420 --> 36:58.540]  safe there and then they would close the door and then they would over the next month or
[36:58.540 --> 37:05.500]  so give the horse more food, take care of it, basically train it to the point of where
[37:05.500 --> 37:10.780]  man finally got on the back of the horse.
[37:10.780 --> 37:17.220]  Now some anthropologists and the behaviors that study human interactivity with domesticated
[37:17.220 --> 37:26.860]  animals will say that more likely a big cat or something would kill a mother horse and
[37:26.860 --> 37:35.020]  that then humans would capture and domesticate a baby colt and then take care of it and raise
[37:35.020 --> 37:39.420]  it and that's certainly how dogs, that's certainly how we brought wolves in.
[37:39.420 --> 37:44.820]  A puppy's cute, even a wolf puppy is very cute and so we know that's how that happened
[37:44.820 --> 37:49.380]  but this is the opposite domestication, this is the elite because humans are predators
[37:49.380 --> 37:55.460]  and this is an elite that operate as predators and they're using us, the sub-oids, to use
[37:55.460 --> 38:01.260]  a Frank Herbert term, he also coined prison planet ladies and gentlemen, that's where
[38:01.260 --> 38:08.420]  I got the term, not from the ridiculous Scientologist as some say, I got it from Frank Herbert
[38:08.420 --> 38:19.140]  and his prison planet, the prison planet where people were sent by the Patashire Emperor,
[38:19.140 --> 38:24.620]  I'm already digressing.
[38:24.620 --> 38:31.900]  So the way you domesticate, well you're not wanting to domesticate the wild hogs, you
[38:31.900 --> 38:36.620]  want to get them into the pen to kill them, but it's the same thing for domestication
[38:36.620 --> 38:44.060]  of goats, sheep, chickens, bovine, that's how they got the water buffalo and others which
[38:44.060 --> 38:51.580]  is the same thing as a cow, just wild, hadn't been bred yet, hadn't been genetically selected
[38:51.580 --> 38:54.820]  for being docile, having a lot of meat on its bones.
[38:54.820 --> 39:04.100]  You trick the hogs to come in to the fenced area and you got a timer on the fence and
[39:04.100 --> 39:10.180]  so you've got a grain dispenser or if you want to lure them in, maybe some of the dispenses
[39:10.180 --> 39:17.260]  sugar cubes, type of range cube with molasses and the gates open and for a month it spews
[39:17.260 --> 39:24.580]  out some sugar cubes when the gate doesn't close because at first little stupid piglets
[39:24.580 --> 39:29.060]  are going to run in there and sows are going to run in there and the big boar who normally
[39:29.060 --> 39:33.380]  runs things, the biggest, fattest, meanest one, he'll even nuzzle them and gripe at them
[39:33.380 --> 39:36.860]  and squeal at them and tell them not to go in but they'll finally go in and eat and he'll
[39:36.860 --> 39:41.060]  see that they're eating and see that it's safe and he'll finally go in after a few weeks
[39:41.060 --> 39:48.500]  then the timer goes off and the gate shuts. Now you've got to for a couple weeks though
[39:48.500 --> 39:50.860]  not knowing they're finally going to take the bait, you've got to be waiting in a pickup
[39:50.860 --> 39:54.780]  truck down the road and show up five minutes after the timer goes off because the pigs
[39:54.780 --> 39:58.900]  will go crazy and start ramming it, they'll dig under it and they'll get out and you've
[39:58.900 --> 40:07.060]  got to jump out with your semi-automatic rifle and run up and shoot them and by the way for
[40:07.060 --> 40:12.100]  the animal lovers don't be stupid, did you know wild hogs eat baby fawns, they eat baby
[40:12.100 --> 40:16.220]  deer and they also drive the deer out and destroy their habitat, it's an invasive species
[40:16.220 --> 40:22.340]  environmental fools, this is real environmentalism, it's nothing, believe me, it's not fun shooting
[40:22.340 --> 40:27.820]  15 hogs as they squeal with gouts of blood squirting in every direction and then having
[40:27.820 --> 40:34.140]  to load them on the backs of trucks or drag them with tractors in and then give them to
[40:34.140 --> 40:37.980]  the locals who butcher them, the local poor do butcher them and do eat it, well I just
[40:37.980 --> 40:42.100]  ate some a few weeks ago when I was out visiting family, the problem is hogs are so smart that
[40:42.100 --> 40:46.180]  all of them never go into the pen and then once the rest of them have seen that they
[40:46.180 --> 40:51.500]  never go in again, the hogs destroying our property now will not go into pens, will not
[40:51.500 --> 40:58.820]  go into the traps, it's the smartest land animal next to humans in the elephant, poor
[40:58.820 --> 41:03.660]  scenes are smart ladies and gentlemen and I mean they're like twice as smart as a dog,
[41:03.660 --> 41:10.020]  their nose is many times better than a dog's and they're vicious and they're just unstoppable
[41:10.020 --> 41:20.380]  some, but I've already digressed, the point here is that's what's happened with internet,
[41:20.380 --> 41:24.780]  they build the internet, they let you use it, they let you get addicted to it and they,
[41:24.780 --> 41:29.140]  the social planners and I'm not saying their gods are perfect, I think they've miscalculated,
[41:29.140 --> 41:33.340]  wrote 30 years ago, I've just now been discovering this stuff, that they were going to build
[41:33.340 --> 41:37.900]  it, let us have it and then take control of it and use it as World Wide Web was called
[41:37.900 --> 41:47.260]  by the NSA World Wide Wiretap, World Wide Wiretap and the globalists want everything
[41:47.260 --> 41:51.340]  interconnected where no nation can stand against another so there's just this global financial
[41:51.340 --> 41:54.940]  oligarchy above it and they believe the web is going to tie us all together, which it's
[41:54.940 --> 42:01.380]  doing and they predicted there'd be free speech and flash mobs and people waking up
[42:01.380 --> 42:09.180]  though not to this level.
[42:09.180 --> 42:17.300]  So what they're going to do is let the old hubs break down and let there be more and
[42:17.300 --> 42:22.620]  more failure and they've been saying this for at least four years, I've learned about
[42:22.620 --> 42:27.220]  it six years ago, but for four years they've been saying as the connectivity breaks down,
[42:27.220 --> 42:31.180]  even if governments say they've got to have net neutrality because the population forces
[42:31.180 --> 42:36.940]  it, 90 plus percent of people in major polls want net neutrality, even Ron Paul changed
[42:36.940 --> 42:45.340]  his position on that and finally figured out what it meant, they'll say hey we don't have
[42:45.340 --> 42:51.580]  to provide this, we're on this new system and on that new system you will have say University
[42:51.580 --> 43:06.780]  of Texas dot edu slash info wars or slash fox news or slash gov and they will decide
[43:06.780 --> 43:10.900]  if you're allowed to have a website, it'll be like MySpace but more controlling what
[43:10.900 --> 43:16.260]  videos you can post, what bulletins you can send out, everything is moving towards forcing
[43:16.260 --> 43:21.860]  you onto their hubs where it's like dig where they can censor what they want or where you
[43:21.860 --> 43:26.500]  notice my bulletins most of the time, everybody points out and MySpace is admitted in memos
[43:26.500 --> 43:31.380]  they've put out, they've told people yes this is a band, Jones prison planet isn't allowed
[43:31.380 --> 43:41.300]  to be sent out even to members of his MySpace account and universities and Comcast and libraries
[43:41.300 --> 43:49.180]  we're in the software that are sold by companies that block, we're in with terror and porn
[43:49.180 --> 43:57.980]  and hacking and gambling so you already see the model of that but people then figure out
[43:57.980 --> 44:01.660]  that things like dig or MySpace are controlled so they migrate away from them so they have
[44:01.660 --> 44:11.260]  to force you onto that, there's also the taxation, they're going to tax emails, they're going
[44:11.260 --> 44:17.500]  to tax internet connections, also the new web is going to be such high speed that it's
[44:17.500 --> 44:23.180]  going to be expensive, they're talking about $75 to be on internet too a month, that'll
[44:23.180 --> 44:38.220]  cut out a lot of people out of the market, this is the system that they are creating,
[44:38.220 --> 44:42.300]  they're also passing hate speech laws so they can shut people down and kick them off of
[44:42.300 --> 44:49.340]  the web, I mean they're people in Canada and people in Germany, people all over who
[44:49.340 --> 44:59.940]  get criticized because they don't bash Israel, they get arrested if they do, that's the
[44:59.940 --> 45:07.780]  world or if you criticize some group or you say I don't want a million Turks a year coming
[45:07.780 --> 45:18.540]  into Germany or I don't want a million Middle Easterners coming in, you see this is the
[45:18.540 --> 45:22.780]  control grid, they're also attacking free speech and see the government of France is
[45:22.780 --> 45:30.300]  suing Yahoo trying to make them not allow Yahoo to have subwebsites that criticize Israel
[45:30.300 --> 45:34.380]  and so trying to shut people down and then if Yahoo is forced to do that there then they'll
[45:34.380 --> 45:41.660]  be forced to do that here, you see this is all happening so there's a multifaceted multivariate
[45:41.660 --> 45:53.060]  attack going on and you see constant demonization, you see constant attacks using the worst examples
[45:53.060 --> 46:01.980]  of what freedom creates, the scummiest porn, the scummiest violence, the horrible stalking,
[46:01.980 --> 46:06.020]  really bad things that go on on the internet and then every night on the news they say
[46:06.020 --> 46:11.620]  see look at this, look at this, look how horrible it is, a woman being raped and then it's put
[46:11.620 --> 46:22.260]  on YouTube and then oh we've got to all lose our rights now, you see so they're doing a
[46:22.260 --> 46:26.740]  job on us and we're now only a few years away from this, you're already hearing about Comcast
[46:26.740 --> 46:31.420]  and others blocking whole sections of their competitions traffic, you're already seeing
[46:31.420 --> 46:36.700]  web breakdowns, remember what was it two years ago for like a month and a half about a fourth
[46:36.700 --> 46:41.140]  of the website you couldn't get to remember and it was because two companies was at level
[46:41.140 --> 46:49.340]  two and cogent, it's level two or is that company called level three, level three was
[46:49.340 --> 46:53.580]  the company okay level three and cogent and then they were middle tier, they're not even
[46:53.580 --> 47:01.380]  top tier major infrastructure folks and now Cisco is talking about you know kind of melding
[47:01.380 --> 47:08.860]  internet two over internet one so that's what they plan, now if we're able to get the word
[47:08.860 --> 47:15.380]  out about this they're not going to be able to do it and even if I disagree with the Lurikon
[47:15.380 --> 47:21.980]  Kistas which are probably about half or more of the people in Mexico and probably about
[47:21.980 --> 47:27.300]  a third of people in this country who are Hispanic, who believe that this is Mexico,
[47:27.300 --> 47:33.380]  the Southwest that want to kill all whites, even you know I have to defend their free
[47:33.380 --> 47:38.140]  speech to talk like that as long as they don't say put it into action because even though
[47:38.140 --> 47:45.180]  I hate their speech and dislike it, I have to stand by their right or I will lose mine,
[47:45.180 --> 47:48.820]  Khalid Muhammad would say you know kill all the white women because they're the military
[47:48.820 --> 47:56.220]  manufacturing center and you know probably 10, 15% of blacks from the studies I've looked
[47:56.220 --> 48:04.140]  at believe like that, does that mean that we should take their free speech, no and you've
[48:04.140 --> 48:07.940]  got some extreme white supremacists who say you know we need to go ahead and have a race
[48:07.940 --> 48:16.860]  war and start killing people and I totally disagree with that but you need to understand
[48:16.860 --> 48:22.100]  that we can't take their free speech away because most of the time they're feds or they're
[48:22.100 --> 48:28.340]  being handled by feds and don't even know it and if you take their rights away then
[48:28.340 --> 48:34.020]  we, everyone loses their rights so we can all agree with each other that free speech
[48:34.020 --> 48:38.620]  is important unless your mayor caught you I had on a few weeks ago who admitted they
[48:38.620 --> 48:44.980]  banned most free speech in Europe and was saying it was a good thing, claiming the people
[48:44.980 --> 48:55.220]  want that, incidentally that's up on prisonplanet.tv that interview we took every claim he made
[48:55.220 --> 48:59.220]  and where he said we were liars and we put multiple mainstream news articles right over
[48:59.220 --> 49:01.860]  where it's admitted and somebody says what do you mean you use mainstream news I thought
[49:01.860 --> 49:07.900]  they lie, no most of the time they say oh isn't it wonderful there's a government push
[49:07.900 --> 49:12.300]  to make all babies have microchips in their belly buttons but don't worry it will fall
[49:12.300 --> 49:17.820]  off two weeks later or oh isn't it great the face scanning cameras are everywhere tracking
[49:17.820 --> 49:25.860]  you for your safety and I take that and say no it's a bad idea here's one, most of the
[49:25.860 --> 49:31.580]  time they're telling the truth they're just putting a disgusting spin on it, now other
[49:31.580 --> 49:37.940]  times they flat out lie and say Iran is running Al Qaeda they have rocketed the green zone
[49:37.940 --> 49:54.180]  general Petraeus when Iran is Shiite not Wahhabist and I know you know that but finally Oberman
[49:54.180 --> 49:58.020]  finally talked about it a few nights ago we got that coming up after the Ventura Club
[49:58.020 --> 50:08.460]  I'm going to play and so it's finally the public finally oh Iran's at war with Al Qaeda
[50:08.460 --> 50:20.020]  meanwhile Petraeus Bush McCain Lieberman in the past has said they're backing Al Qaeda
[50:20.020 --> 50:25.740]  though now they know the jigs up oh the cattle no now we're lying we better quit saying that
[50:25.740 --> 50:30.900]  it's now backfiring on us now with certain subgroups they still say Iran is Al Qaeda
[50:30.900 --> 50:36.340]  on neocon fake conservative talk radio so there's how they're going after the web and
[50:36.340 --> 50:41.740]  it's up to you to fight it I'm powerless without you and they're not going to just let the
[50:41.740 --> 50:45.980]  show and other shows continue to grow exponentially they're moving against us so even if we disagree
[50:45.980 --> 50:51.140]  with each other on facets of the new world order we need to team up together against
[50:51.140 --> 50:57.220]  the new world order for free speech of the three million plus edible food plants that

[56:31.580 --> 56:36.660]  that may be true but remember the second amendment with the right to bear arms well that's not
[56:36.660 --> 56:41.820]  done for hunting or fishing our forefathers put that right in there so that we have the
[56:41.820 --> 56:48.260]  ability to rise up if our country becomes oppressive I have it but that only applies
[56:48.260 --> 56:51.500]  in the United States and you've already bugged out of the United States and you're living
[56:51.500 --> 56:56.060]  in Mexico Jesse that you've given up on the United States no I've not that's where you
[56:56.060 --> 57:04.540]  go to learn about revolution so that you can bring it back home you know no everyone

[1:01:34.660 --> 1:01:39.900]  too many why what's your problem with the two party system well my problem with the two
[1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:44.500]  party system is that it's not a party with only two you gotta have more than two people
[1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:48.900]  to have a party well i mean the republican party is a big tent wait a lot of people are
[1:01:48.900 --> 1:01:55.140]  in the republican party i mean it's got a very broad base you've got like ron paul who's
[1:01:55.140 --> 1:02:01.380]  the crazy coot candidate and then you've got um dick cheney who is the candidate of of
[1:02:01.380 --> 1:02:06.380]  the mole people totally totally different i have another name for dick cheney he's called
[1:02:06.380 --> 1:02:14.260]  the chicken hawk i think i think that means i think that means he picks up teenage gay
[1:02:14.260 --> 1:02:19.780]  prostitutes no no what it means is when it was his time to go to war during vietnam he
[1:02:19.780 --> 1:02:24.500]  was chicken he had a student deferment sir he had to four of them five actually five
[1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:30.260]  whatever i lost count yeah he had to i mean he went he was well wait a minute though college
[1:02:30.260 --> 1:02:35.020]  post college wait when we go to war shouldn't we have the best and the brightest right back
[1:02:35.020 --> 1:02:38.660]  in washington it's like well the other people where to go why do you get a student deferment
[1:02:38.660 --> 1:02:44.660]  then because so he could be bester and brighter that's why we needed them like george bush
[1:02:44.660 --> 1:02:48.980]  said the only problem with vietnam was we left too soon well why didn't those two come
[1:02:48.980 --> 1:02:55.820]  over and help out now george bush was with the alabama national guard no the texas he
[1:02:55.820 --> 1:03:02.140]  was guarding dalas from the north vietnamese air force but he was sent to alabama and they
[1:03:02.140 --> 1:03:05.700]  couldn't find him there and i think you know what i think he was on missions in vietnam
[1:03:05.700 --> 1:03:11.460]  that whole time no he's too humble to talk about no no no he was enrolling in harvard
[1:03:11.460 --> 1:03:16.300]  business school and he never reported for duty that's called unauthorized absence let
[1:03:16.300 --> 1:03:19.900]  me ask you something if i were going to put together an iraqi task force who should i
[1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:26.540]  have on it you or sergeant slaughter because you both are very strong very strong on defense
[1:03:26.540 --> 1:03:31.860]  well that would depend do you want a real veteran or a fraudulent one i'll i'll i'll
[1:03:31.860 --> 1:03:37.580]  take the one that inspires the crowd the most well he's a crowd pleaser that sergeant slaughter
[1:03:37.580 --> 1:03:43.620]  yeah and i was a villain i was a crowd displeaser so i guess i'd have to go with him no no when

[1:04:21.980 --> 1:04:26.260]  don't even know there's a preamble to it go read it says the same thing the declaration

[1:04:40.940 --> 1:04:44.460]  answer was correct if they're trying to put you in a death camp then you physically fight

[1:07:56.020 --> 1:08:04.780]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex
[1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:15.220]  jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones jesse ventura
[1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:22.180]  was right to say that revolution is brewing in mexico unfortunately it is a leftist revolution
[1:08:22.180 --> 1:08:27.580]  which is part of the same control arm of the international banks they've been proven to
[1:08:27.580 --> 1:08:32.900]  have set it all up and control almost every facet of it there are a few communist revolutions
[1:08:32.900 --> 1:08:43.740]  that they do not control but those are always shut down rather quickly but if you look at
[1:08:43.740 --> 1:08:49.540]  our experience here in this nation for decades the british government was oppressive to its
[1:08:49.540 --> 1:08:56.020]  subjects and had double standards there was more and more liberty being demanded in england
[1:08:56.020 --> 1:09:03.500]  at the very same time there was a great awakening for freedom and so the colonists actually
[1:09:03.500 --> 1:09:09.460]  had almost half of the parliamentary support in fact they had more than that until king
[1:09:09.460 --> 1:09:14.300]  george the third rode down in a parade and spoke to parliament which was unprecedented
[1:09:14.300 --> 1:09:18.660]  and told them they were basically treasonous to the crown if they didn't vote for the war
[1:09:18.660 --> 1:09:22.180]  so that's another reason the british finally lost was because they didn't have support
[1:09:22.180 --> 1:09:31.020]  at home eight nine years into the conflict but it started when the redcoats went into
[1:09:31.020 --> 1:09:36.900]  lexington and concord to confiscate the firearms that's why it's ashenine the control corporate
[1:09:36.900 --> 1:09:41.180]  press claiming that we didn't own guns in the in the colonies and that most people didn't
[1:09:41.180 --> 1:09:47.500]  have guns and they were caught putting out fake textbooks university of chicago did with
[1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:52.660]  with with fake letters and fake church records that no one owned guns you know that two percent
[1:09:52.660 --> 1:09:59.220]  dead turned out it was all fake all lies just totally made up everybody owned guns it was
[1:09:59.220 --> 1:10:09.860]  a frontier nation we just had massive wars with the french wars with the natives and
[1:10:09.860 --> 1:10:18.060]  so that's the reality of how this nation started and i don't want a revolution to start i don't
[1:10:18.060 --> 1:10:22.020]  want a violent revolution to start that is i don't want people to be shooting and killing
[1:10:22.020 --> 1:10:26.140]  each other in the streets and cops to be getting killed and foreign troops be brought in which
[1:10:26.140 --> 1:10:32.180]  they've publicly announced they'll do and have already set up the unbelievable is happening
[1:10:32.180 --> 1:10:37.420]  i don't want that to happen is that they brought german mercenaries in and others during the
[1:10:37.420 --> 1:10:44.700]  war against the crown the crown brought those in against the colonists i don't want that
[1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:49.100]  to happen i mean we really are in dangerous times we're in insane times the establishment
[1:10:49.100 --> 1:10:53.700]  really has built fema camps they really are trying to sell the public on being arrested
[1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:58.500]  and put in camps they're putting up trial balloons announcing it it's now being openly
[1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:09.420]  debated i don't want this to happen i don't want this to develop let's go ahead and play
[1:11:09.420 --> 1:11:13.780]  a little clip of oberman and his countdown show talking about something that we've been
[1:11:13.780 --> 1:11:23.820]  talking about for the last four years the war is now five plus years old but there's
[1:11:23.820 --> 1:11:29.220]  a little bit of spin here will comment on that after the after we play the maximum the
[1:11:29.220 --> 1:11:33.980]  enemy of my enemy is my friend is believed ironically in this context to be an old arabic
[1:11:33.980 --> 1:11:38.020]  proberb our fifth story in a countdown the problem is especially in a world evidently
[1:11:38.020 --> 1:11:42.780]  too complicated for the bush administration sometimes the enemy of your enemy is still
[1:11:42.780 --> 1:11:46.620]  your enemy the same president who famously declared little more than five years ago
[1:11:46.620 --> 1:11:51.100]  that you're either with us or you are against us in the war on terror is now reported to
[1:11:51.100 --> 1:11:55.500]  be secretly funding jihadists linked with al-qaeda in an attempt to stem the growth
[1:11:55.500 --> 1:12:00.220]  of shia influence across the middle east and influence the administration itself magnified
[1:12:00.220 --> 1:12:07.140]  by invading iraq yes al-qaeda as in nine eleven vice president cheney today making a surprise
[1:12:07.140 --> 1:12:11.860]  visit to president mushar of pakistan delivering what officials say was a tough message to
[1:12:11.860 --> 1:12:17.020]  shut down the taliban and al-qaeda in that country or risk using a losing us aid more
[1:12:17.020 --> 1:12:22.300]  specifically the vice president saying that the newly elected democratic congress could
[1:12:22.300 --> 1:12:26.940]  cut the aid unless pakistani forces became far more aggressive one presumes mr. mushar
[1:12:26.940 --> 1:12:31.860]  remembered mr. cheney and mr. bush still believe they have some measure of control over american
[1:12:31.860 --> 1:12:36.420]  foreign policy say about a hundred and fifty percent so i say overman finally covers it
[1:12:36.420 --> 1:12:44.420]  this is from a year ago but it's much worse than that it's the actual number three of
[1:12:44.420 --> 1:12:49.260]  al-qaeda that has been commanding the forces for more than four years i keep saying four
[1:12:49.260 --> 1:12:55.420]  years it's we learned about this about eight months into the invasion and takeover when
[1:12:55.420 --> 1:13:10.620]  iraq was firmly in the pause in the grasp of the neocons and so they then kind of spin
[1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:14.300]  it like well they're just working with some people connected to al-qaeda know this is
[1:13:14.300 --> 1:13:22.980]  actual al-qaeda but why didn't overman go further into that why didn't he talk about
[1:13:22.980 --> 1:13:29.460]  how in nineteen seventy nine six months before the russians invaded afghanistan how the cia
[1:13:29.460 --> 1:13:38.100]  gave him hundreds of millions of dollars of funding to actually attack the russians which
[1:13:38.100 --> 1:13:43.540]  precipitated the russians coming in to defend their minions who begged for them to come
[1:13:43.540 --> 1:13:50.820]  in and save them inside afghanistan but the people running the u.s. and i want to say
[1:13:50.820 --> 1:13:57.500]  the u.s. because we're always in the psychology of its us now we're being used here why doesn't
[1:13:57.500 --> 1:14:01.740]  overman want to talk about that i guess he doesn't want to discuss that because it would
[1:14:01.740 --> 1:14:07.980]  talk about about jimmy carter and it's important to keep this in the left right paradigm of
[1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:15.180]  republicans monsters democrats good that's why overman has admitted that he strongly
[1:14:15.180 --> 1:14:21.460]  considering taking a football and baseball announcers job he's been offered a bunch
[1:14:21.460 --> 1:14:27.540]  of them and leaving television news entirely in the past that was his job he called football
[1:14:27.540 --> 1:14:31.740]  and baseball games by the way i'd seen some of the games he called he's excellent back
[1:14:31.740 --> 1:14:39.540]  in the day when i had time to watch those things fifteen years ago but keith oberman
[1:14:39.540 --> 1:14:43.500]  admits that well he won't have anything to do once the democrats are in because i guess
[1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:49.740]  he thinks everything's gonna be fine the military industrial complex is owned by the private
[1:14:49.740 --> 1:14:54.420]  banks that own the defense contractors and own big pharma and they're going to continue
[1:14:54.420 --> 1:14:59.420]  every single agenda under hillary or barack obama if they get into office they will continue
[1:14:59.420 --> 1:15:03.580]  the exact same agenda if john mccain gets in so people are calling me and emailing me
[1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:06.980]  saying alex why aren't you talking about john mccain why aren't you talking about hillary
[1:15:06.980 --> 1:15:13.420]  clinton or barack obama or the dirt in all of their closets what is the point they're
[1:15:13.420 --> 1:15:19.700]  all bad they're all owned by the same people and it's a distraction to even give credence
[1:15:19.700 --> 1:15:26.340]  to it the only candidate that had any difference in the democratic ilk was denise kacenich
[1:15:26.340 --> 1:15:30.660]  and i don't agree with him on gun control a bunch of other issues and the only candidate
[1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:34.580]  that i did agree with on ninety nine percent of the issues and who i respect and like is
[1:15:34.580 --> 1:15:40.140]  ron paul and they cheated him and blocked him and demonized him and he had a shot at
[1:15:40.140 --> 1:15:46.740]  the presidency in a fair system but it's rigged so i don't blame people that want to go take
[1:15:46.740 --> 1:15:52.540]  over the delegates and then vote for ron paul at the convention and put him in as president
[1:15:52.540 --> 1:15:57.180]  it's just politically uh... that'll be political suicide
[1:15:57.180 --> 1:16:00.300]  i'm all for you going in with the delegates and
[1:16:00.300 --> 1:16:03.220]  taking over the party platform at the state and federal level
[1:16:03.220 --> 1:16:07.320]  and for you causing a big stink and bringing up real issues
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:10.420]  at the convention i've said i'm for that
[1:16:10.420 --> 1:16:15.620]  and then some i was in a clip the other night of somebody saying i was against any of it
[1:16:15.620 --> 1:16:21.100]  i love how people that always attack me never attack me on what i really say or do
[1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:24.600]  they always attack me on some straw man
[1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:26.020]  facsimile
[1:16:26.020 --> 1:16:28.660]  of what i say or do
[1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:31.540]  i was thinking about those that criticize me about quote
[1:16:31.540 --> 1:16:33.580]  giving israel a pass
[1:16:33.580 --> 1:16:36.580]  my last two films
[1:16:36.580 --> 1:16:40.060]  terror storm exposes israel for staging the attack on the u.s. liberty
[1:16:40.060 --> 1:16:41.060]  to blame it on
[1:16:41.060 --> 1:16:41.940]  egypt
[1:16:41.940 --> 1:16:44.380]  but because most liberty survivors i've had on
[1:16:44.380 --> 1:16:47.700]  no and the admirals i've had on in the people that are now deceased like i don't
[1:16:47.700 --> 1:16:51.860]  know more those interviews are there believe that lbj new was involved in it
[1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:55.180]  but as a gift israel a pass it shows that our government was involved
[1:16:55.180 --> 1:16:58.540]  showing the collusion
[1:16:58.540 --> 1:17:01.260]  all we do try to report the truth our jobs easy
[1:17:01.260 --> 1:17:04.100]  or than the last one about how israel
[1:17:04.100 --> 1:17:07.560]  though the white-skinned european jews
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:10.420]  target tex maras told me about this about a decade ago it should be some
[1:17:10.420 --> 1:17:11.500]  documents but
[1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:14.340]  i learned about the ringworm children how they radiate a hundred and ten thousand
[1:17:14.340 --> 1:17:15.940]  jewish shifardic children
[1:17:15.940 --> 1:17:18.260]  the brown-skinned children from
[1:17:18.260 --> 1:17:21.400]  north africa and spain and other areas
[1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:24.060]  and and and and i rack when they invited them in they took them and
[1:17:24.060 --> 1:17:25.320]  radiated them and killed
[1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:29.660]  a lot of them in main the rest of
[1:17:29.660 --> 1:17:33.660]  you know i have the a d l attacking me over that stuff
[1:17:33.660 --> 1:17:35.940]  the co-intel pro doesn't care
[1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:39.020]  they have to demonize me they have to
[1:17:39.020 --> 1:17:41.140]  make people think that i am
[1:17:41.140 --> 1:17:42.780]  not exposing things
[1:17:42.780 --> 1:17:47.020]  because this message is so effective in so dynamic and wakes up so many people
[1:17:47.020 --> 1:17:49.620]  that they're scared to death of the show
[1:17:49.620 --> 1:17:52.980]  then there's well-meaning people who buy into the co-intel pro propaganda and i
[1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:56.920]  wish i could reach out to them but it it just you can't really do it
[1:17:56.920 --> 1:17:58.540]  most of them
[1:17:58.540 --> 1:18:04.140]  because because i know a lot of these people mean well and and you just
[1:18:04.140 --> 1:18:07.740]  most of them i've tried to really analyze and it's just they're too far
[1:18:07.740 --> 1:18:09.780]  gone they can't be reached out to
[1:18:09.780 --> 1:18:11.420]  they can't see the big picture
[1:18:11.420 --> 1:18:13.180]  they can't read
[1:18:13.180 --> 1:18:16.980]  labor zionist documents where they help put hitler in power and then
[1:18:16.980 --> 1:18:20.940]  uh... told uh... you made a deal hitler not to let jews leave it anywhere but
[1:18:20.940 --> 1:18:21.780]  israel
[1:18:21.780 --> 1:18:25.980]  and then made jewish families pay million dollar ransoms at the time
[1:18:25.980 --> 1:18:26.900]  on average
[1:18:26.900 --> 1:18:30.100]  to get their families out very sick
[1:18:30.100 --> 1:18:34.160]  you see i'm against hitler and i'm against the zionist
[1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:37.820]  and i talk about that
[1:18:37.820 --> 1:18:40.780]  but then i understand most people who think that they're a zionist
[1:18:40.780 --> 1:18:43.900]  there's really three different camps and and and they don't understand what
[1:18:43.900 --> 1:18:45.020]  they're part of just like
[1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:47.740]  i don't like having to come up here and talk about how
[1:18:47.740 --> 1:18:51.140]  probably more than half the mexicans in mexico want larika on quista and the
[1:18:51.140 --> 1:18:53.300]  plan of san diego to kill all whites
[1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:55.260]  sixteen and older
[1:18:55.260 --> 1:18:59.500]  and i know that even talking about it probably compacts them more into their
[1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:03.420]  tribal society we're all in tribal societies just like when i bash cops out
[1:19:03.420 --> 1:19:07.060]  of primitiveness myself it probably helps the new world order because that
[1:19:07.060 --> 1:19:11.700]  compacts the cops more into their thin blue lines culture instead of reaching
[1:19:11.700 --> 1:19:15.780]  out to them explaining how they've been used
[1:19:15.780 --> 1:19:19.040]  you know i've begged the people that are always attacking israel
[1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:23.460]  today why don't you hit on how the uh... the the the the the uh...
[1:19:23.460 --> 1:19:26.420]  zionist work with hitler now well now i
[1:19:26.420 --> 1:19:30.340]  i'm not going to get into that uh... hitler wasn't too bad
[1:19:30.340 --> 1:19:32.140]  no hitler was bad
[1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:34.580]  so see this is more sophisticated
[1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:38.020]  the stuff is very sophisticated
[1:19:38.020 --> 1:19:40.980]  it's like we expose the fact that the pope calls for a new world order
[1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:43.860]  and that's working for the new order it isn't enough for the catholics do it all
[1:19:43.860 --> 1:19:44.460]  people
[1:19:44.460 --> 1:19:47.380]  they've gotta make it about their weird little niche
[1:19:47.380 --> 1:19:50.780]  and that's what holds them back from really reaching out with a lot of people
[1:19:50.780 --> 1:19:51.700]  up
[1:19:51.700 --> 1:19:54.140]  it is a big idea
[1:19:54.140 --> 1:19:55.940]  a new world order
[1:19:55.940 --> 1:19:57.740]  in the near future
[1:19:57.740 --> 1:20:09.580]  for thousands of years their dark order group
[1:20:09.580 --> 1:20:13.940]  now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of
[1:20:13.940 --> 1:20:20.060]  exterminating eighty percent of humanity is at hand

[1:25:11.620 --> 1:25:17.540]  get into some other news now secret plans for us troops to stay in Iraq
[1:25:17.540 --> 1:25:23.300]  that's a lot of telegraph today now again remember that before the war a year
[1:25:23.300 --> 1:25:29.780]  before the war I went on air and we read at the
[1:25:29.780 --> 1:25:41.620]  nineteen eighty said that they would use in lobby the u.s. to invade Iraq and
[1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:46.020]  this is when the u.s. was running Iraq basically and big buddies with Saddam and
[1:25:46.020 --> 1:25:50.300]  funding him to attack Iran and giving him even the nerve gas and the CIA
[1:25:50.300 --> 1:25:54.140]  advisors and the weather reports of where to spray it how to spray it how to use
[1:25:54.140 --> 1:26:05.380]  it because Saddam was starting to lose and Iranians were using primitive
[1:26:06.380 --> 1:26:12.700]  cyanide gas in rocket attacks and mortar attacks artillery attacks to be
[1:26:12.700 --> 1:26:20.540]  precise against the more heavily armed but outnumbered Iraqis this is all
[1:26:20.540 --> 1:26:25.060]  mainstream history and go look it up yourself so while they were busy they
[1:26:25.060 --> 1:26:30.780]  took him when he was 18 in 58 48 excuse me training as a CIA assassin he killed
[1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:35.060]  a bunch of people wounded the president then they told the Bathis in 68 put him
[1:26:35.060 --> 1:26:39.140]  in as they had a security let the u.s. run things put our apparatus in our
[1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:48.020]  apparatus in and we will protect you and then they staged a coup in 79 and
[1:26:48.020 --> 1:26:53.620]  fully took over and so basically the u.s. and Israel were running with the
[1:26:53.620 --> 1:26:57.460]  British advising they had drawn the maps they were the real king makers they'd
[1:26:57.460 --> 1:27:01.900]  set up Israel as the set piece through the Rothschilds and others but using
[1:27:01.900 --> 1:27:06.220]  British power right at the end of World War one again they create these conflicts
[1:27:06.220 --> 1:27:15.860]  and the whole time while Saddam's our boy they are plotting how in the next
[1:27:15.860 --> 1:27:20.820]  decade they want to create an excuse to attack Iraq go in and kill Saddam break
[1:27:20.820 --> 1:27:25.860]  the country in three to four parts and then it said that u.s. troops would be
[1:27:25.860 --> 1:27:31.060]  there for the next century and that in the decades afterward they would project
[1:27:31.060 --> 1:27:37.540]  power into Syria Iran link up with Afghanistan and there you have the
[1:27:37.540 --> 1:27:42.620]  project for the American century republished in 1997 they wrote about
[1:27:42.620 --> 1:27:47.780]  the 62 revolutions and how they first wanted to go into Iraq so and then they
[1:27:47.780 --> 1:27:50.620]  wrote a letter to Bill Clinton saying do this and he went ahead and bombed them
[1:27:50.620 --> 1:27:58.140]  you know followed orders but then they get on television they lie to the public
[1:27:58.140 --> 1:28:01.900]  and say the troops will be back by Christmas they'll be back in just seven
[1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:06.100]  eight months guaranteed everything's going to be wonderful and the first thing
[1:28:06.100 --> 1:28:09.620]  they do is disband the military disband the Republican Guard disband the
[1:28:09.620 --> 1:28:15.260]  government knowing everything would disintegrate then they started funding
[1:28:15.260 --> 1:28:18.220]  the different rival factions to kill each other and we told you that four
[1:28:18.220 --> 1:28:23.860]  years ago and now it's come out in the news to keep the conflict going then I
[1:28:23.860 --> 1:28:27.140]  predicted even before the war started they would have it go three four years
[1:28:27.140 --> 1:28:31.380]  then stop funding the conflict for a while to make it about first it's oh we
[1:28:31.380 --> 1:28:34.700]  can't leave the conflicts too bad and oh look now we can't leave we fixed almost
[1:28:34.700 --> 1:28:38.620]  all the conflict and then when you gripe they they turn the conflict back on by
[1:28:38.620 --> 1:28:45.580]  attacking al-sader two weeks ago and then claim Iran is it is is al-Qaeda and
[1:28:45.580 --> 1:28:53.140]  is attacking I mean it's amazing how they do it's ordered out of chaos secret

[1:36:54.660 --> 1:36:59.980]  that in a minute but first let me cover this secret plans for us troops to stay
[1:36:59.980 --> 1:37:04.580]  in Iraq a secret draft agreement is being drawn up to allow United States
[1:37:04.580 --> 1:37:10.340]  forces to remain in Iraq indefinitely it has been reported what a joke as if the
[1:37:10.340 --> 1:37:14.580]  puppet president of Iraq runs even the green zone which they're evacuating from
[1:37:14.580 --> 1:37:20.580]  as if he isn't a complete and total puppet the document which was written a
[1:37:20.580 --> 1:37:25.100]  month ago and is marked secret and sensitive is intended to replace the
[1:37:25.100 --> 1:37:29.780]  United Nations mandate for coalition troops including British forces to
[1:37:29.780 --> 1:37:35.220]  remain in Iraq which expires at the end of the year see you in operation they're
[1:37:35.220 --> 1:37:38.460]  the boss the draft authorization would allow for the US to conduct military
[1:37:38.460 --> 1:37:42.900]  operations in Iraq and to detain individuals when necessary for
[1:37:42.900 --> 1:37:48.500]  imperative reasons of security it does not set a time limit but describes the
[1:37:48.500 --> 1:37:52.940]  arrangement as temporary and points out that US forces does not want permanent
[1:37:52.940 --> 1:37:56.300]  bases that's why they're building them everywhere or a permanent military
[1:37:56.300 --> 1:37:59.140]  presence in the country they're just official documents say a hundred years
[1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:03.860]  it also states the US does not seek to use Iraq as a base to launch operations
[1:38:03.860 --> 1:38:08.620]  against other states the draft agreement is unlikely to emerge unscathed from
[1:38:08.620 --> 1:38:11.820]  political scrutiny in Baghdad or Washington there appears a little
[1:38:11.820 --> 1:38:16.940]  appetite in the US for a drawn-out occupation of Iraq in Baghdad both she
[1:38:16.940 --> 1:38:20.540]  and Sunni political groups opposed the American presidents are likely to oppose
[1:38:20.540 --> 1:38:27.980]  the agreement if it is in its draft form well Kata al-Sardar the vocal critic of
[1:38:27.980 --> 1:38:31.780]  the occupation said yesterday that he would consider disbanding his powerful
[1:38:31.780 --> 1:38:37.860]  Mahdi army but only after consulting the Ayatollahs or religious leaders Iraq's
[1:38:37.860 --> 1:38:43.020]  prime minister Maliki said that if a militia which has battled American and
[1:38:43.020 --> 1:38:45.900]  government forces in Bosnia and Baghdad for the past few weeks was not
[1:38:45.900 --> 1:38:50.700]  disbanded its political wing could be barred from provincial elections they
[1:38:50.700 --> 1:38:54.060]  no longer have a right to participate in the political process or to take part in
[1:38:54.060 --> 1:39:00.460]  the upcoming elections until they end the Mahdi army said Maliki now let's stop
[1:39:00.460 --> 1:39:05.380]  and talk about the facts a year and a half ago they make a truce with the
[1:39:05.380 --> 1:39:15.620]  Mahdi then the Iraqi government US controlled slash Israel controlled forces
[1:39:15.620 --> 1:39:21.220]  slash British controlled forces attack them they have a big ball up again then
[1:39:21.220 --> 1:39:26.860]  they're about to have elections and two weeks ago the elections are coming up
[1:39:26.860 --> 1:39:31.860]  two weeks ago all over the country in the south and up to Baghdad there are
[1:39:31.860 --> 1:39:36.900]  midnight arrests people getting drug out of their homes assassinations attacks on
[1:39:36.900 --> 1:39:46.460]  Shiite leaders leaders of the Mahdi army so and then they go after al-Sardar and
[1:39:46.460 --> 1:39:50.580]  try to hit his house and some other things okay so the ceasefire breaks down
[1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:56.020]  they go into Basra all this happens and we said they want this is because the
[1:39:56.020 --> 1:39:59.380]  elections are coming up you watch they're gonna claim and tell everybody in the
[1:39:59.380 --> 1:40:04.340]  news that al-Sardar caused this they're gonna say he's al-Qaeda and in league
[1:40:04.340 --> 1:40:11.340]  with the Easter Bunny and Mr. Ed the horse it doesn't matter what they tell
[1:40:11.340 --> 1:40:16.500]  the public here they'll believe it or some of them will at least and they're
[1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:20.220]  gonna either cancel or suspend the elections or not let the Shiites vote
[1:40:20.220 --> 1:40:27.380]  or not let Shiite candidates be there and of course they have to the country is
[1:40:27.380 --> 1:40:35.420]  majority Shiite so they don't want Shiites running the nation now let's be
[1:40:35.420 --> 1:40:41.100]  clear there's a secular government the US puts in with Saddam then the Israeli
[1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:45.140]  plan comes into fruition to take him out you'll set him up get him to start a
[1:40:45.140 --> 1:40:49.060]  war tell him go ahead and invade Kuwait April Gillespie said go ahead and do it
[1:40:49.060 --> 1:40:52.980]  the US ambassador where your buddy he said okay goes in they set him up they
[1:40:52.980 --> 1:41:00.900]  bomb him they bomb the place for 13 years now they've had five more years of
[1:41:00.900 --> 1:41:05.300]  extermination there's three million dead Iraqis in the total occupation that's
[1:41:05.300 --> 1:41:08.700]  an admitted number we can debate whether it's five hundred thousand or a
[1:41:08.700 --> 1:41:12.740]  million and a half dead since the in the last five years but we know it was two
[1:41:12.740 --> 1:41:18.180]  plus million gone up until the latest wave of having their power plants and
[1:41:18.180 --> 1:41:22.860]  water treatment plants bombed and having their bridges blown out because that
[1:41:22.860 --> 1:41:25.940]  could be used militarily and their airports bombed and their factories
[1:41:25.940 --> 1:41:33.100]  bombed their chemical plants bombed first world nation reduced to cholera and
[1:41:33.100 --> 1:41:41.500]  dysentery and having one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world in
[1:41:41.500 --> 1:41:45.980]  deceptive 60 minutes pieces showing whole warehouses filled with dental office
[1:41:45.980 --> 1:41:49.300]  chairs that were bought by Saddam but look he just hoards them and says he's
[1:41:49.300 --> 1:41:53.420]  not giving a he's not allowed any of the cabling or air pumps that go with it to
[1:41:53.420 --> 1:41:58.340]  run the dental chairs they're waiting for those see that's the top of stuff the
[1:41:58.340 --> 1:42:01.340]  media does look at him they've got warehouses full all this stuff he just
[1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:07.500]  he's greedy they were waiting trying to get the other parts through smuggled in
[1:42:07.500 --> 1:42:20.940]  through Georgia you know through Europe into Jordan out of Iran out of Turkey
[1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:31.580]  through Kurdistan all of this is going on and they go in there the US tells the
[1:42:31.580 --> 1:42:35.220]  Shiites to rise up against Saddam the truth is they wanted to weaken the Shiites
[1:42:35.220 --> 1:42:39.180]  because they had this whole plan set up that's not come out meanwhile somehow
[1:42:39.180 --> 1:42:42.540]  Saddam was given through all these generals that were trained in the US that
[1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:48.660]  were still in place with him where all the Shiites were that was and then the
[1:42:48.660 --> 1:42:54.340]  US didn't give the Shiites air cover to kill them the Shiites now of course know
[1:42:54.340 --> 1:43:00.100]  that now the Shiites are there and they're watching Wahhabi as Sunnis being
[1:43:00.100 --> 1:43:07.100]  put in and with the US backing with many cases matching funds out of Saudi
[1:43:07.100 --> 1:43:13.540]  Arabia Saudi Arabia is the British darling Saudi Arabia was set up by the
[1:43:13.540 --> 1:43:18.780]  British Saudi Arabia matched the money to set up al Qaeda to attack the Russians
[1:43:18.780 --> 1:43:26.860]  to precipitate the war you know I saw Willie Nelson being attacked on a news
[1:43:26.860 --> 1:43:31.060]  article saying Willie Nelson's delusional I just saw this the other night
[1:43:31.060 --> 1:43:35.220]  I had as an article I missed from this interview he believes there were 15
[1:43:35.220 --> 1:43:41.140]  hijackers there were 19 God look how dummy is that dope smoker another
[1:43:41.140 --> 1:43:46.420]  straw man Willie was talking about how 15 of the 19 were from Saudi Arabia he
[1:43:46.420 --> 1:43:51.620]  said why we attack Iraq 15 of them came from Saudi Arabia and it was clear what
[1:43:51.620 --> 1:43:57.300]  he said but the spin doctors spin that just like he said nothing hit building
[1:43:57.300 --> 1:44:01.700]  seven and they took his quotes out of conduction said look at the nut he
[1:44:01.700 --> 1:44:11.660]  doesn't think a plane hit the towers one and two see that's the constant
[1:44:11.660 --> 1:44:17.100]  deception that these dishonest people used to attack us you know if I'm gonna
[1:44:17.100 --> 1:44:21.980]  attack somebody I'll talk them on what they've actually done because I have
[1:44:21.980 --> 1:44:25.460]  respect for myself I have respect for myself intellectually that I'm trying
[1:44:25.460 --> 1:44:28.460]  to be a good person I'm trying to really find out the truth and really bring it
[1:44:28.460 --> 1:44:38.780]  to you that's why it's intellectually bankrupt to say I don't expose that the
[1:44:38.780 --> 1:44:42.180]  Vatican's part of the New World Order when the Pope's openly calling for a one
[1:44:42.180 --> 1:44:45.500]  rule government the last two popes and involved in it I just point out that so
[1:44:45.500 --> 1:44:48.940]  we're Protestant groups and people don't like that they want to make it all
[1:44:48.940 --> 1:44:54.780]  about one group is the devil but see by doing that you miss the big picture of
[1:44:54.780 --> 1:44:58.860]  how evil can manifest in any group or any organization how we need to fight the
[1:44:58.860 --> 1:45:03.140]  policies of the New World Order that's what I tell the Lordy con quiches out of
[1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:06.700]  Mexico okay you want to bring it take down the US you want to take over you
[1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:10.620]  really only had the country for 20 years you couldn't hold it if it belongs
[1:45:10.620 --> 1:45:15.860]  to anybody it's the Native Americans and not the you know Mexicans from Mexico
[1:45:15.860 --> 1:45:20.940]  and by the way the New World Order who's very bad who's poisoning you with
[1:45:20.940 --> 1:45:25.140]  eugenics and doing all this therefore you taking over so right there you're in
[1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:30.740]  the wrong and they'll go oh wow I see what you're saying we got a la reconquista
[1:45:30.740 --> 1:45:34.660]  in endgame in the extras in battle for the Republic that short film you know we
[1:45:34.660 --> 1:45:40.420]  got him going wow that makes sense I mean it's the same thing I find that
[1:45:40.420 --> 1:45:44.980]  IBM and the gates and all these big rich people that the highest levels give
[1:45:44.980 --> 1:45:48.900]  money to eugenics and the Rothschilds give money to eugenics and are all into
[1:45:48.900 --> 1:45:52.660]  it and I find out that they really did fund Hitler and I go well wait a minute
[1:45:52.660 --> 1:45:56.460]  Hitler is being funded by the big bankers and Lord Milner and the British
[1:45:56.460 --> 1:46:01.260]  aristocracy and the founders of modern Zionism something's going on here this
[1:46:01.260 --> 1:46:06.540]  something's bigger and then I find out that Jews and Nordics and Germans go to
[1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:11.060]  weird satanic rituals together and I bring out news articles and quotes and
[1:46:11.060 --> 1:46:16.020]  documents and I go there's an occultic aspect here this isn't a you know this
[1:46:16.020 --> 1:46:19.420]  is different crime syndicates and different mafias who are racial the
[1:46:19.420 --> 1:46:25.220]  Italian mob the Jewish mob the wasp mob you know other mobs you know there's the
[1:46:25.220 --> 1:46:37.500]  Asian mobs they are running racial mafias you know MS-13 Hispanic mafia
[1:46:37.500 --> 1:46:45.060]  Latin Kings on and on that's how we form into groups but at the top these guys
[1:46:45.060 --> 1:46:49.700]  are into Babylon mystery schools people say that's ridiculous that's just made
[1:46:49.700 --> 1:46:55.060]  up it's not they really are into it the UN biological diversity assessments
[1:46:55.060 --> 1:47:00.020]  really is into the occult Prince Philip really is into the occult Ted Turner
[1:47:00.020 --> 1:47:05.260]  really is into the occult dr. Pionka on his own UT website he says he wants to
[1:47:05.260 --> 1:47:10.260]  kill 90% of us he is dressed up like a druid talking about Lucifer on the UT
[1:47:10.260 --> 1:47:18.260]  website the new Israeli parliament supreme court is a giant pyramid all
[1:47:18.260 --> 1:47:24.220]  seeing I I mean it's the same group and so I all I'm saying is is that they're
[1:47:24.220 --> 1:47:32.100]  running it all folks and it's Catholics it's Jews it's Protestants it's it's it's
[1:47:32.100 --> 1:47:38.100]  Muslims are involved in this whole Masonic orders are Muslim their symbols
[1:47:38.100 --> 1:47:43.020]  are Islamic the nice Templars had deals with them and I get Muslims sending me
[1:47:43.020 --> 1:47:46.100]  threatening emails saying that's not true how dare you say that well your own
[1:47:46.100 --> 1:47:51.380]  Koreans as you can't have idols I mean what are these things on top your
[1:47:51.380 --> 1:47:55.380]  minarets you know what are these symbols what are these things you're
[1:47:55.380 --> 1:48:05.580]  wearing I mean I mean this stuff is is is all over the place and they love it
[1:48:05.580 --> 1:48:10.580]  when we fight with each other over black white Hispanic white Catholic
[1:48:10.580 --> 1:48:15.100]  Protestant all of this my point is if you really want to beat them you've got
[1:48:15.100 --> 1:48:25.020]  to really realize the top group and who runs it all the larger picture and see
[1:48:25.020 --> 1:48:31.380]  how they play these double and triple games I mean here they are attacking
[1:48:31.380 --> 1:48:33.980]  the Shiites that do want to be peaceful and aren't trying to take the country
[1:48:33.980 --> 1:48:40.700]  over who've abided by the ceasefire and then saying oh because you fought back
[1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:43.100]  we're not going to let you be part of the election now because we're a
[1:48:43.100 --> 1:48:51.180]  democracy and people are going to elect you and then this insult to the
[1:48:51.180 --> 1:48:57.300]  American people of oh well the Iraqi government wants us to stay the State
[1:48:57.300 --> 1:49:00.500]  Department and others in the Iraqi government have evacuated the green
[1:49:00.500 --> 1:49:06.620]  zone there's still troops in a hospital there but they've evacuated that palace
[1:49:06.620 --> 1:49:12.740]  and moved to another one for four and a half years they've spent what is it up
[1:49:12.740 --> 1:49:15.860]  to ten billion dollars now was supposed to be five billion it's like ten billion
[1:49:15.860 --> 1:49:21.180]  now trying to build a five thousand person quote US Embassy that's an
[1:49:21.180 --> 1:49:28.740]  extermination tower it's a it's a it's a genocide control arm citadel and they
[1:49:28.740 --> 1:49:34.980]  can't even hold it because the wimps inside the technocrats inside are so
[1:49:34.980 --> 1:49:40.380]  cowardly they can't even handle once a week a few mortar shooting over and once
[1:49:40.380 --> 1:49:46.220]  a week with 40,000 people in the green zone total a couple people dying a week
[1:49:46.220 --> 1:49:51.180]  but that same yuppie technocrat will go get on the New York expressway where
[1:49:51.180 --> 1:49:55.060]  there's deaths every day see there the new order doesn't get doesn't have what
[1:49:55.060 --> 1:49:58.820]  it takes ladies and gentlemen they can't even carry out their extermination op
[1:49:58.820 --> 1:50:02.500]  because their own technocrats have their tails between their legs in that green
[1:50:02.500 --> 1:50:06.100]  zone and not to tell you something new order technocrats a hundred years ago
[1:50:06.100 --> 1:50:12.140]  would have been on the front lines people like Churchill out there leading the
[1:50:12.140 --> 1:50:20.740]  black ops in South Africa playing the boars the Dutch off against the English
[1:50:21.700 --> 1:50:29.460]  and the English working with the blacks it's called the great game the British
[1:50:29.460 --> 1:50:39.300]  adopted it from the Romans they learned it from the Caesars and the system is
[1:50:39.300 --> 1:50:46.300]  platonic in nature and if you fully want to understand the mind of the new world
[1:50:46.300 --> 1:50:50.300]  order you must come to grips with that
[1:50:51.060 --> 1:50:55.740]  our beloved republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying
[1:50:55.740 --> 1:51:00.140]  national sovereignty worldwide but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope the
[1:51:00.140 --> 1:51:03.820]  first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up it is essential

[1:54:03.020 --> 1:54:14.060]  something else Linda John disagrees in Ohio so we have to go to him first and
[1:54:14.060 --> 1:54:19.740]  then we'll go to Harry, Jason, Kevin and others I'm gonna take a bunch of calls
[1:54:19.740 --> 1:54:22.980]  now there's a lot of news I haven't even gotten to we're gonna cover it but the
[1:54:22.980 --> 1:54:27.700]  good news is I'm not about to start my third I'm in my final hour we're about
[1:54:27.700 --> 1:54:32.020]  to reach the halfway point of the show because there's a fourth hour now we'll
[1:54:32.020 --> 1:54:36.700]  tell you more about that coming up in the next hour. Let's go ahead now and go
[1:54:36.700 --> 1:54:44.500]  to John in Ohio go ahead John. I've been a supporter of about 60% of what you said
[1:54:44.500 --> 1:54:48.860]  I think you do a magnificent job in analyzing as you did about what's going
[1:54:48.860 --> 1:54:53.700]  on in Iraq the total hypocrisy of the media pretending the United States with
[1:54:53.700 --> 1:54:58.100]  this divided rule funding and arming one side against another is really some
[1:54:58.100 --> 1:55:02.980]  kind of noble angelic referee and is just trying to stay there forever because
[1:55:02.980 --> 1:55:07.820]  of these barbarics uncivilized barbarians that just can't get it together
[1:55:07.820 --> 1:55:13.100]  when they live together married together before we went there but on a larger
[1:55:13.100 --> 1:55:17.900]  scale and I always have a lot of apprehension because I have about 20
[1:55:17.900 --> 1:55:21.420]  things in my cluttered muddled mind that would take two hours and I'll probably
[1:55:21.420 --> 1:55:26.620]  be just a foil that all my ideas will become distorted but I
[1:55:26.620 --> 1:55:32.140]  John I'll give you the time you need the point here is because you call in
[1:55:32.140 --> 1:55:36.900]  you're reasonable when you disagree my pet peeve is someone acting like we
[1:55:36.900 --> 1:55:39.780]  censor and that they're getting through and then reveling and it just makes me
[1:55:39.780 --> 1:55:44.100]  blow up you don't do that you're gonna tell me that the globalists don't
[1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:47.860]  control and manipulate communism it has now been declassified that our government
[1:55:47.860 --> 1:55:53.900]  put Mao Zedong in the power well let me let me point out that I if you know
[1:55:53.900 --> 1:56:01.100]  about Operation Mockingbird you know that the corporate media the
[1:56:01.100 --> 1:56:04.980]  Hydra heads that the thousands of fronts for the CIA and all of its other
[1:56:04.980 --> 1:56:10.900]  alphabet agencies a target and punching bag for the last century has been a
[1:56:10.900 --> 1:56:16.300]  communism anti-communist propaganda no they could they they they created it
[1:56:16.300 --> 1:56:20.660]  to help fund it to create a false bipolar system to set up a police state
[1:56:20.660 --> 1:56:24.100]  here domestically the name of fighting the boogeyman they control well there's
[1:56:24.100 --> 1:56:27.900]  a few details that you overlook the fact that after the boat immediately after
[1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:33.180]  Bolshevik revolution the elite and and 14 capitalist countries sent troops and
[1:56:33.180 --> 1:56:38.660]  divisions to strangle the Bolshevik revolution in its crib as a Churchill
[1:56:38.660 --> 1:56:43.700]  said that they fund financed Hitler based on his anti-sovietism and his
[1:56:43.700 --> 1:56:48.260]  anti-communist no no that's that's true let me stop you but did New York and
[1:56:48.260 --> 1:56:53.900]  London banks send tens of thousands of people from Brooklyn to physically go
[1:56:53.900 --> 1:56:58.180]  help Lenin or are you saying that admitted history isn't true I don't
[1:56:58.180 --> 1:57:02.900]  believe it's true but I do know that it's true for instance even I've never
[1:57:02.900 --> 1:57:08.300]  belonged any organization but I have read various communist literature and
[1:57:08.300 --> 1:57:16.020]  during the 60s and the 70s I read the plp plp.org who were a part of SDS they
[1:57:16.020 --> 1:57:19.940]  were absolute they were communist they were gaining an amazing influence with
[1:57:19.940 --> 1:57:25.980]  an SDS the Bill Ayers and the Bernardine Dorn faction was rabid rabidly
[1:57:25.980 --> 1:57:30.340]  anti-communist most people think they were police Asian provocateurs who
[1:57:30.340 --> 1:57:36.140]  advocated this kind of counterproductive violence that always leads to a crack
[1:57:36.140 --> 1:57:40.180]  down on people they were totally criticized by the plp people as a
[1:57:40.180 --> 1:57:44.580]  communist and they they well there's no doubt that Bill Clinton let the
[1:57:44.580 --> 1:57:48.620]  communist bombers out of jail and that most of them it turned out were feds
[1:57:48.620 --> 1:57:51.420]  before and would never go to jail and they would just bust one of the lower
[1:57:51.420 --> 1:57:54.420]  patsies but the point I'm making is they were not communist they were
[1:57:54.420 --> 1:57:58.620]  anti-communist and and and I was listening to Bob Chapman yesterday on
[1:57:58.620 --> 1:58:02.180]  the power hour and you know he's a conservative and I don't speak for him
[1:58:02.180 --> 1:58:07.060]  but he made the point that this this so-called human rights activity around
[1:58:07.060 --> 1:58:12.420]  Tibet is really heavily involved by the CIA the NED and all of its agencies to
[1:58:12.420 --> 1:58:18.300]  to blackmail the Chinese and to not calling in their chips even and continue
[1:58:18.300 --> 1:58:20.900]  to accept this money money these strategies billions of dollars of
[1:58:20.900 --> 1:58:23.400]  money money from the United States well I mean it's real that they had at a
[1:58:23.400 --> 1:58:27.700]  training camp for the Tibetans back in the 50s but I mean if you're gonna side
[1:58:27.700 --> 1:58:32.380]  with a communist or with the Tibetans that's shameful John

[1:59:58.100 --> 2:00:05.260]  answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[2:00:05.260 --> 2:00:10.860]  live from austin texas Alex Jones
[2:00:14.380 --> 2:00:19.700]  what they do is they get you in a free market slash communist left right
[2:00:19.700 --> 2:00:23.900]  paradigm and then people who are defending the free market say it never
[2:00:23.900 --> 2:00:26.940]  does anything wrong and people defending the communist view say it never does
[2:00:26.940 --> 2:00:30.980]  anything wrong anything that's command and control will immediately be abused
[2:00:30.980 --> 2:00:38.180]  and used by a ruling class and communism has always turned into a bottom up
[2:00:38.180 --> 2:00:43.580]  conduit of the wealth faster than anything else I am for local control I
[2:00:43.580 --> 2:00:48.980]  am even for as the founding fathers pushed you know if people locally want
[2:00:48.980 --> 2:00:51.820]  some governmental system with more control they can have it but at the
[2:00:51.820 --> 2:00:56.540]  national level it's very small very weak and you can have a choice of going to
[2:00:56.540 --> 2:01:00.020]  what state you want or doing what you want different choices in the 13
[2:01:00.020 --> 2:01:11.260]  colonies and then mass and we get into arguments about the Dalai Lama was he
[2:01:11.260 --> 2:01:22.500]  good or bad the point is the communist Chinese admit Mao killed 60 million the
[2:01:22.500 --> 2:01:32.140]  communists Chinese admit that Mao killed 60 million people and so John I mean I
[2:01:32.140 --> 2:01:35.180]  go ahead
[2:01:36.060 --> 2:01:40.860]  well Alex for one thing I'm Alexander Cobra and pointed out that anything that
[2:01:40.860 --> 2:01:45.980]  the present regimes in China or Russia say I have to be taken with less
[2:01:45.980 --> 2:01:49.700]  and a grain of salt they're the mortal enemies of the former regime the CI and
[2:01:49.700 --> 2:01:54.180]  the FBI has been all over those files forging and the rest of it so there's
[2:01:54.180 --> 2:01:57.780]  nothing you can get from the present regime who is the mortal enemy for
[2:01:57.780 --> 2:02:01.620]  instance a Yeltsin bombed his own parliament and killed about 400
[2:02:01.620 --> 2:02:05.660]  remnant communists because they didn't want to give up the social safety net
[2:02:05.660 --> 2:02:10.260]  policies that the new beauties of capital you mean you mean you mean he rolled in
[2:02:10.260 --> 2:02:14.140]  with tanks and rolled in with tanks and artillery and blew the hell out of their
[2:02:14.140 --> 2:02:18.300]  elected parliament be like Bob blowing up the the congress and and everybody
[2:02:18.300 --> 2:02:22.900]  yeah the the communists were really elected they were elected they were
[2:02:22.900 --> 2:02:27.660]  elected every bit as much as Yeltsin was that's true so I'm saying all I'm
[2:02:27.660 --> 2:02:33.020]  saying is they were not elected well Uncle Joe Stalin our good buddy I'm
[2:02:33.020 --> 2:02:38.020]  talking about in the 90s I'm talking about in the 90s when Yeltsin and why
[2:02:38.020 --> 2:02:42.900]  do we have all these Trotskyites who are now the neocons today they're not they
[2:02:42.900 --> 2:02:46.940]  they probably never were even in in their trendy youth I think they were
[2:02:46.940 --> 2:02:51.220]  police agents and spies and no they were they were they were they were thugs who
[2:02:51.220 --> 2:02:55.060]  wanted power and they'll take on a neoconservative guys they'll take on a
[2:02:55.060 --> 2:03:00.180]  commie guys they'll take on anything and certainly the rest of their career was
[2:03:00.180 --> 2:03:04.580]  rabidly the most rabid anti-communist they they they they start there in the
[2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:08.620]  in the Reagan administration they got their their real their real home and
[2:03:08.620 --> 2:03:12.420]  they killed scores of thousands of people in the name of anti-communism
[2:03:12.420 --> 2:03:17.100]  latin and central america the rand contra days and so I'm just saying that
[2:03:17.100 --> 2:03:22.860]  whether the present china a capitalist China I would I would say mostly is
[2:03:22.860 --> 2:03:28.060]  good, bad or indifferent the motive for the project for a new american century is
[2:03:28.060 --> 2:03:32.300]  to cut it is to divide and rule that country as well Russia just as you're
[2:03:32.300 --> 2:03:35.780]  saying in the Middle East their policies are and they will use whether that
[2:03:35.780 --> 2:03:39.220]  government is good better well there's no doubt there's no doubt that they're
[2:03:39.220 --> 2:03:43.860]  using the Tibetans as a set piece against the communist Chinese John I
[2:03:43.860 --> 2:03:47.500]  appreciate your call what you're saying there's true the rest of it is just not
[2:03:47.500 --> 2:03:52.460]  true I just I mean I just you can't admit your whole life what are you probably
[2:03:52.460 --> 2:03:57.220]  65 years old that you've been serving socialism communism bleeding heart you
[2:03:57.220 --> 2:04:02.820]  mean well and you just can't get it you just can't get the fact that McCarthy
[2:04:02.820 --> 2:04:07.380]  was right that McCarthy was being used to destroy liberties and freedoms and
[2:04:07.380 --> 2:04:12.220]  bully Hollywood into supporting right-wing fascism in this country but
[2:04:12.220 --> 2:04:15.340]  as soon as he found out the army and the banks were funding the communists
[2:04:15.340 --> 2:04:20.740]  which is a fact the Rockefellers the Carnegie Endowment all of them factories
[2:04:20.740 --> 2:04:26.580]  over there everything they ran him out on a rail China isn't capitalist it's a
[2:04:26.580 --> 2:04:32.980]  slave grid with a bunch of fat cat commies on top feeding off the slaves
[2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:39.980]  below them their families pass on the power now over there you defeat the
[2:04:39.980 --> 2:04:44.620]  elite by getting rid of the government the elite need the government is a

[2:07:18.460 --> 2:07:22.380]  cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes

[2:08:14.500 --> 2:08:19.740]  you were right i just wanted to plug our april 15th thing well tell folks about it
[2:08:19.740 --> 2:08:25.500]  huh tell folks about it well we're going to have one heck of a rally there it's
[2:08:25.500 --> 2:08:28.740]  not just a ron paul rally it's a rally we're trying to unite all these
[2:08:28.740 --> 2:08:33.220]  different factions together to work together so we'll have one big army to
[2:08:33.220 --> 2:08:37.940]  fight all this corruption which we're not we're taking one step forward and two
[2:08:37.940 --> 2:08:42.900]  back with all these little battles for against the ma u against real i d we
[2:08:42.900 --> 2:08:46.420]  need to all get together and get our shit together listen i appreciate your
[2:08:46.420 --> 2:08:51.460]  call but we really have to try to control our language on the show and i'm
[2:08:51.460 --> 2:08:54.420]  just gonna have to start banning anybody that causes including myself if i do it
[2:08:54.420 --> 2:08:57.780]  again i'll just ban myself how's that sound
[2:08:57.780 --> 2:09:05.060]  um everybody always wants to make one group everybody always wants to only
[2:09:05.060 --> 2:09:13.140]  have one organization i always have said the opposite
[2:09:13.140 --> 2:09:17.140]  we need lots of small and medium and large organizations
[2:09:17.140 --> 2:09:21.700]  tackling different subjects different topics and i was invited to uh your
[2:09:21.700 --> 2:09:24.340]  rally in dc but i want to spend time with my family
[2:09:24.340 --> 2:09:29.300]  and i've put links to it and promoted it uh i know some folks from genesis are
[2:09:29.300 --> 2:09:32.580]  going to it and i wish them well i'm told ron paul's and me speaking there
[2:09:32.580 --> 2:09:35.220]  then there's the big rally coming up later in the summer
[2:09:35.220 --> 2:09:39.620]  that ron paul that says official rally of ron paul's i might go to that
[2:09:39.620 --> 2:09:42.820]  regardless i'm going to be supporting it and promoting it
[2:09:42.820 --> 2:09:47.700]  what happens in these moves to unify
[2:09:47.700 --> 2:09:54.020]  organizations and groups is that what it means if somebody stands up at one of
[2:09:54.020 --> 2:09:58.500]  these events and says you will do what i say or you're not for unity
[2:09:58.500 --> 2:10:01.540]  and then the people that don't want to follow their orders
[2:10:01.540 --> 2:10:08.420]  turn into the bad people
[2:10:08.580 --> 2:10:12.260]  and i've seen so many people arrive on the scene who should and and and and
[2:10:12.260 --> 2:10:14.500]  lend the honeycuts in isolating the granny warriors done a great job but
[2:10:14.500 --> 2:10:18.660]  they've been around for i don't know six seven years i forget doing different
[2:10:18.660 --> 2:10:25.460]  events since i've heard about them and talk to them
[2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:33.300]  and then there's always this call for unity one of the few times we ever had
[2:10:33.300 --> 2:10:36.100]  true unity
[2:10:36.740 --> 2:10:41.220]  was ron paul
[2:10:41.380 --> 2:10:45.860]  and ron paul about two months ago had hit his peak had unbelievable political
[2:10:45.860 --> 2:10:48.180]  capital
[2:10:49.140 --> 2:10:53.060]  and people saw him as the leader and still do to a certain extent and
[2:10:53.060 --> 2:10:57.140]  and and we're ready to be directed and i privately off air and on air
[2:10:57.140 --> 2:11:02.100]  last time he was on with us a month ago said you need to go after the n a u
[2:11:02.100 --> 2:11:05.460]  you need to go after nafta reauthorization you need to go after
[2:11:05.460 --> 2:11:10.020]  socialized health care uh second amendment issues
[2:11:10.020 --> 2:11:14.500]  and put out flyers for folks to download put out a battle plan
[2:11:14.500 --> 2:11:18.580]  because people need goals and we've got some serious fights
[2:11:18.580 --> 2:11:21.860]  uh that are in front of us i said also getting ending the war
[2:11:21.860 --> 2:11:25.540]  and you can galvanize what would be seen as a progressive or liberal arm
[2:11:25.540 --> 2:11:28.660]  against the war bring libertarians into that a pro-gun group for
[2:11:28.660 --> 2:11:31.780]  conservatives and uh you know anti-socialized health care
[2:11:31.780 --> 2:11:37.060]  to educate people and he said yeah we're planning on
[2:11:37.060 --> 2:11:39.780]  doing that we're planning on doing that and i understand it's hard to start new
[2:11:39.780 --> 2:11:42.980]  organizations it's hard to put out battle plans
[2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:47.140]  uh he's still campaigning he's still doing that uh as he says to educate
[2:11:47.140 --> 2:11:50.180]  people in the process and then i saw all the energy
[2:11:50.180 --> 2:11:54.180]  or 90 of it in the movement to getting delegates
[2:11:54.180 --> 2:11:57.460]  and people saying because we're going to make him president we're going to go
[2:11:57.460 --> 2:12:01.060]  vote as delegates and he's going to be the nominee and i said we'll go be
[2:12:01.060 --> 2:12:05.540]  delegates but also
[2:12:06.180 --> 2:12:09.460]  understand that politically if somebody's got 60 delegates
[2:12:09.460 --> 2:12:14.580]  but you go take over a thousand delegates that it'll be political suicide to
[2:12:14.580 --> 2:12:17.300]  come in and say we don't care if you voted for these other candidates
[2:12:17.300 --> 2:12:21.780]  we're now saying it's it's ron paul that just won't happen
[2:12:21.780 --> 2:12:25.380]  and we're gonna see we're gonna see who's right about this
[2:12:25.380 --> 2:12:29.300]  and see the people who are for going in an insurrection and making ron paul the
[2:12:29.300 --> 2:12:34.420]  republican nominee they then won't have a honest debate
[2:12:34.420 --> 2:12:37.460]  about it they will say alex is against us being
[2:12:37.460 --> 2:12:41.540]  delegates alex is against us changing the platform alex is against us
[2:12:41.540 --> 2:12:45.700]  going in and taking over the party no i said do that but that's great but the
[2:12:45.700 --> 2:12:50.580]  problem is let's say you go get a thousand delegates
[2:12:50.580 --> 2:12:53.620]  which nowhere near that's not going to happen but let's just say in a magic
[2:12:53.620 --> 2:12:57.220]  world that happened and they go and they say okay we give
[2:12:57.220 --> 2:13:01.300]  our votes to ron paul ron paul is going to say no
[2:13:01.300 --> 2:13:06.420]  honor the popular vote now he told his office told ten anderson that he said
[2:13:06.420 --> 2:13:10.420]  that in a press release i asked him about it during a break and he says no
[2:13:10.420 --> 2:13:13.060]  people need to support with the delegates you know who they're
[2:13:13.060 --> 2:13:16.580]  you know who that delegates supposedly represents and the people say i want to
[2:13:16.580 --> 2:13:21.940]  hear dr paul say that i want to see it he put it out in the press release
[2:13:21.940 --> 2:13:26.340]  he called uh in fact get ted anderson in here drag him in here
[2:13:26.340 --> 2:13:28.980]  he was one of the head guys in minneapolis saint paul and the ron paul
[2:13:28.980 --> 2:13:31.540]  campaign put up the ron paul air force all of this
[2:13:31.540 --> 2:13:35.060]  and they were instructed by the ron paul campaign to give their delegates to
[2:13:35.060 --> 2:13:38.740]  john mccain will you go get him for me
[2:13:38.740 --> 2:13:42.660]  i know you're paging him but physically go grab him it's okay
[2:13:42.660 --> 2:13:45.700]  and i'm gonna have some guests on about this uh
[2:13:45.700 --> 2:13:48.580]  people who are out there pushing and getting the delegates i've been invited
[2:13:48.580 --> 2:13:52.420]  someone one of them was too busy to come on today maybe i'll get them on the
[2:13:52.420 --> 2:13:56.020]  next few days because they work nights they were just too tired
[2:13:56.020 --> 2:14:01.700]  uh but i mean we'll lay out how this process works and talk about it
[2:14:01.700 --> 2:14:05.780]  but the thing about we all got to get together
[2:14:05.780 --> 2:14:08.820]  you know people doing the n a u and people doing this subject and that
[2:14:08.820 --> 2:14:13.940]  subject well no i mean you we needed ron paul
[2:14:13.940 --> 2:14:16.820]  he still can do it it's not too late though a lot of his energy is dissipating
[2:14:16.820 --> 2:14:20.660]  it's like a bullet you fire into something 90% of the energy is dissipated
[2:14:20.660 --> 2:14:24.820]  some of it may come back kind of like an exploding bullet to the new world orders
[2:14:24.820 --> 2:14:28.580]  torso if he if he activates now even if that bullet slows down they got some
[2:14:28.580 --> 2:14:31.140]  exploding bullets that when they do slow down
[2:14:31.140 --> 2:14:34.420]  and and enter basically finish expanding then they explode so there's an
[2:14:34.420 --> 2:14:38.180]  analogy saying it could come back you know grab victory from the jaws of
[2:14:38.180 --> 2:14:42.100]  defeat but we've already had a victory here
[2:14:42.100 --> 2:14:46.100]  we've already energized woken up tens of million expose the new world order
[2:14:46.100 --> 2:14:50.500]  expose the north american union we need to stop being pessimistic and angry and
[2:14:50.500 --> 2:14:55.460]  expecting everything to be organized the revolution wasn't organized
[2:14:56.660 --> 2:15:01.460]  we need to understand we are ragtag and be positive
[2:15:01.460 --> 2:15:05.220]  and then ron paul needs to put out a treat us of this is the national
[2:15:05.220 --> 2:15:08.580]  coalition this is what we want you to do grassroots with
[2:15:08.580 --> 2:15:12.260]  your own creative ideas defeat socialized health care
[2:15:12.260 --> 2:15:16.420]  in the war force both parties to stop it
[2:15:16.420 --> 2:15:20.100]  a coalition on the economy ron paul he should put out a five page
[2:15:20.100 --> 2:15:23.300]  plan of what he would do to fix the economy i know he's introduced bills to
[2:15:23.300 --> 2:15:27.700]  do it but he needs to state it in like a manifesto ron paul in 20 pages
[2:15:27.700 --> 2:15:31.460]  could lay out four parts five pages of peace
[2:15:31.460 --> 2:15:37.620]  laid out with his ideas about how to tackle each subject
[2:15:37.620 --> 2:15:40.740]  and how to energize and people would form into cadres
[2:15:40.740 --> 2:15:44.420]  and they would and we've got the army of 20 30 million people probably more
[2:15:44.420 --> 2:15:48.020]  who will get involved and do it instead they're feeling pessimistic
[2:15:48.020 --> 2:15:51.540]  and they know it was all for naught or they're drinking kool-aid going he's
[2:15:51.540 --> 2:15:57.940]  going to be president still it's a secret ron paul's for it he's he's gonna
[2:15:57.940 --> 2:16:01.380]  he's gonna secretly we're gonna say he's the nominee and he's gonna
[2:16:01.380 --> 2:16:05.540]  stand up and take it and we're gonna go off the yellow brick road together
[2:16:05.540 --> 2:16:08.580]  off into the sunset
[2:16:10.260 --> 2:16:15.700]  and i mean just because i say what i think i don't sit here like a preacher
[2:16:15.700 --> 2:16:19.220]  and telling you you know everything's gonna be all right just put your money
[2:16:19.220 --> 2:16:23.700]  in the collections play one of these politicians that says
[2:16:23.700 --> 2:16:31.940]  they've got everything nailed down and everything's wonderful
[2:16:31.940 --> 2:16:37.060]  i know how this works when it blows up in their faces
[2:16:37.060 --> 2:16:40.340]  it'll be well it would have worked if people like alex jones would have gotten
[2:16:40.340 --> 2:16:44.420]  behind it i am behind you taking over the
[2:16:44.420 --> 2:16:48.580]  delegates enforcing changes in the platform and taking over the party
[2:16:48.580 --> 2:16:50.580]  system and that's good and that's wonderful
[2:16:50.580 --> 2:16:56.420]  and you're doing it in some areas just don't set expectations
[2:16:56.420 --> 2:17:00.660]  that there is a 99 chance are not going to be
[2:17:00.660 --> 2:17:04.660]  met remember ron paul's letter that first when he put out which they
[2:17:04.660 --> 2:17:07.140]  interpreted saying he was getting out of the campaign
[2:17:07.140 --> 2:17:10.020]  no he just said well it's clear that we're not gonna i'm not going to be the
[2:17:10.020 --> 2:17:13.300]  nominee and we're not going to get the delegates
[2:17:13.300 --> 2:17:16.580]  but i'm going to continue this fight and it now goes into another phase it's
[2:17:16.580 --> 2:17:20.980]  bigger than me the revolution is permanent
[2:17:20.980 --> 2:17:25.300]  to use a trotsky quote and he was laughing about it you know using that
[2:17:25.300 --> 2:17:28.420]  quote our our revolution against them is permanent
[2:17:28.420 --> 2:17:32.660]  it's about you that's why i've always said it's not about alex jones i could
[2:17:32.660 --> 2:17:38.260]  be killed set up framed anytime now i pray that in the case
[2:17:38.260 --> 2:17:43.780]  but you know i'm in the danger zone it isn't about me i don't want it to be
[2:17:43.780 --> 2:17:49.380]  cult of personality or fizzle out or or or be limited i want the victory
[2:17:49.380 --> 2:17:54.420]  and the victory is in you taking on the manifesto of liberty and freedom
[2:17:54.420 --> 2:17:58.900]  understanding it and understanding that the statism and elitism
[2:17:58.900 --> 2:18:03.220]  and corruption and and bullying can take the form
[2:18:03.220 --> 2:18:09.700]  of catholics protestants jews germans communist chinese
[2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:17.540]  venezuelan strongman mexican oligarchs
[2:18:17.540 --> 2:18:21.380]  and good can also take the form and manifestation
[2:18:21.380 --> 2:18:28.580]  of chinese and jews and germans and catholics and protestants
[2:18:28.580 --> 2:18:31.700]  and so we need to understand what are the policies in the new world order
[2:18:31.700 --> 2:18:34.980]  they want to federalize local areas to bring those federal bodies
[2:18:34.980 --> 2:18:38.820]  into larger unions they want to break up the family they want you to go to public
[2:18:38.820 --> 2:18:42.900]  school they want you to take drugs and vaccines we know they poison the water
[2:18:42.900 --> 2:18:46.660]  do they put out a memo telling catholics because it's all catholic run
[2:18:46.660 --> 2:18:52.020]  don't drink the water no they don't if it's all jew run do they put out
[2:18:52.020 --> 2:18:57.140]  memos to jews don't drink the water don't take the vaccines
[2:18:57.140 --> 2:19:03.940]  no they don't it was all uh we think of another one
[2:19:03.940 --> 2:19:09.380]  that's that's the two main groups if it's all alien run you know just it's
[2:19:09.380 --> 2:19:14.260]  it's from the somewhat serious to the absurd
[2:19:14.260 --> 2:19:19.300]  all right i said i'd take calls i am on quite a rant today

[2:25:04.420 --> 2:25:08.740]  um his uh his version of the new world order
[2:25:08.740 --> 2:25:12.820]  just recaps of my my feelings about it uh
[2:25:12.820 --> 2:25:18.180]  um i i've been knowing about him for a long time now and uh
[2:25:18.180 --> 2:25:23.060]  and people in other states need to start picking up a book
[2:25:23.060 --> 2:25:27.060]  uh which what what one i'll read one a year if you're lucky
[2:25:27.060 --> 2:25:30.820]  and uh read about albert pike and albert mackey jd block
[2:25:30.820 --> 2:25:35.540]  uh daniel sickleton all about the new world order which
[2:25:35.540 --> 2:25:42.980]  my my belief is is the masonic uh inspired version of it
[2:25:42.980 --> 2:25:47.380]  and um i've i've had a lot of flak throughout the years and
[2:25:47.380 --> 2:25:51.780]  and uh trying to teach you know to bring it bring it forth
[2:25:51.780 --> 2:25:56.180]  well that's what it is it's a hall of mirrors and it is a mystery religion of
[2:25:56.180 --> 2:25:59.860]  being behind every major group and playing everybody off against each other
[2:25:59.860 --> 2:26:04.340]  and then what they are are scientists who understand how to manipulate the
[2:26:04.340 --> 2:26:09.220]  tribalism of humanity exactly if it's all symbolism you know and uh
[2:26:09.220 --> 2:26:12.980]  yeah they're uh say you know you work your way up to a
[2:26:12.980 --> 2:26:17.380]  seventh degree which is the great knowledge of your who is god you know
[2:26:17.380 --> 2:26:21.700]  and uh if they base themselves over that then it's the secret inside of a secret
[2:26:21.700 --> 2:26:26.820]  inside of a secret in the secret and uh i would like it's like china dolls or
[2:26:26.820 --> 2:26:31.620]  the uh russian dolls yeah exactly and i've been i've been at war with it for
[2:26:31.620 --> 2:26:35.460]  years when i in my younger days back in the in the
[2:26:35.460 --> 2:26:41.460]  seventies uh i i got into it with a uh a shriner and a
[2:26:41.460 --> 2:26:46.020]  uh inspector general which is uh anybody knows that the thirty third
[2:26:46.020 --> 2:26:50.900]  and i i i made toast out of them you know and um
[2:26:50.900 --> 2:26:54.500]  and what the war with an ever since well that's why we have our own symbols of
[2:26:54.500 --> 2:26:58.580]  liberty and freedom and and and and we have to
[2:26:58.580 --> 2:27:02.020]  counter anything that takes liberty anything that takes freedom
[2:27:02.020 --> 2:27:06.420]  anything that oppresses the innocence and then judge a group are they doing bad
[2:27:06.420 --> 2:27:08.820]  and then confront them for the bad they're doing
[2:27:08.820 --> 2:27:12.180]  not for the group they are because if you confront them on their group
[2:27:12.180 --> 2:27:15.380]  then the tribalism kicks in of their minions
[2:27:15.380 --> 2:27:18.500]  all of these groups have predators at the top who
[2:27:18.500 --> 2:27:22.340]  feed on their lowers and they keep the lowers under their control bike
[2:27:22.340 --> 2:27:26.420]  always claiming the outside hates you i protect you
[2:27:26.420 --> 2:27:30.980]  the inner party protects the outer party you okay and and and and and so that's
[2:27:30.980 --> 2:27:33.700]  what orwell talked about and so it's predatory
[2:27:33.700 --> 2:27:38.100]  and so when you go out and say i don't like mexicans and are racist
[2:27:38.100 --> 2:27:41.300]  then it only helps the larica and quisa but when you point out to them
[2:27:41.300 --> 2:27:45.300]  how the big banks are financing the breakdown of the entire americas
[2:27:45.300 --> 2:27:48.020]  and how they're being set up and used they wake up
[2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:52.580]  or when you go to a catholic and say you're not a bad person uh you know
[2:27:52.580 --> 2:27:55.060]  your your your heritage isn't bad it's just
[2:27:55.060 --> 2:27:58.820]  without getting into a debate does the pope call for a one-world government
[2:27:58.820 --> 2:28:02.500]  do they call for a one-world religion is that bad they say yes
[2:28:02.500 --> 2:28:06.420]  okay then you move on okay are the protestant religions
[2:28:06.420 --> 2:28:10.020]  basically part of israel worship now saying israel's god
[2:28:10.020 --> 2:28:14.740]  yes you know is that wrong is that weird is hagi saying jesus wasn't the messiah
[2:28:14.740 --> 2:28:20.020]  is that bad okay boom move on uh then you explain to masons hey i'm not saying
[2:28:20.020 --> 2:28:22.660]  all the masons are bad most of them up until
[2:28:22.660 --> 2:28:25.620]  about 32 degrees don't even really have an inkling their
[2:28:25.620 --> 2:28:29.700]  porch masons or outside masons you go to them and say yeah the founding
[2:28:29.700 --> 2:28:31.620]  fathers were masons yeah they were good guys
[2:28:31.620 --> 2:28:34.820]  and later they found out when they got into higher levels that it had been
[2:28:34.820 --> 2:28:37.620]  they thought had been taken over it really always been that way and they
[2:28:37.620 --> 2:28:39.940]  wrote about it and so you can be like george
[2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:44.260]  washington who woke up and then and then they wake up but if you say you dirty
[2:28:44.260 --> 2:28:48.980]  masons all drink blood uh you know they will say well i don't i'm not into that
[2:28:48.980 --> 2:28:51.940]  so it's not true and then they think you're a liar
[2:28:51.940 --> 2:28:56.740]  that that that that that that fact and then i mean you understand why why i
[2:28:56.740 --> 2:29:00.980]  i i'm so this is so important because this is the only way to attack the new
[2:29:00.980 --> 2:29:04.980]  world order definitely and uh i haven't i've had
[2:29:04.980 --> 2:29:09.860]  many conversations with lower level masons and they have they find it hard
[2:29:09.860 --> 2:29:14.500]  to believe what's going on really and uh
[2:29:14.500 --> 2:29:17.940]  and i'll get my books out from albert pike and all the rest up and i'll do the
[2:29:17.940 --> 2:29:20.020]  quotations tell you what i gotta be fair to other
[2:29:20.020 --> 2:29:22.500]  callers but i'll give you two minutes on the other side
[2:29:22.500 --> 2:29:26.260]  uh harry because i don't want to go to jason and others that have been holding
[2:29:26.260 --> 2:29:31.140]  because i want people to hear this i've had discussions with masons as well
[2:29:31.140 --> 2:29:34.900]  and if you approach it without having a bunch of tribalism involved
[2:29:34.900 --> 2:29:39.060]  and rationally you can wake them up if you don't you're gonna fail
[2:29:39.060 --> 2:29:42.900]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:42.900 --> 2:29:49.540]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:49.540 --> 2:29:53.460]  all right dad let me get this straight i'm so nobody takes place in the future

[2:29:56.820 --> 2:30:01.140]  wait a second i thought star wars took place a long long time ago
[2:30:01.140 --> 2:30:04.420]  all right einstein but it is kind of like star wars anyway
[2:30:04.420 --> 2:30:08.660]  just like star wars there's an evil empire and some people have started an
[2:30:08.660 --> 2:30:11.780]  armed rebellion to fight the evil empire okay

[2:33:20.260 --> 2:33:26.660]  this just in it's gonna be a five hour radio show today i've just decided to
[2:33:26.660 --> 2:33:30.260]  go to two hours extra
[2:33:30.340 --> 2:33:35.300]  now i'm not gonna do that every day you know why i just decided to do it
[2:33:35.300 --> 2:33:40.660]  national british radio is calling me at three ten central about ten minutes
[2:33:40.660 --> 2:33:44.020]  after i'd be off air today we've added the fourth hour
[2:33:44.020 --> 2:33:47.140]  and i'm on uh till right at the end of that hour
[2:33:47.140 --> 2:33:50.180]  so i thought why not just do a simulcast i'm already going to be in here in
[2:33:50.180 --> 2:33:54.580]  studio on the headset and maybe when i do other interviews
[2:33:54.580 --> 2:33:57.860]  now when i'm here at the office and it's on isdn or even phone
[2:33:57.860 --> 2:34:02.740]  maybe i'll patch it in and just randomly pop in with live transmissions
[2:34:02.740 --> 2:34:05.380]  because i'm always doing radio interviews anyways you know when you think my
[2:34:05.380 --> 2:34:10.580]  four hours is over oh no it's just beginning here
[2:34:10.580 --> 2:34:15.860]  uh so when i'm on the radio in south africa or australia
[2:34:15.860 --> 2:34:23.220]  or germany or japan or england or mexico that's the answer we'll start
[2:34:23.220 --> 2:34:26.180]  when we can firing it up so there isn't a whole
[2:34:26.180 --> 2:34:29.540]  another hour coming up by the way i just i took probably what 20 calls in that
[2:34:29.540 --> 2:34:33.700]  hour yesterday i take a lot for some reason i'm in the habit of not
[2:34:33.700 --> 2:34:36.260]  taking calls on this show and then the other one i can just take them one or
[2:34:36.260 --> 2:34:39.620]  maybe it's because they're in my control panel and i see them all
[2:34:39.620 --> 2:34:44.100]  but uh that is coming up and there's video of all this
[2:34:44.100 --> 2:34:47.620]  if you have a prison planet dot tv membership you can see the archives of
[2:34:47.620 --> 2:34:50.740]  these of the fourth hour every day or the fifth hour

[2:38:59.060 --> 2:39:03.140]  i you know these people are in the dark they need to open their eyes and see
[2:39:03.140 --> 2:39:07.300]  what the heck they're belonging to and what what's going on for thousands of
[2:39:07.300 --> 2:39:09.860]  years in the part that they're being played
[2:39:09.860 --> 2:39:13.380]  they're nothing but their puppets and they're being used
[2:39:13.380 --> 2:39:16.820]  and that's i mean that's that's the bottom line and i know i know some
[2:39:16.820 --> 2:39:20.900]  great people belong in the masonic order and i know some that i wouldn't even
[2:39:20.900 --> 2:39:23.460]  i wouldn't give my drop of water if they were drying it
[2:39:23.460 --> 2:39:28.580]  thirst and uh that that's just about it america's gotta wake up
[2:39:28.580 --> 2:39:33.060]  and find out who the heck is running this country and sure the heck isn't us
[2:39:33.060 --> 2:39:36.020]  look let's let's just make it real simple and i appreciate your fine points
[2:39:36.020 --> 2:39:38.740]  harry
[2:39:38.740 --> 2:39:47.060]  it's a gang especially in small towns they give each other business
[2:39:47.060 --> 2:39:50.660]  if one of them gets caught doing something wrong and it's the guy from the
[2:39:50.660 --> 2:39:54.740]  mason hall the cop lets him go when he's totally drunk
[2:39:54.740 --> 2:39:58.980]  but the rest of us they don't and i've told the story of my dad's great uncle
[2:39:58.980 --> 2:40:02.900]  who i got to know but he died when i was five uncle houston
[2:40:02.900 --> 2:40:06.580]  who'd run speakeasies in houston and
[2:40:06.580 --> 2:40:10.260]  run away from home when he was 13 but on a steamship around the world come back
[2:40:10.260 --> 2:40:14.260]  you know as a rough guy run speakeasies all over
[2:40:14.260 --> 2:40:19.780]  houston guys tried to rob him he killed two of them they still had him up on
[2:40:19.780 --> 2:40:24.100]  charges he flashed the mason in distress sign and the old masonic orders would
[2:40:24.100 --> 2:40:27.700]  be that well if they then they were gonna have a masonic
[2:40:27.700 --> 2:40:31.780]  trial and if he really wasn't innocent they would slit his throat
[2:40:31.780 --> 2:40:36.020]  but see that isn't really enforced and the man and the judge let him off just
[2:40:36.020 --> 2:40:38.900]  up everything's dismissed because he flashed the mason in distress you can
[2:40:38.900 --> 2:40:41.860]  get that in a book the problem is you flash that you're not
[2:40:41.860 --> 2:40:45.700]  really a mason they do tend to track you down and kill you
[2:40:45.700 --> 2:40:50.660]  but see the lower masons don't know that it's the higher orders that do that
[2:40:50.660 --> 2:40:54.180]  and it's come out in the bbc london telegraph the scotsman that basically
[2:40:54.180 --> 2:40:57.940]  all i mean 99 percent of the barristers the judges are masons they can do no
[2:40:57.940 --> 2:41:00.260]  wrong
[2:41:00.260 --> 2:41:06.340]  so it's like thousand-year-old crypt or blood gangs you know i'm sure they'll be
[2:41:06.340 --> 2:41:10.340]  in big mansions they didn't fall apart and be having secret handshakes
[2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:14.020]  and that's what skull and bones is there was an anti-masonic party under john
[2:41:14.020 --> 2:41:17.140]  quincy adams they banned it they ran masons out because they've been caught
[2:41:17.140 --> 2:41:22.180]  killing a bunch of people who'd been masons and blown the whistle
[2:41:22.180 --> 2:41:25.460]  they were trying to take the government back over for themselves and they banned
[2:41:25.460 --> 2:41:29.620]  masons and ran them out of the country and then the german and british got real
[2:41:29.620 --> 2:41:32.260]  mad the british gist india company with opium
[2:41:32.260 --> 2:41:35.700]  money this is in the encyclopedia founded with opium money
[2:41:35.700 --> 2:41:38.660]  the skull and bones
[2:41:39.380 --> 2:41:42.500]  in all of that stuff you know they say oh well our first level mock human
[2:41:42.500 --> 2:41:46.420]  sacrifices of higher imabif and we simulate his killing and then his
[2:41:46.420 --> 2:41:50.580]  resurrection and all this stuff but when you get to the higher levels it is
[2:41:50.580 --> 2:41:54.340]  just you know then it's black magic and then above that it's worshiping angels
[2:41:54.340 --> 2:41:58.820]  and you know it's worshiping you know lower level before that it's it's
[2:41:58.820 --> 2:42:03.940]  worshiping goddesses and gods and you know
[2:42:03.940 --> 2:42:07.540]  diana eulogy
[2:42:08.340 --> 2:42:11.300]  and and that's how these occult things work they they they then incorporate
[2:42:11.300 --> 2:42:14.900]  all sorts of other things i mean they'll have
[2:42:16.020 --> 2:42:20.660]  i didn't see it while i was there inside bohemian grove
[2:42:21.060 --> 2:42:25.380]  because it's a 2700 acre redwood grove
[2:42:25.380 --> 2:42:29.540]  and i was in the gorge i probably saw
[2:42:29.540 --> 2:42:33.540]  300 400 acres and that's walking trying not to be talked to
[2:42:33.540 --> 2:42:37.060]  trying to having security asking questions we finally got behind a
[2:42:37.060 --> 2:42:40.820]  it's all on videos in the film we finally kind of got to a deserted camp and
[2:42:40.820 --> 2:42:44.420]  just shat there on a bench behind some bushes till the sun went down we
[2:42:44.420 --> 2:42:46.660]  went and got the ritual on tape and got out of there people say
[2:42:46.660 --> 2:42:52.020]  well in the grove you published on your website a photo of some catholic
[2:42:52.020 --> 2:42:56.980]  uh saint and you didn't talk about that but i learned about it on your website
[2:42:56.980 --> 2:43:00.340]  when you got their annals and put up scanned a bunch of pages in
[2:43:00.340 --> 2:43:03.540]  you're covering it up it's on your website i'm like
[2:43:03.540 --> 2:43:06.580]  and then you're covering it up you have daniel estalan saying the vaticans
[2:43:06.580 --> 2:43:09.860]  involved at the highest levels with the black nobility in the new world order
[2:43:09.860 --> 2:43:14.100]  but it's on your website but you covered it up
[2:43:14.100 --> 2:43:19.540]  you're involved in it i and again it isn't about defending me i don't care
[2:43:19.540 --> 2:43:23.140]  when people attack me it's painful that they mean well
[2:43:23.140 --> 2:43:26.740]  they really believe what they're saying and they really think
[2:43:26.740 --> 2:43:30.180]  they've caught the bad guy
[2:43:30.500 --> 2:43:34.180]  and it never makes any sense i'm gonna talk more about that in the fourth
[2:43:34.180 --> 2:43:36.580]  hour i have no idea what i'll talk about in the
[2:43:36.580 --> 2:43:40.740]  fifth hour today when i'm on national british radio

[2:45:07.620 --> 2:45:13.380]  that is the document of the day oh man uh jason you're just an
[2:45:13.380 --> 2:45:17.220]  unbelievable trooper in arizona you're on the air you get a gold star
[2:45:17.220 --> 2:45:21.060]  thank you very much um i just want to make a comment about barack obama i've
[2:45:21.060 --> 2:45:24.900]  heard you say a couple times in the last uh month or so that uh
[2:45:24.900 --> 2:45:28.740]  you know barack obama is the the best of the worst but um
[2:45:28.740 --> 2:45:32.500]  i'm not voting for him i'm saying he doesn't have a bunch of murders under his
[2:45:32.500 --> 2:45:36.100]  belt he isn't like the clintons i mean i hate the clintons i know they're
[2:45:36.100 --> 2:45:39.220]  wicked that they have become older and eviler
[2:45:39.220 --> 2:45:43.380]  and and and i was saying that i'm not interrupting i'm trying to be clear on
[2:45:43.380 --> 2:45:47.860]  what i'm saying here and when we know that john mccain is totally evil
[2:45:47.860 --> 2:45:51.060]  so i'm saying he's got evil people behind him go ahead
[2:45:51.060 --> 2:45:55.300]  absolutely and i i know you feel that way um i just wanted to make the one
[2:45:55.300 --> 2:45:58.260]  quick correction i've you said a couple times that at least barack obama
[2:45:58.260 --> 2:46:01.780]  voted against the war but i'm actually brought the barack obama didn't get
[2:46:01.780 --> 2:46:05.940]  elected to the senate until 2004 so but he did vote against
[2:46:05.940 --> 2:46:09.300]  funding when all the rest of them did vote for it well he did but that's
[2:46:09.300 --> 2:46:13.380]  sort of a you know a vote of you know of no consequence because he knows it's
[2:46:13.380 --> 2:46:16.980]  going to pass anyway so i think the media has spawned him as the anti-war
[2:46:16.980 --> 2:46:22.740]  candidate and it's interesting that msnbc really seems to be the barack obama
[2:46:22.740 --> 2:46:26.820]  uh station and it's pretty clear that you know that's because they know he's hot
[2:46:26.820 --> 2:46:30.260]  and has a lot of charisma and so they're pushing him
[2:46:30.260 --> 2:46:33.780]  absolutely and i think the other uh element to that is that they're owned
[2:46:33.780 --> 2:46:36.980]  by uh general electric and barack obama
[2:46:36.980 --> 2:46:41.220]  it's the more money from the nuclear industry than any of the other candidates
[2:46:41.220 --> 2:46:44.580]  and i think that's right he's promised to give them uh hundreds of billions at
[2:46:44.580 --> 2:46:48.820]  great points anything else um no i just uh i enjoy your show i'm a first-time
[2:46:48.820 --> 2:46:51.140]  caller and i'll let someone else get on appreciate it all right well you don't
[2:46:51.140 --> 2:46:55.220]  normally have to hold an hour to get on i'm just been out of control today
[2:46:55.220 --> 2:46:58.020]  my pleasure to be on your show and uh it's really a privilege thank well it's
[2:46:58.020 --> 2:47:02.100]  my pleasure to take your call sir uh let's talk to kevin in montana you're
[2:47:02.100 --> 2:47:06.660]  on the air kev hello hello admiral
[2:47:06.660 --> 2:47:12.100]  sir alejandro um my name is kevin i'm calling from minnesota the state of
[2:47:12.100 --> 2:47:15.540]  where jesse ventura okay minnesota i thought i'd montana go ahead
[2:47:15.540 --> 2:47:19.540]  no and uh the reason why i'm calling is that i'm a veteran with the alleged
[2:47:19.540 --> 2:47:24.580]  gulf war illness after learning about the atrocities that they used me as a
[2:47:24.580 --> 2:47:28.500]  guinea pig i started bringing forth and trying to inform the general public
[2:47:28.500 --> 2:47:33.700]  about gulf war illness and at the time jesse ventura was doing a radio station
[2:47:33.700 --> 2:47:36.900]  and this is just before he went into being the uh
[2:47:36.900 --> 2:47:41.380]  mayor of brooklyn park um he made a couple comments about gulf war illness
[2:47:41.380 --> 2:47:44.820]  i used it as an opportunity to get him numerous
[2:47:44.820 --> 2:47:49.460]  numerous amount of information videos pertaining the gulf war illness
[2:47:49.460 --> 2:47:53.540]  he said yeah i was in the the military we had agent orange
[2:47:53.540 --> 2:47:57.940]  he never was a navy seal he trained with the navy seal so that's a false
[2:47:57.940 --> 2:48:01.860]  that's a false statement that he because the neocon website says that
[2:48:01.860 --> 2:48:05.540]  no i'm just saying that from finding that information no no that was actually
[2:48:05.540 --> 2:48:08.580]  investigated by national television and that's not true
[2:48:08.580 --> 2:48:11.940]  he was first in the underwater demolition corps and then he was in the navy
[2:48:11.940 --> 2:48:16.500]  seals well that's the training with navy seals as you know he was first
[2:48:16.500 --> 2:48:20.180]  in that do you have any points to make sir use to talk about about
[2:48:20.180 --> 2:48:24.420]  jesse ventura that's fine if you want to okay well i use that as an opportunity
[2:48:24.420 --> 2:48:27.540]  to give him a bunch of information pertaining gulf war illness
[2:48:27.540 --> 2:48:30.900]  he said yeah he's on board and stuff so
[2:48:30.900 --> 2:48:35.620]  um when he became governor i asked him also what he was going to do for the
[2:48:35.620 --> 2:48:38.340]  minnesota veterans that have gulf war illness
[2:48:38.340 --> 2:48:42.980]  and then i got to the point of where i wrote my wheelchair across the state of
[2:48:42.980 --> 2:48:47.060]  minnesota because of gulf war illness and trying to
[2:48:47.060 --> 2:48:50.500]  bring awareness where i gave him numerous letters
[2:48:50.500 --> 2:48:55.940]  certified letters he promised me that he would meet me at the end of my ride
[2:48:55.940 --> 2:49:01.860]  it took me 11 days of over 15 hours a day to ride my wheelchair across the state
[2:49:01.860 --> 2:49:05.540]  of minnesota when i got there at the capital
[2:49:05.540 --> 2:49:10.500]  he didn't have the gum should even descend any representatives from his
[2:49:10.500 --> 2:49:14.180]  office jesse ventura is a snake in the grass
[2:49:14.180 --> 2:49:17.700]  when the people of brooklyn park got him in there they were
[2:49:17.700 --> 2:49:22.420]  waiting to get him out he lied to the people he lied to the college students
[2:49:22.420 --> 2:49:26.580]  claiming all of these promises and that it never did anything when he was here
[2:49:26.580 --> 2:49:30.580]  you know and i appreciate your call i'm really sorry that he didn't meet you
[2:49:30.580 --> 2:49:33.460]  outside and i'm really sorry that he didn't give you
[2:49:33.460 --> 2:49:36.500]  enough attention uh and i have no doubt that jesse
[2:49:36.500 --> 2:49:40.740]  ventura isn't perfect and i don't completely trust him either
[2:49:40.740 --> 2:49:45.060]  all i've tried to do is help help the gulf war veterans and have guessed on to
[2:49:45.060 --> 2:49:48.900]  expose it and done everything i can in my own meager way
[2:49:48.900 --> 2:49:54.100]  you know i have given um tens of thousands of dollars quietly to the
[2:49:54.100 --> 2:49:58.340]  9-11 victims i haven't really talked about that but i think i might just
[2:49:58.340 --> 2:50:01.620]  go ahead and do it because then i get these idiot emails about why don't you
[2:50:01.620 --> 2:50:05.540]  help the 9-11 people and then even after i've given some of the victims money
[2:50:05.540 --> 2:50:08.580]  they still griping complain and kind of have this i'm owed something
[2:50:08.580 --> 2:50:12.660]  look i didn't do anything to you and uh...
[2:50:12.660 --> 2:50:16.580]  jesse ventura i'm never gonna lady got really mad at me once
[2:50:16.580 --> 2:50:21.620]  when jeb bush was governor i get this really mad email and she says you
[2:50:21.620 --> 2:50:28.740]  didn't email me back but but governor bush did
[2:50:28.740 --> 2:50:32.740]  and then she even called the show and i said ma'am
[2:50:32.740 --> 2:50:35.540]  that isn't really from the governor that's someone saying they're from the
[2:50:35.540 --> 2:50:38.500]  governor she said no it's him and you didn't email me back
[2:50:38.500 --> 2:50:43.860]  do you know what it's like to be busy i mean you know
[2:50:43.860 --> 2:50:47.060]  i'm sure he got covered up that's just not fair to say he's all these bad
[2:50:47.060 --> 2:50:50.020]  things because he didn't meet you it is a big
[2:50:50.020 --> 2:50:55.140]  idea a new world order in the near future
