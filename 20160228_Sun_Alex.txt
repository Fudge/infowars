[00:00.000 --> 00:15.600]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:15.600 --> 00:22.120]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[00:22.120 --> 00:25.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:25.600 --> 00:32.880]  They say there's no rest for the wicked, but about rest for the Patriots.
[00:32.880 --> 00:38.000]  I hope more than seven days a week in the last few weeks because there's just so much
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.280]  news, so much developing.
[00:39.280 --> 00:42.280]  Our story was the top story over the weekend at Drudge.
[00:42.280 --> 00:50.360]  Cruz told Rubio that he will drop out if he's given the Supreme Court appointment.
[00:50.360 --> 00:53.160]  That's directly from high-level sources, we're going to be breaking down.
[00:53.160 --> 00:58.040]  The story at the top on Drudge is Insider, Leakes, Koch Brothers, Rubio Planned to stop
[00:58.040 --> 00:59.040]  Trump.
[00:59.040 --> 01:00.040]  It's all coming up after the break.
[01:00.040 --> 01:01.040]  It's huge.
[01:01.040 --> 01:04.560]  It can change the course of the election, but first, a John Bowne report on the globalist
[01:04.560 --> 01:06.440]  trying to break America's will.
[01:06.440 --> 01:08.440]  The New World Order Crime Syndicate.
[01:08.440 --> 01:09.920]  Oh, pardon me.
[01:09.920 --> 01:13.720]  World leaders are pulling out the stops to lecture the American people.
[01:13.720 --> 01:19.640]  The Pope is demanding Americans allow an invasion of disease, crime and terror into our country.
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.840]  Meanwhile, Sweden and Norway are on the verge of collapse due to the full-scale migrant
[01:24.840 --> 01:43.840]  invasion of Europe.
[01:43.840 --> 01:52.360]  And our largest debt holder, China, who owns 8% or $1.2 trillion in publicly held U.S.
[01:52.360 --> 01:58.480]  debt, has warned the United States not to adopt punitive currency policies that could disrupt
[01:58.480 --> 02:00.440]  U.S.-China relations.
[02:00.440 --> 02:06.440]  Money Morning reports the Red Dragon's cautionary advice came after GOP favorite Donald Trump
[02:06.440 --> 02:14.600]  won Nevada's caucus with a landslide 45.9% of the vote and 14 of its 30 delegates.
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.360]  In a statement made overnight, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters
[02:20.360 --> 02:25.680]  in Beijing that we are following with interest the U.S. presidential election.
[02:25.680 --> 02:29.880]  And now former Mexican President Vicente Fox is lecturing America.
[02:29.880 --> 02:35.560]  He knows Mexico needs the U.S. when it comes to trade, just the way the U.S. needs Mexico.
[02:35.560 --> 02:41.840]  I have to say, if we're not, I am not going to pay for that wall, I am not.
[02:41.840 --> 02:48.360]  So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 or $10 or $12 billion,
[02:48.360 --> 02:53.160]  whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?
[02:53.160 --> 02:57.960]  I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.
[02:57.960 --> 03:02.320]  This is the same New World Order criminal that pushed the merge of the United States
[03:02.320 --> 03:03.320]  with Mexico.
[03:03.320 --> 03:09.120]  Kit Daniels writes, Fox wanted the U.S. to join Mexico and Canada into an EU-style North
[03:09.120 --> 03:14.360]  American Union, which would combine all three countries into one regional government using
[03:14.360 --> 03:21.240]  one currency, like the Euro, at the expense of both U.S. national sovereignty and individual
[03:21.240 --> 03:22.240]  rights.
[03:22.240 --> 03:28.200]  Vicente wrote in his autobiography, Revolution of Hope, I proposed a NAFTA-plus plan to President
[03:28.200 --> 03:33.600]  Bush and Canada's prime minister to move us toward a single continental economic union
[03:33.600 --> 03:35.920]  modeled on the European example.
[03:35.920 --> 03:41.920]  At summits, I took every opportunity to advocate clearly for free market policies, showing
[03:41.920 --> 03:48.160]  what sound economics could do to fund social justice, arguing for globalism and the free
[03:48.160 --> 03:50.560]  trade area of the Americas.
[03:50.560 --> 03:57.200]  In concert with Vicente Fox, the CFR proposed increased labor mobility between the U.S.
[03:57.200 --> 04:03.560]  and Mexico, which would effectively grant amnesty to illegal immigrants and a North American
[04:03.560 --> 04:10.280]  regulatory plan with a unified approach to all three countries, which would effectively
[04:10.280 --> 04:13.280]  end U.S. national sovereignty.
[04:13.280 --> 04:18.600]  Meanwhile, our government continues to persecute from within as the Republican presidential
[04:18.600 --> 04:23.640]  candidates express their dismay with being audited by the IRS.
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.200]  We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong.
[04:28.200 --> 04:33.480]  You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the national prayer breakfast.
[04:33.480 --> 04:36.240]  I'm always audited by the IRS.
[04:36.240 --> 04:42.240]  And as the new world order mouthpieces, excuse me, and as the world leaders lash out against
[04:42.240 --> 04:48.280]  a populist blowback to their domination of planet Earth, how long before they push yet
[04:48.280 --> 04:54.440]  another button to get their agenda moving in the right direction, John Bowne for Enforce.com.
[05:18.280 --> 05:34.520]  We're introducing the best yet the brand new Pro Pure Pro Max high performance shower

[06:09.880 --> 06:26.480]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:26.480 --> 06:29.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very important transmission.
[06:29.760 --> 06:39.720]  They're all important, but this one particularly, the 28th day of February 2016, I am your
[06:39.720 --> 06:40.720]  host.
[06:40.720 --> 06:45.320]  And here we are with leap year upon us.
[06:45.320 --> 06:50.360]  Roger Stone, the consummate, Trump insider, his good friend of 40 plus years, his former
[06:50.360 --> 06:58.720]  campaign head, who Trump tweeted about Saturday that we pull up Trump's tweet on him in a
[06:58.720 --> 07:04.560]  moment where he said Roger Stone has been banned from CNN.
[07:04.560 --> 07:07.560]  He is a patriot.
[07:07.560 --> 07:08.880]  He is basically a friend.
[07:08.880 --> 07:09.880]  He is tough.
[07:09.880 --> 07:10.880]  He is loyal.
[07:10.880 --> 07:14.520]  That just gives you an example of what Donald Trump thinks about Mr. Stone, and he left
[07:14.520 --> 07:18.240]  the campaign six months ago so that he could basically do things the way he specifically
[07:18.240 --> 07:25.120]  wanted to, but be separate from the rest of the Trump camp, who he gets along with fine.
[07:25.120 --> 07:27.560]  And I've known him for about 10 years as a top JFK researcher.
[07:27.560 --> 07:35.440]  I knew he'd been a top Politico before that, but he is an influence on Trump, giving him
[07:35.440 --> 07:37.280]  research material and information.
[07:37.280 --> 07:43.240]  And you see Trump coming out about the 28 pages in 9-11, and Trump coming out about political
[07:43.240 --> 07:46.920]  correctness and censorship, and Trump coming out and saying he'll indict Hillary if he's
[07:46.920 --> 07:51.800]  elected, and Trump coming out and saying China can't have one-sided trade deals.
[07:51.800 --> 07:56.480]  Those are his own research and experiences, but it's also a lot of the research that Stone
[07:56.480 --> 07:58.000]  is working on.
[07:58.000 --> 08:04.040]  And Stone was obviously in studio for two hours on Friday with us.
[08:04.040 --> 08:13.440]  And then, of course, we went out to dinner Friday, and he kept getting up and going outside
[08:13.440 --> 08:18.080]  to take phone calls, and he would come back knowing that I'm in the media so he can tell
[08:18.080 --> 08:19.920]  me things without me repeating it.
[08:19.920 --> 08:24.320]  He told me a lot of amazing things, and so much what he's told me in the past ends up
[08:24.320 --> 08:26.400]  happening a few weeks later.
[08:26.400 --> 08:30.160]  Like he said, look for Trump to come out against the Federal Reserve and call for it to be
[08:30.160 --> 08:31.160]  audited.
[08:31.160 --> 08:32.160]  It happened the next Monday.
[08:32.160 --> 08:34.680]  He was on that Friday two weeks ago.
[08:34.680 --> 08:36.280]  Look for him to call for indicting Hillary.
[08:36.280 --> 08:39.000]  It happened.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.120]  It's amazing.
[08:41.120 --> 08:45.480]  I learned why Trump exposes vaccines, but I'm not allowed to tell you.
[08:45.480 --> 08:48.680]  The folks can probably figure it out for themselves.
[08:48.680 --> 08:54.400]  How many people have had bad experiences with him?
[08:54.400 --> 09:03.760]  And so much of what he told me, I can't repeat, like look for Senator Sessions to endorse Trump.
[09:03.760 --> 09:05.760]  That's now the top story on DrudgeReport.com.
[09:05.760 --> 09:09.200]  Now I can say it because it's already happened to come out.
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.800]  The vaunted siren is up there right now, and Trump is live in Alabama.
[09:13.800 --> 09:14.800]  Get ready for that to happen.
[09:14.800 --> 09:18.800]  Chris Christie just obviously endorsed him on Friday.
[09:18.800 --> 09:25.200]  Now, what was on DrudgeReport.com since yesterday, but just got rolled off?
[09:25.200 --> 09:26.200]  It was this headline.
[09:26.200 --> 09:31.000]  Then I'll get to the new news that's even bigger.
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.320]  Bombshell, insider leaks, Koch brothers, Rubio plan to stop Trump.
[09:37.320 --> 09:41.360]  Now it was in political on Friday that 200 top Republican millionaires and billionaires
[09:41.360 --> 09:53.320]  met in New York with Rubio and obviously Roger Stone is from New York and Connecticut and
[09:53.320 --> 09:58.160]  a big political insider and he had the sources and he said, boy, I tell you scary news.
[09:58.160 --> 10:00.840]  We can still defeat it because the Koch brothers don't know what they're doing.
[10:00.840 --> 10:03.400]  They just spend money everywhere and don't target it.
[10:03.400 --> 10:05.200]  75 million that they and others gave.
[10:05.200 --> 10:06.640]  In fact, the number is bigger than that.
[10:06.640 --> 10:12.720]  I said, let's just say 75 million and they're going to get fully behind Rubio and basically
[10:12.720 --> 10:13.720]  Cruz is done.
[10:13.720 --> 10:18.000]  They're not giving him anything, which is almost a positive for Cruz that the Koch brothers
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.680]  don't want him either.
[10:20.680 --> 10:23.760]  The Texas senator.
[10:23.760 --> 10:26.840]  And then of course, since this came out yesterday, it's actually come out in the news and indeed
[10:26.840 --> 10:27.840]  that happened.
[10:27.840 --> 10:33.600]  So Stone is continuing to give us very, very accurate information.
[10:33.600 --> 10:38.120]  Now after dinner, we went out as if two hours in the radio wasn't enough that day.
[10:38.120 --> 10:41.280]  I said, let's do a Facebook mentions on the streets of downtown Austin after we ate at
[10:41.280 --> 10:42.280]  Lambert's barbecue.
[10:42.280 --> 10:48.800]  I don't know any stock in it, but man, is it gourmet.
[10:48.800 --> 10:51.920]  And we come outside and I say, it was really nice lighting those pools of light over there
[10:51.920 --> 10:52.920]  by that shop.
[10:52.920 --> 10:55.800]  Let's do a 10 minute Facebook mentions.
[10:55.800 --> 11:00.440]  Can you talk about any of the things that you just basically discussed in there?
[11:00.440 --> 11:03.920]  And he said, yeah, I'll talk about the fact that the Koch brothers are doing all this
[11:03.920 --> 11:07.400]  and the fact that you're trying to buy the election and that shows the establishment
[11:07.400 --> 11:12.320]  truly is against Trump.
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.280]  But he said, I'm not ready to talk about what I told you about the Supreme Court.
[11:17.280 --> 11:19.560]  And I said, okay.
[11:19.560 --> 11:24.000]  And then I talked to him on the phone, well, I introduced him in a specific last night,
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.160]  but I talked to him on the phone before he took off this morning and he should be back
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.160]  in New York soon.
[11:30.160 --> 11:35.520]  But he made me able to pop in today, tonight, if not tomorrow.
[11:35.520 --> 11:38.240]  And he said, you know what?
[11:38.240 --> 11:42.120]  It's going to come out about the Supreme Court situation, at least part of it.
[11:42.120 --> 11:46.080]  So you can talk about this part of it, but don't talk about the other two thirds I told
[11:46.080 --> 11:47.080]  you.
[11:47.080 --> 11:49.400]  And then I may be able to break it on your show tomorrow.
[11:49.400 --> 11:50.680]  So we're waiting.
[11:50.680 --> 11:52.280]  But here is the big news.
[11:52.280 --> 11:54.520]  I shot a Facebook mentions right before I went on air today.
[11:54.520 --> 11:55.520]  It's on info wars.com.
[11:55.520 --> 11:56.920]  We have an HD version.
[11:56.920 --> 12:02.680]  We shot this being uploaded right now, it'll be added to this story and that we will put
[12:02.680 --> 12:07.040]  up on info wars.com and on our YouTube and Facebook and everywhere else that needs to
[12:07.040 --> 12:08.040]  go mega viral.
[12:08.040 --> 12:12.640]  It's a big deal to have the Koch brothers trying to buy this election and basically
[12:12.640 --> 12:19.080]  saying they're not going to be for Cruz or Trump.
[12:19.080 --> 12:22.000]  I was told the entire story.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  Names you name it.
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  I mean, it's amazing.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.120]  But I'm going to leave it at that as we careful here to not tell any parts I wasn't supposed
[12:30.120 --> 12:31.840]  to.
[12:31.840 --> 12:39.960]  But Roger Stone, Consument Trump insider, confidant, talked directly to not one, not two, but three
[12:39.960 --> 12:40.960]  top people.
[12:40.960 --> 12:41.960]  It's all very incestuous.
[12:41.960 --> 12:45.680]  I mean, it's all a club, even though they're fighting with each other.
[12:45.680 --> 12:46.680]  It's political operatives.
[12:46.680 --> 12:49.000]  They all know each other for decades.
[12:49.000 --> 13:00.720]  And Cruz had his top lawyer call up Rubio Friday during the day and said, if you will
[13:00.720 --> 13:05.160]  give me the Supreme Court nomination, I will throw all my support behind you.
[13:05.160 --> 13:08.880]  Now, this is according to Roger Stone and I think he's a good source.
[13:08.880 --> 13:15.440]  I think he's truthful, but I'm not saying that that's a report from Roger Stone, not
[13:15.440 --> 13:16.440]  from Alex Jones.
[13:16.440 --> 13:17.440]  I want to be clear.
[13:17.440 --> 13:20.000]  He authorized me to tell you.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.520]  And that is so big on so many fronts that sounds like Illinois politics.
[13:23.520 --> 13:33.640]  I mean, I don't even know if that's legal to say, I think it's once you're in office,
[13:33.640 --> 13:34.640]  you can't do that.
[13:34.640 --> 13:37.520]  I think in a campaign from I was trying to read today, I've got a pretty good political
[13:37.520 --> 13:38.520]  savvy.
[13:38.520 --> 13:39.520]  I think it is legal.
[13:39.520 --> 13:42.880]  That's very unethical in my view, if true.
[13:42.880 --> 13:48.240]  So I believe Stone, so either Cruz's people are putting this out for whatever reason.
[13:48.240 --> 13:49.760]  There's a lot of subterfuge.
[13:49.760 --> 13:51.800]  It goes on a lot of dirty tricks internally.
[13:51.800 --> 13:52.800]  A lot of sabotage.
[13:52.800 --> 13:53.800]  Who knows?
[13:53.800 --> 13:56.320]  We got to look at that.
[13:56.320 --> 13:57.320]  Or it's true.
[13:57.320 --> 14:00.760]  And the way this lawyer has operated, the way he was George Herbert Walker Bush's, you
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.120]  know, in his top guys, his wife, Goldman Sachs, all of it, he knows the Koch brothers
[14:05.120 --> 14:06.120]  lined up against him.
[14:06.120 --> 14:07.320]  He's sliding fast in the polls.
[14:07.320 --> 14:11.560]  It would be a good position for him to position himself in.
[14:11.560 --> 14:13.080]  And so he needs to answer the question.
[14:13.080 --> 14:15.240]  The press needs to ask Ted Cruz.
[14:15.240 --> 14:16.240]  Is this true?
[14:16.240 --> 14:17.240]  What Roger Stone says?
[14:17.240 --> 14:20.080]  It's on infowars.com.
[14:20.080 --> 14:24.800]  And so that's the $64 trillion question right now.
[14:24.800 --> 14:25.800]  But it's a big deal.
[14:25.800 --> 14:29.240]  I mean, how would that affect Texas voters and other Super Tuesday voters coming up next
[14:29.240 --> 14:32.400]  week in just two, three days?
[14:32.400 --> 14:39.720]  As it comes out, that reportedly Ted Cruz is shopping us around to Marco Rubio.
[14:39.720 --> 14:43.480]  I think it's fair to say, I bet he's shopped at some other places, but I, who knows, maybe
[14:43.480 --> 14:46.080]  that will come out.
[14:46.080 --> 14:52.000]  Maybe other little birds were saying that, but boy, I tell you, I wish I could tell all
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.280]  the stuff I was told because the third time, the fifth time, the 10th time, something Stone
[14:57.280 --> 14:59.520]  tells me comes completely true.
[14:59.520 --> 15:03.360]  The 15th or 20th time, you really start listening to him and his name's on this.
[15:03.360 --> 15:06.200]  I mean, he wouldn't be putting this out for no reason.
[15:06.200 --> 15:08.760]  It's a big deal regardless.
[15:08.760 --> 15:12.520]  The story of the video is up on infowars.com.
[15:12.520 --> 15:15.800]  I shot a special report on this that hasn't even uploaded to YouTube yet.
[15:15.800 --> 15:17.920]  It's being uploaded right now, but we already have it.
[15:17.920 --> 15:19.240]  It's now uploaded into our systems.
[15:19.240 --> 15:20.720]  I just shot it before I went live.
[15:20.720 --> 15:21.720]  So it's focused.
[15:21.720 --> 15:24.240]  I'm going to come back and play this report.
[15:24.240 --> 15:26.480]  It's about five minutes long, right CJ?
[15:26.480 --> 15:27.480]  Okay.
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.600]  And it's got some clips of the previous interview Friday with Stone that have gone viral.
[15:31.600 --> 15:33.880]  We'll come back, play that out of the break.
[15:33.880 --> 15:39.440]  And I'm going to get into all the other big news Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Trump,
[15:39.440 --> 15:45.840]  Senator Sessions set to endorse him ahead of Super Tuesday, according to DrudgeReport.com.
[15:45.840 --> 15:49.240]  I was seeing now info wars in comments today.
[15:49.240 --> 15:53.320]  I think it's an obvious choice when he's there to speak with sessions, but a drudge has the
[15:53.320 --> 15:56.960]  intel that it's imminent with the siren going wild.

[20:01.760 --> 20:11.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:11.600 --> 20:29.760]  All right, I'm on the phone with Roger Stone right now and he's probably going to be popping
[20:29.760 --> 20:30.760]  in.
[20:30.760 --> 20:35.280]  He's on Fifth Avenue in a taxi because I want you to hear him since I've been green-minded
[20:35.280 --> 20:36.280]  to talk about this.
[20:36.280 --> 20:37.280]  Just hear it from him directly.
[20:37.280 --> 20:41.520]  I'm going to air this piece that we're premiering right now that I shot, break him while this
[20:41.520 --> 20:45.280]  is so big down, and then we'll see if he's going to be on right after that probably.
[20:45.280 --> 20:48.440]  I've got to give him the hotline number, so let's go ahead and go to this report.
[20:48.440 --> 21:03.280]  You're watching and listening to the Alex Jones show.
[21:03.280 --> 21:08.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with some of the most important political news
[21:08.600 --> 21:10.200]  of the 2016 race.
[21:10.200 --> 21:12.200]  This is over-the-top info.
[21:12.200 --> 21:18.400]  We'll put it on screen for viewers, but Drudge in the last 24 hours has been top-linked to
[21:18.400 --> 21:24.320]  our exclusive interview with the consummate Trump insider, Roger Stone, a veteran inside
[21:24.320 --> 21:27.320]  four administrations, but he's worked for nine presidents that have been involved in
[21:27.320 --> 21:29.640]  nine major campaigns.
[21:29.640 --> 21:35.080]  He is the former campaign chairman for Trump and one of his top advisors.
[21:35.080 --> 21:36.880]  Stone has been in Austin for the last two and a half days.
[21:36.880 --> 21:39.000]  He left back to New York this morning.
[21:39.000 --> 21:45.760]  Now, he broke the news on Friday of what happened inside that secret meeting Thursday night in
[21:45.760 --> 21:52.080]  New York with 200 top Republican donors that Politico reported on, that $75 million was
[21:52.080 --> 21:57.120]  given by the Koch brothers who buy the Republicans and Democrats to try to stop Trump and back
[21:57.120 --> 21:59.840]  Marco Rubio.
[21:59.840 --> 22:04.520]  Now that's huge news, and it's all over the press right now, but here's what's even
[22:04.520 --> 22:05.720]  bigger.
[22:05.720 --> 22:09.600]  He was not ready at that time, but talking to him yesterday, he said, no, I'm ready
[22:09.600 --> 22:14.920]  now for you to talk about the next piece, and he's going to be on the show in the next
[22:14.920 --> 22:18.200]  24 hours to break it down in detail.
[22:18.200 --> 22:21.160]  And I have Richard Reeves coming on the show today who was there at the meeting to break
[22:21.160 --> 22:22.960]  all this down as well, our political correspondent.
[22:22.960 --> 22:27.240]  We've been authorized to talk about some of it, not all of it, because it's so dangerous.
[22:27.240 --> 22:35.920]  Now get ready for this, according to Roger Stone, who directly talked to the top people
[22:35.920 --> 22:43.560]  in three other campaigns, his campaign and the other two, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.
[22:43.560 --> 22:54.640]  Ted Cruz had a lawyer, high-powered lawyer, call up Marco Rubio and say, Ted Cruz is ready
[22:54.640 --> 23:02.400]  to drop out if you promise to nominate him for the Supreme Court of the United States.
[23:02.400 --> 23:09.280]  And let's just say this, some other phone calls are being made as well around the same
[23:09.280 --> 23:10.280]  lines.
[23:10.280 --> 23:18.320]  People don't trust Cruz one bit, and Marco Rubio told him, absolutely no, reportedly.
[23:18.320 --> 23:21.960]  And he's already talked about the wives calling each other and asking people to drop out and
[23:21.960 --> 23:29.760]  the rest of it, but this is unprecedented because Cruz knows the entire Republican leadership,
[23:29.760 --> 23:33.160]  the Koch brothers, Fox News, who's lost half their viewers the last few months attacking
[23:33.160 --> 23:38.800]  Trump, their stories on that breaking it down, are going to go for Marco Rubio, and they may
[23:38.800 --> 23:43.760]  even put him into the presidency, or he may be a shell and take a dive for Hillary, and
[23:43.760 --> 23:48.000]  Hillary, of course, just swept in South Carolina, 50% of the vote, I mean, this is a big deal.
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.520]  So this is epic information.
[23:51.520 --> 23:57.360]  There's a lot of legalese involved here, but this is unprecedented information, and it's
[23:57.360 --> 24:01.000]  coming from somebody that's never steered us wrong, it's huge.
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.720]  So regardless, we need to see this in the news, and Stone obviously is going to be out there
[24:07.720 --> 24:13.280]  in the press, talking about the fact that from high level sources inside the campaigns,
[24:13.280 --> 24:16.320]  this happened, and there's a lot more to this.
[24:16.320 --> 24:17.320]  There's a lot more to this.
[24:17.320 --> 24:21.960]  I mean, do you think that if he was going to make that call to somebody, Teddy Cruz was,
[24:21.960 --> 24:25.320]  do you think that would only be to that person?
[24:25.320 --> 24:34.040]  This is big, and if it comes out that the Koch brothers who are universally reviled is
[24:34.040 --> 24:39.240]  trying to destroy Trump, and if it comes out that Cruz knows that the establishment won't
[24:39.240 --> 24:45.120]  put up with him, but wants a Supreme Court seat, and is basically trying to drop out
[24:45.120 --> 24:50.920]  to catapult Rubio, perhaps into the lead, for that seat, it needs to be investigated.
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.760]  And if people inside the Cruz campaign are telling Roger Stone stuff, is it true?
[24:55.760 --> 24:58.880]  Ted Cruz, I think he's done a lot of great things for the Second Amendment, you name
[24:58.880 --> 25:03.120]  it, needs to come out and say this is incorrect, and we're ready with that Ted Cruz on before
[25:03.120 --> 25:06.640]  to have him come on, or his campaign, and address this.
[25:06.640 --> 25:09.520]  But info wars is the new independent media.
[25:09.520 --> 25:13.720]  We are leading the charge, tens of millions of viewers and listeners today, and the establishment
[25:13.720 --> 25:15.520]  media is not going to be able to ignore this.
[25:15.520 --> 25:20.360]  Donald Trump is a focal point of the grassroots awakening that's taking place and happening.
[25:20.360 --> 25:21.440]  And so are we.
[25:21.440 --> 25:24.440]  And the more we're ignored, the more we're attacked, they're trying to not even let
[25:24.440 --> 25:27.880]  us into the RNC and DNC coming up, like refusing his press passes right now.
[25:27.880 --> 25:31.080]  How is it the RNC and DNC 10, 12, 14 years?
[25:31.080 --> 25:32.520]  I've been at all of them.
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.160]  That's now that we're so successful and reach millions of people every day that say, oh,
[25:37.160 --> 25:38.520]  you're not media.
[25:38.520 --> 25:40.520]  That's because they're so incredibly scared.
[25:40.520 --> 25:44.400]  It's like Obama saying, oh, Trump isn't eligible.
[25:44.400 --> 25:45.880]  Trump, Trump, Trump is disqualified.
[25:45.880 --> 25:47.360]  He isn't a real candidate.
[25:47.360 --> 25:49.760]  You people don't control reality anymore.
[25:49.760 --> 25:51.360]  So get ready.
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.560]  Coming up on the radio show today and tomorrow for us to break all of this down in detail
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.280]  with Roger Stone and more info wars.com forward slash show for all the details.
[26:00.280 --> 26:01.480]  I'm Alex Jones.
[26:01.480 --> 26:05.000]  If you're watching this transmission or listening to it, folks, you're just as important as
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.160]  I am or Donald Trump or anybody else or Ron Paul.
[26:08.160 --> 26:10.160]  You are the resist.
[26:10.160 --> 26:12.880]  Okay, folks, we're live.
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.600]  I am talking to Roger Stone right now and we are all over the map.
[26:17.600 --> 26:20.840]  So, so what I want to do right now is talk about Super Tuesday coming up.
[26:20.840 --> 26:25.960]  I want to talk about the Supreme Court situation and I'm going to go to break and talk to Stone
[26:25.960 --> 26:27.640]  for the three minute break because I need to.
[26:27.640 --> 26:31.880]  He was just on the phone getting back to his house for 45 minutes with Donald Trump.
[26:31.880 --> 26:34.080]  So that's why he was unable to come on earlier.
[26:34.080 --> 26:37.240]  So we've got a whole bunch of key stuff coming up.
[26:37.240 --> 26:39.760]  So Roger, I want to be careful about everything we were just talking about.
[26:39.760 --> 26:40.760]  I agree.
[26:40.760 --> 26:43.280]  So I want to talk to you during the break before we go public with some of this other
[26:43.280 --> 26:45.040]  breaking news.
[26:45.040 --> 26:49.840]  But let's just start right now with a Supreme Court situation with the report that you told
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.000]  me I could green light, which we've now launched Roger Stone, Trump confidant.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.960]  Look, I think, I think Trump is, he's always been a law and order guy and people want to
[27:00.960 --> 27:03.000]  know what kind of judges he would he pick.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.040]  Well, first of all, he is getting the short legal advice, just session, one of the great
[27:07.040 --> 27:13.120]  patriots in the U.S. Senate, a guy who understands the immigration problem inside now, which
[27:13.120 --> 27:17.440]  shows kind of president he would be because he would pick excellent people and even listen
[27:17.440 --> 27:18.440]  to them.
[27:18.440 --> 27:22.360]  And he would, he would be so I don't think Trump claims to know everything.
[27:22.360 --> 27:25.640]  But he hasn't been in politics like these career politicians do.
[27:25.640 --> 27:32.120]  He's been building opportunity and prosperity for a lot of people and making himself incredibly
[27:32.120 --> 27:33.120]  wealthy.
[27:33.120 --> 27:38.800]  Now he's being harassed by the IRS, the same IRS that has multiple complaints about the
[27:38.800 --> 27:39.800]  law breaking going on.
[27:39.800 --> 27:45.240]  Depends on the foundation, but chooses to look the other way and at least 20 Republican
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.520]  attorney generals who've been presented the same information that they have authority
[27:49.520 --> 27:54.680]  over charities, Alex, and not a single Republican attorney general has had the guts to start
[27:54.680 --> 27:55.680]  to investigate.
[27:55.680 --> 27:56.680]  What is it?
[27:56.680 --> 27:57.680]  $2 billion global fraud.
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.520]  Meanwhile, they're harassing Donald Trump, an honest businessman whose tax bill would
[28:02.520 --> 28:04.480]  probably blow all of our minds.
[28:04.480 --> 28:09.080]  It just shows, you know, it shows you how out of control the IRS is, which of course is
[28:09.080 --> 28:11.280]  a core part of the Trump message.
[28:11.280 --> 28:16.000]  Well, there's so much unfolding, we're going to break here in a moment and come back and
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  talk about.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.480]  There's 35,000 people waiting for Donald Trump to give a speech now, 35,000 people.
[28:21.480 --> 28:23.480]  This is an insurrection, Alex.
[28:23.480 --> 28:24.480]  This is an uprising.
[28:24.480 --> 28:30.480]  And it's a big deal to have Senator Sessions, Drudge says that Sessions is about to endorse
[28:30.480 --> 28:31.480]  Trump.
[28:31.480 --> 28:32.960]  Is that the case?
[28:32.960 --> 28:35.200]  I believe that to be the case.
[28:35.200 --> 28:39.400]  I didn't know what the timing was, I knew the agreement to support him.
[28:39.400 --> 28:44.720]  Trump is a great admirer of Sessions and, you know, Trump is showing the only leadership
[28:44.720 --> 28:45.720]  on Sessions.
[28:45.720 --> 28:46.720]  Sure.
[28:46.720 --> 28:47.720]  Boom.
[28:47.720 --> 28:48.720]  Drudge is, Drudge is right as usual.
[28:48.720 --> 28:49.720]  Stay there, Roger Stone.
[28:49.720 --> 28:50.720]  I know you're a tired guy.
[28:50.720 --> 28:51.720]  Just got off the plane.
[28:51.720 --> 28:52.720]  Just got home.
[28:52.720 --> 28:53.720]  I want to come back.
[28:53.720 --> 28:55.320]  Go over some big breaking news with you straight ahead.
[28:55.320 --> 28:56.320]  Thank you, sir.
[28:56.320 --> 28:57.320]  We'll be back.
[28:57.320 --> 29:13.600]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[29:13.600 --> 29:16.660]  And I really want to do a good job on the interview.
[29:16.660 --> 29:18.480]  I got my bottle of brain force right there.
[29:18.480 --> 29:23.520]  I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears
[29:23.520 --> 29:24.520]  up.
[29:24.520 --> 29:25.520]  It's got four and a half stars.
[29:25.520 --> 29:26.520]  People really love it.
[29:26.520 --> 29:28.800]  Read about it, find out why third-party
[29:28.800 --> 29:30.960]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[29:30.960 --> 29:34.440]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[29:34.440 --> 29:36.440]  that will blow your socks off.
[29:36.440 --> 29:37.960]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[29:37.960 --> 29:40.480]  but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[29:40.480 --> 29:42.880]  I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[29:42.880 --> 29:44.600]  took three hours of sleep, got up,
[29:44.600 --> 29:46.640]  took two more Brainforce and came in.
[29:46.640 --> 29:50.200]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products
[29:50.200 --> 29:59.360]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[29:59.360 --> 30:03.040]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[30:03.040 --> 30:05.880]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[30:05.880 --> 30:09.160]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
[30:09.160 --> 30:10.800]  and prepare a defense.
[30:10.800 --> 30:13.880]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces
[30:13.880 --> 30:16.360]  were approaching filled with bombs,
[30:16.360 --> 30:19.480]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[30:19.480 --> 30:22.640]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons
[30:22.640 --> 30:23.840]  for quiet war.
[30:23.840 --> 30:26.360]  Pathenogens added to the food and water,
[30:26.360 --> 30:29.480]  to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[30:29.480 --> 30:32.600]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey
[30:32.600 --> 30:33.640]  towards death.
[30:33.640 --> 30:37.080]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[30:37.080 --> 30:41.800]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated
[30:41.800 --> 30:45.080]  herbs to create the basic foundation
[30:45.080 --> 30:48.280]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[30:54.240 --> 30:57.800]  and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[30:57.800 --> 31:01.240]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[31:03.400 --> 31:06.520]  focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[31:06.520 --> 31:09.520]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[32:54.520 --> 32:56.080]  Check it out for yourself today.
[33:01.280 --> 33:04.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:04.240 --> 33:11.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[33:11.240 --> 33:17.000]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.240]  Donald Trump has the Chinese government,
[33:19.240 --> 33:21.240]  the biggest murderers in history, saying,
[33:21.240 --> 33:23.240]  America, you don't derelict him.
[33:23.240 --> 33:25.240]  We have the former Mexican government
[33:25.240 --> 33:27.240]  and we have the American government.
[33:27.240 --> 33:28.240]  We have the American government.
[33:28.240 --> 33:29.240]  We have the American government.
[33:29.240 --> 33:30.240]  We have the American government.
[33:30.240 --> 33:31.240]  We have the American government.
[33:31.240 --> 33:34.240]  America, you don't derelect him.
[33:34.240 --> 33:35.240]  We have the former Mexican president,
[33:35.240 --> 33:37.240]  Vicente Fox, cussing on TV, saying,
[33:37.240 --> 33:40.240]  how dare you want to have sovereignty?
[33:40.240 --> 33:41.240]  We've got the Democratic Party,
[33:41.240 --> 33:43.240]  the Republican Party leadership, the entire system,
[33:43.240 --> 33:46.240]  the pope with a dead secretary found in his apartment,
[33:46.240 --> 33:48.240]  saying, how dare you have Trump?
[33:48.240 --> 33:49.240]  You know, he's going to hell.
[33:49.240 --> 33:52.240]  It's so obvious the power structure's scared to death.
[33:52.240 --> 33:54.240]  And we have the Trump confidant
[33:54.240 --> 33:56.240]  and inside of the former head of his campaign,
[33:56.240 --> 33:59.240]  Roger Stone, who just left Texas this morning.
[33:59.240 --> 34:01.240]  He is back at his home,
[34:01.240 --> 34:03.240]  and he just talked to Trump for 45 minutes.
[34:03.240 --> 34:04.240]  And so he's got a lot of intel.
[34:04.240 --> 34:07.240]  Let's walk through the new enemy attacks.
[34:07.240 --> 34:09.240]  Number one, the meeting in New York
[34:09.240 --> 34:11.240]  that you broke down, your sources,
[34:11.240 --> 34:14.240]  recap that, the $75 million, the Koch brothers,
[34:14.240 --> 34:17.240]  the Republican establishment that sold us out to China,
[34:17.240 --> 34:20.240]  what they're planning to do to Trump and Marco Rubio,
[34:20.240 --> 34:23.240]  then the big breaking Supreme Court intel, sir.
[34:23.240 --> 34:26.240]  Well, first of all, I'm glad to be back with you.
[34:26.240 --> 34:29.240]  Now, in all honesty, I could never devolve
[34:29.240 --> 34:32.240]  the confidential details of a personal conversation
[34:32.240 --> 34:35.240]  with Donald Trump, as you know.
[34:35.240 --> 34:38.240]  This isn't from Trump. This is from the other campaigns.
[34:38.240 --> 34:41.240]  For 40 years, other than, say, several.
[34:41.240 --> 34:45.240]  One, he has 35,000 people waiting for him on the ground
[34:45.240 --> 34:48.240]  at this upcoming unveiling.
[34:48.240 --> 34:51.240]  Senator Session, who is one of the real leaders
[34:51.240 --> 34:54.240]  in this country on immigration, a patriot,
[34:54.240 --> 34:59.240]  is emerging as Trump's best advisor, as we discussed.
[34:59.240 --> 35:01.240]  He's very pumped up.
[35:01.240 --> 35:08.240]  He knows that this is a fight for a nationalist agenda.
[35:08.240 --> 35:11.240]  He knows this is the biggest uprising in this country
[35:11.240 --> 35:17.240]  since Andrew Jackson gave us a more popular form of freedom.
[35:17.240 --> 35:19.240]  And it's interesting, because, you know,
[35:19.240 --> 35:22.240]  they said that Jackson was crude,
[35:22.240 --> 35:26.240]  and that he wasn't to the man who was born,
[35:26.240 --> 35:28.240]  and that he was blunt.
[35:28.240 --> 35:30.240]  Who did this all sound like?
[35:30.240 --> 35:32.240]  And, of course, as you know, Alex,
[35:32.240 --> 35:34.240]  he was one of our greatest presidents.
[35:34.240 --> 35:36.240]  Absolutely. Just recapping,
[35:36.240 --> 35:38.240]  as it's national news, as you know.
[35:38.240 --> 35:40.240]  The Koch brothers coming,
[35:40.240 --> 35:42.240]  and then let's get into the Supreme Court situation.
[35:42.240 --> 35:44.240]  This is very interesting.
[35:44.240 --> 35:46.240]  One thing I learned, and that is,
[35:46.240 --> 35:48.240]  if you want a bunch of cops to just scramble,
[35:48.240 --> 35:50.240]  you just have to shed light on them.
[35:50.240 --> 35:55.240]  And there's a cabal of billionaires behind Marco Rubio.
[35:55.240 --> 35:59.240]  Marco Rubio has come a very long way since the Senate, right?
[35:59.240 --> 36:02.240]  He has gained a great deal of polish,
[36:02.240 --> 36:05.240]  and I have, he's a decent fellow,
[36:05.240 --> 36:09.240]  but he is the ultimate neocot.
[36:09.240 --> 36:14.240]  He's just Bushism wrapped up in a more attractive Hispanic package
[36:14.240 --> 36:16.240]  with a better salesman.
[36:16.240 --> 36:18.240]  It's extreme Bushism,
[36:18.240 --> 36:21.240]  in terms of adherence to the globalist agenda.
[36:21.240 --> 36:25.240]  Big government, big spending, big debt, big war.
[36:25.240 --> 36:28.240]  He's the third administration. That's why they've been grooming him.
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.240]  Right, you know, and that is,
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.240]  but today, the Norman Brayman,
[36:36.240 --> 36:38.240]  the billionaire car dealer from Miami,
[36:38.240 --> 36:43.240]  Paul Singer, billionaire hedge fund manager from Wall Street,
[36:43.240 --> 36:48.240]  the Koch brothers,
[36:48.240 --> 36:50.240]  and a group of others that they have confident.
[36:50.240 --> 36:55.240]  You see, the Kochs have, among their conservative social friends,
[36:55.240 --> 37:00.240]  an entire group of millionaires and billionaires
[37:00.240 --> 37:04.240]  who also have the same ambitions to control government
[37:04.240 --> 37:06.240]  for their own purposes.
[37:06.240 --> 37:10.240]  So, although you will read in the media, Eric, Alex,
[37:10.240 --> 37:13.240]  that the number they ponied up was 25 million,
[37:13.240 --> 37:16.240]  in fact, if you stop Trump TV onslaught,
[37:16.240 --> 37:21.240]  they will spend at least 75 million.
[37:21.240 --> 37:24.240]  Additionally, this whole canard of Trump University,
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.240]  Trump University had a 98% student approval rating.
[37:28.240 --> 37:31.240]  Now, when Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York,
[37:31.240 --> 37:34.240]  attempted to shake down Trump and his daughter,
[37:34.240 --> 37:37.240]  saying that they have these complaints,
[37:37.240 --> 37:40.240]  they probably just dropped it.
[37:40.240 --> 37:42.240]  By the way, how many tickets are you buying to my fundraiser?
[37:42.240 --> 37:45.240]  And the Trumps did not play ball.
[37:45.240 --> 37:49.240]  He went to court in a very broad and specific action,
[37:49.240 --> 37:52.240]  and he lost on every count.
[37:52.240 --> 37:54.240]  And that's a fact. I mean, this is what they do.
[37:54.240 --> 37:58.240]  It's like the EEOC and all the rest of it's taking people down.
[37:58.240 --> 38:00.240]  But let's expand on this now.
[38:00.240 --> 38:02.240]  So, their TV commercials will feature this,
[38:02.240 --> 38:04.240]  and they're going to get individual people
[38:04.240 --> 38:07.240]  out of the Trump University a lot of money.
[38:07.240 --> 38:09.240]  Who knows how well they studied or followed their courses,
[38:09.240 --> 38:11.240]  but because they did not subsequently became rich,
[38:11.240 --> 38:13.240]  they found the lawsuit.
[38:13.240 --> 38:17.240]  And they are less than 10% of the entire student body
[38:17.240 --> 38:19.240]  of this organization.
[38:19.240 --> 38:21.240]  The other people were happy with their results.
[38:21.240 --> 38:23.240]  They went on to make money.
[38:23.240 --> 38:25.240]  Some people win, some people lose.
[38:25.240 --> 38:28.240]  It's based on the sweatier browing the decisions you make.
[38:28.240 --> 38:31.240]  There's one remaining count in the courts in New York
[38:31.240 --> 38:34.240]  where every technical research is impossible to be a cheat to win
[38:34.240 --> 38:37.240]  based on the previous decision throwing out all the other counts.
[38:37.240 --> 38:40.240]  Well, let's expand on this. Let's expand on this, though.
[38:40.240 --> 38:42.240]  So, the Koch brothers are all in.
[38:42.240 --> 38:44.240]  They're coming in against team.
[38:44.240 --> 38:46.240]  Now, let's get into the Supreme Court bombshell.
[38:46.240 --> 38:50.240]  And you also recognize, you've got, there's a whole,
[38:50.240 --> 38:53.240]  it tastes like it's likely to win Ohio.
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.240]  The Republican Party of Ohio is functioning like super PAC.
[38:56.240 --> 38:58.240]  The one thing these fellows do well
[38:58.240 --> 39:00.240]  is absentee ballots and early voting.
[39:00.240 --> 39:02.240]  They're masters at it.
[39:02.240 --> 39:08.240]  So, John Kasich, the modern Republican governor of Ohio,
[39:08.240 --> 39:11.240]  was going to go into the Ohio primary with a half million votes
[39:11.240 --> 39:13.240]  or more in the bank.
[39:13.240 --> 39:17.240]  Even if Trump wins on election day, that could do it.
[39:17.240 --> 39:19.240]  And then, you know, let's just say,
[39:19.240 --> 39:21.240]  hypothetically, the crew is split by Trump,
[39:21.240 --> 39:24.240]  although I was in Austin.
[39:24.240 --> 39:27.240]  And as I told you, Alex, I walked from the Capitol
[39:27.240 --> 39:29.240]  all the way down Second Street.
[39:29.240 --> 39:32.240]  I had a hat and glasses, but it looked as if it recognized.
[39:32.240 --> 39:34.240]  And the number of people who thanked me
[39:34.240 --> 39:36.240]  what I was doing for Donald Trump in my country
[39:36.240 --> 39:38.240]  and told me that they saw me without a joke,
[39:38.240 --> 39:41.240]  was mind blowing.
[39:41.240 --> 39:43.240]  So, the Patriots are out there.
[39:43.240 --> 39:45.240]  I'm seeing them every day. They're high-fiving.
[39:45.240 --> 39:47.240]  This is the revelation.
[39:47.240 --> 39:49.240]  Well, well, let's expand on that, because we're going to break
[39:49.240 --> 39:51.240]  and I know you're tired, but I have to hold you over,
[39:51.240 --> 39:53.240]  because I want to get to the other big issue
[39:53.240 --> 39:56.240]  that I want to raise, and that's this David Duke KKK stuff.
[39:56.240 --> 39:59.240]  That'd be like asking you, do you rape your wife often,
[39:59.240 --> 40:02.240]  or do you support Genghis Khan, or, you know,
[40:02.240 --> 40:04.240]  oh, hey, you know, a former Grand Dragon
[40:04.240 --> 40:07.240]  says he supports you on the borders.
[40:07.240 --> 40:09.240]  And so, you must be a Grand Dragon.
[40:09.240 --> 40:11.240]  Yeah, look, I remember something Ronald Reagan said
[40:11.240 --> 40:13.240]  when he was running for governor.
[40:13.240 --> 40:16.240]  He had many supporters in the John Bursche Society.
[40:16.240 --> 40:19.240]  The John Bursche Society does not endorse candidates.
[40:19.240 --> 40:22.240]  And the society itself has some odd views.
[40:22.240 --> 40:25.240]  As a conservative, I found them odd views.
[40:25.240 --> 40:27.240]  I thought the people who were members were good people.
[40:27.240 --> 40:29.240]  They were patriotic Americans.
[40:29.240 --> 40:32.240]  I just think maybe they'd gone a bit overboard.
[40:32.240 --> 40:34.240]  They would always ask Reagan, though,
[40:34.240 --> 40:36.240]  aren't you affiliated with the John Bursche Society?
[40:36.240 --> 40:38.240]  He would say, if somebody supports me,
[40:38.240 --> 40:40.240]  that means they support my agenda,
[40:40.240 --> 40:42.240]  not that I support their agenda.
[40:42.240 --> 40:44.240]  And I'm sure that's Trump's response,
[40:44.240 --> 40:46.240]  but they just ask him, who is this?
[40:46.240 --> 40:48.240]  And he's like, huh?
[40:48.240 --> 40:50.240]  Because it's just so weird to say,
[40:50.240 --> 40:52.240]  what do you think of Mao Zedong,
[40:52.240 --> 40:54.240]  or what do you think of, you know, Jimmy the Cricket?
[40:54.240 --> 40:56.240]  Well, yeah, see, he's not, but what they don't understand
[40:56.240 --> 40:58.240]  is he doesn't know that he doesn't,
[40:58.240 --> 41:00.240]  but there's two possibilities.
[41:00.240 --> 41:02.240]  Either he doesn't know who David Duke is,
[41:02.240 --> 41:05.240]  or he was confused by Duke's extensive plastic surgery,
[41:05.240 --> 41:07.240]  one of the two.
[41:07.240 --> 41:10.240]  I mean, he doesn't know this guy ran for governor and did well.
[41:10.240 --> 41:12.240]  He doesn't know that he's a hater and a bigot.
[41:12.240 --> 41:15.240]  You know, this is an attempt to smear Trump.
[41:15.240 --> 41:17.240]  Well, that's my issue, is these white supremacist groups,
[41:17.240 --> 41:19.240]  usually it turns out, are fed run.
[41:19.240 --> 41:21.240]  I don't know about Duke, but I know these people attack me
[41:21.240 --> 41:23.240]  all the time for no reason,
[41:23.240 --> 41:25.240]  because I don't hate blacks or Jews or whoever.
[41:25.240 --> 41:27.240]  And if they want Donald Trump to lose,
[41:27.240 --> 41:29.240]  they should just continue doing what they're doing.
[41:29.240 --> 41:31.240]  Which is what they do. I mean, how many of these things
[41:31.240 --> 41:33.240]  that turn out are fed run?
[41:33.240 --> 41:35.240]  Oh, that's exactly right, Alex. You put your finger on it.
[41:35.240 --> 41:37.240]  So this is an attempt to discredit Trump
[41:37.240 --> 41:39.240]  because they want to blunt the revolution.
[41:39.240 --> 41:41.240]  Well, here's the point.
[41:41.240 --> 41:43.240]  Trump has created thousands of jobs for black people.
[41:43.240 --> 41:45.240]  Brown people.
[41:45.240 --> 41:47.240]  Muslim.
[41:47.240 --> 41:49.240]  Trump is not a hater and he has no time for haters.
[41:49.240 --> 41:52.240]  He also has no time to be politically correct.
[41:52.240 --> 41:54.240]  He sees the country going down the toilet.
[41:54.240 --> 41:57.240]  And he sees the hands of Wall Street
[41:57.240 --> 41:59.240]  about to pull the flush lever.
[41:59.240 --> 42:01.240]  That's right. Repeat that because it actually didn't
[42:01.240 --> 42:03.240]  accidentally hit a button trying to punch up a screen
[42:03.240 --> 42:05.240]  and cut you off for a second.
[42:05.240 --> 42:07.240]  Repeat what you just said, Mr. Stone.
[42:07.240 --> 42:09.240]  I mean, really, here's the point where the American people,
[42:09.240 --> 42:11.240]  Donald Trump is tired of seeing the country
[42:11.240 --> 42:13.240]  going down the toilet.
[42:13.240 --> 42:16.240]  And the Wall Street and the Washington D.C. crowd
[42:16.240 --> 42:18.240]  with their hands on the flush lever.
[42:18.240 --> 42:20.240]  That's where we are.
[42:20.240 --> 42:23.240]  It's incredible how they have La Raza and Machia
[42:23.240 --> 42:25.240]  and all these Hispanic Klan groups running around
[42:25.240 --> 42:27.240]  saying for those inside our race, everything,
[42:27.240 --> 42:29.240]  for those outside the race, nothing.
[42:29.240 --> 42:32.240]  I mean, if I was Trump, I'd say I'm for everybody.
[42:32.240 --> 42:34.240]  I'm against Machia and La Raza.
[42:34.240 --> 42:36.240]  I have every confidence that the race goes down
[42:36.240 --> 42:37.240]  Trump will address this.
[42:37.240 --> 42:39.240]  Trump is not a bigot in any way.
[42:39.240 --> 42:41.240]  This is an attempt to make him look like one.
[42:41.240 --> 42:43.240]  Sure, but I'm the same way people ask me,
[42:43.240 --> 42:45.240]  are you racist against black people?
[42:45.240 --> 42:47.240]  I don't answer the question because it's putting you on the spot
[42:47.240 --> 42:49.240]  like they have the moral high ground.
[42:49.240 --> 42:51.240]  I assure you, Trump has been paying attention
[42:51.240 --> 42:52.240]  to building a billion dollars.
[42:52.240 --> 42:54.240]  He doesn't know this, sure, but it's great.
[42:54.240 --> 42:55.240]  We'll be right back.
[42:55.240 --> 42:58.240]  I want to get to the other final point straight ahead.
[42:58.240 --> 43:01.240]  It turns out Hillary Clinton and her top aides
[43:01.240 --> 43:04.240]  aren't the only ones with secret email aliases.
[43:04.240 --> 43:07.240]  Documents uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act
[43:07.240 --> 43:10.240]  reveal that former Attorney General Eric Holder
[43:10.240 --> 43:13.240]  used a false name for his official Justice Department
[43:13.240 --> 43:15.240]  email account.
[43:15.240 --> 43:17.240]  According to documents obtained by Vice News,
[43:17.240 --> 43:19.240]  all mentions of Lou Alcindor,
[43:19.240 --> 43:22.240]  the birth name of basketball player Karim Abdul-Jabbar,
[43:22.240 --> 43:25.240]  were actually referring to Holder himself.
[43:25.240 --> 43:27.240]  In response to the FOIA release,
[43:27.240 --> 43:29.240]  a Justice Department spokesman said the Holder's actions,
[43:29.240 --> 43:31.240]  they're not improper, legally questionable,
[43:31.240 --> 43:33.240]  or used to thwart FOIA requests,
[43:33.240 --> 43:36.240]  seeking information on the former Attorney General.
[43:36.240 --> 43:38.240]  Hmm, where have we heard that before?
[43:38.240 --> 43:42.240]  Experts in FOIA law say Holder's Lou Alcindor identity
[43:42.240 --> 43:45.240]  calls into question the ability of FOIA staff
[43:45.240 --> 43:49.240]  to locate all emails from an official who uses an alias.
