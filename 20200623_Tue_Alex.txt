[00:00.000 --> 00:12.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:12.860 --> 00:18.740]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:18.740 --> 00:25.260]  In multiple videos, we have seen Black Lives Matter strategically stop traffic of innocent
[00:25.260 --> 00:29.100]  locals just going about their business.
[00:29.100 --> 00:35.880]  We have seen drivers assaulted for asking to be allowed passage, and we have seen drivers
[00:35.880 --> 00:40.080]  ripped out of their car and beaten by an angry mob.
[00:40.080 --> 00:48.600]  Made possible with the support of mainstream media, this seems to be part of BLM's strategy.
[00:48.600 --> 00:55.120]  Stop traffic, attack innocent citizens in their cars, provoke a survival response, then
[00:55.120 --> 00:59.560]  accuse the driver of being a white nationalist.
[00:59.560 --> 01:07.560]  Beneath the recent NPR headline, Vehicle Attacks Rise as Extremists Target Protesters
[01:07.560 --> 01:10.600]  was an image of a car hitting a protester.
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.780]  But in a video from the same incident, we see an innocent driver who was stopped, harassed,
[01:16.780 --> 01:22.060]  and barely escaped being ripped out of their car before escaping and hitting a protester
[01:22.060 --> 01:24.200]  who was charging at them.
[01:24.200 --> 01:29.320]  After being called out for fake news, NPR offered no retraction.
[01:29.320 --> 01:34.640]  Instead, they wrote, the photo does not appear to be an example of the assaults described
[01:34.640 --> 01:40.760]  in the story and changed it to a three-year-old image from Charlottesville.
[01:40.760 --> 01:47.920]  NPR is not only telling dangerous lies, they are also telling its huge audience that if
[01:47.920 --> 01:53.280]  you don't submit to accepting a beating from the mob, then you will be accused of being
[01:53.280 --> 01:56.760]  an extremist and a racist.
[01:56.760 --> 02:00.600]  The leadership of Black Lives Matter is openly Marxist.
[02:00.600 --> 02:04.720]  We are trained Marxists.
[02:04.720 --> 02:11.720]  We are super versed on sort of ideological theories.
[02:11.720 --> 02:16.720]  They say that white people have to die for black communities to be made whole.
[02:16.720 --> 02:17.880]  Some white people may have to die.
[02:17.880 --> 02:20.400]  I'm confused on why that's so controversial.
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.480]  They admit that there is no plan other than destruction, and that the destruction is what
[02:26.480 --> 02:31.000]  will fuel the black minds to recreate a new world.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.880]  The full-on destruction of America is underway.
[02:35.880 --> 02:41.640]  Violent racial attacks against white people are being celebrated on social media as some
[02:41.640 --> 02:44.080]  sort of social justice.
[02:44.080 --> 02:51.160]  But any sane, reasonable mind understands that this only serves to frighten, divide,
[02:51.160 --> 02:54.280]  and enrage the people.
[02:54.280 --> 03:00.080]  History is being destroyed before our very eyes, and the movement is now calling for
[03:00.080 --> 03:07.160]  the destruction of Christian churches, and nothing is being done to stop any of it.
[03:07.160 --> 03:14.160]  It seems as if most Americans would rather surrender their freedom than be called a bad
[03:14.160 --> 03:15.160]  name.
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.880]  But a person who fears another man's judgment can never be free.
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.880]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[03:25.880 --> 03:30.040]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that
[03:30.040 --> 03:32.920]  is really, really an awful situation.
[03:32.920 --> 03:35.160]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[03:35.160 --> 03:47.760]  We love the American people.
[03:47.760 --> 03:49.960]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[03:49.960 --> 03:51.480]  We love the American people.
[03:51.480 --> 03:52.480]  We love the American people.
[03:52.480 --> 03:53.480]  We love the American people.
[03:53.480 --> 03:54.480]  They came in peace.
[03:54.480 --> 04:13.360]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[04:13.360 --> 04:22.360]  We love the American people.
[04:22.360 --> 04:29.360]  This is CNN.
[04:29.360 --> 04:38.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:38.360 --> 04:47.640]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[04:47.640 --> 04:54.640]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[04:54.640 --> 04:59.920]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[04:59.920 --> 05:05.480]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their
[05:05.480 --> 05:13.080]  world government believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[05:13.080 --> 05:21.400]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, if there's a mass awakening,
[05:21.400 --> 05:27.040]  it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[05:27.040 --> 05:31.320]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.320]  into it.
[05:32.320 --> 05:37.400]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will in this plan as a test.
[05:37.400 --> 05:42.080]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are
[05:42.080 --> 05:43.720]  going down the drain.
[05:43.720 --> 05:49.040]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[05:49.040 --> 05:54.600]  Everything hinges on you, everything peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always
[05:54.600 --> 05:55.600]  been.
[05:55.600 --> 06:21.600]  Bless and good luck.
[06:32.600 --> 06:34.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[06:34.600 --> 06:44.640]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this June 23, 2020, Tuesday Worldwide Broadcast.
[06:44.640 --> 06:49.560]  Well there is so much to cover and break down today and we're going to be going over all
[06:49.560 --> 06:51.320]  of it in great detail.
[06:51.320 --> 06:57.360]  Gavin McGinnis has now been banned off the last big tech platform that being YouTube
[06:57.360 --> 06:58.360]  for thought crime.
[06:58.360 --> 06:59.920]  He'll be joining us bottom of the hour.
[06:59.920 --> 07:05.240]  James O'Keefe joins us at the start of the hour with a huge Facebook inside whistleblower
[07:05.240 --> 07:10.280]  with super important intel on how they're involved in not just election meddling, but
[07:10.280 --> 07:14.160]  psychological warfare against the people of the planet Earth.
[07:14.160 --> 07:19.000]  And we have so many other again special guests that are going to be joining us today and
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.600]  Paul Joseph Watson is hosting the fourth hour.
[07:25.600 --> 07:31.120]  That said, I have some very important information I'm going to cover at the start of the next
[07:31.120 --> 07:39.240]  segment and that is the exemptions on wearing masks in major states like California and
[07:39.240 --> 07:40.240]  Texas.
[07:40.240 --> 07:47.640]  You have to ask yourself, why are these exemptions the same exemptions in multiple states?
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.800]  And that's because a central group is writing all this and preparing all of this and that
[07:52.800 --> 08:02.920]  group is called the WHO and the NIH and that itself exposes the entire situation.
[08:02.920 --> 08:07.240]  But this is about creating fear, about creating hysteria and about setting the precedent that
[08:07.240 --> 08:11.480]  when the government says you need to stay in your house or you need to stay six feet
[08:11.480 --> 08:16.560]  apart or you need to wear a mask, you do it ahead of the contact tracing apps that they're
[08:16.560 --> 08:18.000]  already rolling out.
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.360]  We told you about six months ago for total Internet of Things ID global social credit
[08:25.360 --> 08:26.360]  score.
[08:26.360 --> 08:27.360]  That's why this has got to be fought.
[08:27.360 --> 08:32.720]  It's not just oh, get over it, wear your mask, maybe statistically it will help somebody
[08:32.720 --> 08:35.960]  even though it's been proven to be a fraud and COVID-19 is a fraud and the numbers are
[08:35.960 --> 08:36.960]  hoax.
[08:36.960 --> 08:39.600]  They're actually killing people to get the money and say they had COVID.
[08:39.600 --> 08:42.600]  Despite all that, oh, just wear it and go along to get along.
[08:42.600 --> 08:49.680]  It's about accepting contact tracing and the total roll out of control and it is also,
[08:49.680 --> 08:53.760]  of course, about the forced inoculations that are coming.
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.400]  Bill Gates was universally rejected when he became our Lord and Savior who would decide
[08:59.400 --> 09:02.480]  our entire medical lives, our financial lives.
[09:02.480 --> 09:07.200]  He told us we're never opening again until we take his dangerous experimental vaccines
[09:07.200 --> 09:11.480]  that have been shut down in the trials because they're maiming and killing people has even
[09:11.480 --> 09:12.480]  come out.
[09:12.480 --> 09:16.680]  That's happening, but it's a minor footnote, so that's ultramassive news on the contact
[09:16.680 --> 09:17.680]  tracing.
[09:17.680 --> 09:24.960]  Even USA Today reports that Apple and Google are working with Bill and Bill Gates and the
[09:24.960 --> 09:33.200]  Clinton Global Initiative of their foundation and on the board is Chelsea Clinton.
[09:33.200 --> 09:34.280]  Isn't that just perfect?
[09:34.280 --> 09:40.360]  So this is all the technocracy, big tech merging with the NSA and other foreign government
[09:40.360 --> 09:47.520]  surveillance grids like China to totally control your life and the rollout is COVID-19.
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.960]  It is just the excuse and the hysteria and that's why we're making a big announcement
[09:52.960 --> 09:56.960]  later in the second hour today of a nationwide movement.
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.000]  The movement is going to be called We Can't Breathe.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.560]  The website is going to be WeCan'tBreathe.News.
[10:03.560 --> 10:09.280]  It'll be up this afternoon with a video report and a document article and an action plan
[10:09.280 --> 10:16.360]  and I will be out at the Texas Capitol this Sunday at high noon to protest the governor's
[10:16.360 --> 10:22.520]  capitulation to Gavin Newsom in the UN.
[10:22.520 --> 10:26.080]  Gavin Newsom orders masks last week.
[10:26.080 --> 10:30.080]  Other blue cities say they passed laws saying you have to wear them for a year at least.
[10:30.080 --> 10:35.560]  It'll probably never end until you take your shot and Governor Greg Abbott clicks his heels
[10:35.560 --> 10:40.760]  and says, how high, master to Newsom and comes out and says, okay, we have guidelines.
[10:40.760 --> 10:41.760]  You should all wear a mask.
[10:41.760 --> 10:44.280]  Tell you should wear a mask when you're in the swimming pool.
[10:44.280 --> 10:46.760]  You should wear a mask when you're in the grave.
[10:46.760 --> 10:48.880]  You should wear a mask when you're standing on your head.
[10:48.880 --> 10:53.760]  It's all completely made up, but there are waivers, loopholes that they don't want you
[10:53.760 --> 10:57.600]  to know about that we're going to show you the actual quote guidelines.
[10:57.600 --> 10:58.600]  These are not laws.
[10:58.600 --> 11:01.320]  These are edicts through peer pressure.
[11:01.320 --> 11:03.800]  They're trying to get you to take vaccines where there's no law to take them.
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.680]  They're trying to get you to accept contact tracing and control apps that track you when
[11:07.680 --> 11:08.680]  there's no law.
[11:08.680 --> 11:17.360]  They're trying to herd you in to this situation and people need to say no in a big, big, big
[11:17.360 --> 11:18.360]  way.
[11:18.360 --> 11:22.920]  So we're going to show you next segment the actual Texas regulation that is again just
[11:22.920 --> 11:29.040]  tyranny and what California has to say they're basically identical so that you have the tools
[11:29.040 --> 11:30.040]  to deal with that.
[11:30.040 --> 11:33.640]  Mainstream media though is trying to act like that is not the case.
[11:33.640 --> 11:41.240]  So that is coming up a separately Hollywood is collapsing a whole bunch of producers are
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.200]  dying and committing suicide as their pedophilia comes out.
[11:45.200 --> 11:49.360]  That is all coming up and that ties into these giant pedophile networks that are collapsing
[11:49.360 --> 11:52.760]  that are in big serious substantial trouble.
[11:52.760 --> 11:57.720]  It is the pedophile network they use to blackmail and control the population.
[11:57.720 --> 12:04.800]  Now yesterday when I started this show I told you 24 hours left on the tail end of the big
[12:04.800 --> 12:11.400]  mega sale and the items that are still 60 to 70% off that will end at 1pm today and

[14:56.120 --> 15:00.440]  edition a lot of these are one-offs some are great shirts some I design aren't that good
[15:00.440 --> 15:04.400]  it doesn't matter these are pieces of history they help spread the word the third dimension

[16:10.000 --> 16:15.760]  why a limited supply of solar backup generators will be available again in the next two weeks

[16:21.040 --> 16:27.160]  grid and unlike gas generators these solar generators run quietly emit no fumes and
[16:27.160 --> 16:33.040]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun dangerous weather social unrest

[20:21.360 --> 20:28.760]  mountaintop next to lucifer i'm not bowed to lucifer i'm not serving lucifer but i'm
[20:28.760 --> 20:35.880]  seeing the same vista and the same horizon as lucifer i am seeing it from the luciferian
[20:35.880 --> 20:40.880]  perspective and that's why they hate me is they don't want their own compartmentalized
[20:40.880 --> 20:48.520]  minions having the big high level field marshal view and those aren't words everyone knows
[20:48.520 --> 20:54.480]  it this is the field marshal view alex jones is facing an increasing number of platforms
[20:54.480 --> 20:59.640]  who will no longer publish his content a host of social media and tech companies have joined
[20:59.640 --> 21:05.800]  apple in banning far right conspiracy theorists alex jones and his info wars network from
[21:05.800 --> 21:10.560]  their platforms it's one of the biggest moves yet from facebook and its efforts to curb
[21:10.560 --> 21:15.680]  hate speech the bands target some of the most well-known far right personalities in the
[21:15.680 --> 21:22.680]  u.s. and the u.k. including alex jones founder of the conspiracy website info wars and x
[21:22.680 --> 21:28.200]  bright bar editor mylo yanopolis we've got a statement now with regard to pay pal and
[21:28.200 --> 21:33.600]  reports that it has ended its relationship with info wars in it their statement from
[21:33.600 --> 21:38.760]  a pay pal spokesperson said that we have undertaken an extensive review of the info war site and
[21:38.760 --> 21:43.040]  found instances that promoted hate or discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and
[21:43.040 --> 21:48.200]  religions which were encountered to our core values of inclusion for that reason they
[21:48.200 --> 21:53.960]  have ended their relationship people who follow alex jones and info wars say that this is
[21:53.960 --> 21:59.040]  a free speech issue whether or not how they impact people is not the point the point is
[21:59.040 --> 22:03.520]  that these are the largest social networks in the world their populations are larger
[22:03.520 --> 22:09.760]  than any country on earth and thus info wars and alex jones should be allowed to say what
[22:09.760 --> 22:15.960]  they say the people who are against them say no harassment is not okay these platforms
[22:15.960 --> 22:21.600]  have rules against this kind of behavior and they need to be enforced and after the violation
[22:21.600 --> 22:26.920]  from a post yesterday twitter decided that it was time for him to receive the most onerous
[22:26.920 --> 22:32.480]  punishment which is a permanent suspension that means none of his accounts can be reviewed
[22:32.480 --> 22:37.480]  globally that he's not allowed to make new accounts anymore and he is permanently kicked
[22:37.480 --> 22:44.400]  off the platform it wasn't for fake news that apple banned his podcasts on sunday a company
[22:44.400 --> 22:50.240]  spokesperson said it was for hate speech though they didn't cite a particular piece of content
[22:50.240 --> 22:56.360]  facebook spotify on youtube quickly followed on monday also citing hate speech it's just
[22:56.360 --> 23:01.480]  it's like anonymous so you don't know who's what who's good who's bad i just know i'm
[23:01.480 --> 23:08.200]  real i know you're real and i know that the southern district of new york and urman being
[23:08.200 --> 23:14.200]  fired and refusing to step down and then finally stepping down because it's the law is emblematic
[23:14.200 --> 23:20.120]  of everything we're facing and i knew before he refused to step down the president even
[23:20.120 --> 23:43.240]  fired imagine that that's the circle's info wars is in
[23:43.240 --> 23:48.560]  the world is going into an artificial financial collapse and the head of the united nations
[23:48.560 --> 23:53.720]  sustainable development organization said last week that that's a good thing and they're
[23:53.720 --> 23:59.800]  using covet to lower our standard of living to save the planet but it's a bunch of trillion
[23:59.800 --> 24:04.400]  dollar companies and billionaires who make themselves tax exempt and own slave factories
[24:04.400 --> 24:10.960]  in china like apple and nike that are then lecturing us that we should be poor and shouldn't
[24:10.960 --> 24:15.480]  be able to go on a trip or have a swimming pool or have a car or air conditioning remember
[24:15.480 --> 24:21.480]  when obama told africans in africa you can't have cars or air conditioning that's what
[24:21.480 --> 24:27.280]  this is about is making slavery cool and covet night team is the economic weapon that won't
[24:27.280 --> 24:32.240]  just make us poor it's going to kill hundreds of millions of people in the long term now
[24:32.240 --> 24:37.240]  i'm going to get into the new lockdown measures that we always knew were coming it's been pre-engineered
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.560]  in a moment but first let's just remember that it's on record that all these hospitals
[24:42.560 --> 24:47.840]  were completely empty and that the hospital ships trump said there was no patience for
[24:47.840 --> 24:53.600]  them and let's remember that it's now come out that for any patient they claimed had
[24:53.600 --> 25:00.000]  covet they got over fifty two thousand dollars and would put covet on charts when the person
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.160]  didn't even have covet and that they would count people who died of heart attacks and
[25:04.160 --> 25:10.760]  cancer and pneumonia or the flu as covet again to get the money it's been engineered all
[25:10.760 --> 25:17.360]  over the world because the w-h-o the u-n set the standards and the parameters and then
[25:17.360 --> 25:23.560]  when all those medical doctors came out prestigious scientist the head former virologist at rockefeller
[25:23.560 --> 25:30.200]  hospital came out and said this is a hoax this is a fraud they were banned off of youtube
[25:30.200 --> 25:36.680]  facebook and twitter because the system knows this hoax can't stand the light of day and
[25:36.680 --> 25:41.520]  the virus which is a real virus and a nasty pneumonia can't stand a lot of day that's
[25:41.520 --> 25:45.680]  why they're trying to keep you locked in these compact cities and that's why it's spread
[25:45.680 --> 25:50.960]  the most and killed the most people in blue cities and blue states that are these urban
[25:50.960 --> 25:56.000]  canyons where people don't get sunlight blue states blue cities are making similar announcements
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.880]  saying hey you got to wear masks for the next year you can never take your mask off this
[26:00.880 --> 26:07.880]  is all about creating fear and testing obedience and control over the population to wreck the
[26:07.880 --> 26:14.600]  economy and bring in a planetary government based on medical tyranny there's still time
[26:14.600 --> 26:19.400]  to stop this operation they've been planning this for decades the rockefeller foundation
[26:19.400 --> 26:24.120]  admits on record we bill them on the gates we have their battle plans and if the public
[26:24.120 --> 26:29.480]  simply speaks out and exposes it it will fail that's why they brought in total censorship
[26:29.480 --> 26:34.440]  ahead of this and during this to shut down debate but if we get the information to members
[26:34.440 --> 26:39.840]  of the senate and to good governors like governor habit and if you hit the streets and demonstrate
[26:39.840 --> 26:43.800]  and don't let the left intimidate you from exercising your first amendment we're going
[26:43.800 --> 26:48.280]  to win the globalists know that conservatives on average are very compliant and we believe
[26:48.280 --> 26:52.760]  it helps america and so they're telling us that we have to stay indoors or we're bad
[26:52.760 --> 26:57.600]  but the leftist and the anti-fun the black lives matter they're heroes when they go
[26:57.600 --> 27:03.600]  out and protest this is all a form of martial law to make the american people stand down
[27:03.600 --> 27:08.280]  ahead of this election with election fraud being prepared to artificially fraudulently
[27:08.280 --> 27:14.080]  remove president trump we can stop it if we simply do the research face the facts and
[27:14.080 --> 27:21.600]  take action and say no covid-19 is a hoax it's not killing anyone but old people that's
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.720]  why they sent people that had it to the old folks homes to get the numbers up instead
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.200]  of bowing down to the politicians that follow you in orders these governors that ordered
[27:31.200 --> 27:37.400]  people in the nursing homes to get the death numbers up should be indicted tried and imprisoned
[27:37.400 --> 27:42.800]  we're going the offense or we're totally enslaved it really is up to all of us now what we're
[27:42.800 --> 27:53.040]  going to do i don't want to know that i'm leaving you've been doing great oh and you're

[32:14.240 --> 32:24.680]  this by design that there's a mass awakening it can be their unraveling their destruction
[32:24.680 --> 32:28.920]  and then going down the drain the bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit
[32:28.920 --> 32:34.240]  for us they themselves fall into it but god is the master of the universe but gives us
[32:34.240 --> 32:39.000]  free will and this planet is a test it is up to us to decide whether we're going down
[32:39.000 --> 32:44.640]  the drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain i cannot express solicitors

[32:56.840 --> 33:24.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:24.120 --> 33:30.760]  to join a cult on a criminal organization you've always got to commit a crime they got to have
[33:30.760 --> 33:38.800]  something on you plus they want to know you're willing to really do things when you're told
[33:38.800 --> 33:48.560]  to do it ms-13 makes you torture a little boy a little girl to death for satan they
[33:48.560 --> 33:55.440]  didn't invent that they're just imitating the higher up criminal organizations and groups
[33:55.440 --> 34:04.640]  that are up there and now it's all coming out that the german government not just in
[34:04.640 --> 34:10.480]  berlin but all over western germany was placing young children with convicted pedophiles to
[34:10.480 --> 34:17.120]  have sex with them they believe to create the new family they said it's so loving when
[34:17.120 --> 34:23.640]  an adult has sex with a child of course all the numbers show it totally ruins their life
[34:23.640 --> 34:28.960]  destroys their innocence this is an inverted reality isn't it and now all these big hollywood
[34:28.960 --> 34:34.840]  producers are jumping to their deaths and dying and the whole system is collapsing so remember
[34:34.840 --> 34:40.720]  that while the globalists try to drag us down into the depths with them like we're the mighty
[34:40.720 --> 34:46.840]  sperm whale and they're a giant squid that everything you see is because their new world
[34:46.840 --> 34:53.120]  order is falling apart their global government their system is being rejected bill gates
[34:53.120 --> 34:58.000]  was running around foaming at the mouth just a month ago telling you how to live your life
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.480]  and he had a vaccine for you and you never leave your house and now he's the most hated
[35:01.480 --> 35:10.120]  man on earth and i can sit in a restaurant bar on the coast of texas or the coast of
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.160]  florida anywhere i go and people don't know who i am and they're all talking about bill
[35:15.160 --> 35:20.800]  gates in the new world order in the pedophiles everywhere i'm in the surf this week on the

[35:36.720 --> 35:44.080]  as gavin mcginnis or as donald trump or as yours truly because you have word of mouth
[35:44.080 --> 35:48.560]  and you can spread band on video and censored dot tv gavin mcginnis has now been banned
[35:48.560 --> 35:52.480]  off his last mainstream platform even though he even followed the rules and did really

[35:59.480 --> 36:03.320]  in a moment but first the big news i'm gonna get a stake on this donald trump comes out
[36:03.320 --> 36:08.320]  and i've said this if trump doesn't get super aggressive with 132 days left and if he doesn't
[36:08.320 --> 36:13.080]  stop listen to jared kushner and parscales and all the rest of them and if he doesn't
[36:13.080 --> 36:17.520]  go on the warpath and i mean really go after the deep state the tyrants all of them he's
[36:17.520 --> 36:24.240]  gonna lose well he's gone on the warpath ten years in prison attacking one of these statues
[36:24.240 --> 36:29.960]  on federal land he came out and accused obama which is true of treason still running the
[36:29.960 --> 36:35.040]  deep state government against it this is what we need to hear we need to hear the truth
[36:35.040 --> 36:40.160]  and trump's finger for the fences and the people will get behind him just like that this is
[36:40.160 --> 36:46.760]  what the president just had to say today on obama and the spine situation this this idea
[36:46.760 --> 36:51.840]  that they were spying on your campaign you've been asked before about what crime he would
[36:51.840 --> 36:56.080]  have potentially committed but i remember you talking to treason treason it's treason
[36:56.080 --> 37:02.040]  look when i came out a long time ago i said they've been spying on my campaign i said
[37:02.040 --> 37:06.000]  they've been taping and that was in quotes meaning a modern day version of taping it's
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.480]  all the same thing but a modern day version but they've been spying on my campaign i told
[37:10.480 --> 37:17.200]  you that a long time ago turned out i was right let's see what happens to him now durham
[37:17.200 --> 37:22.040]  is i never met durham because i want to stay out of it because otherwise it's going to
[37:22.040 --> 37:29.680]  look political but durham as you know is a highly respected person and bill bar is doing
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.360]  a great job as attorney general let's see what they come up with but they don't have
[37:35.360 --> 37:43.960]  to tell me all i have to do is read the papers the insurance policy in case she doesn't win
[37:43.960 --> 37:47.520]  we've got a insurance policy well that was all the stuff that we went through over the
[37:47.520 --> 37:52.040]  last let's say two and a half years now we caught him we caught him called struck and
[37:52.040 --> 37:59.480]  paged the two lovers uh brennan and clapper the way they lied democrats can't stand behind
[37:59.480 --> 38:04.280]  me they just they can't see in who bill bar they just think he's pulling you know why
[38:04.280 --> 38:11.320]  because he's doing such a good job because he's law and order but he's got them in his
[38:11.320 --> 38:17.560]  crosshairs and now we have to see what's going to happen i will say this if it were reversed
[38:17.560 --> 38:22.320]  and if the other side sat where at the oval office right in that chair behind the resolute
[38:22.320 --> 38:29.920]  desk and it was the opposite two years ago twenty five people would have been convicted
[38:29.920 --> 38:36.800]  and they would be sent to jail for fifty years and that's totally true instead big tech is
[38:36.800 --> 38:41.320]  now working with the clinton foundation with contact tracing to watch all our phones bring
[38:41.320 --> 38:46.080]  in a social credit score and now they admit they're banning trump on twitter with a shadow
[38:46.080 --> 38:50.000]  band gavin mcginnis another canary in the coal mine great to have you here when the
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.920]  only people as banned as i am quite an elite fraternity thank you for joining us my friend
[38:54.920 --> 39:00.280]  thanks for having me i was good to see you well you got banned on youtube let's get into
[39:00.280 --> 39:03.800]  that and let's get into the state of affairs and trump and where you see this all going
[39:03.800 --> 39:10.400]  and how folks can still find you uncensored unfiltered at censored dot tv yep it's the
[39:10.400 --> 39:14.640]  last bastion the pirate ship i mean i got the idea from you if you make your own thing
[39:14.640 --> 39:19.480]  they can't ban you but i was still on youtube it was almost an experiment i was following
[39:19.480 --> 39:26.720]  the rules but they they got paranoid that via the proud boys we were going to go into chaz
[39:26.720 --> 39:33.720]  so just to be clear here there's antifa and blm raping and murdering people not just in
[39:33.720 --> 39:40.360]  chaz but all over the country but the second someone implies they might go and offend those
[39:40.360 --> 39:46.200]  people shut down burn the library burn the books get them out of here they are more
[39:46.200 --> 39:51.080]  scared of a perceived threat than the actual threat that's right in front of their nose
[39:51.080 --> 39:57.280]  well they've got to guard their little delicate geniuses that have literally there's like
[39:57.280 --> 40:03.040]  seven people that indicted the last week for shooting people in the head at blm antifa
[40:03.040 --> 40:06.320]  where they just blocked the road and just if you don't stop now they just shoot you in
[40:06.320 --> 40:14.160]  the head and the media is covering it up you've got a bunch of black people promoting marxism
[40:14.160 --> 40:19.680]  how the hell did they pull that off they get to marxist lesbians give them a bunch of money
[40:19.680 --> 40:24.800]  and the next thing you know they represent racial equality when they clearly state on
[40:24.800 --> 40:31.400]  their homepage that they're here to destroy the nuclear family that's right black lives
[40:31.400 --> 40:38.840]  matters basically a george soros funded arm of plant parenthood and we've got all these
[40:38.840 --> 40:43.600]  videos of black people walking up and shooting white people in the head but it's not making
[40:43.600 --> 40:47.520]  national news again the average black person isn't to blame for this when a white racist
[40:47.520 --> 40:51.760]  kills a black person it's not all white people's fault either but this we have all these videos
[40:51.760 --> 40:57.040]  of white people at driving their truck through a checkpoint of antifa and they shoot the guy
[40:57.040 --> 41:00.880]  in the head and the guy that shot him in the head is proud he said well he's white and
[41:00.880 --> 41:06.760]  the dude that shot him is white this is insanity and if you call it out then you're offending
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.680]  the globalist marxist and you have to be stopped it's just incredible that they can sell this
[41:12.680 --> 41:18.360]  mayhem when all this is happening i felt like saying see i told you so alex and i were warning
[41:18.360 --> 41:24.680]  you people about this for years and now it's happened we're in a civil war and now even
[41:24.680 --> 41:29.800]  in the civil war they go well you stop talking about that it's not true it's proud boys it's
[41:29.800 --> 41:34.320]  republicans it's trump's that's right CNN called for a quote violent revolution yesterday
[41:34.320 --> 41:40.640]  in an uprising in a headline but when we pointed out oh we're bad okay well we're not going
[41:40.640 --> 41:45.720]  to stop pointing it out because that's our job here we're gonna ask you this i remember
[41:45.720 --> 41:48.520]  when you were on a couple years ago we were both ban on a bunch of platforms you said listen
[41:48.520 --> 41:52.600]  i'm not worried about me everybody's next and now it's happened to everybody i mean
[41:52.600 --> 41:58.760]  it's just crazy it's like any war hall is 15 minutes of fame but now it's 15 minutes
[41:58.760 --> 42:04.040]  of cancelled and everyone is going to go through it jimmy kimmel's racist jimmy fallon is racist
[42:04.040 --> 42:09.520]  joe rogan's racist all the people that were calling for this this racist cancelling are
[42:09.520 --> 42:14.080]  now accused of it you got what you asked for you know have you noticed by the way they're
[42:14.080 --> 42:20.320]  they're always the ones pushing for punishment for a crime they're doing like obama said
[42:20.320 --> 42:25.800]  hey trump is election meddling he's working with putin and at the exact same time obama
[42:25.800 --> 42:30.920]  was election meddling by spying on trump well exactly but i mean take i never dressed up
[42:30.920 --> 42:36.600]  in blackface because i mean if i just think it's too it's it's offensive i mean and people
[42:36.600 --> 42:40.240]  have a right to do it i just never did it you you never did it but everybody that did
[42:40.240 --> 42:44.880]  blackface then says you should be banned for making a joke or something we'll be right

[47:50.920 --> 47:56.720]  didn't censor himself and didn't back down despite them trying to bankrupt him delisting
[47:56.720 --> 48:00.240]  put him in prison putting some of his supporters in prison lying about it because they're so
[48:00.240 --> 48:04.320]  scared of his wit and his humor so at the time we have left this 10 minutes you've got
[48:04.320 --> 48:09.720]  the floor i got a thousand questions 100 points to make but what is most important for you
[48:09.720 --> 48:15.160]  to telegraph to this audience today now that you've been kicked off the final uh node of
[48:15.160 --> 48:18.440]  the internet i think it's probably going to be everybody's next i mean this is the global
[48:18.440 --> 48:24.320]  social credit score isn't it it certainly is and uh you know you used to always ask me
[48:24.320 --> 48:29.400]  when i'd come on the show where does this end what happens what what what is what is
[48:29.400 --> 48:37.880]  peak sjw yes and we're in it now we're in a civil war we're in a revolution right now
[48:37.880 --> 48:44.240]  there's two americas and they are irreconcilable because one of them wants to destroy america
[48:44.240 --> 48:49.520]  what do they say no borders no wall no usa at all i was banned from youtube for making
[48:49.520 --> 48:55.640]  a subtle threat uh against antifa and blm and these terrorists saying on my birthday
[48:55.640 --> 49:00.640]  july 18th we're going to take this country back that was like no no no no don't interrupt
[49:00.640 --> 49:07.440]  them don't offend them why why does the media and big tech the dnc why do so many people
[49:07.440 --> 49:12.640]  cnn why are they so worried about the feelings of people who are trying to burn our country
[49:12.640 --> 49:17.960]  to the ground i'll tell you why because they too want to burn this country to the ground
[49:17.960 --> 49:23.080]  and we can't let them do that you know we've been watching you for over 10 years you always
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.880]  said because you're a real liberal not a leftist is that when you figured out that the left
[49:26.880 --> 49:31.600]  literally hated america and wanted to pull it down and tear it down and burn it down
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.440]  you had to turn against them yeah i know there's someone else couple will hear that rarely
[49:36.440 --> 49:42.840]  gets criticized and it's the k through 12 union teachers who have been brainwashing
[49:42.840 --> 49:48.040]  our youth into believing that america sucks like they don't know what these statues are
[49:48.040 --> 49:53.920]  it just represents history and america and hard work and they're just like that screw
[49:53.920 --> 49:58.240]  that rippling roosevelt totally worked to empower black people that's why he's in a
[49:58.240 --> 50:03.360]  statue with a black person and and and and titty rosevelt got shot during a speech
[50:03.360 --> 50:08.960]  and finish the speech over an hour long shot in the chest i mean the now they're pulling
[50:08.960 --> 50:16.800]  down abolitionist statues it's don't try to insert logic into it those statues just represent
[50:16.800 --> 50:21.760]  america and these kids have been taught their whole lives that america is evil and has to
[50:21.760 --> 50:27.040]  be rebuilt from scratch america was built from scratch we tried all of these bad roots
[50:27.040 --> 50:32.880]  we we treated the indians wrong we did have slaves we fought to write those wrongs and
[50:32.880 --> 50:38.840]  we all ended up here to trial and error to the freest country in the world where no nowhere
[50:38.840 --> 50:44.360]  are blacks and gays and and minorities treated better than in america it's a it's an experiment
[50:44.360 --> 50:48.680]  that has gone perfectly it was a very rocky road to get here and now they're using our
[50:48.680 --> 50:55.360]  strength against us pardon me and now they're using our strength against us exactly they're
[50:55.360 --> 51:01.200]  using our obsession with not hurting people against us well and that's not working okay
[51:01.200 --> 51:05.320]  being gentle isn't working i think these people have showed their true colors and it's time
[51:05.320 --> 51:11.440]  to to drag the country back to freedom do you think trump was right to wait a month
[51:11.440 --> 51:15.760]  because now chaz and chop is being shut down because they're killing people every night
[51:15.760 --> 51:20.640]  they're it's it's descended into road warrior for real and now even the mayor that praised
[51:20.640 --> 51:27.080]  it as the summer of love is he's trying to shut chop down right now no just be clear
[51:27.080 --> 51:34.360]  i shot chop down they she moved in immediately after proud boys got permits we're trying
[51:34.360 --> 51:40.200]  to get permits to demonstrate within chop the second we did that she went nuts and said
[51:40.200 --> 51:46.680]  it's gotta shut i saw that why are they so scared of you because i'm charming and because
[51:46.680 --> 51:51.560]  we're patriotic and they see the proud boys of patriotic men's club it's multiracial with
[51:51.560 --> 51:56.800]  Jewish people and gays that all love america and they go this is not good i can't i i have
[51:56.800 --> 52:04.280]  to paint them as nazis i have to stop them because i need control the left really is
[52:04.280 --> 52:09.280]  pathetic but i see their attempt to collapse the country as them trying to take us down
[52:09.280 --> 52:12.120]  with them and i mean do you think that's an accurate statement that they were really
[52:12.120 --> 52:17.920]  seeing the collapse of the left worldwide yes they don't have a life like what do they
[52:17.920 --> 52:23.360]  do they're gremlins their legacy will be that they destroyed a bunch of other people's
[52:23.360 --> 52:28.080]  lives they went to college and they came out stupider than when they went in and these
[52:28.080 --> 52:33.280]  people are going to leave the earth worse off i mean it's one thing to not have a legacy
[52:33.280 --> 52:38.160]  and they're just plotted away and you know not stood up for yourself and then died that's
[52:38.160 --> 52:44.600]  that's just a zero these people are below zero they're sabotaging lives sabotaging the country
[52:44.600 --> 52:53.280]  imagine that imagine you leave the place worse off than when you arrived it's pathetic
[52:53.280 --> 52:58.880]  what about npr being caught with full videos of people attacking cars with guns trying
[52:58.880 --> 53:02.840]  to and then the car panics and drives off survival instinct and the news says a white
[53:02.840 --> 53:09.200]  supremacist attacks that turns out it was hispanic lady and and and npr doesn't apologize
[53:09.200 --> 53:14.120]  they double down isn't it strange seeing all these people together at these rallies they
[53:14.120 --> 53:21.840]  have nothing in common from like street thugs to fat npr women to bratty spoiled sons of
[53:21.840 --> 53:26.360]  academics these people couldn't if they sat at the dinner table they wouldn't know what
[53:26.360 --> 53:32.480]  to say to each other yet because they all hate america equally they're united in this
[53:32.480 --> 53:38.240]  bonfire to burn it all down well that's it you've got these you know the google twins
[53:38.240 --> 53:45.040]  that started it serjay brev and and page and they're together worth like a hundred fifty
[53:45.040 --> 53:49.480]  million dollars and they literally believe they're the underdog and america sucks even
[53:49.480 --> 53:54.280]  though america protected them and built them up it just doesn't make any sense at the left
[53:54.280 --> 54:00.400]  runs things but then abuses everyone in the name that they're these underdogs you want
[54:00.400 --> 54:06.240]  to be an underdog try being a trump supporter in new york city you are they keep saying
[54:06.240 --> 54:10.520]  that we endorse violence we are surrounded by violence when we sit down at the dinner
[54:10.520 --> 54:14.360]  table when we go to a restaurant our back is against the wall when i go to a restaurant
[54:14.360 --> 54:18.800]  i'm ready to eat people's spit i do it all i love it i just accept it i know they're
[54:18.800 --> 54:25.600]  wiping the steak from their ass i love it i just like enjoy the flavor i'm at the point
[54:25.600 --> 54:34.920]  now where if a wages doesn't spit in my food it tastes dry exactly exactly i'll send it
[54:34.920 --> 54:39.560]  back if there's no spit in it now i've become used to it you know i learned a story from
[54:39.560 --> 54:42.840]  sean hannity i'm not supposed to tell him but i'm gonna tell her right now they caught
[54:42.840 --> 54:49.000]  the guy spitting on his steak the chef at a new york takeouts because he put it out
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.720]  on twitter and he didn't he didn't go he didn't put it out he just went i want that guy fired
[54:53.720 --> 55:00.320]  they fired it well guess what sean i'm gonna tell the story imagine sean is so nice he
[55:00.320 --> 55:08.800]  only wanted the guy fired when the dude literally put it out of what he done unbelievable listen
[55:08.800 --> 55:12.600]  if somebody came into my restaurant that i hated i go tell them their face get out or
[55:12.600 --> 55:17.520]  i'd get in their face i wouldn't wipe my ass with their steak again it's all this sneakiness
[55:17.520 --> 55:22.320]  you're right it's gremlin behavior isn't it that's what i was saying before like they
[55:22.320 --> 55:27.720]  accuse us of what they do they say we want genocide we want to kill trannies when they
[55:27.720 --> 55:31.880]  that's exactly what they will do when they get empowered they're Stalinists they massacre
[55:31.880 --> 55:36.120]  us like bolsheviks and the reason that you and i are a problem is because we noticed
[55:36.120 --> 55:41.000]  this trick and we're we have the potential to mobilize that's the real fear right there
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.560]  like and colter for example she was a bunch of proud boys were guarding her when she was
[55:46.560 --> 55:52.320]  doing a talk in florida the waitress doxed her location and tifa showed up they saw
[55:52.320 --> 55:56.640]  a bunch of proud boys at the table with her and they ran away that's why they hate us
[55:56.640 --> 56:03.120]  because we get in the way of them attacking and colter attacking sean hanity attacking
[56:03.120 --> 56:07.240]  you and i if you stand up for yourself as we learned with the covington catholic school
[56:07.240 --> 56:12.320]  kids you are being violent if you get in the way of their violence you're being violent
[56:12.320 --> 56:18.560]  and i love how they parade around with kkk outfits saying that's trump that's the democrats
[56:18.560 --> 56:26.120]  yeah when do you last see a bona fide kkk person not stock footage actually walking
[56:26.120 --> 56:33.520]  down a street we hear about them every day it's a lie it's a marxist lie and i think
[56:33.520 --> 56:38.360]  the average american has woken up to that and this whole this whole debacle is going
[56:38.360 --> 56:44.440]  to mean a landslide victory for trump well the truth is the left wants to own men getting
[56:44.440 --> 56:47.720]  together and doing anything political when we're like you said you're not even right
[56:47.720 --> 56:52.000]  wing i'm not right wing i'm just pro human and they're just scared of men organizing
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.880]  against tyranny because they know it's men that challenge tyranny throughout history
[56:56.880 --> 57:01.480]  most of this is just daddy issues that's why they say smash the patriarchy because they
[57:01.480 --> 57:05.440]  feel embarrassed to their inadequacies and they see it in their dad's eyes they see the
[57:05.440 --> 57:10.440]  disappointment so they hate men and they hate men's clubs and they hate trump because he
[57:10.440 --> 57:15.040]  seems patriarchal anything fatherly is the devil to them because they know they've been
[57:15.040 --> 57:20.000]  bad all right well in five more minutes gab mcganis band on youtube let's talk about

[58:50.280 --> 58:57.240]  awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries
[58:57.240 --> 59:01.920]  that's why the new world order is instituting race war and division and telling the people
[59:01.920 --> 59:07.280]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[59:07.280 --> 59:13.920]  essential services this is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists as
[59:13.920 --> 59:18.320]  they've done in the third world will come in and pick up the pieces you must stand against
[59:18.320 --> 59:24.400]  the u n the i m f the world bank and the u openly saying the fund the police the police

[59:28.080 --> 59:32.680]  local tabulary and believe me once the globalists have overthrown this country they are going
[59:32.680 --> 59:37.140]  to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom the globalists believe
[59:37.140 --> 59:42.240]  communist china is the model of the world and they are orchestrating this entire thing
[59:42.240 --> 59:47.520]  the people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed info wars
[59:47.520 --> 1:00:15.060]  dot com you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:00:35.220 --> 1:00:41.500]  but going back to gabin again as captain thanks for coming on short notice i know that you'd
[1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:46.620]  really been playing by their rules as you said you told me this offer months ago i'm
[1:00:46.620 --> 1:00:52.140]  doing this as a test i'm totally following their out of control rules but it doesn't
[1:00:52.140 --> 1:00:56.020]  matter an organization you found that you're not even a part of it anymore they feared
[1:00:56.020 --> 1:01:01.100]  that so much that you had to be whacked on the head just as a sign of any resistance
[1:01:01.100 --> 1:01:08.700]  to our antifa army will be met with total censorship can you imagine if we applied any
[1:01:08.700 --> 1:01:17.900]  of their rules to their behavior can you imagine if a group of mega men took over there was
[1:01:17.900 --> 1:01:21.340]  murder there there was a break there we just got news right now that they're handing out
[1:01:21.340 --> 1:01:27.460]  guns to people there are full on insurrection can you imagine if trump was spying on someone
[1:01:27.460 --> 1:01:32.940]  else's campaign on his competition's campaign can you imagine if by the way back that up
[1:01:32.940 --> 1:01:38.260]  i just got that 10 minutes ago to at chop the autonomous zone they're handing out guns
[1:01:38.260 --> 1:01:44.500]  to resist the mayor now that she says the experiment's over i mean if we did this they'd send
[1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:52.300]  in they'd send in the army rangers day one i am canceled from youtube for daring to offend
[1:01:52.300 --> 1:01:56.540]  these people if the rules were reversed that the rules were reversed and right was left
[1:01:56.540 --> 1:02:02.500]  and left was right they'd be apoplectic and they'd be right they'd be right to be freaking
[1:02:02.500 --> 1:02:08.860]  out this is an insurrection and if our crimes it's like we're responsible for 150 percent
[1:02:08.860 --> 1:02:13.660]  of the things we do wrong and they're responsible for about 20 percent of the things they do
[1:02:13.660 --> 1:02:20.260]  wrong it's it's a radical injustice let me ask you this i was asking this what is peak
[1:02:20.260 --> 1:02:23.500]  crazy i think we're starting to see it but what do you think they're going to do now
[1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:27.060]  because they've they've got the covet hugs and now the race war hugs and you know they're
[1:02:27.060 --> 1:02:32.980]  not going to stop on the 130 days out i think they're going to try because the cases of
[1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:41.100]  kovat which is a bad flu that probably killed more like 60 000 so not our worst flu season
[1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:46.100]  but a fairly bad one they're going those are going to go up again to normal rates as they
[1:02:46.100 --> 1:02:50.980]  do in the fall and so they're going to try to push for a lockdown if america falls for
[1:02:50.980 --> 1:02:56.180]  that again i don't know what i'm going to do like they've been disproven in new york
[1:02:56.180 --> 1:03:03.540]  city we had a rally for trans black trans there was 200 000 people shoulder to shoulder
[1:03:03.540 --> 1:03:10.300]  barely any masks now that that's not uh atypical of these riots these meetings these protests
[1:03:10.300 --> 1:03:15.260]  where's the spike it takes two weeks to show symptoms and they've been writing for three
[1:03:15.260 --> 1:03:20.660]  and a half four weeks where's the spike it's been disproven yet you still see masks all
[1:03:20.660 --> 1:03:25.740]  over new york city people driving with masks on are you that gullible so they might fall
[1:03:25.740 --> 1:03:30.980]  for it again and they'll push for a mail in and if they get a mail in the dems will stand
[1:03:30.980 --> 1:03:36.660]  a pretty good chance of winning because they are the masters of voter fraud i saw a newsweek
[1:03:36.660 --> 1:03:43.300]  headline biggest spike in tulsa ever it takes 14 days with incubation people ran out hysterically
[1:03:43.300 --> 1:03:47.780]  got tested most of them are false positives and then they have oh trump caused the biggest
[1:03:47.780 --> 1:03:52.940]  spike ever hoax after hoax but oh again like you said when the left protests with hundreds
[1:03:52.940 --> 1:03:58.900]  of thousands that's wonderful and beautiful but when 6000 show for trump it's bad as journalism
[1:03:58.900 --> 1:04:05.820]  ever been worse have we ever had lower quality i was talking to a dnc a dem the other day
[1:04:05.820 --> 1:04:09.700]  about joe biden i said i understand that you hate trump that that's i i get i get where

[1:07:52.340 --> 1:07:58.180]  my pleasure it's an honor thank you i'm here because well i'm here for a very specific
[1:07:58.180 --> 1:08:04.220]  reason and that is to fight internet tech censorship internet censorship and as he said i'm a
[1:08:04.220 --> 1:08:09.140]  thousand percent committed and willing to testify in front of congress for all the things
[1:08:09.140 --> 1:08:15.260]  that i've seen and yeah i mean this is this is the biggest issue that we're facing in
[1:08:15.260 --> 1:08:19.460]  the lead up to the one of the biggest issues are really seeing in the lead up to the election
[1:08:19.460 --> 1:08:24.180]  and i think the public's ability to communicate and big tech surveilling us there everybody
[1:08:24.180 --> 1:08:28.860]  focuses on the censorship that's not my issue is the surveillance of what we're doing in
[1:08:28.860 --> 1:08:35.500]  live time if the nsa did this they'd all be frog marched into guantanamo bay absolutely
[1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:40.220]  absolutely well please continue yeah oh yeah of course you know we've seen mark zuckerberg
[1:08:40.220 --> 1:08:45.020]  say time and time again that they don't have any bias that's uh facebook and he's testified
[1:08:45.020 --> 1:08:50.420]  as well he's uh you know he's he's given testimony uh saying that there's no bias but clearly
[1:08:50.420 --> 1:08:56.980]  we're showing that there is it's simply not true and there have been there there are two
[1:08:56.980 --> 1:09:01.780]  big there are two big facets to this whole situation you know there's the policy side
[1:09:01.780 --> 1:09:05.220]  where they make these exceptions for their policies and they have these policies that
[1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:09.620]  outright target conservatives they have you know people like laura lumar milo everybody
[1:09:09.620 --> 1:09:16.540]  banned and then they have the moderators themselves like i was a lot of them are almost all they're
[1:09:16.540 --> 1:09:21.140]  almost all leftists they're almost all liberals and they will well they're willing to go rogue
[1:09:21.140 --> 1:09:25.500]  and delete anything that they don't like and willing to delete any conservatives that they
[1:09:25.500 --> 1:09:29.300]  see well you're a major whistleblower let's just just you people the proud approximation
[1:09:29.300 --> 1:09:33.660]  what did you witness how long were you at facebook and what made you go public yeah so i was
[1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:40.180]  with facebook from january last year till the end of february this year and i witnessed
[1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:46.100]  for the first leg of it i witnessed mostly policy issues you know i witnessed like uh
[1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:49.980]  the exceptions that they made that were targeting conservatives but later on i noticed a lot
[1:09:49.980 --> 1:09:57.660]  of people that i was working with were they were willing to exercise their uh their i
[1:09:57.660 --> 1:10:03.660]  guess freedom to uh delete anything that they wanted with almost impunity because there
[1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:07.380]  are a lot of people who never really saw any recourse for the times that they decided
[1:10:07.380 --> 1:10:11.820]  to delete things that they you know and watching the video that's a project very tossed me
[1:10:11.820 --> 1:10:18.380]  have one in fours dot com there's a vitriol a pleasure just it is ruling over people
[1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:23.380]  while zuckerberg tells congress it's not happening to their face absolutely i spoke to one person
[1:10:23.380 --> 1:10:28.620]  who i said you know uh i well i spoke about just taking down all of the trump posts that
[1:10:28.620 --> 1:10:33.900]  you see and they said oh i thought i was the only one i thought i i thought i thought i
[1:10:33.900 --> 1:10:38.700]  or i mean i yeah they basically said that they had been doing it the whole time and
[1:10:38.700 --> 1:10:46.980]  uh yeah there's vitriol the person said that it was revenge against the maggot people wow
[1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:51.860]  so what made you finally decided to shoot undercover video because i love alveritas i'm
[1:10:51.860 --> 1:10:55.940]  sure didn't direct you most of the time it's like people just spontaneously want to show
[1:10:55.940 --> 1:11:01.500]  this evil and then they show it precisely well yeah from right from the get go when
[1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:05.380]  i was in training i saw all this terrible stuff and i thought uh when i was in training
[1:11:05.380 --> 1:11:08.660]  for the cognizant uh they were telling me about the policy and they were telling me
[1:11:08.660 --> 1:11:12.100]  about all that stuff and i thought you know this is terrible i got to do something about
[1:11:12.100 --> 1:11:14.740]  this i got to say something but where am i going to go am i going to leak this stuff
[1:11:14.740 --> 1:11:21.240]  online get sued for nothing and nobody cares no there's no really there's no other place
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:27.620]  aside from project veritas that does this kind of stuff and later that year i reached
[1:11:27.620 --> 1:11:32.820]  out it kind of clicked with me finally because i've been a fan of pv for some years but finally
[1:11:32.820 --> 1:11:35.860]  clicked with me later that year that maybe they'd be interested and sure enough they
[1:11:35.860 --> 1:11:39.980]  were within a few weeks we were rolling well that's really their great work it's not just
[1:11:39.980 --> 1:11:44.380]  their courage but the fact that they can actually absorb so many reports go through them verify
[1:11:44.380 --> 1:11:48.140]  them and get them out and look i don't mean this to be politically correct but it was
[1:11:48.140 --> 1:11:53.580]  a policy to put Native Americans in reservations and let them die it was a policy that black
[1:11:53.580 --> 1:11:58.620]  people didn't have full rights it was a policy of Hitler for the final solution so you watch
[1:11:58.620 --> 1:12:03.580]  google and apple and facebook and twitter go oh it's a policy that we ban and restrict
[1:12:03.580 --> 1:12:07.340]  conservatives and then they lie to congress about it so they call it a policy but it's
[1:12:07.340 --> 1:12:14.140]  it's far from a policy what it is is an ideological bullying and a dominance and election meddling
[1:12:14.140 --> 1:12:18.460]  it's absolutely ideologically influenced and you know you talk about policies i think the
[1:12:18.460 --> 1:12:21.500]  most dangerous thing that one of the most dangerous things that they've been doing and
[1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:26.460]  this is something that was covered very famously last year they had the clause in their violence
[1:12:26.460 --> 1:12:31.260]  policy that allowed for calls for violence to be made against people like paul joseph
[1:12:31.260 --> 1:12:35.980]  lotson and mylo and laura loomer and all these people who are on their list their dangerous
[1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:40.060]  individuals list by the way you forget about that and i want to add i'm very proud of it
[1:12:40.060 --> 1:12:44.860]  i was that list too they said these are individuals that you're allowed to be violent against
[1:12:44.860 --> 1:12:48.860]  and then they removed that what do you know the process of who put it on there
[1:12:48.860 --> 1:12:52.940]  and who removed because this was pushed out to all the moderators can you talk about the
[1:12:52.940 --> 1:12:57.580]  the nuts and bolts of that well alex i'm going to tell you right now you'll probably be surprised
[1:12:57.580 --> 1:13:03.340]  it was never removed publicly they reported that that was removed but that was never the case
[1:13:03.340 --> 1:13:08.540]  they simply removed it from public policy actually it was still in the private policy
[1:13:08.540 --> 1:13:12.700]  that was given to the moderators that they used to moderate the content so
[1:13:12.700 --> 1:13:17.260]  they actually let me stop you this is beyond bombshell and tell people the articles we'll
[1:13:17.260 --> 1:13:21.820]  pull them up on screen because this is this is a prescript we're live everybody remembers a year
[1:13:21.820 --> 1:13:28.300]  ago whatever it was watson learned i learned that that it said if it's violence directed
[1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:33.180]  at right wing hate figures you're allowed to do it and so they dehumanize this like hitler did the
[1:13:33.180 --> 1:13:37.580]  jews and then they said you're now allowed to go after them and then when they got caught they
[1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:42.060]  removed it but you're saying that was only in the public policy the real directive stayed in place
[1:13:42.060 --> 1:13:48.620]  wow so that is a member zuckerberg said last year you can only say alex jones's name if it's negative
[1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:53.980]  but it went beyond that they were saying defend organized violence my god that's criminal mafia
[1:13:53.980 --> 1:13:59.980]  racketeering absolutely it's it's it's it's illegal these people these people are responsible for
[1:13:59.980 --> 1:14:03.820]  this should be in jail i'm gonna stop interrupting start over you just got me blown away right now
[1:14:03.820 --> 1:14:08.380]  major facebook whistleblower right now walk through that particular story because this is a
[1:14:08.380 --> 1:14:15.420]  a keyhole in the whole thing thank you i believe so too so very famously they had a clause in their
[1:14:15.420 --> 1:14:21.420]  policy the violence policy that allowed for calls for violence against people who are on the
[1:14:21.420 --> 1:14:26.380]  dangerous individuals and organizations list so what does that mean well they allow for calls
[1:14:26.380 --> 1:14:31.740]  for high severity violence which is anything that could kill somebody or severely harm them
[1:14:31.740 --> 1:14:37.180]  and people like algers and watson yourself lower lower-loom and mildly not plus a lot of people
[1:14:37.180 --> 1:14:45.580]  are on that list um or were at least implicated in that and they received a large public backlash
[1:14:45.580 --> 1:14:50.460]  for that you know obviously you why would anybody be allowed to have like basically death threats
[1:14:50.460 --> 1:14:57.820]  sent against them and so they quietly removed that portion of the policy and i think probably the
[1:14:57.820 --> 1:15:02.300]  reason they didn't announce it because they didn't announce that they rescinded it and it was updates
[1:15:02.300 --> 1:15:06.940]  to the stories that broke it that said that it was removed probably the reason they didn't announce
[1:15:06.940 --> 1:15:11.740]  it is because they knew and everybody on the content moderation side knew there wasn't actually
[1:15:11.740 --> 1:15:17.020]  removed it was still there well my entire time that i was there and it was still there when i left
[1:15:17.020 --> 1:15:22.860]  in late february and it may still be there it may still be that people can make calls for violence
[1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:31.580]  and perhaps death threats to people like yourself and other uh other other folks i am blown away
[1:15:31.580 --> 1:15:36.300]  right now jack mackleroy's our guest we have james will keep coming up with him as well but i want
[1:15:36.300 --> 1:15:42.140]  to learn more as a major whistleblower about what else happened but just when he just dropped on us
[1:15:42.140 --> 1:15:47.580]  that that was not a mistake when they said let people organize to kill us and it's still going
[1:15:47.580 --> 1:15:53.100]  on right now that's why they defend antifa for the defend blm all of it this is so dangerous

[1:18:05.100 --> 1:18:13.500]  control the UN WHO openly say they want to depopulate brown people it is absurdist that apple and
[1:18:13.500 --> 1:18:19.580]  google and nike have slave factories in china the worst on the planet and then lecture white people
[1:18:19.580 --> 1:18:24.540]  in america how they're bad to black people and now all of the world people are taking means
[1:18:24.540 --> 1:18:31.020]  trying to overthrow police and put leftist in control this is a totally sickening disgusting
[1:18:31.020 --> 1:18:36.540]  joke you ever heard the saying keep your friends close enemies closer leftists are evil and they
[1:18:36.540 --> 1:18:43.420]  divide and conquer people but at the heart of them is a eugenics based depopulation operation
[1:18:43.420 --> 1:18:48.300]  why aren't black lives matter at cold springs harbour in new york where they run the whole
[1:18:48.300 --> 1:18:53.260]  operation trying to topple statues why aren't they at the united nations because they're controlled
[1:18:53.260 --> 1:19:01.580]  by the UN and being directed by their masters david ronka feller and other satanic pieces of
[1:19:01.580 --> 1:19:08.940]  garbage who thought they'd set up their world government believe they pulled the drain on america
[1:19:08.940 --> 1:19:16.940]  a long time ago but if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design if there is a mass
[1:19:16.940 --> 1:19:24.940]  awakening it can be their unraveling their destruction and then going down the drain
[1:19:24.940 --> 1:19:30.060]  the bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us they themselves fall into it
[1:19:30.060 --> 1:19:36.140]  but god is the master of the universe but gives us free will and this plan is a test it is up to us
[1:19:36.140 --> 1:19:41.740]  to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain
[1:19:41.740 --> 1:19:47.500]  i cannot express the listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are everything hinges
[1:19:47.500 --> 1:19:55.500]  on you everything peacefully become the paul revere you know you've always been god bless and good luck
[1:20:00.300 --> 1:20:02.940]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:02.940 --> 1:20:16.860]  all right alex jones back live on this tuesday june 23rd show james oakief and project veritas
[1:20:16.860 --> 1:20:21.660]  have knocked it out of the park so many times that i don't know how to describe each new level
[1:20:21.660 --> 1:20:27.100]  but zack mackleroy was a facebook insider james oakief's here project veritas dot com
[1:20:27.100 --> 1:20:29.820]  if you're a radio listener you've got to go to project veritas dot com
[1:20:29.820 --> 1:20:35.820]  you can actually see the full video with major moderators and managers at facebook saying
[1:20:36.380 --> 1:20:39.820]  if someone's wearing a mega hat i'm going to delete them for terrorism
[1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:47.100]  so there they are you wonder what's going on here it is so james you take over with zack for the
[1:20:47.100 --> 1:20:52.620]  nine minutes we have police hey thanks alex yeah this is a pretty extraordinary expose
[1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:58.060]  because zack is a whistleblower worked for as a content moderator came to us at project veritas
[1:20:58.060 --> 1:21:03.340]  and uh was basically willing to wear a camera so we had some of our other journalists go in
[1:21:04.220 --> 1:21:08.220]  to talk to some of the people that zack pointed out to us and we're able to corroborate a lot
[1:21:08.220 --> 1:21:13.340]  of this is one guy dan will a fellow content moderator and he says that facebook shadow
[1:21:13.340 --> 1:21:18.620]  bans the notorious for it they say they don't but it's clear that the content that comes up in the
[1:21:18.620 --> 1:21:24.860]  queue is targeting conservatives zack told me on the record sat down for an interview with me and
[1:21:24.860 --> 1:21:29.980]  said that the 80 percent of the posts that are flagged before they go to content review the
[1:21:29.980 --> 1:21:37.020]  algorithm targets republicans so this is the first time we've ever seen this before a lot of those
[1:21:37.020 --> 1:21:41.740]  videos and images that you're seeing are some of them are recorded by zack some of them are recorded
[1:21:41.740 --> 1:21:46.540]  by some of the other people that work at project veritas so i just think it's wrong for these
[1:21:46.540 --> 1:21:53.740]  companies to lie under oath i think there are laws against perjury so really the issue is what are
[1:21:53.740 --> 1:21:59.180]  the people in congress going to do about it zack's want to testify and and alex we have
[1:21:59.180 --> 1:22:04.380]  other whistleblowers that are about to come public at what point is uh what point does anything
[1:22:04.380 --> 1:22:09.180]  happen because you've got election meddling in the company you have i was about to say you guys
[1:22:09.180 --> 1:22:15.660]  have caught total election meddling in line to conquerors red handed red handed election meddling
[1:22:15.660 --> 1:22:22.460]  that that 2016 pales in comparison to what we have in this one video so it's really not about
[1:22:22.460 --> 1:22:27.420]  election meddling it's it's really to them yeah imagine if we had undercover videos of russians
[1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:32.220]  controlling our telecommunications saying we censor this whole group we'd have them but no
[1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:37.500]  it's actually the democrats and big tech yeah they don't but it's not about election meddling not in
[1:22:37.500 --> 1:22:42.220]  the abstract it isn't what they really want is they believe that the results of the election
[1:22:42.220 --> 1:22:47.740]  improve that they've failed in their mission in 2016 so you have brave whistleblowers like zack we
[1:22:47.740 --> 1:22:53.900]  have a gofundme page for zack and again alex as always more people coming to project veritas thanks
[1:22:53.900 --> 1:22:58.940]  to you thanks to your audience uh some of these people exist amongst your audience and want to
[1:22:58.940 --> 1:23:03.740]  be brave and actually do something about the problem we need more people like zack to come public
[1:23:03.740 --> 1:23:09.900]  and tell their stories and wear a camera and expose what's going on zack you guys have a
[1:23:09.900 --> 1:23:15.180]  thousand points the time we have what do you want to impart the viewers oh i want to impart the
[1:23:15.180 --> 1:23:21.580]  importance of ending tech censorship you know you cannot have a conservative movement if it if
[1:23:21.580 --> 1:23:29.100]  you're not allowed to speak your mind online the uh the digital town square today is the most important
[1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:35.020]  thing everybody speaks online everybody exists online if you try and uh stifle free speech in
[1:23:35.020 --> 1:23:40.060]  that regard you're going to absolutely kill a movement before it even begins you know i think
[1:23:40.060 --> 1:23:45.980]  we can't see any change unless we see well i don't think we can see any change in the country until
[1:23:45.980 --> 1:23:53.660]  we see any change in this tech censorship we need to see dc we need to see congressional reform we
[1:23:53.660 --> 1:23:59.500]  need to see legislative legislation and that's what i am hoping for and that's what i'm willing to
[1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:04.940]  contribute to let me ask you about this with a hundred and twenty thirty two days left we can't
[1:24:04.940 --> 1:24:10.380]  wait i mean what can trump do executively now to stand up against this because big tech just seems
[1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:16.540]  like they don't care they just disregard well it's it's uh i know that at least one congressman has
[1:24:16.540 --> 1:24:20.300]  is writing a letter to the department of justice right now based upon zack's tapes and
[1:24:20.940 --> 1:24:25.820]  perjury issues because mark zuckerberg testified under oath that they were not biased i think one
[1:24:25.820 --> 1:24:31.820]  thing that we can ask for is transparency alex in other words we want to see these algorithms zack
[1:24:31.820 --> 1:24:37.580]  saying there's some type of algorithm that exists that that that pulls content that is of a republican
[1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:44.140]  nature for review by a ratio of three to one or four so the filter set to target conservatives
[1:24:44.140 --> 1:24:51.900]  to persecute yes and then they give that stuff to human beings for content review so that algorithm
[1:24:51.900 --> 1:24:56.780]  we want to see the algorithm we deserve to if this was happening on the other end of spectrum
[1:24:56.780 --> 1:25:00.780]  we would see the algorithm in a minute so we're trying to see that algorithm we want transparency
[1:25:00.780 --> 1:25:05.020]  yeah imagine there was an algorithm about what color somebody gets an admission to college or
[1:25:05.020 --> 1:25:10.540]  for a home loan we'd see that algorithm right now yeah and they're saying they don't do this alex
[1:25:10.540 --> 1:25:15.900]  they're they're denying that this is even real that's the key they've all testified google facebook
[1:25:15.900 --> 1:25:20.940]  twitter youtube the subsidiaries that they don't do this when they're red handed doing it that's
[1:25:20.940 --> 1:25:25.500]  right zuckerberg's under oath we're about to release this little clip in a minute of them
[1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:32.140]  testifying that there is no bias so what zuckerberg has essentially done here is he's subcontracted out
[1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:40.140]  his is his bias to these third party companies like the one that zack worked for this facebook
[1:25:40.140 --> 1:25:45.420]  cognizant outfit which is where all these content reviewers do their business because zuckerberg
[1:25:45.420 --> 1:25:50.060]  wants maybe plausible deniability or a degree of separation from the hell's angels gets banned in a
[1:25:50.060 --> 1:25:56.140]  town they create a sub motorcycle gang that's all he's done is like a mafia created little sub families
[1:25:56.780 --> 1:26:01.100]  yeah and this is the cognizant company that zack worked in and and and these are all the people
[1:26:01.100 --> 1:26:05.820]  that you're seeing on this on this videotape and and and and some of them worked for excenture
[1:26:05.820 --> 1:26:11.580]  steve grimmett who was a guy that worked for excenture hired by facebook and they say that
[1:26:11.580 --> 1:26:16.860]  quote facebook is a very progressive company in anti maga and they did a good job policing
[1:26:16.860 --> 1:26:21.820]  trump supporters there is laura kontakos a content moderator from cognizant and uh talking
[1:26:21.820 --> 1:26:27.500]  about taking down posts for political re this is the first time we've ever seen this inside facebook
[1:26:27.500 --> 1:26:32.540]  facebook was supposed to be the moderate company whereas jack dorsey at twitter was a little more
[1:26:32.540 --> 1:26:37.660]  activist and we know that mark zuckerberg is trying to curry favor with with the president oh we know
[1:26:37.660 --> 1:26:43.420]  they lie to his face they all lie to his face but i think potas has seen this expose today i i think
[1:26:43.420 --> 1:26:48.540]  he's i i've heard that he's seen it and i believe that he will this will change his tune as it
[1:26:48.540 --> 1:26:53.500]  pertains to facebook well exactly and and and james no one needs to talk about how great your
[1:26:53.500 --> 1:26:57.020]  organization is but you literally we wouldn't be where we are if it wasn't for your leadership
[1:26:57.020 --> 1:27:00.940]  and your great cruise leadership but when you say the potas has seen this has been pissed off
[1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:05.660]  that's big news in and of itself so uh you know the fact is they're not just evil this universe
[1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:09.980]  there's the whistleblowers there's your organization that's what we're all doing together well they're
[1:27:09.980 --> 1:27:14.220]  trying to is and and they're and alex they're trying to curry favor with with trump that's
[1:27:14.220 --> 1:27:19.420]  what facebook wants to become buddy buddy and they haven't tried to curry favor with me i can
[1:27:19.420 --> 1:27:23.340]  tell you that we're we're we're very independent here and uh oh they're keeping their enemy closer
[1:27:23.340 --> 1:27:28.780]  i'm sure trump gets that yes i i've read reports that they're whining and dining trump in the white
[1:27:28.780 --> 1:27:33.900]  house but the bottom line is i think he's seen that he has seen this i think this will probably
[1:27:33.900 --> 1:27:38.540]  upset him and will tell him the truth that this is the biggest election meddling you've ever seen
[1:27:38.540 --> 1:27:43.980]  and our call to action is they will do this more intensely as we get closer to november
[1:27:43.980 --> 1:27:47.580]  and we just want people to tell their stories we're the only one of the only places that
[1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:52.380]  people can come to with videotape we give them the camera as we have their back zack has a go

[1:32:55.660 --> 1:33:10.380]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:25.900 --> 1:33:40.780]  you know the best part about my 26 years on air is all the people i've got to me
[1:33:42.460 --> 1:33:46.940]  sometimes i've sat there driving on a long road trip thought about the things we've done together
[1:33:46.940 --> 1:33:56.460]  all the people i met charlton heston to the head of an air force weapons development to
[1:33:57.820 --> 1:34:05.180]  buzz aldrin the list just keeps going from there the hollywood people aren't even on the list
[1:34:07.980 --> 1:34:11.500]  but on the list of people i'm proud to know are those whistleblowers
[1:34:11.500 --> 1:34:17.820]  are the people that lost their career their job everything to tell the truth one of those people
[1:34:17.820 --> 1:34:25.340]  is zack mackleroy facebook insider goes there works there gets in and is there with high-level
[1:34:25.340 --> 1:34:32.060]  managers that are bragging about the systematic discrimination against people that wear a maga
[1:34:32.060 --> 1:34:35.900]  hat and we've had an earlier project where i talked to videos where twitter employees are like
[1:34:36.540 --> 1:34:40.940]  well who do you ban well they like alex jones he's the number one enemy or an american flag
[1:34:40.940 --> 1:34:47.660]  or a veteran don't you know it's folks that are veterans and care about the american flag that
[1:34:47.660 --> 1:34:51.820]  literally hold the country together but so these people see that as a threat they want power they
[1:34:51.820 --> 1:34:57.500]  want control they see an active informed engaged person who could be white who could be black who
[1:34:57.500 --> 1:35:01.740]  could be hispanic who could be asian they see that person as a threat because they got their
[1:35:02.380 --> 1:35:06.380]  life squared away and they just think we could tear it down we could run it
[1:35:06.380 --> 1:35:12.540]  and so zack i can ask a lot of questions in this segment about you going public in the
[1:35:12.540 --> 1:35:16.220]  big veritas video and the president seeing it and where this is going and the proof of their
[1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:21.020]  perjury i mean this is death star plan level stuff this is probably the biggest tech whistleblowing
[1:35:21.020 --> 1:35:25.340]  stuff yet but but but what are points you want to impart to viewers and listeners
[1:35:26.940 --> 1:35:33.260]  oh impart some points i think it's uh really important to keep in mind how important tech
[1:35:33.260 --> 1:35:38.700]  censorship is how important free speech on the internet is and uh don't forget you know
[1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:43.500]  you've got people at this uh company and other companies like this that do this job
[1:35:43.500 --> 1:35:47.580]  who are essentially in control of the digital town square you know they are
[1:35:49.420 --> 1:35:54.940]  what you say and what you can and can't say is essentially at the hands of people who are
[1:35:55.580 --> 1:36:01.020]  employed in mostly left-leaning liberal states almost all of them are left-leaning and they're
[1:36:01.020 --> 1:36:06.300]  in charge of what you can and can't say remember that and i have to say that i thank you for your
[1:36:06.300 --> 1:36:13.180]  kind words i am proud to be an insider i think the biggest uh the the best quote i just love project
[1:36:13.180 --> 1:36:21.340]  veritas's quote be brave do something because that's what it takes again if i jump in you'll never
[1:36:21.340 --> 1:36:26.300]  get a word in edgewise i agree so just give us your give us your data dump what you want to impart
[1:36:26.860 --> 1:36:29.980]  oh absolutely you want a data dump you want me to talk about some of the more uh some of the
[1:36:29.980 --> 1:36:34.460]  more egregious bits of censorship well i could ask that or i since you're asking since you're
[1:36:34.460 --> 1:36:41.180]  begging the question the mindset of the chicken crap dimension behavior of vitriolically getting
[1:36:41.180 --> 1:36:49.340]  off on suppressing people i mean i would feel like a sack of garbage if i was behaving like that
[1:36:50.540 --> 1:36:53.900]  well i guess i can't speak to that because i'm not like that you know i guess i can't say what
[1:36:53.900 --> 1:36:59.260]  it's like to uh have such as you said vitriol for people who you disagree with because i just don't
[1:36:59.260 --> 1:37:05.100]  i don't know i just don't do that i think all these ideologically driven uh actions and motives
[1:37:05.100 --> 1:37:10.540]  are seen on the level of the content moderators as well as at facebook themselves you know all of
[1:37:10.540 --> 1:37:15.820]  the exceptions to these policies that we talked about you know they had an exception for the uh
[1:37:15.820 --> 1:37:20.140]  the alabama abortion law that was passed last year there was an image that was trending on
[1:37:20.140 --> 1:37:25.580]  instagram for a while it said something the effect of men shouldn't be making laws about women's bodies
[1:37:25.580 --> 1:37:30.220]  now actually normally by their own standards that actually violates hate speech that should
[1:37:30.220 --> 1:37:36.860]  have been taken down for hate speech for political excuse me political exclusion of gender men and
[1:37:36.860 --> 1:37:40.700]  they admitted as much they said that this is something that should normally be taken down
[1:37:40.700 --> 1:37:44.620]  but they made an exception for it they decided that it was newsworthy content so they wanted to
[1:37:44.620 --> 1:37:50.300]  leave it up so that's one example of facebook acting in an ideological manner to selectively
[1:37:50.300 --> 1:37:55.260]  exclude some things and they set this up and say it's open and free and lie to you while they're
[1:37:55.260 --> 1:38:01.660]  behind the scenes engaging in fraud oh absolutely and it gets it gets even more infuriating than
[1:38:01.660 --> 1:38:07.820]  that you've we've seen something along the lines of uh well when the uh when we saw the
[1:38:07.820 --> 1:38:13.100]  solomani situation the solomani was killed uh shortly after that i think there was some
[1:38:13.100 --> 1:38:18.460]  iranian pee uh some iranian politician that had put a bounty on donald trump's head very famously
[1:38:18.460 --> 1:38:24.460]  for many millions of dollars and uh we saw in response to that we saw a trend of people posting
[1:38:24.460 --> 1:38:30.540]  a map a picture of a map and i they drew an arrow and they said dear iran this is where trump is
[1:38:30.540 --> 1:38:38.540]  he's on the golf course and it's very implicitly very clearly uh espousing some uh sentiment agreeing
[1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:42.940]  with basically telling iran to assassinate the president these people are basically telling
[1:38:42.940 --> 1:38:49.260]  iran to assassinate the president and facebook decided to allow this they said that this was uh
[1:38:49.260 --> 1:38:55.020]  uh this was not explicit enough this was too implicit so they allowed these posts of people
[1:38:55.980 --> 1:39:01.900]  pointing to iran dear iran he's on the golf course and uh essentially allowing people to agree with
[1:39:01.900 --> 1:39:05.820]  the president being assassinated but all these other things that yeah you gotta take all those
[1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:12.460]  things down but not this how do you think facebook is internally responding to you
[1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:16.540]  excelling this bombshell video that we haven't gotten to because you're here live talking about
[1:39:16.540 --> 1:39:22.620]  it but it's on info wars dot com and project veritas dot com i mean i like i can't be happy
[1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:27.580]  i can't imagine how they're uh responding i uh well i guess we'll see in the coming days i'm
[1:39:27.580 --> 1:39:31.580]  looking for a true response i'm looking for a true response from mark zuckerberg i think i'm
[1:39:31.580 --> 1:39:35.980]  also very curious to see your response from congress i want to see legislative action be
[1:39:35.980 --> 1:39:40.380]  taken about this as i've said i've got to keep hammering that home something has to be done
[1:39:40.380 --> 1:39:47.900]  about this we have to do something we have to see some pressure put on them more than pressure we need
[1:39:47.900 --> 1:39:54.220]  we need things to change and if more people like me can come out and you know see what i did maybe
[1:39:54.220 --> 1:39:58.700]  be inspired to do the same thing all the better and i think that's what's gonna take i think a
[1:39:58.700 --> 1:40:05.820]  giant tidal wave a tsunami of insiders will be before they get full ai in control and they're
[1:40:05.820 --> 1:40:10.620]  still using human intelligence we have to have the humans come out and expose and jack knife the
[1:40:10.620 --> 1:40:17.500]  entire system indeed absolutely and i'll say if you agree with what's been done and if you feel
[1:40:17.500 --> 1:40:24.380]  inspired and you're on the inside you know send an email or send a line to i think it's uh veritas
[1:40:24.380 --> 1:40:30.300]  tips at proton mail dot com and uh definitely speak to project veritas they'll do you right
[1:40:30.300 --> 1:40:35.100]  they will and and let's expand on that how do people find where you are because you're undoubtedly
[1:40:35.100 --> 1:40:40.060]  have you been persecuted yet for what you've done well not yet i guess it was released this morning
[1:40:40.060 --> 1:40:44.940]  and a lot of people were you know a lot of people in our sphere of politics were very happy about it
[1:40:44.940 --> 1:40:48.940]  but i think probably the people who don't like it haven't well hadn't woken up yet so i guess we'll
[1:40:48.940 --> 1:40:53.180]  have to see what they have to say about it let's talk about what is the culture because i watch
[1:40:53.180 --> 1:41:00.780]  these videos of really troll like very very wicked like art type of villains giggling and laughing
[1:41:00.780 --> 1:41:06.380]  how they suppress people oh you like trump i wish he was a terrorist no one ever sees you ha i mean
[1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:11.580]  it's very frightening actually oh yeah absolutely i mean you know these are like i said these are
[1:41:11.580 --> 1:41:15.980]  people that's that's just the that's just the culture and i can't i can't speak for it i'm not
[1:41:15.980 --> 1:41:21.580]  that kind of person so it's been uh really a review and they're like just sjw one up in each other
[1:41:22.780 --> 1:41:27.340]  yeah i mean i wouldn't be surprised i think they're all uh you know they're it's it's just their
[1:41:27.340 --> 1:41:33.020]  politics i guess you know what else can i say how do they feel like you said like they're the victim
[1:41:33.020 --> 1:41:37.340]  so they've got to rape us it's like i'm the victim i'm the trillion dollar company so i'm gonna rape
[1:41:37.340 --> 1:41:45.020]  you i couldn't speak for that it's just all very egregious it's all very uh it's it's also tiresome
[1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:53.980]  how do people find you online zack mackerel right yeah so my twitter is uh zack that's with an h c a c h

[1:42:39.420 --> 1:42:43.660]  expose facebook and you're set to testify before congress we'll be watching that we'll be covering
[1:42:43.660 --> 1:42:51.020]  it live thank you so much i will be right back with the proof that wearing mask is not mandatory
[1:42:51.020 --> 1:42:58.780]  you don't want to miss this i'm always excited about info wars life products they're amazing
[1:42:58.780 --> 1:43:02.860]  they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they find the info war in the face of the globalist
[1:43:02.860 --> 1:43:11.740]  onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing the only
[1:43:11.740 --> 1:43:19.580]  organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it and there's another
[1:43:19.580 --> 1:43:27.900]  innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick gross you goo but it's high
[1:43:27.900 --> 1:43:32.860]  quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way i like to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my
[1:43:32.860 --> 1:43:38.700]  face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it around your eyes but i just love it personally
[1:43:38.700 --> 1:43:43.420]  has something that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real innovation i don't know why others
[1:43:43.420 --> 1:43:48.380]  didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't
[1:43:48.380 --> 1:43:53.340]  dry you out it smells great it's so refreshing this is a big winner
[1:43:56.780 --> 1:44:02.460]  david ronka feller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they've set up their
[1:44:02.460 --> 1:44:10.780]  world government believe they pulled the drain on america a long time ago but if we understand
[1:44:10.780 --> 1:44:20.060]  that they've orchestrated this by design if there is a mass awakening it can be their unraveling
[1:44:20.780 --> 1:44:25.820]  their destruction and then going down the drain the bible tells us that many times when the enemy
[1:44:25.820 --> 1:44:31.740]  digs a pit for us they themselves fall into it but god is the master of the universe but gives us
[1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:36.860]  free will on this planet as a test it is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain
[1:44:36.860 --> 1:44:42.620]  or whether the globalists are going down the drain i cannot express the listeners and viewers
[1:44:42.620 --> 1:44:49.740]  of this broadcast how important you are everything hinges on you everything peacefully become the
[1:44:49.740 --> 1:44:57.580]  paul revere you know you've always been god bless and good luck i was talking to my patriot
[1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:02.700]  supplier great suppliers you can now say four weeks on average for storable food it's the highest
[1:45:02.700 --> 1:45:08.460]  quality they've got it use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service
[1:45:08.460 --> 1:45:13.420]  get some air before you get sucked back down i personally am ordering more storable food
[1:45:13.420 --> 1:45:18.380]  i have to now start going into defense posture 80 percent's offense but i've always been 100
[1:45:18.380 --> 1:45:23.180]  percent offense trying to fully you know stop the globalists and we've given them a good run
[1:45:23.180 --> 1:45:28.140]  and i think down the road they'll be defeated but we're gonna still go down the hard road now
[1:45:28.140 --> 1:45:33.500]  there were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down but uh we've mitigated some of this but it's
[1:45:33.500 --> 1:45:37.580]  it's still gonna be bad my view you need to get high quality for the food it's something you need
[1:45:37.580 --> 1:45:42.060]  we have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins so please

[1:45:47.500 --> 1:45:52.620]  so you get it so you have it some great containers high quality last 25 years get it while you can
[1:45:52.620 --> 1:45:57.260]  because if you think things are about to let up you ain't seen nothing yet one of our best selling
[1:45:57.260 --> 1:46:02.380]  products is living defense and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source
[1:46:02.380 --> 1:46:06.140]  the ingredients that are organic we've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out
[1:46:06.140 --> 1:46:09.900]  fast and i want those of you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself
[1:46:09.900 --> 1:46:15.100]  here's just part of one testimonial i looked in january 2016 i went in a hospital i went to va
[1:46:15.100 --> 1:46:19.580]  hospital out here in boise and i was in there until june and one of the only things that got me
[1:46:19.580 --> 1:46:25.340]  through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and i kept hearing dr group and all
[1:46:25.340 --> 1:46:30.060]  you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something man i had an internal digestive
[1:46:30.060 --> 1:46:34.620]  problem and i suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every
[1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:38.940]  time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you and dr group
[1:46:38.940 --> 1:46:42.700]  and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense now
[1:46:42.700 --> 1:46:46.300]  i wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff but i ordered
[1:46:46.300 --> 1:46:51.820]  it had it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking it man that stuff changed
[1:46:51.820 --> 1:46:55.980]  my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my life
[1:46:59.740 --> 1:47:13.660]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:13.660 --> 1:47:27.500]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:47:27.500 --> 1:47:47.020]  all right ladies and gentlemen we have more big guests coming up today
[1:47:48.060 --> 1:47:51.580]  not just james o'keith and gab mcgannis and a big facebook whistleblower but more
[1:47:51.580 --> 1:48:01.180]  we'll reveal that next hour but i have been in conversations with neighbors and friends and
[1:48:01.180 --> 1:48:08.620]  family and i tell them you know the establishment always creates loopholes for themselves
[1:48:10.300 --> 1:48:15.820]  like you know the owners of apple and google pay almost no tax zero corporate
[1:48:15.820 --> 1:48:21.180]  i mean you know they've all got armed guards and guns but they don't want you to have a gun
[1:48:21.820 --> 1:48:25.740]  you know they get clean vaccines you get contaminated dirty ones i can show you the one in
[1:48:25.740 --> 1:48:34.300]  guardian and even friends and family go alex there's no waiver in california or texas or other
[1:48:34.300 --> 1:48:42.780]  states that you don't have to wear a mask in a store and then i pull it up and i say california dot
[1:48:42.780 --> 1:48:45.580]  go
[1:48:48.860 --> 1:48:56.460]  and they go like porky pig of course they can't make you wear this
[1:48:57.580 --> 1:49:02.540]  a the study show doesn't protect you from covid 19 and then covid 19 is greatly exaggerated and
[1:49:02.540 --> 1:49:07.420]  they list all the regular deaths from other things on covid 19 it was 22 times less deaths
[1:49:07.420 --> 1:49:11.980]  than they said they would and bill gates put out the main test all over the world that give false
[1:49:11.980 --> 1:49:18.700]  positives i mean it's fraud on fraud on fraud you see a pile of dog manure in your yard
[1:49:19.500 --> 1:49:24.300]  you don't go i wonder if that's 90 dog manure or a hundred percent
[1:49:29.660 --> 1:49:34.060]  the whole thing from one end to the other here's another gross example you're driving down the road
[1:49:34.060 --> 1:49:38.780]  the middle of west texas you see a dead deer this flies all over it's obviously been dead four or five
[1:49:38.780 --> 1:49:42.940]  days you get out you look at it you need to kick it over to know there's maggots in there
[1:49:46.300 --> 1:49:54.140]  the eyeballs have been eaten by crows that's not good meat the whole things are rotten fraud
[1:49:54.700 --> 1:50:01.660]  every aspect every angle and they sent people that had pneumonia or the flu to nursing homes
[1:50:02.220 --> 1:50:07.100]  to kill the old people to get their numbers up that turns out now 59 percent according to the
[1:50:07.100 --> 1:50:14.780]  nih they don't even hide it of the death of covid 19 out of 110 000 are people in nursing homes they
[1:50:14.780 --> 1:50:24.860]  killed but family members they couldn't visit because they didn't want you to see them killing
[1:50:24.860 --> 1:50:36.220]  them and getting that 52 000 bounty the mask are about compliance for the forced inoculations
[1:50:36.220 --> 1:50:41.820]  and for the covid 19 tracking tracing that's coming out on the cell phones run by bill
[1:50:41.820 --> 1:50:48.140]  umland the gates foundation and the clinton global initiative i'm going to show you us
[1:50:48.140 --> 1:50:53.180]  say today in a moment saying that that's right the clinton's with big tech with apple and google
[1:50:53.900 --> 1:50:58.540]  with bill gates are going to run the system that tracks where you go and what you do and
[1:50:58.540 --> 1:51:03.580]  where you can eat and what jobs you can have and they say if you just take the vaccine
[1:51:03.580 --> 1:51:12.860]  we'll have your little icon on your phone say you're in like flin talk about a call
[1:51:15.660 --> 1:51:21.020]  the good news is gates tried to come out as our savior like the pervert you know coming into
[1:51:21.020 --> 1:51:26.060]  the little girl's room and she said mommy rapist so he kind of crept out of the room now because
[1:51:26.060 --> 1:51:30.620]  people didn't buy it and that's the thing they think they got all the control but they got
[1:51:30.620 --> 1:51:35.660]  missing pieces because they're statements but let's go ahead for tv viewers radio listeners
[1:51:35.660 --> 1:51:41.500]  i'll go over this for you let's go over the color of law fraud these petty tyrants
[1:51:45.180 --> 1:51:49.260]  the governor california sets the precedent and i told you other states would follow
[1:51:49.260 --> 1:51:54.620]  and then governor greg abbott is now literally the mini me of
[1:51:54.620 --> 1:52:03.180]  governor psycho new some he followed his orders so texas is not just being colonized by california
[1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:11.020]  rejects now we are now under governor new some governor gabin new some is the governor of texas
[1:52:12.140 --> 1:52:19.020]  the governor resigned earlier yesterday and has appointed the california governor as our governor
[1:52:19.020 --> 1:52:25.180]  i mean he's might as well his earlier instincts were right that it's all hoax but not now because
[1:52:25.180 --> 1:52:33.260]  he can grandstand so here's california department of public safety june 18 2020 that's five days ago
[1:52:34.380 --> 1:52:39.580]  guidance for use of face coverings because it's all guidance it's not a law it's all a con
[1:52:41.740 --> 1:52:46.780]  the following individuals are exempt from wearing a face covering persons age two or years under
[1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:52.540]  persons with a medical condition mental health condition or disability that prevents wearing
[1:52:52.540 --> 1:52:57.580]  a mask covering you have anxiety you have asthma you're exempt physical as persons with a medical
[1:52:57.580 --> 1:53:02.700]  condition for whom wearing a face covering would obstruct breathing or who are unconscious

[1:53:08.460 --> 1:53:14.700]  hearing impaired or communicating with the person who is hearing impaired or the ability to see the
[1:53:14.700 --> 1:53:20.620]  mouth is essential she's telling your death persons for whom wearing a face covering would
[1:53:20.620 --> 1:53:25.500]  create a risk to the person related to the work as determined by local state federal and regulations
[1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:30.860]  and work safe guidelines yeah they just passed along california you're exempt of your brown
[1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:35.900]  wearing mask i'm not joking i'll show it to you persons who are obtaining a service involving
[1:53:35.900 --> 1:53:40.300]  the nose or face for temporary removal the face covering is necessary to perform the service
[1:53:40.300 --> 1:53:44.940]  i was trying to get my haircut the other day and they said oh you need to wear a i said i want my
[1:53:44.940 --> 1:53:48.860]  beard trimmed and they said literally on the phone they said well you got to wear a mask i said i'll
[1:53:48.860 --> 1:53:57.580]  do it myself and i did with clippers and a comb persons are seated at a restaurant other
[1:53:57.580 --> 1:54:03.500]  establishment that offers food or beverages so you can eat i remember watching women with
[1:54:03.500 --> 1:54:08.140]  burkas eat under their burka persons who are engaged in outdoor work or recreation such as
[1:54:08.140 --> 1:54:14.780]  swimming walking hiking oh the if i want to swim i'd wear a mask thank you rob dude was out at
[1:54:14.780 --> 1:54:20.140]  krausie springs this weekend outside austin people were wearing masks in the in the natural pool
[1:54:22.700 --> 1:54:31.340]  the genius here persons who are incarcerated prisons or jails and it goes on so there's
[1:54:31.340 --> 1:54:38.060]  california okay there's no law it's a guideline it's all a fraud and it doesn't protect you
[1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:45.100]  so when he says it's the law do it it's made up by the homeless are also exempt let's look at austin
[1:54:45.100 --> 1:55:01.580]  look at texas here is the covet 19 guidelines and order the county of travis county off the state law
[1:55:01.580 --> 1:55:06.940]  section b face covering when leaving one's residents all persons over the age of 10 should
[1:55:06.940 --> 1:55:12.140]  wear some covering over the mouth the homemade mask are bananas it's all just a submission deal
[1:55:12.140 --> 1:55:20.220]  alone in a separate single space whether indoor or outdoor two in the presence only of members of
[1:55:20.220 --> 1:55:24.460]  one's household or residents should you take it off total cold control when
[1:55:27.260 --> 1:55:31.980]  pose a greater mental physical health safety and security risk so it goes on a safety of a
[1:55:31.980 --> 1:55:37.340]  mental problem i have to for purposes of eating or drinking wearing face covering is not a substitute
[1:55:37.340 --> 1:55:42.540]  for maintaining six feet social distancing hand washing and all the rest of their garbage it's a
[1:55:42.540 --> 1:55:49.180]  total call so if it mentally hurts you you don't have to this is a joke they don't care if it's a
[1:55:49.180 --> 1:55:57.660]  scarf they don't care if it's a face mask it's a lie it's that when we tell you to take a vaccine
[1:55:57.660 --> 1:56:08.780]  or we tell you to be tracked digitally by your cell phone you do it and that's all this is and so
[1:56:08.780 --> 1:56:15.740]  the phobia we have of these is the tyranny of the centralized control and of the bill and
[1:56:15.740 --> 1:56:20.700]  mullin gates foundation all their billions buying off the media and others even independent media
[1:56:20.700 --> 1:56:26.460]  to spout these lies apple and google release coronavirus contact crazy technology for public
[1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:36.700]  health mobile apps usa today and who runs it george soros and shelsey clinton on the board

[1:57:13.900 --> 1:57:19.180]  it's the globalist making their move and anybody back in mask anybody back in the lockdown is a

[1:57:30.140 --> 1:57:34.860]  and everybody groveling to this has set the stage for them to release mass culling weapons to kill

[2:00:19.660 --> 2:00:25.820]  us coming up right after this first segment but i wanted to hit a story that just went live
[2:00:25.820 --> 2:00:33.020]  live on info wars.com that only gets leggy weggies and has an effect it actually fights when you
[2:00:33.020 --> 2:00:40.700]  spread it texas governor abbott capitulates to california pushes mask of the beast to buy and
[2:00:40.700 --> 2:00:48.220]  sell so that no one can buy or sell unless they have the mask and it's all just the mark that

[2:01:02.300 --> 2:01:10.860]  till you take the vaccine very important article i hope the dog hunts the dog only hunts when you
[2:01:10.860 --> 2:01:23.980]  take action but wow so much more to get to you know andrew jackson we're going to play some
[2:01:23.980 --> 2:01:29.180]  of these clips here you guys just pick which ones are so many like you go watch the movie
[2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:36.380]  conan the barbarian and you know it's fantasy written in texas back in the depression and
[2:01:36.380 --> 2:01:45.580]  my heavyweight boxer and he comes off as not real but when you read about andrew jackson and
[2:01:45.580 --> 2:01:49.900]  the real stuff he did in his life it's like he was in the revolutionary war at age nine killed
[2:01:49.900 --> 2:01:55.500]  people by 10 mother brother everybody died in a british concentration camp and just his whole
[2:01:55.500 --> 2:02:01.820]  life like it stabbed shot nobody could kill him the guy was like a zombie and he literally expanded
[2:02:01.820 --> 2:02:07.020]  the united states beat the british again did all the stuff and they want to tear down a statue when
[2:02:07.020 --> 2:02:12.300]  he built all of this whether you like it or not this is andrew jackson like you run the country
[2:02:12.300 --> 2:02:17.180]  now why do you want to tear it down but it's an idea that people hate it but finally trump
[2:02:17.740 --> 2:02:21.580]  stood up against it here's some of those uh video clips of the hysteria last night
[2:02:21.580 --> 2:02:35.020]  and again they're saying he killed brown people he killed white people too so again the idea is
[2:02:35.020 --> 2:02:38.380]  it says he's white while they want to torn down well why are you trying to get in the country
[2:02:38.380 --> 2:02:53.500]  then i mean it's so bad i mean this is the big accomplishment is to pull down andrew jackson
[2:02:57.660 --> 2:03:01.020]  by the way andrew jackson will be embarrassed of that statue he didn't even like stuff like that
[2:03:01.020 --> 2:03:08.780]  he was like hey i'm dead and gone i didn't already did what i did you need to pull me down they just
[2:03:08.780 --> 2:03:14.940]  live off him and he is like super invincibility i mean the battle of new orleans he was at this
[2:03:14.940 --> 2:03:19.340]  barricade outnumbered by the british about three to one and he stood up there when the men were
[2:03:19.340 --> 2:03:24.540]  about to give up for two days in a black cloak they said the british saw like a demonic apparition
[2:03:24.540 --> 2:03:33.100]  and they all kept shooting at him at 300 yards for days and no one could shoot him like he got up
[2:03:33.100 --> 2:03:38.940]  on top instead of the british histories on top of the barricade and let them shoot at him
[2:03:41.100 --> 2:03:44.940]  and the british said it hundreds of yards away they could see his eyes glowing in the dark
[2:03:49.580 --> 2:03:52.780]  now whether you believe that it's true or not they put that in the histories the british
[2:03:52.780 --> 2:03:58.700]  didn't just write stuff into that for no reason totally freaked about so maybe he was evil hell
[2:03:58.700 --> 2:04:03.180]  like some big vampire bat sitting up there i mean i don't know who andrew jackson really was let me
[2:04:03.180 --> 2:04:13.820]  tell you they don't make him like that anymore so this is what everything has been turned into
[2:04:13.820 --> 2:04:19.580]  ladies and gentlemen people build a country in total war they try to empower the individual
[2:04:19.580 --> 2:04:24.300]  and then the people that are living off that say oh you're not inclusive enough
[2:04:25.340 --> 2:04:29.420]  and it's all a race-based psychology it's totally disgusting and now that they're
[2:04:29.420 --> 2:04:33.260]  exploiting black people for their new world order when the liberals can't you know find
[2:04:33.260 --> 2:04:40.300]  enough black kids to abort now aoc dresses up like bozo the clown and says that she's black
[2:04:41.260 --> 2:04:47.100]  you gotta bow down to her i mean this is all a dying system so as negative as stuff is
[2:04:47.100 --> 2:04:52.380]  let's just not let them take them down let's not let them take us down with them
[2:04:54.940 --> 2:05:00.860]  it's finally here introducing the first of its kind nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine
[2:05:00.860 --> 2:05:05.500]  listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[2:05:05.500 --> 2:05:10.540]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine after extensive development it's finally here our proprietary new
[2:05:10.540 --> 2:05:15.100]  aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from
[2:05:15.100 --> 2:05:19.580]  7 000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula i have been using the new
[2:05:19.580 --> 2:05:24.220]  x2 spray every day and i feel good knowing that i have the power of true nascent iodine working
[2:05:24.220 --> 2:05:28.620]  for my body i can personally feel the difference we know iodine is an essential mineral that
[2:05:28.620 --> 2:05:33.820]  supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism healthy hormone levels and healthy
[2:05:33.820 --> 2:05:38.220]  cognitive function iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and

[2:06:15.340 --> 2:06:21.020]  situation this idea that they were spying on your campaign you've been asked before about what crime
[2:06:21.020 --> 2:06:26.460]  he would have potentially committed but i remember you talking about treason treason it's treason look
[2:06:27.020 --> 2:06:32.620]  look when i came out a long time ago i said they've been spying on my campaign i said they've been
[2:06:32.620 --> 2:06:37.100]  taping and that was in quotes meaning a modern day version of taping it's all the same thing but a
[2:06:37.100 --> 2:06:42.220]  modern day version but they've been spying on my campaign i told you that a long time ago
[2:06:42.220 --> 2:06:50.620]  turned out i was right let's see what happens to him now durham is i never met durham because i want
[2:06:50.620 --> 2:06:55.980]  to stay out of it because otherwise it's going to look political but durham as you know is a highly
[2:06:55.980 --> 2:07:03.340]  respected person and bill bar is doing a great job as attorney general let's see what they come up with
[2:07:03.900 --> 2:07:10.300]  but they don't have to tell me all i have to do is read the papers the insurance policy
[2:07:10.300 --> 2:07:17.180]  in case she doesn't win we've got a insurance policy well that was all the stuff that we went
[2:07:17.180 --> 2:07:21.420]  through over the last let's say two and a half years now we caught him we caught him called
[2:07:21.420 --> 2:07:29.260]  struck and paged the two lovers uh brennan and clapper the way they lied democrats can't stand
[2:07:29.260 --> 2:07:34.540]  behind me they just they can't see in who bill bar they just think he's political you know why
[2:07:34.540 --> 2:07:42.380]  because he's doing such a good job because he's law and order but he's got him in his crosshairs
[2:07:43.260 --> 2:07:48.620]  and now we have to see what's going to happen i will say this if it were reversed and if the
[2:07:48.620 --> 2:07:53.900]  other side sat where at the oval office right in that chair behind the resolute desk and it was the
[2:07:53.900 --> 2:08:06.220]  opposite two years ago 25 people would have been convicted and they would be sent to jail for 50 years
[2:08:06.220 --> 2:08:10.940]  and trump's trying to pull us out of these wars and so he's the bad man no i'm very proud of trump
[2:08:10.940 --> 2:08:15.260]  he's the real deal and the whole new world order is crashing down right now so they're
[2:08:15.260 --> 2:08:20.380]  going to take us with them but it's not going to happen j direb is an author comedian tv

[2:08:48.700 --> 2:08:53.100]  that's pedophilia coming out in the open what's happening with trump the whole world thanks for
[2:08:53.100 --> 2:08:57.820]  joining us and they've got a big audience of folks we really appreciate your your perspective
[2:08:57.820 --> 2:09:01.820]  where do you want to start first on this uh tuesday june 23rd transmission
[2:09:02.940 --> 2:09:08.540]  well thanks for having me we can start with what you said when i watched you back in about 2004 or
[2:09:08.540 --> 2:09:14.620]  five i remember you very pointedly saying folks they're going to bring back human sacrifice the
[2:09:14.620 --> 2:09:22.860]  un agenda 21 agenda 2030 they're gonna it's it's Aztecs so i heard you say back then and i thought
[2:09:22.860 --> 2:09:27.580]  that was a little off right i was already kind of conspiracy woke at the time but i thought surely
[2:09:27.580 --> 2:09:34.300]  not and you know what i did alex i went and i got at my library about 40 50 of the elite books
[2:09:34.860 --> 2:09:40.220]  and i went through them all i plowed through them and sure enough you were right i actually tracked
[2:09:40.220 --> 2:09:45.820]  down examples of where global elitists like arthur kessler and goes to the machine he says you know
[2:09:45.820 --> 2:09:51.900]  what since everything is natural anything that occurs is natural so i'll just natural process
[2:09:52.780 --> 2:09:57.740]  all of history includes human sacrifice eat cannibalism these kinds of things it's all just
[2:09:57.740 --> 2:10:02.380]  natural there's nothing right so here is one of the top royal society type elites literally saying
[2:10:02.380 --> 2:10:06.620]  everything that you said so that's what i did i went and i launched into all these books i plowed
[2:10:06.620 --> 2:10:12.780]  in because you said that's what you did and lo and behold you were right let me tell you i remember
[2:10:12.780 --> 2:10:17.100]  20 years ago reading official you in documents where they said we should bring back human sacrifice
[2:10:17.100 --> 2:10:22.220]  the lower population and we should make pedophilia the center of the new family i'm not the one coming
[2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:28.300]  up with this but these people are crazy where do you think it stems from well ultimately the battle
[2:10:28.300 --> 2:10:34.140]  is spiritual as you know it's a cosmic you know primal battle between good and evil lucifer the
[2:10:34.140 --> 2:10:39.580]  fallen angel in fact i'm glad you mentioned that i was just reading in the last few weeks some of
[2:10:39.580 --> 2:10:44.460]  the psychonauts if you if you're familiar with tarence mackenna if you're familiar with tim leary
[2:10:44.460 --> 2:10:50.140]  you know all these guys working at the behest of the cia to promote the mk ultra slash mind control
[2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:56.620]  lsd phenomenon and one thing they consistently say is that like you found out when you were you know
[2:10:56.620 --> 2:11:01.820]  talking to joe rogan on that top podcast of all time you guys were talking about the float tanks
[2:11:01.820 --> 2:11:08.060]  and talking to the entities well i tracked down where they talk about that and john c lily right
[2:11:08.060 --> 2:11:14.220]  the famous dolphin creeper right who had a thing for dolphins well he also worked for the o and i
[2:11:14.220 --> 2:11:20.460]  worked for the cia in doing signals research and brain ship research back in the 50s that's why
[2:11:20.460 --> 2:11:25.180]  they recruited him and you know what he says in his autobiography says i went into the tanks
[2:11:25.180 --> 2:11:30.380]  and i went and i talked to the aliens and they told me how to come up with all this mind control
[2:11:30.380 --> 2:11:35.100]  that's what he says in his autobiography so once again you're proven right uh on the most popular
[2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:40.300]  podcast in well but but i mean enough about me that's the crazy part is we're not the crazy ones
[2:11:40.300 --> 2:11:45.660]  all of big tech is on record i've even talked to a few of the guys that are big names that aren't
[2:11:45.660 --> 2:11:49.580]  part of it but they're like asking can we defeat it because they're like on the fence should they
[2:11:49.580 --> 2:11:56.140]  join it and and they're literally in these meetings that they know they're talking to aliens but then
[2:11:56.140 --> 2:12:01.340]  the aliens tell them it's genetically imprinted on you yes and so it's actually true it's not just
[2:12:01.340 --> 2:12:05.100]  they're not just giving us the knowledge we've already it's like we've done it before or something
[2:12:05.100 --> 2:12:09.260]  it's like we're more advanced than them or an embryonic stage i've been figured it all out but
[2:12:09.260 --> 2:12:15.100]  this is crazy that's what lily says lily says that there's two programs in us he says there's a
[2:12:15.100 --> 2:12:20.060]  program but from biology that goes back to the you know ancient times and then there's this other
[2:12:20.060 --> 2:12:25.740]  program that they want to install in us to override that which is the next stage of evolution
[2:12:25.740 --> 2:12:29.660]  which you talked about yesterday i think when you were covering the wall street journal piece
[2:12:29.660 --> 2:12:35.260]  that next stage of evolution is seen to be the omega point which all of these technocrats and all
[2:12:35.260 --> 2:12:40.780]  of these what would seem to be counter establishment figures these sort of archaic revival let's go
[2:12:40.780 --> 2:12:47.420]  back to you know everybody just laying around in dirt and and filth you know being hippies basically
[2:12:47.420 --> 2:12:50.940]  they're actually the same movement they're all connected and you need to look no further than
[2:12:50.940 --> 2:12:54.780]  burning man they all go to burning man the tech elite they'd all trip their mind blow their minds
[2:12:54.780 --> 2:12:59.260]  out on acid and they have initiation rituals at burning man this is all confirmed now
[2:13:00.780 --> 2:13:03.580]  where do you think it's going and how do you think it's going for them
[2:13:05.820 --> 2:13:11.420]  unfortunately they are getting the upper hand so they've i just got demonetized the other day on
[2:13:11.420 --> 2:13:18.460]  youtube so uh in fact a year ago when info wars was banned across all platforms at the very same
[2:13:18.460 --> 2:13:25.820]  hour that you got banned i had my entire website deleted just no warnings no nothing just deleted
[2:13:25.820 --> 2:13:30.060]  like 10 years of movie analysis 10 years of research is deleted well it's important you
[2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:36.140]  say that because they use my banning as a cover for a mass ban yeah exactly yeah yeah well so it
[2:13:36.140 --> 2:13:40.700]  took me a month thousands of dollars to rebuild everything that i've done for 10 years um i did
[2:13:40.700 --> 2:13:45.100]  have it backed up but as you know it's just a nightmare to to play you know hopscotch they
[2:13:45.100 --> 2:13:48.540]  want you hopping around to all these different things and you can never build up right you have to
[2:13:48.540 --> 2:13:54.300]  constantly you're always spending your time just surviving instead of winning exactly exactly and
[2:13:54.300 --> 2:13:59.100]  that was the technocrat plan long ago i mean i remember you mentioned brzezinski and i would go
[2:13:59.100 --> 2:14:04.380]  and i i read grand chess board i read uh between two ages and i think what was amazing about between
[2:14:04.380 --> 2:14:10.620]  two ages that brzezinski says not only do we have to co-opt society and and bring this technocracy
[2:14:10.620 --> 2:14:15.740]  he even said religion he said religion needs to be co-opted we need to steer these churches and to
[2:14:15.740 --> 2:14:21.660]  becoming basically fake fronts for world council churches national council churches all rockefeller
[2:14:21.660 --> 2:14:26.460]  created stuff all in the rockefeller's biography they brag about it right the rockefeller has
[2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:31.820]  whole chapters on bilderberg on all that stuff so it was all what blew me away was that it's all in
[2:14:31.820 --> 2:14:37.020]  their books i mean brzezinski has a whole section on weather warfare right and he wrote that in what
[2:14:37.020 --> 2:14:42.700]  72 70 let me give you an example i was talking to a high-level cia guy just the other day
[2:14:42.700 --> 2:14:46.380]  i'm not bragging about it it's just a fact and he was just telling me i already knew all this
[2:14:46.380 --> 2:14:51.660]  piece like yeah we do maneuvers going back to the 80s with just the military doing a drill
[2:14:51.660 --> 2:14:57.020]  and we would black out the sky with with with the with the dishes we have that can create rain
[2:14:57.580 --> 2:15:01.740]  and he goes yeah no it's the local doppler radar we really control it it shows you doppler what's
[2:15:01.740 --> 2:15:06.460]  really going on but it's secondary and its main function is blocking out but sometimes we got to
[2:15:06.460 --> 2:15:11.340]  have jets fly over and spray it and that way the chinese and the russians can't see what our drill is
[2:15:11.340 --> 2:15:17.260]  now again i already know that but the general public doesn't get even it's somebody who's like
[2:15:18.460 --> 2:15:23.100]  well you know high-level cia darpa whatever but the troops all knew they were blocking it out
[2:15:23.100 --> 2:15:28.220]  all the green berets out there doing the drill for you know grabbing nuclear weapons from from
[2:15:28.220 --> 2:15:34.620]  the iranians they have a drill to raid iranian nukes they blocked the sun out for a week i mean
[2:15:34.620 --> 2:15:41.340]  that was in the 80s and 90s or whatever we'll come right back with jay dyer j is jaysanalysis.com
[2:15:41.340 --> 2:15:45.580]  great guy smart guy he doesn't need to pay me any more homage we pay him homage we pay all you
[2:15:45.580 --> 2:15:49.740]  homage i want to hear where he thinks this is all going on the other side straight ahead stay with us

[2:18:15.980 --> 2:18:21.900]  add new demands that people take force inoculations that they have contact tracing on their phones
[2:18:21.900 --> 2:18:26.780]  and that every aspect of our lives be controlled this is all complete and total preparation for
[2:18:26.780 --> 2:18:32.700]  world government forced inoculation and complete enslavement of the human population this is

[2:19:41.420 --> 2:19:44.700]  because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation
[2:19:44.700 --> 2:19:49.660]  just for the design of it and we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there

[2:20:49.180 --> 2:20:53.740]  into it what would you call this period of time we're living in one of the big topics and issues
[2:20:53.740 --> 2:20:57.500]  you want to hit that you want to cover for the listeners and viewers out there because to me
[2:20:57.500 --> 2:21:03.900]  this is just a crazy time i see the left committing sepico suicide going crazy but then i see all
[2:21:03.900 --> 2:21:08.620]  these other forces what do you think's really behind it all we talk about the trump dimension
[2:21:08.620 --> 2:21:13.340]  it's like we're entering the manson dimension you remember what manson talked about i would help
[2:21:13.340 --> 2:21:18.540]  just get there we're going to have jesus and loose for the same side of things manson literally said we
[2:21:18.540 --> 2:21:23.500]  would have race wars i'm not saying manson was a prophet he was obviously a lunatic but you know
[2:21:23.500 --> 2:21:28.940]  this blending of opposites this is all alchemical that i was talking about leary before leary said
[2:21:28.940 --> 2:21:33.340]  that the the age of transition this age that we're entering into he said it would be an
[2:21:33.340 --> 2:21:39.180]  alchemical transition to an omega point to a singularity which again you you talked about
[2:21:39.180 --> 2:21:46.380]  that in the past and so you know ironically the last of the global elites books that i got i've
[2:21:46.380 --> 2:21:53.740]  gone through about 45 or 50 of these now is claus claus from davos guess what claus has an entire
[2:21:53.740 --> 2:21:59.020]  chapter on which by the way if you talk about it you are a lunatic but claus has a whole chapter
[2:21:59.020 --> 2:22:03.340]  on geoengineering right so here is this book fourth industrial revolution this is where they're
[2:22:03.340 --> 2:22:07.580]  going this is where we are now great reset they just talked about this the entire week last week
[2:22:07.580 --> 2:22:11.980]  great reset time this is austerity this is everything the bank in the lead of plan 400 years
[2:22:11.980 --> 2:22:17.260]  technocracy and claus says that the internet of things nano technology biotech it's all
[2:22:17.260 --> 2:22:25.420]  going to roll in now this is the age of transition and the new vaccines are not vaccines they have
[2:22:25.420 --> 2:22:30.700]  nano tech that reprogram ourselves they skipped animal trials it's just here they're not they're
[2:22:30.700 --> 2:22:36.460]  not playing games now they're just moving on us absolutely yeah i mean remember brave new world
[2:22:36.460 --> 2:22:42.940]  we've all heard of this novel maybe not as many of us have read it uh i recently read it uh after
[2:22:42.940 --> 2:22:47.340]  reading it back in high school you know you don't even know what's going on and and what does he say
[2:22:47.340 --> 2:22:52.140]  in brave new world he says that we can't have mostopham on the world socialist controllers
[2:22:52.140 --> 2:22:58.620]  says we can't have the masses reading shakespeare watching you know good productions we've got to
[2:22:58.620 --> 2:23:04.300]  have this degenerate toxic culture and he says we have to keep even the real scientific discoveries
[2:23:04.300 --> 2:23:08.380]  from people this is what he tells john the savage in the novel the world socialist controller he says
[2:23:08.380 --> 2:23:12.060]  we have to do this because the people can't handle it they don't care they don't want to
[2:23:12.060 --> 2:23:17.500]  know that stuff so we have to dumb them down and destroy them so that is a game plan that is not
[2:23:17.500 --> 2:23:23.660]  an expose his brother ran the un this is a he said before he died in 62 this is our battle plan
[2:23:24.540 --> 2:23:31.420]  julian julian which as you know coined the term transhumanism he wrote unesco's philosophy
[2:23:31.420 --> 2:23:35.980]  go read that 50 page thing all he says in there is everything that the technocrats say he says
[2:23:35.980 --> 2:23:40.060]  we got to lie about everything about what we're really doing we got to pretend like we're liberals
[2:23:40.060 --> 2:23:45.180]  we're gonna we're gonna kill everybody off and it's he says it is it is eugenics right it's not
[2:23:45.180 --> 2:23:49.660]  eugenics in the sense of like well we're gonna pick one master race he says we're gonna pick
[2:23:49.660 --> 2:23:54.060]  like moon raker like you go jackson moon raker we'll pick the top from the different races
[2:23:54.060 --> 2:23:59.100]  and just kill everybody else off so the the breakaway civilization moon raker plan is real
[2:23:59.100 --> 2:24:04.380]  that's exactly what my dad was told as a junior in high school with the head of the body department
[2:24:04.380 --> 2:24:08.620]  running a secret eugenics operation he said listen we're not like the nazis we're just gonna kill all
[2:24:08.620 --> 2:24:13.340]  the dumb people we'll have the smart blacks the smart whites the smart jews the smart whatever
[2:24:13.340 --> 2:24:18.780]  and i mean these people really have a plan and they're running things so how does your plan is going
[2:24:20.380 --> 2:24:24.380]  well unfortunately right now they've moved they have rolled out a lot of the technocracy i mean
[2:24:24.380 --> 2:24:31.340]  if you look at the way the fortune 100 fortune 500 they they have coordinated efforts that have gone
[2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:36.940]  on for the last several years globally you see things culturally roll out and the entire corporate
[2:24:36.940 --> 2:24:41.260]  establishment across the world promotes it everywhere right all the banking all the elite
[2:24:41.260 --> 2:24:47.260]  they promote the same things covid was a great example of this right this koranka virus kufid
[2:24:47.260 --> 2:24:52.140]  hoax was nothing but a giant scyop they even wrote articles in the new scientist saying we're living
[2:24:52.140 --> 2:24:58.860]  through the greatest largest psychological operation in history well i could ask the
[2:24:58.860 --> 2:25:03.420]  questions here but you're definitely over the target what do you think they're going to pull
[2:25:03.420 --> 2:25:07.420]  next because they've they've pulled a lot of stuff lately it seems like 2020 is kind of a
[2:25:07.420 --> 2:25:14.140]  metaphysical esoteric year for them yeah a great point i i noticed that the patterns of what we've
[2:25:14.140 --> 2:25:20.860]  seen in 2020 tended to be election-based politics focused you know they're calling for this coup
[2:25:20.860 --> 2:25:26.700]  against trump but publicly biden does it with fumbling over his words fumbling carly hardly
[2:25:26.700 --> 2:25:32.060]  talk and then we see the cfr write that article about how it's time for the military to please
[2:25:32.060 --> 2:25:35.580]  get rid of this guy take him out this definitely needs to happen for justice right
[2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:40.540]  so we a lot of this is election focused but a lot of people are focused only on the election i always
[2:25:40.540 --> 2:25:46.140]  try to stay focused on the big picture and the big picture is to roll out this next phase this next
[2:25:46.140 --> 2:25:52.220]  business plan phase of the technocracy right ubi all of that i just came across an entire
[2:25:52.220 --> 2:25:57.020]  essay by one of the technocrats and i know you know about changing images of man remember willis
[2:25:57.020 --> 2:26:04.300]  harman in 1981 he wrote an essay about how they would have essential and non-essential workers
[2:26:04.300 --> 2:26:10.220]  that you would have to demonstrate your viability and usefulness to the collective to even have work
[2:26:10.220 --> 2:26:14.220]  or to have possessions right you're not going to have a car you're not going to have a phone
[2:26:14.220 --> 2:26:18.060]  you're going to have to demonstrate that you need those things for the society for the collective
[2:26:18.060 --> 2:26:23.740]  you'll be given a purpose right and in 1981 he said that ubi social credit system would be rolled
[2:26:23.740 --> 2:26:29.660]  out with essential and non-essential workers is that crazy and that's what bill gates is openly
[2:26:29.660 --> 2:26:34.860]  doing with his new education exactly imagine the ultimate racism level of not what color you are
[2:26:35.420 --> 2:26:42.300]  but this elite foggy computer decides if you're essential or not yeah remember
[2:26:42.300 --> 2:26:47.820]  treasure and hope a lot of people talk about the later chapter where quigley goes into the banking
[2:26:47.820 --> 2:26:52.780]  elite and the you know ruckfeller foundation all these different groups funding the leftist
[2:26:52.780 --> 2:26:56.940]  movements that's very important but a lot of people forget right smack in the middle of the book
[2:26:56.940 --> 2:27:02.620]  there is the chapter on the managerial society the managerial technocracy and even in that chapter
[2:27:02.620 --> 2:27:08.860]  quickly back in the 60s right he was basically writing this book exposing the cfr's entire approach
[2:27:08.860 --> 2:27:13.580]  to the to world government he was at georgia and he was bill clinton's mentor this is a
[2:27:13.580 --> 2:27:18.700]  key book it's crucial i've lectured through all 1300 pages of people want to go see my lectures
[2:27:18.700 --> 2:27:24.300]  and what he says is that there will be basically ai in cities running everything you'll live in
[2:27:24.300 --> 2:27:31.420]  just like you've talked about white box you know barren cities of computers running everything
[2:27:31.420 --> 2:27:35.580]  it would be it would be like living in a walmart you're going to live on the isle of walmart
[2:27:35.580 --> 2:27:38.940]  you're right you're going to live on french fry aisle or something right and your neighbors are
[2:27:38.940 --> 2:27:43.820]  going to but you're going to be like just this you know glob of a human this test tube gub gub
[2:27:43.820 --> 2:27:50.220]  snail man you know micro machines that constantly has to virtue signal like a chicken or a pigeon
[2:27:50.220 --> 2:27:54.940]  pecking the deal to get a piece of grain it's all just like a pat lovian ritual where you're in a
[2:27:54.940 --> 2:28:05.900]  box like that exactly yeah i mean um well i think what's what's really mind blowing is that it's not
[2:28:05.900 --> 2:28:10.780]  in one book it's in every one of their books well that's the thing is they all say the same thing
[2:28:10.780 --> 2:28:15.260]  that the wall street journal thinks saying dreaming of the end of humans or whatever the headline was
[2:28:15.260 --> 2:28:20.940]  it's the same weird thing it's unimaginative just like die roll over kill over your humanities
[2:28:20.940 --> 2:28:27.180]  only way you live is it's the same message die it's alien it's alien it's die humans die humans
[2:28:27.180 --> 2:28:31.900]  die humans die it's the same message over and over again yeah it's the entities that rise up
[2:28:31.900 --> 2:28:37.260]  it's the same spirit behind this right who does tim leary say is the father of this era he says
[2:28:37.260 --> 2:28:41.820]  crowley he says this in the introduction to he wrote the introduction he says ouser crowley
[2:28:41.820 --> 2:28:46.540]  and the talking to all the entities that is the spirit of our age let's talk about that
[2:28:46.540 --> 2:28:52.060]  with jay dyer straight ahead and the pedophilia coming out the religion of the evil and how we
[2:28:52.060 --> 2:28:58.060]  stop it attention gardeners if you need to grow nutritionally dense vegetables or medicinal herbs

[2:32:08.300 --> 2:32:15.580]  it is absurdist that Apple and Google and Nike have slave factories in China the worst on the
[2:32:15.580 --> 2:32:20.620]  planet and then a lecture white people in America how they're bad to black people and now all the
[2:32:20.620 --> 2:32:27.500]  world people are taking means trying to overthrow police and put leftist in control this is a totally
[2:32:27.500 --> 2:32:32.220]  sickening disgusting joke you ever heard the saying keep your friends close enemies closer
[2:32:32.860 --> 2:32:38.300]  leftists are evil and they divide and conquer people but at the heart of them is a eugenics-based
[2:32:38.860 --> 2:32:45.340]  depopulation operation why aren't black lives matter at cold springs harbour in new york
[2:32:45.340 --> 2:32:50.220]  where they run the whole operation trying to topple statues why aren't they at the united nations
[2:32:50.220 --> 2:32:54.380]  because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters
[2:32:58.220 --> 2:33:00.860]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:09.740 --> 2:33:15.260]  the globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end up on top
[2:33:15.260 --> 2:33:23.260]  the truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above them on our journey to hell
[2:33:25.420 --> 2:33:28.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:32.620 --> 2:33:34.780]  coming down fast but a miles above you

[2:36:56.380 --> 2:37:02.780]  because if you share that url we can't breathe dot news going back to j dire j big picture
[2:37:02.780 --> 2:37:11.820]  you've got alchemist magicians drug addicts cia alice or crawly heights who believe taking
[2:37:11.820 --> 2:37:17.500]  dmt and other drugs that they're interfacing with these demons that give them these plans
[2:37:17.500 --> 2:37:21.580]  whether this is some genetic remnant or a real spiritual communication regardless
[2:37:21.580 --> 2:37:26.460]  scientifically they're a death cult that's taken over your elaboration on that and and where you
[2:37:26.460 --> 2:37:30.300]  think it's going and how it's going for them and what you think they'll pull next and what they
[2:37:30.300 --> 2:37:33.820]  would do with that control means whatever you want to talk about you're a smart guy when i hear from
[2:37:33.820 --> 2:37:40.060]  you well it goes back to playdough right so if we look back to playdough's republic and we look
[2:37:40.060 --> 2:37:44.780]  at what the ancient philosophers said that's actually an elitist manual for how to govern
[2:37:44.780 --> 2:37:50.140]  and run society right playdough and the greeks invented this idea not just a eugenia of eugenic
[2:37:50.140 --> 2:37:56.300]  regimentation but also the idea of communism right the idea of the guardian class which is at the
[2:37:56.300 --> 2:38:02.060]  middle of that platonic period or a pyramid that guardian class has everything in common right and
[2:38:02.060 --> 2:38:06.700]  they can pretty much do whatever they want to with the lower proletarian you know slave class
[2:38:07.740 --> 2:38:13.340]  and so there's a strict view that everything has to be quantified mathematically and regimented
[2:38:13.340 --> 2:38:19.020]  and controlled that's the origin of technocracy of quantification fast forward all the way up to
[2:38:19.020 --> 2:38:23.100]  malphys and all those characters the galtons the wedges woods you know you read all those people
[2:38:23.100 --> 2:38:29.340]  and they're just saying look we need to use this model to govern and control society right
[2:38:29.340 --> 2:38:34.220]  and so they give everybody these false paradigms these false worldviews these overlays that are
[2:38:34.220 --> 2:38:39.900]  synthetic these fake worldviews meanwhile they sit back as this kind of scientific priest class which
[2:38:39.900 --> 2:38:45.500]  again leery uh jose delgado they all talk about themselves as the priest class in fact uh i was
[2:38:45.500 --> 2:38:50.380]  reading uh jonah sock the other day the hero that we all things the hero right did you know
[2:38:50.380 --> 2:38:56.380]  jonah sock wrote a book called survival of the wisest where he says that the elite priest class
[2:38:56.380 --> 2:39:01.980]  have to step up to the to the to the picture to the table and commandeer evolution this is what
[2:39:01.980 --> 2:39:06.620]  they all say they say we have to commandeer evolution to control where the species goes and
[2:39:06.620 --> 2:39:12.380]  that will include mass experimentation on the human population right he says that yeah exactly and
[2:39:12.380 --> 2:39:17.420]  that so the survival the wisest that he's talking about there are the smart ones that leery talks
[2:39:17.420 --> 2:39:22.220]  about who are the scientific priest class and by the way let's talk about just one little data point
[2:39:22.220 --> 2:39:28.700]  that's like the thread on the sweater gates gets up and all these people says if we give an old lady
[2:39:28.700 --> 2:39:34.620]  cancer treatment when she's 80 we got to fire 10 teachers well if you know about the economy the more
[2:39:34.620 --> 2:39:40.140]  service you give the deeper the economy and the more jobs once you say someone loses for you to gain
[2:39:40.700 --> 2:39:45.020]  that's not a renaissance economy that's a conquest economy that those actually implode
[2:39:45.020 --> 2:39:50.060]  more service more love more altruism builds a better society but the very liberals that say
[2:39:50.060 --> 2:39:55.980]  they want to give free stuff say kill an old lady you get 10 jobs no you're making yourself
[2:39:55.980 --> 2:40:01.020]  worthless too they've already got robots ready for that so just the the mathematics gates says
[2:40:01.020 --> 2:40:06.780]  of yeah oh we kill an old lady how is killing an old lady higher taking the hiring teachers
[2:40:06.780 --> 2:40:15.260]  yeah it's not mathematics it's just a fraud he puts out yeah it's just it's just made up right
[2:40:15.260 --> 2:40:19.100]  well we get those numbers down and then i can if we have less people then i'll have more new
[2:40:19.100 --> 2:40:23.100]  balance sneakers that i can wear uh and everybody will work and he just wants the power to kill but
[2:40:23.100 --> 2:40:27.900]  i mean that's what i'm saying exactly he just states things that are never even true he goes
[2:40:27.900 --> 2:40:32.220]  it's like saying well we need the science thought she says americans don't trust science
[2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:37.420]  or authority well you lied about everything about covid why would i listen to someone i go buy a car
[2:40:37.420 --> 2:40:41.980]  and they say it's brand new and it burns up on the highway five minutes later i buy another one
[2:40:41.980 --> 2:40:47.820]  it breaks in a week you're a liar it's not quote i can't handle science i can't handle
[2:40:47.820 --> 2:40:54.140]  handle psychotic liars yeah it's a humiliation ritual right this is the Maoist element of this
[2:40:54.140 --> 2:40:59.020]  so the the youth revolution they would do these humiliation rituals that's what we're that's what
[2:40:59.020 --> 2:41:04.060]  they're doing here is co-opting gen z make them into this Maoist revolutionary youth brigade
[2:41:04.060 --> 2:41:08.620]  and they're all totally at the best of the fortune 100 i mean imagine thinking that you're fighting
[2:41:08.620 --> 2:41:12.860]  the system when the entire corporate establishment is giving hundreds of millions of dollars to what
[2:41:12.860 --> 2:41:17.260]  you're doing by the way go back to that video of Fauci with the guy in the clown outfit all acting
[2:41:17.260 --> 2:41:22.700]  official and male and powerful but they're all just yes men go back to that footage so so who's
[2:41:22.700 --> 2:41:30.540]  on top of this j well you have of course according to quigley the bank for national settlements those
[2:41:30.540 --> 2:41:35.660]  powerful banking families and empires at the tip top and then you've got under them this sort of
[2:41:35.660 --> 2:41:40.220]  the way the anglo-american establishment by quigley describes it is the society of helpers
[2:41:40.220 --> 2:41:46.460]  right these are the 6000 you know roth cop book you know the 6000 managerial class of the super
[2:41:46.460 --> 2:41:51.420]  class it's you know the academic idiots who think that they're into this and that they're
[2:41:51.420 --> 2:41:56.460]  going to actually help things and you know they buy into the bs basically all of these professors
[2:41:56.460 --> 2:42:01.180]  i mean i had just the worst experience in college with these professors right but they all believe
[2:42:01.180 --> 2:42:04.700]  it right they believe their own bs they think that they're going to be part of this elite class
[2:42:04.700 --> 2:42:08.140]  and that they're going to fix everything and they don't realize that of course the elite
[2:42:08.140 --> 2:42:12.300]  helper class the first ones to get eliminated right in any of these Stalinist type revolutions
[2:42:12.300 --> 2:42:16.940]  right um and and it's it's funny because you read hg wills re birch and ross so they all laugh
[2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:20.780]  about this they all talk about they're like well you know obviously the traders to the existing
[2:42:20.780 --> 2:42:25.900]  people that's who we eliminate first right because how can the how can the coming regime you know
[2:42:25.900 --> 2:42:30.860]  trust the traders right so that's the irony of the whole like you know so yeah i'm not bragging
[2:42:30.860 --> 2:42:35.180]  about this but i've had the global seven tried in like seven eight years literally try to hire me
[2:42:35.180 --> 2:42:40.220]  because they know if i joined them i'd really join like like if i if you joined them i'm sure you'd
[2:42:40.220 --> 2:42:45.980]  actually do it with their people they're all backstabbers like what must that be like to be
[2:42:45.980 --> 2:42:51.500]  around people always jockeying for a better position it just sounds like a nightmare we're right back

[2:44:08.300 --> 2:44:17.500]  that they've orchestrated this by design if there's a mass awakening it can be their unraveling
[2:44:18.220 --> 2:44:22.780]  their destruction and then going down the drain the bible tells us that many times
[2:44:22.780 --> 2:44:28.700]  when the enemy digs a pit for us they themselves fall into it but god is the master of the universe
[2:44:28.700 --> 2:44:34.060]  but gives us free will and this plan is a test it is up to us to decide whether we're going down the
[2:44:34.060 --> 2:44:39.740]  drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain i cannot express the listeners and

[2:48:10.940 --> 2:48:16.540]  19 but uh really we should be resourcing because this i see uh is their fault
[2:48:19.820 --> 2:48:24.380]  a lot of my research on psychological warfare in hollywood and i didn't realize how much of a
[2:48:24.380 --> 2:48:28.860]  close connection there was between those two i've heard these rumors for many many years of
[2:48:28.860 --> 2:48:33.420]  oen flaming you know he worked with office of naval or his the british royal navy he was a
[2:48:33.420 --> 2:48:38.460]  syops this guy and all this so i went and did my masters on that and come to find out pretty
[2:48:38.460 --> 2:48:43.500]  much everything that you see in say the bond stories is i mean it's hollywood it up but it's
[2:48:43.500 --> 2:48:48.380]  kind of true there's elements of truth there we mentioned moon raker before but a lot of these
[2:48:48.380 --> 2:48:54.220]  other operations were from ian flaming's own experiences he saw this stuff right um and so
[2:48:54.780 --> 2:48:59.180]  yeah i think that that's one of the key ways to understand the close connection between
[2:48:59.180 --> 2:49:03.260]  hollywood and the intelligence agencies for many many years there's liaison offices right we all
[2:49:03.260 --> 2:49:09.740]  know this but it's much deeper than we think and now that epsi has has come out now that we you
[2:49:09.740 --> 2:49:15.100]  know can reflect on what cubrick said for example in eyes wide shut we realized that that was all
[2:49:15.100 --> 2:49:20.860]  real right the eyes wide shut stuff wasn't uh you know so by the way again i'm not bragging about
[2:49:20.860 --> 2:49:25.340]  this i i met with for like three days with his daughter she was on record to be his main protege
[2:49:25.340 --> 2:49:31.260]  the only one he trusted she laid out she said no no this is all real yeah yeah exactly i mean
[2:49:31.260 --> 2:49:36.220]  cubricks has this theme of the the pedo cults and all this stuff through most of his films right
[2:49:36.220 --> 2:49:41.980]  you go back to lolita go back to the shining where you know danie has been essentially molested by
[2:49:41.980 --> 2:49:46.060]  the jack knuckleson character right i mean this is a theme throughout cubrick i think he was always
[2:49:46.060 --> 2:49:50.460]  trying to tell us that this is how the elite entrap people this is how they get blackmail this is
[2:49:50.460 --> 2:49:55.500]  what they do this is how the whole system works it's a giant blackmail scam operation and many
[2:49:55.500 --> 2:50:00.060]  books have come out uh actually vindicating that former madams right used to have the dc madamon
[2:50:00.060 --> 2:50:04.700]  right so you know about this a long time ago uh now it's all just out in the open it's it's clear
[2:50:04.700 --> 2:50:07.980]  for everybody externalization the hierarchy everybody can look and see what's going on
[2:50:09.260 --> 2:50:13.340]  so so what do you expect them to do next and how do you think it's going for them
[2:50:14.940 --> 2:50:18.620]  well it's going to depend on what happens election wise i think we're gonna have to wait and see
[2:50:18.620 --> 2:50:24.380]  whether they can destroy the election uh happening right destroy the possibility of that that's what
[2:50:24.380 --> 2:50:28.700]  all this stuff is in the immediate intent that to do right is to get people to not vote get people
[2:50:28.700 --> 2:50:35.260]  to not look at uh what trump's doing to have this coup to do whatever they can that's necessary right
[2:50:35.260 --> 2:50:40.700]  it could get really crazy i expected to in the next few months um and but i would say that even after
[2:50:40.700 --> 2:50:47.420]  that uh the election time they're going to continue with oh nothing lets up let's talk about that if
[2:50:47.420 --> 2:50:54.620]  trump loses obviously biden is a placeholder who are they planning to insert i think you were right
[2:50:54.620 --> 2:50:59.260]  that it's going to be a hillary obama thing somehow right that's that's got to be in the cards
[2:50:59.260 --> 2:51:04.300]  who else could could they have right there's no other candidates or people that could even uh
[2:51:04.300 --> 2:51:09.180]  marshal enough support i mean i think trump is still really popular so they have to find these
[2:51:09.180 --> 2:51:13.900]  kind of placeholders like you said um so i think that if that happens it'll it'll it'll
[2:51:14.540 --> 2:51:19.500]  further agitate the uh opposition exactly no one wants to actually go up against trump the secret
[2:51:19.500 --> 2:51:24.140]  is a real personality he'll flamethrow him but if you put a zombie up trump doesn't know how to
[2:51:24.140 --> 2:51:31.020]  deal with a zombie he even says it so it's very sophisticated alchemical rituals they're doing
[2:51:32.620 --> 2:51:37.340]  absolutely again the alchemy is always mentioned again whether it's arthur kessler
[2:51:37.340 --> 2:51:41.100]  or whether it's a free tough copra whether anything's global elite they will actually
[2:51:41.100 --> 2:51:45.420]  talk about alchemy in their books yeah trouble rise against a real challenger but if you're a
[2:51:45.420 --> 2:51:50.700]  gladiator you enter the arena there's a corpse he's like the public's like where's the fight
[2:51:50.700 --> 2:51:56.940]  because he's fighting a corpse people think biden's weakness is strength no folks it's beyond
[2:51:56.940 --> 2:52:03.660]  strength it's victory for them he's like a muppet character from uh with like with a robot muppet
[2:52:03.660 --> 2:52:08.540]  character who like has a virus or something and he fumbles the words i don't know but oh i'm gonna
[2:52:08.540 --> 2:52:14.460]  watch random live feeds he can't string one sentence together did you see his youtube ad i mean he
[2:52:14.460 --> 2:52:20.620]  he fumbles in the youtube ad he's not this morning he's like i really need your help today he said trump
[2:52:20.620 --> 2:52:28.860]  bad i saw the black kids they were cockroaches i mean it's like what
[2:52:31.260 --> 2:52:36.940]  yeah i mean this is the irony is that that uh this this class of this political class they are are
[2:52:36.940 --> 2:52:42.620]  intensely racially minded right they in continue this whole racial attitude uh and so they want to
[2:52:42.620 --> 2:52:47.740]  actually damage the population as a whole especially the black population and so that's it because
[2:52:47.740 --> 2:52:52.620]  they're the elitists so they have to like have a group they enslave that's why they love homeless
[2:52:52.620 --> 2:52:57.180]  and all that it's like to them to see a bunch of people in bat let's see us with swimming pools
[2:52:57.180 --> 2:53:02.540]  and jet airplanes and and and look at me the elitists hate going to a club and seeing commoners
[2:53:02.540 --> 2:53:09.740]  with hot wives hot husbands they they just genuinely are pissed by success yeah i mean who
[2:53:09.740 --> 2:53:13.900]  would have who could have guessed that what they would bring is the religion of we was kings right
[2:53:13.900 --> 2:53:17.740]  i don't know if you know about this whole but the whole bracket like he was israelite all this
[2:53:17.740 --> 2:53:24.220]  cults it's a cult it's a crazy cult just like the cia and other groups have studied for years
[2:53:24.220 --> 2:53:30.860]  through ethnography cults indigenous religions how do we tailor these fake religions to roll out
[2:53:30.860 --> 2:53:35.340]  new cults to bring well get into what you just mentioned because there's all sorts of weird
[2:53:35.340 --> 2:53:41.420]  sabbatans and weird cults of the vatican and weird there's cults everywhere so what were you getting
[2:53:41.420 --> 2:53:48.140]  at just that that these are the perfect mechanisms for social engineering and for bringing in new
[2:53:48.140 --> 2:53:53.180]  plans or new i mean experimenting there's a lot of different uses for cults but i mean why do you
[2:53:53.180 --> 2:53:57.820]  think hollywood is so full of cults right cabalistic cults new age cult i mean hollywood is just one
[2:53:57.820 --> 2:54:04.940]  big cult basically right i mean so they're test labs and the cia has studied this for for years
[2:54:04.940 --> 2:54:11.100]  right it's called ethnography they would actually bring in anthropologists undercover did you know
[2:54:11.100 --> 2:54:16.380]  by the way indiana jones i was watching your funny clip about you as any on jones in the script
[2:54:16.380 --> 2:54:22.060]  indiana jones has said to be part of the os s he's actually an os s operative he's he's undercover
[2:54:22.060 --> 2:54:26.860]  anthropologist and so the cia actually did that right they would take these anthropologists
[2:54:26.860 --> 2:54:31.820]  and they would go and they would study cultures in order to figure out every little note every
[2:54:31.820 --> 2:54:36.620]  weak point every tension point and exacerbate that that's exactly what they're doing in the
[2:54:36.620 --> 2:54:41.580]  uo that's exactly what the race war is they admit that i mean that's in the wiki leaks that
[2:54:41.580 --> 2:54:45.500]  hillary's talking to the head of the university cycle psychological and she goes what do we do
[2:54:45.500 --> 2:54:51.020]  they go it's more culture war and that's all this is yeah man welcome to the manson dimension
[2:54:51.020 --> 2:54:56.860]  exactly now i agree with you that's very profound what you said because manson worked for the cia
[2:54:56.860 --> 2:55:01.180]  it's come out he was putting out drugs for mind control operation that's been confirmed
[2:55:01.180 --> 2:55:06.300]  he wasn't in the cia but he worked for him and they burned him but he was a beta test
[2:55:06.300 --> 2:55:11.980]  of a race war they were looking at then and now they're looking at it now yeah so they'll
[2:55:11.980 --> 2:55:16.940]  run these models and these tests and so what we're looking at now it's almost like a combination of
[2:55:16.940 --> 2:55:24.060]  color revolution n e d open society funded stuff mixed with the manson experiment test tube thing
[2:55:24.060 --> 2:55:29.100]  mixed with black uh you know we was kangs black live matter he was realized that they're so they're
[2:55:29.100 --> 2:55:34.060]  rolling out all this stuff at once because all of those things in my view even jonestown i think
[2:55:34.060 --> 2:55:38.860]  you could look at jonestown as another example of this jonestown is a similar pattern oh that
[2:55:38.860 --> 2:55:46.300]  was cia admittedly yep exactly it's declassified that was a test so instead of just turning humanity
[2:55:46.300 --> 2:55:51.420]  loose and and going because people just want victory they want competitiveness they want men
[2:55:51.420 --> 2:55:56.460]  and women they want families i mean the truth is we just want normalcy they're injecting a virus
[2:55:56.460 --> 2:56:02.860]  constantly trying to sabotage that the truth is we just come together without them they're there to
[2:56:02.860 --> 2:56:10.380]  create the division absolutely you exacerbate any tension areas right blow it up into something
[2:56:10.380 --> 2:56:15.660]  that's not even really a problem right you look at the statistics but that's the model of how you
[2:56:15.660 --> 2:56:21.020]  do the balkanization right i mean the the arc of crisis model for example brzezinski what he did was
[2:56:21.020 --> 2:56:27.420]  in the former soviet bloc he just exacerbated any possible tensions in the the former soviet bloc
[2:56:27.420 --> 2:56:33.660]  and that helped defeat you know the the remaining soviet satellites in the cold war that technology
[2:56:33.660 --> 2:56:38.300]  of micro nations balkanization i think is what they're rolling out so i think that in the long
[2:56:38.300 --> 2:56:43.260]  term they'd actually like to balkanize the us and split it up into who knows what
[2:56:46.140 --> 2:56:50.620]  exactly they admit world government isn't about unification it's about balkanization
[2:56:50.620 --> 2:56:54.220]  well j i've seen your work before i'm really impressed with you coming on this day

[2:57:26.540 --> 2:57:30.940]  should or they'll pay dearly for not supporting all right jay dyer thank you so much thank you
[2:57:30.940 --> 2:57:35.500]  we'll talk to you soon paul joseph watson's coming up i've got some key announcements right ahead
[2:57:35.500 --> 2:57:44.940]  stay with us on this june 23rd tuesday transmission
[2:57:44.940 --> 2:57:50.460]  the united states is not communist china we don't have three million people in concentration camps
[2:57:50.460 --> 2:57:56.300]  we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs but all over the
[2:57:56.300 --> 2:58:04.140]  news we see un available indicates who mainstream corporate media raising communist china for their
[2:58:04.140 --> 2:58:08.940]  response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses
[2:58:08.940 --> 2:58:13.820]  and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like
[2:58:13.820 --> 2:58:19.580]  san Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now qualmo in new york's
[2:58:19.580 --> 2:58:25.340]  calling it the european virus these people are out of control control freaks and they are going to
[2:58:25.340 --> 2:58:30.460]  lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them
[2:58:30.460 --> 2:58:36.460]  in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot video and info wars dot com spread those
[2:58:36.460 --> 2:58:41.420]  links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much
[2:58:41.420 --> 2:58:49.420]  quicker i was talking to my patriot supplier great suppliers you can now say four weeks on average
[2:58:49.420 --> 2:58:55.580]  for storable food it's the highest quality they've got it use this little rest we have caught in the
[2:58:55.580 --> 2:59:00.060]  current to come up to the surface get some air before you get sucked back down i personally am
[2:59:00.060 --> 2:59:05.500]  ordering more storeable food i have to now start going into defense posture 80 percent's offense
[2:59:05.500 --> 2:59:10.140]  but i've always been 100 percent offense trying to fully you know stop the globalists and we've
[2:59:10.140 --> 2:59:15.340]  given them a good run and i think down the road they'll be defeated but we are going to still go
[2:59:15.340 --> 2:59:21.100]  down the hard road now there were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down but uh we've mitigated some
[2:59:21.100 --> 2:59:24.780]  of this but it's it's still gonna be bad my view you need to get high quality storeable food it's
[2:59:24.780 --> 2:59:29.180]  something you need we have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast
[2:59:29.180 --> 2:59:34.780]  and 360 wins so please take care of your storeable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders
[2:59:34.780 --> 2:59:40.220]  in now so you get it so you have it some great containers high quality last 25 years get it
[2:59:40.220 --> 2:59:43.740]  while you can because if you think things are about to let up you ain't seen nothing yet
[2:59:43.740 --> 2:59:53.740]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:04.460 --> 3:00:07.980]  all right folks we are back live broadcasting or a live call
[3:00:07.980 --> 3:00:15.420]  all joseph watson's about to take over from the uk but i wanted to talk about roger stone
[3:00:15.420 --> 3:00:19.340]  coming up in like seven eight days next tuesday he reports to federal
[3:00:19.900 --> 3:00:24.460]  prison so let's put up on screen for folks uh the fact that this is a death sentence if you
[3:00:24.460 --> 3:00:29.500]  believe the government story that covid's killing everyone they've released all these criminals
[3:00:29.500 --> 3:00:35.020]  for massive crimes but not roger stone in fact i was shocked to learn that attorney general bill
[3:00:35.020 --> 3:00:41.100]  bars directed to the u.s. bureau of prisons than inmates that were convicted of nonviolent crimes
[3:00:41.100 --> 3:00:48.140]  be transferred from prison to home confinement applies to democrat super lawyer criminal michael
[3:00:48.140 --> 3:00:56.780]  avinani who stole 25 million from his clients from former prompt lawyer michael cohen who pled guilty
[3:00:56.780 --> 3:01:06.140]  to fraud and tax tax evasion and became a witness formula and rick gauge the former partner of
[3:01:06.140 --> 3:01:11.980]  paul manifold who became a witness formula in the trial against roger stone where he perjured
[3:01:11.980 --> 3:01:20.940]  himself but it does not apply to roger stone i have been absolutely shocked by the fact that
[3:01:20.940 --> 3:01:28.140]  roger stone is ordered a report to a coronavirus infested prison in rural georgia on june 30th
[3:01:28.140 --> 3:01:34.700]  at 67 years old which is a death sentence with asthma uh and if you believe in the whole covid
[3:01:34.700 --> 3:01:42.220]  thing tomorrow roger will file an emergency this is exclusive motion before a judge amy berman jackson
[3:01:42.780 --> 3:01:49.420]  requesting an extension in his surrender time based on current condition and the very real
[3:01:49.420 --> 3:01:56.300]  prospect of contracting covid 19 the facility i am designed and designated to go to in the event
[3:01:56.300 --> 3:02:04.300]  that judge jackson denies the request by stone he will have exhausted all his legal remedies it is at
[3:02:04.300 --> 3:02:09.660]  that time that the president really should commute roger stone's sentence on humanitarian grounds
[3:02:10.700 --> 3:02:17.340]  and that's what i got from sorts is very close to roger not from roger so there we are eight days
[3:02:17.340 --> 3:02:26.780]  countdown to death sentence for roger stone but you hear what i said harvey weinstein
[3:02:29.740 --> 3:02:38.620]  trumps former lawyer cohen avanade all these incredibly bad guys they get released from
[3:02:38.620 --> 3:02:45.340]  prison for convictions for rape embezzlement fraud it's all a okay but roger stone they say
[3:02:45.340 --> 3:02:57.980]  lied to congress lied to congress about talking to wiki leaks what he didn't even say he talked
[3:02:57.980 --> 3:03:04.540]  to wiki leaks said he talked to someone that knew wiki leaks it's insane but it's the climate we're
[3:03:04.540 --> 3:03:10.220]  in right now ladies and gentlemen it's where this country has gone but it's okay because aoc says she's
[3:03:10.220 --> 3:03:19.100]  black major announcement aoc declares latinos are black and she's releasing a photo of herself
[3:03:19.100 --> 3:03:24.940]  ladies and gentlemen so you can't question her or your anti-black meanwhile the democratic party
[3:03:25.740 --> 3:03:30.700]  spends all its time trying to abort and kill as many blacks as they can keep your friends
[3:03:30.700 --> 3:03:36.460]  close your enemies closer yet i'm not going to give black folks any platitude to kiss your ass
[3:03:36.460 --> 3:03:43.420]  but i'm not a virtue signaling trendy trying to kill you and these people make me say
[3:03:44.540 --> 3:03:50.300]  tell me like if i got up here on air with a afro in my head and i said i'm black now listen to me
[3:03:50.300 --> 3:03:57.660]  i'm trendy you laugh at me but when these leftists do it it's so cute it's so funny all their pr firms
[3:03:57.660 --> 3:04:02.300]  trying to trick as many people as they can but the good news is hollywood's collapsing their whole

[3:06:13.420 --> 3:06:19.980]  with the aid of every major cultural institution hollywood every legacy media outlet silicon valley
[3:06:19.980 --> 3:06:24.780]  and basically every major corporation we're not going to start with that for a change we are going
[3:06:24.780 --> 3:06:31.980]  to get into that later but we're actually going to start with some good news yes some actual good
[3:06:31.980 --> 3:06:36.940]  news on the subject of social media censorship because we've had the revelations today of course
[3:06:36.940 --> 3:06:44.460]  out of project veritas regarding more facebook bias regarding more flagrant lies in terms of
[3:06:44.460 --> 3:06:49.180]  zuckerberg getting up in front of ted cruise and saying that there's no political bias at facebook
[3:06:49.180 --> 3:06:56.380]  evidence in triplicate once again that yes there is but we have some good news on the social media
[3:06:56.380 --> 3:07:00.780]  front you know people always say well why not just build your own social media network like when
[3:07:00.780 --> 3:07:06.300]  people get deplatformed by banks why not just build your own bank well someone actually did
[3:07:06.300 --> 3:07:13.500]  that and the media the legacy media at least is starting to get a little anxious a little nervous
[3:07:14.220 --> 3:07:20.380]  about the growth of this one particular network which is called parlor or parley if you're using
[3:07:20.380 --> 3:07:26.860]  the french term headline media demonization of parlor begins after free speech network attracts
[3:07:26.860 --> 3:07:33.820]  a lot of new users and i noticed about a week ago that the engagement i was getting on parlor
[3:07:33.820 --> 3:07:40.860]  on some posts was actually greater than the post i was you know simulating on twitter the same
[3:07:40.860 --> 3:07:46.780]  post they had a flood of users last year after the saudi arabian government started censoring
[3:07:46.780 --> 3:07:52.380]  its citizens on twitter with twitter's complicity of course who then all flooded over to parlor
[3:07:52.940 --> 3:08:00.780]  and at that point mid 2019 apple and the other app stores google play suddenly started to have
[3:08:00.780 --> 3:08:06.060]  a problem with parlor and suddenly started to claim that they were hosting offensive content
[3:08:06.060 --> 3:08:11.580]  now of course twitter and facebook can host offensive content all day long facebook could
[3:08:11.580 --> 3:08:17.100]  literally have mass shooters live streaming their massacres on facebook like in the case of the
[3:08:17.100 --> 3:08:23.660]  new zealand mosque shooter like in the case of the guy who shot the two news reporters live on air
[3:08:23.660 --> 3:08:28.380]  both of those massacres live streamed on facebook that's not a problem that's not going to get
[3:08:28.380 --> 3:08:35.900]  facebook taken off the google play store app or the apple store app no but because parlor
[3:08:35.900 --> 3:08:41.420]  had a few edgy posts a few offensive posts which they forgot to delete or didn't have the moderators
[3:08:41.420 --> 3:08:48.540]  at the time to delete apple began threatening to kick them off the app store treating them as a
[3:08:48.540 --> 3:08:55.260]  publisher and not a platform of course twitter and facebook gets treated as platforms so they're
[3:08:55.260 --> 3:09:00.540]  not responsible for anything posted on their website but as soon as you get an alternate
[3:09:00.540 --> 3:09:05.820]  alt tech platform that actually supports free speech then they suddenly become a publisher
[3:09:05.820 --> 3:09:11.100]  and they're responsible for everything posted on their website but now in an entirely expected
[3:09:11.100 --> 3:09:17.420]  development in fact i considered tweeting oh parlor is getting really popular watch out for
[3:09:17.420 --> 3:09:23.980]  media demonization hit pieces within a week and it actually happened within 24 hours media hit
[3:09:23.980 --> 3:09:29.020]  pieces against pro free speech social network parlor began after the site attracted a ton of
[3:09:29.020 --> 3:09:34.620]  new followers now there's a lot of people on twitter on the left which of course is a leftist
[3:09:34.620 --> 3:09:40.460]  echo chamber and that's fine for that to be a leftist echo chamber but when an organization
[3:09:40.460 --> 3:09:44.940]  that springs out of the maga movement conservative movement does the same thing oh it's terrible
[3:09:44.940 --> 3:09:50.940]  that it's a right-wing echo chamber even though twitter has now literally become a platform
[3:09:50.940 --> 3:09:57.020]  for far left extremists to mob docks and harass conservatives en masse we're going to get into
[3:09:57.020 --> 3:10:02.540]  that later as well but if people on parlor just want to have a conversation with each other
[3:10:02.540 --> 3:10:07.580]  and generally agree with each other that's terrible that's horrific and they don't really know how to
[3:10:07.580 --> 3:10:11.420]  handle it there are some people on twitter on the left who say just let them get on with it
[3:10:12.300 --> 3:10:17.260]  let them have this twigs it as they're calling it let them all go over to parlor and have their
[3:10:17.260 --> 3:10:22.300]  little echo chamber others are calling for it to be banned and it almost was banned last year on
[3:10:22.300 --> 3:10:28.860]  apple store so we'll see if that happens again but the article continues the website's engagement
[3:10:28.860 --> 3:10:34.060]  levels have skyrocketed in recent weeks as many more people choose to transition away from twitter
[3:10:34.060 --> 3:10:38.540]  which has become a cesspit of censorship and a platform for far left-wing extremists to engage
[3:10:38.540 --> 3:10:44.300]  in the mob harassment and docksing of conservatives which they allow by the way on a daily basis and
[3:10:44.300 --> 3:10:49.980]  do nothing whatsoever to stop it despite it being a direct violation of their own terms of service
[3:10:50.780 --> 3:10:55.820]  numerous members of congress in the united states and conservative mps in the uk have
[3:10:55.820 --> 3:11:00.620]  also started signing up to the network prompting anxiety among silicon valley that parlor could
[3:11:00.620 --> 3:11:06.060]  eventually become a genuine competitor now the one thing that needs to happen which i make the
[3:11:06.060 --> 3:11:11.980]  point at the end of this article donald trump himself needs to sign up for parlor he's not on
[3:11:11.980 --> 3:11:18.140]  there i think don jr is on there eric trumps on there trump needs to sign up to parlor and he needs
[3:11:18.140 --> 3:11:26.300]  to post parlays as they call them posts exclusively to parlor ones which are not on twitter because
[3:11:26.300 --> 3:11:31.500]  of course that will then force the mainstream media and all the leftists who hyperventilate on a
[3:11:31.500 --> 3:11:37.820]  daily basis about every single word that trump tweets over to parlor and that's a good thing
[3:11:37.820 --> 3:11:43.100]  then they won't be able to claim it's an echo chamber then it will be forced into the mainstream
[3:11:43.100 --> 3:11:48.540]  trump needs to do that he should have done it last year hasn't happened yet he needs to do it now
[3:11:49.580 --> 3:11:54.060]  unlike twitter and facebook which have become notorious for banning users and removing content
[3:11:54.060 --> 3:12:00.060]  at the behest of organized left-wing mobs parlor's terms of service are in line with the fcc's
[3:12:00.060 --> 3:12:05.660]  definition of obscene content well how dare they which allows for offensive posts so long as they're
[3:12:05.660 --> 3:12:11.340]  of literary artistic political or scientific value this has panicked the mainstream media
[3:12:12.140 --> 3:12:16.380]  who of course have worked in concert with big tech of last year's to beat the platform prominent
[3:12:16.380 --> 3:12:22.540]  voices who dare to descend against the current takeover of society by woke radicals and boy has
[3:12:22.540 --> 3:12:30.060]  that escalated over the past month a hit piece in the uk independent tries to connect parlor to gab
[3:12:30.060 --> 3:12:36.300]  ab using guilt by association by suggesting gab was responsible for mass shootings so again because
[3:12:36.300 --> 3:12:43.580]  one individual back in i think it was november 2018 posted on gab before he carried out this
[3:12:43.580 --> 3:12:50.620]  mass shooting from that moment onwards gab became the platform of racist right-wing mass shooters
[3:12:51.340 --> 3:12:56.300]  of course they had their app called now they have visa withdrawing its services
[3:12:56.300 --> 3:13:03.820]  as well you can go on facebook as the new zealand mosque shooter and live stream it on that platform
[3:13:03.820 --> 3:13:09.340]  what's going to happen to facebook absolutely nothing so in this article they try to link
[3:13:09.340 --> 3:13:14.780]  parlor to gab despite the fact there's no connection whatsoever in terms of the founders the people
[3:13:14.780 --> 3:13:21.820]  who run it the story also quotes another sources claiming parlor is full of fury fear and conspiracy
[3:13:21.820 --> 3:13:27.580]  theories because there's no fury whatsoever on twitter is there there's not literal death threats
[3:13:27.580 --> 3:13:34.300]  and plots against trump on a daily basis there's not people being labeled caron hunted down and
[3:13:34.300 --> 3:13:39.660]  exposed and people contacting their employers people contacting their family members people
[3:13:39.660 --> 3:13:44.460]  ruining their lives over claims that didn't have no proof of even existing which we're going to get
[3:13:44.460 --> 3:13:50.780]  on to in a moment no there's no fury whatsoever on twitter it's a peaceful place for reasoned
[3:13:50.780 --> 3:13:57.500]  conversation while also suggesting the site is hotbed of kkk discussion because they found two
[3:13:57.500 --> 3:14:03.260]  posts referring to the late senator robert bird who of course was a democrat and a close friend of
[3:14:03.260 --> 3:14:08.220]  hillary clinton but that doesn't matter another hit piece in yahoo news expressed concern that rep
[3:14:08.940 --> 3:14:14.060]  devin newness republican of california touted the network says 1.1 million twitter followers
[3:14:14.060 --> 3:14:19.020]  again how dare he while also charging that the network is a conservative echo chamber apparently
[3:14:19.020 --> 3:14:25.020]  it's fine for twitter to be a far left echo chamber the story also complains many threads on
[3:14:25.020 --> 3:14:31.020]  parlor mock black lives matter protesters and we can't have that can we of course people being banned
[3:14:31.020 --> 3:14:36.060]  for that in place with twitter on a daily basis another twitter user in the uk is already trying
[3:14:36.060 --> 3:14:42.620]  to get parlor banned he's put up a petition on the uk parliament website for the uk government to
[3:14:42.620 --> 3:14:48.540]  ban parlor so far it's got five signatures good luck with that big tech is clearly frightened at
[3:14:48.540 --> 3:14:52.780]  parlor sudden growth there are also signs that leftists are creating accounts to combat conservative
[3:14:52.780 --> 3:14:59.180]  talking points which is a good thing as it will massively grow the user base so as i said before
[3:14:59.180 --> 3:15:04.300]  all we need to do is to have president trump start a parlor account and begin posting exclusive
[3:15:04.300 --> 3:15:10.060]  messages there that don't appear on twitter that will force everybody over this so-called executive
[3:15:10.060 --> 3:15:16.860]  order that was supposed to address big tech censorship was absolutely completely ceremonial
[3:15:16.860 --> 3:15:21.980]  did basically nothing now we have reports coming out over the past few days that president trump
[3:15:21.980 --> 3:15:28.780]  met secretly with mark zuckerberg and they struck some kind of deal where trump wouldn't openly
[3:15:28.780 --> 3:15:35.660]  criticize zuckerberg on twitter he would only go after twitter itself therefore allowing trump to
[3:15:35.660 --> 3:15:41.900]  maintain his presence on facebook where zuckerberg simply criticizes him doesn't remove or censor any
[3:15:41.900 --> 3:15:47.100]  of it any of trump's posts as twitter has done trump needs to get on parlor i'm going to get more
[3:15:47.100 --> 3:15:52.300]  into this on the other side of the break but it's great news summit dot news don't go away hi i'm

[3:19:55.500 --> 3:19:58.220]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:19:58.220 --> 3:20:13.740]  live from london england it's haul joseph watson with summit.news
[3:20:16.620 --> 3:20:22.860]  so parlor.com is emerging as potentially a long-term competitor to twitter obviously it's
[3:20:22.860 --> 3:20:29.580]  user bases far less than twitter at this moment but the kind of engagement i've seen on parlor
[3:20:29.580 --> 3:20:35.180]  of the past week is absolutely monumental and nothing like i've seen on any other alt tech
[3:20:35.180 --> 3:20:42.700]  platform ever in existence and now parlor is calling for twitter exit twig exit exodus in
[3:20:42.700 --> 3:20:47.900]  declaration of independence reports bright mark the free speech social media platform parlor is
[3:20:47.900 --> 3:20:53.260]  calling for twig exit a mass exodus of twitter users and it's recently issued tech declaration of
[3:20:53.260 --> 3:20:57.580]  independence and bill of rights in which it takes a stand against acts of censorship and
[3:20:57.580 --> 3:21:03.900]  data abuse by silicon valley giants like twitter and facebook i don't think people should just
[3:21:03.900 --> 3:21:08.220]  abandon the battlefield in terms of twitter i think they should remain on twitter and ride it
[3:21:08.220 --> 3:21:12.540]  until the wheels fall off you're probably going to get banned anyway at some point so you might as
[3:21:12.540 --> 3:21:17.180]  well stop stay on there until that point but definitely everyone needs to sign up i'm not
[3:21:17.180 --> 3:21:21.100]  getting paid to say this i'm not sponsored by parlor everyone needs to sign up there though
[3:21:21.100 --> 3:21:25.260]  because it really is making them nervous which is why you're seeing all these these hit pieces
[3:21:25.260 --> 3:21:31.340]  because god forbid we have competition god forbid we allow dissidents to express themselves on the
[3:21:31.340 --> 3:21:38.060]  internet right it's actually happening in greater and greater numbers on parlor.com and it's happening
[3:21:38.060 --> 3:21:44.860]  because of stories like this out of information liberation reddit starts banning users for their
[3:21:44.860 --> 3:21:50.780]  upvotes yeah it's not even for the posts anymore it's for the upvotes it's like you like someone's
[3:21:50.780 --> 3:21:56.300]  tweet on twitter in fact people are now being fired for following mike cernovich and jack
[3:21:56.300 --> 3:22:02.300]  persobeck on twitter it's not even the tweets anymore it's who you follow it's who you like
[3:22:03.020 --> 3:22:08.860]  retweets on endorsements doesn't matter anymore they are you're fired now konday nas reddit on sunday
[3:22:08.860 --> 3:22:15.100]  started issuing temp bans against users for upvoting wrong think the screenshot was shared
[3:22:15.100 --> 3:22:20.460]  by a user on watch reddit die a subreddit which chronicles reddit's aggressive censorship
[3:22:21.340 --> 3:22:26.300]  says your account has been suspended from reddit for breaking the rules you upvoted a post or
[3:22:26.300 --> 3:22:32.540]  comment that was determined to be against our policies they're now merely expressing support
[3:22:32.540 --> 3:22:39.180]  or highlighting a post in terms of an upvote not even saying anything is enough to get you banned
[3:22:39.180 --> 3:22:43.100]  reddit announced in february that users have consistently upvote policy breaking content
[3:22:43.100 --> 3:22:47.500]  within quarantine communities will receive automated warnings followed by further consequences
[3:22:47.500 --> 3:22:53.660]  like temporary or permanent suspension and that's exactly what's happening there was another post
[3:22:53.660 --> 3:23:00.940]  which was removed after getting 52 000 upvotes which said the fact that two weeks ago you were
[3:23:00.940 --> 3:23:05.980]  considered a selfish a-hole if you went out to socialize and now it's okay for thousands of people
[3:23:05.980 --> 3:23:12.060]  together shows you how much media controls the masses completely legitimate rational point
[3:23:12.700 --> 3:23:20.620]  no hatred against minorities nothing whatsoever 52 000 upvotes removed of course the donald subreddit
[3:23:21.500 --> 3:23:28.620]  was credited during the 2016 election as being one of the most influential places where memes
[3:23:28.620 --> 3:23:34.700]  were created and spread that actually the university studies into the most successful platforms for
[3:23:34.700 --> 3:23:41.260]  spreading conservative right-wing memes the two at the top of the list were paul fourchan and the
[3:23:41.260 --> 3:23:47.900]  donald subreddit of course what happened to the donald subreddit it got quarantined the posts which
[3:23:47.900 --> 3:23:53.820]  the moderators censored and deleted didn't matter it got quarantined so it got put into a you know
[3:23:53.820 --> 3:23:59.340]  a band that got put on the naughty step where you had to sign into an account to see anything
[3:23:59.340 --> 3:24:04.300]  it got restricted it got relegated in the algorithm now i don't think it even exists anymore last time
[3:24:04.300 --> 3:24:09.100]  i checked it wasn't there i think they started their own website to replace it but reddit is the
[3:24:09.100 --> 3:24:16.540]  worst of the worst they're also deleting videos which show people being assaulted in grocery stores
[3:24:16.540 --> 3:24:22.620]  of course you can post violent videos of antifa and blm radicals attacking white people all day
[3:24:22.620 --> 3:24:28.620]  long and it gets celebrated on twitter and it gets 300 000 likes that's fine you post a video
[3:24:28.620 --> 3:24:33.340]  of a white person being assaulted and let's face it there are a lot of those videos recently on
[3:24:33.340 --> 3:24:40.860]  there and it's gone it's deleted so now they're suspending banning people simply for upvoting
[3:24:40.860 --> 3:24:49.260]  things on reddit meanwhile we have this headline out of project out of the daily caller sorry we're
[3:24:49.260 --> 3:24:52.940]  going to go to that after because we got a click to play and we've only got four minutes left in
[3:24:52.940 --> 3:24:57.500]  this segment so i'm going to hold that over so we can get to the full clip but still on the
[3:24:57.500 --> 3:25:02.540]  subject of social media this is what i talked about with twitter twitter is not only a dumpster
[3:25:02.540 --> 3:25:08.700]  fire of censorship it's now a platform for criminals to brag about their criminal and
[3:25:08.700 --> 3:25:13.340]  violent behavior as we've seen over the past four weeks and to organize that violent criminal
[3:25:13.340 --> 3:25:21.740]  behavior and it's a platform to organize the mass mob harassment and doxing of quote conservatives
[3:25:21.740 --> 3:25:30.540]  or indeed anyone not even political in this case headline out of gateway pundit anti-white activist
[3:25:30.540 --> 3:25:37.580]  follows terrified white woman film sir leftist celebrate harassment this video has got like
[3:25:37.580 --> 3:25:43.660]  five million views last time i checked again a flagrant violation of twitter's own terms of service
[3:25:43.660 --> 3:25:49.020]  where you can't organize the harassment the doxing of individuals they do it on a daily basis
[3:25:49.020 --> 3:25:54.700]  somebody posts a confrontation with a Karen of course this Karen meme has now become a conduit
[3:25:54.700 --> 3:26:01.580]  for people to just harass middle-aged white women started out in my mind as a kind of joke about
[3:26:01.580 --> 3:26:08.220]  people who are too controlling regarding coronavirus regarding the wearing of masks regarding social
[3:26:08.220 --> 3:26:13.500]  distancing and we still see a lot of that with people being caught on tape lecturing others
[3:26:13.500 --> 3:26:19.100]  about the not social distancing enough but the Karen meme has definitely mutated and now it's
[3:26:19.100 --> 3:26:24.460]  basically just another excuse to harass white people on the street not just harass them but
[3:26:24.460 --> 3:26:31.660]  then post the video on twitter socially shame them and organize a hate mob to harass and dox them
[3:26:31.660 --> 3:26:37.980]  we've seen this with children on tick tock teenagers trump supporting teenagers who make
[3:26:37.980 --> 3:26:44.780]  slightly edgy tick tock videos people record those videos download them post them on twitter
[3:26:44.780 --> 3:26:50.460]  then in the response thread it's literally hundreds of people bragging oh i've got his home address
[3:26:50.460 --> 3:26:55.180]  i've got his work address i've got his mother's the location of his mother's school where she
[3:26:55.180 --> 3:27:00.700]  works let's call them off let's go to the address completely criminal completely against twitter's
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:06.700]  terms of service they have a lexicon called twitter do your thing whenever they post one
[3:27:06.700 --> 3:27:12.860]  of these harassment videos twitter do your thing which is a dog whistle for hundreds if not thousands
[3:27:12.860 --> 3:27:18.700]  of people to organize in a kind of human intelligence gathering operation to find out where people
[3:27:18.700 --> 3:27:24.860]  live where they work where their family members live dox threaten harass them get them fired this
[3:27:24.860 --> 3:27:31.740]  happens on a daily basis twitter does nothing whatsoever it gets 250 000 300 000 likes the
[3:27:31.740 --> 3:27:37.420]  posts remain up now there's another example of that a seattle-based black lives matter activist
[3:27:38.140 --> 3:27:43.580]  with the twitter handle white people hate which stands for white people hate again very tolerant
[3:27:43.580 --> 3:27:48.780]  followed a terrified white woman home harassed her filmed her address and license plate and
[3:27:48.780 --> 3:27:53.580]  is attempting to ruin her life for some social media clout now in this video you'll see this
[3:27:53.580 --> 3:27:58.780]  woman is absolutely terrified she's screaming not because she thinks the dangerous black man
[3:27:58.780 --> 3:28:04.540]  is going to violently attack her that's not what's going on she's terrified and she says it numerous
[3:28:04.540 --> 3:28:09.340]  times because he's filming her license plate he's filming a house saying this is where she lives
[3:28:09.340 --> 3:28:15.660]  is claiming she called him the n-word but not in his original tweet he only claimed she called him
[3:28:15.660 --> 3:28:20.620]  the n-word when one of the neighbors came out and said why are you harassing this woman and then
[3:28:20.620 --> 3:28:26.220]  people went through his twitter history and found numerous examples where he claims people called
[3:28:26.220 --> 3:28:33.100]  him the n-word with no video evidence no tweets no proof whatsoever almost certainly made that
[3:28:33.100 --> 3:28:38.140]  claim up and now this woman's life is probably going to be ruined because a hate mob of millions of
[3:28:38.140 --> 3:28:43.340]  people have seen this video nowhere she lives they know where she works by now because it's all in
[3:28:43.340 --> 3:28:49.740]  the thread and now her life is ruined for what that's twitter that's what twitter's become don't go

[3:31:59.100 --> 3:32:07.180]  government believe they pulled the drain on america a long time ago but if we understand
[3:32:07.180 --> 3:32:12.700]  that they've orchestrated this by design and if there's a mass awakening
[3:32:14.540 --> 3:32:21.100]  it can be their unraveling their destruction and then going down the drain the bible tells us
[3:32:21.100 --> 3:32:26.940]  that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us they themselves fall into it but god is the master
[3:32:26.940 --> 3:32:32.220]  of the universe but gives us free will on this planet as a test it is up to us to decide whether
[3:32:32.220 --> 3:32:38.140]  we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain i cannot express the

[3:33:16.700 --> 3:33:23.420]  now we're going to get into the latest facebook revelations our project
[3:33:23.420 --> 3:33:29.740]  baritas just the final book note on that harassment video caron yet another caron there's one on a
[3:33:29.740 --> 3:33:36.220]  daily basis of course last week they harassed and bullied another caron who was a police officer
[3:33:36.220 --> 3:33:41.820]  who was merely expressing concern about how she thought her food might be poisoned in light of
[3:33:41.820 --> 3:33:50.060]  this atmosphere of rampant vitriolic hatred against cops she did a video sat in a police car saying
[3:33:50.060 --> 3:33:54.460]  she was concerned about her food being poisoned her life was utterly ruined she was publicly
[3:33:54.460 --> 3:33:59.420]  shamed by millions of people again twitter did nothing about that an addendum though is this
[3:33:59.420 --> 3:34:05.100]  carless dillard who harassed this other woman because she flipped him off because that's totally a
[3:34:05.100 --> 3:34:12.460]  reasonable punishment isn't it for flipping somebody off to ruin their lives forever to have
[3:34:12.460 --> 3:34:17.980]  people track them down get their home address get their license registration it's totally
[3:34:17.980 --> 3:34:25.260]  equitable isn't it this guy in a tit for tat move his employer postmates has now been contacted by
[3:34:25.260 --> 3:34:30.540]  people on twitter in fact postmates on their officially verified twitter account responded
[3:34:30.540 --> 3:34:34.780]  and said they're looking into it so again this is going to escalate you're going to get this
[3:34:34.780 --> 3:34:40.940]  tit for tat situation someone responded to this incident on twitter by saying if she didn't want
[3:34:40.940 --> 3:34:46.620]  to be followed home she shouldn't have been an s-h-i-t-t-y human being she could have easily
[3:34:46.620 --> 3:34:52.220]  rolled down a window waved and said have a wonderful day so because she flipped somebody off in a
[3:34:52.220 --> 3:34:58.460]  moment of anger and traffic her life needs to be ruined no mike sernovich responded today said if
[3:34:58.460 --> 3:35:04.460]  she didn't want to be followed home the far left is outright signing on to stalking and rate
[3:35:04.460 --> 3:35:11.020]  culture that's exactly what it is and it happens on twitter on a daily basis meanwhile on facebook
[3:35:11.580 --> 3:35:16.380]  daily caller reports project veritas video shows facebook content moderators discussing
[3:35:16.380 --> 3:35:21.580]  censoring conservatives reveals exception given to don lemon for hate speech and also by the way
[3:35:22.620 --> 3:35:25.660]  one moderator had quoted that she tweaked she treats
[3:35:26.380 --> 3:35:31.740]  trump supporters who wear mega hats as terrorists sounds very neutral non-partisan doesn't it
[3:35:31.740 --> 3:35:37.740]  as mark zuckerberg claimed the ted cruise during that hearing facebook content moderators discuss
[3:35:37.740 --> 3:35:41.900]  using their positions to censor republicans and conservatives in an undercover video released
[3:35:41.900 --> 3:35:46.620]  by activist group project veritas on tuesday we have it right now here it is
[3:35:51.500 --> 3:35:56.300]  you are you afraid i think the truth is more powerful than any nda
[3:35:56.300 --> 3:36:03.660]  um it's a very progressive company who's very anti-maga i think they're very biased with who
[3:36:03.660 --> 3:36:09.500]  they protect facebook kind of is yeah facebook is notorious for and they say they don't but
[3:36:09.500 --> 3:36:13.180]  it's clear that people's content don't come up because it's been defiltered off the queue
[3:36:14.140 --> 3:36:19.500]  they're doing something and they're just trying to pretend nothing to me censorship online is one
[3:36:19.500 --> 3:36:24.300]  of the biggest issues facing us in the lead up to the 2020 election let me run something by you
[3:36:24.300 --> 3:36:29.100]  you know that uh civic harassment queue that we've been in lately yeah it's just me or is it
[3:36:29.100 --> 3:36:35.260]  like all republicans in there so republicans but a lot of it comes off the trust page specific
[3:36:35.260 --> 3:36:42.140]  specifically so for 75 to 80 percent of the posts to be targeting republicans and conservatives
[3:36:42.140 --> 3:36:58.780]  you can say it was a bot but somebody had to design that algorithm so really somebody at facebook
[3:36:58.780 --> 3:37:13.580]  like if you see a conservative coach you just get rid of it right i don't give no i'll delete it
[3:37:14.220 --> 3:37:20.380]  we were told to leave this image up as long as it didn't say oh i'm going to actually kill
[3:37:20.380 --> 3:37:29.500]  donald trump or something like that so you've deleted just hashtag maga yeah like the post gone
[3:37:29.500 --> 3:37:32.540]  a lot of people are taking down uh you know
[3:37:48.460 --> 3:37:54.460]  how many of you are like take your own stance and say we're just deleting whatever all the all the
[3:37:54.460 --> 3:38:04.220]  trump and you guys they used to lead everyone i know that facebook does have a trump tool where
[3:38:04.220 --> 3:38:10.540]  they still allow him on the platform even though he says things that if anyone else said it and
[3:38:10.540 --> 3:38:15.900]  that's that's the fortunate thing is even if he does say something if it gets repeated we can at
[3:38:15.900 --> 3:38:26.300]  least get the average job at the time when i do people for like you should be on a watch list
[3:38:26.300 --> 3:38:32.700]  yeah seriously you know trump spores like to throw around like trump derangement syndrome
[3:38:32.700 --> 3:38:37.660]  yeah as like you know liberals being crazy i like it but is that actually you're the one that has
[3:38:37.660 --> 3:38:47.980]  a top ranger syndrome yeah you're losing your god damn mind because if you say 2020 yeah and it's like
[3:38:55.020 --> 3:38:59.420]  so you listen to that you listen to them saying people with maga hats were treated as terrorists
[3:38:59.420 --> 3:39:06.860]  they deleted pro trump posts at their own behest on a whim zhokovar got up in front of um a committee
[3:39:06.860 --> 3:39:13.740]  back in april 2018 and said facebook was trying to make sure that we don't have any bias in the work
[3:39:13.740 --> 3:39:19.020]  that we do does it really sound like they've made a lot of progress in over two years remember facebook
[3:39:19.900 --> 3:39:26.860]  put me on a list with drug cartels sex traffickers and serial killers and not only that
[3:39:26.860 --> 3:39:32.300]  they then told told their user base that it was okay to incite and plan violence against me
[3:39:32.300 --> 3:39:38.460]  because the people on that list were exempted from planning violence on their platform so
[3:39:38.460 --> 3:39:43.900]  they literally put out a fat war saying that it was okay to plan violence against me on facebook
[3:39:43.900 --> 3:39:49.980]  because they put me on a list with drug cartels sex traffickers and serial killers oh but it's
[3:39:49.980 --> 3:39:55.420]  non-bias because they had to remove that a couple of days later the fact that they even put it on
[3:39:55.420 --> 3:40:03.020]  there in the first place was absolutely chilling meanwhile rt reports noose in bubba wallace's
[3:40:03.020 --> 3:40:07.500]  garage may have been a benign pull rope twitter pundits argue showing video evidence and in fact
[3:40:07.500 --> 3:40:13.260]  we got a marked ice clip on this which we're going to roll here in a second of course this is the
[3:40:13.260 --> 3:40:19.260]  controversy over nazcar driver bubba wallace who claimed they'd found a noose in his garage
[3:40:19.260 --> 3:40:23.980]  that the noose purportedly hanging in nazcar driver bubba wallace's garage may have actually
[3:40:23.980 --> 3:40:28.460]  been a rope used to close the door of the carport internet sleuths have argued citing
[3:40:28.460 --> 3:40:34.300]  videos and photographs of the alleged crime let's see a more dice lay this out in this clip right
[3:40:34.300 --> 3:40:40.780]  now here it is i can't say with a hundred percent certainty at this point but i would give it a 99.9
[3:40:40.780 --> 3:40:49.500]  percent chance that the supposed noose found in the nazcar garage of bubba wallace was this garage
[3:40:49.500 --> 3:40:56.060]  pole shown on the official nazcar youtube channel during one of their garage cam walkthroughs of
[3:40:56.060 --> 3:41:03.660]  the talladega super speedway in alabama where bubba wallace's crew supposedly found the noose
[3:41:03.660 --> 3:41:09.420]  that somebody left in his garage the moment i first heard about the noose i figured it was
[3:41:09.420 --> 3:41:15.580]  just an extension cord coiled up and hung on the wall or a air compressor hose or a tow rope and
[3:41:15.580 --> 3:41:22.300]  because of the hysteria somebody mistook it for a hate symbol just like somebody did at michigan
[3:41:22.300 --> 3:41:29.340]  state university when the noose that they found turned out to be just a broken shoelace or like
[3:41:29.340 --> 3:41:37.340]  the nooses found in an oakland park which just turned out to be exercise equipment or the kkk
[3:41:37.340 --> 3:41:42.300]  rally that a student thought they saw through the window at bowling green state university which
[3:41:42.300 --> 3:41:51.580]  turned out to be some lab equipment that had plastic coverings over it so this sounds like
[3:41:51.580 --> 3:41:57.740]  get another justy smollett style media contrived hate crime hoax and in fact there's a tweet which
[3:41:57.740 --> 3:42:02.780]  i'd retweeted earlier from an account called the last refuge he makes a comparison shot
[3:42:03.500 --> 3:42:11.260]  of this garage from the outside the same garage from november 2019 and june 2020 and the rope is in
[3:42:11.260 --> 3:42:18.300]  the same position on both images the only difference being in the june 2020 shot the bottom part of the
[3:42:18.300 --> 3:42:25.020]  rope the noose which is actually a thing to draw down the garage door has been removed so this is
[3:42:25.020 --> 3:42:32.620]  quickly falling apart another contrived hate crime hoax by the looks of it we're going to come back
[3:42:32.620 --> 3:42:38.060]  in the next segment and talk about the redding terrorist attack which happened in the uk on
[3:42:38.060 --> 3:42:43.260]  saturday night which is basically already being forgotten about by the mainstream media once again
[3:42:43.260 --> 3:42:49.100]  because it doesn't fit their narrative breaking news at summit dot news don't go away we'll be right back

[3:43:26.860 --> 3:43:32.300]  percent off out of the gates it was listeners idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle
[3:43:32.300 --> 3:43:36.700]  that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it
[3:43:36.700 --> 3:43:41.340]  and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way get your survival

[3:44:22.300 --> 3:44:27.740]  that show everyone is positive and despite that they're still testing record numbers of people
[3:44:27.740 --> 3:44:33.420]  creating hysteria and saying the numbers spiking and why it'll be 200 000 dead by the election

[3:48:13.100 --> 3:48:21.980]  please support the network today now going back to 2011 of course we had the completely disastrous
[3:48:21.980 --> 3:48:29.020]  intervention in libya toppling a secular leader yet again in colonel gadafi and opening up a
[3:48:29.020 --> 3:48:35.660]  vacuum for islamic extremists and warlords to take control of the country now i made this
[3:48:35.660 --> 3:48:39.820]  point in regard to the redding terror attack the connection to which i'll get on to in a moment on
[3:48:40.860 --> 3:48:46.380]  a couple of days ago i believe was someone responded because i blamed hillary clinton and
[3:48:46.380 --> 3:48:51.580]  obama for approving this disastrous regime change in libya they were behind it they were the main
[3:48:51.580 --> 3:48:57.020]  progenitors behind it ended up with black people literally being imprisoned in concentration camps
[3:48:57.740 --> 3:49:03.180]  no black lives matter protests after that occurred but somebody responded the intervention in libya
[3:49:03.180 --> 3:49:09.900]  was in support of un security council resolution 1973 okay the intervention in libya led to the
[3:49:09.900 --> 3:49:15.900]  rise of isis it led to the migrant crisis and it led to numerous terror attacks around the west
[3:49:15.900 --> 3:49:23.660]  including by the way the paris massacre a number of culprits of which abuse the migrant refugee
[3:49:23.660 --> 3:49:29.180]  wave to get into europe in the first place and in fact isis bragged about how they did that
[3:49:29.180 --> 3:49:34.940]  in their own magazine to beat and we've covered that before so it led to numerous terror attacks
[3:49:34.940 --> 3:49:39.820]  it led to the rise of isis the spread of isis and of course the migrant crisis that continues to
[3:49:39.820 --> 3:49:45.740]  affect us today it was a disastrous intervention it was at the behest of hillary clinton who
[3:49:45.740 --> 3:49:51.180]  literally cackled when they told the gadafi was dead and barack obama ended up with warlords
[3:49:51.180 --> 3:49:56.380]  controlling the country a complete cesspit black people in concentration camps it was
[3:49:56.380 --> 3:50:02.700]  horrendous and we're still feeling the after effects to this day headline he was defending
[3:50:02.700 --> 3:50:08.700]  himself from racist uk claims brother of redding terrorists who stabbed three people to death
[3:50:09.500 --> 3:50:14.780]  so what happened on saturday evening was that people were enjoying the sunshine having picnics
[3:50:14.780 --> 3:50:21.900]  having barbecues in a park in redding which is a town about an hour away from london and this person
[3:50:21.900 --> 3:50:27.740]  walks up to them and starts stabbing them in the neck now where was this individual from take a
[3:50:27.740 --> 3:50:34.460]  wild guess yes he was from libya he was an asylum seeker he was a refugee he was brought into the
[3:50:34.460 --> 3:50:40.940]  country as a result of the overthrow of gadafi and the power vacuum in libya he would not have
[3:50:40.940 --> 3:50:46.860]  been in the country stabbing people in the neck stabbing people under the arm on a pleasant summer's
[3:50:46.860 --> 3:50:52.460]  evening in redding unless we had brought him into the country unless we had overthrown gadafi
[3:50:53.180 --> 3:50:58.540]  oh but gadafi tortured some people okay you want to compare that to what's happened since
[3:50:58.540 --> 3:51:05.660]  how many people did ices kill over the past five six years but according to the terrorist brother
[3:51:05.660 --> 3:51:14.220]  he was just defending himself and you can believe that in fact sky news they do this every time
[3:51:14.220 --> 3:51:19.660]  they go and talk to the family of the terrorist and devote an entire article to them saying oh
[3:51:19.660 --> 3:51:25.980]  he was a good boy he was just a bit mentally confused in fact douglas murray writes to the
[3:51:25.980 --> 3:51:31.980]  spectator what isn't being said about the redding terror attack victims imagine if on a saturday
[3:51:31.980 --> 3:51:37.580]  evening a white neo-nazi had stabbed three men to death imagine furthermore if in the wake of
[3:51:37.580 --> 3:51:43.020]  the killings it had turned out that all three of the victims were gay because yes by the way all
[3:51:43.020 --> 3:51:49.740]  three fatalities he stabbed about six people total if not more but the three fatalities were all
[3:51:49.740 --> 3:51:56.620]  lgbt not a big uproar about that in the lgbt community in terms of why they were targeted
[3:51:57.580 --> 3:52:02.620]  he goes on to say all members of the lgbt community to use the lexicon at the time
[3:52:02.620 --> 3:52:08.700]  and then imagine if two days later nobody in the uk or anywhere else was very interested in any of
[3:52:08.700 --> 3:52:14.220]  this so what if all the victims were gay why bother sifting around for motives what are you trying to
[3:52:14.220 --> 3:52:21.100]  say bigot and we've had a lot of attacks of people coming out of gay nightclubs who get slashed and
[3:52:21.100 --> 3:52:26.460]  the story disappears a couple of days later but they don't really want to look into it because
[3:52:26.460 --> 3:52:32.300]  again it doesn't fit the narrative if it was a white neo-nazi stabbing three gay people to death
[3:52:32.300 --> 3:52:37.180]  on a saturday afternoon you can bet that would be the narrative the next day but because this guy
[3:52:37.180 --> 3:52:43.900]  was a refugee now it's completely disappeared we've got premier league multimillionaire footballers
[3:52:44.780 --> 3:52:51.180]  taking a knee before each game they didn't even do it once they're doing it before each game over
[3:52:51.180 --> 3:52:58.380]  a guy who was killed in america four thousand miles away one person of color was killed in the
[3:52:58.380 --> 3:53:05.100]  entire uk in the entire year of 2019 he was the london bridge terrorist yet we've got premiership
[3:53:05.100 --> 3:53:10.860]  football has taken a knee for that who's going to take a knee for the victims of the redding terror
[3:53:10.860 --> 3:53:16.860]  attack absolutely nobody in fact i don't even know if they had a minute silence before all the
[3:53:16.860 --> 3:53:22.780]  football games over the past couple of days they certainly did for black lives matter kind of ironic
[3:53:22.780 --> 3:53:29.340]  that a giant multi-billion enterprise like the premier league is taking a knee for violent
[3:53:29.340 --> 3:53:35.340]  revolutionaries who literally want to overthrow capitalism but according to the terrorist brother
[3:53:35.340 --> 3:53:42.300]  i'm wrong he was just defending himself because the uk's racist because that's what people really
[3:53:42.300 --> 3:53:45.900]  should be doing isn't it if they feel offended by something going out stabbing people in the
[3:53:45.900 --> 3:53:52.620]  neck totally rational response 25 year old cariri sedalo is arrested after launching a
[3:53:52.620 --> 3:53:58.620]  vicious attack on a group of people in a park around 7 p.m again this is saturday killing three
[3:53:58.620 --> 3:54:03.020]  and injuring three others as he stabbed them in the neck authorities quickly concluded that the
[3:54:03.020 --> 3:54:08.780]  incident was a terrorist attack by the way this happened two hours after a blm protest in the same
[3:54:08.780 --> 3:54:15.420]  area and later carried out a raid and a controlled explosion at the suspect's home and the first hour
[3:54:15.420 --> 3:54:20.060]  or two the media was first of all they were they were very keen to stress that this had nothing to
[3:54:20.060 --> 3:54:26.780]  do with blm now i'm sure they'd afford the same kind of treatment to a right wing rally or an
[3:54:26.780 --> 3:54:32.460]  anti-lockdown rally if a stabbing of six people occurred two hours after i'm sure they'd afford
[3:54:32.460 --> 3:54:37.100]  is the same treatment so there's nothing to do with blm but then they started saying it wasn't
[3:54:37.100 --> 3:54:43.100]  even a terrorist attack even as the riot police the armed riot police were raiding the suspect's
[3:54:43.100 --> 3:54:49.100]  home and carrying out control explosions of course now they're saying he was just mentally ill of
[3:54:49.100 --> 3:54:53.740]  course every single time however the terrorist brother responded to the news story on facebook
[3:54:53.740 --> 3:55:00.380]  by claiming that his sibling was a victim of racism and that he was merely defending himself
[3:55:01.260 --> 3:55:08.140]  by stabbing three people to death mo sadala the brother of the terrorist said quote this is not
[3:55:08.140 --> 3:55:15.180]  true kairi defended himself racist countries freedom for my brother before and then he went on to
[3:55:15.180 --> 3:55:24.540]  say we are not terrorists or terrorists as he wrote and f england so another really well integrated
[3:55:24.540 --> 3:55:29.900]  migrant there obviously 20 year old eyewitness laurence war described the horror that unfolded
[3:55:29.900 --> 3:55:35.740]  during the attack he said suddenly shout someone shouted some intelligible words went around a
[3:55:35.740 --> 3:55:41.020]  large group of around 10 trying to stab them again we don't know if they were targeted because they
[3:55:41.020 --> 3:55:46.140]  were gay how he knew they were gay i don't know maybe they were a couple maybe they were physically
[3:55:46.140 --> 3:55:51.980]  close to each other but no one's asking that question so nobody knows he stabbed three of them
[3:55:51.980 --> 3:55:55.660]  severely in the neck and under the arms and then turned and started running towards me and we turned
[3:55:55.660 --> 3:56:00.620]  and started running when he realized he couldn't catch us he tried to stab another group sat down
[3:56:01.180 --> 3:56:05.260]  imagine you're in the park with your friends having a barbecue and some lunatics runs up and
[3:56:05.260 --> 3:56:10.940]  stabs them in the neck that you think that'd be a pretty big story for the uk where in comparison
[3:56:10.940 --> 3:56:16.860]  to america we don't really get a ton of fatalities in terms of the stabbing slot people stabbed
[3:56:16.860 --> 3:56:22.460]  love into gang warfare happens a summer's afternoon in a park people having barbecues
