[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:30.600]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.600 --> 00:37.000]  there's a lot of evidence that Hugo Chavez is political communist air stole
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.800]  the election last year and now they're on the verge of civil war in Venezuela
[00:44.800 --> 00:49.560]  where the power has been going out on a daily basis so there's food shortages
[00:49.560 --> 00:57.880]  incredible inflation 50 plus percent per month in some months drugreport.com
[00:57.880 --> 01:03.000]  has the headline Venezuela on the brink showing the riot police with their
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.280]  shotguns so that is just some of the news going on as we look what it's like
[01:09.280 --> 01:15.080]  to live under a kleptocratic government. Speaking of kleptocratic
[01:15.080 --> 01:20.160]  government we're going to be getting into Obama and his latest arrogant
[01:20.160 --> 01:24.680]  statement when we come back from break. Obama says signing up for Obamacare is
[01:24.680 --> 01:30.040]  just part of growing up and of course if you have a business you didn't build
[01:30.040 --> 01:36.760]  that and it's part of your responsibility to pay a foreign tax to
[01:36.760 --> 01:42.560]  offshore cartels and Republicans say Obama violated constitution but little
[01:42.560 --> 01:49.800]  can be done about it that's what Fox News is reporting. No one has violated the
[01:49.800 --> 01:54.920]  Constitution more than Obama in modern history. Abraham Lincoln violated it
[01:54.920 --> 02:00.440]  even more than Obama but you could argue that was during a civil war and the
[02:00.440 --> 02:06.080]  Obama oids or the Obamaites the Obama supporters they've been billing him as
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.000]  Lincoln from the time he ran for president going back about eight years
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.680]  ago about a year and a half before he got into office they were already calling
[02:12.680 --> 02:17.680]  him the new Lincoln and saying he would have to seize power if people got in his
[02:17.680 --> 02:25.280]  way. Clearly that would be illegitimate if he did that and he tries to start some
[02:25.280 --> 02:30.240]  civil war with gun confiscation or something. The civil war of the 1860s
[02:30.240 --> 02:34.520]  was much more complex and was an ongoing struggle going back to the days of the
[02:34.520 --> 02:38.920]  colonies between unfair taxation between the industrial north and the
[02:38.920 --> 02:46.720]  agrarian farming south and that was the main issue was tariffs and trade not
[02:46.720 --> 02:55.240]  slavery but in the modern textbooks it is a fanciful piece of propaganda just
[02:55.240 --> 03:00.520]  like global warming or other other fairy tales and the truth is the evil of
[03:00.520 --> 03:04.720]  slavery was already on its way out when the civil war started but that in itself
[03:04.720 --> 03:10.920]  is a diversionary historical factoid. The issue is Obama is becoming a
[03:10.920 --> 03:18.280]  dictator and even mainline publications point out like the Washington
[03:18.280 --> 03:24.160]  Times Obama's executive actions can backfire on Democrats if GOP takes the
[03:24.160 --> 03:31.400]  White House. Well you it's like Ron Paul used to say if he got elected president
[03:31.400 --> 03:37.120]  he couldn't just fix everything because he couldn't act as a dictator. I mean
[03:37.120 --> 03:40.920]  let's say Rand Paul or Ted Cruz got elected they couldn't piece by piece
[03:40.920 --> 03:47.560]  implement or unimplement de-implement Obamacare you just can't do that as the
[03:47.560 --> 03:52.520]  president Obama is doing that to selectively let his friends off the hook
[03:52.520 --> 04:00.600]  and that's the very nature the very blood the very elixir of corruption and
[04:00.600 --> 04:04.520]  discrimination is to have a political system where things are selectively
[04:04.520 --> 04:11.040]  enforced where where justice is not blind and and this new water system with
[04:11.040 --> 04:17.240]  the NSA and all its surveillance systems is completely aware hyper aware of
[04:17.240 --> 04:21.760]  what's going on and uses all these systems to game the global infrastructure
[04:21.760 --> 04:25.320]  to consolidate total control in their hands and that's the debate we've got
[04:25.320 --> 04:28.400]  to have that's the issue that's got to be discussed we're going to turn this
[04:28.400 --> 04:31.400]  around so that's just some of what's coming up there's just so much news
[04:31.400 --> 04:36.640]  today we are going to get a very interesting national security expert
[04:36.640 --> 04:41.520]  on to talk about real terror threats here in North America Michael Maloof
[04:41.520 --> 04:45.840]  with WorldNet daily to talk about these attacks on the power grid at nuclear
[04:45.840 --> 04:50.640]  power plants you name it what does he think is really behind that and then we
[04:50.640 --> 04:54.120]  had Skype problems with the lead singer of Corn last Friday but he's scheduled
[04:54.120 --> 05:00.800]  to be with us today Jonathan Davis is coming up as well Alex Jones there to
[05:00.800 --> 05:04.520]  tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying

[08:40.080 --> 08:44.800]  next three hours today thank you so much for tuning in to this transmission
[08:44.800 --> 08:49.880]  wow there is so much to go over Venezuela is teetering on the edge on the
[08:49.880 --> 08:57.840]  brink of a civil war as the opposition leader is being sought for arrest and
[08:57.840 --> 09:01.400]  he's calling for a march that he will lead where he plans to be arrested
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.880]  obviously catapulting himself into cult status to then counter the communist
[09:05.880 --> 09:10.800]  leader of the country who clearly stole the last election after the dear leader
[09:10.800 --> 09:17.240]  Hugo Chavez went up to the big Politburo in the sky so we're going to be
[09:17.240 --> 09:23.560]  breaking all of that down today we've got Chase imposes new capital controls on
[09:23.560 --> 09:28.520]  cash deposits member Chase started doing this for people transferring money out
[09:28.520 --> 09:31.960]  of the country last year and then a bunch of other banks followed suit and they
[09:31.960 --> 09:36.720]  tried to basically deny these were capital controls well now you can't you
[09:36.720 --> 09:44.120]  know after you you know say run a cake walk or you know some type of event to
[09:44.120 --> 09:47.480]  raise money for charity you can't just put it in an envelope under the
[09:47.480 --> 09:50.960]  accounts number and go drop it in the bank like I did many times when I was a
[09:50.960 --> 09:53.600]  child my dad or my mom at for some charity event would go drop it in the
[09:53.600 --> 09:56.160]  local bank you know the hundred dollars two hundred dollars wherever they'd
[09:56.160 --> 10:00.560]  raised now you've got to come in and show an ID because you might be a money
[10:00.560 --> 10:04.840]  launder meanwhile they let the illegals get back accounts without IDs on record
[10:04.840 --> 10:08.760]  they let the big mega banks launder hundreds of billions of dollars a year
[10:08.760 --> 10:12.800]  conservatively here in the US alone all on record but but oh they're going to
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.040]  stop money laundering and everything no it's about tracking everything you do
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.680]  and controlling small business that's why they're trying to shut down the
[10:20.680 --> 10:25.800]  lemonade stands the bake sales that's why they're harassing anybody that you
[10:25.800 --> 10:31.400]  know tries to have a co-op where you work with a farmer to have cows for you
[10:31.400 --> 10:34.600]  that he takes care of that then he butchers for you to get your own
[10:34.600 --> 10:37.840]  fresh organic meat it turns out being cheaper than the stuff you buy at the
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.800]  store they don't want that type of economy being rediscovered they want you
[10:43.800 --> 10:49.040]  to only buy out of their big box stores so we're going to be breaking that down
[10:49.040 --> 10:53.360]  as well Oliver Stone has come out over the weekend Paul Watson wrote an article
[10:53.360 --> 10:57.560]  at info wars.com it's on drudgereport.com as well Oliver Stone
[10:57.560 --> 11:03.040]  Obama's lack of spine is stunning leftist filmmaker Oliver Stone is slam
[11:03.040 --> 11:08.680]  president Barack Obama during an event this packed week accusing Obama of
[11:08.680 --> 11:13.040]  selling out as soon as he got into office exhibiting a stunning lack of spine
[11:13.040 --> 11:20.320]  he previously called him a snake and by the way whenever I say that most of
[11:20.320 --> 11:25.400]  Hollywood is awake most Hollywood people I talked to know about the New
[11:25.400 --> 11:29.120]  World Order know about global governance know about you Genesis know
[11:29.120 --> 11:32.440]  about the real system because they're smart people and they don't want to be
[11:32.440 --> 11:36.240]  liberal and they don't want to be conservative they just want to be pro
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.000]  liberty they're more libertarian and by the way Oliver Stone was speaking at a
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.920]  libertarian conference put on by the future of Freedom Foundation so there's
[11:48.920 --> 11:52.520]  an example right there that's why the libertarians are exploding because
[11:52.520 --> 11:55.200]  there are people on the left and the right who are getting outside those
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.200]  labels and just saying you know what I want local control I want transparency I
[11:59.200 --> 12:05.840]  don't want offshore corporate directives running my life and the left is
[12:05.840 --> 12:08.880]  starting to figure out that big corporations have been financing big
[12:08.880 --> 12:12.920]  government the whole time not as some empowerment mechanism but as a
[12:12.920 --> 12:18.160]  monopoly mechanism there's been a pipe bomb discovered in carry-on luggage at
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.000]  Anchorage Airport TSA agents found with Ted Stevens Anchorage International
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.320]  Airport police have described as a pipe bomb and a carry-on luggage of a man
[12:29.320 --> 12:35.080]  ticketed on an oil worker flight to North Slope Sunday forcing an hour shut
[12:35.080 --> 12:38.120]  down of the security checkpoint the man initially claimed these small
[12:38.120 --> 12:43.760]  explosives was a avalanche device said Jesse Davis chief of the airport police
[12:43.760 --> 12:47.240]  and fire department I don't know of any avalanche dangers up there on the North
[12:47.240 --> 12:50.640]  Slope he said the FBI is interviewing the man whose name has not yet been
[12:50.640 --> 12:53.440]  released police downplayed the incident saying the public was never in
[12:53.440 --> 12:57.240]  danger and the pipe bomb appeared to lack any triggering device no motive is
[12:57.240 --> 13:03.920]  yet known you know my I just know the criminology most of the time if it's
[13:03.920 --> 13:10.480]  not a staged attack it is people that have a fetish of seeing if they could
[13:10.480 --> 13:14.280]  sneak something through airport security I've just seen this over and over again
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.840]  I love firefighters they're great people on average and and wonderful folks but
[13:19.840 --> 13:24.080]  the police know you can look this up that most the time when a pipe bomb is
[13:24.080 --> 13:28.960]  found or if there's a suspicious fire that some volunteer firefighter shows
[13:28.960 --> 13:34.000]  up at first that in many cases it's a very small minority but but still that
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.040]  minority is responsible for a lot of the arson and a lot of the pipe bomb
[13:38.040 --> 13:44.440]  activity and I just saw this over the last 18 19 years on air that so many
[13:44.440 --> 13:48.640]  times you'd hear about a firefighter getting busted planting a pipe bomb that
[13:48.640 --> 13:53.480]  was inert and then finding the pipe bomb and diffusing it and being a hero they've
[13:53.480 --> 13:57.200]  caught police bomb squad people doing the same thing can you imagine being on a
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.280]  bomb squad and never having any real bombs to dismantle and millions are
[14:01.280 --> 14:05.200]  spent in every major city per year with all these robots and the rest of it so a
[14:05.200 --> 14:11.680]  lot of times the very people who you would expect to be out there trying to
[14:11.680 --> 14:15.320]  stop something are the ones behind it I mean I don't know what's behind that I'm
[14:15.320 --> 14:25.240]  just simply simply speculating on that whole on that whole situation and I
[14:25.240 --> 14:28.280]  tell you it's finally starting to hit mainstream news I mentioned some of
[14:28.280 --> 14:32.720]  this yesterday and it really is sad and it's what the whole MSNBC culture has
[14:32.720 --> 14:37.560]  created total racial division for big city
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.600]  balkanization politics Clarence Thomas came out last week and said when he was
[14:41.600 --> 14:47.280]  going to college in Georgia in the 60s early 60s that he ran into a fraction
[14:47.280 --> 14:54.880]  I believe the quote was one-tenth of the uncomfortable race stuff that he runs
[14:54.880 --> 15:02.880]  into now and then it's the left always pushing it and promoting it and the so
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.840]  called liberal media absolutely viciously attacked him for saying quote my
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.840]  sadness is that we're probably today more race and difference conscience that I
[15:11.840 --> 15:15.600]  was in the 60s I was at school to my knowledge I was the first black kid in
[15:15.600 --> 15:19.520]  Savannah Georgia to go to a white school rarely did the issue of race come up
[15:19.520 --> 15:24.560]  Thomas said now name a day it doesn't come up differences and race differences
[15:24.560 --> 15:28.240]  and sex anybody doesn't look at you right somebody says something everybody is
[15:28.240 --> 15:33.360]  sensitive if I had been as sensitive as that in the 1960s I'd still be in
[15:33.360 --> 15:38.120]  Savannah and he goes on with more quotes basically repeating what you said earlier
[15:38.120 --> 15:42.400]  and they came out and viciously attacking meanwhile it came out in two
[15:42.400 --> 15:47.280]  different articles yesterday one of them a disabled vet another one some guy
[15:47.280 --> 15:52.560]  going home at night whites being beaten up in Cleveland and many other areas
[15:52.560 --> 15:57.040]  and being told on video because the gang shoot the video beat up that cracker take
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.480]  his money and you see the racial attacks in Austin that happen almost every day
[16:01.480 --> 16:05.520]  that I I see in the news every week's guaranteed is going on every day I talk
[16:05.520 --> 16:09.000]  to folks that live downtown they say it's epidemic and it's predominantly black
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.600]  males young black males going out and beating up hippies that they see are
[16:13.600 --> 16:19.040]  defenseless and weak and I guess a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves but
[16:19.040 --> 16:26.440]  that's what's going on now we have a mob of black kids terrorizing Victoria's
[16:26.440 --> 16:32.800]  secret shoppers and that's being reported on I mean this is really becoming a
[16:32.800 --> 16:38.680]  serious situation and this was not going on six years ago this was not going on
[16:38.680 --> 16:43.280]  I mean it's very rare to have this type of stuff and it's racially motivated and
[16:43.280 --> 16:47.400]  it's just like the Klan going out and rolling some black guy coming out of his
[16:47.400 --> 16:52.040]  business at night and why would racist white groups go target people well
[16:52.040 --> 16:55.080]  because you know they're bad groups so they don't you know they don't deserve
[16:55.080 --> 17:01.040]  freedom let's go beat them up it's the same thing with rolling gay people the
[17:01.040 --> 17:06.920]  term rolling that that went on for 50 years in this country if if young
[17:06.920 --> 17:10.760]  fraternity guys or whatever wanted to go steal somebody's wallet and get some
[17:10.760 --> 17:17.080]  money for beer well they're good Christian men so they wouldn't beat up
[17:17.080 --> 17:21.240]  just a regular person and take their money they would go find two guys coming
[17:21.240 --> 17:25.880]  out of a gay bar and beat them half to death and then take their money because
[17:25.880 --> 17:32.000]  it was seen as culturally acceptable to do that well it's not culturally
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.920]  acceptable to beat up a white person a black person a gay person a straight
[17:36.920 --> 17:43.240]  person a old person a young person just because I mean I see cases of people
[17:43.240 --> 17:48.000]  get beat up for the sports team they're wearing one time in college I walked
[17:48.000 --> 17:56.160]  into a bar with a black football hat cap I can't remember even what the symbol
[17:56.160 --> 18:01.000]  was and they came over and said you can't wear that hat I said why and they
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.360]  said don't ask her when throw you out and I said okay I'll take it off you know
[18:04.360 --> 18:08.520]  thug bouncers I was there with some dates and I went over there I said really
[18:08.520 --> 18:12.040]  I just want to know why and he went because it's gang related that's a gang
[18:12.040 --> 18:16.800]  hat and then who knows it might have been I just didn't know this shows how
[18:16.800 --> 18:22.280]  mindless all of this is and it's completely out of control but here's
[18:22.280 --> 18:26.640]  the story right here black mobs terrorized Victoria's secret shoppers
[18:26.640 --> 18:32.880]  from world net daily it was also the Associated Press and it goes on some
[18:32.880 --> 18:36.040]  were surprised to hear about the black mob violence on Valentine's Day
[18:36.040 --> 18:41.920]  Victoria's Secret in Norfolk Virginia not at the violence the gallery at
[18:41.920 --> 18:45.160]  military circle has been the site of dozens of episodes of racial lawlessness
[18:45.160 --> 18:50.160]  over the last two years but of which has gone unreported in local paper the
[18:50.160 --> 18:54.240]  surprise is that the mall is still open most of its major tenants are gone or
[18:54.240 --> 19:00.080]  leaving Sears JC Penning the nearly double tree also closed the big draw
[19:00.080 --> 19:04.680]  there is the movie theater would cheat tickets more than 25% of the space is
[19:04.680 --> 19:11.040]  vacant dead malls.com says the mall is a zombie that is really dead but just acts
[19:11.040 --> 19:16.120]  alive the latest example of black mob violence came on Valentine's Day as a
[19:16.120 --> 19:20.600]  large group of people fought in Victoria's Secret store one guy pulled out a
[19:20.600 --> 19:26.400]  gun and shot someone leg in urban lingo shooting someone leg is called leg
[19:26.400 --> 19:33.720]  warming it is often a warning about comparing with police or selling drugs
[19:33.720 --> 19:37.360]  or competing with them and someone else's territory or even refusing to
[19:37.360 --> 19:42.320]  give someone a pit bull puppy and it just goes on from there and then this
[19:42.320 --> 19:49.400]  maybe mainly you know gang type stuff but it's really getting bad and it needs
[19:49.400 --> 19:53.720]  to stop the sucker punching of white people that's killing some folks I
[19:53.720 --> 20:00.920]  mean it's wrong but MSNBC they're basically behind it we travel so much
[20:00.920 --> 20:06.560]  and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind burglars look for houses that
[20:06.560 --> 20:12.200]  appear to be easy targets but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into
[20:12.200 --> 20:16.320]  thinking someone is home watching television as a recent widow living alone
[20:16.320 --> 20:21.120]  it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that
[20:21.120 --> 20:25.240]  passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when
[20:25.240 --> 20:30.440]  I'm actually away from home fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a

[21:12.840 --> 21:17.000]  charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a

[24:12.640 --> 24:18.120]  when I say MSNBC more than anybody else is responsible for this epidemic of new
[24:18.120 --> 24:23.400]  racism in this country it's true I mean you you turn it on it's as a tiny
[24:23.400 --> 24:30.120]  audience but still it's it's adhered to by Obama worshippers any opposition to
[24:30.120 --> 24:40.080]  Obamacare to anti-gun movements to globalism to anything to debt limits
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.480]  being increased if you have any opposition to that you're a racist and
[24:45.480 --> 24:50.880]  they sit up there and say it with authority and so the idea is well
[24:50.880 --> 24:56.080]  people aren't being friendly to Obama because they're racist and it becomes
[24:56.080 --> 25:01.400]  this anti-white movement because the Democratic Party has become a purely
[25:01.400 --> 25:09.040]  racialist party based on race baiting race pimping race hustling that's
[25:09.040 --> 25:15.040]  exactly what goes on and I'm sick of it everybody I know sick of it and it is
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.280]  meant to take a president who people elected including a large portion of
[25:19.280 --> 25:27.160]  whites hoping to bring unity and they've used it absolutely to create
[25:28.480 --> 25:34.080]  disunity and control to the point with political correctness now that a student
[25:34.080 --> 25:41.840]  was forced to apologize for emailing a picture of Obama kicking a door because
[25:41.840 --> 25:47.240]  of racism that's right it was seen as somehow racist to email a picture of
[25:47.240 --> 25:53.080]  Obama kicking a door just if anything is seen as a bad light I guess it flies
[25:53.080 --> 25:56.840]  landing on Obama and you see it that means you're racist and you know we
[25:56.840 --> 26:01.880]  laugh at this but this is mind control all they discriminate against all of us
[26:01.880 --> 26:05.200]  I don't care what color you are where you're from with these foreign banks with
[26:05.200 --> 26:10.080]  Obamacare and think about Obamacare doubling tripling quadrupling
[26:10.080 --> 26:13.520]  depending on your plan cutting the quality of care kicking people off their
[26:13.520 --> 26:17.920]  pre-existing plans kicking people with pre-existing conditions off setting up
[26:17.920 --> 26:23.120]  death panels rationing care everything we said it would do quite frankly worse
[26:23.120 --> 26:27.200]  than I thought I mean we knew what was in the bill but it's even worse than we
[26:27.200 --> 26:31.080]  thought so we were wrong it's worse than we thought Ted Cruz was wrong it's
[26:31.080 --> 26:37.840]  worse than he said but if they can get away with that why not do more I mean
[26:37.840 --> 26:43.200]  they really are getting away with everything right now and that's why the
[26:43.200 --> 26:47.080]  whole establishment is going with the Democrats and the Republicans were
[26:47.080 --> 26:49.840]  getting all this stuff done I'd be against them as well but with the
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.760]  Democrats they have found their their wedge and they are driving it right into
[26:54.760 --> 26:59.480]  our heart and in and culture's right when she said that he would be impeached if
[26:59.480 --> 27:03.520]  he were not black and she's absolutely right that is the only issue and it's
[27:03.520 --> 27:07.080]  the triumph of political correctness it's why Hillary Clinton even though she's
[27:07.080 --> 27:12.200]  so corrupt and has so much baggage and is such a warmonger and such a fraud she
[27:12.200 --> 27:16.080]  may get elected because well I mean she's a woman I mean you're not against
[27:16.080 --> 27:21.040]  women are you you've got to elect her or you're against women but then Sarah
[27:21.040 --> 27:25.800]  Palin who is an angel compared to Hillary Clinton certainly not perfect but
[27:25.800 --> 27:33.200]  an angel oh she's stupid she's an idiot she's oh but when the left calls her an
[27:33.200 --> 27:38.040]  idiot and a moron they're not putting a woman down they're just putting some you
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.040]  know lady with a weird accent from Alaska down I mean you know and and making
[27:43.040 --> 27:48.120]  a seat it's a total double standard with these people let's go ahead and go to
[27:48.120 --> 27:53.360]  cultures comment on this he is vetoing legislation by refusing to enforce it
[27:53.360 --> 27:58.800]  if the Constitution demands that the president of the United States take
[27:58.800 --> 28:03.560]  care that the laws be faithfully executed he has simply taken it upon himself to
[28:03.560 --> 28:07.400]  rewrite Obamacare to rewrite immigration laws you indicated with the dreamers
[28:07.400 --> 28:14.240]  thing to rewrite drug laws now we're not Colorado and Washington oh sure just
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.360]  legalized drugs that the federal government that Congress has written and
[28:18.360 --> 28:23.160]  made illegal it's this is the bottom of the slippery slope and I think he would
[28:23.160 --> 28:28.640]  be impeached if he weren't America's first black president now let's expand on
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.680]  that let's go to this clip where Obama tells Charles Barkley signing up for
[28:32.680 --> 28:38.400]  Obamacare is just part of growing up we'd like to encourage more young people
[28:38.400 --> 28:42.800]  to sign up partly because the since they're healthier their premiums are
[28:42.800 --> 28:49.480]  actually generally gonna be fairly they can find good options for less than
[28:49.480 --> 28:53.440]  their cable bill less than their cell phone bill and it's just part of growing
[28:53.440 --> 28:56.840]  up is making sure that you're taking care your body taking care your health and
[28:56.840 --> 29:00.440]  if you've got a young family you know you've got to make sure that your family
[29:00.440 --> 29:04.840]  is protected with health insurance as well and this allows you to do it by the
[29:04.840 --> 29:07.880]  way he said for everybody it'd be cheaper than your phone bill or cable
[29:07.880 --> 29:11.560]  bill of course you know it's not true it's massively increased it they admit
[29:11.560 --> 29:15.160]  Obamacare will fail for the big insurance companies that wrote it with the
[29:15.160 --> 29:19.200]  Republican leadership you notice if they can't get all the young dumb people to
[29:19.200 --> 29:23.720]  sign up for it at what is in some cases five times what it used to be for young
[29:23.720 --> 29:27.760]  people so you notice he went well in some cases it's gonna be lower they're
[29:27.760 --> 29:31.400]  gonna just hammer the young people they're like it's my Obamacare as if
[29:31.400 --> 29:35.320]  you couldn't go out and get insurance before by the way the right scoop has
[29:35.320 --> 29:39.520]  the report here and it's true the GOP established for once the IRS to go after
[29:39.520 --> 29:43.440]  the Tea Party that's why they won't investigate the IRS persecuting
[29:43.440 --> 29:47.680]  people because the Tea Party is the only real opposition this is bipartisan
[29:47.680 --> 29:55.120]  screw job we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[34:37.720 --> 34:47.240]  trying to get people to realize just how serious the stakes are you know I have a
[34:47.240 --> 34:52.360]  friend who is an infantryman or was an infantryman he's now the head chef of a
[34:52.360 --> 34:58.240]  major steakhouse here in Austin in the army and he sent me a text this morning
[34:58.240 --> 35:03.200]  and I forgot to get back with him he wanted to call in about the urban
[35:03.200 --> 35:08.960]  warfare training going on in Virginia with the 300 acre mock US city complete
[35:08.960 --> 35:17.160]  with Baptist churches and subways and handicapped parking and of course in
[35:17.160 --> 35:24.120]  Ohio last week we reported on local news they reported on the fact that they're
[35:24.120 --> 35:27.600]  they're training with the National Guard for scenarios where gun owners
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.880]  pro second amendment groups carry out acts of terrorism and the main branding
[35:32.880 --> 35:39.160]  of terrorism is now on to veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians you
[35:39.160 --> 35:44.680]  know that the point is they're not just hiding it in memos now and then we get
[35:44.680 --> 35:50.840]  the information and it becomes a story this is being openly flaunted and he
[35:50.840 --> 35:59.520]  sent me text this morning saying he'd be happy to come on and discuss it it's my
[35:59.520 --> 36:07.280]  friend Matt the same guy that we were able to get on he was the guy that was
[36:07.280 --> 36:12.720]  able to get that to Esquire Colonel that Colonel writing for Esquire talking
[36:12.720 --> 36:15.680]  about we will take your guys from a cold at hands he's the guy that got him to
[36:15.680 --> 36:19.120]  respond and got his phone number for us with the colonel was scared to come on
[36:19.120 --> 36:25.000]  the broadcast and I wanted to I wanted to give Matt a chance to call in and
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.800]  comment on that but I forgot guys I'm gonna dial his number and then create an
[36:28.800 --> 36:33.280]  OTS for him and set him up maybe for the next segment I'm gonna just dial his
[36:33.280 --> 36:35.960]  number for you right now if you come in and get my phone I'll just dial this for
[36:35.960 --> 36:41.800]  you and then you can just call Matt and then set him up and you'll get his full
[36:41.800 --> 36:45.600]  info and then create an OTS for him and get him on because I just remembered that
[36:45.600 --> 36:50.680]  here you go there you go just gonna give that to you thanks a lot fantastic we'll
[36:50.680 --> 36:54.960]  see of Matt answers but he was telling me in the text I mean obviously this is
[36:54.960 --> 36:58.320]  for domestic operations well they admit it's for domestic operations and it's
[36:58.320 --> 37:01.840]  for their new enemy people that are basically still Americans and follow
[37:01.840 --> 37:12.760]  American culture this is a cultural political takeover and it's very very
[37:12.760 --> 37:17.560]  sad that we've gotten to this point but but people just need to be honest with
[37:17.560 --> 37:20.640]  themselves about the position that we're in and we have any chance of ever
[37:20.640 --> 37:28.480]  turning this around we're in a lot of trouble and they're putting the capital
[37:28.480 --> 37:33.120]  controls in they're putting the tracking systems in they are making the police
[37:33.120 --> 37:37.320]  hyper neurotic about making us follow all their orders and that we can be
[37:37.320 --> 37:41.840]  killed if we don't even of their unlawful orders they are converting this
[37:41.840 --> 37:46.880]  society into a kleptocracy and why shouldn't they because if you have a
[37:46.880 --> 37:50.640]  centralized authoritarian system you can take over every industry every job
[37:50.640 --> 37:57.480]  every sector the land the teaching the religion and make the world your world
[37:57.480 --> 38:02.760]  and not have to compete with anybody and that's my biggest problem with
[38:02.760 --> 38:09.120]  authoritarianism is that it destroys competition it exacerbates cronyism and
[38:09.120 --> 38:13.480]  the people that tend to end up running these systems and certainly the case
[38:13.480 --> 38:21.400]  with our elite are very predatory and enjoy hurting people and it's it's
[38:21.400 --> 38:31.600]  fundamental that folks realize how much danger we're in it's fundamental across
[38:31.600 --> 38:34.000]  the board
[38:35.800 --> 38:44.240]  now let me just do this and then I will continue on with some other video
[38:44.240 --> 38:51.280]  clips we're gonna be getting into we just start here with this area of the
[38:51.280 --> 38:59.680]  stack this is out of the right scoop Pat Caddell says the GOP establishment
[38:59.680 --> 39:04.360]  wants the IRS to go after the Tea Party
[39:04.640 --> 39:09.640]  Pat Caddell said yes stay on Fox News and the videos up on infowars.com but the
[39:09.640 --> 39:13.240]  reason Republican leadership hasn't pushed for a high level of investigation
[39:13.240 --> 39:17.120]  of the IRS for targeting the Tea Parties because they want the IRS to go
[39:17.120 --> 39:21.600]  after the Tea Party and that's that's true and the only way to counter this
[39:21.600 --> 39:25.480]  persecution is to point out the Republican leadership on record for the
[39:25.480 --> 39:30.040]  last three years at least has been organizing all the big donors to give
[39:30.040 --> 39:36.040]  money to even Democrats running against Tea Party people or to give money to
[39:36.040 --> 39:41.480]  establishment Republicans to beat Tea Party people and they want them shut
[39:41.480 --> 39:45.080]  down because they're part of the very same kleptocratic team this is a big
[39:45.080 --> 39:50.640]  deal but to have more and more people telling the truth like this will be the
[39:50.640 --> 39:56.800]  beginning of the end of the establishment because when the average
[39:56.800 --> 40:04.320]  person figures out that we're all under attack literally 99.99999% of us we
[40:04.320 --> 40:08.880]  did the math a few years ago of 6,000 superclass the globalist own estimation
[40:08.880 --> 40:13.040]  Rothkopf head of Kissinger groups on estimation you average that to seven
[40:13.040 --> 40:17.720]  a half billion people 6,000 in the seven and a half billion I forget the exact
[40:17.720 --> 40:24.880]  number but it was like point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero something two
[40:24.880 --> 40:33.240]  three or something it's 13 zeros and then a couple other numbers I mean this is
[40:33.240 --> 40:38.240]  ridiculous and then meanwhile that ultra elite Soros and others are the ones
[40:38.240 --> 40:42.400]  funding the socialist movement of rebellion like Occupy Wall Street which
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.480]  means well at many levels but Wall Street's not the problem it's the top
[40:46.480 --> 40:49.560]  four or five banks up there that have insider trading and the whole systems
[40:49.560 --> 40:55.560]  rigged and have created all the derivatives they're the problem that's
[40:55.560 --> 41:05.080]  the worst part about this is they have their cake and eat it too because they're
[41:05.080 --> 41:12.120]  able to create monopolies control the public with low-level socialism exempt
[41:12.120 --> 41:15.640]  themselves from all of it wreck everything and then get more power each
[41:15.640 --> 41:19.800]  level of the crisis off the crisis they created and they've all written books
[41:19.800 --> 41:24.440]  bragging about the Hegelian dialectic of problem reaction solution they follow
[41:24.440 --> 41:28.560]  the very same program over and over again because why because it works I've
[41:28.560 --> 41:31.960]  talked to a lot of top people in government they've been at the highest
[41:31.960 --> 41:37.280]  levels of global counsel and I've been in some of the highest levels myself a
[41:37.280 --> 41:48.720]  few times and the number one rule is don't fix it if it's not broken and so
[41:48.720 --> 41:58.640]  they just continue to do the same thing over and over again because it works and
[41:58.640 --> 42:02.560]  that's how I can see a terror attack like Boston and go well wait let's see
[42:02.560 --> 42:07.080]  if there was a drill this this might have been a real attack let's see okay
[42:07.080 --> 42:10.840]  there was a drill of the exact same thing happening the exact same time oh
[42:10.840 --> 42:14.840]  wait they're covering up the drill oh wait they've got military personnel in
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.600]  plain clothes everywhere with black backpacks clearly meant to confuse the
[42:19.600 --> 42:22.920]  police and the cameras later that mean they were involved they were probably
[42:22.920 --> 42:26.640]  called there to say there was a terror threat now if the people they end up
[42:26.640 --> 42:33.240]  patseeing have connections of the CIA then we know it's an inside job and then
[42:33.240 --> 42:35.800]  it turned out both of them were working for the CIA the older brother
[42:35.800 --> 42:39.560]  definitely being financed through multiple groups out of Georgetown
[42:39.560 --> 42:43.800]  University and then the family says that and now the one brother's putting on
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.640]  guilty and then you've got all the stuff that came out of it I mean and then the
[42:47.640 --> 42:52.720]  dead bodies all getting fished out of the river the cover up and the media
[42:52.720 --> 42:57.680]  being told do not look and in full wars photos the FBI at press conferences
[42:57.680 --> 43:01.040]  we're handing out photos and they're saying don't look at those and the media
[43:01.040 --> 43:09.640]  says yes sir people say how do you know when something stage how do I know when
[43:09.640 --> 43:16.240]  I look at a wood pile in the summer out in the woods and say East Texas there's
[43:16.240 --> 43:21.160]  probably a rattlesnake under it or a copperhead or something like that because
[43:21.160 --> 43:31.000]  I've learned enough driving around on a tractor when you've got a bulldozer front
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.320]  on it and you're you've been tasked with removing piles of debris or bulldozing
[43:35.320 --> 43:40.480]  something that their snakes are gonna come flying out the bottom of it I can
[43:40.480 --> 43:44.040]  look at a big pile of stuff and tell my kids around the woods hey don't don't
[43:44.040 --> 43:49.760]  climb around on that I tell my kids hey you that cardboard box don't stick your
[43:49.760 --> 43:53.120]  hand a cardboard box in a field probably a black widow in there and you turn it
[43:53.120 --> 43:55.840]  over there's a black widow hanging up in the top of it I know where black
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.520]  widows in Texas live because I've seen it about 400 times I know where brown
[44:00.520 --> 44:06.920]  recluses live in your closet under your bed I know what a brown recluse looks
[44:06.920 --> 44:10.720]  like too I know what a copperhead looks like I want a water moxin looks like
[44:10.720 --> 44:18.480]  versus a regular water snake just like anybody else could figure out red on
[44:18.480 --> 44:26.480]  yellow kills a fella versus a false coral snake I mean it's just simple
[44:26.480 --> 44:32.480]  observation you learn how they operate let's say Obama got caught in an affair
[44:32.480 --> 44:36.360]  with some woman tomorrow he would then cruise missiles some third-world country
[44:36.360 --> 44:44.040]  the next day I mean it is they follow an exact program you go see movies like
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.840]  lag the dog that then a year later they follow the exact scenario in Serbia
[44:48.840 --> 44:54.480]  they're telling you how they scripted the whole deal and the movie producer goes
[44:54.480 --> 44:57.400]  well I'm gonna go out the director says I'm gonna go out and brag that I did all
[44:57.400 --> 45:02.360]  this they said sir you can't do that he goes no I am so they kill him you hear
[45:02.360 --> 45:08.120]  at the end of the movie he's had a heart attack and of course I knew this a
[45:08.120 --> 45:10.640]  long time ago but they're now declassifying a lot of it a lot of
[45:10.640 --> 45:14.280]  these Hollywood producers actually work for the globalist they even write up the
[45:14.280 --> 45:18.400]  scripts for what they're gonna stage and then that way when the operatives have
[45:18.400 --> 45:22.000]  the scripts if they get caught by the police or a group that's not part of
[45:22.000 --> 45:28.080]  it this compartmentalized oh it's a script it's a movie script
[45:29.520 --> 45:40.800]  that's how they run these operation that's what they do and it's so frustrating
[45:40.800 --> 45:46.600]  to see all this going on and of course I said weeks ago here on air that the IRS
[45:46.600 --> 45:58.080]  is not going after the Democrats because they are the establishment party and
[45:58.080 --> 46:00.640]  they're not going after establishment Republicans because they're part of the
[46:00.640 --> 46:06.080]  establishment they're only going after the Tea Party gun owners gun groups pro
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.320]  life groups people that have any sense of morals any sense of not doing whatever
[46:11.320 --> 46:18.440]  the power structure says this is a full-scale political persecution and I
[46:18.440 --> 46:21.680]  pointed out the Republicans are not going after the IRS because the
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.960]  Republican leadership is just as scared or more so of the Tea Party than the
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.200]  Democrats are every time it leaks at a Joe Biden meeting or a Boehner meeting
[46:30.200 --> 46:35.520]  they are freaking out over the Tea Party and they've got to bring it down
[46:35.520 --> 46:40.240]  because it's got the light of liberty in its heart and that's why it's so
[46:40.240 --> 46:46.360]  universally decried this is what the Fox News guest said when you have 71% who
[46:46.360 --> 46:51.160]  want an investigation 64% who believe it's a sign of corruption including
[46:51.160 --> 46:54.760]  nearly a majority of Democrats the reason is the establishment Republicans
[46:54.760 --> 46:57.840]  want the IRS to go over the Tea Party got it they want them to go out the Tea
[46:57.840 --> 47:01.080]  Party because the Tea Parties are an outside threat to their power hold and
[47:01.080 --> 47:04.880]  I'm telling you the lobbying consulting class of the Republican Party the
[47:04.880 --> 47:08.600]  Republican leadership who have been attacking the Tea Party and alienating
[47:08.600 --> 47:12.280]  them they want the IRS to do this
[47:12.280 --> 47:16.960]  back go ahead and just get that video that's so truthful you have it right now
[47:16.960 --> 47:21.760]  let's let's go ahead and play this veritas when you have 71% who want an
[47:21.760 --> 47:27.680]  investigation 64% of believe that it is a sign of corruption including nearly a
[47:27.680 --> 47:33.200]  majority of them are the reason is the establishment Republicans want the IRS
[47:33.200 --> 47:37.720]  to go after the Tea Parties got it they want to go after the Tea Party because
[47:37.720 --> 47:42.960]  the Tea Parties are a outside threat to their power hold and I'm telling you the
[47:42.960 --> 47:47.360]  lobbying consulting class of the Republican Party and Republican leadership
[47:47.360 --> 47:51.960]  who has been who have been attacking the Tea Parties and alienating them they
[47:51.960 --> 47:57.400]  want the IRS to do this and worse the IRS man that is so truthful that is so
[47:57.400 --> 48:01.720]  incredible and and by the way this is how Liberty works I want to explain
[48:01.720 --> 48:06.000]  something when you show courage when I show courage or somebody like Matt
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.040]  drudge of drudgereport.com shows courage when World Net Daily shows
[48:10.040 --> 48:14.520]  courage when a local talk show hosts shows courage when a Democrat shows
[48:14.520 --> 48:19.000]  courage and speaks out against Obama and the IRS when anybody stands up and
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.200]  tells the truth it brings more light into the world and then that enables
[48:22.200 --> 48:26.040]  other people to tell the truth and to see what's going on and to join you and
[48:26.040 --> 48:31.400]  then you take over with the Bill of Rights and Constitution and a great
[48:31.400 --> 48:36.960]  example of this is we got a break is out of Time magazine on Friday Valentine's
[48:36.960 --> 48:41.840]  Day children exposed to more brain harming chemicals than ever before a
[48:41.840 --> 48:45.800]  new report finds the number of chemicals contributing to brain disorders in
[48:45.800 --> 48:53.200]  children has doubled since 2006 doubled and it goes on to admit the number one
[48:53.200 --> 48:58.240]  thing is fluoride in the water and they admit Harvard and other studies
[48:58.240 --> 49:08.640]  showing IQ reduction in children that drink Florida water now that is
[49:08.640 --> 49:16.360]  absolutely incredible out of Time magazine and then they go on to list
[49:16.360 --> 49:22.640]  that it's causing increased aggressive behaviors mental illness fluoride
[49:22.640 --> 49:28.520]  causing quote drop in average IQ it just goes on now again I want to bring
[49:28.520 --> 49:31.800]  this to the mayor that laughs at us when we have like top toxicologist major
[49:31.800 --> 49:36.200]  professors come in and brain scientists neurologist and we go here on the side
[49:36.200 --> 49:39.720]  of it reports one part per million lowers IQ and causes dental
[49:39.720 --> 49:44.440]  phorosis and also causes bone degeneration and a seven-fold increase in
[49:44.440 --> 49:48.560]  bone cancer in men and they just goes you know what I don't have time to hear
[49:48.560 --> 49:54.720]  this gets up laughs and walks off the stage every time well they've got a
[49:54.720 --> 50:04.240]  laughed it's a con game oh yeah right because because they know folks this is
[50:04.240 --> 50:11.000]  all their big joke the political class of Democrats especially they know full
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.160]  well the fluorides there to dumb you down they're laughing at you cuz they're
[50:15.160 --> 50:21.600]  not taking it out unless you take them out politically
[50:21.600 --> 50:26.880]  believe me I know these Democrats especially these are evil social
[50:26.880 --> 50:31.400]  engineers folks they know what they're doing they enjoy what they're doing they
[50:31.400 --> 50:37.000]  think it's funny but even Time magazine now there's so much pressure and so much
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.840]  awakening has to admit this and it's gonna get worse for the establishment
[50:41.840 --> 50:50.400]  because here's the deal the 99.9999999% of us don't want to be slaves and you
[50:50.400 --> 50:54.440]  want to make it about 1% how about we make it about you the 6,000 globalists
[50:54.440 --> 50:58.320]  and what you're up to because the truth is getting out and more people are gonna

[54:05.520 --> 54:12.120]  radio network well I've known Matt Pearson for a couple years you've seen
[54:12.120 --> 54:16.160]  him in some of the gun shows we've done primfold works nightly news with Shane
[54:16.160 --> 54:20.240]  and Sid Steiner my high school buddies and he's the head chef over at the
[54:20.240 --> 54:23.400]  Steiner steakhouse I love getting out there when I can to eat one of his
[54:23.400 --> 54:27.360]  rib-eyes vest out there period but that's not why he joins us in this
[54:27.360 --> 54:32.360]  segment the next Matt sent me a text this morning saying I was listening to
[54:32.360 --> 54:36.280]  show yesterday where I was talking about the article it's up on info wars com
[54:36.280 --> 54:41.880]  that drudge carried on Friday breaking US Army trains for martial law in US and
[54:41.880 --> 54:46.320]  we have all the links in the story where they admit it's for the Tea Party gun
[54:46.320 --> 54:49.880]  owners you name it and then they admit other drills and other states were
[54:49.880 --> 54:53.680]  quote the scenario is gun owners attack the city because their guns have been
[54:53.680 --> 54:56.840]  banned so they're getting ready to ban guns start a civil war that's
[54:56.840 --> 55:00.880]  undoubted this is treason this should be the top story I'm trying to force it
[55:00.880 --> 55:04.800]  out there so that we can have a national debate about it but he was a heavy
[55:04.800 --> 55:08.400]  machine gunner in the army for many years before he got out and went to
[55:08.400 --> 55:12.800]  chef school so I wanted to get Matt Pearson did a lot of mount training he
[55:12.800 --> 55:16.400]  offered to come on and just give his take on this story and the difference
[55:16.400 --> 55:20.320]  because people are like well you need to train for urban warfare yeah they have
[55:20.320 --> 55:25.560]  facilities for that this is for America to acclimate go ahead Matt tell us your
[55:25.560 --> 55:33.800]  take on this yeah you know the army has mouths like this the dozens of them all
[55:33.800 --> 55:36.720]  over the place and they've got them pretty much every different scenario
[55:36.720 --> 55:43.400]  out there I know that I did one in Fort and Fort Sherman Panama it was a
[55:43.400 --> 55:49.160]  general jungle warfare training facility and I guess it's probably the one
[55:49.160 --> 55:54.640]  that's the most well-known and in the states is it Fort Polk Louisiana it's
[55:54.640 --> 55:58.880]  called the sugar Gordon complex and that's a big fake built city where we
[55:58.880 --> 56:03.160]  actually did drill that involved an opposing force that was the soldiers
[56:03.160 --> 56:08.520]  that was it were stationed at Fort Polk basically played the enemy and then we
[56:08.520 --> 56:11.560]  actually had some of their soldiers that would walk around like civilians to
[56:11.560 --> 56:14.880]  kind of create a real-time scenario where you would have to you know watch
[56:14.880 --> 56:18.840]  your fire to make sure you weren't taking out innocence and you know they
[56:18.840 --> 56:26.560]  range and for complexity to anything from just walls being built up with
[56:26.560 --> 56:31.560]  windows and doors so you can kind of learn to maneuver in and out it's actual
[56:31.560 --> 56:35.320]  standing buildings but the one that they've built this one in Virginia I
[56:35.320 --> 56:39.800]  mean this thing looks like a city it's full-out buildings looks like it's got
[56:39.800 --> 56:44.280]  running water and and churches and a football stadium and everything else so
[56:44.280 --> 56:48.240]  this one this one's built up like nothing I've overseen but I've kind of been
[56:48.240 --> 56:51.880]  reading up about it and they're saying that it's been in the plans for quite
[56:51.880 --> 56:58.080]  some time and I guess this thing right here looks like they're gonna be doing
[56:58.080 --> 57:04.400]  some pretty serious stuff in it but at the same time you know the Army is
[57:04.400 --> 57:09.000]  always changing situations like this but the one that really kind of sticks out
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.640]  is this one that just happened where they've talked about going after second
[57:12.640 --> 57:16.200]  amendment supporters this is the one that's kind of yeah you're talking about
[57:16.200 --> 57:20.640]  of Ohio story last week sure that's the main drill now we just report it when
[57:20.640 --> 57:24.240]  it's in the news their training Matt the main enemy is now Christians
[57:24.240 --> 57:27.600]  conservatives gun owners look at that colonel that wrote for Esquire saying
[57:27.600 --> 57:33.360]  you know they're coming after us right yeah I've never the one thing I can
[57:33.360 --> 57:37.960]  honestly say is I've never in my wife heard but when I was then ever heard of
[57:37.960 --> 57:42.680]  anybody training to fight against Americans or singling out a special
[57:42.680 --> 57:46.600]  group like second amendment enthusiasts I mean that's like you said it's
[57:46.600 --> 57:50.320]  treason that's not training that's treason well that's what we call the
[57:50.320 --> 57:54.720]  peace yeah training for treason it's so outrageous that they're really doing it
[57:54.720 --> 57:57.840]  did you see the thing out of Fort Hood a few months ago where they said that
[57:57.840 --> 58:04.600]  any anybody in the Tea Party would be court-martialed no I didn't see that but
[58:04.600 --> 58:11.480]  that that's not something you know no I haven't read anything about that what's
[58:11.480 --> 58:15.640]  your bottom line on this what do you think's going on well I mean I get I
[58:15.640 --> 58:18.560]  definitely think it's something to be watched but what really concerns me is
[58:18.560 --> 58:24.200]  number one being a veteran you know we were we were labeled as teacher domestic
[58:24.200 --> 58:29.160]  terrorist by Nancy Nancy Pelosi a while back and that's probably that probably
[58:29.160 --> 58:33.000]  just me off more than anything I've ever heard I mean I can't understand why
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.840]  anybody would want to call any of the people that volunteer tell us stay there
[58:36.840 --> 58:41.480]  mad back in one minute I want you to finish that point thank you for

[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.280]  alex jones
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.760]  well put it up on screen last year after we first broke it Fox News reported
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.800]  that evangelicals were labeled as terrorist and then anybody was part of
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.440]  the Tea Party was basically a terrorist Matt was just telling me that he talked
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.560]  to one of his buddies at Fort Hood and he was saying they got a memo saying don't
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.520]  visit the drudge report Matt repeat what you just told me we were bringing up
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.720]  because you did a lot of mountain training your ears as a heavy machine
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:52.480]  gunner in the army but Matt you Matt Pearson you were getting into the fact
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.240]  of the fact that Nancy Pelosi and Big Sis and Apollo Tano elisting returning
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.600]  veterans is the number one terror threat I mean this is the branding of us as the
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.080]  new enemy and in these army videos where they talk about the new asymmetrical
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.760]  warfare center this new city they say well we're preparing for what we think
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:13.280]  the next threat is so then they're getting ready for the next war west point
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.520]  as training manuals now or they say the next war will be with the Tea Party I
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:24.320]  mean this is crazy Matt go ahead yeah yeah well to get back on point I was
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.560]  talking about about I just it seems to me that they're really trying to paint
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.760]  veterans and soldiers as bad guys that maybe kind of sway the public's opinion
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.640]  on them I mean I think that that's pretty big crappy to call so many of the
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.760]  volunteers that serve for the country and that's what we have we have a
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.600]  volunteer volunteer military nobody we don't have a draft going on right now
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.640]  we don't have a situation like in other countries where you're pretty much you're
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.720]  required to serve two years I know there's a lot of those countries in
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.160]  South America and like even when I was in Korea those guys they have to serve
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.760]  two years they graduate price will be going in the military whether you like
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.160]  it or not I like that here we all volunteer to go serve our country and
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.840]  we do that because we're proud and we're American and it's in our family and
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.040]  it's our bloodline but my dad was a Vietnam but you know there was no
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.440]  question what I was gonna do when I get when I got out of high school I knew
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:18.520]  where I was gonna go so to do that and then to have something back call you a
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.200]  terrorist man that kind of pulls on the heartstrings a little bit and then you
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.920]  have all these little all these little stories coming out about how you know
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.920]  well so-and-so veterans have PTSD they need to have their guns taken away and
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.440]  then on top of that now you have all these stories breaking about how
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.880]  Americans are you know soldiers are trained to fight Americans it seems to
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.680]  me like what they're basically trying to do is paint a picture saying the troops
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.720]  aren't the good guys anymore wouldn't and that's not that's not the truth at
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.040]  all whatsoever though I agree with you it's a very sophisticated style but it's
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.480]  like the federal training to make cops do bad things and then it demonizes the
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.200]  police which drives them into the hands of the feds they want to use the troops
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.200]  while they're in and then have them demonize once they're out and they're
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.720]  going to autonomous vehicles now they're getting rid of the humans the next ten
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.600]  years and so that's what this is all about is phasing out the men period and
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.800]  and it shows that they'd like to stage some events and try to use the military
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.200]  against the American people I just don't see that ever working Matt no that's
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.480]  never gonna work that's not gonna work in it but it's like you said they are
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:28.880]  trying to phase out people get a robotic military style army because you know I
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.600]  guess that the army is made up of your you know people that are your brothers
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.680]  your mom your dad your cousins your friends hey briefly tell me about your
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.280]  buddy at Fort Hood talking about they got a memo about don't visit certain
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.680]  websites yeah there was a memo that came out a while back and it's like you were
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:48.000]  saying about the court marshaling for for being being a tea party contributor but
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.800]  yeah it was the same way don't be calling drug reports website don't be caught
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.680]  on the Alex Jones show stuff like that you know that they're kind of cracking
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.800]  down on stuff like that the thing about that is when you sign them when you sign
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.280]  your name and you join the military you do kind of give some of your rights that's
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.840]  that's just the way it goes no I understand but but it's like saying
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.360]  don't read the New York Times I mean it's not like they're saying don't read
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.000]  North Korean propaganda I mean of course you know they've been doing that to me
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.920]  for over a decade all that did was get the military to be our biggest audience
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.720]  early on because you tell them don't go visit this website I mean what's gonna
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:29.000]  happen exactly exactly and the thing is I just don't I don't see our military ever
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.680]  attacking this the citizenry of America that's just not that's not that's not
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.680]  terrible they're not they're not gonna do that that's that's what they say sign
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.320]  to protect the Constitution not the president or some jacked up agenda but
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.880]  you know if I had to get and I mean I I mean I'm looking at the pictures of this
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.720]  new mouth site in Virginia it's not even a mouth site at the city if you had to
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.000]  guess real quick what's that if you had to guess real quick what Jim what do you
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.360]  think I personally believe that we're gonna find ourselves in a deep series hold

[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:34.520]  Michael Maloof of world at daily.com WND.com gonna be joining us here in
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:39.160]  just a moment the next 45 minutes then I'll continue with news and we have the
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.160]  lead singer of corn joining us via video Skype he's been putting out videos
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.880]  critical of the Lord and Savior Obama and as Jamie Foxx calls him that's a big
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.600]  deal to have a major rock man doing that because you're not supposed to
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:58.880]  criticize the dear leader if you're in entertainment especially or you get
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.040]  persecuted as we look forward to talking to him finishing up with my friend Matt
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:07.400]  Pearson we did a lot of mount training and was involved in that in the army he
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:11.440]  was giving us his take on this Virginia Center that has churches you name it
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:17.000]  hundred million dollars to build it and it's it's got you know DC signs and it's
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.440]  clearly for ever warfare in the US it's this new mission for quote domestic
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.200]  terrorists which they say are the Tea Party but he had another wrinkle to it
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.760]  in closing Matt tell us well I was just saying there's a bunch of different
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.760]  reasons why they could have it you know the number one reason being where you're
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.760]  gonna train is where you want to be the most realistic for what's at hand and I
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:42.600]  think that really the most serious problem I think that we could have on
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:47.240]  our soil right now is the fact that we don't have any border security along the
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.640]  Mexican border and we have a problem with drug cartels and I have a feeling
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.720]  that's probably gonna end up surfacing pretty soon you know I'm nothing but a
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:01.080]  glorified pride but if I can see the problem with it it probably knows
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.520]  about it too and I have a feeling you know with everything that's going on
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:09.880]  with legalizing pot and that's been on cartels business you know toes on pretty
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:14.400]  soon we're gonna start having issues with it I got a buddy that's a APD drug
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.000]  task force he said there's someone on different cartel stash houses every day
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.760]  trying to do low-level marijuana bus so I'm hoping that that's what it's for
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.600]  because like I said I don't ever see the military taking up arms to get to some
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.240]  people in my lifetime I don't see that happening all right well thank you so
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.840]  much Matt we'll talk to you more soon you too there goes Matt Pearson giving
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:42.240]  us his take on that unfortunately if the political class is able to they will
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.640]  have the military as a domestic police force they're getting rid of Posse
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:49.600]  commentatus their main mission we broke this six years ago it's now mainstream
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:56.320]  news is to quote deal with the number one terror threat which the establishment
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:05.680]  openly states is returning veterans gun owners Christians conservatives the
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:13.360]  list goes on and on and so this is going on and it's a real crisis and yes the
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.960]  phony drug war certainly contributed to all of this destabilization as well I
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.560]  mean here's the Fox News article does the army consider Christians Tea Party a
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.600]  terror threat and in the memos it said do not be part of the Tea Party or you
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.040]  might get court-martialed don't be an evangelical this is outrageous what
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:36.560]  you'd expect from a Soviet military command and this is the facts now
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.120]  joining us for the most of the hour is Michael Maloof senior staff writer
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.120]  world net daily specializing in international political and economic
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.920]  analysis a former senior security advisor analyst for the office of the
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.800]  secretary defense Maloof was almost 30 years of federal service 23 years with
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.040]  the US Department of Defense and I'm not going to go over his entire bio but
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.720]  it's it's very interesting director of technology security operations involved
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:07.320]  in halting the diversion of military critical technologies to countries of
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.960]  national security and proliferation concerns those involved in sponsoring
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.960]  terrorism he's also advanced firearms training and combat tracking training in
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:20.880]  US Marines and has a background extensive protection and following 2011
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:27.480]  2001 attacks Maloof has also been focusing more and more on terrorism but
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:33.600]  he's got a new book out right now a nation forsaken EMP the escalating
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.960]  threat of an American catastrophe published by world net daily books
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.480]  available on amazon.com and bookstores everywhere and this EMP situation is a
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:49.320]  real deal because you could have even a country that doesn't have a high tech
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:53.760]  weapon system to try to get one of these over here or you could have of the sun
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.400]  mimic what an atomic or nuclear EMP could do I mean he's the expert and we'll
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:05.400]  get mr. Maloof to break it all down my issue is is that there's from what I've
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.520]  seen in Congress they finally have had some hearings on this but there doesn't
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.320]  seem to be the focus there should be instead we see an obsession with gun
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.920]  owners in all this new military training in the news supposedly the
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.760]  military is being taught that the gun owners and tea partiers are the new
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:29.040]  domestic threat not the Iranians not the Mexican drug cartels but the tea
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.440]  party or so before we get into your book and EMP I wanted to just in this
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.120]  segment the time we've got left mr. Maloof I wanted to get your take on the
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.960]  open demonization of the tea party returning veterans the attempt to shift
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.800]  the whole military industrial complex in domestically I guess into Obama's
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.680]  domestic security force he talks so much about you don't tell that with the
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.120]  purge of the military that's undoubtedly going on that all these top
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:58.680]  generals have spoken to you and others about at worldnetdaily.com I'm trying
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:02.960]  to get the big picture here from your perspective what do you think's going on
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.400]  here because we used to get documents five six years ago where the military
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.480]  was training to take on the tea party and people couldn't even believe they
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:13.880]  were real now it's just all over news like it's a good thing why the new
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.280]  threat isn't Al Qaeda it's the veteran next door he's gonna bomb the police
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.840]  department anytime now now what do you think's going on well first of all
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:28.520]  thanks for having me I just got off the phone with a very with a on-duty
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:35.280]  officer whose name will remain anonymous and he's very concerned about this and
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:41.480]  what and our in our discussion it really encapsulated what is going on he
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:48.960]  he said any dissent but within within the ranks today is tantamount to you
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:53.560]  being purged yourself or your your performance is downrated and that you're
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:58.760]  you're out you're out of the service the the problem that is occurring isn't by
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:05.200]  making a more compliant military well and and purposely doing this in order to
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:10.440]  make us more acceptable it on the world scene and not appearing to be the bad
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:20.280]  asses on the scene in the world it has made us become more of a less able to
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.880]  carry out national security responsibilities and that's a consequence
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:32.400]  we're cutting back tremendously in our military today and and as a result it is
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:41.400]  prompting countries such as China and Russia and other would want to be super
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:47.520]  power one of these to fill that to fill that power vacuum around the world and
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.000]  what we're seeing is that as a result with countries such as Japan Korea
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.560]  countries that we have alliances with them and to protect are saying well we
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:02.240]  can no longer trust the United States to protect us and we're going to go we're
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.960]  going to go our own way and as a result I then go in their own way with Japan and
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:13.040]  and and Korea for example with the industrial capability to go nuclear and
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.320]  to build up their own military independent of our protection it creates a
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:24.000]  more dangerous environment worldwide as a result and so this is what this is
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.160]  going to be the consequence of what we're seeing they can no longer rely upon
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.720]  us and the protection we've been given them and and and then and which which
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.040]  has actually helped us about in terms of our national security and it's creating
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:41.640]  for a more unstable world as a result and so you're saying as people are
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.200]  afraid to even ask questions or say anything a bunch of robots and then
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.440]  basically morale falls apart and then everybody just basically sits in a
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:57.200]  corner and just salutes the dear leader well as they go as they go up in the
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.120]  in the political as they go up in the officer corps approaching Colonel
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.880]  General and what have you it becomes much more political and as a result they're
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.440]  gonna they're just gonna stand up and so and that's just gonna wait and that's
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.320]  how they're going to be able to succeed it becomes much more politicized the
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.080]  officer corps has become much more politicized because they want to they
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:25.080]  want to be able to please the dear leader and be able to advance as a
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:31.800]  consequence but what does it create for it it creates a a hollow fighting force
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.960]  as a consequence along with other issues that are that have been brought into the
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.440]  let me throw a curb balay and they're gonna come back and get into your book in
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.560]  the big issue what do you make of the peace deals with Iran and I'm all for
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:50.240]  not having a war with Iran and Syria but then Iran has their top generals say
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.560]  we have sleeper cells in the US and I went and checked it he actually said
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:58.720]  that and then they send ships over why would they engage in provocations when
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:02.200]  they started getting what they wanted because they've read what I just said
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.000]  they read that we're weak we're not gonna do anything just like the
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.640]  United States didn't do anything towards Syria and and and Obama has made
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.360]  the made the point that we're going to negotiate as a consequence the the
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:19.800]  leadership in in terror have read those tea leaves and they see that we're not
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.800]  going to do anything as a consequence and so they're going to fill that back
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.400]  in plus you got to keep in mind this is all coming up on the what is it the
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:34.920]  2035th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution was in 1979 so
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:40.040]  there's a lot of bravado that is that is going on right now as well but we but
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:46.440]  you're right we've seen the expressions of this in the in the past a few weeks
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:51.000]  in which they're they're they're threatening and even though they're
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.400]  trying to get us to convince us that we need to lessen sanctions and to open
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:02.920]  up to them and and again it's just for posturing purposes and the United
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.320]  States doesn't gonna do anything about it don't you think it's some level it
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.440]  could be a suckering Iran in I mean is Iran really stupid enough to think it's
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.720]  gonna help them to put ships off our coast well they go ahead and put the
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.760]  ships off the coast but again it's it's for show force it oh I know it's a
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:26.040]  complete joke I mean obviously it's a joke it's just why it just seems it's
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:31.000]  just crazy that's that's all I can say well they're going to do it they'll
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.880]  probably use countries in Latin America for basing but but again it's it's a
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.040]  show it's a show and they know the United States isn't going to do anything
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.840]  about it all right Michael Malou stay there we're gonna come back and get into
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.240]  your new book which I just got I haven't ready yet I can't wait to read it
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.960]  because the more I research this EMP threat is the real deal and we're gonna
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.600]  look at different angles and in how serious it could be and ways to protect
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:00.560]  against EMP straight ahead one of the senior writers at WorldNet Daily huge

[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:02.400]  Hi folks Alex Jones here with some important information I want to tell
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:06.560]  you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.480]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment frustrated
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.480]  with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:17.440]  sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take action a company run by
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:22.000]  Patriots for Patriots was born. My Patriots supply has never taken a loan
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.280]  or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution facilities and
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:30.920]  employ over 50 hard-working American men and women. It is rare to find companies
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:35.240]  who practice what they preach and that's why I stock my pantry with high
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:39.920]  quality storeable foods for my Patriots supply. Go to mypatriotsupply.com

[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:26.720]  Michael Malouf was not only a senior advisor at the Pentagon for more than
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.640]  two decades. He also worked at the U.S. Senate and Department of Defense.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.240]  Malouf was a special correspondent for the Detroit News, a reporter for the
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:41.360]  specialized newsletter U.S. News and World Report, and Washington correspondent
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.880]  for the Union leader in Manchester, New Hampshire. He is the author of the new
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:50.680]  book, A Nation Forsaken, EMP, The Escalating Threat of an American
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:55.120]  Catastrophe from WorldNet Daily Books. This is a short segment, Michael, long
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:01.200]  segment coming up, but you've got the floor. Let's break down the EMP threat,
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.360]  and I know most people understand what an EMP is, but maybe start at the
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:10.480]  beginning and break down what your book covers. Well, my book is called A Nation
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:17.080]  Forsaken because the federal government has failed to undertake on the
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:22.240]  national priority basis the action to harden our facilities against either a
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:27.760]  natural or a man-made electromagnetic pulse. An electromagnetic pulse is a
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:37.200]  supercharged form of energy from x-rays to gamma rays and to other forms of
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:45.280]  radio technologies that can actually knock out our
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.800]  national grid system and also by doing so affect our other critical
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.520]  infrastructures on which our modern society relies. I'm talking
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:00.800]  about life-saving infrastructures that we that we have come to know and expect
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:06.000]  in the day and age, such as our food delivery, telecommunication, our banking
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.640]  system. They're all predicated on the use of the electrical grid, and the
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.920]  electrical grid is very vulnerable today. There are three grids in the United
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:22.000]  States, Eastern, Western, and the Texas grid, and all of them are very vulnerable.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:30.640]  The Eastern grid handles 70% of the US population, so if a natural phenomenon
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:37.000]  from a solar flare, for example, were to hit, it would cause some very widespread
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:45.080]  damage that could actually have an impact for years. For example, NASA has
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.000]  suggested that it could cost upwards of two trillion dollars in the first year
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.360]  we had a direct hit from a solar flare, and we're in that cycle right now where
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.120]  we can expect these solar flers to hit. In addition, it would also
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:03.640]  affect about 90% of the US population, and we're talking about the
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:08.600]  urban population, and when I say effect, that means death and starvation. Also, it
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.960]  could affect the minimum of 350 of our large transformers, and we only have
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.680]  about 1,500 of them, and then they are almost impossible to
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:23.560]  replace on a normal basis. We don't even make them here. We have to
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:29.000]  get them from overseas, and so all of our critical infrastructures would be
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.160]  affected. There would be a cascading effect, even if a portion of the grid is
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.680]  knocked out. It will have a widespread effect across the nation in
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:43.480]  terms of our food delivery, our water delivery, just transportation, our
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:47.760]  automated control system. Everything that we just take for granted that runs
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:51.880]  automatically from our pumping stations to our banking system, that's all
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:56.760]  automated, but all those would be knocked out, and that's what we would be
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.960]  facing, and this is what now the man-made would be from a high altitude
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:08.320]  nuclear explosion, and nations with a missile and a nuclear device, and a
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:14.520]  will to wreak havoc can do that. You can also do it, I've read with a hot-air balloon, right?
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:20.520]  Theoretically, yeah, you could put an orbiting satellite. An
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:25.440]  orbiting satellite could be a bomb, and this is what we've now seen the
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:30.240]  North Koreans actually working on rather statuously, is orbiting,
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.920]  which means that they were successful in orbiting a satellite,
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.120]  and that satellite could actually be a nuclear device, and we know that they've
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.920]  been working on a smaller nuclear device, which was poo-pooed by our military, but
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:48.000]  in fact, it's actually a super EMP weapon that they're working on, according to
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.120]  my sources, which means it will emit greater gamma rays, which will have a
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:59.000]  far greater impact on our electrical grid in all of our electronic devices
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.120]  that are not protected. I just got off the phone with an
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:09.480]  Air Force guy, and he says, well, we're protected to a point, but from
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.920]  a nuclear explosion, he doubts very seriously that we would be, that our
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.960]  electronics, which have been protected somewhat from, let's say, a flare or a
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.360]  lightning strike, would be able to protect us from a nuclear
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:28.840]  explosion, which is the most intense that you can get. Now, you're the expert on
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:32.760]  this, but there were congressional hearings, I know, in the last few years,
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:37.920]  and I've seen numbers of 2 billion, 10 billion. How much would it cost to fix
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.040]  this, and then I want to expand into what it would look like if we got hit by a
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:47.400]  strong, natural, a stellar flare, or what would happen if there was a hydrogen
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:52.360]  bomb went off in the upper atmosphere. We're on the march, the empires on the
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:58.400]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:04.400]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.480]  on health care? Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:14.520]  highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease? It all comes
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:19.600]  down to one thing, we are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:24.720]  processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled with toxic poisons and
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:29.840]  big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design. We can turn the
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.920]  tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.720]  desperately needs. To learn more visit infowarshealth.com. The site is

[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:08.640]  toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:13.520]  ability of the American people. So why are the social engineers adding it to the
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:17.640]  water? Simple. Dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:21.760]  technocracy is feeding on. We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:26.080]  water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies. I am extremely
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:30.680]  excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLife fluoride shield formulation

[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:20.080]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:29.240]  resistance. It's Alex Jones. Michael Malouf, senior staff writer Royal Nint
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:34.080]  Daly high-level former office of Secretary of Defense analyst and
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:38.360]  advisor joins us to talk about EMP and what a serious threat it is but let's
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:44.160]  say we're not worried about some rogue corporation group. I ran North Korea
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:49.760]  firing an EMP. What about other groups doing it and then you've got the Sun
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:53.520]  involves and we know going back in the last hundred years there have been other
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:59.120]  EMP events that have melted telegraph wires you name it but but we haven't had
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:02.880]  a big event since we became fully industrialized the last 60 70 years. I
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:08.160]  know the Pentagon did some tests with EMP themselves back in the 60s with high
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:13.560]  altitude nuclear testing but undoubtedly the science is settled to use an
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:22.040]  Al Gore type phrase. The point is they know that EMP is a serious issue and I
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:27.720]  don't really see any time or energy being spent on it so so recap for us I'm
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:30.840]  going for memory here Michael. They've had congressional hearings the last
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.520]  few years. I know that they debate how much money it would cost to harden
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:38.880]  things. I see some news reports saying we're due for a big EMP naturally to
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:43.120]  occur from the Sun. I mean what's the bottom line on this and then what would
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:47.040]  it look like if we did see a lot of the power knocked out in the US. I've seen
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.320]  some research papers saying that we may never get the power back on for a long
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:56.520]  period of time and that we would see societal level collapse. Well everything
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:03.200]  you just said cited is correct. The scientists have concluded that
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.360]  EMP is a very viable threat whether natural or man-made and it can affect
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:14.800]  our very vulnerable electrical grid and electronic components. Everything that
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:20.400]  we rely upon and take for granted today in our highly industrialized
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.520]  society. While it's made us the greatest industrial power in the world it's also
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:29.960]  our Achilles heel and the bad guys know that and so you're going to you're
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:35.120]  going to probably see more instances of localized efforts by lone wolves that
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:39.960]  might want to undertake this research we saw in San Jose last year. I reported on
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:45.520]  it back in July of 2013 but it didn't resonate. I mean I was talking to a
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:51.800]  former CIA director James Wolsey and he made mention of this and nobody
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.800]  picked up on it and here you had something not as not exotic at all in
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.200]  which people were firing AK-47s into transformers to cause the coolants to
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.720]  knock down if you hit strategic transformers you knock out the coolant
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:10.800]  they keep those transformers so I mean it's gonna you're gonna have blackouts
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:16.480]  and it could take weeks and months to happen but if you have a large-scale
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:22.600]  high-altitude nuclear explosion or even a massive solar flare from a direct hit
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:29.200]  from the sun it could take years to recover and certainly many months and
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.400]  and it's only the latest assessments I've seen on what it would take to do
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:42.000]  this anywhere from maybe no more than 20 billion dollars at
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.520]  most 20 billion dollars to harden these facilities do you have any information
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.720]  on who they think might be behind the attack in California on those
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.480]  transformers or who would the shootout with the police by that nuclear power
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:59.160]  plant that just happened a few weeks ago I mean there is more and more weird
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:05.360]  stuff going on yeah well it had to be it's homegrown terrorism whether it's
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.800]  a defunded group or whether it was well in this case there were a group of
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:15.520]  people they found enough casing to suggest that there was more than one
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.840]  person involved in that it could be it could be it could be a trial run now
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:26.080]  this happened a day after as I recall it happened a day after the Boston Marathon
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:30.520]  bombing and we had there are a lot of Chechens in that area so is there a
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:35.920]  connection the FBI has supposedly been looking at these kinds of things whether
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:40.160]  the test run for something larger it's quite conceivable the fact that they're
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.880]  using AK-47 is indicative of someone who had to be familiar with that firearm
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:51.120]  and knows how it knows about its capabilities and and also and it could
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.080]  have been it could have been something as simple as an inside job because
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:02.640]  simply simply because the the the transformers are where they knew
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:06.880]  precisely where the lines work but the fiber optic lines don't lead it lead it
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:13.400]  into the substation in San Jose and they knew precisely where the 17 other
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.240]  transformers that were knocked out were located and knew precisely where to hit
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:22.880]  them there's something to that that cannot be overlooked but you're not
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:27.040]  hearing anything from our law enforcement authorities are supposed to be
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:30.240]  investigating this thing I think simply because they don't want to scare
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:35.760]  anybody you know if it was a foreign activity it could have been a cartel I
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.120]  don't know sure they don't want any foreign I was about to say cartels is
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:44.200]  who I would think that's a real group that's actually you know kills
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.920]  police all over Mexico and now they've been having some setbacks so you've
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:53.520]  seen them try to you know sabotage the police station LA you know that's a
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:58.120]  whole nother issue do you expect that drug war that hot war in Mexico to really
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:03.120]  pour across our border oh it's already it already has it and it's going it
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:09.440]  easily could because the drug cartels have been able to get into some of our
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.880]  largest metropolitan areas I live in Breston Virginia and we have MF 13
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:19.160]  right here right across the right across the way and in Herndon, Virginia and
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:25.600]  this is this is in right outside the nation's capital so they're in the
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:31.040]  big cities for sure and and certainly down along the border areas that and I
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.480]  think there was an episode recently where there was a major firefighting
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:39.200]  using 50 caliber machine guns hang grenades and our border patrol people
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.600]  had to basically shut down the border because out of concern that there was
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:46.440]  going to be overflowing into into it was an Arizona that it was going to be
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.400]  overflowing into Arizona itself so there was an alert by the local sheriff down
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:55.960]  there I did a story on it come to think about it and Michael let me let me shift
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.440]  gears and we'll get back into EMPs in the book a nation forsaken available at
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:07.200]  worldnetdaily.com WND.com looking at this just just a large geopolitical
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:13.080]  overview as you know one of the deputy secretaries of defense over in England
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.840]  or Ministry of Defense came out a few weeks ago and said there doesn't even
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:21.080]  seem to be a strategy with Obama and I see all these ambassadors they're
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:25.880]  appointing who brag I don't speak the language I don't know how any of this
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:30.920]  works and I don't care I mean what scares me is I'm just a radio talk show
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:35.200]  host doing this 19 years but when I see these politicians on C-SPAN Obama
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:38.480]  people they know less than I do about most the topics they're talking about
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:43.880]  and I'm not some know-it-all it seems like a very lazy elite that we've got in
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:47.840]  charge right now and I mean the Republican Party as well trying to
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:53.360]  commit suicide with the open border situation I mean are they trying to do
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.480]  us in like the old Roman Empire but I mean how would you describe the
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.040]  political climate because it just seems like it's really like rotten fruit or
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.800]  something well I don't think foreign policy is this administration's forte
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:13.480]  and so they're looking more domestically and and and and what we're doing
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.400]  internationally is reacting more to events rather than having any long-term
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:22.560]  strategy and this is this is actually hurting us then even when you look at
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.520]  the appointments that are being made at the and our ambassadorship we at least
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:35.840]  it is it is something that we we need to look more close to make sure they have
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.720]  at least visited the country and they know something about the country the
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:43.440]  civil service and the and the ambassadorship though they then from
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.040]  other countries like like the United Kingdom would have you are people people
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.840]  who have vast background and experience and what they're going to be covering
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:56.960]  and we we just don't do that we we have a we have a we have a foreign service
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.880]  that isn't in a number of other countries but what's happened is that the
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:08.120]  Obama administration has increased the percentage of representation with with
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:13.240]  the political appointees principally his donors into these high-level positions
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:16.480]  and they don't know anything about what they're doing it's just a step forward
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:21.040]  for them if there's no commitment no they don't have this burning desire to
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:24.400]  learn something about the country or did it to better view what's foreign
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.600]  policy and there's no strategy and I think that this is why you're seeing and
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:33.360]  hearing complaints from overseas that the United States just no longer has a
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.960]  strategy and that are standing as a world power is diminishing and and and
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:43.080]  it and the Obama administration doesn't seem to be doing anything to try to
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:47.880]  reverse that and that segues right back into EMP it's it's it's like if you care
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:52.200]  about things and you want to learn about the world you're a weirdo but if you
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.480]  want to run around and have you know Jay-Z or whatever to the White House and
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:00.520]  have a party oh that's so cool it's just it really is frightening to think
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:06.200]  about so much of the political class in this country I think you're smoking
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:11.520]  their own political propaganda well I think the I think you're right I think
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:18.160]  the problem is is that it's projecting a an image of the United States is weak
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.520]  and as a consequence other powers will are seeing that and they're going to take
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.720]  advantage of it and they are and they're they're taking full advantage the
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.560]  instant you would create that power vacuum political and military or
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:35.160]  economic power vacuum others are going to swoop right in and we're seeing that
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:40.360]  now with the Chinese just in a certain itself in Asia well with a lot of our
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:45.920]  traditional allies to the point where Japan and Korea no longer look upon the
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:50.400]  United States as a part of the as provided them that protective umbrella
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:53.880]  that they were promised years ago and so now they're going their own way they're
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:57.920]  going to be militarizing more certainly Japan is and they have the industrial
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:03.240]  capability to to go nuclear Japan and do it within six months I was about to say
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:07.160]  we all know the Japanese been doing secret stuff and the word is they've
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.320]  already got the weapons now they just have to put them in the in the missiles
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:14.280]  and Japan came out today I've got the article and said they're going to get
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.840]  they're looking to go ahead and go in nuclear or at least allowing the US to
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:21.560]  station weapons there that's how insecure they are right now are they
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.400]  very insecure plus you have a new mentality that's developing in the in
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:30.040]  the in the form of the current prime minister there are they in which he
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:35.160]  believes more in militarization more of a Japan is starting itself and what is
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:40.840]  this cause it's created more of a problem with between China and Japanese
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.800]  relations of the consequence and of course the rivalry and the hatred
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.440]  between those two countries goes back you know to the beginning of the 20th
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:55.440]  century if not if not earlier and Japan occupied China that's right the
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.840]  number of years well Michael Maloof the book Matt no it's true and then they had
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.000]  wars before that in the divine wind earn back those invasions a nation for
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.640]  sake and available at wnd.com and I look forward to talking to you again in the
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:16.880]  future I mean in closing am I correct in saying there is more interest in EMP
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.360]  now and there is some movement in Congress or is that wrong no there is
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:26.040]  some movement we've established an EMP coalition in which we're talking more
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:30.720]  about it where where there is more discussion about it certainly the
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:37.160]  pan of a episode to help bring EMP issues to the floor but there still needs
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.560]  to be a lot more done in Congress and certainly they're more concerned about
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.240]  cyber security than than they are about the effects of an EMP if you can guard
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:50.400]  against the EMP you can guard against a cyber attack and they're just not
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:53.680]  looking at that pain at this point they're not there yet and I doubt that
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.800]  we're going to get a get legislation passed in the Senate we might be able to
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.640]  get something passed in the House but that's problematic all right Michael
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:05.640]  thank you so much thank you very interesting interview as always smart
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:10.360]  guy here's what's happening we've got the lead singer of corn coming up he was
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.120]  gonna be on Friday but we can never get a Skype working can we get a Skype test
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:19.000]  of the days is it working today or the process it's kind of fun though the
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.560]  always with media people or entertainment folks it's always fun to get
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:25.520]  the the connections going but but I look forward to that love their new music
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.900]  video Jonathan Davis we want to reach out to all the great corn fans out there
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:34.920]  so that's scheduled for like 20 25 minutes at the start of the next hour so
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:39.080]  that's coming up now I have a mass ton of news I want to cover we're gonna do
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:43.440]  that after the break in that that segment the next little segment because
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:48.160]  it's not just a US ambassadors that need no experience FAA no experience
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.520]  necessary for air traffic controllers that's an actual quote that's not an
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:58.040]  onion headline that is a world that daily headline directly from the FAA.gov
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:04.080]  website you you cannot make this type of stuff up and the new technology allows
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:07.960]  for TV ads to target specific individuals and families told you that was
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.800]  coming we're gonna break down what that really means at least my perspective on
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:19.080]  it also dollar hits six weeks low weighed down by soft data and there is a
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:26.320]  story up on info wars dot com right now and we've gone on done similar reports
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:29.720]  to this I'm gonna send my reporters back out to do this so I want to point out
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:34.840]  folks don't know their basic rights and liberties kind of jaywalking type
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:40.760]  reports but video students fail to name any of the bill of rights this is a
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:44.840]  mark dice doing that shame on you American youth has no clue about their
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:49.760]  own freedoms yeah and we need to rebuke these youth as well when they don't know
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:55.280]  and it's important to name it and shame it highlighting how woefully out of
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:00.560]  touch the US freedoms and rights are with youth America is students at USC
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:04.320]  San Diego failed to name any of the bill of rights when questioned by activists
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:09.480]  mark dice and you name some of the bill of rights dice ask them el student dude I
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:16.280]  think I need to take clues clearly desperate to get away because he did
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:21.000]  not know any of them I'm cruising you right now we're gonna we're gonna play
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:27.280]  that after the front man for corn leaves us but it's up on info wars calm it's
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:32.320]  up on prison planet calm right now ladies and gentlemen briefly we've got
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:38.760]  some new items at made in 1776.com where you'll find the George Washington belt

[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:11.360]  control no experience no problem you too can be an air traffic controller
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:15.360]  guiding hundreds of thousands of flights from airport to airport across the
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:18.360]  country the federal aviation administration says the position offers
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:23.360]  an exciting challenging and rewarding aviation career qualifications are to
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:27.360]  be a US citizen be able to start training no later than your 31st birthday
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:31.360]  pass medical security and pre-employment test and have either a bachelor's

[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:43.360]  necessarily any experience in fact the agency specifically addresses that
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:47.360]  concern stating members the general public can apply for FAA air traffic
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:52.360]  controller special positions there's specific job vacancies announced by
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:56.360]  the USA jobs that do not require previous air traffic control experience
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:03.360]  isn't that just special here's another one new technology allows for TV ads to
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:09.360]  target specific individuals families and then it says that by tracking your
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:12.360]  previous viewing and what you do is the TVs are just computers I told you a
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:16.360]  decade ago they watch what you watch and then track you and sell that data
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:22.360]  I guess I said that 10 years ago I said that like in 1997 so excuse me
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:26.360]  14 15 16 17 years ago it's incredible how long this has been going on but now
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:30.360]  it's so ubiquitous in all the systems that they just throw in everyone's
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:34.360]  face John Kerry has come out and said climate change world's most fearsome
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:40.360]  weapon of mass destruction meanwhile he hundreds of thousands of pounds
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:45.360]  they're saying of CO2 traveling all over the world to promote all of this
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:49.360]  garbage which I say is great I mean what's what's wrong with carbon dioxide
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.360]  that plants breathe compared to all the other serious issues that are
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:58.360]  transpiring in fact here's just from his one trip he spends hundreds of thousands
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:02.360]  a year but his one trip carries generates 12 tons of CO2 on trip
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:06.360]  discussing climate change isn't that just special but again it's just all
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:13.360]  completely and totally propaganda when Obama says to Africans you can't have
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.360]  cars you can't have air conditioning for the earth it doesn't mean Obama's

[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:33.360]  moral authority and you watch MSNBC you're singing in it's all about how smart
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:37.360]  liberals are and how they've got more education on average well let me just
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:40.360]  tell you something I'm not saying college is all bad but it is a boondoggle for
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:45.360]  most people overpriced on record it's a business almost every billionaire
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:51.360]  worldwide didn't go to college I think out of all the billionaires in the US to
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:57.360]  finish college so so so being a billionaire generally college does preclude
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:00.360]  you from that because usually somebody who's gonna end up being worth a
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:06.360]  billion dollars is already too busy being successful by the time they're 18
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:11.360]  1920 to finish college or too passionate about what they're doing to
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.360]  literally go in and be taught and that's where to take an RTF at college and it
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:19.360]  was literally five-year-old level I already knew more about it than the
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:25.360]  professor who obviously couldn't get a job in RTF so they had a professor job
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:29.360]  and I'm and I'm sure there's some exceptions and I'm not knocking people
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:36.360]  that teach that I just for me it just it's unbelievable it's absolutely
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:41.360]  unbelievable to see this type of stuff did did Willie Nelson need to go to
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:46.360]  college to learn how to get into music now Willie Nelson when he was like
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:54.360]  seven years old his grandparents bought him out of a catalog a guitar is that
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:58.360]  trigger or is that a newer guitar but no triggers an old guitar but I ask him
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:02.360]  the point is that you know they they bought him one out of a catalog and he
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:09.360]  was into it and learned how to play so did but I know all people go into
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  college to learn music or you know go into college to learn film and the only
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:17.360]  way that's good is to go to an elite film school so that you learn the
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:22.360]  contacts so somebody in the film school is going to end up being successful
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:27.360]  they then give you a job all the big new films that are successful are just
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:32.360]  being shot in HD high-def with interesting scripts and for $100,000
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:36.360]  becoming incredibly successful there's either big mega blockbusters now or
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:39.360]  there's little tiny things end up being successful there's none of the
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:43.360]  middle ground in the whole fake entertainment deal and if you're taking
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:47.360]  an RTF at a college you're taking ten-year-old knowledge and you might as
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:52.360]  well you know go live in a trash can or something you know better chance
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:56.360]  learning how to make a film or be successful doing that all right folks
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:01.360]  we'll be right back on the other side with our special guest stay with us in

[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:15.360]  guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:20.360]  here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:25.360]  producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:31.360]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:35.360]  had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important

[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:25.360]  when we get in the town going straight to the train get the fuck out of my way
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:30.360]  looking at my thoughts I take my time coming off these spikes in my veins
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:34.360]  all our new questions about the National Security Agency's massive spy center
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:39.360]  and reconstruction in the desert of Utah once finished it'll be five times the size
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:45.360]  of the U.S. Capitol building
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:49.360]  again you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcast this is info wars live
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:53.360]  the music video you're watching if you're seeing us at prisonplanet.tv is
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:59.360]  spiked in my veins by the mega hit rock group corn corn dot com
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:03.360]  you want to go there and see the entire video in HD
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:07.360]  it's from their a new best-selling album just out the paradigm
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:10.360]  shifts and I've been a big fan of corn for a long time
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:13.360]  most people that like rock and roll or heavy metal obviously love corn
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:17.360]  because all their music across the board I tend to find to be excellent
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:22.360]  so many bands only have a few songs you like it's very few in my view like
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:26.360]  Metallica or mega death we're just you every one of them are excellent
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:30.360]  and corn is right up there with them but what I really admire about corn now
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:33.360]  I know they've always been somewhat political promoting liberty
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:37.360]  is that this is a very bold almost documentary
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:41.360]  this particular music video spiked in my veins
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:45.360]  because it is if you're a radio listener you got to go watch the video online
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:50.360]  it is exposing you know Justin Bieber and the whole pop psychology
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:55.360]  and Miley Cyrus and just all of it and how it all ties in
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.360]  to the overall police state that's expanding
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:03.360]  and with all the images that are taking place on the screen
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:07.360]  and if we can get you know top platinum groups
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:11.360]  like corn and so many others
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:15.360]  who've had the courage to speak out against the system to go public
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:19.360]  then it won't be as dangerous to do we can cause a total paradigm shift
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:22.360]  which is what their new album is called the paradigm shift where it's not about
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:26.360]  Republican or Democrat it's not about all this garbage it's about a one-party system
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:30.360]  we've got absolutely strong our future now enough of me giving my interpretation
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:34.360]  because I've never talked to him before except for saying hi to him on Skype
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:38.360]  Jonathan Davis is of course
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:42.360]  plays guitar as well but he joins us
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:46.360]  he's the lead singer and the front man for corn
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:50.360]  corn.com facebook is just corn twitter it's twitter.com
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:54.360]  youtube corn channel where you can see the video in full
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:58.360]  we were just playing a clip of and they join us or he joins us right now
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:02.360]  so Jonathan I really want to salute you I know you've always had courage
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:06.360]  but it's bold to have videos that have the dear leader on them
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:10.360]  our lord and savior Barack Obama
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:14.360]  yeah it's pretty crazy huh
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:18.360]  I know folks that are big entertainment they're all scared they don't like Bush either
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:22.360]  but they don't like what Obama's doing but they're scared to ever even criticize him
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:26.360]  anyway tell us about the video tell us why you made it and what's going on
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:30.360]  I just think well for a long time I've been into
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:34.360]  what's going on with our country I'm not necessarily considering myself a
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:38.360]  political person but over the years I've seen what's been going on
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:42.360]  and it's called to me that it's time to do something about what's going on with
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.360]  our country and the system and everything that's going on it seems really
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:50.360]  sad that everybody's so asleep and oblivious to the fact
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:54.360]  that the country is in media to
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:58.360]  I don't know capture people's
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:02.360]  attention or take away from the fact that you know what's going on with our country
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:06.360]  it really freaked me out when the whole Miley Cyrus thing was going on and
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:10.360]  when that went down you know Barack passed that new law that he could
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:14.360]  imprison anyone he wants he doesn't have to charge him he can keep there as long as he wants
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:18.360]  basically all our liberties are being taken away one by one and
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:22.360]  finally I feel like it's time I gotta do something and let
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:26.360]  these you know try and get as many people as we can to wake up and see what's really going on
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:30.360]  well I think you just said it and as Mark Twain first said
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:34.360]  in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated feared and scorned
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:38.360]  but in time when his cause succeeds the timid joined him because then it cost
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:42.360]  nothing to be a patriot and again I mean I watch your music video
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:46.360]  it exposes the entire system it covers it all
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:50.360]  and this threatens the power structure because if others
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:54.360]  begin to follow suit that's going to be it for their whole system
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.360]  I mean as you said it's a paradigm shift tell us about the paradigm shift
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:02.360]  I mean I think it's time for us
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:06.360]  as normal people to come up and fight against the powers of B
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:10.360]  I think this country was founded and based in the beginning and set up for us to have
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:14.360]  revolutions when you know we don't like our government and what our government
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:18.360]  has done and taken over and taken away all our privacy and you know all the things going on
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:22.360]  with the drones and everything I mean everything it's a scary time and I think
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:26.360]  that someone's got to do it in our position someone's got to you know speak out
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:30.360]  to the younger audience and let them know what's going on how to wake up and
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:34.360]  take back their privacy
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:38.360]  well when we think about the raping of our privacy I mean it's beyond 1984
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:42.360]  oh it is they're everywhere I mean look at it big brothers alive
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:46.360]  and well I mean you're looking at me on my camera phone I mean it wasn't about putting
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:50.360]  up cameras I think we already got the cameras everybody everywhere you can't tell me that
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:54.360]  there's no back doors for everybody to see you know the powers of B can see
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:58.360]  what we're doing and watch what we're doing at all times I'm not comfortable
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:02.360]  with that and I think it needs to go to get ready to build in that huge
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:06.360]  ass building for all the spine and it's just going to get worse and worse
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:10.360]  and I mean it's scary times brother
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.360]  right and it's totally illegal as well but they're just doing it and
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:18.360]  I noticed in your music video you show a bunch of the
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:22.360]  pop people up front and that was my interpretation but you just said it
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:26.360]  that they're using this to project and distract us with all this empty
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:30.360]  fluff while our basic freedoms are being drained away
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:34.360]  yeah that's exactly what's happening nobody cares what's going on around the closed doors
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:38.360]  when Obama makes all these crazy laws that take away more and more of our privacy and make
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:42.360]  all the dictator something's got to happen man it's got to stop
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:46.360]  well you just said it wow wow Obama becoming a
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.360]  dictator and then when he leaves the Republicans will have dictatorial power why do you think
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:54.360]  Obama is becoming a dictator give us your breakdown on that
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:58.360]  I mean I said it before I think he's the only one out of it
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:02.360]  I think that you know it just doesn't make sense the whole thing
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:06.360]  I mean the guy comes from out of nowhere he gets made president
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:10.360]  all this stuff starts happening I don't know it just didn't make sense to me
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:14.360]  I mean and to believe top it off I'm not really a political person
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:18.360]  I don't know much about it I'm just worried about my privacy and my children's privacy
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:22.360]  and you know this being America we're supposed to be landed free
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:26.360]  and it's becoming a police state this is crazy
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:30.360]  well no army can stop an idea whose time has come and you talk about a paradigm shift
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:34.360]  I'm seeing a paradigm shift
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:38.360]  but it's so exciting to see you and your tour and your music and your band
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:42.360]  promoting basic freedom that's a breath of fresh air tell us about your tour
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:46.360]  yeah we're going I leave today to go to New Zealand
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:50.360]  Australia and Singapore so I just go all over the world
[02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:54.360]  and do what we do and that's just rocking out
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:58.360]  having fun having kids come out and have a good time and if they get something
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:02.360]  if they take something away from that and see what's going on in the world
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:06.360]  really that'll be an art world just enough
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.360]  just to get things going because I really want something to happen this is ridiculous
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:14.360]  well what you're doing as a humble man
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:18.360]  saying I'm not really a political person it's the political people
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:22.360]  that are in the controlled paradigm it's the average person who's just been successful
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:26.360]  with their own art their own ideas their own businesses
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:30.360]  who has the real right to speak and say I don't want you stealing my data
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:34.360]  I don't want you violating my bill of rights I don't want you violating my constitution
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.360]  and it's going to be not just people like yourself or myself it's going to be the common person
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:42.360]  just saying no and removing their
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:46.360]  consent verbally that will bring the system down and I believe we
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:50.360]  are getting close to the paradigm shift why did you call the new album paradigm shift
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:54.360]  is it your attempt to help create the paradigm shift
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.360]  for us we called it that because there was a paradigm shift going on within our band
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:02.360]  our old guitar player come back he'd been gone for 10 years
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:06.360]  and everything started to shift for us but
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:10.360]  I can see where you can see that paradigm shift going on
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:14.360]  with us right now politically but for us
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:18.360]  that's the reason why we called it that was something that was a shift within our band
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:22.360]  what's the response of your huge fan base
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:26.360]  around the world the tens of millions of corn addicts out there
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:30.360]  what is their response been to you calling out the NSA calling out Obama
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:34.360]  calling out the republicans calling out the entire criminal regime
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:38.360]  I mean overall the fans have been saying
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:42.360]  you know giving us a tribute to you for having the balls to make a video like that
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.360]  the response has been overwhelming it's been really really good and it really feels good to see that
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:50.360]  kids are starting to understand this and starting to get it
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:54.360]  well for those that don't know the reason I really admire what you're doing is I happen to know a lot of big rock and roll
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:58.360]  people and other folks and Dave Mustains had the courage to go on air
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:02.360]  people like Billy Corrigan have had the courage to go on air and criticize the system
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.360]  and I happen to know that all those people end up getting some type of
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:10.360]  repercussion and I know so many other big people that are scared to
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:14.360]  even say anything even mild and the fact that it's called
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:18.360]  courage by your fans which it is courage in this
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:22.360]  world of tyranny as George Arwell said in a world of universal deceit telling
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:26.360]  the truth the revolutionary act it shows how far down the rabbit hole of tyranny we
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:30.360]  are that it is ballsy for you to have the will
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:34.360]  and your band to put out that put out that music video
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:38.360]  I guess it is I mean for us it was just we're having fun it's like
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:42.360]  let's really throw all this out there and see what happens you know because every time
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:46.360]  I've ever said anything about against Obama or any kind of done anything
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:50.360]  political like that I end up not being composed all this stuff
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:54.360]  it's so funny I have clips I've saved where like I called
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:58.360]  Obama when Ronnie Puppet or when he died
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:02.360]  oh a certain political or a presidential candidate
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:06.360]  all this stuff it's funny how you just say something like that and they get so much
[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:10.360]  coverage so hopefully this is going to help well it certainly is
[02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:14.360]  talking about the rest of the band
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:18.360]  I mean you all made the music you all contributed but who directed
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:22.360]  the video because it's so well done
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:26.360]  I don't even know the name I'm sorry
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:30.360]  it was collaborative then the whole group put it together
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:34.360]  collaborative we had this idea and it was really interesting
[02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:38.360]  it was the first time we did a video with big robot cameras and I kept tweeting that day
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:42.360]  I remember when cameras were run by human beings and it's pretty funny
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:46.360]  how our world's turning into just being observed with robots and that was one of the reasons
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:50.360]  we had those it was pretty cool
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:54.360]  sure a lot of times we end up finishing a video and we go now who directed this and nobody knows because it's all collaborative
[02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:58.360]  but that's when you put something really good out is when everybody just gets in there and
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:02.360]  suddenly it comes out but man I'm telling you you're leading the revolution
[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:06.360]  here and I'm sure you know that if we can get people in entertainment people
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:10.360]  in music that's why the system tries to keep you guys under a thumb to break out
[02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:14.360]  it's over for the establishment what do you see in the future
[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:18.360]  either outside of Illuminati control or if we don't defeat them
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:22.360]  I mean I don't know I don't know what's going to happen
[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:26.360]  but it's pretty insane that the world
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:30.360]  internationally in the world there's a lot of places that are
[02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:34.360]  rising up having revolutions because they don't like the government I just think it's time for us to follow suit
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:38.360]  well exactly if we had a republican in there doing this I'd want them
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:42.360]  impeached but because he supposedly has the moral high ground
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:46.360]  he's a liberal any criticism of him is basically like
[02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:50.360]  blasphemy or something I'm sorry Obama's not my god
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:54.360]  and I shouldn't have to worship him
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:58.360]  that's why we have this country
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:02.360]  now Jonathan Davis you know I can talk a lot but I want to give you
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:06.360]  in the five six minutes we have left a chance to basically take over the airwaves
[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:10.360]  and just anything you want to talk about anything in the world going on
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:14.360]  after this interview is over I know you're going to wish you would have said something so say it now
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:18.360]  I just want us to
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:22.360]  become the country you used to be I remember when I was a kid
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:26.360]  how amazing our country was
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:30.360]  and as I've grown up and watched things happen I just wanted to be
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:34.360]  like it used to be and like I said I don't
[02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:38.360]  I'm not really a political person I don't want to come off like I don't know what I'm talking about
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:42.360]  I just I really want to leave a world for my kids
[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:46.360]  to you know have the liberties and the privacy that this country would have bound it on
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:50.360]  so that being said that's just my goal
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:54.360]  and that's it just that's really it
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:58.360]  so you're standing up and you know what's happening
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:02.360]  is not good it's really that simple I mean that's why
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:06.360]  I say why isn't there a bigger revolution in this country they're illegally spying
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:10.360]  on everything we do why not live in glass houses I mean this we're being
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:14.360]  if you don't have privacy you don't have freedom you're a slave it's that simple
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:18.360]  it's really that simple nobody wants the government knowing what they're doing the government it's not
[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:22.360]  it's another business it's it's crazy
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:26.360]  this is happening well what would you do if you caught some neighbor climbing your fence looking in your
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:30.360]  window at night even if you're a nice guy and I'm a nice guy I would probably
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:34.360]  walk out and punch him in the face but then government is staring in our windows
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:38.360]  staring into our bedrooms everything we do and it's like well they're the government
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:42.360]  no no no it's even worse for them to do it historically
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:46.360]  yeah it's worse I mean they're I'm here in stories that they're starting to try to take our guns
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:50.360]  now there's all kinds of scary stuff going on
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:54.360]  it's it's sad bro
[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:58.360]  we need to get it together corn.com
[02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:02.360]  you know I haven't downloaded the entire record yet because I've been watching them on your youtube
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:06.360]  site but I gotta say out of all your records this one this one is one of the best
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:10.360]  how do you guys keep it so original because talking to other other big
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:14.360]  music talents they say that's the biggest thing it's easy to do one record two records
[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:18.360]  three really hard four super hard I mean is that true
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:22.360]  it gets harder each time I think it's harder each time if you
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:26.360]  don't experiment for us we've always tried to be innovators we've always
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:30.360]  tried to do something different from the last record and that's what keeps it fun for us
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:34.360]  so I think it's the will of the longevity of the band we've been around so long
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:38.360]  because we're constantly evolving and and and being artists I mean
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:42.360]  you don't want to do the same thing over and over again so I feel blessed
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:46.360]  to still be here after 20 years doing this well we gotta salute the rest
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:50.360]  of your band because I mean I'm sure they all had to agree to be part of this evil
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:54.360]  sacrilege this blasphemy of criticizing the dear leader so
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:58.360]  wow they sound like thought criminals like you
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:02.360]  all are right the world needs us
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:06.360]  they certainly do wow well when are you gonna be touring back in the
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:10.360]  United States I believe I'll be doing some shows when I get back
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:14.360]  in April I believe this when I'm getting some
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:18.360]  more shows and then we got some summer tour stuff like that but we're always
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:22.360]  constantly touring we don't stop alright well
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:26.360]  listen Jonathan Davis I really appreciate you spending
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:30.360]  so much time with us corn.com folks can find you at facebook.com
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.360]  forward slash corn twitter.com forward slash corn give us just
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.360]  closing thoughts on the place humanity is
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:42.360]  right now I think you've already said it though now's the time to stand up speak out or be
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:46.360]  slaves exactly there's no you can't
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:50.360]  change has to come and it's gonna be from the people
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:54.360]  and definitely this system we got right now it's not working so it's time to
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:58.360]  change it alright well I hope when you get back to
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:02.360]  the US sometime that we can get a chance to interview in studio or send a camera
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:06.360]  over to meet the rest of the crew thank you so much Jonathan Davis thank you Alex you're amazing
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:10.360]  man no no you guys are thank you so much you're welcome brother wow
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:14.360]  folks again ladies and gentlemen you don't know the
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:18.360]  courage it takes when you're in entertainment the whole system comes
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:22.360]  after you and I can't get into the stories because they're they're confidential
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:26.360]  but it's well known how they try to keep people on a short leash
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:30.360]  and I got a text message from a huge rock star
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:34.360]  just last week when I was talking about Hollywood and how they're waking up
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:38.360]  and he said you know you do not know how true that is Alex it's really happening
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:42.360]  so just keep talking about what's happening in Hollywood in the music industry
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:46.360]  because listen if the system loses Hollywood
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:50.360]  and loses the music people it's over
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:54.360]  I happen to know for a fact in country music they try to tell people be establishment now
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:58.360]  and promote Obama you've been seeing big country singers promote gun control now suddenly
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:02.360]  and they point blank tell them you're gonna get a bigger record deal we're gonna put you on
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:06.360]  Super Bowl we're gonna promote you if you promote Obama
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:10.360]  and again Republicans have done bad stuff too it's just never has it been
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:14.360]  like this where there's literal blacklist if you don't
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:18.360]  play ball and I mean they don't play you
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:22.360]  radio folks if you criticize Obama mildly
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:26.360]  date and corn is a group playing on the radio all the time
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:30.360]  and they're willing to put out a record
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:34.360]  an album dead center attacking Obama
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:38.360]  for being a globalist front man and wanting our guns I mean that's
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:42.360]  because the culture only cares about music and entertainment
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:46.360]  most people aren't focused on news the real battle
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:50.360]  is in music entertainment and I'd say about 20% of Hollywood
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:54.360]  are hardcore leftists who really believe what they're doing another 20-30%
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:58.360]  are establishment leftists that do it just like it's part of being in the club
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:02.360]  like being part of the Nazi party but you're not really a Nazi that happened in Germany
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:06.360]  most Nazis were not Nazis they just didn't want to get put in a labor camp
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:10.360]  and then you've got maybe 20-30% that are
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:14.360]  libertarian and then maybe 10-15% that are what you call mainline conservative
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:18.360]  but Hollywood goes after libertarians libertarianism is really
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:22.360]  out of all the groups the biggest one group in LA
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:26.360]  and Austin I mean I know folks I've been to all the A-list parties
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:30.360]  for whatever reason I was able to get into all that and I mean I didn't do it a lot
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:34.360]  but used to I got invited out to Los Angeles you know every
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:38.360]  month to be on TV shows and stuff well I just say no to those now
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:42.360]  just because you know you fly out there you spend three days
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:46.360]  they interview you twice you end up being on some TV show for two minutes about

[02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:16.360]  are the social engineers adding it to the water symbol dumb down the host
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:20.360]  population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have
[02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:24.360]  been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get

[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:23.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:36.360]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network Jonathan Davis frontman for corn was
[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:41.360]  just on with us and finishing up my statements on that getting into Hollywood
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:47.360]  90% of war is psychological you see how weaponized Hollywood is you see the
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:51.360]  anti-family anti-liberty propaganda but you're also seeing more and more
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:59.360]  pro-liberty information in so many movies so many films man of steel I had a
[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:04.360]  anti eugenics message a decentralization message I just went and saw a nut job
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:10.360]  it has an anti-21 message I went and saw a Lego movie extremely libertarian I'm
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:13.360]  not gonna give it away my son's gonna do a review soon I think he's gonna come in
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:17.360]  one day this week trying to get that all scheduled right now I mean it's just so
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:22.360]  many movies I go and see now actually have good messages and that's because I
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:26.360]  happen to know some of the people involved they are trying to sneak through
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:32.360]  what they can and as long as it's not too overt the old ruling elite of Hollywood
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:38.360]  won't shut them down plus pro-liberty type ideas sell more tickets doing the right
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:43.360]  thing actually pays historically that's what evil people don't get or those that
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:48.360]  sell out to evil evil people tend to get it they want to run it but when I say
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:53.360]  30 35% of how Hollywood is hardcore libertarian or conspiracy theorist is
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:58.360]  another way to say it my point is that's the growing political group if you're
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:02.360]  a Republican they go after you and destroy you everybody's sick of being a
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:07.360]  Democrat being under that thumb and the Democratic royalty Michael Moore and
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:13.360]  Matt Damon and you know just all of those people George Clooney and Sumner
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:21.360]  Redstone and just all of it people are sick of it and it's that close to
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:26.360]  collapsing oh that's very conservative numbers I've gone to Hollywood parties
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:31.360]  where everyone was aware of the New World Order and very upset about what's
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:36.360]  going on and most of them were listeners and talked my ear off about all these
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:42.360]  different you know quote conspiracies and questioning the system then I've been
[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:51.360]  to others were half the people are awake it's amazing but when you get in these
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:36:00.360]  really high level meetings they're just point blank about it only liberal
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:07.360]  politics is allowed here that's what we push and it is an entrance fee to the
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:11.360]  door and so Americans need to know that that's why when somebody like corn comes
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:17.360]  on or Dave Mustaine comes on or Billy Corrigan comes on or you know my friend
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:22.360]  Jimmy Vaughan years ago popping on the show he's just too shy to come on whoever
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:28.360]  that you have to know that there is a political price to pay well the price is
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:32.360]  way too big to pay if we don't turn this around and stop it and when the first few
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:40.360]  people start going public it will cause a domino effect
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:50.360]  but it's time for all these celebrities who are out there who can really affect
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:54.360]  change to show the world that Hollywood isn't a bunch of kleptocratic
[02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:58.360]  authoritarians that call themselves liberals it's time for you to show the
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:01.360]  world who you really are they're not gonna be able to shut down everybody I
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:06.360]  guarantee if you had 35 40 50% of Hollywood come out and say I'm a
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:11.360]  libertarian I'm a conspiracy theorist I'm a I'm a constitutionalist I'm a
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:14.360]  conservative they couldn't get rid of half the people there and that whole
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:19.360]  system is already beginning to collapse right now anyways that's another reason
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:24.360]  more of the truth is able to come out now so again it's another sign that the
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:29.360]  establishment is not all powerful and is not invincible so we salute Jonathan
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:37.360]  Davis and corn for their contribution overall to that and everyone else who
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:43.360]  wants to stand up against corruption and evil we need police officers military
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:49.360]  people school teachers lawyers bureaucrats farmers people that work in a
[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:54.360]  machine shop I don't care who you are secretaries all you are important the
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:58.360]  little things you do every day will change the world that's why they want you
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:02.360]  to just go on watch TV live in their false paradigm only repeat what they put
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:06.360]  out distract you from the whole universe of reality around you with a little
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:15.360]  vision box I'm here on television on a self-made people built platform that the
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:19.360]  system is trying to shut down right now they want us all lined up in little
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:23.360]  obama-noid uniforms and then when they bring out that puppet bring in some
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:27.360]  new puppet and we all line up and get into the next fad that is just a new
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:34.360]  tyrant dressed up in a different uniform and I know Obama's a puppet but he's
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:40.360]  the puppet who is the front man and and and the cult of personality around
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:45.360]  which the power structure has organized this entire system we have a
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:53.360]  desperately dumbed down population desperately desperately
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:39:04.360]  one in four new study out last week we covered doesn't know that the earth
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:10.360]  orbits the sun most people can't list any of the bill of rights on the street
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:15.360]  most people can't list the three branches of government that's a man on the
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:19.360]  street go out and get people to list the three branches of government and if they
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:24.360]  do we'll give them ten dollars and we'll give them a hundred dollars and they
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:30.360]  can list the legislative executive and judicial if they can say what each one
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:37.360]  of them's basic function is that means judicial is the courts executive is the
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:48.360]  presidency legislative is the congress maybe go out and give people a hundred
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:53.360]  dollars if they can tell you what the 10th and 9th amendment are this is
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:57.360]  basically the same thing the 9th amendment it's a super 10th amendment
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:01.360]  probably the most important of the the 9th amendment is like the declaration of
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:08.360]  independence recast speaking of people being desperately dumbed down here's
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:15.360]  Mark Dice's latest video that's up on info wars dot com students failed to name
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:21.360]  any of the bill of rights shame on you American youth has no clue about their
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:25.360]  own freedoms and I'll guarantee you these people are all super trendy
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:31.360]  Democrats look look it's just true Democrats are the dumbest most pack
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:36.360]  oriented mindless people I've ever run into that doesn't mean they're all idiots
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:40.360]  the higher level ones are predators feeding on people but these young people
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:45.360]  man they don't know how to change attire they don't know where electricity comes
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:50.360]  from they don't know they basically would walk in a grocery store and just
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:56.360]  think meat appears in plastic containers I mean I they had literally like
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:59.360]  gerbils that have had their eyes poked out their ears poked out their legs
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:04.360]  chopped off I mean they're just flopping around they can't even I mean it is it
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:09.360]  is unspeakable how helpless and dumb they are and how the system is doing
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:14.360]  everything it can to exacerbate I mean you watch this video I've told Mark on
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:19.360]  and off air it's time to say shame on you you're scum and he's finally doing it
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:24.360]  and that's good and and I got great reporters but I'm gonna I gave him a
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:30.360]  little pep talk today I said look I want you to go out just like we went out and
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:36.360]  did a piece on going abort people's children after they're born that didn't
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:39.360]  get picked up in the news but then a bunch of other universities and people did
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:43.360]  it and became a national story our job is to get other people to emulate our
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:48.360]  system of success just like Mark emulated me eight nine years ago we
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:53.360]  know emulate him success breeds success it's the same deal we don't
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:42:00.360]  territorialize taking down the new world order we all work together as we have
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:04.360]  no future if we don't do that and I want to see people all over the country go out
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:08.360]  and do your own man on the street and put it on the internet to shame these
