[00:00.000 --> 00:16.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones
[00:22.920 --> 00:27.320]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show filling in for Alex today. I'm Owen shroyer Paul Joseph Watson
[00:27.320 --> 00:34.340]  will be taking over soon in the second hour and if you want to talk about raw
[00:34.340 --> 00:42.720]  unmitigated arrogance you want to talk about feeling like you are truly above
[00:42.720 --> 00:49.160]  the rest of the population truly beyond reproach well you look at Hillary
[00:49.160 --> 00:54.240]  Clinton saying why aren't I 50 points ahead you look at James Comey and Peter
[00:54.240 --> 00:59.160]  stroke changing the terminology in the Hillary Clinton investigation so that
[00:59.160 --> 01:05.080]  she did not get indicted but this is something that seems to be infecting
[01:05.080 --> 01:10.760]  many Democrats if not all including Sheila Jackson Lee who apparently thinks
[01:10.760 --> 01:14.760]  she is the most important person to ever step foot on an airplane here's a
[01:14.760 --> 01:20.000]  report from John Bowne. Democratic representative Sheila Jackson Lee has
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.280]  had a career loaded with grandstanding half-truths blanketed racism and sheer
[01:25.280 --> 01:30.320]  hubris and frankly maybe I should offer a good thanks to the distinguished
[01:30.320 --> 01:37.240]  members of the majority the Republicans my chairman and others for giving us an
[01:37.240 --> 01:43.000]  opportunity to have a deliberative constitutional discussion that reinforces
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.360]  the sanctity of this nation and how well it is that we have lasted some 400
[01:49.360 --> 01:59.120]  years where we are right now has 42 statues showing you the moment of the
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.840]  signing of the US Constitution on September 17th 1787 operating under
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.280]  Constitution that clearly defines what is constitutional what is not he is
[02:09.280 --> 02:14.600]  incompatible with the office and the leadership of this country and yes the
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.600]  idea that his continuous assault on women only compiles the fact that I would
[02:20.600 --> 02:25.080]  ask him it's a job that he does not seemingly like he needs to resign this
[02:25.080 --> 02:30.000]  is a disgrace stop talking about foolishness be a leader and be the
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.800]  commander-in-chief and stop all of this when are we going to get the kind of
[02:33.800 --> 02:38.400]  leader that is deferring of the American people I am sick and tired of it I want a
[02:38.400 --> 02:53.680]  president general lady is no longer recognized members are reminded to
[02:53.680 --> 02:57.400]  refrain from engaging in personalities toward the president I've said the same
[02:57.400 --> 03:01.920]  thing as far as 10 years ago to the German people and any population of
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.520]  people that is a declining population that doesn't isn't willing to have
[03:05.520 --> 03:09.640]  enough babies to reproduce themselves and I've said to them you cannot rebuild
[03:09.640 --> 03:12.960]  your civilization with somebody else's babies you've got to keep your birth
[03:12.960 --> 03:18.080]  rate up this Western civilization still is a bit is a superior civilization
[03:18.080 --> 03:25.240]  congressman what are your thoughts about that casting aspersions on his so-called
[03:25.240 --> 03:33.160]  Western civilization it is a racist unbelievable statement that should not
[03:33.160 --> 03:37.600]  come out of the mouth of a member of the United States Congress I stand here as a
[03:37.600 --> 03:43.120]  freed slave because this Congress came together are we going to be able to do
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.600]  it today to free America I yield back now Lee's lunacy has reached a height
[03:48.600 --> 03:54.480]  that challenges common sense the Daily Caller reported Jean Marie Simon 63
[03:54.480 --> 03:59.080]  accused United Airlines on Twitter of bumping her from a December 18th flight
[03:59.080 --> 04:04.520]  from Houston to Washington DC in order to accommodate Lee Lee responded with an
[04:04.520 --> 04:09.600]  angry Twitter tirade of her own Tuesday accusing Simon of targeting her because
[04:09.600 --> 04:15.040]  of a race Lee wrote since this was not any fault of mine the way the individual
[04:15.040 --> 04:19.680]  continued to act appeared to be upon reflection because I was an African
[04:19.680 --> 04:23.920]  American seemingly an easy target along with the African American flight
[04:23.920 --> 04:29.440]  attendant who was very very nice Simon was on the last leg of her return trip
[04:29.440 --> 04:33.360]  from Guatemala when the incident occurred in fact she spent much of the
[04:33.360 --> 04:38.200]  1980s documenting war crimes there in the wake of a military coup that saw
[04:38.200 --> 04:42.560]  thousands murdered raped and starved she first traveled to Guatemala at the
[04:42.560 --> 04:48.280]  behest of Amnesty International Simon is designated as a hard-line demo right by
[04:48.280 --> 04:52.080]  the deep well you just heard it Sheila Jackson Lee swamp creature
[04:52.080 --> 04:58.040]  extraordinaire the louder they scream against Trump the harder they will fall
[04:58.040 --> 05:02.240]  fuel your body with carnivore the new digestive enzyme product by info war's
[05:02.240 --> 05:06.480]  life digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the
[05:06.480 --> 05:09.440]  bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily
[05:09.440 --> 05:13.200]  absorbable components they also help prevent discomfort from a digestion
[05:13.200 --> 05:17.120]  caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut digestive enzyme
[05:17.120 --> 05:20.840]  production declines as we age carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like
[05:20.840 --> 05:25.120]  those naturally present in the body enjoy the full potential of protein rich
[05:25.120 --> 05:29.600]  foods again you can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later
[05:29.600 --> 05:33.760]  indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets just
[05:33.760 --> 05:37.400]  one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and
[05:37.400 --> 05:42.320]  absorption of amino acids the building blocks to your muscles carnivore also
[05:42.320 --> 05:46.560]  contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can
[05:46.560 --> 05:51.000]  fully digest all types of meals don't let them you'll go to waste use carnivore

[06:19.960 --> 06:24.320]  boy I'll tell you a little global warming would sound pretty good right now
[06:24.320 --> 06:32.040]  wouldn't it funny how that works Al Gore can you believe Al Gore was the vice
[06:32.040 --> 06:39.360]  president I mean this guy is such a joke he predicted the polar ice cats would be
[06:39.360 --> 06:45.440]  completely melted by now how does a man that pathetic become the vice president
[06:45.440 --> 06:49.120]  welcome into the Alex Jones show filling in for Alex today Owen shroyer Paul
[06:49.120 --> 06:54.160]  Joseph Watson takes over in the second hour we got some news out here today
[06:54.160 --> 06:59.560]  of course global well not global but here in America we're gonna have some
[06:59.560 --> 07:03.760]  record low temperatures it looks like for New Year's Eve Al Gore completely
[07:03.760 --> 07:08.640]  embarrassed he's not choosing to make any statements you had a building in the
[07:08.640 --> 07:14.760]  Bronx gets set on fire or caught on fire yesterday they're saying it looked
[07:14.760 --> 07:19.440]  like it may have been a child playing with a stove I started to remember what
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.480]  happened in I think it was in England when that apartment building burned it
[07:24.480 --> 07:32.040]  was mostly inhabited by migrants and it still stands just like a a burned
[07:32.040 --> 07:37.560]  building just standing there a total eyesore you've got New Year's Eve
[07:37.560 --> 07:44.520]  security being ramped up because of threats of terror attacks it's so loving
[07:44.520 --> 07:49.840]  though it's so tolerant you should be tolerant of the open borders that lead
[07:49.840 --> 07:59.680]  to terrorism what's wrong with you you racist but perhaps more shocking than
[07:59.680 --> 08:05.720]  Al Gore being completely wrong with his predictions on global warming with this
[08:05.720 --> 08:09.640]  building that burned in New York City that I believe they said I think what
[08:09.640 --> 08:16.320]  12 dead perhaps the Trump derangement syndrome that we thought had reached
[08:16.320 --> 08:21.640]  peak insanity when they were literally screaming at the sky that was an event
[08:21.640 --> 08:24.560]  for them to protest Trump screaming at the sky you caught a little bit of
[08:24.560 --> 08:30.400]  Sheila Jackson Lee doing that in the last segment but how about this a
[08:30.400 --> 08:40.200]  protester has decided to protest Trump by going to Disney World and yelling at
[08:40.200 --> 08:47.200]  the robot Trump this is truly an unprecedented display of insanity
[08:47.200 --> 08:55.360]  here is that video of this moron protesting a robot that I took an oath
[08:55.360 --> 09:01.960]  35 simple words that have been repeated by every American president throughout
[09:01.960 --> 09:04.480]  history
[09:05.000 --> 09:13.200]  hi John lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up
[09:13.200 --> 09:19.000]  it's our chance for him lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.320]  notice how no one's joining along lock him up you chanted that in the halls of
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.880]  a Trump Rally of the entire halls were ringing with lock her up what to him up
[09:26.880 --> 09:51.760]  lock him up lock him up lock the robot
[09:51.760 --> 10:01.920]  I guess what this individual lacks in common sense and IQ he makes up for in stamina.
[10:01.920 --> 10:07.160]  So we give him credit for that, but you know, this is this is actually a pretty sad story
[10:07.160 --> 10:08.160]  here, folks.
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.080]  Now, I don't know what Sheila Jackson Lee, I don't know what her deal is.
[10:11.080 --> 10:15.540]  Is she a swamp creature that's freaked out because of the things that Trump is doing
[10:15.540 --> 10:16.540]  behind the scenes?
[10:16.540 --> 10:20.540]  Does she have her own crimes that she's hoping don't get exposed?
[10:20.540 --> 10:28.020]  Or is she truly just another one of these complete bumbling morons suffering from Trump
[10:28.020 --> 10:32.200]  derangement syndrome?
[10:32.200 --> 10:40.960]  It's really sad, it's really sad that this is what the propaganda news has done to individuals.
[10:40.960 --> 10:48.000]  It's really sad that people's souls are so sucked that they ignore all the evidence in
[10:48.000 --> 10:56.760]  front of their face and instead go with their emotions that are triggered by fake news.
[10:56.760 --> 11:04.860]  And so this individual, so brainwashed, so soul sucked, goes to Disney World to yell
[11:04.860 --> 11:09.600]  at a Trump robot.
[11:09.600 --> 11:13.500]  You can't make this stuff up.
[11:13.500 --> 11:20.280]  And I really don't know what you do with a person like that.
[11:20.280 --> 11:27.560]  Insane asylum, mental institution, you know, we shut a lot of those down in the 90s.
[11:27.560 --> 11:32.360]  Maybe it's time to reopen some of these mental institutions.
[11:32.360 --> 11:41.240]  If you're going to Disney World to shout at a robot, maybe there's something wrong with
[11:41.240 --> 11:42.760]  you.
[11:42.760 --> 11:48.520]  If you're Sheila Jackson Lee and you want to make a big scene of yourself on the floor
[11:48.520 --> 11:53.480]  of Congress and you want to make a big scene of yourself on an airplane because of your
[11:53.480 --> 12:02.160]  hubris, maybe there's something wrong with you.
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.560]  We've reached a lot of turning points in 2017.
[12:07.560 --> 12:13.080]  A lot of things where the genie can't be put back in the bottle.
[12:13.080 --> 12:17.760]  And I think another one of the things that we're going to see here in 2018 is just the
[12:17.760 --> 12:27.680]  continued of the Trump derangement syndrome, but perhaps even peak insanity levels, especially
[12:27.680 --> 12:33.400]  if Republicans gained seats in Congress in the 2018 midterms.
[12:33.400 --> 12:40.280]  Because just like these poor, soul-sucked, brainwashed zombies thought Hillary Clinton
[12:40.280 --> 12:47.920]  was going to win and thus they freaked out, they threw temper tantrums, they cried, they
[12:47.920 --> 12:55.960]  screamed at the sky, they still protest Trump, they believe fake news like Russian collusion.
[12:55.960 --> 13:00.480]  Just like all of that because of fake news saying Hillary Clinton was going to win,
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.640]  the same fake news is going to tell them that Democrats are going to take Congress.
[13:05.640 --> 13:11.840]  The Democrats are going to sweep the 2018 midterm elections and then their hopes are
[13:11.840 --> 13:20.280]  going to be blown back up that when they take Congress they can impeach Trump.
[13:20.280 --> 13:26.240]  And when that fails and when they're faced with the second harsh reality that everything
[13:26.240 --> 13:33.640]  they believed in was a lie, what are they going to do then?
[13:33.640 --> 13:37.000]  We've already seen Antifa get violent.
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.280]  We've already seen Black Lives Matter, a chance to kill police.
[13:42.280 --> 13:45.440]  What are they going to do next?
[13:45.440 --> 13:54.280]  And what is it going to take for the police, or again, I'm not kidding, maybe we need to
[13:54.280 --> 13:57.560]  reopen mental institutions.
[13:57.560 --> 14:05.080]  You see there's a weird thing you can do with an individual who thinks that they're invincible.
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.120]  For example, look at food stamps.
[14:09.120 --> 14:13.640]  We've been talking about all these people on food stamps that feel totally entitled
[14:13.640 --> 14:14.640]  to food stamps.
[14:14.640 --> 14:17.920]  They feel like their family is your responsibility.
[14:17.920 --> 14:20.560]  How dare you expect me to care for my family?
[14:20.560 --> 14:22.680]  I need my food stamps.
[14:22.680 --> 14:23.680]  Just give me my food stamps.
[14:23.680 --> 14:25.480]  We've played the clips over and over and over.
[14:25.480 --> 14:28.680]  You've seen the stories of someone's food stamps getting denied at the grocery store
[14:28.680 --> 14:32.680]  and then they tear the grocery store apart.
[14:32.680 --> 14:38.320]  There's always something you can do to stop someone that feels invincible without actually
[14:38.320 --> 14:39.320]  having to do anything.
[14:39.320 --> 14:41.600]  This is all you've got to do to stop that.
[14:41.600 --> 14:46.080]  You want to get food stamps, you're going to get drug tested.
[14:46.080 --> 14:52.040]  How much do you want to bet half of food stamp recipients would no longer receive food stamps,
[14:52.040 --> 14:58.240]  either A, because they failed a drug test, or B, because they don't want to take a drug
[14:58.240 --> 14:59.240]  test.
[14:59.240 --> 15:03.160]  It's the same type of situation.
[15:03.160 --> 15:08.520]  If you're going to go to Disneyland or Disney World and yell at a Trump robot and cause
[15:08.520 --> 15:15.000]  a scene, maybe it's time to lock you away in a rubber room for 24 hours.
[15:15.000 --> 15:22.000]  You start doing that, all of a sudden the Trump derangement syndrome will disappear.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.160]  I just don't see how it gets any better, because 2018 is going to be another year of nothing
[15:27.160 --> 15:30.280]  but defeat for these people.
[15:30.280 --> 15:34.080]  They're going to be defeated in Congress, they're going to be defeated in the culture
[15:34.080 --> 15:42.720]  war, they're going to be defeated in the information war, and we're, I mean, I guess it's bad that
[15:42.720 --> 15:47.720]  Trump cut our taxes, I guess it's bad that the stock market is reaching records.
[15:47.720 --> 15:49.560]  I guess it's all bad.
[15:49.560 --> 15:51.640]  Why would you want to get on the winning team?
[15:51.640 --> 15:54.160]  Why don't you just continue to hate America?
[15:54.160 --> 15:57.840]  Because to you, that's the winning team, even though you keep losing.
[15:57.840 --> 15:59.440]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[15:59.440 --> 16:04.240]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.

[16:27.600 --> 16:30.200]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[16:30.200 --> 16:31.200]  That's true.
[16:31.200 --> 16:34.880]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still
[16:34.880 --> 16:36.200]  alive?
[16:36.200 --> 16:39.800]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty

[20:26.080 --> 20:32.840]  No, we're not done with the liberal lunacy quite yet.
[20:32.840 --> 20:38.560]  A man yelling at a robot, that's just the beginning.
[20:38.560 --> 20:41.360]  Students support new Pocahontas policy.
[20:41.360 --> 20:47.480]  I wonder if that's named after Elizabeth Warren, allowing applicants to self-identify as people
[20:47.480 --> 20:50.600]  of color.
[20:50.600 --> 20:52.200]  Who comes up with this stuff?
[20:52.200 --> 20:59.280]  Ever wondered that whose brainchild is that?
[20:59.280 --> 21:11.040]  So I'm going to just go ahead and say today on air that I am a Zimbabwean transsexual.
[21:11.040 --> 21:13.000]  So welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.480]  My name is Owen Schreuer.
[21:14.480 --> 21:20.400]  I am a Zimbabwean transsexual hosting the show today for Alex.
[21:20.400 --> 21:25.400]  And this is just part of the new Pocahontas policy here at Infowars where you can identify
[21:25.400 --> 21:27.120]  as whatever you want.
[21:27.120 --> 21:31.600]  If you want to be a green badger, if you want to be an orange pumpkin, whatever it is, you
[21:31.600 --> 21:36.640]  just identify as that and then therefore you are because, well, you're feelings.
[21:36.640 --> 21:41.000]  But no, this is a serious thing.
[21:41.000 --> 21:47.080]  At Brown University, applicants will have the opportunity to self-identify as people
[21:47.080 --> 21:49.160]  of color during the application process.
[21:49.160 --> 21:54.960]  So again, I'm thinking that this is directly, we should call this the Elizabeth Warren policy,
[21:54.960 --> 21:57.640]  but the Pocahontas policy is just fine too.
[21:57.640 --> 22:03.120]  But here's the clip from Campus Reform talking to the students about this policy.
[22:03.120 --> 22:05.560]  I'm Cabo Phillips with Campus Reform.
[22:05.560 --> 22:09.200]  Today we're at Brown University where a new policy was enacted giving students the ability
[22:09.200 --> 22:12.960]  to self-identify as people of color on their application process.
[22:12.960 --> 22:15.320]  What do students think of this new policy?
[22:15.320 --> 22:16.320]  Let's find out.
[22:16.320 --> 22:19.960]  The rule is giving students the chance to self-identify in their words as whether they
[22:19.960 --> 22:23.600]  feel as if they're a person of color on the application process.
[22:23.600 --> 22:28.080]  Some people are calling this the Pocahontas policy because students can simply check something
[22:28.080 --> 22:29.080]  that they don't apply to.
[22:29.080 --> 22:30.080]  What do you think?
[22:30.080 --> 22:31.080]  You think it's a good thing or a bad thing?
[22:31.080 --> 22:33.280]  Overall, I think it's a good thing.
[22:33.280 --> 22:34.960]  I think this is a positive aspect.
[22:34.960 --> 22:41.120]  It's intended to create an atmosphere of inclusion and support diversity and I don't see anything
[22:41.120 --> 22:43.200]  wrong with that, including that would be a really good thing.
[22:43.200 --> 22:44.200]  Hold on.
[22:44.200 --> 22:45.200]  Pause it.
[22:45.200 --> 22:46.200]  Pause it.
[22:46.200 --> 22:49.040]  Pause it.
[22:49.040 --> 22:54.400]  Think about it like this.
[22:54.400 --> 23:00.280]  You've got all of these people at universities that will protest a Milo-Unopolis speech or
[23:00.280 --> 23:05.160]  a Ben Shapiro speech or whoever's speaking on these campuses and they get violent.
[23:05.160 --> 23:10.600]  Luchin Wintritt from the Gateway Pundit, they take his speech from him.
[23:10.600 --> 23:18.440]  So you got all of these crazy liberals out there that want to protest free speech.
[23:18.440 --> 23:24.040]  And I'm wondering if they would still agree with this policy if Milo-Unopolis showed
[23:24.040 --> 23:28.200]  up and said he was black and he self-identifies as black.
[23:28.200 --> 23:32.920]  And then when they protested him, he'd say, hey, you are all racists against black people.
[23:32.920 --> 23:35.520]  I wonder how that would go if you turned the worm on him like that.
[23:35.520 --> 23:37.360]  But see, here's their problem.
[23:37.360 --> 23:40.800]  They don't have, they don't even have two-dimensional thinking.
[23:40.800 --> 23:44.840]  They have one-dimensional thinking, fully one-dimensional thinking.
[23:44.840 --> 23:50.480]  Hey, we're going to say that you can identify as whoever you want on your application because
[23:50.480 --> 23:51.480]  of tolerance.
[23:51.480 --> 23:52.480]  Oh, yeah.
[23:52.480 --> 23:53.480]  Yeah.
[23:53.480 --> 23:54.480]  I don't see anything wrong with that.
[23:54.480 --> 23:55.480]  Yeah, it's loving.
[23:55.480 --> 23:56.480]  It's good.
[23:56.480 --> 23:57.480]  And let's go back to the video.
[23:57.480 --> 23:58.480]  Here they are.
[23:58.480 --> 23:59.480]  Here's the actual morons that believe that.
[23:59.480 --> 24:02.480]  Whether you identify as something, it should be their right to.
[24:02.480 --> 24:05.200]  I think it would generally be a positive thing.
[24:05.200 --> 24:08.480]  It should be granted all the options that they feel necessary to express themselves in that
[24:08.480 --> 24:09.480]  way.
[24:09.480 --> 24:12.560]  The goal is student comfort and attracting a more diverse student body than I don't
[24:12.560 --> 24:14.120]  see this particularly harmful.
[24:14.120 --> 24:18.120]  I feel weird talking about this as not a person of color.
[24:18.120 --> 24:21.200]  But you could do like one, though.
[24:21.200 --> 24:22.200]  Yeah.
[24:22.200 --> 24:23.200]  See, exactly.
[24:23.200 --> 24:24.200]  No, no.
[24:24.200 --> 24:25.200]  One right there.
[24:25.200 --> 24:26.560]  Oh, this is the perfect thing.
[24:26.560 --> 24:29.520]  I love it when this happens.
[24:29.520 --> 24:34.320]  I had this happen to me all the time when I'm out interviewing these brain-dead liberals
[24:34.320 --> 24:40.120]  where some of them may actually have the ability to begin the process of second-dimensional
[24:40.120 --> 24:43.960]  thinking, but they've never actually been challenged to go to that level.
[24:43.960 --> 24:48.160]  There's a specific video where I'm talking to a guy here in Austin and I forget what
[24:48.160 --> 24:52.040]  I asked him and I put the mic in front of his face and he's like, whoa, that's true.
[24:52.040 --> 24:54.600]  Like how did you, what?
[24:54.600 --> 24:55.960]  That's what happened to this guy.
[24:55.960 --> 24:56.960]  He's like, yeah.
[24:56.960 --> 25:00.080]  Yeah, you should be able to identify as whatever you want, but you know, it's kind of weird
[25:00.080 --> 25:03.200]  for me as someone that's not a person of color to be saying that.
[25:03.200 --> 25:06.520]  And so then the guy asking the question says, well, maybe you are a person of color.
[25:06.520 --> 25:07.520]  Do you feel like it?
[25:07.520 --> 25:10.920]  And then he's like, oh, so, so watch this again.
[25:10.920 --> 25:11.920]  This is the moment.
[25:11.920 --> 25:13.800]  These are, these are beautiful moments.
[25:13.800 --> 25:18.800]  For the first time at this is, I mean, this guy is at Brown University.
[25:18.800 --> 25:24.560]  Supposedly these are bastions of higher learning and this guy has never been challenged enough
[25:24.560 --> 25:28.400]  to kick in to a second-dimensional gear of thinking.
[25:28.400 --> 25:33.560]  For the first time in his life, probably this guy from campus reform kicks this guy's thought
[25:33.560 --> 25:37.040]  process into second gear and he freezes.
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.040]  Watch this.
[25:38.040 --> 25:46.160]  You're talking about this as not a person of color and what if you feel like one though?
[25:46.160 --> 25:47.160]  There it is.
[25:47.160 --> 25:48.160]  He doesn't know what to do.
[25:48.160 --> 25:49.160]  That's it.
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.200]  He's trying to go into second gear and he can't do it.
[25:53.200 --> 25:55.360]  He's never done it before.
[25:55.360 --> 25:57.080]  He's at a university.
[25:57.080 --> 26:04.480]  He's at Brown University, supposedly higher learning, higher education, and he's never
[26:04.480 --> 26:10.320]  been so challenged that he's had to go into second gear of thinking.
[26:10.320 --> 26:11.400]  This is so gold.
[26:11.400 --> 26:18.840]  I'm telling you, everything, I just want these liberals to understand, man.
[26:18.840 --> 26:20.480]  We're not your enemy.
[26:20.480 --> 26:22.120]  We're really not your enemy, man.
[26:22.120 --> 26:23.120]  Okay?
[26:23.120 --> 26:24.120]  We're not racist.
[26:24.120 --> 26:25.120]  We're not bigots.
[26:25.120 --> 26:27.200]  We don't hate people.
[26:27.200 --> 26:30.440]  We're just trying to get you to wake up.
[26:30.440 --> 26:31.440]  That's all.
[26:31.440 --> 26:35.800]  And I know it might be hard and it might be uncomfortable for you to actually have to
[26:35.800 --> 26:41.640]  think beyond your feelings and to kick into second gear and have critical thought.
[26:41.640 --> 26:45.440]  But I promise you, it is worth it in the end.
[26:45.440 --> 26:47.720]  Just play this gold for me one more time.
[26:47.720 --> 26:54.600]  I'm telling you, these students, these young liberals have never been challenged at their
[26:54.600 --> 27:00.560]  universities to actually go into critical thinking and to go into second-dimensional thinking
[27:00.560 --> 27:03.200]  because it's all about their feelings.
[27:03.200 --> 27:08.880]  It's all about liberalism and tolerance and not offending anybody and not having differing
[27:08.880 --> 27:11.360]  opinions because that might offend somebody.
[27:11.360 --> 27:17.800]  And then here this student is, a campus reform reporter who's not even a professor at the
[27:17.800 --> 27:24.000]  university for the first time ever causes his mind to go into second gear one more
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  time.
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.400]  Watch this poor brainwashed student for the first time in his life have to kick his thought
[27:30.400 --> 27:32.800]  process into second gear.
[27:32.800 --> 27:40.680]  I feel weird talking about this as not a person of color and what if you feel like one though?
[27:40.680 --> 27:42.180]  Brain freeze.
[27:42.180 --> 27:47.480]  If the school came to someone who falsely claimed to be a person of color and said you're not,
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.360]  what if the person said, I am, I identify that way?
[27:52.360 --> 27:54.360]  I mean, here it is again.
[27:54.360 --> 27:55.360]  This is incredible.
[27:55.360 --> 27:58.080]  I don't think I'm allowed to change my ethnicity.
[27:58.080 --> 28:00.080]  But why is it different than gender?
[28:00.080 --> 28:01.080]  Oh, wow.
[28:01.080 --> 28:02.880]  That's a really good question.
[28:02.880 --> 28:08.040]  I think it's intended for those people that want to identify as a person of color or whatever
[28:08.040 --> 28:09.040]  it may be.
[28:09.040 --> 28:17.640]  Here's a racial identity something that is fluid over someone's life.
[28:17.640 --> 28:18.800]  I'm losing it here.
[28:18.800 --> 28:23.640]  I feel like people tend not to try and make up their identity.
[28:23.640 --> 28:27.280]  I feel like something that people themselves know better than people who don't know them
[28:27.280 --> 28:29.760]  and something that society likes to put on them.
[28:29.760 --> 28:35.320]  I think that gender is something that is inside of you and that you feel, whereas ethnicity
[28:35.320 --> 28:38.800]  has ties to culture and heritage and tradition.
[28:38.800 --> 28:39.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:39.800 --> 28:40.800]  You know what?
[28:40.800 --> 28:41.800]  I'm not sure.
[28:41.800 --> 28:43.560]  Am I a male or a female?
[28:43.560 --> 28:45.120]  Let me check real quick.
[28:45.120 --> 28:46.120]  I think it's important.
[28:46.120 --> 28:51.960]  It looks like I'm a male, but I'm feeling like a female today, so I'm a Zimbabwean transsexual
[28:51.960 --> 28:55.040]  dog hosting the Alex Jones show today because of my feelings.
[28:55.040 --> 28:56.280]  That's how I feel.
[28:56.280 --> 28:57.280]  What?
[28:57.280 --> 28:58.640]  Hey, Daniel Brieman.

[29:27.520 --> 29:30.120]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[29:30.120 --> 29:31.120]  That's true.
[29:31.120 --> 29:34.920]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still
[29:34.920 --> 29:36.120]  alive?

[29:58.800 --> 30:05.400]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and
[30:05.400 --> 30:10.760]  water supply that are making us fat, sick and stupid.
[30:10.760 --> 30:12.080]  So what do we do about it?
[30:12.080 --> 30:15.400]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[30:15.400 --> 30:22.280]  Fight back with the all-new, supercharged Brain Force Plus and feel the rush without

[33:20.760 --> 33:40.880]  Oh and Troy you're filling in for Alex Jones today and you may or may not be able to notice
[33:40.880 --> 33:46.920]  but I'm a bit under the weather today and I'm telling you if it wasn't for infowarstore.com
[33:46.920 --> 33:51.960]  and the products there that I'm taking I would not be able to get on air today.
[33:51.960 --> 33:54.680]  Specifically what I'm taking to get on air today.
[33:54.680 --> 33:58.600]  Vitamin mineral fusion, chugging colloidal silver way more than you should.
[33:58.600 --> 34:00.920]  I'm not recommending you do that.
[34:00.920 --> 34:02.640]  Vitamin B12.
[34:02.640 --> 34:07.000]  So I mean if it wasn't for brain force, forgot that yeah brain force, if it wasn't for just
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.200]  the combination of products at infowarstore.com I don't even think I'd be able to get on air
[34:11.200 --> 34:17.960]  today just because just the allergies are just so bad down here and it's just crazy
[34:17.960 --> 34:20.600]  right now and then there's winter because global warming isn't working.
[34:20.600 --> 34:21.600]  I'm a little ticked off.
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.200]  I'm kind of a fan of global warming to be honest but if you haven't tried the products
[34:25.200 --> 34:29.040]  at infowarstore.com I'm not sure what you're waiting for.
[34:29.040 --> 34:31.040]  Just go look at all the reviews.
[34:31.040 --> 34:32.520]  Don't take my word for it.
[34:32.520 --> 34:38.960]  Go and look at all the reviews that we have at infowarstore.com and you can see for yourself
[34:38.960 --> 34:40.760]  what people are saying.
[34:40.760 --> 34:43.400]  Now right now we have some specials running.
[34:43.400 --> 34:45.000]  Silver bullet 67% off.
[34:45.000 --> 34:46.360]  I'd get a case of that.
[34:46.360 --> 34:48.400]  That's an unbeatable deal.
[34:48.400 --> 34:55.240]  Brain force is still half off, 50% off brain force plus our new product alpha power is
[34:55.240 --> 34:59.520]  50% off and I actually had a couple people tell me that they took the alpha power and
[34:59.520 --> 35:01.480]  they got nauseous.
[35:01.480 --> 35:07.000]  What I would suggest if that is happening to you is don't take it on an empty stomach
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.320]  because there's a lot of supplements out there that if you take them on an empty stomach
[35:12.320 --> 35:20.480]  they will make you feel nauseous if your body is not acclimated to certain nutrients getting
[35:20.480 --> 35:22.040]  in there, getting into your gut.
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.800]  So if you are experiencing that I would suggest not taking them on an empty stomach but just
[35:27.800 --> 35:28.960]  know this.
[35:28.960 --> 35:31.640]  That's because they work.
[35:31.640 --> 35:33.400]  These products are no joke.
[35:33.400 --> 35:39.720]  So 50% off alpha power right now and you've also got the Gut Pack, the New Year's Gut
[35:39.720 --> 35:45.680]  Pack right now that's Myco ZX plus fluorolife 50% off.
[35:45.680 --> 35:51.120]  So if you're somebody that struggles with digestive health or you have a gluten intolerance
[35:51.120 --> 35:56.640]  or something along those lines this is a great special for you.
[35:56.640 --> 36:01.720]  The Myco ZX fluorolife combo at 50% off.
[36:01.720 --> 36:06.720]  Now if you get just the Myco ZX that's 25% off if you get just the fluorolife I think
[36:06.720 --> 36:14.000]  that was 33% off but if you get both of them combined that is 50% off.
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.320]  That's the New Year's Gut Pack special Myco ZX and fluorolife 50% off but you know one
[36:20.320 --> 36:26.400]  product that I'm trying to get far and wide with my friends and family is super blue toothpaste
[36:26.400 --> 36:32.120]  because once you go super blue you're never going back.
[36:32.120 --> 36:35.380]  And this is something that is a household item.
[36:35.380 --> 36:36.720]  Everybody needs toothpaste.
[36:36.720 --> 36:38.720]  Everybody uses toothpaste.
[36:38.720 --> 36:41.120]  Why not shop at InfowarsStore.com.
[36:41.120 --> 36:45.080]  It's just like the other day I ran out of hand soap and I'm thinking oh I need to go
[36:45.080 --> 36:49.200]  get some hand soap from the store and then I remember wait a second we've got EmRick's
[36:49.200 --> 36:50.200]  Essentials.

[37:26.880 --> 37:28.600]  more live broadcasts.
[37:28.600 --> 37:32.560]  So that's what happens when you support us at InfowarsStore.com they're going through
[37:32.560 --> 37:34.200]  EmRick's Essentials.
[37:34.200 --> 37:36.320]  Look at all these essential oils they have.
[37:36.320 --> 37:42.120]  I know people that are really into essential oils so why not go to InfowarsStore.com and
[37:42.120 --> 37:49.240]  check out some of our essential oils and again don't take my word for it go to the InfowarsStore.com
[37:49.240 --> 37:52.080]  and look at the reviews for Brainforce Plus.
[37:52.080 --> 37:54.640]  Look at the reviews for SuperMail Vitality.
[37:54.640 --> 37:59.520]  Look at the reviews for Silver Bullet and you will see that these products are no joke
[37:59.520 --> 38:01.640]  and they truly do work.
[38:01.640 --> 38:09.160]  Okay, in the last segment we played the campus reform video where students at Brown University
[38:09.160 --> 38:12.480]  are looking at a new policy where they're calling it the Pocahontas policy.
[38:12.480 --> 38:16.800]  I think they're naming it after Elizabeth Warren where you can just identify as whatever
[38:16.800 --> 38:17.800]  you want.
[38:17.800 --> 38:22.160]  You know identify on your application as a Native American like Elizabeth Warren did
[38:22.160 --> 38:25.280]  when she lied about it then that's okay now.
[38:25.280 --> 38:29.920]  Which again this shows you how they don't have a second dimension of thinking.
[38:29.920 --> 38:35.360]  How they can't kick their thinking in second gear because these are the same people that
[38:35.360 --> 38:40.740]  would have virtue signal all day long for minorities, virtue signal all day long to try
[38:40.740 --> 38:46.600]  to give them more benefits and if you're white you know take a back seat but they don't
[38:46.600 --> 38:47.600]  even understand.
[38:47.600 --> 38:48.600]  It's sad.
[38:48.600 --> 38:54.240]  They don't even have the second level of critical thinking to realize that this policy completely
[38:54.240 --> 39:01.840]  destroys their liberal policies catered to minorities where they get all the advantages.
[39:01.840 --> 39:06.880]  Because now if anyone can claim to be a minority then nobody's a minority.
[39:06.880 --> 39:08.520]  But they don't get that.
[39:08.520 --> 39:11.920]  And what I was breaking down that I thought was so powerful and then it actually happened
[39:11.920 --> 39:15.240]  again and again and again and I was focusing on the first guy.
[39:15.240 --> 39:19.320]  But this is so illustrative.
[39:19.320 --> 39:26.560]  And I really want people that disagree with infowars, that think we're nuts, that hate
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.520]  Trump, that are these indoctrinated liberals you really believe in in utopia.
[39:31.520 --> 39:34.160]  Again, we're not your enemy.
[39:34.160 --> 39:35.320]  I'm not attacking you.
[39:35.320 --> 39:37.160]  I'm just calling it as I see it.
[39:37.160 --> 39:42.000]  And I want to go back to this video that I shot in Austin, Texas.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.720]  The Harrison was my cameraman that day, Trump came to town to address Hurricane Harvey here.
[39:47.720 --> 39:52.760]  And I ran into an individual who was protesting Trump and I asked him a couple questions and
[39:52.760 --> 39:54.480]  you saw the exact same thing.
[39:54.480 --> 40:00.840]  So what I want liberals out there that see this, I just want you to recognize something
[40:00.840 --> 40:02.360]  here.
[40:02.360 --> 40:03.880]  I'm not your enemy.
[40:03.880 --> 40:05.160]  We're not your enemy.
[40:05.160 --> 40:07.380]  We want to help you.
[40:07.380 --> 40:10.520]  You have a serious brainwashing problem.
[40:10.520 --> 40:13.140]  You have a serious issue of Stockholm syndrome.
[40:13.140 --> 40:14.640]  You really have mental issues.
[40:14.640 --> 40:15.640]  We really care about you.
[40:15.640 --> 40:17.240]  I'm not trying to insult you.
[40:17.240 --> 40:19.800]  This is not me being mean.
[40:19.800 --> 40:25.800]  And just to prove what I'm talking about, let's roll this clip of the man protesting
[40:25.800 --> 40:29.640]  Trump that I forced to think critically who had a total brain freeze.
[40:29.640 --> 40:31.360]  All right, come on.
[40:31.360 --> 40:33.600]  Hey, we found this man will talk to us.
[40:33.600 --> 40:34.600]  So why should Trump be impeached?
[40:34.600 --> 40:37.280]  Because he's lied a thousand times on record.
[40:37.280 --> 40:39.280]  What does he lie about?
[40:39.280 --> 40:40.880]  Can we look it up on his phone?
[40:40.880 --> 40:42.360]  No, he's recording right now.
[40:42.360 --> 40:44.840]  But you're the one saying impeach the president.
[40:44.840 --> 40:47.960]  Yeah, yeah, because you're the one who wants to impeach him.
[40:47.960 --> 40:50.480]  I mean, I can impeach him myself.
[40:50.480 --> 40:52.600]  But you're out here with the impeach Trump crowd.
[40:52.600 --> 40:55.760]  Yeah, I would love to advance.
[40:55.760 --> 40:57.760]  You see this?
[40:57.760 --> 40:58.760]  You see this?
[40:58.760 --> 40:59.760]  Pause right here.
[40:59.760 --> 41:00.760]  You see this?
[41:00.760 --> 41:06.440]  This is, this is, this is the individual who's never been challenged to go to the second
[41:06.440 --> 41:08.560]  degree of thinking here.
[41:08.560 --> 41:11.480]  There's time being challenged and, and starting to go there.
[41:11.480 --> 41:13.240]  Let's watch the rest.
[41:13.240 --> 41:14.740]  Why?
[41:14.740 --> 41:15.740]  Because we've got a liar.
[41:15.740 --> 41:16.740]  I know.
[41:16.740 --> 41:17.740]  So it keeps coming back.
[41:17.740 --> 41:19.740]  So what did he lie about?
[41:19.740 --> 41:20.740]  Let's look this up.
[41:20.740 --> 41:21.740]  Okay.
[41:21.740 --> 41:22.740]  Now he goes to his phone.
[41:22.740 --> 41:23.740]  You're out here protesting.
[41:23.740 --> 41:24.740]  You shouldn't have to look it up.
[41:24.740 --> 41:26.360]  You know, you should already know your cause, don't you think?
[41:26.360 --> 41:28.560]  You're probably, you know, right in some way.
[41:28.560 --> 41:34.400]  I mean, if you have to look it up, it must not be that important to you, you know?
[41:34.400 --> 41:35.400]  This sounds like a leading question.
[41:35.400 --> 41:37.920]  I'll tell you what, I'll let you do some research and we'll come back.
[41:37.920 --> 41:38.920]  How about that?
[41:38.920 --> 41:39.920]  There he goes.
[41:39.920 --> 41:40.920]  No problem.
[41:40.920 --> 41:41.920]  Hey, thank you for talking.
[41:41.920 --> 41:42.920]  So, so look.
[41:42.920 --> 41:43.920]  I already tried to talk to you.
[41:43.920 --> 41:44.920]  So that's enough guys.
[41:44.920 --> 41:52.740]  So, but there's this, and I understand why, because we come on here, we call them libtards.
[41:52.740 --> 42:02.080]  You know, but folks, what is the future of an individual like that individual or an individual
[42:02.080 --> 42:06.760]  like we saw in the campus reform video that can't even critically think?
[42:06.760 --> 42:08.920]  Yeah, look at his face.
[42:08.920 --> 42:11.920]  I'm not insulting this individual, but look at that face.
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.760]  He's, he's, that is the face of a man who for the first time ever has been challenged
[42:16.760 --> 42:20.040]  to think beyond his own feelings.
[42:20.040 --> 42:24.480]  And he realizes it and he goes, wow, yeah, you're probably right.
[42:24.480 --> 42:25.480]  But think about it.
[42:25.480 --> 42:31.720]  What is, what is the future of an individual who cannot think past one degree of thought
[42:31.720 --> 42:32.720]  process?
[42:32.720 --> 42:36.000]  What is the future of an individual who cannot think past their feelings?
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.480]  And beyond that, what is the future of a country?
[42:39.480 --> 42:40.980]  What is the future of a school?
[42:40.980 --> 42:45.720]  What is the future of a group of people that cannot think past first dimensional thinking?
[42:45.720 --> 42:48.760]  What is the future for them?
[42:48.760 --> 42:50.680]  Not good slavery.
[42:50.680 --> 42:57.600]  That's how you get tricked into slavery right there.
[42:57.600 --> 42:59.520]  Mike in Arizona here on the air worldwide.
[42:59.520 --> 43:00.520]  Go ahead.
[43:00.520 --> 43:02.840]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[43:02.840 --> 43:06.480]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[43:06.480 --> 43:13.280]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[43:13.280 --> 43:18.600]  And as a long time infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force
[43:18.600 --> 43:19.600]  anthroplex.
[43:19.600 --> 43:22.000]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the anthroplex.
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.000]  Thank you.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.600]  I use the bio true selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks for big, normal toothpaste
[43:27.600 --> 43:28.600]  fans.
[43:28.600 --> 43:29.880]  The super blue is awesome.
[43:29.880 --> 43:32.800]  Thank you so much, Alex, for the infowars life products.
[43:32.800 --> 43:33.800]  They are quality.
[43:33.800 --> 43:35.960]  I can't wait to get some more.
[43:35.960 --> 43:38.880]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[43:38.880 --> 43:39.880]  Absolutely.
[43:39.880 --> 43:45.720]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand
[43:45.720 --> 43:47.680]  that there's a bigger problems going on.
[43:47.680 --> 43:51.840]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can
[43:51.840 --> 43:57.480]  take our country back.
[43:57.480 --> 44:02.880]  2017 has been a earth shaking year.
[44:02.880 --> 44:06.040]  And 2018 guaranteed is even going to be wilder.
[44:06.040 --> 44:09.520]  In fact, my good friend, Steph, I'm Malinou said it's going to be like the battle of
[44:09.520 --> 44:10.520]  the gods.
[44:10.520 --> 44:11.520]  Ragnarok.

[45:02.080 --> 45:09.200]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[45:09.200 --> 45:13.160]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need
[45:13.160 --> 45:14.160]  every day.
[45:14.160 --> 45:17.840]  B vitamins we need every day.
[45:17.840 --> 45:25.640]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[45:25.640 --> 45:31.400]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory and lethargy.
[45:31.400 --> 45:34.120]  Secret 12, optimal absorption.
[45:34.120 --> 45:39.240]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[45:39.240 --> 45:44.600]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[45:44.600 --> 45:50.800]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[46:00.000 --> 46:01.360]  It took you over a year to do it.
[46:01.360 --> 46:03.080]  Why is this so good?
[46:03.080 --> 46:07.760]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[46:07.760 --> 46:12.400]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[46:12.400 --> 46:13.400]  my system.
[46:13.400 --> 46:19.440]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[46:19.440 --> 46:21.480]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[46:21.480 --> 46:26.560]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[46:26.560 --> 46:27.840]  going on everywhere.
[46:27.840 --> 46:28.840]  These are all parasites.
[46:28.840 --> 46:31.560]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[46:31.560 --> 46:32.800]  You have the neem in there.
[46:32.800 --> 46:35.880]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[46:35.880 --> 46:39.200]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[46:39.200 --> 46:40.200]  All right.
[46:40.200 --> 46:42.360]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[46:42.360 --> 46:46.240]  We just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose.
[46:46.240 --> 46:52.440]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[46:52.440 --> 46:54.680]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[46:54.680 --> 47:01.320]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[47:01.320 --> 47:14.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:14.440 --> 47:21.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:21.040 --> 47:23.040]  All right.
[47:23.040 --> 47:27.160]  Let's look at some of this news that we have here today.
[47:27.160 --> 47:32.560]  You've got a rare intersex shark, the first of its kind.
[47:32.560 --> 47:39.560]  So yeah, I mean, I guess that's kind of rare, the only one, pretty rare.
[47:39.560 --> 47:46.520]  You know, but this is probably a conspiracy theory like the gay frogs, and the atrazine
[47:46.520 --> 47:49.360]  probably doesn't exist.
[47:49.360 --> 47:57.920]  But now, for the first time ever, a intersex shark has been found with male and female
[47:57.920 --> 48:00.440]  reproductive systems.
[48:00.440 --> 48:05.640]  I'm sure that has nothing to do with the chemicals that we've intoxicated our planet with.
[48:05.640 --> 48:09.440]  I'm sure it has nothing to do with that at all.
[48:09.440 --> 48:15.920]  Nothing to see here, nothing to see with the gay frogs either.
[48:15.920 --> 48:23.000]  Here's a story in the New York Times today, the year the news accelerated to Trump speed.
[48:23.000 --> 48:31.840]  It really is mind boggling everything that got exposed in Trump's first year in office.
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.640]  It's almost impossible to sit here and try to name it all, and that's because it was
[48:36.640 --> 48:39.360]  breaking all the time.
[48:39.360 --> 48:45.680]  I mean, just look at everything that was exposed with Barack Obama.
[48:45.680 --> 48:47.600]  Look at everything that was exposed with Hillary Clinton.
[48:47.600 --> 48:49.600]  Look at everything that was exposed with the FBI.
[48:49.600 --> 48:56.120]  Look at everything that was exposed with the Me Too movement.
[48:56.120 --> 48:58.360]  It's really quite incredible.
[48:58.360 --> 49:07.600]  Meanwhile, half of abducted Iraqi Yazidi girls remain in ISIS captivity and sex slavery.
[49:07.600 --> 49:13.480]  Thousands of kidnapped girls forgotten in hell.
[49:13.480 --> 49:18.200]  And this was also a result of what Hillary Clinton's policy in Libya did where they have
[49:18.200 --> 49:20.120]  slaves now.
[49:20.120 --> 49:23.360]  But we're the racists because we call it out.
[49:23.360 --> 49:24.360]  And that's a great point.
[49:24.360 --> 49:28.000]  In fact, I was going to probably pop it on the show today about that that's why I came
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  in here when I saw you recovering.
[49:29.000 --> 49:34.360]  And just the whole fact that you like the New York Times admits, news at Trump's speed.
[49:34.360 --> 49:39.000]  We are taking control of the narrative, not just Trump, all of us by what we want to break,
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.040]  what we want to focus on, not letting the globalists set the subjects anymore.
[49:43.040 --> 49:45.400]  Their back is broken in 2017.
[49:45.400 --> 49:51.960]  Now the big war is in 2018 with the floundering remnants of the globalist.
[49:51.960 --> 49:53.320]  I completely agree.
[49:53.320 --> 49:54.320]  And they can't keep up.
[49:54.320 --> 49:56.960]  And that's why they're failing.
[49:56.960 --> 50:05.320]  See, there is no one at the New York Times that could actually write a story where they
[50:05.320 --> 50:11.840]  have to do some serious soul searching and say, wow, maybe all those negative stories
[50:11.840 --> 50:17.320]  we wrote about Trump were inaccurate, considering none of them really caught any headwinds.
[50:17.320 --> 50:22.600]  Meanwhile, look at all the momentum going against Robert Mueller right now, how it's
[50:22.600 --> 50:26.160]  been discovered that that whole thing was a witch hunt beyond a witch hunt.
[50:26.160 --> 50:31.600]  And that the same FBI agents that were trying to rig the election for Hillary Clinton, look
[50:31.600 --> 50:37.440]  at James Comey, look at Peter Stroke, are the same people that are now behind the Trump
[50:37.440 --> 50:38.440]  Russia probe.
[50:38.440 --> 50:43.480]  Oh, but I'm sure that there is no bias there.
[50:43.480 --> 50:49.280]  But look at this victory for Trump, China offers tax incentives to persuade U.S. companies
[50:49.280 --> 50:51.760]  to stay.
[50:51.760 --> 50:59.840]  Folks, there is a geopolitical climate change happening right now.
[50:59.840 --> 51:06.000]  And you have to understand that what Trump did when he cut the corporate tax rate to
[51:06.000 --> 51:12.120]  20% is he basically just kicked China in the groin.
[51:12.120 --> 51:20.080]  Because now China does not have a stranglehold on manufacturing companies coming in.
[51:20.080 --> 51:25.320]  So now all of a sudden, America gets this new boost to their economy, America gets this
[51:25.320 --> 51:31.200]  new boost of manufacturing companies wanting to come and do business in America.
[51:31.200 --> 51:37.080]  And that breaks China's will to dominate that sector, which is what they wanted.
[51:37.080 --> 51:42.880]  And so now all of a sudden, with this whole North Korea thing, China doesn't have as much
[51:42.880 --> 51:48.480]  power to wield as they had before when they could just dominate that and take all the
[51:48.480 --> 51:51.840]  manufacturing.
[51:51.840 --> 51:56.280]  But see, this is what the Democrats don't understand, but maybe they do understand and
[51:56.280 --> 52:00.640]  perhaps they just want China to have the booming economy.
[52:00.640 --> 52:05.760]  They don't want the United States to have a 3% GDP growth every year.
[52:05.760 --> 52:14.320]  And in fact, I truly believe we will see, I mean, barring something catastrophic, we
[52:14.320 --> 52:24.240]  will see probably a four, if not a 5% GDP growth within one quarter of Donald Trump's
[52:24.240 --> 52:27.680]  first four years in office.
[52:27.680 --> 52:31.000]  And I really believe that.
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.360]  And that's what you do to build your country back up.
[52:34.360 --> 52:37.280]  If you're an enemy of a country, what do you do?
[52:37.280 --> 52:41.480]  You attack their energy sector, you try to destroy their energy supply, look at what
[52:41.480 --> 52:43.400]  Obama did to coal.
[52:43.400 --> 52:48.920]  Trump reverses that, brings coal back, GDP shoots back up, China's back's against the
[52:48.920 --> 52:50.960]  wall now.
[52:50.960 --> 52:58.040]  So I know that this is too complicated for the average, honestly, probably just the average
[52:58.040 --> 53:00.160]  person, but the average liberal has no idea.
[53:00.160 --> 53:05.240]  They couldn't even probably find China on a map, if you want to be perfectly honest.
[53:05.240 --> 53:10.960]  But then you have this story, could the Dow hit 25,000 before 2018?
[53:10.960 --> 53:11.960]  It's flirting with it.
[53:11.960 --> 53:14.600]  I think right now it's at like 24,7 maybe.
[53:14.600 --> 53:18.360]  I'm not sure what it currently stands at.
[53:18.360 --> 53:31.240]  According to this story published this morning, it was at 24,8, well, wow, wow.
[53:31.240 --> 53:34.160]  I just, President Trump man, you know, he's not perfect.
[53:34.160 --> 53:38.760]  I'm not going to sit here and fanboy over Trump, but I mean, my goodness, can you imagine
[53:38.760 --> 53:44.400]  if Hillary Clinton would have been president?
[53:44.400 --> 53:45.400]  I can't even imagine.
[53:45.400 --> 53:48.200]  Honestly, I cannot even imagine.
[53:48.200 --> 53:52.560]  And you know, if Hillary Clinton would have won, none of this Weinstein Gate would have
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.920]  happened at all, none of it, zero, Weinstein Gate would have never happened, Hollywood
[53:57.920 --> 54:00.200]  would have never been exposed.
[54:00.200 --> 54:05.760]  Because every time, every tactic that they use to try to take down Trump, whether it
[54:05.760 --> 54:11.080]  be this Russian probe that's now been exposed as totally biased and now even beyond bias
[54:11.080 --> 54:17.200]  with what appears to be traitors inside the government, you've got this Weinstein Gate
[54:17.200 --> 54:25.280]  where Hollywood gets exposed as a bastion of sexual deviancy and sexual assault.
[54:25.280 --> 54:28.520]  And you know, you've got some people calling it both ways, like, yeah, okay, these powerful
[54:28.520 --> 54:32.560]  men in Hollywood were probably inappropriately abusing women, but at the same time there
[54:32.560 --> 54:38.680]  were women in Hollywood that were glad to put themselves out there for a role or for
[54:38.680 --> 54:39.760]  career advancement.
[54:39.760 --> 54:44.160]  So it goes a little both ways, but this was the battle they chose because they thought
[54:44.160 --> 54:48.520]  it would come back and land on Trump, which it's not.
[54:48.520 --> 54:49.520]  It's not sticking.
[54:49.520 --> 54:53.120]  So again, they're just exposing themselves.
[54:53.120 --> 54:59.120]  A powerful person has been accused of misconduct at a rate of once every 20 hours since Weinstein
[54:59.120 --> 55:07.200]  and not to politicize this, but just to call it as it is, 90% of these people are good liberals.
[55:07.200 --> 55:13.160]  90% of these people hang out in the same circle of friends as Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[55:13.160 --> 55:19.400]  A lot of these people are even donating to Bill and Hillary Clinton's campaigns, Obama's
[55:19.400 --> 55:23.240]  campaigns, getting praised by the Obamas for how good they are, getting praised by
[55:23.240 --> 55:25.200]  the Michael Morris for how good they are.
[55:25.200 --> 55:32.200]  Oh, then they get exposed as sexual assaulters.
[55:32.200 --> 55:36.520]  Never would have happened if it wasn't for President Trump.
[55:36.520 --> 55:43.760]  So just remember, before you want to blame Trump of whatever it is you're going to try
[55:43.760 --> 55:48.560]  to blame him of, you're probably the guilty party and it's going to come back on you,
[55:48.560 --> 55:49.560]  Sheila Jackson Lee.
[55:49.560 --> 55:52.960]  You might want to get out of office before you have a hard fall.
[55:52.960 --> 55:55.760]  Now this story actually broke yesterday.
[55:55.760 --> 55:59.880]  Date set for Trump's first physical exam is present.
[55:59.880 --> 56:05.120]  I have a feeling that when we get these results, the physical exam is on January 12th.
[56:05.120 --> 56:07.320]  I don't know when they'll make it public.
[56:07.320 --> 56:13.240]  I have a feeling that these results are going to trigger the liberals so hard.
[56:13.240 --> 56:20.720]  Now this is actually going to be interesting because you know that they're going to try
[56:20.720 --> 56:26.880]  to spin this and say he's unfit, try to invoke the 25th Amendment, say he's unhealthy, he
[56:26.880 --> 56:29.360]  can't handle it.
[56:29.360 --> 56:31.200]  That's going to be the spin.
[56:31.200 --> 56:35.800]  And then if they release the reports and he's fully healthy, healthiest president ever, what
[56:35.800 --> 56:38.800]  are they going to do then?
[56:38.800 --> 56:44.320]  So this is just another liberal breakdown waiting to happen here when Trump's health
[56:44.320 --> 56:48.000]  is announced because honestly, I don't know how Trump does it.
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.400]  I don't know how Trump works so hard.
[56:49.400 --> 56:53.080]  I don't know how he sleeps four hours a day and is still able to do everything he does.
[56:53.080 --> 56:54.800]  It's really quite shocking to me.
[56:54.800 --> 56:56.320]  I could never do it.
[56:56.320 --> 56:57.320]  And I'm 28 years old.
[56:57.320 --> 57:03.000]  I couldn't imagine a 71-year-old man sleeping four hours a day and working his ass off.
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.360]  But then again, as far as I know, this is the only president of the United States that's
[57:07.360 --> 57:08.360]  sober.
[57:08.360 --> 57:13.200]  I've never heard of a president that never drank alcohol or never touched any drugs.
[57:13.200 --> 57:14.920]  Obama used to brag about that stuff.
[57:14.920 --> 57:20.000]  So maybe that has something to do with it.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.920]  He's never intoxicated himself with drugs or alcohol.
[57:23.920 --> 57:29.600]  But that's just incredible, and I'm expecting that physical to be sterling and for the liberals
[57:29.600 --> 57:35.680]  to actually freak out as the mainstream fake news spin is, he's unfit.
[57:35.680 --> 57:36.680]  He's unhealthy.
[57:36.680 --> 57:37.680]  He can't make it.
[57:37.680 --> 57:39.200]  We need to invoke the 25th.
[57:39.200 --> 57:43.000]  Then the health report comes out, oh, President Trump is one of the most healthy 71-year-olds
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.720]  probably walking planet Earth.
[57:44.720 --> 57:46.520]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over on the other side.
[57:46.520 --> 57:47.520]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.440]  Climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by InfoWarsLife.
[57:52.440 --> 57:59.400]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[57:59.400 --> 58:05.840]  levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[58:05.840 --> 58:13.040]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[58:13.040 --> 58:17.560]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[58:17.560 --> 58:18.560]  the market.
[58:18.560 --> 58:25.040]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[58:25.040 --> 58:32.000]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo

[59:52.280 --> 01:00:08.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:15.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic is Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:23.640]  Alex Jones sitting to my right and we are about to throw things over to Paul Joseph
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640]  Watson.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:28.880]  We wanted to get a little round table going here and I'll just start it with this, Alex.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:36.200]  I have never been more patient in my life because it's like they've fallen apart at
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.200]  every angle.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.320]  They've fallen apart at Trump Russia.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.680]  They've fallen apart on global warming.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.040]  They've fallen apart on open borders.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.520]  They haven't succeeded anywhere, Alex.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.520]  We keep winning.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:50.200]  And that's because no one ever really challenged them and they had this con game going, this
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:55.920]  illusion and the globalists had hijacked America and hijacked Europe and used those engines
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.200]  in our good name to take over the world.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:05.480]  But ragtag groups for decades, going back to very gold water right through Ron Paul,
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.480]  you name it.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.200]  Ronald Reagan when he was running for office talked about the globalists because of that
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.000]  and then the new media like dredge report and info wars and then Breitbart and others
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  that came along later.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.080]  We normalized covering globalism and the new world order and what was really going on.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.640]  They thought they would just use the power of the appeal to authority of MSM to just
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.040]  call us cooks, call us conspiracy theorists, but it doesn't work anymore, but they are
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.040]  going to counter strike.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.520]  I mean, 2017 has been an amazing year for awakening, but I agree with Paul.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:40.680]  I think 2018 is going to be even more important than 2016 and 2017.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.920]  And so everybody better be watching their six.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.040]  And I think out on the offensive, Paul Watson, tell us what you got coming up today.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:54.200]  Alex, we've got the news out of Germany where Berlin is setting up a safe zone, a cultural
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.720]  enrichment free zone to protect women from migrant sex attacks.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.120]  They don't say that directly, but obviously that's what it's for.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:06.600]  And what happened two years ago in Cologne, when up to 2000 women were sexually assaulted
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600]  by migrant men?
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.400]  Of course, the same thing happened the next year that they had police out in force to
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.400]  prevent it.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.200]  And the left said that that was xenophobic.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.800]  So we'll see if it's xenophobic, if these women run to the safety of these red cross
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.720]  stations where they can seek refuge from migrant sex attacks.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:30.080]  We've also got the left being completely triggered by Trump tweeting about global warming.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.640]  This continues to rumble on.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:37.320]  They're claiming that he's saying you can't disprove global warming by citing the weather,
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:43.800]  despite the fact that that's what they do every single day, even say volcanoes or manmade.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:50.720]  Yeah, any extreme weather event, even if it's in a, you know, an isolated example, they
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.840]  say it's proof of global warming.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.480]  If you try to do that against global warming, no, no, no, you're insane.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.480]  You're anti science.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.640]  The insanity doesn't stop there, they blame, they blame migration on global warming.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.760]  They even say that migration is a result of global warming.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.280]  They open the borders up, they say come in, they drive down the wages, they exploit the
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.880]  third world, implode them, write white papers, admitting they're doing a design, but they're
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:20.120]  for public consumption, a dust storm, a volcano going off, an electromagnetic storm.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.160]  It's all us, the humans, it's all our fault.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.920]  What else is coming up, Paul?
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.400]  Well, we've got a new prediction of terror attacks that they're saying that the ISIS
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.400]  terror attacks are likely to increase in 2018 because they're being driven out of Syria
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.400]  and Iraq.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.760]  Of course, the UK, along with a lot of other European countries are deliberately allowing
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.480]  ISIS jihadists to return to the country, not just return, rolling out the red carpet in
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.840]  some cases, giving them welfare, giving them housing.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:52.080]  So yeah, of course, the likelihood of terror attacks is going to increase if you import
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.080]  terrorists.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.720]  It's a pretty simple equation there, isn't it?
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:02.680]  We've got MSNBC saying that Democrats need to run on an impeachment platform in 2018.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.840]  That's all they're going to talk about.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.160]  So again, they've got no actual policy platform.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160]  Absolutely.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.680]  All they've got is we hate Donald Trump.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.600]  It failed in 2016, it's going to fail again, but they've got nothing else to go with.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.400]  So that's all they're going to go with in 2018.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400]  Absolutely.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400]  All right.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400]  Well, Owen, great job co-hosting throughout the week.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.400]  Kind of have this mixed deal.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.760]  Most talk radio doesn't do that different host over the show, but it's the Alex Jones
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:23.760]  show.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.760]  It's Tim Fowler's live.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.760]  The listeners all know who it is.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.120]  The host, you know, they love the whole crew.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.280]  And so Paul Watson for the next two hours, then Rob Do's coming in in the fourth hour.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.960]  He's got the folks that on eight-channon, the rest of it, moderate the QAnon boards.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:44.240]  We'll talk about all that to take your phone calls on that subject and so much more.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.760]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.760]  Paul Watson is taking over.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.440]  And of course, Owen Schroyer has done a great job here in the first hour.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.680]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.800]  Stay with us.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.040]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:06.520]  you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.480]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.080]  at InfoWareShore.com.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.920]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.000]  AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.240]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.320]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.080]  the products that you need each month.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.560]  Just go to InfoWareShore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.840]  and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:45.120]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWareShore.com,
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.560]  this is a sure win.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.120]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.480]  And win, win, win at InfoWareShore.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:58.080]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:04.640]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:08.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWare is gaining more momentum.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.240]  Our movement is gaining more momentum.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:14.040]  And now, thanks to you, we are setting new milestones.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:18.320]  You have made Paul Joseph Watson set a new milestone over the last week.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.080]  So we thank you for everything you do for us.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.600]  Without further ado, I pitch it to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.600]  Take over, Paul.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.600]  Thanks, Owen.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:31.880]  Yeah, top story up on InfoWare.com this Friday, December 29th is this headline, Berlin sets
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:37.120]  up New Year's Eve party safe zone to protect women from migrant sex attacks.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.840]  Of course, that's our headline.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.120]  They don't directly admit that that's the reason for this program in the actual press
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.560]  release in the article put out by the BBC.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:50.320]  But the article reads, Berlin's New Year's Eve party at the Brandenburg Gate, obviously
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.800]  an iconic location for freedom, not so much anymore, will feature a safe zone for women
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.000]  to protect them from rape and sexual assaults by gangs of migrant men.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.200]  Women who feel harassed will be able to seek help from a special safety zone located on
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.760]  Albert Strasser, which will be staffed by the German Red Cross.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:13.080]  Now, remember, last year, the one year anniversary of the clone sex attacks, they had police
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:19.560]  out in force, and this is the footage you can see from the 2016 January mass molestation
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.080]  of women outside the Cologne Cathedral.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.640]  Again, police stood down, they lied about it, they put out an NPR-style taxpayer-funded
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.560]  documentary that said it was white German men responsible for the sex attacks.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.880]  Of course, that was complete nonsense.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.840]  The government itself admitted that the vast majority, almost all of the attackers were
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:45.280]  North African migrants or asylum seekers, were talking women being grabbed, sexually
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.080]  assaulted, in some cases, raped.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.080]  There was a woman who became pregnant after being pinned down and raped.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.320]  She had to have an abortion because of this.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:08:00.120]  Again, this is December 31st, 2015, clone sex attacks.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.680]  They tried to cover it up.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.880]  The year after they had police out in force and the left said, oh, this is so xenophobic.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:11.760]  How dare you profile the precious Muslim migrants, and yet they turned up again.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:18.320]  The next year they turned up in huge numbers, even after all the negative publicity as a
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.120]  result of these mass sexual assaults the year before, so that you can't even have police
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.760]  protecting women from being raped anymore without being called xenophobic in certain
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.760]  European cities.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.200]  So now they've got the Red Cross staffing a safe zone.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.800]  Again, this is about segregation.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:43.240]  Segregation of women in major European cities during major events.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.800]  This is the Islamization of Western society.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.960]  Women who feel harassed will be able to seek help from a special safety zone, which will
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.320]  be staffed by the German Red Cross.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:58.240]  While organizers will obviously never acknowledge it, the safe zone is blatantly designed to
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.120]  protect women from sexual assaults by predominantly Muslim migrant men.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:07.320]  Now, if you go to the BBC article, which is linked from my article from Infowars, they
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.400]  admit that this is a response to events two years ago in Cologne, which have since been
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.880]  repeated in other cities.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:18.520]  Every time there's a music festival in Sweden, there's a new a number of sexual assaults
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520]  of women.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.520]  They call for banning old men because again, you can't say exactly what type of men are
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.280]  doing this because that's xenophobic.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.640]  We can't actually crack down on the perpetrators now.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.840]  Just blame all men.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.840]  Just blame all men.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:35.800]  But even in the BBC article, they admit this is a response to Cologne when, quote, hundreds
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:40.400]  of women reported being attacked by gangs of men with migrant backgrounds.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400]  That's not Infowars.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.640]  That's the BBC acknowledging that.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:49.680]  Again, despite the fact that they had a documentary, a lefty taxpayer funded documentary in Germany
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:54.080]  come out later and say that it was German white men that were responsible and it was
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.040]  unfair to blame the precious migrants.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.480]  So they got the BBC being honest for a change, shocking footage and we were rolling it early.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.160]  We can roll that again that later emerged from the night of December 31st, 2015 in Cologne
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:11.360]  shows women screaming as they're assaulted with police totally overwhelmed and unable
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.360]  to properly respond.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.480]  One eyewitness, and we did an article about this at the time with the video, it was a
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.160]  hotel security guard who fought off some of the attackers.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:27.160]  Now, remember, probably some of you will remember this article, they had a hotel security guard,
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.160]  a big guy.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.160]  I don't think he was German.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.760]  I think he was an Eastern European who was actually in fist fights with some of these
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:39.480]  migrants as the women ran behind him for protection because the police didn't show up for an hour.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:45.480]  So women had to literally run into the doorways of hotels and try to seek refuge there.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.640]  He said at the time that police told him the scene resembled a civil war, the few police
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.080]  that were there at the time when it began.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.520]  Some women were pinned down and raped by the migrants with one victim even being impregnated
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.320]  and later forced to have an abortion.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.120]  You can link through to that story in the article.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:10.200]  Despite the unprecedented chaos, the German media failed to report any attacks for days.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.240]  There was a huge cover up in mainstream media.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.760]  This came out instantly as it was happening on social media, but there was a lockdown
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.840]  in the German media for days with them denying that this had even happened.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.840]  This is the same German media that works directly with the German government to cover up the
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:34.400]  identity of migrants when they rape women in both mass mobilization cases and individual
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.360]  cases across the country.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.920]  That was official government policy, remember, to cover up the identity of these rapists
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:47.480]  for at least a year in Germany, and they did that for days on end after this mass mobilization,
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:52.240]  which was one of the biggest stories of 2015 easily.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.160]  And yet they covered it up for days afterwards.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:00.880]  Nobody even knew about it until this deluge of social media reports just became impossible
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.880]  to ignore.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:08.600]  Police, German police were ordered to subsequently remove the word rape from their initial report.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:14.160]  Again, part of the cover up because at the time Germany was being subjected to this great
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:19.800]  cultural enrichment experiment overseen by Angela Merkel, who now herself has basically
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:24.920]  admitted that it was a total failure, as have most of her government, her approval rating
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:25.920]  is collapsing.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.040]  The AFD, the anti-immigration party, swept into third place in the German election because
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.560]  of this completely failed policy that has seen German violent crime rates surge across
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.640]  the country.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.640]  So they covered it up.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.640]  They covered up Cologne.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:46.600]  Cologne's pro-refugee mayor, you'll remember this one, Mayor Henrietta Recker, responded
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:51.600]  to the incident by trying to absolve Muslim migrants of blame and was derided for suggesting
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:58.920]  that women prevent further attacks by keeping them at arm's length, mob of 20 men surrounding
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.800]  you as a woman, just keep them at arm's length.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.960]  That's the solution, isn't it?
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.960]  Unbelievable.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:11.200]  German interior minister, Ralph Jager, also asserted that conservatives who criticized
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.440]  the wave of migrants flooding into the country on internet chat rooms were, quote, just as
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:24.240]  awful, as are his words, just as awful as the migrants who sexually molested women.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.080]  Absolutely incredible reaction from the German government.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:31.600]  Deny, deny, deny, cover up and then blame the people who are criticizing you.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.320]  Blame the people who actually want to stop this from happening again.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:40.280]  Despite virtually all of the perpetrators being asylum seekers and men from migrant backgrounds
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.400]  and they had to admit, it took them about six months to admit it was true, but they
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.800]  did eventually, and then the left came out and said, oh, but these aren't refugees, these
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:55.360]  aren't asylum seekers, although some of them were, these are people who've been in Germany
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.360]  for years.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.360]  Oh, great.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.240]  So these are the supposedly integrated migrants that are doing this.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.240]  Well, great.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.200]  That makes the problem even worse.
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.440]  What are you talking about?
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.760]  So after it was revealed, after they had to admit after about six months that it was
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:15.280]  mainly migrants, North African migrants, Germany's public broadcaster later released
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.400]  a documentary claiming the migrants were wrongly accused and that the real perpetrators were
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.160]  white German men.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.360]  We saw this elsewhere in Germany as well when the crime stats came out, when it came out
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.840]  that violent crimes against women particularly were through the roof and they did the same
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:33.840]  thing in Norway.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:39.920]  So it's like Norwegian drinking culture that's responsible for this.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.080]  Again, complete cover up.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.960]  Feminist groups in Cologne, you may remember this video, also responded by visiting the
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.760]  local refugee centre literally the day after and handing out roses to some of the very
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.440]  same migrants who may have been involved in the attacks in order to apologize for xenophobia.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:05.920]  So that was their first instinct after what was it up to a thousand women raped, sexually
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:11.240]  assaulted, groped, the local feminist chapter in Cologne, their first instinct was not to
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.720]  go on marches, decrying this, demanding it never happen again.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:22.040]  No, it was to go to the migrant centre and give them flowers.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.720]  And anyone who criticizes this was bad, we're bad for saying this that you can't sexually
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.760]  assault women on mass, we're bad.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.840]  Where's xenophobic, give roses to the actual migrants, some of whom would have been involved
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:33.840]  in these attacks.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:42.120]  Again, this is the fetishization of Islam, the alliance between the far left and Islam
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.160]  and that's seen no greater than in Germany itself.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.360]  Now as I mentioned earlier, the following year, of course they thought this was going
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.280]  to happen again, we'll get into what happened the following year, this is the Alex Show

[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:02.440]  Introducing FloraLife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.560]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:12.320]  Gut probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.840]  directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:20.320]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.560]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:29.400]  FloraLife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.840]  immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.920]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:40.520]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:45.200]  FloraLife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.560]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.800]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of FloraLife probiotics today.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.200]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.200]  I'm so excited.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:03.760]  The new product, InfoWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.360]  brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.800]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.760]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:23.080]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:29.400]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:34.480]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:41.080]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:45.520]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.240]  hormones in your glands.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.000]  It is amazing.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:59.960]  Red pill now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase, FuzzyOperation.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:20.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:24.960]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:34.960]  Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:46.120]  Well, live it is, December 29, 2017, as we edge closer to 2018, we're talking about a
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:52.040]  top story up at InfoWars.com, where German women in Berlin have been offered the use
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:56.520]  of safety zones during the New Year's Eve celebrations coming up here in a couple of
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:02.040]  days' time, ostensibly to protect them from migrant sex attacks.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.160]  We've gone through the history, we've pointed out that last year there was a huge police
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:10.600]  presence at Cologne, and these are the cities where, again, these migrant men turned up in
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.760]  their hundreds, looking for what, a repeat of the same thing that happened the year before
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:22.720]  in Cologne, when there were numerous sexual assaults, absolutely horrific rapes of women.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.800]  That's now looking like it may happen again, potentially.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:30.680]  So they're setting up these migrant, these women's safe zones to protect them from Muslim
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:37.320]  migrants ostensibly in Berlin, there at the Brandenburg Gate and iconic site.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.680]  But again, you know, I don't understand, but we're told that Muslim migrants are peaceful,
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.200]  they respect women.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.240]  So why do women need safe zones to prevent them from being sexually assaulted in major
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.240]  European cities?
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.840]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:57.280]  Jack Montgomery tweeted about this story, sharia by the back door, women-only party
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.960]  zones in Germany, women-only concerts in Sweden, women-only train carriages in Britain, that's
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:08.000]  being proposed, Westerners are being persuaded to accept Islamic cultural norms in the name
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.240]  of public safety.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:16.280]  Again, it's all about bending over backwards to their culture, even though some cultures
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.760]  are better than others, it's about complete capitulation.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:25.560]  And indeed, they asked a professor after the Cologne sex attacks in 2015, what he thought
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.560]  it was all about.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:32.000]  He said the attacks were meant to send a message to Europeans that they cannot protect their
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  women.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.280]  That was the psychological aspect behind it.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.120]  According to that professor, now we're seeing again, bending over backwards.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:44.560]  Not any national conversation about should we stop importing millions of these people
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.560]  every year.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.880]  They've had to do that actually in Germany now just because of the backlash.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.800]  But again, that's not the conversation.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.600]  The conversation is about again, bending over backwards, creating safety zone.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:01.480]  We don't need safety zones in major European cities during major celebratory events, New
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.480]  Year's Eve.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.600]  We should not need that in Western countries.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.600]  This is not Egypt.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.640]  This is not Tahir Square for God's sake.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:17.520]  But again, it's about acquiescing to an invasive culture, not reasserting our own culture and
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.800]  taking a look at these immigration policies that have caused this problem in the first
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.800]  place.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:25.960]  No, we can't talk about that because as the feminist said, who gave out roses to migrants
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:31.480]  the day after the mass militarization in Cologne, that would be xenophobic.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.560]  We have to have safe spaces.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.680]  Well, Viktor Orban has set up a similar of safe space.
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.680]  It's called Hungary.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:43.560]  This is out of Breitbart, except the will of the people on migration, culture or hit
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.560]  the road.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.760]  Orban tells Europe's leaders, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that Europeans
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:53.800]  are asserting their will by supporting leaders who reject mass migration and support Christian
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:58.960]  foundations and gave warning to politicians who deny the natural order of democracy.
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:04.000]  Of course, he's in alliance now with these other countries, especially Austria, Czech
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:11.480]  Republic and others that have this alliance, which is based around rejecting mass immigration.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.000]  You don't see terror attacks in Austria.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.400]  You don't see terror attacks in Hungary.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.960]  You don't see mass molestations of women in Hungary either.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.640]  The conservative Fidez party leader told Kossel the radio listeners that 2.3 million Hungarians
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:30.120]  took part in the national consultation against the George Soros-backed pro-mass migration
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:35.160]  plan and Mr. Orban now intends to spend the next few months convincing his opponents that
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.240]  Europe is right to protect her borders and her culture.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:43.600]  So will he be successful in using his own country as an example to say, look, we're
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.600]  peaceful.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:50.160]  Women can walk down the street at night without fear of being accosted and assaulted.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.320]  Do you want to be like us or do you want to continue down this path of disaster, of cultural
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.320]  suicide?
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.080]  Asked by the 180-minute host what made him think that after two years, since the migrant
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:06.600]  crisis, progressive leaders would listen now, Mr. Orban said, because in the meantime elections
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.920]  are being held in Europe, those who argue for a mixed population and to abolish societies
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.840]  based on national and Christian foundations in favour of living in multicultural societies
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.040]  are continually losing ground in national elections, Orban observed, because we saw
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.720]  that in no greater example than in Germany a couple of months ago with the AFD surging
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:32.280]  into third place, he went on to say European people will assert their will.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.960]  Look at the elections that have been held in Europe over the last few months, I think
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.280]  this process will intensify.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:41.800]  So Victor Orban set up a safe zone for women, it's called the entire country of Hungary
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.840]  because he's not following the same disastrous policies that created these problems in the
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.720]  first place.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:52.120]  London on the other hand, different story.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.760]  This is also out of Breitbart headline, delivery drivers reveal London no-go zones made too
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:00.680]  dangerous to work by acid attacks and knife crimes.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.720]  Of course we had postal workers in Sweden repeatedly a few months ago and again more
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:10.880]  recently come out and say look we can't do deliveries to certain no-go zones in Sweden
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:15.160]  which don't exist according to the left in the media, Euro-Xenophobia or bigger if you
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.880]  say they do, but the delivery drivers in Sweden are saying we're not going to go here.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:25.080]  The police are installing microphones on the streets to pick up the screaming of women
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.720]  being raped because they can't have police stations in the area because they just get
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.640]  attacked and fire bombed.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.080]  But again it's all conspiracy theory, no-go zones don't exist.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.880]  Well delivery drivers have branded large parts of London no-go zones in which acid attacks
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.960]  and rampant knife crime have made them too fearful to work.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.280]  Again the no-go zones that they say don't exist, you're a conspiracy theorist as enophobic
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.520]  bigger if you say they do exist.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.920]  The frequency of assaults using carotid liquid in the city, officially the world capital
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:59.480]  of reported acid attacks has left drivers choosing to take a big pay cut rather than
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.200]  braving dangerous areas of London at night.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.480]  So this would be very lucrative for some of these drivers but they're saying we're just
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.000]  not going to do this, it's too dangerous now.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  A quote, we used to work till 2am, now people are stopping before 10pm one moped driver
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.080]  revealed to the sun, after 8pm or 9pm we're not going to those dangerous places.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:26.680]  Now they found out what exactly areas they refused to go to and well imagine my shock,
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:32.920]  it was Hackney, it was Stoke Newington, Boroughs which local MP Diane Abbott both saw ethnically
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:38.280]  drivers, noting just 36% of residents describe themselves as white British.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:44.400]  Another area described as one to avoid by the drivers is Bess Null Green in East London
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:51.200]  which lies in the corruption plagued Islamist connected borough of Tower Hamlets, again
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:55.760]  where the white population is basically shrunk to about 30%, white people, white British
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.920]  people are a minority in London across the entire city.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.960]  These are the areas in which these acid attacks are taking place, also named by the drivers
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:09.680]  were regenerated regions such as Elephant and Castle and Stratford, the latter of which
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:17.640]  police say is hit by child sex grooming gangs, so again, you know, diverse culturally enriched
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:23.280]  lovely places to live, sex grooming gangs, acid attacks and the like.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:27.600]  US President Donald J. Trump has previously called attention to some of the problems faced
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.840]  by Britain and its capital city as a result of mass immigration, especially that of terror
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.680]  attacks committed by Islamic extremists and of course, what was the reaction to that?
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.800]  Well, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who calls London a beacon of diversity said that
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:46.040]  Donald Trump was not welcome because he dared to tell the truth.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.440]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones show live in the next segment breaking news at infowars.com.
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.240]  Don't go away.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:59.120]  It's a no brainer, a big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.640]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine

[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.480]  I often say some cultures are better than others.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.680]  Now we have this headline out of the independent Pakistani woman gang raped on orders of village
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.680]  council after marrying man of her choice.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.680]  Sounds really reasonable.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:32.680]  That doesn't it.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:36.320]  A woman in Pakistan has been gang raped on the orders of a village council after she
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.440]  married a man of her own choice according to local media.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.800]  The alleged assault occurred in a city district.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.200]  I cannot pronounce and won't even attempt to do so.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:50.040]  Near Faisalabad, less than 100 miles from Pakistan's border with India, they expressed
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:52.160]  Tribune reported.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.400]  News have reportedly arrested three suspects, including two brothers, over the rape of the
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.640]  19-year-old woman.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:02.440]  The teenager said in a press conference her father had brought her back home after village
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:06.720]  council members promised the family could give her away in a traditional ceremony.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:13.240]  Again, this is the culture we're importing into the West and the left says it's so progressive.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.440]  But the council allegedly kept her captive and allowed three men to rape her.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.720]  Again, perfectly reasonable.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:22.520]  The news channel reported she later escaped captivity.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:26.400]  DNA testing reportedly confirmed she was gang raped, a family of appeal to authorities
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.040]  to hold the council members responsible.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.680]  But again, maybe that's just part of their culture.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.920]  We shouldn't be xenophobic bigots and say that gang raping women as a punishment for
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:40.120]  them wanting to marry the husband of their choice is a bad thing.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.160]  No, we should be progressive.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.720]  We should tolerate that.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.720]  Not just tolerate it.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.720]  Let's bring it in.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:51.000]  Let's start saying that the hijab is a symbol of feminism, even though the very first feminist
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.360]  groups in the Middle East tore it off in protest, even though people in ISIS-occupied areas
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:02.560]  of Syria and Iraq, the first thing they do when they're liberated from ISIS is remove
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:03.560]  the hijab.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.720]  No, it's progressive.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.440]  We should tolerate it, not just tolerate it, but promote it.
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:13.920]  Now, we have gang rape being sanctioned by local councils, and this has obviously been
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.520]  happening for decades.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:21.120]  In Pakistan, so why do you think when we import these people, they think it's perfectly fine
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:26.920]  to sexually assault women who don't wear the veil, but then let's fetishize the veil.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:29.240]  Let's embrace it, which is what the left is doing.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:36.320]  Let's have Barbie dolls released, hijab Barbie to normalize it all, when this is the culture
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.840]  from which it emerges.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:43.880]  Now, I've quoted Muslim reformists, people who were in a position to know and say, no,
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.800]  this is the modesty culture.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.480]  The gang rape springs from the exact same well that the hijab does.
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:51.800]  But no, let's embrace the hijab.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:57.560]  Let's exalt Linda Sarsour as the leader of the resistance, even as she tweets about
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:03.520]  removing the vagina of her critics of Ayan Hirsi Ali, who's been targeted to death, for
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.360]  death by Islamic extremists.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:08.040]  No, let's exalt those people.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.920]  Let's buy hijab Barbie, and let's normalize all this.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.120]  That's what the left wants to do.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.360]  That's why they've allied with Islamists.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.480]  That's why ISIS in its own manifesto said, hey, we broadly share the same goals that
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.560]  the far left in America does.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.240]  They want to bring down America.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.600]  They want to bring down the capitalist system.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.600]  So do we.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.840]  Let's recruit them.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.280]  Let's give them weapons.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:35.520]  That was in their own propaganda leaflet that they put out.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.520]  We reported on it.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.640]  Then you had, of course, the FBI field member, which we reported on, where they said, Antifa
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:47.480]  members were going out to Syria and other places and meeting with Islamic terrorists
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:48.640]  for training.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.800]  That was an FBI field manual.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:53.720]  We put it in a recent article about that subject.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:57.320]  So that's why they're aligning because they broadly share the same beliefs, because I'm
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:58.320]  not talking about liberals.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:05.120]  I'm talking about the far left, the militant Antifa types broadly sharing the same goals,
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.160]  the destruction of Western civilization as Islamic radicals.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:14.960]  So is it any surprise that they're glorifying, that they're embracing, that they're promoting
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:21.920]  this kind of modesty culture that leads to the gang rape of women by local council decree
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.960]  in countries like Pakistan?
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.040]  Some cultures are better than others.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:33.800]  CNBC reports terror attacks are likely to increase in 2018 with ISIS and al Qaeda both
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.800]  still dangerous.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:39.520]  The caliphate may be in ruins, but that doesn't mean ISIS is gone forever.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.040]  Terror attacks are likely to increase in 2018 as the destruction of the Islamic State's
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:48.720]  physical stronghold in Iraq and Syria will strengthen its will to strike out abroad,
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:50.600]  experts say.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.440]  ISIS will want to show that they're still in the fight and their followers remain as
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:59.240]  fanatical as ever, said Louis VIII, a former British Army intelligence officer.
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:03.320]  The number of attacks globally will likely increase as the group switches focus from
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:06.200]  the war in the Middle East to international terrorism.
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.520]  Adam Dean, Executive Director of the Counter-extremism think tank Quillian, makes a similar argument.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:15.840]  He said, quote, we're going to see without a doubt more attacks in the West.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.760]  Dean said ISIS is now more focused on revenge and warned against the false sense of victory
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:23.720]  that many expressed after the death of Osama bin Laden.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:29.320]  So ISIS is losing its territory in Syria and Iraq thanks to Trump dropping bombs on them
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:33.440]  rather than leaflets, which is what the Obama administration did.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:38.240]  So they're all making their way back to the European countries from which they emerged.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.560]  And we're letting them in, we're rolling out the red carpet and say, by all means, not
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.440]  only come back in, but we'll give you welfare, we'll give you housing, we'll give you jobs.
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.480]  Meanwhile, people who've actually lived in Britain and fought for Britain in sporting
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.600]  events, patriotic people are being deported.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:59.280]  Oh, but if you're an ISIS jihadist, you can come straight back in, you know, Sadiq Khan
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:05.960]  says Donald Trump's not welcome, while literally he's over 400 ISIS jihadists have poured
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:11.240]  back into the UK while we face this unprecedented threat, while we have jihadists roaming the
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:18.080]  streets after three major terror attacks this year in the UK alone.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:24.440]  Now we have the highest proportion of ISIS jihadists being allowed back into the country.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:25.440]  Insanity.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.920]  We'll be back in the next segment to talk about it.
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:34.080]  We'll also talk about what happened in Cairo today when more Christians were massacred
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.040]  by an Islamic extremist.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:41.960]  This is the ideology that we're importing in the West, that the far left is embracing.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:43.960]  It has to stop.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.960]  This is the Alex Giorgio Library News at infowars.com.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:46.960]  We'll be back.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:55.880]  We'll be back, don't worry.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:01.880]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.480]  probiotic.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:10.200]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:17.880]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:22.840]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:29.520]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:34.080]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.600]  probiotic on the market.

[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.000]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.840]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.640]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.480]  particles in the gut.
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.920]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:20.000]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.040]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:27.600]  You can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.360]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:34.600]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:38.600]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.920]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:45.600]  you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.680]  Don't let a meal go to waste, use carnivore by info wars life.

[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:23.120]  pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:27.800]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:30.880]  every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.560]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:38.560]  gain and overall brain fog.

[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.160]  and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:14.360]  fantastic and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the Info War.
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:19.000]  It might seem like a simple thing but they particularly these slogan t-shirts that you
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.720]  guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:27.080]  Well thank you, my favorite new one is the don't tread on me but said it says won't tread
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.720]  on me and it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake and then it's got the American flag
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:33.440]  infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:39.080]  I mean that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:40.080]  free speech.
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:45.640]  The newest one is trigger warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt which is the symbol
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:50.120]  of a trigger with a yield sign and then infowars.com on the back.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:47:00.040]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:17.040]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:26.040]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:36.920]  We're live, it is the Alex Jones show December 29, 2017 edition before you get back into
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:37.920]  the news.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:42.400]  I want to tell you about two great products we have at infowarsstore.com and this really
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.160]  helps us out when you get these products.
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:51.440]  We have the real red pill, 50% off for the holiday season, it's part of that New Year's
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.600]  discount special.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:59.320]  Other competitors products are as much as $100 but we're excited about this formula
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:05.960]  so we want you to try it a two month supply for only $39.95 so it's basically less than
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:09.200]  $20 a month supply for this.
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.320]  Without the essential building blocks, amino acids and hormone precursor, pregnenolone,
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:17.720]  your body is unable to even create the basic hormones it needs to operate.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:21.880]  This is the true ultimate building block, the missing link that is overlooked across
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:26.320]  the board, consulting top scientists, physicians, researchers, we have put together the real
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.320]  red pill.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:32.680]  It's one of a kind, all new heart and brain formula designed specifically and exclusively
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:34.760]  for infowars life.
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:40.080]  The main ingredient here is pregnenolone, a little known neuro steroid with so much
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.160]  potential and science behind it.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.800]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, studies have shown that levels can decline by as much
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.720]  as 60% between the ages of 20 and 75.
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:54.320]  So without these essential building blocks, your body lacks what it needs to function
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:59.440]  at optimal levels and studies have shown that low levels of pregnenolone are associated
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:03.400]  with fatigue, low brain function and unhealthy aging.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:07.880]  So this is really going to give you the boost that you need, it's going to give you that
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.480]  missing ingredient that your body just doesn't have.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:14.400]  Now, although it's called a neuro steroid, it's actually totally safe, pregnenolone
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.640]  is generally regarded as safe in the US and allowed for all athletes internationally
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:21.280]  by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.880]  The real red pill also provides, we always pack these products with it as much as we
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:26.880]  can.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.560]  It also provides essential trace minerals and B vitamins that are all required for
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:33.600]  optimal cognitive function and heart health.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.880]  I need to get some of this ASAP, these vitamins and minerals work synergistically with pregnenolone
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:43.520]  to deliver results that you will have to experience for yourself to believe.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:50.040]  Look at the five star reviews over at InfowarsStore.com again, their independent third-party reviews
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:54.960]  overseen by a third-party site, not ours, we can't just delete bad reviews if we get
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:00.120]  them, they are the best reviews because that's organically what people are saying about
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.120]  this product.
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:06.760]  It is the real red pill, 50% off for the holiday season, again, support this network by getting
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:11.760]  the real red pill at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:16.360]  We also have Carnivore, the all-new enzyme formula, which is 33% off again as part of
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.200]  the Christmas special.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:22.920]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfowarsLife at 33% off
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:23.920]  again.
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:28.800]  Combining that with the healthy heart, the cognitive functioning, the digestive enzyme
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.840]  assist that you get with this product, again, is key in the digestion process, increases
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:39.560]  the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:42.000]  Again, that's a major issue.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.600]  With food, sometimes you can't get the nutrients or vitamins out of it because your body can't
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:46.800]  break them down.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:52.240]  Sometimes they're toxic in some cases, so this helps the body with that function.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:56.360]  Digestive enzymes also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:02.040]  undigested food particles in the gut, so if you've got a problem with the stomach pains
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:05.640]  in digestion, then this could be a big help for you.
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:13.400]  It is Carnivore, 33% off with the Christmas special discount right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:18.320]  Please support this network as it's under constant attack by getting the products.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.840]  Again, I'm at this point over and over again.
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:25.200]  The reason they were able to take down other networks or at least hamstring them is because
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:28.760]  those networks were dependent on outside advertising.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:34.360]  I'm talking about the likes of Breitbart when they have huge leftist, autistic, screeching
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:39.680]  boycott campaigns against certain news outlets, against certain companies, they're successful
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:46.640]  to a certain extent because those outside advertisers just cave to the pressure.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:50.960]  They don't know that it's an organized boycott, they just freak out and pull their advertising.
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:52.160]  We're not reliant on that.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:55.800]  We're not dependent on that because we have these products in-house.
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:52:00.480]  We're only dependent on you, and you as our audience, we know you're not going to be influenced
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:06.920]  by unhinged, screeching leftist outrage mobs that try and bring down different opinions
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.440]  by sabotaging them financially.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:12.680]  Of course, we've had that happen in other areas, but not with the products because we're
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:20.200]  only dependent on you, and that is why we appreciate you getting those products at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.720]  Let's get back into a few news stories.
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:26.920]  I'm going to save the freak out over Trump's global warming tweet until the top of the
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:28.600]  hour because that's going to be a long one.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:31.560]  Let's get into a few small stories right now.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:34.560]  Government kills nine in attack on Egypt Church.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:37.440]  Again, the Coptic Christians being slaughtered.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:41.920]  This is barely even a news story anymore because it becomes so prevalent.
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:46.920]  A government open fire on a church south of Cairo on Friday killing at least nine people.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:51.280]  In the latest apparently, he had his attack on the country's Christian minority.
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:57.840]  Again, people don't care about minorities when they're not Muslims or in other cases,
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:00.920]  but faith when it's Christians, who cares, right?
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:01.920]  They're Christians.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:06.280]  That's the general attitude amongst many on the left because these attacks are so common
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:07.280]  place now.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.560]  They're being ignored.
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:13.160]  Health Ministry spokesman Khalid Magad said, to state television, the gunman was shot dead
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:17.560]  after killing nine people and wounding others, including a police officer.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:22.200]  But the Interior Ministry said in a statement that the assailant wanted jihadists implicated
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.640]  in attacks on police had been wounded and arrested.
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:30.880]  One footage posted on social media appeared to show the bearded gunman wearing a bulky
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:35.720]  ammunition vest sprawled on a street, barely conscious as people restrained his arms and
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.480]  then handcuffed him.
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:42.400]  The Islamic state group's affiliate in Egypt has killed dozens of Christians in church bombings
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:47.520]  and shootings over the past year and has threatened further attacks against the minority.
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:54.080]  Again, huge amounts of Christians being driven out of the Middle East, being driven out of
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:57.040]  North Africa, and again, it's barely a footnote.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.600]  What's the biggest story of the year?
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:01.520]  Oh, it's the Me Too movement.
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:03.600]  This has never been the biggest story of the year.
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:08.000]  It's been the biggest story of the year for the past 10 years, even since the Iraq war
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.240]  when Christians were driven out of the region.
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:14.040]  But again, now it's barely a footnote.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:18.640]  Spotnik News reports, US reportedly evacuates Daesh leaders, that's ISIS.
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:23.160]  I don't know why news organizations continue to use the term Daesh because it just confuses
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:24.160]  people.
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:25.160]  It's ISIS.
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:32.400]  Leaders from Syria's Dayazor region again, US helicopters have evacuated ISIS leaders
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:37.840]  from several areas across the Syrian province of Dayazor to the country's northeast, Syria's
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.160]  Sana'at news agency has reported.
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:47.080]  Now, remember a few days ago, we had the Russian general come out and say, why are ISIS Jihad
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:51.160]  is still being trained by the US military in Syria?
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:55.920]  We've got elements of the deep state, which Trump obviously has no control over, that
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:01.560]  still wants to overthrow Assad as part of that disastrous regime change policy that Hillary
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:03.560]  Clinton and Obama were following.
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:09.200]  And in some areas, they're still training and protecting ISIS Jihadists.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:13.360]  Remember the whole, oh, should we arm the Syrian rebels debate when the Syrian rebels
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:18.960]  were in alliance to, were defecting to ISIS for years while that was still going on?
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:22.640]  Well, now it appears that they're protecting them.
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:23.800]  They're evacuating them.
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:25.960]  They're getting them to safety to get medical treatment.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:30.320]  The article continues, Sana'a reported that according to residents, the Jihadists were
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:36.320]  evacuated Wednesday and flown to safety in Al-Hassika province, much of which is presently
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:39.760]  under the control of Kurdish and US forces.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:44.920]  Sources said that several US helicopters had conducted low altitude flights into the
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:51.280]  Alsat camp for temporarily displaced persons landing near the Al-Hassika dam in southern
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:56.440]  Al-Hassika province, bringing in terrorist leaders reported to have joined a new group
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:00.160]  of militants supported and organized by the US.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:05.240]  So obviously they're going to label them something different than ISIS and say, oh, these are
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:06.240]  the moderates.
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:07.360]  They're still Jihadists.
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.520]  They're all Jihadists.
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.040]  They're all in league with each other.
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:14.600]  They either fight each other to see who can control the caliphate or they're just defected
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.600]  to each other.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.760]  And in some cases, it appears that the US elements of the deep state are still not only training
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:25.280]  but protecting those rebels when they need medical treatment.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:29.160]  In recent months, the Syrian government has repeatedly accused Washington of providing
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:33.840]  various forms of support for ISIS and other terrorist groups operating in Syria, including
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:39.280]  intelligence which allowed militants to attack Syrian army positions.
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:44.560]  So again, they're giving intelligence to the terrorists who are attacking the Syrian army.
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:48.040]  According to Damascus, US air power has been used on numerous occasions to rescue terrorist
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:53.120]  leaders from their imminent destruction at the hands of the Syrian army and even to stage
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:58.920]  accidental attacks on Syrian forces as they advanced against the militants.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.880]  So because back at the start of the year, we had this huge furore over Trump bombing
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:04.120]  the Syrian airfield.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:09.640]  Again, that was his deep state handlers convincing him to follow the same disastrous policy that
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:14.600]  Obama and Hillary Clinton have been following, that the likes of John McCain support too.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:20.400]  It appears that at least in some areas of Syria, that policy is continuing with these
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:24.840]  rescues of ISIS fighters but they're just going to label them moderate rebels, they're
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:28.440]  going to call them by a different name and everyone's going to look the other way.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:33.560]  But certainly Syria and Russia are ringing the alarm bell over it once again.
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:38.040]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show to talk about how the left is
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:42.280]  freaking out over, you guessed it, Donald Trump's tweet once again.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:46.160]  We'll be back, don't go away.
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:52.480]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States powerful 50 billion live organism
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:58:00.480]  probiotic fluorolive that is so critical to having a healthy gut and a healthy life and
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:03.760]  that has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:09.040]  The other part is a compound like Myco ZX that has all these key ingredients of organic
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:13.520]  herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:17.680]  That's why as we go through Christmas and now into the new year, we're extending the
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:23.200]  free shipping and 50% off on all our bestselling items while supplies last.
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:30.360]  You can also get the two products together and get them at 50% off when you combo them.
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:32.560]  So popular, sold out for more than six months.
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:37.920]  Now back in stock for limited time at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:38.920]  AAA-2533139.
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:52.680]  Introducing Fluorolive, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLive after
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:55.360]  years of research on the human microbiome.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:57.800]  Not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:02.000]  Fluorolive probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.120]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:10.600]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:15.200]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:19.640]  Fluorolive supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:22.120]  immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:26.200]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:31.040]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:35.480]  Fluorolive is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care, and a 50 billion
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:38.840]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:49.520]  Head to InfoWarsLive.com to pick up your bottle of Fluorolive probiotics today, that's InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:59:49.520 --> 02:00:06.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:12.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:22.240]  We're live, and once again, Donald J. Trump has trolled the left with one of his tweets
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:25.840]  and seized control of the news narrative.
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:28.680]  This headline is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:32.840]  Trump global warming tweet prompts mass triggering.
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:36.400]  President Trump's tweet poking fun at global warming alarmists has prompted a mass triggering
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:42.360]  with the blue check Mark Brigade, once again, losing its stuff over Trump trolling.
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:47.080]  Trump tweeted the following late last night, here's the tweet, from Donald J. Trump.
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:51.440]  He said, quote, in the East, it could be the coldest New Year's Eve on record.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:55.120]  Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old global warming that our country,
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:00.360]  but not other countries, was going to pay trillions of dollars to protect against.
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:01.360]  Bundle up.
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:06.960]  Oh, you can imagine the seething, autistic screeching that immediately followed this
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:07.960]  tweet.
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:14.240]  A selection of those tweets in this article, and again, this is the overarching point.
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:18.760]  They use weather to prove global warming when it goes in their favor.
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:23.600]  Whenever we have a hot summer, whenever we have a heat wave, the left, the global warming
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:27.240]  alarmist pointed at it and say, oh, look, this is proof of global warming.
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:28.920]  It's so hot.
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:34.160]  Trump does the same, the same thing, but on the flip side said, look how cold it is.
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:35.920]  Maybe we need some more global warming.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:37.800]  They say, how dare you?
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:38.800]  You're unscientific.
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:39.800]  Bigger.
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:45.400]  How dare you claim that weather has any relation to long-term climatic trends?
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.200]  That's what they do every single frigging summer.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:54.200]  In fact, you had Chris Silesa from CNN tweet in response to this.
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:58.800]  He said, quote, by the Trump logic, a warm summer would be in controversial evidence
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.920]  that climate change is real.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:07.600]  That's literally what the left claims every time there's a warm summer, they want to have
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.680]  their cake and eat it.
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:14.760]  Of course, they also claim that cold winters are part of global warming.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:19.760]  They claim that mild winters are part of global warming, just any weather whatsoever, any
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:24.520]  kind of hurricane season, any kind of extreme weather event, whether there are a few of
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.840]  them, whether there are lots of them.
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:32.320]  Either way, it all proves that man-made global warming is real and you need to give us your
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:33.800]  tax money to sort it out.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:39.040]  You need to give us those lucrative government grants over and over again.
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.520]  You need to pay those exorbitant, soaring electricity bills.
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:48.920]  I, Spain, look at Spain, for example, they had a green economy all based around this
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:54.480]  pseudo-scientific fraud, 25% unemployment rate.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.560]  That's what it resulted in.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:59.720]  It resulted in a 50% unemployment rate for young people.
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:05.640]  They've got abandoned factories all over the country crumbling, falling apart, and they're
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:09.200]  all reliant on green energy, which is largely useless.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:14.880]  It takes more energy to power a wind turbine than the actual energy you get from it.
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:17.000]  And what's the result?
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.400]  Exorbitant, skyrocketing electricity prices.
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:25.360]  I have to pay my parents' electricity bill because they can't even afford to pay it on
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:26.360]  their pension.
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:29.440]  They live in Spain.
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:30.440]  Only out of control.
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:36.760]  But now Trump dares tweet about it in a jokey fashion and the Blue Checkmark Brigade just
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:37.760]  lose their stuff.
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:39.880]  I mean, let's go back to this article.
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:42.960]  Let's see some of these responses, the mass triggering.
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.040]  Daniel Dale said it's funny when Trump made his Paris court announcement, the White House
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:50.600]  evaded for days as reporters asked whether the president still believes global warming
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.600]  is fake.
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.760]  He just tweeted it out.
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:54.760]  David Frum.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:57.440]  This is what David Frum said.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.400]  Now bear in mind, David Frum is a neocon.
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:06.400]  He was George W. Bosch's speech writer before the invasion of Iraq.
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:09.480]  He responded to this, and this is a funny thing that you see now.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:16.000]  All these neocons trying to come back to prominence, having had their ideas completely annihilated
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  by the course of history, they're trying to come back to prominence by ingratiating themselves
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.440]  with the far left.
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:27.400]  David Frum said, when the alien archeologists study the ruins of human civilization, this
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:30.320]  will take a prominent place in their notebooks.
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.640]  That's George W. Bosch's speech writer for the invasion of Iraq.
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:39.440]  You know, if anyone knows about ruining civilizations, it's David Frum.
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:42.040]  Unbelievable, we'll get more into this.
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:46.040]  On the other side, this is the Alex Cherm Show, why breaking news at infowars.com.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:53.040]  Don't go away.
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:56.720]  Mike in Arizona here on the air worldwide.
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:57.720]  Go ahead.
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:00.080]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:03.720]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:10.520]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:15.840]  And as a longtime infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:16.840]  Anthroplex.
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:19.120]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex.
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:20.120]  Thank you.
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:24.280]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:25.280]  toothpaste fans.
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:27.120]  The super blue is awesome.
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:30.040]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the infowars life products.
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:31.240]  They are quality.
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:33.200]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:36.160]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:37.160]  Absolutely.
[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:42.960]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:47.520]  that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:06:14.360]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:20.920]  Whenever we have a hot summer, whenever we have a heat wave, the left sides it as proof
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:25.760]  that manmade global warming is real, that we need to hand over more of our tax dollars
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:31.960]  to solve it, that we need to support the scientists who get by with lucrative government grants
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:37.840]  year after year after year, pushing this pseudo science.
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:41.720]  So weather proves global warming if it's hot and if you're arguing for manmade global
[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:46.560]  warming, but try and flip that around and say, look how cold it is, doesn't this disprove
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:47.720]  global warming?
[02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:53.440]  How dare you challenge our orthodoxy, they will come after you.
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:57.360]  This is what's happening right now in the aftermath of this Donald Trump tweet.
[02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:02.600]  We have Al Gore, of course, who was one of the cult leaders for this entire ideology
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:06.200]  stretching back over a decade now.
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:10.720]  Al Gore came out and predicted over and over again that the North Pole would be completely
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:11.720]  ice free.
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:16.400]  He's been proven wrong again and again and again, which is the point.
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:22.120]  All these climate scientists, Al Gore, whoever you want to look at, Paul Ehrlich, all of them,
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:28.120]  going back to the 60s, they all predicted catastrophe and they all cited certain dates
[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:30.360]  by which that catastrophe would happen.
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:32.000]  None of it happened.
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  They were caught lying, deceiving over and over again.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.880]  Why is anyone still listening to these people?
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:44.080]  I remember being a kid, being like eight, nine, 10 years old, and hearing on the news,
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:50.160]  oh, the North of England is going to be like the South of France within 15 years, but complete
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:51.160]  BS.
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:54.400]  Obviously, you have minor fluctuations in temperature.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:59.280]  You have big fluctuations in temperature in climate, depending on the behavior, the activity
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:03.000]  of the sun, which is the biggest driver of climate.
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:08.680]  Even the UN's own reports, even their own bias reports, say that human activities responsible
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:15.120]  for about 6% of temperature change over the course of about 100 years.
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:17.120]  Even those figures are skewed.
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:22.880]  We have the decline scandal, the whole climate gate issue, where they were caught changing
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:26.560]  temperature measurements to fit in with their doctrine.
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:27.560]  These are liars.
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:28.560]  These are deceivers.
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.480]  These are pseudo scientists.
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:33.440]  We have this article out of Gateway Pundit.
[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:37.600]  We flashed back to this every year because he's been proven wrong every single year.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:44.200]  Nine years ago, Al Gore predicted North Pole would be completely ice-free by today.
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:48.280]  Nine years ago this month, Al Gore predicted the North Polar Ice Cap would be completely
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.840]  ice-free in five years.
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:53.800]  Gore made the prediction to a German audience in 2008.
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:57.560]  He told them the entire North Polar Ice Cap will disappear in five years.
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:03.400]  In fact, we have a video of this, which we can go to in a second, where he made the same
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:09.840]  prediction in 2009 that the North Polar Ice Cap would be completely ice-free, would be
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:13.640]  completely disappeared, melted, by now.
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:14.640]  It didn't happen.
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:15.640]  Let's go to this clip.
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:16.640]  This is from 2009.
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:17.640]  This is Al Gore.
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:18.640]  Here it is.
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:30.240]  Some of the models suggest to Dr. Mazlowski that there is a 75% chance that the entire
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:38.920]  North Polar Ice Cap during some of the summer months could be completely ice-free within
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:41.600]  the next five to seven years.
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:48.680]  Within the next five to seven years, again, that was 2009, so he said by 2016, 2017, the
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:53.400]  North Pole would be completely ice-free in the summer, it would be completely melted.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:56.320]  He said that for numerous different years as well.
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.320]  It didn't happen.
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:03.280]  In fact, at the end of the summer this year, we had this article out of zero hedge in convenient
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:07.360]  record Arctic sea ice growth in September.
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:10.280]  So again, you've had the same thing for the Arctic, the North Pole.
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:15.400]  We've had expansions, rapid expansions in sea ice, depending, again, on the behavior,
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:17.120]  the activity of the sun.
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:22.360]  Yes, sometimes it shrinks down, sometimes it rapidly expands.
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:26.160]  But again, we're seeing it again after this Trump tweet where they're all claiming, oh,
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:30.920]  the weather's not proof of climate change, oh, but it is if we say it is in summer, because
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:33.000]  that goes in our favor.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.560]  What's up with that, which is a scientific blog, breaks it down with a headline, record
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:39.600]  breaking winter cold.
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:42.960]  Don't worry, the climate explainers have it covered.
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:47.240]  The article reads, does record breaking winter cold cast doubt on climate predictions of
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:48.880]  milder winters?
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:53.840]  So again, remember, global warming was supposed to bring us milder winters.
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:58.040]  Should any weather or climate shift cast doubt on the dominance of that wicked little trace
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:03.120]  molecule, carbon dioxide, apparently not according to leading climate explainers.
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:05.840]  It's cold outside, but that doesn't mean climate change isn't real.
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:08.200]  That's a headline out of USA Today.
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:14.320]  So what happens if global temperatures take a real plunge for a sustained period?
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:18.320]  Don't worry, the explainers have that one covered as well, but they've got everything
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:19.320]  covered.
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:21.880]  It's cold, it's mild, it's hot.
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:24.600]  Extreme weather events, no extreme weather events have got it all covered.
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:25.600]  It's all global warming.
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:28.720]  Whatever happens, just conveniently, it's all global warming.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:32.000]  Shut up, don't talk about it, you're a denier.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.200]  James Hansen.
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:39.560]  Now he was on this whole Gaia train where they basically said that part of the human
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:43.360]  population may need to be wiped out for the good of the earth.
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:49.280]  James Hansen, former NASA GISS director, published a paper which suggests global warming will
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:54.200]  trigger a short ice age in the near future.
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:59.080]  If we get an ice age, that's also because of global warming and your sinful lifestyle.
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:03.560]  It's your fault for having too many hot baths, as Prince Charles once said while he lives
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:07.560]  in opulent luxury in mansions around the world.
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:10.280]  They've got all the bases covered.
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:14.920]  Global warming is an infinitely flexible, unscientific, unfalsifiable theory which can
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:18.440]  be stretched to accommodate any observation.
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:23.320]  Some climate scientists even shamelessly reject the very concept of scientific falsification
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:26.000]  with regards to the conduct of climate science.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:31.320]  So no matter what happens to the weather, the climate explainer shamelessly cobbled together
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:37.040]  an explanation which blames bad weather on your sinful lifestyle.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:42.520]  It's all your fault and whatever the weather does, that's proof of global warming.
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:47.360]  Whatever the observation, the climate explainers have their theory, their infinitely adaptable
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:49.440]  theory which they claim is science.
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:51.760]  Warm weather confirms their worst fears.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:53.720]  Cold weather is waved away.
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:58.440]  Whatever the observation, the explainer shamelessly adapt their theory to provide an explanation
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:04.000]  based on their scientific theory which cannot be falsified by any conceivable observations
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.240]  even in a brook plunge into a new ice age.
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:14.440]  So even if we had a new ice age that lasted for decades, they would still continue to insist
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:19.360]  that global warming was responsible, oh and by the way, these are the same people who
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:26.480]  back in the 70s, you had Time Magazine, Newsweek, a front page cover stories about this who back
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:33.320]  in the 70s were saying that there was going to be a massive trend of global cooling, that
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:37.840]  that was what humanity was responsible for, that's what we had to tackle in the decades
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:38.840]  going forward.
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:45.000]  And again, proven spectacularly wrong, so why is anyone listening to them now?
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.840]  Look at this headline out of the sky, new scientists predict mini ice age could hit
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:54.840]  UK by 2030, a mini ice age that would freeze major rivers, could hit Britain in less than
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:14:01.480]  two decades, according to research from universities in the UK and Russia, they see a flashback
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:07.480]  headline where they predicted a global cooling back in the 70s were proven completely wrong.
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:12.680]  But now a mathematical model of the sun's magnetic activity again, the sun is the main
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:18.200]  driver of climate suggests temperatures could start dropping here from 2021 with the potential
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.360]  for winter skating on the River Thames by 2030.
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:26.080]  When did we last have skating on the River Thames?
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:32.440]  It was during the last mini ice age, what now 400 years ago, where we have artist representations
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:37.520]  of people ice skating on the River Thames in London, because it was a period called the
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:41.600]  Mourn de Minimum where sun activity was low.
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:48.360]  Again, the sun is the main driver of the climate, a team led by math professor Valentina Zarkova
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:53.360]  at Northumbria University built on work from Moscow to predict the movements of two magnetic
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:59.640]  waves produced by the sun, it predicts rapidly decreasing magnetic waves for three solar cycles
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:06.600]  beginning in 2021, the lasting 33 years, very low magnetic activity on the sun corresponds
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:11.560]  with historically documented cold periods on Earth.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:16.000]  You could go through history, hundreds and hundreds of years ago, we swung wildly between
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:22.320]  warm periods and cold periods, they see Time Magazine, the global warming survival guide.
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.880]  The current propaganda phase is global warming.
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:28.360]  If we have a mini ice age, they'll just switch it back and say, oh, by the way, you're also
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:30.160]  responsible for this.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:36.000]  Whatever happens, ice age, heat wave, cold weather, hot weather, you're to blame, give
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.080]  us your money, stop having hot baths, wear the elite, we're going to tell you how to

[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:58.800]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:02.880]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's

[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:25.920]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:26.920]  That's true.
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:30.600]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:31.920]  alive?

[02:17:55.080 --> 02:18:01.680]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:07.040]  water supply that are making us fat, sick and stupid.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:08.400]  So what do we do about it?
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:11.840]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.

[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:53.520]  while supplies last.
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:56.800]  Let's get back into some of this news talking before the break about global warming and
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:22:06.160]  the left asserting how much they love science, how scientific they are, how bigoted, uninformed.
[02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:11.640]  In some cases now they're claiming that Trump's mentally ill because he made fun of global
[02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:17.440]  warming because he suggested for a moment he committed the thought crime that it may
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:22.520]  not actually be a thing given these massively cold temperatures we're experiencing, not
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:27.800]  just in America, but also in many parts of Europe, but the left, they're all about science,
[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:28.800]  right?
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:33.560]  They stand on the side of science unless you're talking about gender and sexuality, in which
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:40.600]  case there are 75 different genders, in which case chromosomes don't determine sex.
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:42.480]  That's what they literally said.
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:44.200]  These are the scientists.
[02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:46.400]  These are the pro-science leftists.
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:49.800]  They stand firmly on the side of science.
[02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:50.800]  They're meticulous.
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:53.960]  They also say that chromosomes don't determine sex.
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:56.680]  Yes, this is actually a news story.
[02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:01.440]  Biology professor lectures state rep on sex determination stuff.
[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:07.880]  The San Jose State University biology professor recently accused the Texas state legislator
[02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:12.160]  of being bigoted for tweeting that there are only two genders.
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:13.800]  How dare he?
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:18.480]  In case you forgot how many genders there are, that's the tone in which they tweet.
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:24.920]  Human state representative Abrisco was hit back, but the backlash was monumental after
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:29.080]  he attached a picture of the XX and XY chromosomes.
[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:32.440]  He committed that particular thought crime.
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:38.360]  Describing herself as a geneticist, Rachel French, the professor, the biology professor
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:44.720]  responded to the tweet with an extended harangue in which she impugned Cain's motives and derided
[02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:47.360]  his understanding of biology.
[02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:51.920]  This is what she tweeted, bear in mind, this is a biology professor.
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:58.800]  This is who's teaching your kids right now, quote, hey, geneticist here, you disingenuously
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:03.760]  and for bigoted purposes oversimplified a complex phenomenon.
[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:07.800]  She went on to tweet a few notes, one sex and gender aren't the same thing.
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:14.480]  Again, that's that incredibly deluded argument that there are untold genders that toddlers
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:16.000]  can be gender fluid.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:23.600]  We had Lewis Hamilton, the Formula One champion, having to apologize for ribbing his nephew
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:25.480]  because he was wearing a princess dress.
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:27.960]  He said, boys, don't wear princess dresses.
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:29.680]  He was castigated.
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:31.240]  He was crucified.
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:33.760]  He was forced to recant for his thought crime.
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:38.640]  And this is what this biology professor is saying, sex and gender aren't the same thing.
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:43.880]  And two, chromosomes don't determine sex.
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:45.880]  She literally tweeted that out.
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:53.880]  This is a biology professor saying that the XX and XY chromosomes don't determine sex.
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:25:01.880]  Most unscientific, incredibly obscure thing you could ever say as a scientist.
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:07.160]  Chromosomes don't determine sex, but these are the people who stand with science.
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:13.760]  Where unscientific ill-informed bigots for questioning global warming, they're scientific
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:16.160]  and they say chromosomes don't determine sex.
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:19.800]  These are the people who are teaching your kids.
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:20.800]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:25.360]  Oh, by the way, Elizabeth Warren tweeted that she was all about the science.
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:29.080]  This is the woman who claims, of course, Native American ancestry.
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:33.520]  There's no evidence for that whatsoever, but she's all about the science too.
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:35.960]  Absolutely insane.
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:41.480]  Idiot protest Trump by yelling at his robot doll during Disney World Show.
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:45.240]  This is one of my favorite headlines of the week by far.
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:49.040]  Trump derangement syndrome claimed another victim after a former executive assistant
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:54.720]  at NBC decided to protest the president by yelling at his animatronic robot doll during
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:57.080]  a show at Disney World.
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:25:59.000]  Now you've probably seen this robot doll.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:04.440]  They have a big show, all the past presidents reading a statement, all the robots, they
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:09.440]  all look really lifelike, realistic, probably apart from the Trump one, which looks like
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:15.440]  it was a Hillary Clinton doll that they had to reconfigure after she lost the election.
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:17.720]  Some people have claimed that.
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:22.960]  So all these presidents, of course, current and former get up and give this speech, all
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:27.680]  these robots, very lifelike, it's quite a good show, quite an interesting show.
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:36.040]  But Jay Malski decided to assert himself as a member of the resistance by getting up at
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:41.480]  this Disney World Show, bearing in mind he'd be surrounded by parents with their kids,
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:42.480]  frightened kids.
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:44.920]  Who's this screaming idiot, daddy?
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:48.280]  He got up and started screaming, lock him up at a robot.
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:50.280]  He literally did that.
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:54.680]  While other audience members probably concerned about their fright and children told him
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:59.280]  to shut up, one of the audience members informed Malski that he was literally yelling at a
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:03.760]  robot telling him he's not real.
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:10.000]  He tweeted, Malski, the brave resistance member tweeted, I protested real Donald Trump at
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:16.920]  the Hall of Presidents, cuz, cuz, I'll never get this close in real life, probs, hashtag
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:19.640]  lock him up.
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:24.760]  Now the responses to this tweet were monumentally funny, as you can go and see for yourself.
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:28.960]  One person pointed out Disney World is a private park and has a set of guidelines and standards
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:34.120]  to ensure guests have a good experience, that video is disgusting and immature, families
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:39.080]  trying to enjoy their vacations, not listen to your friends' ridiculous shouting.
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:44.760]  While Malski doubled down in response to this by suggesting that his process was legitimate
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:53.000]  because Disney is a public institution because it's a publicly traded company, so this guy
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:57.720]  literally thinks that because Disney is on the stock market, that means it's a public
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:03.480]  institution, yeah, that's the level of intelligence that we're dealing with here.
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:08.760]  In a tweet that was subsequently deleted after he started to get attention for this, Malski
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:14.040]  posted a picture of the Trump robot and remarked, okay, are we allowed to say that we want to
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:15.800]  murder this?
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:23.120]  So he literally tweeted his desire to murder a Trump-like robot before he even did this.
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:29.720]  This is the level of sanity, this is virulent Trump derangement syndrome on display.
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:36.080]  He's come out since and given an interview with a bar left SJW outlet, heckler of Trump
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:41.520]  animatronic at Disney World responds to haters, he said, check your privilege, well check
[02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:46.360]  your intelligence because you're a complete dunderhead and you've been ridiculed beyond
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:47.360]  all expectation.
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:51.640]  This is the Alex Show Show Live, we'll be back in the next segment with more breaking

[02:32:58.120 --> 02:33:20.800]  We are back live on the Alex Jones show getting right back into this news and of course a
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:26.000]  couple of days ago we had CNN literally hiding in bushes to get footage of Donald Trump's
[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:33.520]  golf swing behaving like crazed buddy boiler stalkers stalking their ex-boyfriends.
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:38.680]  Well now we have this headline, CNN's quest for truths behind truck blocking view of Trump
[02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:44.000]  golf course stretches into second day CNN's quest to uncover an explanation.
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.360]  They see them hiding in the bushes trying to get a shot of his golf swing.
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:53.480]  Absolutely incredible but they had a larger objective with this.
[02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:59.080]  They would on a quest to uncover why a truck and if a truck was blocking their view of
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:04.920]  Trump's golf course, well this stretched into a second day on Wednesday and once again
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:09.120]  bore no concrete answers but rest assured CNN's on the case.
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:13.400]  Noah Gray, a producer for CNN who tweeted a picture of a white box truck in front of
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:18.440]  hedges adjacent to the golf course on Wednesday tracked down what looked to be an identical
[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:22.800]  if not the same truck parked Thursday in a parking lot at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's
[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:24.120]  Department.
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:29.680]  When asked about the truck, again this is an important national security issue, the Sheriff's
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:34.560]  Department told CNN it did not order the truck to obstruct the media's view of the President.
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:38.800]  Gray noted a spokesman for the department, Todd Barbera reiterated that denial on Thursday
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:41.440]  saying the management team didn't order the truck.
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:45.360]  So they were on it Wednesday, they were on it Thursday no doubt they're still on it today.
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:50.920]  Was this truck used to block the media, the massive story that CNN's hot in the case of
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:56.160]  Trump. CNN's John Berman who sat in for Anderson Cooper on his 360 evening program on Thursday
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:01.080]  said that the truck which was in a lot behind a fence was parked in such a way that they
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:04.280]  could not compare license plates.
[02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:08.200]  This is completely obsessive crap.
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:11.360]  Berman also said that where the truck was parked on Wednesday outside of Trump's golf
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:16.440]  course, only Sheriff's Department vehicles had parked there previously.
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:21.360]  This is how beset they are with every tiny frigging nuance of Donald Trump's life.
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:23.000]  It's ridiculous.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:27.640]  The truck blocks CNN's view of the golf course one day after the network touted exclusive
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:31.320]  footage of the President hitting the links.
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:36.320]  Remember before he was even inaugurated where Trump, I think as Trump went to dinner with
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:41.360]  his family and the media thought, oh my God, he's gone to dinner with his family.
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:47.280]  That level of obsession hasn't decreased a year later. Let that sink in.
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:52.080]  CNN reached out to the Secret Service, listen to the Secret Service's response.
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:54.080]  This is funny.
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:57.800]  For comment on whether it had anything to do with the truck, the driver of which in
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:01.040]  the video could be seen blocking a view of his or her face.
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:07.280]  The Secret Service responded in a statement, quote, the USS Secret Service is in the business
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:14.040]  of protection and investigations not in commissioning vehicles to block the media's view of the
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:16.040]  President's golf swing.
[02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:21.600]  And I think that underscores the ludicrousness of this obsession.
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:26.920]  Hiding in the bushes, crafting conspiracy theories about Trump using a truck to block
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:27.920]  their view.
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:33.000]  There was another one a couple of days ago, an Associated Press article asking, why does
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:38.680]  Trump only stay at Trump properties, Trump owned properties when he's in D.C.?
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:45.040]  Well, the answer is obvious because your relentless hysteria, your obsession, your relentless
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:52.440]  hysteria about his presidency being illegitimate makes it unsafe for him not to stay in Trump
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:53.940]  owned properties.
[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:58.480]  We don't want a James T. Hodgkinson mark two on our hands, do we?
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:03.840]  You've radicalized a significant portion of these idiotic resistance members, some of
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:07.160]  whom are quite prepared to carry out violence.
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:13.040]  So why do you think Trump's careful about where he stays, where he appears in public?
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:18.320]  When your level of obsession, your level of hysterical obsession comes down to hiding
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:24.840]  in bushes and crafting insane conspiracy theories about trucks and the Secret Service being
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:26.920]  in on it and all that kind of stuff.
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:31.800]  When you've got that level of obsession, when you've tried to delegitimize the very
[02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:37.960]  legitimacy of his presidency, of the election itself, you're going to have crazies out there
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:43.760]  who are willing to take a pop shot and your rhetoric is partly responsible for that, as
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:48.120]  we saw in the case of James T. Hodgkinson when he tried to shoot up a bunch of Congress
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:50.280]  members.
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:55.560]  So why do you think he stays at Trump owned properties in D.C.?
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:00.800]  Not Trump Derangement Syndrome, professor who blamed Trumpism for Las Vegas massacre
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:01.800]  resigned.
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:06.880]  A far left Drexel University professor known for making inflammatory remarks on social
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:12.200]  media is resigning from his teaching job, blaming a right wing internet mob for alleged
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:13.200]  harassment.
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:17.960]  The same blame excuse they come out with every single time.
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:23.320]  You write absolute crap on the internet, you're going to get crap back, it's called being
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:28.480]  a public figure, having an opinion on social media, you're going to get some back.
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:33.800]  Whenever the left does it, whenever they get some heat back, oh, it's harassment, because
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:34.800]  there's no flakes.
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:40.440]  This is the same guy who tweeted that he wished for white genocide over Christmas.
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:47.160]  That was his Christmas wish, a time when people come together, there's this unity of humanity.
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:52.680]  We can drop the politics just for a few days, get together and celebrate the core principles
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:54.640]  of what it is to be a human now.
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:57.520]  We want white genocide.
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:38:58.520]  That's the mindset.
[02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:03.560]  George Sikorello Meyer, an associate professor of politics and global studies at the Philadelphia
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:06.080]  School will be leaving next year.
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:11.320]  They finally got rid of him after all these ridiculous statements on Twitter.
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:16.000]  On Christmas Eve, he said all he wanted for the holidays was a white genocide.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:21.120]  This is the guy who said he wanted to vomit or yell after seeing an airline passenger giving
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:28.240]  up a first-class seat to a US military service member, voluntarily, by the way.
[02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:29.960]  That's a nice gesture, isn't it?
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:35.000]  Giving up your first-class seat to a US military service member, no, it made him want to vomit
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  and yell.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.240]  Oh, but Sheila Jackson Leak and just steal somebody else's seat, and that's perfectly
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:41.240]  fine.
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:44.720]  And they're racist for complaining about it.
[02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:45.720]  This is the new life.
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:49.480]  He's finally been made to, and those comments aren't even the worst of it.
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:52.960]  In fact, you can go and look, you can go on Twitter, I think there's a Twitter account
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:58.080]  called farleftwatch, which tweeted out some of his past statements.
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:39:59.080]  Absolutely insane.
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:01.640]  Anyone else would be banned for them on Twitter.
[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:03.600]  Imagine wishing black genocide.
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:06.240]  You'd be banned in a heartbeat, and rightly so.
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:08.680]  This guy tweeted that a year ago.
[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:09.880]  Nobody touches him.
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:14.680]  He's sacred, but now he's finally been forced to resign from his job.
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:19.960]  He's whining a bitching about harassment because people dared to challenge his dumb-frigging
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:23.080]  opinions on Twitter, boo-hoo.
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:26.040]  See you more on bye-bye.
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:30.920]  The American Mirror reports CNN's Don Lemon, Trump saying Merry Christmas is a dog whistle
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:33.800]  to base.
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:36.920]  President Donald Trump wants Americans to feel free to say Merry Christmas again, but
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:41.680]  CNN's Don Lemon thinks that's a dog whistle to his base.
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:45.120]  CNN had a clip from Trump pointing out that people are saying Merry Christmas again since
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:49.240]  he took office, and he said, quote, this is a line that we've heard from Donald Trump
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:50.240]  many, many times.
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:51.240]  Why does he continue?
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:55.160]  This is a dog whistle to the base because no one has ever stopped saying Merry Christmas.
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:40:58.520]  So the left are coming out again, they're saying, don't be stupid.
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:01.040]  We never stopped saying Merry Christmas.
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:03.920]  The war on Christmas isn't a thing.
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:04.920]  Forget about it.
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:05.920]  Stop obsessing about it.
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:06.920]  What's your problem?
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:12.000]  Oh, by the way, they're also saying, we're triggered by Trump saying Merry Christmas.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.800]  We say it promotes white nationalism and we're implying that it's racist.
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:20.880]  So anybody who complains about Merry Christmas being frowned upon, they're insane.
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:21.880]  They're conspiracy theorists.
[02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:24.680]  Oh, by the way, we're going to frown upon you saying Merry Christmas and say you're
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:25.680]  racist.
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:33.080]  For doing so, Newsweek article claims Trump uses Merry Christmas to promote white nationalism.
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:38.040]  So again, Don Lemon is up there saying there's no war on Christmas.
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:40.760]  Nobody says saying Merry Christmas is a bad thing.
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:45.120]  Meanwhile, the same mainstream media is saying that anyone who uses the term Merry Christmas
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:52.120]  is promoting white nationalism, that Donald Trump is a dog whistle for white nationalism.
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:53.120]  This is out of Newsweek.
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:55.560]  This came out like a week ago.
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:00.080]  How Trump and the Nazis stole Christmas to promote white nationalism, the author and
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:05.320]  several academics linked Trump's repeated Christmas wishes to a desire to exclude other
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:10.120]  religions and foment a culture war.
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:12.800]  So again, there's no war on Christmas.
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:14.560]  Nobody's telling you you can't say Merry Christmas.
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:19.640]  Oh, by the way, if you do say Merry Christmas, you're racist and a white nationalist.
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:26.240]  Absolutely incredible mental gymnastics from the left and Don Lemon had an entire panel
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:28.960]  where they were up there saying, oh, nobody's attacking Christmas.
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:33.600]  Oh, by the way, if you do vehemently say we should all say Merry Christmas, you're a white
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:34.600]  nationalist.
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:38.320]  Oh, you can't have it both ways.
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:39.320]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:40.320]  We'll be back in the next segment.

[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:21.560]  Now I want to talk about this article, which actually was up at the Daily Mail, which is
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:25.920]  a little bit confusing because normally they get most of this stuff right.
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:33.240]  This is by David Mark Tosco, who breathlessly tweeted, exclusive, a White House intern flashed
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:38.920]  the white power sign while posing with Trump and the rest of his intern class last month.
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:44.560]  So he thought he had a big exclusive on this dark, shady expression of white supremacy
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:46.920]  amidst Trump's inner circle.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:50.880]  I think they changed the headline later on the Daily Mail to try and water it down because
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:52.840]  they realized they put their foot in it.
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:58.160]  The headline of the Daily Mail is exclusive, white power at the White House, Trump intern
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:04.680]  flashes alt-right symbol used by notorious extremists during group photo with the president.
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:09.040]  A former White House intern is coming on a fire after flashing an own white power sign
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:11.440]  during a photo with President Donald Trump.
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:17.360]  Jack Brewer, who graduated from Emory University in Atlanta, is clearly bucking orders, personally
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:20.680]  given by the president, to give a thumbs up in the picture that was taken in the White
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:22.160]  House in November.
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:31.080]  So this is his big, big exclusive, a month-old story of a young guy doing the OK hand sign
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:32.080]  during a photo.
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:35.040]  That's your big exclusive, is it?
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:38.800]  Absolutely incredible stupidity beyond the pale.
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:39.800]  Even the ADL.
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:46.160]  I mean, do you Google for God's sake, the ADL came out, what, a year ago, nearly a year
[02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:52.400]  ago and said, the OK hand sign is not a white supremacist hate symbol.
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:56.840]  That was one of the headlines out of the Independent Anti-Defamation League says OK hand sign,
[02:50:56.840 --> 02:50:58.560]  not a white supremacist hate symbol.
[02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:08.840]  So even the ADL, which, you know, its entire foundation is based on creating hysteria over
[02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:12.840]  supposed hate symbols, supposed hateful messages.
[02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:18.720]  Even the ADL, which makes its money off doing that, its very existence is dependent on fanning
[02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:20.960]  the flames of that hysteria.
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:24.160]  Even they said it was not a white supremacist hate symbol.
[02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:27.800]  And they said that nearly a year ago, like, can you use Google.com?
[02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:34.120]  Oh, the big exclusive, somebody did the OK hand sign a month ago, whoop-de-doo.
[02:51:34.120 --> 02:51:36.360]  They've ruined this guy's life.
[02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:40.560]  The top thing that's going to come up when anybody searches this guy, when he's applying
[02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:46.880]  for a job, is that he's a white supremacist, turns out he's Jewish.
[02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:54.760]  Daily Mail did an update story on this, White House intern Jack Brewer, accused of flashing
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:52:01.400]  white nationalist sign by Daily Mail, tells me he was simply emulating POTUS, Donald Trump
[02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:06.840]  who's also done the same OK sign on numerous occasions, and he has Jewish heritage.
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:09.080]  This guy's Jewish.
[02:52:09.080 --> 02:52:14.360]  White Toaks came out with a tweet in response to this, addressing the writer of the Daily
[02:52:14.360 --> 02:52:19.040]  Mail article who fell for this stupidity and seemed incapable of doing a basic Google
[02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:20.040]  search.
[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:24.400]  He said, David, the slightest due diligence would have shown you that this is not true.
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:26.240]  It is not a hate symbol.
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:32.200]  You've caused irreparable damage to this intern's reputation and future career prospects, retract
[02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:35.000]  an issue of apology immediately.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:38.440]  Whether they've done that in a time since this came out yesterday, I didn't have a
[02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:40.880]  chance to check, but that's the case.
[02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:45.600]  If damage this guy's reputation, any potential employers are going to look and see, oh, he's
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:46.600]  a white supremacist.
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:48.360]  No, he's not.
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:56.320]  This was a 4chan troll to get you to say that doing that is a white supremacist hand sign,
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:53:01.480]  and you fell for it over and over again, just because a bunch of people on an internet forum
[02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:09.240]  say it's white power doesn't make it so, it's the OK hand sign, and even the ADL acknowledges
[02:53:09.240 --> 02:53:10.360]  that fact.
[02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:14.280]  So you're literally spreading fake news and ruining this guy's life.
[02:53:14.280 --> 02:53:17.480]  And as far as I've seen, there's no retraction yet.
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:22.280]  Remember back a thing is about six, eight months ago, Mike Sernovich and Cassandra Fairbanks
[02:53:22.280 --> 02:53:28.520]  got up in front of the White House press briefing room altar there, the lectern, and did the
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:29.520]  same thing.
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:33.560]  And then the independent came out two days later and said, oh, my God, look at this bombshell
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:35.960]  proof of white supremacy.
[02:53:35.960 --> 02:53:40.320]  These are the same people who are actually attacked by the alt-right on a regular basis.
[02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:45.680]  But no, they collectivize, they lump everybody in, they try to demonize Trump supporters
[02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:51.240]  by saying they're white racist nationalists for doing that, the OK hand sign.
[02:53:51.240 --> 02:53:52.240]  This is fake news.
[02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:56.400]  This was fake news nearly a year ago, but they're still prouting it.
[02:53:56.400 --> 02:53:57.400]  They're still pushing it.
[02:53:57.400 --> 02:53:59.640]  They're ruining this guy's reputation.
[02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:02.440]  They're ruining his future career prospects.
[02:54:02.440 --> 02:54:08.240]  Stop being idiots and falling for every single frigging 4chan troll.
[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:10.400]  It's quite simple.
[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:15.480]  Moving on, MSNBC contributed to urge us Democrats to run on Trump impeachment.
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:19.480]  This was James Peterson, who was asked by Steve Kornacki, his impeachment part, the
[02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:21.960]  message for 2018 for Democrats.
[02:54:21.960 --> 02:54:24.840]  He responded, it absolutely should be.
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:28.440]  So again, the Democrats have no actual policy platform.
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:31.520]  They're running on being the anti-Trump party.
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:37.640]  Even though that specific reason was why they lost in 2016, we should welcome this.
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:39.280]  Any Trump supporters should love this.
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:44.360]  They still have no ideas whatsoever about how to reach the middle and working class with
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:45.360]  actual policies.
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:51.320]  They're absolutely terrified that the Trump tax cut will resonate with people in the working
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:54.920]  and middle class as it already is.
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:54:55.920]  What's their response?
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:55:00.680]  Should we get an actual policy platform that addresses this, maybe cater to these people
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:04.480]  who voted for Trump for that very reason because they've been abandoned economically?
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:05.480]  No.
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:10.200]  We're just going to continue artistically screeching about how evil Donald Trump is, about how
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:11.680]  we should impeach him.
[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:13.000]  They've got nothing.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.160]  They've still got nothing.
[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:17.760]  It's not going to translate into votes.
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:18.760]  It didn't before.
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:20.640]  It's not going to do it again.
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:22.840]  Will they actually get a policy platform this time?
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:26.440]  It remains to be seen.
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:28.400]  Farmers markets are now racist, by the way.
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:30.360]  Another thing you can add to the list.
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:34.720]  Farmers markets are insidious white spaces, normalized white eating habits.
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:40.400]  Those are the kind of people who attend farmers markets.
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:41.400]  They're racist.
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:42.560]  You can't attend them anymore.
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:47.360]  Farmers markets normalize the food consumption habits of white people and contribute to the
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:52.720]  oppression of minorities, according to two professors at San Diego State University.
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:56.920]  Again, these are the people teaching your kids.
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:00.680]  Farmers markets are one such environmental improvement that can lead to gentrification.
[02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:05.920]  Bosco and Joss are, argue, saying farmers markets are exclusionary since locals may
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:10.480]  not be able to afford the food and all feel excluded from these new spaces.
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:14.840]  So the author of this article, Chris Menahan, points out, when white people move out of
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:20.560]  a city, it's white flight, when they move in, it's gentrification, and when they move
[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:22.960]  to another country, it's colonization.
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:31.440]  So basically, any behavior while white is racist, this social exclusion is reinforced
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:35.480]  by the whiteness of farmers, the professors argued.
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:39.960]  Whiteness of farmers markets and the white habitus that they can reinforce, the professors
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:43.560]  say, describing farmers markets as white spaces where the food consumption habits of white
[02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:45.680]  people are normalized.
[02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:50.960]  God forbid, would you have something that caters to a certain segment of the population?
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:55.560]  As you would with Mexicans or black people, now it's okay for them, but white people,
[02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:58.920]  it's racist for them simply to turn up at a farmer's market.
[02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:06.880]  So white people casually eating food is now racist, another one to add to the list.
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:11.560]  Fitness coaches guilty of perpetuating fat oppression, professors warn, I can't figure
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:13.560]  out which is the funniest here.
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:17.720]  We've got a biology professor saying the X chromosome, the XY chromosome don't deserve
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:18.720]  insects.
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:22.240]  We've got professors saying that farmers markets are racist.
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:28.160]  We've got other professors saying that fitness coaches, people in gyms who try to help people
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:33.080]  lose weight are now perpetuating fat oppression.
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:36.840]  Once again, these idiots are teaching your kids.
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:41.800]  I'm just going to wrap it up for the show, Owen Troyer is coming up, Ballroom Live, don't
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:44.120]  go away.
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:50.600]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States, powerful 50 billion live organism,
[02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:58.320]  probiotic, floral life that is so critical to having a healthy gut and a healthy life
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:01.720]  and that has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:07.000]  The other part is a compound like Mycos EX that has all these key ingredients of organic
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:11.520]  herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:15.640]  That's why as we go through Christmas and now into the new year, we're extending the
[02:58:15.640 --> 02:58:21.200]  free shipping and 50% off on all our best selling items while supplies last.

[02:58:49.480 --> 02:58:54.840]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.

[02:59:09.320 --> 02:59:14.560]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:18.760]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the

[02:59:42.240 --> 02:59:48.040]  are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:59:48.040 --> 03:00:05.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:05.920 --> 03:00:21.800]  Welcome everyone to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:25.080]  This is normally is called Overdrive and I'm your host Rob Do.
[03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:28.560]  Thanks to Paul Joseph Watson and Owen Schreuer for sitting in.
[03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:31.440]  I'll let you know that Owen will be in about an hour.
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:36.320]  We're going live at Infowars.com forward slash show for the war room.
[03:00:36.320 --> 03:00:39.320]  But for the meantime, I will be here for the most of this hour.
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:44.880]  I'm going to be conducting an interview with two individuals known as Pamphlet Anon and
[03:00:44.880 --> 03:00:47.480]  Baruch the scribe.
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:52.520]  And these two individuals reached out to me, they're moderators on 4chan and 8chan and
[03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:58.600]  Reddit and they mainly deal with cultivating the news that QAnon has been putting out.
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:02.720]  If you're not aware who QAnon is, we're going to go over that.
[03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:08.000]  I really wasn't aware until I found these two Jerome Corsi stories back in December.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:11.440]  I'd kind of heard about QAnon, but I wasn't really paying much attention to it.
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:16.160]  I don't really get on a lot of 4chan boards or anything like that.
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:21.400]  But here's an article from December 22nd QAnon links resignation of Google Schmidt to Trump's
[03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:23.240]  executive order.
[03:01:23.240 --> 03:01:27.240]  And the executive order they're specifically talking about is the executive order blocking
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:32.720]  the property of persons involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption.
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:37.560]  And that is what he actually signed it on December 20th and December 21st.
[03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:42.160]  It went in and then immediately Eric Schmidt resigns.
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:43.400]  So it was a very short post.
[03:01:43.400 --> 03:01:44.400]  It's in the article.
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:45.560]  You could read it.
[03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:49.480]  The executive order allows the Treasury Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of State
[03:01:49.480 --> 03:01:54.480]  to confiscate U.S. assets of anyone materially assisting, sponsoring or providing financial
[03:01:54.480 --> 03:02:00.920]  material or technological support to those engaged in human rights abuses and or corruption.
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:04.800]  So I covered that a few days ago on the war room.
[03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:10.760]  And people are speculating now that it has to do with Schmidt's womenizing.
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:17.800]  And who knows how many flights he took on the Pito Express or if he did go on it.
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:21.840]  And then a few days later, five days later, of course, he put out this article QAnon exposes
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:27.040]  dim conspiracy to frame Trump claims Google Schmidt played pivotal role, which would make
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:33.480]  a lot of sense because Hillary has said many, many times when she went in when she arrived
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:36.680]  at the DNC to run for president, everything was in shambles.
[03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:42.600]  And then Eric Schmidt came in and helped organize her voter databases, her online strategy,
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:47.080]  how she was going to win billions and billions of dollars behind this failed candidate.
[03:02:47.080 --> 03:02:51.200]  And she couldn't beat one man with his Twitter and his private jet.
[03:02:51.200 --> 03:02:55.040]  So what it shows you is the awakening that's happening.
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:58.480]  And so these two individuals that are going to come on, they're a part of anonymous is
[03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:02.920]  really about, it's just another manifestation of the global awakening that really took
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:04.000]  place this year.
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  It's going to turbo charge next year, where we're already seeing the fall of mainstream
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:11.880]  media happening happening in real time every day.
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:16.920]  Something happens where we just take a brick from their facade.
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:19.000]  But let's go into this article.
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:24.160]  According to the cryptic narrative, Schmidt played a major role in Hillary Clinton's 2016
[03:03:24.160 --> 03:03:25.160]  presidential campaign.
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:30.080]  And in the subsequent conspiracy to promote the crowd strike analysis of the DNC email
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:33.440]  heist and the fusion GPS dossier.
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:37.840]  So that may be one reason why Schmidt is getting out.
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:40.840]  And because he knows that his time has come.
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:47.320]  Also shockingly, QAnon directly suggests that the heist of the DNC emails, including emails
[03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:51.760]  from the Hillary campaign chair, John Podesta, weren't inside job by Seth Rich, an IT employee
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:55.240]  of the DNC who became disillusioned with Hillary.
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:57.480]  Rich realized they were colluding and it's Bernie Sanders.
[03:03:57.480 --> 03:03:58.480]  We've talked about that.
[03:03:58.480 --> 03:03:59.480]  This is information.
[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:01.600]  I think most of our audience already knows.
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:06.720]  So shockingly QAnon also claims Debbie Wasserman Schultz put out a contract to MS13 gang members
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:09.080]  to murder Seth Rich.
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:12.960]  That would be bombshell if we were able to get bona fide evidence of that.
[03:04:12.960 --> 03:04:16.920]  At this point, it's just a claim on an anonymous board.
[03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:20.960]  So we're going to talk to these two guests coming up at least for the next three segments.
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:26.240]  And then also, if I have time, I'm going to get into the lawsuit Judge Roy Moore filed
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:29.480]  because it shows bona fide election fraud.
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:31.400]  You're not going to want to miss this.
[03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:32.400]  Tell everybody right now.
[03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:34.880]  Go to infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:36.760]  We're going to start breaking open some bombshells.
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:53.160]  Thanks for watching.
[03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:57.800]  Feel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[03:04:57.800 --> 03:05:01.760]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[03:05:01.760 --> 03:05:05.080]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:05:05.080 --> 03:05:09.360]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:11.200]  particles in the gut.
[03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:13.640]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:17.760]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:05:17.760 --> 03:05:20.760]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[03:05:20.760 --> 03:05:25.320]  You can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[03:05:25.320 --> 03:05:28.120]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[03:05:28.120 --> 03:05:32.320]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:36.320]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:05:36.320 --> 03:05:40.640]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so
[03:05:40.640 --> 03:05:43.360]  you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:44.720]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[03:05:44.720 --> 03:05:47.400]  Use carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[03:05:47.400 --> 03:06:14.920]  Listen to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now, that's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:06:14.920 --> 03:06:25.720]  Clashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:25.720 --> 03:06:28.320]  So just a quick show note to the crew in there.
[03:06:28.320 --> 03:06:31.440]  I didn't have much time to talk to them before I came on.
[03:06:31.440 --> 03:06:34.520]  From time to time I'm going to be referring to things on my computer and feel free to
[03:06:34.520 --> 03:06:35.520]  go to it.
[03:06:35.520 --> 03:06:39.560]  And I also want to show my menu bar so people can follow along at home because we're going
[03:06:39.560 --> 03:06:44.200]  to be jumping between Reddit and 8chan posts and jumping all over the place.
[03:06:44.200 --> 03:06:49.520]  And if you haven't been into this culture, it can get a little confusing.
[03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:54.080]  My two guests are going to say you should lurk instead of post and ask questions.
[03:06:54.080 --> 03:06:56.960]  Just kind of watch and you'll see how things play out.
[03:06:56.960 --> 03:07:03.600]  But if you go to reddit.com forward slash r forward slash cbts underscore stream, it
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:08.600]  will take you to a sticky post that went up this morning by Pamphlet Anon.
[03:07:08.600 --> 03:07:11.560]  Basically talking about this information.
[03:07:11.560 --> 03:07:15.840]  And if you want to post things on here, this is a good place to post your information that
[03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:16.840]  you have.
[03:07:16.840 --> 03:07:22.320]  What we're trying to do here is to reach out to patriots out there who might not be aware
[03:07:22.320 --> 03:07:28.480]  of this system set up because when I was talking to the two guests earlier today, they said
[03:07:28.480 --> 03:07:32.960]  we wanted to start doing these to get people to come out and bring out more information
[03:07:32.960 --> 03:07:35.760]  to help connect more dots because they're only interested in the truth.
[03:07:35.760 --> 03:07:37.000]  They're not getting paid to do this.
[03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.400]  They're doing this as volunteers.
[03:07:39.400 --> 03:07:43.960]  But there it is at CBTS stands for calm before the storm.
[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:50.280]  There's also a CBTS underscore stream forward slash wiki forward slash FAQ, which also
[03:07:50.280 --> 03:07:56.360]  has basically a primer if you need more information.
[03:07:56.360 --> 03:08:01.480]  And then somewhere in this also there's this Q this Anon file, which is basically everything
[03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:03.120]  Q has done.
[03:08:03.120 --> 03:08:08.360]  And it's about 500 pages on it's a PDF and I'll be referring to that from time to time.
[03:08:08.360 --> 03:08:13.440]  So there you can see the calm before the storm CBTS when you see that that's what it stands
[03:08:13.440 --> 03:08:17.200]  for calm before the storm and I'll go to pamphlet first.
[03:08:17.200 --> 03:08:19.280]  And where do you want to start with this?
[03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:25.360]  Why is Q Anon so important to where we're at today in this global situation?
[03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:29.240]  We find ourselves in with Trump coming in and really taking it to the globalists.
[03:08:29.240 --> 03:08:30.240]  Okay.
[03:08:30.240 --> 03:08:33.680]  Well, first of all, how are you doing, man?
[03:08:33.680 --> 03:08:34.680]  I'm doing great.
[03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:35.680]  Thanks for joining me.
[03:08:35.680 --> 03:08:36.680]  Awesome.
[03:08:36.680 --> 03:08:37.680]  Yeah.
[03:08:37.680 --> 03:08:38.680]  Okay.
[03:08:38.680 --> 03:08:48.680]  Q Anon is important, I think, because one of the early on in his post was that this is
[03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:54.120]  going to be the biggest Intel drop in awful world history.
[03:08:54.120 --> 03:08:56.760]  And I think that's absolutely true.
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:09:01.360]  This is far bigger than it's far bigger than anything that's come before it.
[03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:09.240]  And it encompasses so many different, you know, many different groups of people in power
[03:09:09.240 --> 03:09:13.960]  that it's just mind boggling.
[03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:20.960]  And the things that he's revealed are just, it's shocking to people.
[03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:23.840]  What do you think the biggest bombshells that he's dropped so far?
[03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:27.320]  Matt, what do you think?
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:39.240]  Hey, Rob, great to be on your show, yeah, it's terrifying.
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:45.760]  The fact that the world is run by Satan worshipers, which Alex Jones has been saying for decades.
[03:09:45.760 --> 03:09:50.760]  So I think if you've been listening to info wars, then you'll know this already.
[03:09:50.760 --> 03:09:55.960]  It's just we've had confirmation now from this individual who is obviously one of President
[03:09:55.960 --> 03:09:59.800]  Trump's right hand man.
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:04.960]  And I'll say this, I'll go back to the top of this PDF if you download it.
[03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:06.920]  It's fairly large, but I think it's worth it.
[03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:11.200]  And one thing that's great about this is it takes everything offline.
[03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:12.840]  There's a picture.
[03:10:12.840 --> 03:10:18.000]  One of the first Q posts is a picture of Trump and Stephen Miller, I believe Kushner's in
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:19.960]  here and they're all giving the thumbs up.
[03:10:19.960 --> 03:10:26.680]  And if you follow the thumbs, it makes a Q, which I think is that was his first sign to
[03:10:26.680 --> 03:10:27.680]  come out.
[03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:30.560]  But this is also a picture inside Air Force One.
[03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:36.560]  And I mean, to you guys, what does this prove to you that this guy is deep inside Trump's
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:37.560]  inner circle?
[03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:40.160]  Or is he one step removed?
[03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:43.120]  What do you what do you think?
[03:10:43.120 --> 03:10:50.240]  A picture man, I think it's just more like a funny, you can't really draw any firm conclusions
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:57.520]  from that, but it's definitely interesting, and also another point with that, the file
[03:10:57.520 --> 03:11:06.720]  name of that image, I believe had the words do it, which is just, that's great.
[03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:12.280]  But there are a lot of other things that came up after that picture that really do prove
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:14.360]  him to be what he says he is.
[03:11:14.360 --> 03:11:15.360]  Right.
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:17.160]  Now, his first post was on October 28th.
[03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:20.920]  So he hasn't been posting for that long, barely.
[03:11:20.920 --> 03:11:25.160]  I guess today would be three months or yeah, actually yesterday was two months.
[03:11:25.160 --> 03:11:26.160]  I'm sorry.
[03:11:26.160 --> 03:11:27.160]  Two months.
[03:11:27.160 --> 03:11:28.160]  That's right.
[03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:33.160]  His first post was talking about Operation Mockingbird and Hillary Clinton is going
[03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:35.720]  to be detained, not arrested.
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:40.760]  And then we've seen Hillary Clinton wearing a boot, which some people claim she's hiding
[03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:44.560]  an ankle bracelet, one of those ankle braces that don't allow you to leave the, you know,
[03:11:44.560 --> 03:11:47.200]  your general area, your country or whatever.
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:48.680]  Where do you think that lies?
[03:11:48.680 --> 03:11:51.240]  And I know that that's kind of speculation at this point, but then we'll get into some
[03:11:51.240 --> 03:11:54.880]  of the hardcore things that we can prove.
[03:11:54.880 --> 03:12:00.120]  If you want to take it.
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:08.800]  Yeah, Rob, so the way Q has been leading has been really interesting.
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:15.920]  What he's done is most of the time he's been asking questions that basically answer themselves.
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:24.360]  So if, you know, if you've got that PDF in front of you or the map, he, you know, he'll
[03:12:24.360 --> 03:12:27.720]  fire up a whole lot of questions.
[03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:29.640]  Was the election supposed to be rigged?
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:31.520]  Did good people prevent the rigging?
[03:12:31.520 --> 03:12:33.560]  Why did protest former panel to investigate?
[03:12:33.560 --> 03:12:38.840]  I'm just reading Q's 12th post here up on the, up on the web.
[03:12:38.840 --> 03:12:43.240]  Why is voter surrounded by highly respected generals, who guards former presidents?
[03:12:43.240 --> 03:12:49.560]  So what he's doing is he's giving us background information directly because of course, you
[03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:52.920]  know, each, the next question answers the previous question.
[03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:57.400]  So he's giving us information, which is very difficult to pick up via a semantic analysis
[03:12:57.400 --> 03:13:03.360]  through surveillance software is pretty bad at that at the moment.
[03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:08.840]  But what he's also doing is asking us, is giving us riddles that we need to solve so
[03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:13.600]  that we can then dig deeper and find out what is the truth behind what he's making.
[03:13:13.600 --> 03:13:14.600]  Right.
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:18.520]  And in this first post at the very bottom, so he's got Mockingbird at the top, then he
[03:13:18.520 --> 03:13:23.120]  has Mockingbird 103017, which would have been two days later after he made this post.
[03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:25.720]  He also started talking about Soros's money.
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:28.560]  Why did Soros donate all of his money recently?
[03:13:28.560 --> 03:13:31.520]  Why would he replace all of his funds in a RC?
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:35.240]  What does, what does RC stand for?
[03:13:35.240 --> 03:13:39.440]  I'm sorry, which poster you're looking at?
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:43.000]  I'm looking at his first post October 28th, the very first one.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:44.000]  Yeah.
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  Right.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  The very first one.
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  What?
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:48.000]  Where is HRC?
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:51.480]  Is that what you're asking me?
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:52.640]  No, no, no, RC.
[03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:54.200]  He just says RC.
[03:13:54.200 --> 03:14:00.240]  Why, why would he place all his funds in a RC and then it's at the very bottom?
[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:02.360]  Registered charity.
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:03.360]  Okay.
[03:14:03.360 --> 03:14:10.440]  George, George Soros transferred his personal funds into his Open Society Foundation.
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:11.440]  Right.
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:15.880]  Obviously a bit of a panic move to try and protect it, but yeah, I don't think it's going
[03:14:15.880 --> 03:14:16.880]  to work.
[03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:22.040]  And so you think he might use this executive order to go after George Soros as well?
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:24.280]  I think he already has.
[03:14:24.280 --> 03:14:25.280]  Okay.
[03:14:25.280 --> 03:14:31.240]  Now, you were telling me earlier that there was a post that it took you a month to figure
[03:14:31.240 --> 03:14:34.880]  out what he was saying and what page number is that post on and we'll go to it and we'll
[03:14:34.880 --> 03:14:36.520]  show it to everybody.
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:38.520]  Oh, wow.
[03:14:38.520 --> 03:14:42.400]  That, okay, that, that is a little bit tricky.
[03:14:42.400 --> 03:14:46.200]  I'll tell you what, Rob, I'll tell you what the most spectacular example for me is.
[03:14:46.200 --> 03:14:47.200]  Okay.
[03:14:47.200 --> 03:14:49.800]  Is the Lord's Prayer.
[03:14:49.800 --> 03:15:01.880]  Q on November the 15th, you know, dropped some information for us in his usual style.
[03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:07.160]  So he begins by, as usual, asking a whole lot of questions, who financed 9-11, who has
[03:15:07.160 --> 03:15:11.840]  been laden's handler, why were the clowns in America tasked to capture, hand capture
[03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:13.760]  kills, if some have been laden?
[03:15:13.760 --> 03:15:14.760]  Right.
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:15.760]  Why not military intelligence?
[03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:23.840]  Well, yeah, I saw this question and then our father, who walks in heaven, hello be
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:27.200]  thy name, thy kingdom come, he writes out the Lord's Prayer.
[03:15:27.200 --> 03:15:31.920]  And yeah, I don't think we really even noticed that and that, okay, so that's now November
[03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:32.920]  the 15th.
[03:15:32.920 --> 03:15:33.920]  All right.
[03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:35.400]  Hey, we're about, we're about to go to break.
[03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:37.120]  I'll let you finish that up on the other side.
[03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:39.480]  You're watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.

[03:03:38.980 --> 03:20:39.840]  the free stream you need to send out to everybody.
[03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:44.800]  We are talking with two moderators on 4chan and 8chan and Reddit who basically have been
[03:20:44.800 --> 03:20:52.160]  cultivating and curating the QAnon posts, and we were focusing on a post from Tuesday,
[03:20:52.160 --> 03:20:57.680]  the 14th of November, and it is, if you're reading along at home, you can find it on
[03:20:57.680 --> 03:21:03.320]  page 175 in your textbook of QAnon posts.
[03:21:03.320 --> 03:21:07.680]  It starts off with who financed 9-11, who was Bin Laden's handler?
[03:21:07.680 --> 03:21:13.720]  Why was the clowns in America, that's CIA, tasked to hunt, capture, kill Osama Bin Laden?
[03:21:13.720 --> 03:21:15.560]  Why not military intelligence?
[03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:19.800]  If we found Osama Bin Laden, eliminated security, why would we not kill him and not take him
[03:21:19.800 --> 03:21:20.800]  alive?
[03:21:20.800 --> 03:21:25.080]  Why wouldn't we want to capture him and extract more information?
[03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:31.160]  And he also says it leads to an end game talking point, I guess you could say.
[03:21:31.160 --> 03:21:36.360]  Perhaps someday, we will understand, people will understand, they had a plan to conduct
[03:21:36.360 --> 03:21:42.240]  another mass extinction event, World War I, World War II, orchestrated by planned select
[03:21:42.240 --> 03:21:43.240]  families.
[03:21:43.240 --> 03:21:44.240]  That's the stuff we know.
[03:21:44.240 --> 03:21:48.640]  But then he goes in to the Lord's Prayer, and Baruch, why don't you break that down?
[03:21:48.640 --> 03:21:51.520]  Why do you think it's important, we were, as we were going to break you, we're kind
[03:21:51.520 --> 03:21:52.520]  of getting into that.
[03:21:52.520 --> 03:21:56.440]  Why was it so important that he go into the Lord's Prayer at the end of this?
[03:21:56.440 --> 03:22:00.000]  Yeah, Rob, so, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:05.080]  So, some good questions from Q to make us think, go do research, and then he talks
[03:22:05.080 --> 03:22:08.440]  about the Lord's Prayer, and yeah, I didn't get it.
[03:22:08.440 --> 03:22:12.440]  I thought that was, I thought, okay, Q is a Christian, maybe the Catholic.
[03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:17.720]  I mean, he has, he has, you know, he has thumbs up, another post to, you know, a Catholic
[03:22:17.720 --> 03:22:18.720]  prayer.
[03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:23.160]  So, I thought, oh, that's cool, great, you know, he's a Christian, that's brilliant.
[03:22:23.160 --> 03:22:30.000]  And then on November the 7th, I think it was, so, sorry, I think it was December the 7th,
[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:31.000]  so holiday.
[03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:38.280]  So, a few weeks later, the Pope announces that he wants to change the Lord's Prayer.
[03:22:38.280 --> 03:22:44.800]  And yeah, so now a couple of people noticed that, I missed it, but then Q popped on two
[03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:49.200]  days later and said, future proves pop.
[03:22:49.200 --> 03:22:51.520]  Why was the Lord's Prayer posted?
[03:22:51.520 --> 03:22:52.520]  Which version?
[03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:53.520]  Why is this relevant?
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:23:01.040]  And I was absolutely thought, basically Q knew somehow the Pope was going to change
[03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:02.040]  the Lord's Prayer.
[03:23:02.040 --> 03:23:07.680]  So, here's a person, here's an individual who has somehow inside knowledge of the most
[03:23:07.680 --> 03:23:12.800]  secret inner working of one of the most closely guarded places in the world, which is the
[03:23:12.800 --> 03:23:13.800]  Vatican.
[03:23:13.800 --> 03:23:15.920]  That was very, very impressive.
[03:23:15.920 --> 03:23:16.920]  That was amazing.
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:20.360]  That was the most spectacular proof I've ever seen.
[03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:23.040]  And you notice he didn't give it away up front.
[03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:26.520]  He didn't say, oh, the Lord's Prayer is going to be posted, guys, keep your eyes open.
[03:23:26.520 --> 03:23:30.520]  No, because that would just alert, you know, whoever's watching, the bad guys, because
[03:23:30.520 --> 03:23:33.920]  the bad people do watch these forums as well.
[03:23:33.920 --> 03:23:39.960]  So, Q gave us this perfect method of proof, which he could then go back and say, see,
[03:23:39.960 --> 03:23:46.080]  hold yourself, that, yeah, the staggering, that Q knows the Pope's mind.
[03:23:46.080 --> 03:23:47.080]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:23:47.080 --> 03:23:50.440]  And he has made some predictions on that FAQ.
[03:23:50.440 --> 03:23:54.080]  He predicted President Trump's Twitter being shut down, I think a couple days before.
[03:23:54.080 --> 03:23:56.520]  He predicted the upheaval in Saudi Arabia.
[03:23:56.520 --> 03:24:01.000]  He predicted an incident with a helicopter at a Rothschild estate in the UK days before
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:02.080]  it happened.
[03:24:02.080 --> 03:24:06.720]  He predicted a terrorist attack by Bangladeshi National involving fireworks the day before
[03:24:06.720 --> 03:24:07.720]  it happened.
[03:24:07.720 --> 03:24:10.120]  I mean, this is incredible stuff.
[03:24:10.120 --> 03:24:15.400]  He would have to be getting this, you know, distilling info from the NSA, presidential
[03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:16.400]  briefings.
[03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:20.240]  I mean, where would you, how would one find information like this?
[03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:25.240]  You would have, you would have to be getting almost like tuned into the consciousness of
[03:24:25.240 --> 03:24:27.240]  the world, it seems like.
[03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:30.200]  Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.
[03:24:30.200 --> 03:24:36.080]  This is a man or a team who is standing right next to the president and who knows exactly
[03:24:36.080 --> 03:24:38.480]  what the president is doing at all times.
[03:24:38.480 --> 03:24:41.440]  You can't just suck this out yet, Sam.
[03:24:41.440 --> 03:24:45.200]  This is hardcore prediction of the future.
[03:24:45.200 --> 03:24:46.600]  And that's very important.
[03:24:46.600 --> 03:24:50.960]  I mean, like you were saying right at the beginning of the show, these are anonymous
[03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:57.760]  posts on 4chan and 8chan, which are famous for being anonymous hotbeds of discussion
[03:24:57.760 --> 03:24:58.920]  and all kinds of stuff.
[03:24:58.920 --> 03:25:03.440]  So when somebody says, oh, yeah, I belong to the intelligence services and this is good
[03:25:03.440 --> 03:25:06.720]  information, of course, nobody's going to believe it.
[03:25:06.720 --> 03:25:10.240]  But when they start predicting the future, that's a different story.
[03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:12.640]  That's when you start taking them really seriously.
[03:25:12.640 --> 03:25:13.640]  Yeah.
[03:25:13.640 --> 03:25:17.760]  And I think that's why it took a couple months for him to rack up some of these predictions
[03:25:17.760 --> 03:25:19.640]  and then people started really taking notice.
[03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:22.240]  Jerome, of course, he's been taking notice as well.
[03:25:22.240 --> 03:25:23.240]  He's been writing articles.
[03:25:23.240 --> 03:25:27.480]  I'm sure he'll be writing one about this interview today.
[03:25:27.480 --> 03:25:29.480]  Here's a post from Monday, November 20th.
[03:25:29.480 --> 03:25:34.040]  It's a really long post, but talking about what is a key, what is a key used for using
[03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:35.040]  these question things.
[03:25:35.040 --> 03:25:37.280]  But then he goes into the MSM.
[03:25:37.280 --> 03:25:40.080]  But he also makes a little nod to the alternative media.
[03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:44.840]  Why are non-MSM platforms cast as conspiracy and or non-credible?
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:49.240]  This is page 178 if you're reading along in your book at home.
[03:25:49.240 --> 03:25:53.840]  What power of influence was recently discovered re 2016 election?
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:54.960]  That's the people.
[03:25:54.960 --> 03:25:56.840]  That's the people power of what he's saying.
[03:25:56.840 --> 03:26:01.920]  How much power influence does Twitter, Facebook, Reddit have in influencing the minds of people?
[03:26:01.920 --> 03:26:04.280]  Has the stranglehold of MSM been diminished?
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:05.520]  What is open source?
[03:26:05.520 --> 03:26:10.960]  It moves on continuing on the next page.
[03:26:10.960 --> 03:26:12.400]  Let's see who guards the narrative.
[03:26:12.400 --> 03:26:15.920]  Does the MSM shelter and protect select party members?
[03:26:15.920 --> 03:26:18.520]  I.e. Hillary Clinton.
[03:26:18.520 --> 03:26:22.480]  What prevents a news organization from simply making up sources and stories?
[03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:23.480]  Absolutely nothing.
[03:26:23.480 --> 03:26:25.240]  And we've seen it all over the place.
[03:26:25.240 --> 03:26:28.840]  What if Hugh Hefner was a CIA?
[03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:30.040]  What is a honeypot?
[03:26:30.040 --> 03:26:36.440]  So baby Hugh Hefner, I guess he's alluding to he was a guy who was procuring women for
[03:26:36.440 --> 03:26:38.440]  these different Hollywood elites.
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:43.760]  Notice how once Hugh Hefner died, every the me too movement just exploded.
[03:26:43.760 --> 03:26:48.440]  So it was like he was the spirit of Hugh Hefner or Hugh Hefner himself was keeping a handle
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:49.440]  on that.
[03:26:49.440 --> 03:26:53.480]  What do you think of all this that I've just brought out?
[03:26:53.480 --> 03:26:57.800]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:01.000]  That revelation about Hugh Hefner was breathtaking.
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:06.000]  So basically the plan was, Hugh has always worked on the CIA apparently, according to
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:17.800]  Hugh and I believe him, basically, you know, somebody, a celebrity, a congressman, a senator
[03:27:17.800 --> 03:27:24.720]  that's invited to a Hugh Hefner party, obviously there's a lot of girls, and they're provided
[03:27:24.720 --> 03:27:27.080]  with a private space.
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:34.560]  And guess what, it's all on the hidden cameras, and the girl was underage, although she didn't
[03:27:34.560 --> 03:27:35.560]  look it.
[03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:40.080]  You have now got that person for life because of blackmail.
[03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:43.320]  And that's how it works, blackmail.
[03:27:43.320 --> 03:27:51.920]  I believe the CIA needs only a budget of $10,000 to $20,000 per country to entirely undermine
[03:27:51.920 --> 03:27:56.320]  the elected representatives of the people through sexual blackmail.
[03:27:56.320 --> 03:28:02.080]  It's a very powerful method, and it's how this whole web has spread across the world
[03:28:02.080 --> 03:28:04.720]  and spread across Washington, DC.
[03:28:04.720 --> 03:28:07.760]  And we're now undoing it, thankfully.
[03:28:07.760 --> 03:28:09.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:28:09.320 --> 03:28:14.400]  And you know, we saw, there was speculation why we went into Panama to go after Noriega
[03:28:14.400 --> 03:28:20.360]  was that, and this comes out in John Perkins' book, Confessions of an Economic Hitman,
[03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:25.600]  that he had an island off the coast of Panama, Considora Island, and he had pictures of
[03:28:25.600 --> 03:28:30.040]  George W. Bush getting it on with people and doing drugs, and then that's why we bomb
[03:28:30.040 --> 03:28:33.880]  certain buildings because they held those photographs because we weren't in the digital
[03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:34.880]  age yet.
[03:28:34.880 --> 03:28:35.880]  It was all analog.
[03:28:35.880 --> 03:28:40.120]  We'll be right back with the rest of our interview from Barik Describe and Pamphlet
[03:28:40.120 --> 03:28:41.120]  Anon.
[03:28:41.120 --> 03:28:44.400]  You're watching info.org.com forward slash show, the fourth hour of overdrive of the
[03:28:44.400 --> 03:28:45.400]  Alex Jones show.
[03:28:45.400 --> 03:28:46.400]  Stay tuned.
[03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:47.400]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.
[03:28:47.400 --> 03:28:59.400]  The NSA has noticed how much time you spend on conservative news sites.
[03:28:59.400 --> 03:29:03.360]  We have no choice but to consider you a domestic terrorist.
[03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:24.480]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:25.480]  That's true.
[03:29:25.480 --> 03:29:29.240]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still
[03:29:29.240 --> 03:29:30.480]  alive?

[03:29:50.600 --> 03:30:01.800]  2017 has been a earth-shaking year, and 2018 guaranteed is even going to be wilder.
[03:30:01.800 --> 03:30:06.120]  In fact, my good friend Stephon Malanou said it's going to be like the battle of the gods,
[03:30:06.120 --> 03:30:07.120]  Ragnarok.
[03:30:07.120 --> 03:30:11.800]  So, get ready, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why, thanking you for all your support, we

[03:31:31.840 --> 03:31:33.120]  health benefits.

[03:31:56.280 --> 03:31:58.480]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[03:31:58.480 --> 03:32:02.280]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[03:32:02.280 --> 03:32:09.080]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:32:09.080 --> 03:32:15.440]  And as a longtime infowarslister, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, anthroplex.
[03:32:15.440 --> 03:32:17.840]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the anthroplex, too.

[03:32:31.720 --> 03:32:34.640]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:32:34.640 --> 03:32:35.640]  Absolutely.
[03:32:35.640 --> 03:32:40.760]  And because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[03:32:40.760 --> 03:32:45.080]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in
[03:32:45.080 --> 03:32:56.840]  order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:32:56.840 --> 03:33:22.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:22.840 --> 03:33:31.520]  Rob Dew here with the fourth hour of Overdrive of the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:31.520 --> 03:33:33.160]  It is my pleasure to be with you.
[03:33:33.160 --> 03:33:39.960]  If you ever need to get ahold of me, you can always hit me up on my Twitter, at D-E-W-S-N-E-W-Z,
[03:33:39.960 --> 03:33:42.080]  Dew's News on Twitter.
[03:33:42.080 --> 03:33:49.160]  Yesterday, I was hosting the War Room, and we put out a video about the Roy Moore lawsuit
[03:33:49.160 --> 03:33:55.480]  because as quickly as it came out, the Secretary of State finalized the election and said it
[03:33:55.480 --> 03:33:58.560]  was going to be certified, and we're not even going to look at this allegations of voter
[03:33:58.560 --> 03:33:59.560]  fraud.
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:01.560]  Well, I would encourage everybody to go to this.
[03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:04.720]  Roy Moore lawsuit proves election fraud in Alabama Senate race.
[03:34:04.720 --> 03:34:10.040]  You need to learn, so whether or not this election gets overturned is irrelevant.
[03:34:10.040 --> 03:34:13.600]  What we need to learn is the bag of tricks, which is what QAnon is teaching us.
[03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:16.520]  He's teaching us about the bag of tricks.
[03:34:16.520 --> 03:34:19.600]  So the big thing on here, and I'm going to go over this just for a second, and then we'll
[03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:25.920]  get back to our guests, is this graph.
[03:34:25.920 --> 03:34:30.240]  And in Jefferson County, if you can zoom in on this graph here, there are 20 precincts
[03:34:30.240 --> 03:34:35.800]  in Jefferson County where people that voted straight Republican ticket, Roy Moore got
[03:34:35.800 --> 03:34:41.520]  34% less votes than those who voted straight Republican ticket, which is a statistical
[03:34:41.520 --> 03:34:42.520]  impossibility.
[03:34:42.520 --> 03:34:51.200]  In fact, he says it's one in 15 billion, the guy who did this, this was, what's his name?
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:52.200]  By Phil Evans.
[03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:56.440]  Phil Evans was the researcher, computer programmer who's looked at election fraud.
[03:34:56.440 --> 03:35:02.640]  So there were 20 of these precincts, and the total votes that he got less were 13,000
[03:35:02.640 --> 03:35:04.280]  votes that went to Doug Jones.
[03:35:04.280 --> 03:35:10.040]  So if he got 13,000 less votes, that's a 26,000 vote difference, because if you take
[03:35:10.040 --> 03:35:13.440]  those from Doug Jones and give them to Roy Moore, it's a 26,000 turnaround, which would
[03:35:13.440 --> 03:35:15.760]  have made him the winner of the election.
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:19.320]  So they don't have to take every state, they don't have to touch every voting machine.
[03:35:19.320 --> 03:35:20.960]  It's only certain machines.
[03:35:20.960 --> 03:35:25.720]  There were also allegations in the lawsuit that talk about how there were, they found
[03:35:25.720 --> 03:35:30.400]  bundles of pre-filled out ballots that had Doug Jones already filled out in them.
[03:35:30.400 --> 03:35:32.520]  Of course, they destroyed them all.
[03:35:32.520 --> 03:35:34.960]  We could believe that, but it's an 80-page piece.
[03:35:34.960 --> 03:35:36.920]  I went over it pretty thoroughly.
[03:35:36.920 --> 03:35:40.840]  You should check out that video, Roy Moore lawsuit proves election fraud in Alabama Senate
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:41.840]  race.
[03:35:41.840 --> 03:35:44.320]  Now let's get back to our guests.
[03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:50.760]  I want to go over, actually, I want to ask you guys this question, and you can both answer
[03:35:50.760 --> 03:35:51.760]  this.
[03:35:51.760 --> 03:35:52.760]  You reached out to us.
[03:35:52.760 --> 03:35:57.520]  You wanted to come on to talk about this, and from what you were telling me, the purpose
[03:35:57.520 --> 03:36:03.840]  is to wake other people up that this forum exists, and for others to, I would say, the
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:04.840]  older generation.
[03:36:04.840 --> 03:36:09.160]  I'd like to say the older generation isn't as internet savvy, especially on these different
[03:36:09.160 --> 03:36:15.160]  board services, but they have a lot of human interaction, human networks going along.
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:18.480]  And so we need these people to start getting involved to help fill in the dots.
[03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:21.520]  But why don't you guys say it in your own words, each take a minute, talking about why
[03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:25.480]  you want more people to get involved in this quest for truth.
[03:36:25.480 --> 03:36:28.200]  Yeah, thank you, Rob.
[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:33.720]  So the power of the chant, you know, like four-chant, eight-chant, we've got all these
[03:36:33.720 --> 03:36:38.560]  young men, basically, who are, like, obsessed with winning, obsessed with finding out the
[03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:42.800]  truth, obsessed with investigations, and they've done amazing things for us.
[03:36:42.800 --> 03:36:50.560]  They've found out so many, so much helpful information and a new snippet that confirm
[03:36:50.560 --> 03:36:58.120]  what QAnon has been planning, but the story behind QAnon is so big that we need to get
[03:36:58.120 --> 03:37:03.040]  it out to as many people as possible, which is why we're going wider.
[03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:08.320]  We're talking to YouTubers, we're talking to InfoWars, we're talking to all the independent
[03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:09.320]  media.
[03:37:09.320 --> 03:37:10.320]  We're not talking to mainstream media.
[03:37:10.320 --> 03:37:11.320]  We don't care about them.
[03:37:11.320 --> 03:37:12.520]  We're talking to the people.
[03:37:12.520 --> 03:37:17.960]  We're available to answer your questions directly on the subreddit.
[03:37:17.960 --> 03:37:23.240]  Maybe let me just pass over the pamphlet here, who can tell us why we did what we did.
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:24.240]  Yeah, sure.
[03:37:24.240 --> 03:37:25.760]  How am I coming through, guys?
[03:37:25.760 --> 03:37:26.760]  Oh, you sound great.
[03:37:26.760 --> 03:37:27.760]  You're good now.
[03:37:27.760 --> 03:37:28.760]  You sound great.
[03:37:28.760 --> 03:37:29.760]  Awesome.
[03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:30.760]  Million bucks.
[03:37:30.760 --> 03:37:31.760]  Very nice.
[03:37:31.760 --> 03:37:32.760]  Very nice.
[03:37:32.760 --> 03:37:38.440]  I mean, up to this point, this whole thing with QAnon has been more or less restricted
[03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:43.240]  to the chans, and that's a very specific subset of the population.
[03:37:43.240 --> 03:37:45.280]  It's a very specialized subset of the population, too.
[03:37:45.280 --> 03:37:53.400]  They're very good at what they do, but they're not everybody, and there are a lot of people
[03:37:53.400 --> 03:37:57.520]  out there that just cannot work on, they just cannot function on the chans the way these
[03:37:57.520 --> 03:38:01.040]  people can, but they're a massive untapped resource themselves.
[03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:08.040]  They have all sorts of connections, I mean, a lot of them could be retired, intel or military.
[03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:11.720]  There's so many people out there from older generations that are not involved in this
[03:38:11.720 --> 03:38:17.680]  fight, and what we're trying to do is get them all of the information.
[03:38:17.680 --> 03:38:20.360]  All of these people who work on these boards, they're incredible, man.
[03:38:20.360 --> 03:38:25.000]  The information they put together, it's phenomenal, totally phenomenal, and we're trying to get
[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:30.320]  that information into a format that these older generations and people who can't understand
[03:38:30.320 --> 03:38:36.320]  the chans and the way they work, get it into a format they can understand and teach them
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:37.320]  how to spread it.
[03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:38.320]  Excellent.
[03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:39.320]  All right.
[03:38:39.320 --> 03:38:43.680]  I want to go to the latest, this is the latest email posted in the PDF that you can download
[03:38:43.680 --> 03:38:47.680]  off of the subreddit, the com before the storm subreddit.
[03:38:47.680 --> 03:38:49.120]  It says, we are moving fast.
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:57.240]  Remember, not all within the C-A, which is C-I-A, D-J, DOJ, F-I, F-B-I are bad apples.
[03:38:57.240 --> 03:39:03.440]  Fast cleaning top, i.e. Rosenstein McCabe is what I think that reads into, or restructuring
[03:39:03.440 --> 03:39:09.880]  one to two, which is interesting, operations 24-7 speed, which is another term for cameras
[03:39:09.880 --> 03:39:11.480]  to start rolling.
[03:39:11.480 --> 03:39:19.520]  So guys, what do you think is in store in the next couple months going into 2018?
[03:39:19.520 --> 03:39:25.200]  Well, one thing that I've heard, I believe, Steve Bannon talk about, I've mentioned this
[03:39:25.200 --> 03:39:31.560]  before in a number of our previous interviews, they called the first year of Trump's presidents
[03:39:31.560 --> 03:39:37.920]  here the year of salvage, trying to salvage everything they could, seeing what was even
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:42.880]  worth salvaging and then trying to get it back into working condition and taking the
[03:39:42.880 --> 03:39:46.720]  mess that Obama and Bush left them and seeing what they can do with it.
[03:39:46.720 --> 03:39:52.760]  And then the year 2018 is supposed to be all about being savage and laying into their enemies.
[03:39:52.760 --> 03:40:01.160]  And we're trying to get into that fight with the president and just take it to him.
[03:40:01.160 --> 03:40:02.160]  Go ahead, Baruch.
[03:40:02.160 --> 03:40:08.480]  Yeah, I think that's absolutely right there.
[03:40:08.480 --> 03:40:15.280]  If what Q is claiming is true, which I have 100% belief, I have 100% confidence that
[03:40:15.280 --> 03:40:20.720]  he is carrying the truth, then the crimes by the so-called elites who rule over us are
[03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:26.720]  also unimaginable that we're going to need all the help we can get to educate the world.
[03:40:26.720 --> 03:40:29.520]  I mean, it's going to be terribly shocking.
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:35.920]  I think that Steve Bannon quoted absolutely right this year was the year of salvage.
[03:40:35.920 --> 03:40:40.400]  It was the year of the operation to clean up the world, and then next year will be the
[03:40:40.400 --> 03:40:47.680]  year of justice, where we see all these people dragged into military tribunals and we will
[03:40:47.680 --> 03:40:54.600]  hear and see all the evidence of their unspeachable crime for ourselves.
[03:40:54.600 --> 03:41:00.960]  But the more people we tell now that that is going to happen, the easier the blow will
[03:41:00.960 --> 03:41:08.400]  be, which is, Q has given us very specific orders that on the chance, on a chance, especially
[03:41:08.400 --> 03:41:14.800]  he said, you guys need to tell people, you need to red pill the normies, as you would
[03:41:14.800 --> 03:41:15.800]  say in Chad's speech.
[03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:19.040]  You need to tell people what's really been going on.
[03:41:19.040 --> 03:41:25.320]  You need to tell them what are so-called elites, like Obama, and the Clintons, and Joe Biden,
[03:41:25.320 --> 03:41:33.640]  and all this elite, super elite crowd, what they really get up to in their spare time.
[03:41:33.640 --> 03:41:34.640]  And that's what we're doing.
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:36.440]  Well, and I think that's the big key.
[03:41:36.440 --> 03:41:41.480]  We can expose the pedophilia, which kind of leads into a pitot gate and pizza gate.
[03:41:41.480 --> 03:41:47.680]  If you can expose the Satan worship, if you can get people to understand that your world
[03:41:47.680 --> 03:41:52.000]  leaders don't think and act like regular people, they're not regular people.
[03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:54.160]  These are predators.
[03:41:54.160 --> 03:42:00.360]  Going back to that post from Friday, December 22nd, why do the clowns do with all the access
[03:42:00.360 --> 03:42:01.560]  codes and tech?
[03:42:01.560 --> 03:42:02.840]  Who controls North Korea?
[03:42:02.840 --> 03:42:05.120]  Who really controls North Korea?
[03:42:05.120 --> 03:42:09.920]  What families are protected using leverage, bank, financial leverage, nuke strike package
[03:42:09.920 --> 03:42:10.920]  leverage?
[03:42:10.920 --> 03:42:12.240]  Who is Iran protected?
[03:42:12.240 --> 03:42:15.280]  Why is Iran funded by the U.S.?
[03:42:15.280 --> 03:42:18.240]  Because we need enemies.
[03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:19.560]  What news about Iran broke?
[03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:21.600]  So this is just a few days ago.
[03:42:21.600 --> 03:42:22.600]  Drugs?
[03:42:22.600 --> 03:42:23.600]  What about WMDs?
[03:42:23.600 --> 03:42:29.160]  Why did Brennan and others provide false intel about North Korea's capability in Iran's tech
[03:42:29.160 --> 03:42:30.560]  and nuclear development?
[03:42:30.560 --> 03:42:31.720]  Plate is full, people.
[03:42:31.720 --> 03:42:32.720]  We need to have faith.
[03:42:32.720 --> 03:42:39.120]  We'll be right back with our final segment with our two guests, Anonymous, 4chan, 8chan,
[03:42:39.120 --> 03:42:40.120]  and Reddit moderators.
[03:42:40.120 --> 03:42:41.120]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:41.120 --> 03:42:43.480]  Pamphlet Anon and Baruch Describe.
[03:42:43.480 --> 03:42:45.840]  Thanks for watching m4s.com forward slash show.
[03:42:45.840 --> 03:42:46.840]  It's the free stream.
[03:42:46.840 --> 03:42:48.560]  You got to get out to everybody.
[03:42:48.560 --> 03:42:53.440]  I'm so excited.
[03:42:53.440 --> 03:43:00.400]  The new product at m4slife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled
[03:43:00.400 --> 03:43:03.720]  to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:09.160]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:43:09.160 --> 03:43:12.160]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:43:12.160 --> 03:43:18.120]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[03:43:18.120 --> 03:43:24.760]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[03:43:24.760 --> 03:43:28.440]  and I came up with our own formulae working with scientists and developers.
[03:43:28.440 --> 03:43:33.240]  Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:38.800]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglenone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[03:43:38.800 --> 03:43:42.640]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:43:42.640 --> 03:43:45.400]  It is amazing.
[03:43:45.400 --> 03:43:53.480]  Red pill now available at m4sstore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[03:43:53.480 --> 03:43:55.080]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:43:55.080 --> 03:43:56.080]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[03:43:56.080 --> 03:44:01.320]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of m4s, and I just
[03:44:01.320 --> 03:44:06.320]  wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic.
[03:44:06.320 --> 03:44:10.400]  And that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the m4.
[03:44:10.400 --> 03:44:15.040]  It might seem like a simple thing, but they're particularly these slogan t-shirts that you
[03:44:15.040 --> 03:44:17.840]  guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[03:44:17.840 --> 03:44:18.840]  Well, thank you.
[03:44:18.840 --> 03:44:23.640]  My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me.
[03:44:23.640 --> 03:44:28.680]  And it's a big deglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag m4s.com
[03:44:28.680 --> 03:44:29.680]  on the right arm.
[03:44:29.680 --> 03:44:35.160]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise
[03:44:35.160 --> 03:44:36.160]  free speech.
[03:44:36.160 --> 03:44:41.680]  The newest one is trigger warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol
[03:44:41.680 --> 03:44:46.160]  of a trigger with a yield sign and then m4s.com on the back.
[03:44:46.160 --> 03:44:53.400]  That is the new shirt of the mind available exclusively at m4s.com.
[03:44:53.400 --> 03:44:59.720]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States powerful 50 billion live organism
[03:44:59.720 --> 03:45:07.560]  probiotic floral life that is so critical to having a healthy gut and a healthy life
[03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:11.000]  and that has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:16.280]  The other part is a compound like mycozx that has all these key ingredients of organic
[03:45:16.280 --> 03:45:20.800]  herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[03:45:20.800 --> 03:45:24.920]  That's why as we go through Christmas and now into the new year, we're extending the

[03:45:53.400 --> 03:45:59.600]  Welcome to the top of the food chain with alpha power by info wars life for those who
[03:45:59.600 --> 03:46:03.480]  want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:46:03.480 --> 03:46:08.840]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of
[03:46:08.840 --> 03:46:11.440]  about 1 to 2% per year.
[03:46:11.440 --> 03:46:18.640]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[03:46:18.640 --> 03:46:23.160]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[03:46:23.160 --> 03:46:24.160]  the market.
[03:46:24.160 --> 03:46:30.640]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[03:46:30.640 --> 03:46:37.600]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma, longia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo

[03:46:56.320 --> 03:47:23.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:23.200 --> 03:47:33.960]  One of the great things about working here at info wars.com is things never kind of stay
[03:47:33.960 --> 03:47:34.960]  the same.
[03:47:34.960 --> 03:47:41.440]  In fact, back over here is where my cubicle used to be where I used to help produce the
[03:47:41.440 --> 03:47:46.760]  Alex Jones show when it was back over in where we now have our podcast studio.
[03:47:46.760 --> 03:47:48.400]  Now this is the main studio.
[03:47:48.400 --> 03:47:52.920]  We have another studio across the hall that Owen Schreuer is about to go live from.
[03:47:52.920 --> 03:47:56.280]  We've just built another studio that's even bigger than this one.
[03:47:56.280 --> 03:47:58.280]  And how do we do that?
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:47:59.800]  We do that with your support.
[03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:02.400]  We don't get funding from the government.
[03:48:02.400 --> 03:48:06.600]  We don't have Uncle Scrooge benefactors.
[03:48:06.600 --> 03:48:11.600]  I guess Uncle Scrooge is the wrong metaphor, but we don't have benefactors dropping money
[03:48:11.600 --> 03:48:12.600]  from the sky.
[03:48:12.600 --> 03:48:17.080]  No, we get support from the people out there who want the truth, who crave the truth and
[03:48:17.080 --> 03:48:20.960]  want to wake up others because that's we're all in this together at the end of the day.
[03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:22.900]  That's why we have our two guests on.
[03:48:22.900 --> 03:48:25.120]  And I just want to tell you that we have some New Year's specials.
[03:48:25.120 --> 03:48:29.800]  We were extending them till the end of the year, got free shipping on just about everything
[03:48:29.800 --> 03:48:30.800]  in the store.
[03:48:30.800 --> 03:48:32.480]  Myco ZX is back in stock.
[03:48:32.480 --> 03:48:40.280]  It's 25% off, but if you get it with the Floralife Combo Pack, it's 50% off both of them together.
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:46.040]  So Floralife's 33% off, Myco ZX is 25% off, but if you get them both together, 50% off.
[03:48:46.040 --> 03:48:50.320]  That's a great deal and really great for your health because the Myco ZX goes after the
[03:48:50.320 --> 03:48:55.320]  bad Candida and the fungus and mold that's inside your system and the Floralife helps
[03:48:55.320 --> 03:48:59.400]  replenish that good bacteria that you need to help digest your food.
[03:48:59.400 --> 03:49:02.680]  That's the basic building block of all your health is having good digestion.
[03:49:02.680 --> 03:49:04.920]  That's where your digestive system lives.
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:07.400]  And then I'm just going to read off the rest of the things that are 50% off.
[03:49:07.400 --> 03:49:08.920]  It's an amazing list.
[03:49:08.920 --> 03:49:13.080]  Supermal Vitality Brain Force, which by the way, I took my two brain force right before
[03:49:13.080 --> 03:49:14.080]  we started.
[03:49:14.080 --> 03:49:15.600]  You can hear the can shaking right here.
[03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:16.600]  Just opened it up.
[03:49:16.600 --> 03:49:18.760]  Here's the cotton that I pulled out right here.
[03:49:18.760 --> 03:49:20.640]  I mean, just had my two brain force.
[03:49:20.640 --> 03:49:26.520]  I feel great, ready to rock and roll, alpha power, 50% off, cell force, 50% off, survival
[03:49:26.520 --> 03:49:31.880]  shield X2, 50% off, vitamin mineral fusion, 50% off, the red pill, 50% off, all super
[03:49:31.880 --> 03:49:32.880]  blue products.
[03:49:32.880 --> 03:49:36.320]  That's the toothpaste, the mouthwash with colloidal silver.
[03:49:36.320 --> 03:49:37.920]  I'm getting so excited.
[03:49:37.920 --> 03:49:42.400]  Colloidal silver and iodine in them, secret 12, 50% off, all info, war's life, select
[03:49:42.400 --> 03:49:44.840]  storeable food, 50% off.
[03:49:44.840 --> 03:49:46.800]  And let's go with the other ones that aren't 50% off.
[03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:50.720]  Univore, floor life, 33% off, pro pure products, 25% off.
[03:49:50.720 --> 03:49:56.200]  All these are with free shipping, DNA force, 33% off, silver bullet, 67% off.
[03:49:56.200 --> 03:50:00.440]  It's like less than $10 a bottle for some of the most powerful colloidal silver on the
[03:50:00.440 --> 03:50:01.440]  market.
[03:50:01.440 --> 03:50:03.800]  $9.95 a bottle.
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:04.800]  Don't stop.
[03:50:04.800 --> 03:50:08.280]  Go to infowarstore.com, check out our great deals, free shipping.
[03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:09.920]  You can't beat them anywhere.
[03:50:09.920 --> 03:50:13.800]  So use some of that money you got from grandma for Christmas and help us out.
[03:50:13.800 --> 03:50:14.800]  Appreciate it.
[03:50:14.800 --> 03:50:17.600]  Now, how do I know that the world is waking up?
[03:50:17.600 --> 03:50:20.040]  It's stories like this from Axios.
[03:50:20.040 --> 03:50:24.480]  Facebook stopped putting disputed flags on fake news because it doesn't work.
[03:50:24.480 --> 03:50:28.440]  Because more people clicked on those stories because they knew it was a bogus flag.
[03:50:28.440 --> 03:50:34.680]  They can see through the BS, Mark Zuckerberg, Zuck, Zuck, Zuck cucked himself.
[03:50:34.680 --> 03:50:38.840]  You could say right there, Facebook stopped putting disputed, so we beat them and less
[03:50:38.840 --> 03:50:41.360]  than like, they put this out two months ago.
[03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:42.820]  It didn't even take that long.
[03:50:42.820 --> 03:50:44.960]  That's how easily we're destroying the lies.
[03:50:44.960 --> 03:50:50.160]  So let's go back to my two guests, Pamphlet Anon and Baruch Describe.
[03:50:50.160 --> 03:50:53.960]  They're both 4chan, 8chan moderators, also on Reddit.
[03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:58.080]  Once again, I want to tell people where they can go to find out all the information on
[03:50:58.080 --> 03:50:59.080]  QAnon.
[03:50:59.080 --> 03:51:05.640]  It is reddit.com forward slash r forward slash cbts underscore stream.
[03:51:05.640 --> 03:51:06.640]  It's kind of a long one.
[03:51:06.640 --> 03:51:12.120]  But once you get that, put that in your browser history and you can go to it at any time.
[03:51:12.120 --> 03:51:16.000]  And it's the subreddit com before the storm.
[03:51:16.000 --> 03:51:24.160]  And I want to go back to that last, from the Q map, from that PDF, or he says, have faith.
[03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:30.000]  We don't live, I know people want to have everything like a drive through mentality.
[03:51:30.000 --> 03:51:31.680]  I order my food and I get it.
[03:51:31.680 --> 03:51:32.680]  It's not like that.
[03:51:32.680 --> 03:51:33.680]  Things take time.
[03:51:33.680 --> 03:51:34.680]  We have to have faith.
[03:51:34.680 --> 03:51:38.440]  Guys, go ahead and each take a couple of minutes, explain why people need to have faith,
[03:51:38.440 --> 03:51:39.640]  but why they also need to get active.
[03:51:39.640 --> 03:51:42.640]  They can't just sit on the sidelines and wait for things to happen.
[03:51:42.640 --> 03:51:43.640]  Yeah, sure.
[03:51:43.640 --> 03:51:44.640]  You're right.
[03:51:44.640 --> 03:51:48.120]  I mean, it takes time, but it does take work.
[03:51:48.120 --> 03:51:50.120]  It takes a lot of work.
[03:51:50.120 --> 03:51:55.520]  The amount of work that the people who are involved in this put into this is just incredible.
[03:51:55.520 --> 03:52:00.960]  And the work they do is, like I said before, totally phenomenal.
[03:52:00.960 --> 03:52:06.840]  But man, some of the things that some of the truths that get revealed through this are
[03:52:06.840 --> 03:52:12.080]  distasteful things, they're disgusting things.
[03:52:12.080 --> 03:52:19.640]  I've seen things I wish I could unsee, man, it's six stuff.
[03:52:19.640 --> 03:52:24.560]  And I think it's important that people really pay attention to this because this stuff is
[03:52:24.560 --> 03:52:26.680]  really terrible stuff.
[03:52:26.680 --> 03:52:32.000]  And it's going on right under our noses where we've been letting it happen for so long.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:37.120]  And people have been trying to get the word out there, but nobody has really truly paid
[03:52:37.120 --> 03:52:38.120]  attention.
[03:52:38.120 --> 03:52:42.000]  And I think the biggest thing about this is that people finally are starting to wake up
[03:52:42.000 --> 03:52:43.000]  to it.
[03:52:43.000 --> 03:52:44.000]  Go ahead, Bruce.
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:45.000]  Yeah, I completely agree, man.
[03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:46.000]  It's a lot of sick stuff.
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:47.000]  Q did warn us.
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:53:01.920]  He said, in fact, he warned us in one of his posts while back, he said, difficult to swallow
[03:53:01.920 --> 03:53:03.600]  but important to progress though.
[03:53:03.600 --> 03:53:06.800]  And I thought, yes, you're going to tell us the truth, aren't you?
[03:53:06.800 --> 03:53:08.800]  Do the elites worship Satan?
[03:53:08.800 --> 03:53:13.040]  Sorry, I don't have it right in front of me, so I'm paraphrasing, but I'm pretty close.
[03:53:13.040 --> 03:53:14.680]  Do the elites worship Satan?
[03:53:14.680 --> 03:53:17.000]  I mean, do they go to Epstein Island?
[03:53:17.000 --> 03:53:22.480]  That's Jeffrey Epstein, the man who is at the center of the Peterphal scandal during
[03:53:22.480 --> 03:53:24.720]  Bill Clinton's presidency.
[03:53:24.720 --> 03:53:25.960]  What do they do there?
[03:53:25.960 --> 03:53:31.520]  What symbol is on the top of the temple on Epstein Island?
[03:53:31.520 --> 03:53:37.040]  So yeah, these are unimaginable horrors if you've never been exposed to them before,
[03:53:37.040 --> 03:53:41.400]  but they need to be faced.
[03:53:41.400 --> 03:53:45.840]  There is an awful lot of information out there.
[03:53:45.840 --> 03:53:50.960]  The problem is, because it's so horrifying, it attracts a lot of disinformation.
[03:53:50.960 --> 03:53:55.440]  Thank you to the clowns for that, but there is a lot of good information.
[03:53:55.440 --> 03:54:03.080]  I would recommend reading the books by people like Kathy O'Brien, people like Bryce Taylor,
[03:54:03.080 --> 03:54:08.000]  and going into them with a mindset that this woman is telling the truth.
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:13.600]  And then you can start red-pilling yourself very quickly.
[03:54:13.600 --> 03:54:19.280]  He mentions Snow White, let's see, I don't know, maybe 20 times in his posts.
[03:54:19.280 --> 03:54:21.720]  He also mentions the Godfather 3.
[03:54:21.720 --> 03:54:23.840]  What does that represent in these?
[03:54:23.840 --> 03:54:27.280]  He mentions the Godfather 3 almost as many times as Snow White.
[03:54:27.280 --> 03:54:31.920]  So go ahead, what does that represent?
[03:54:31.920 --> 03:54:36.200]  These are the lovely little cryptic clues that we love to spend hours and hours trying
[03:54:36.200 --> 03:54:37.200]  to unravel.
[03:54:37.200 --> 03:54:44.760]  So Snow White is the CIA supercomputer called Hammer, H-A-M-R, and it's hosted at Amazon's
[03:54:44.760 --> 03:54:46.480]  data center.
[03:54:46.480 --> 03:54:53.640]  And Snow White in the seventh world is the CIA, we believe, again, this is not confirmed.
[03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:59.120]  We believe that it's their supercomputer infrastructure that they use to conduct domestic
[03:54:59.120 --> 03:55:03.640]  surveillance, which of course is entirely illegal, but that's never stopped them before.
[03:55:03.640 --> 03:55:10.120]  So Snow White in the seventh world's reference is to the clowns in action.
[03:55:10.120 --> 03:55:12.120]  His film references are fascinating.
[03:55:12.120 --> 03:55:17.240]  There's the sum of all peers, which as you know, is about a suitcase nuke, it's a Tom
[03:55:17.240 --> 03:55:22.000]  County story about a suitcase nuke that goes off on the continental US.
[03:55:22.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  And Jack Lyon discovers that it was a terrorist group because of the uranium signature.
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:28.000]  Very good book.
[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:30.000]  One of my favorite novels of it.
[03:55:30.000 --> 03:55:34.920]  Then there's the Hunforell October, where it's just like maybe a little piece of the
[03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:38.200]  plot is the key that we need to grab.
[03:55:38.200 --> 03:55:44.920]  But on our channel, on our channel, Summon On will know that, oh, this book really refers
[03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:48.760]  to this, and then we'll find the right answer.
[03:55:48.760 --> 03:55:52.840]  So I can't tell you for sure what we're up to, I think we had October means the torpedo
[03:55:52.840 --> 03:55:55.640]  that comes back and destroys the Russian set.
[03:55:55.640 --> 03:55:56.640]  Right, right.
[03:55:56.640 --> 03:56:00.640]  Hillary and Obama's Russian marriages is actually backfire.
[03:56:00.640 --> 03:56:05.760]  Is their torpedo and it's coming around because they did the maneuver, Trump did the maneuver
[03:56:05.760 --> 03:56:06.760]  and it's pop.
[03:56:06.760 --> 03:56:07.760]  Yeah.
[03:56:07.760 --> 03:56:08.760]  Okay.
[03:56:08.760 --> 03:56:09.760]  That makes sense.
[03:56:09.760 --> 03:56:10.760]  Exactly.
[03:56:10.760 --> 03:56:11.760]  Yeah.
[03:56:11.760 --> 03:56:12.760]  Yeah.
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:13.760]  Godfather III, a number of possibilities.
[03:56:13.760 --> 03:56:18.600]  The plot is the Pope, obviously, the Pope is obviously asked Michael Corleone.
[03:56:18.600 --> 03:56:21.600]  For some financial help in exchange for control.
[03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:27.440]  So is it as simple as that or is it as simple as one of the, one of the very first lines
[03:56:27.440 --> 03:56:33.000]  in the movie where Michael says, children are the most precious wealth in all the world.
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:35.440]  You know, the only treasure we're having is there's something like that.
[03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:36.920]  I mean, is that for him?
[03:56:36.920 --> 03:56:42.120]  We don't know yet, but we will because he will turn up again and he will explain this.
[03:56:42.120 --> 03:56:45.560]  So we're confident that yeah, all the answers are coming.
[03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:46.560]  Excellent.
[03:56:46.560 --> 03:56:47.560]  Yep.
[03:56:47.560 --> 03:56:49.120]  I want to remind everybody where they can go.
[03:56:49.120 --> 03:56:50.520]  We got it like a minute left.
[03:56:50.520 --> 03:56:51.520]  Yeah.
[03:56:51.520 --> 03:56:55.600]  Listen, if I could, if I could expand real quick on what I said before, I think, I think
[03:56:55.600 --> 03:57:01.280]  it's really important to mention that this is not just Trump supporters involved in this.
[03:57:01.280 --> 03:57:06.400]  This is people from all sides that are waking up to what's going on here.
[03:57:06.400 --> 03:57:09.320]  And I think it's important that we recognize that.
[03:57:09.320 --> 03:57:15.160]  And we were, a lot of us really need to kind of bury the hatchet, especially for something
[03:57:15.160 --> 03:57:16.160]  this big.
[03:57:16.160 --> 03:57:17.680]  Because we're fighting evil.
[03:57:17.680 --> 03:57:19.120]  We need to come together for this man.
[03:57:19.120 --> 03:57:20.120]  Yes.
[03:57:20.120 --> 03:57:21.120]  This is sick stuff.
[03:57:21.120 --> 03:57:22.680]  And it really needs to be taken care of.
[03:57:22.680 --> 03:57:24.000]  Gentlemen, thank you for joining me.
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:27.560]  We definitely have to do something in the New Year long form, commercial free, hopefully
[03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:31.920]  in our new podcast studio, which can all be built thanks to you by going to infowarstore.com
[03:57:31.920 --> 03:57:33.600]  and checking out some of the great deals.

[03:57:42.080 --> 03:57:43.080]  Not a group.
[03:57:43.080 --> 03:57:44.080]  You developed living defense for us.
[03:57:44.080 --> 03:57:45.360]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:57:45.360 --> 03:57:47.080]  Why is this so good?
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:51.640]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:57:51.640 --> 03:57:56.400]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[03:57:56.400 --> 03:57:57.400]  my system.
[03:57:57.400 --> 03:58:03.400]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[03:58:03.400 --> 03:58:09.160]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[03:58:09.160 --> 03:58:11.800]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:58:11.800 --> 03:58:12.800]  These are all parasites.
[03:58:12.800 --> 03:58:15.520]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[03:58:15.520 --> 03:58:16.760]  You have the name in there.
[03:58:16.760 --> 03:58:19.840]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:58:19.840 --> 03:58:23.120]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[03:58:23.120 --> 03:58:24.120]  All right.
[03:58:24.120 --> 03:58:26.320]  Well, I'm glad we got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:58:26.320 --> 03:58:27.480]  It just came back in yesterday.

[03:58:54.720 --> 03:58:56.360]  So what do we do about it?
