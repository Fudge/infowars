[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:28.600]  you know it clicked that Wayne Madsen three four months ago maybe longer on the nightly
[00:28.600 --> 00:36.720]  news said he had confidential federal informants that there were wiretaps of Attorney General see
[00:36.720 --> 00:41.440]  it's not just a high-level just just from source it's supposedly of him that they killed Judge
[00:41.440 --> 00:45.640]  Roll and tried to kill Giffords because they were investigating it then I talked to some
[00:45.640 --> 00:52.280]  state legislators and people in New Mexico who said that was the word they'd heard this was
[00:52.280 --> 00:58.880]  going on all over the West Texas New Mexico into Arizona it's just that's Madsen is so wild
[00:58.880 --> 01:05.400]  I mean he's the stuff he talks about sometimes sounds so wild it turns out to be true he didn't
[01:05.400 --> 01:11.720]  work for the NSA all that I mean it is just crazy it is just crazy because now they're
[01:11.720 --> 01:16.960]  they're revealing secret wiretaps it's been read in the congressional record that they got
[01:16.960 --> 01:22.040]  holder I mean this is this is the White House constates terror attacks anything a new war
[01:22.040 --> 01:28.560]  distract from this this is just wild this is absolutely wild but again he's the sacrificial
[01:28.560 --> 01:34.240]  political lamb now that they want to divert us off of the socials health care thing that is being
[01:34.240 --> 01:40.320]  spun as a victory because it'll get Romney and who authored it I mean talk about delusion and I
[01:40.320 --> 01:46.680]  understand politically yes that's true it would probably get Romney in but Obama's just a puppet
[01:46.680 --> 01:52.720]  the system the banks wanted this okay that's enough I'm ranting Courtney in Virginia up there by the
[01:52.720 --> 01:59.120]  scene of the crime you're on the air welcome hi thank you Alex it's good to be on I've been
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.160]  listening for a while but my first time falling in thank you for putting up with me I know I'm
[02:03.160 --> 02:11.400]  noxious go ahead no so I mean I appreciate the the emotion at least you know it's it's different
[02:11.400 --> 02:14.880]  than what you see on the zombie mainstream that's for sure we're here to get you on the
[02:14.880 --> 02:21.320]  zombification yes yeah and your broadcast that's definitely played a large part I wanted to kind
[02:21.320 --> 02:26.600]  of throw some out there and see if it was something you had considered I have a sales and
[02:26.600 --> 02:31.320]  marketing background so I tend to think of how I can generate more leads or more people
[02:31.320 --> 02:39.240]  and I when this Obamacare ruling came out I didn't see much of this overlining but I did see maybe
[02:39.240 --> 02:47.960]  an opportunity for you if you were to maybe devote like a segment of your regular broadcast to like
[02:47.960 --> 02:55.800]  Obamacare 101 or what's in the bill the implications we could reach out here basically they can change
[02:55.800 --> 03:00.920]  it whenever they want however they want it's a federal reserve takeover of 35 million people
[03:00.920 --> 03:07.480]  but it also takes over the general healthcare system it lets the IRS you have to file with them
[03:07.480 --> 03:11.080]  the type of health care you have they can now take money out of your account I mean it's just
[03:11.080 --> 03:18.920]  the IRS and the nanny state sticking their hand down your pants like the TSA basically absolutely
[03:18.920 --> 03:25.400]  and but I think you know because there's a large segment of people of people and who are still caught
[03:25.400 --> 03:31.000]  in the left right paradigm so they you know may identify themselves as you know with the GOP or
[03:31.000 --> 03:38.360]  Republican who are semi-awake but you know have the potential to go back to sleep or or you know
[03:38.360 --> 03:43.160]  along those lines but Obamacare is definitely one of those issues that a lot of people are up
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.440]  in arms about and for good reason so I was just kind of positioning that to you that maybe if
[03:48.440 --> 03:56.360]  you were to do just a portion of your broadcast to Obamacare and consolidate all of the information
[03:56.360 --> 04:02.680]  that we the listeners could spread the word that it's happening and get more people to tune in who
[04:02.680 --> 04:10.360]  wouldn't otherwise know of you or or necessarily you know you're right on on on issues of Obamacare
[04:10.360 --> 04:15.960]  gun restrictions anything we should and we do write articles about it but didn't boil it all down
[04:15.960 --> 04:23.400]  but I think we posted an article this morning you know basically titled you know 20 reasons
[04:23.400 --> 04:28.200]  why Obamacare is a disaster and I think that's a good article to go read it's now scrolled off
[04:28.200 --> 04:33.800]  into the featured archive but there's that red link that says breaking that's the rss feed key
[04:33.800 --> 04:38.040]  to click on that red link at the top of info wars.com just see everything that's been up there in
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.160]  that day and there's also top story archive because we there's so much is going up there it just
[04:43.160 --> 04:49.640]  scrolls off scrolls off but that's a great point thank you so much Frank Serpico a legendary police

[08:25.960 --> 08:35.960]  eric belair aka george arwell wrote that in a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a
[08:35.960 --> 08:43.480]  revolutionary act and frank serpicoe is probably one of the most famous police officers in u.s.
[08:43.480 --> 08:48.680]  or world history of course he's had big movies made about him with al Pacino playing the part of
[08:48.680 --> 08:55.480]  frank serpicoe and he joined us last year for a visit and and we've got him for about 45 minutes
[08:55.480 --> 09:01.000]  or so today the last few minutes we're going to have an update on the secret wiretaps of eric
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.360]  holter being revealed and that story at the hill crash we were able to find a blog copy of it and
[09:06.360 --> 09:12.200]  posted it up at info wars.com if you want to read that this is really coming to a head very very
[09:12.200 --> 09:19.800]  quickly with talk of the house going to the grand jury in the district of columbia as
[09:19.800 --> 09:25.960]  in calling for criminal charges this is getting very nixonian and we'll talk about general
[09:25.960 --> 09:31.000]  corruption you know i wanted to get frank serpicoe on about police corruption what he witnessed in
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.840]  general society this last time we talked mainly about his story but there's so much happening
[09:36.840 --> 09:42.520]  i just want to get his view overall on the state of the world today he doesn't really need any
[09:42.520 --> 09:47.000]  introduction but he joined the new or police department 59 and police officer for 12 years
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.720]  his attempts to report police corruption to his superiors and the department fell on deaf ears
[09:51.720 --> 09:57.960]  until he was shot but basically over to to boil it all down and then he moved to switzerland for
[09:57.960 --> 10:01.960]  a while and i could say a lot more about him but best-selling books have been written about him
[10:02.520 --> 10:08.600]  big blockbuster hollywood films uh but he's a pretty humble guy uh frank good to have you
[10:08.600 --> 10:13.720]  back on with us today i appreciate you joining us hey alex it's a pleasure and the first thing i
[10:13.720 --> 10:21.960]  want to do is uh apologize for the last show when my phone went bust and uh i found myself screaming
[10:21.960 --> 10:28.200]  into the wall there so how's the transmission today it is good sir the transmission is uh
[10:28.200 --> 10:34.360]  super duper and it's good to have you frank i want to ask you out of the gates instead of asking
[10:34.360 --> 10:40.360]  questions what is front and center on your radar screen right now we haven't talked before this
[10:40.360 --> 10:46.520]  interview what what is front and center in your mind right now well first of all uh when you
[10:46.520 --> 10:55.560]  start the show you mentioned the name uh or yes sir did you mean george or well the guy who wrote
[10:55.560 --> 11:05.560]  1984 yes sir okay so we know where we're at you know i and um foremost on my mind is that uh you
[11:05.560 --> 11:13.480]  can't trust the government you can't trust the media and uh you can't trust the medical profession
[11:13.480 --> 11:22.040]  and i want to say i mean there are always exceptions to the rule but uh uh you know what happens is
[11:22.040 --> 11:28.200]  you have these pundits they get their degrees and they write their books and they change history
[11:28.200 --> 11:36.360]  they're uh revisionist so you got to be careful you know what you're reading and who wrote it and
[11:36.360 --> 11:45.400]  and what their intention is so um uh we were talking about fast and furious and uh i was wondering
[11:45.400 --> 11:54.840]  how many of your listeners remember the iran contra affair with ollie north and israel you know
[11:54.840 --> 12:05.960]  delivering guns to iran and then also israel seeking uh an american the uss liberty and then all kinds
[12:05.960 --> 12:12.760]  of cover-ups were written they didn't know it was an american ship but uh i heard one of the men on
[12:12.760 --> 12:20.760]  board saying he could see the pilots as they flew by and the amazing thing is is what this government
[12:20.760 --> 12:28.280]  allows others to get away with when they slaughter americans and they claim to have our best interest
[12:28.280 --> 12:34.680]  at heart so what i'm saying is no you can't trust the government if they told me uh the fun was
[12:34.680 --> 12:43.720]  shining i'd bring my umbrella out you know you make the parallel to iran contra that's guns out
[12:43.720 --> 12:48.520]  of the country drugs into the country now even the washington post is having a report on the fact
[12:48.520 --> 12:54.200]  that fast and furious has connections to narcotics uh came out in federal court they were authorizing
[12:54.200 --> 13:00.120]  cartels to bring drugs in that the feds are arming street gangs in the u.s i mean literally fast
[13:00.120 --> 13:06.840]  and furious is the tip of the iceberg from your decades of studying this and living it uh and and
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.600]  i mean your words last time you said almost all the detectives around you were on the take or
[13:10.600 --> 13:16.040]  corrupt i said what was the percentage you said basically all but but i what what would you call
[13:16.040 --> 13:21.960]  the system correction there you said tip of the iceberg i want to make that the tip of the dumb
[13:21.960 --> 13:32.840]  heap but um like i say i hear sometimes cops they say to me oh you uh it's just like if you speak
[13:32.840 --> 13:38.280]  up they say you're anti-american i say no i'm just anti-corruption i'm not anti-police i'm
[13:38.280 --> 13:48.760]  anti-corruption just last week a new york city police detective gave me his his shield his detective
[13:48.760 --> 13:58.040]  shield and his patrolman shield that was awarded to him by his narcotics blog when he retired and
[13:58.040 --> 14:05.080]  i don't know how many of your listeners know about uh the palladium murder and the the gentleman
[14:05.080 --> 14:12.360]  that i'm speaking of and others that i will speak of i say they are truly worthy of the
[14:12.360 --> 14:20.440]  title of new york's finest and the world's best detectives but it seems they are at a minimum
[14:21.080 --> 14:28.840]  or if they're not their buddies are afraid to speak up because they will be made examples of
[14:28.840 --> 14:35.720]  and and in this case the detective i'm speaking of and and the your listeners can go online his
[14:35.720 --> 14:45.960]  name is bobby of dollarado and he found that two men were charged with murder they were an even
[14:45.960 --> 14:54.520]  at the scene and they served uh 10 years and then two years mayor uh in a penitentiary um
[14:54.520 --> 15:03.400]  and he's not to keep them in there but to get them out of there and and that's what he did uh so
[15:03.400 --> 15:12.120]  there are good police out there but uh the problem is that at the top like with bobby's case um he
[15:12.120 --> 15:20.600]  becomes the victim um and um and in cases that are going on in new york city today that cops that
[15:20.600 --> 15:31.320]  are exposing these illegal search and seizures were last year alone 700 000 stops and frisk were
[15:31.320 --> 15:39.240]  performed by the new york city police department and one of the men who's been suspended and uh
[15:39.240 --> 15:50.040]  uh uh because he refused uh to uh give people uh uh summons is you know not committing any
[15:50.040 --> 15:56.200]  crime and in one case uh lieutenant said to him give that guy a ticket and he said what's for
[15:57.000 --> 16:06.600]  he said um an unlicensed dog the guy said he doesn't even have a dog but you know who's going to
[16:06.600 --> 16:12.360]  to contest it when a cop gives you a ticket uh what do you want to do bring your dog to court
[16:12.360 --> 16:19.960]  and uh you know so the system is broken and the men that want to speak out they become the victims
[16:19.960 --> 16:28.520]  and there's others i i don't want to talk too much about them because um um you know only the worst
[16:28.520 --> 16:34.120]  will happen to them well that was my next question that was my next question a legendary frank serpico
[16:34.120 --> 16:39.080]  a police officer whistleblower hero uh shot and almost killed for telling the truth exposing
[16:39.080 --> 16:44.040]  government drug dealing uh that was my next question and it seems like you're getting there
[16:44.040 --> 16:50.680]  before i even ask it compared to the incredible corruption you saw in the new york police
[16:50.680 --> 16:57.640]  department uh now with your sources people that obviously come to you is it is it worse today
[16:57.640 --> 17:05.640]  or how is the corruption different um well the corrupt this is what i'm told by men in the street
[17:05.640 --> 17:11.720]  the corruption is different is that cops don't want to be cops and bosses don't want to be bosses
[17:11.720 --> 17:17.080]  nobody wants to take any chances nobody wants to stick their neck out they just want to collect
[17:17.080 --> 17:23.320]  their paycheck and go home true in my day they had what they call the pad that was actually a pad
[17:23.320 --> 17:30.360]  with a list of all the uh the numbers runners and the banks and the dealers you know who paid off
[17:30.360 --> 17:37.720]  and if you didn't pay off uh you'd get arrested and sometimes worse and uh intimidated and and
[17:37.720 --> 17:44.280]  if they found that you didn't have all your employees listed i'm talking about the underworld
[17:44.280 --> 17:51.480]  you would get fined they ran it like a like a business now there are a lot of police that say
[17:51.480 --> 17:58.280]  oh come on a cop would never do that drugs that's horrible off and but what happened to show you
[17:58.280 --> 18:08.040]  how the line is so thin i started out in plain clothes that was bison gambling and uh you would
[18:08.040 --> 18:15.960]  get an envelope every month without doing anything in fact for doing nothing uh and for not arresting
[18:15.960 --> 18:24.600]  the people that were violating the law so the the uh the rule in the police department at the time
[18:24.600 --> 18:33.560]  was you had to serve four years in plain clothes and then they said if you keep your nose clean uh you
[18:33.560 --> 18:40.920]  will be automatically made a detective so here's what happens and they had this expression the
[18:40.920 --> 18:47.640]  graph eaters and the meat eaters and the graph eaters were the ones that just grazed you know
[18:47.640 --> 18:54.040]  like uh they might take uh traffic money or gambling money or prostitution money and they'd
[18:54.040 --> 19:00.920]  say well you know that's you know that's just uh devices that people want anyway but never
[19:00.920 --> 19:09.000]  touched that dirty drug money so here's what happened after four years of grazing on a salary
[19:09.000 --> 19:16.920]  that a police officer isn't accustomed to and these guys would hire yachts on the weekend
[19:16.920 --> 19:23.320]  they would come to work as in the case of a guard in the dirty 30 they would sell guns shields
[19:23.320 --> 19:32.680]  narcotics one guy sniffed cocaine off his um a cruiser off his police car and he would never been
[19:32.680 --> 19:39.160]  have been caught if it wasn't for a sting operation by another agency in another county
[19:39.160 --> 19:46.760]  where he left the city limits to go and um and squeeze some more drug dealers so this isn't
[19:46.760 --> 19:53.400]  something that was caught by the nypb themselves and what i'm saying is after you get used to that
[19:53.400 --> 20:00.920]  lifestyle for four years all of a sudden you're in narcotics now you think all of a sudden you're
[20:00.920 --> 20:07.160]  going to change your lifestyle so now you become the meat eater and the meat eaters are uh blood
[20:07.160 --> 20:14.920]  thirsty carnivorous and they'll do anything for a buck and now our government is converting from
[20:14.920 --> 20:20.600]  being good old boy boss hog or what i'd you know would term a boss hog is what you call a grass
[20:20.600 --> 20:28.200]  eater to now just savage out of control eyes bugging out listen i've been to new york quite a few
[20:28.200 --> 20:32.120]  times and i've seen people ask for directions who aren't from new york and be screamed at
[20:32.120 --> 20:37.720]  and just the example of you know a corruption accelerating uh and i've had i mean i've seen
[20:37.720 --> 20:45.240]  videos of our reporters and in in in one case luke radowski was protesting out front building seven
[20:46.200 --> 20:53.080]  talking about larry silverstein's involvement in 9 11 and the security guards come out looking like
[20:53.080 --> 20:59.640]  guys out of goodfellas smoking pipes you know the classic thug with a pipe he's a gentleman and going
[21:00.520 --> 21:08.360]  with a cartoon gangster accent uh going you know what's gonna happen we're gonna call the police
[21:08.360 --> 21:13.720]  and say your cameras a bomb you're gonna get charged with terrorism and i know i know you're
[21:13.720 --> 21:20.120]  not a terrorist but you're gonna get 30 days in the hole the cops show up the gangsters literally
[21:20.120 --> 21:25.480]  out of central casting but i was a hollywood director i would hire them for sopranos then
[21:25.480 --> 21:31.960]  commands 20 police or so who grab him and take his camera and say it's a gun and a bomb i mean
[21:31.960 --> 21:38.440]  this is listen i have this on tape they didn't even bother to erase the tape they frame him on
[21:38.440 --> 21:44.920]  tape and don't even care and don't even erase the tape that to me showed such incredible
[21:44.920 --> 21:53.480]  it's such incredible hubris that they and now i see footage that um our uh correspondent shoot
[21:53.480 --> 22:01.160]  new york where the police walk around with with cigarettes and and and cigars uh arresting abc
[22:01.160 --> 22:07.240]  news reporters there's footage of that online with their hats on sideways i mean now it's becoming
[22:07.240 --> 22:12.600]  comical and and now i'm seeing in other parts of the country take seattle where i saw articles
[22:12.600 --> 22:17.640]  even in their local paper where the police in some areas own half the bars because they will sell
[22:17.640 --> 22:23.480]  themselves drugs in the bathroom and then take the people's bars so now they're not even shaking
[22:23.480 --> 22:29.240]  down criminals which is the old excuse as you know for grazers or whatever so so they're becoming
[22:29.240 --> 22:36.280]  survival the fittest the the bigger the meat eater the more power they get and so now what a
[22:36.280 --> 22:42.920]  meat eater would have been 20 years ago is now a grazer do you see what i'm saying yeah yeah there was
[22:42.920 --> 22:51.720]  one uh uh uh precinct uh commander he even uh complained to this guy instead if it wasn't for
[22:51.720 --> 22:59.160]  that f and so pico i was been a millionaire today so it shows you the amount of money that's floating
[22:59.160 --> 23:07.400]  out there and in the new york times op ed monday june 18th of this year is an article here called
[23:07.400 --> 23:15.800]  policing by the numbers and it's uh written by a john eterno uh who's a retired new york city
[23:15.800 --> 23:24.200]  police captain he's a professor of criminal justice uh and all that stuff but he says um
[23:24.200 --> 23:33.160]  um an officer assigned to an impact zone high crime area told me that the constitution does quote
[23:33.160 --> 23:40.280]  the constitution has been thrown out the window when it comes to stops he's given strict daily
[23:40.280 --> 23:46.680]  quotas and asked at the end of his tour about his numbers an officer who fails to meet the
[23:46.680 --> 23:55.320]  required number for the day is berated sometimes in front of his not allowed time off and given
[23:55.320 --> 24:03.080]  unpalatable work assignments nothing is asked about maintaining order interacting with the
[24:03.080 --> 24:11.240]  community or other kinds of police works the result of this performance culture needless
[24:11.240 --> 24:18.040]  summons is for minor violations putting one's feet on the subway seats playing chess in a park
[24:18.600 --> 24:26.200]  failing to wear a seat belt another quota driven activity this does not make more efficient policing
[24:26.200 --> 24:35.240]  etc so that's where it is today i am at another police officer said to me uh our top today is
[24:35.240 --> 24:44.200]  nothing more than an armed tax collector i mean these people who have legitimate permits these
[24:44.200 --> 24:51.080]  vendors on the street trying to make a living uh they're given fines at times up to a thousand
[24:51.080 --> 24:57.720]  dollars how are they ever going to pay these fines and and the crazy thing is if you go out of the
[24:57.720 --> 25:04.040]  city and you can make a turn you can make a right turn on a red light uh when it's safe
[25:04.040 --> 25:10.440]  in the city you try that and the ticket is like a hundred dollars they pull your cars away it's
[25:10.440 --> 25:15.800]  just now listen i talked to people that i've known for like 16 years he owned a couple dump
[25:15.800 --> 25:20.840]  trucks made a decent living now he's just out of business because of the fines and fees they'll
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.400]  even pull a new truck over and say there's dirt on the bumper here in austin and the cops just
[25:25.400 --> 25:30.440]  don't care they're all people are going bankrupt only big companies can come in and then pass on
[25:30.440 --> 25:36.200]  the expenses to people that hire them it's destroying the economy and the government loves it they love
[25:36.200 --> 25:42.520]  it it's just i mean they're going to kill this country yeah yeah this guy goes on to say policing
[25:42.520 --> 25:50.200]  in a democracy is not easy nor is it meant to be reducing crime numbers is simple if you disregard
[25:50.200 --> 25:58.040]  basic rights ignore victims mandate quotas and manipulate numbers the lunacy of this policy
[25:58.040 --> 26:05.400]  performance culture can end only with stranger leadership greater transparency uh stronger
[26:05.400 --> 26:12.120]  leadership that is uh which would be strange uh greater transparency and more meaningful
[26:12.120 --> 26:18.760]  relationship with the community and then it says it is worth heeding what detective frank
[26:18.760 --> 26:27.480]  surfaco testified on police corruption told the nap commission in 1971 quote the department
[26:27.480 --> 26:33.880]  must realize that an effective continuing relationship between the police and the public
[26:33.880 --> 26:41.320]  is more important than an impressive arrest record uh and that's what i became a cop for
[26:42.280 --> 26:47.080]  frank where is it all going where is it all going because you're in one jurisdiction
[26:47.080 --> 26:52.280]  and the police are changing flat tires helping people actually going after bad guys but that's
[26:52.280 --> 26:56.360]  more and more rare and you go in another jurisdiction i don't care if it's in the south the north
[26:56.360 --> 27:03.160]  the west and the police are crazed wild eyed thugs who instinctively i i can just by their
[27:03.160 --> 27:08.600]  bearing automatically tell her the enemy of of society i mean where is this going from your
[27:08.600 --> 27:15.400]  research and your experience if the corruption continues to grow this fast well it's uh it's
[27:15.400 --> 27:24.040]  not going good uh if it's not stopped because uh this kind of activity doesn't happen if it's not
[27:24.040 --> 27:31.400]  condoned at the top uh for example the uh the commissioner in new york in charge of press
[27:31.400 --> 27:39.320]  relations uh you know he commented about me he says my comments are born out of ignorance uh
[27:40.120 --> 27:47.320]  from being away for 40 years and my response to him is well what's his excuse doesn't he watch
[27:47.320 --> 27:54.440]  and see uh you know all these videos that are being taken by independent people of the harassment
[27:54.440 --> 28:02.600]  and uh that's my question how could police walk up on a video and say we're going to say your
[28:02.600 --> 28:09.320]  camera is a gun and a bomb and and then and then and frame someone on tape and not even care to
[28:09.320 --> 28:15.720]  erase the tape i mean where this confidence says they're going to get promoted for stomping on
[28:15.720 --> 28:21.640]  somebody's rights and setting them up well i didn't know if you know the case of adrian
[28:21.640 --> 28:29.880]  schoolcraft uh a police officer who refused to go along and they broke into his house that night
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.640]  handcuffed him behind his back and took him to the psych award where he was handcuffed to a
[28:35.640 --> 28:41.960]  gurney for six days and then he read the police blog and nobody wants to believe it because
[28:41.960 --> 28:52.360]  uh you can't just psycho a guy with uh you know um but if it's the mayor and the police commissioner
[28:52.360 --> 29:01.480]  who's behind it then you know who's gonna say no and um so it's really terrible and what amazes
[29:01.480 --> 29:11.080]  me is that the the people aren't up in arms as they uh did uh in um in egypt you know you think
[29:11.080 --> 29:21.400]  the people would have had enough uh and say no more but um somehow um i'm sure you're familiar
[29:21.400 --> 29:30.920]  with uh young marcus tuia cicero who back in uh it was 70 years before the birth of christ
[29:30.920 --> 29:37.800]  and the roman republic uh the foremost power of its day had reached its zenith and its leadership
[29:37.800 --> 29:43.480]  had attained unbound wealth and unstincted power the rules were intolerant of restraint
[29:43.480 --> 29:47.320]  indifference to demand i'll tell you what frank surfer goes stay there gotta go to bright come back
[29:47.320 --> 29:57.000]  with a quote coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting

[33:13.480 --> 33:20.280]  bottom line he said he said his mind control and then that that bumper plays frank repeat what
[33:20.280 --> 33:27.160]  you were saying off there um i mean on all those issues you were saying well your show says it all
[33:27.160 --> 33:33.480]  wore on for your mind what's going on here well the human race has been torn to the highest bitter
[33:33.480 --> 33:41.400]  you know i mean it amazes me that these young kids kowtow you know to all these uh you know the
[33:41.400 --> 33:49.560]  pope the queen the media the government you know the queen who is one of the uh whatever she is she
[33:49.560 --> 33:55.640]  certainly not a princess you know the queen b with the bees works more than the rest of the workers
[33:56.760 --> 34:04.280]  these people who have exploited the world and races uh that people should curtsy to them
[34:04.280 --> 34:11.800]  i mean it is mind boggling it's insane that they think that they're better than the rest of the human
[34:11.800 --> 34:16.440]  race i mean you know what i'm talking about where you know if you're with the prince or you're with
[34:16.440 --> 34:21.640]  them you have to curtsy my god i mean one of the people going to wake up you know they're being
[34:21.640 --> 34:29.400]  held prisoners in their own minds you're absolutely right and then you know i get a letter from the
[34:29.400 --> 34:36.360]  NAACP which i remember and uh you know i believe in equality and justice that they say frank taking
[34:36.360 --> 34:42.360]  your stand for what is right sometimes comes with grave consequences yes that's true and then they
[34:42.360 --> 34:49.640]  go to taking office as you know attorney general what they're saying sadly extreme elements within
[34:49.640 --> 35:00.040]  the u.s house are threatening the attorney but i mean what's happening it's um there are no principles
[35:00.040 --> 35:08.360]  it should be principles above personality and um it's all this cronyism and i wish uh these young
[35:08.360 --> 35:15.000]  kids today they would wake up and um well you remember what happened at kent state when the
[35:15.000 --> 35:20.600]  national guard opened fire on its own citizens maybe that's what they're afraid of but um well
[35:20.600 --> 35:24.440]  let me raise that because it's funny you brought that up they're announcing more more military
[35:24.440 --> 35:29.160]  on the streets secretary of the army wants to station a brigade in every city it's not for
[35:29.160 --> 35:34.360]  al-qaeda now they're their little buddies they're using over in libyan syria it's for us they're
[35:34.360 --> 35:40.120]  announcing armed drones they're announcing 450 million rounds of 40 cal hollow point four
[35:40.120 --> 35:47.080]  citizens homeland security is getting mobile armored uh pill boxes uh what do you think this whole
[35:47.080 --> 35:54.360]  buildup is for sarpica well uh if it's uh the way it's happening it's not for the good it's just
[35:54.360 --> 36:06.840]  the press the masses uh we got another um uh syria uh you know it's going to be uh the u.s is uh
[36:06.840 --> 36:13.080]  if i say the united states but the people have to get united against oppression is what they have
[36:13.080 --> 36:20.440]  to do and this is what the government is afraid of so uh they're going to uh you know control the
[36:20.440 --> 36:29.880]  people by force of arms and uh you know i mean i live in a country i mean uh you know what they
[36:29.880 --> 36:37.640]  say um i can spend i can spend a buck i could um run a trial line and a country boy can survive you
[36:37.640 --> 36:46.280]  know uh the people are arming up uh they don't trust the government so uh you know it's it's not
[36:46.280 --> 36:52.520]  just a few it's those that are awake and you know are they going to say that i'm you know i'm i'm
[36:52.520 --> 37:01.880]  talking uh uh you know uh accuse me of uh trying to cite the masses you don't know what this
[37:01.880 --> 37:08.040]  government is capable of and let me tell you you know you were saying i wasn't switzerland you know
[37:08.040 --> 37:15.000]  why i left switzerland because i was run out by the fbi uh because they wanted me to come back to
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.960]  new york and be a part of their sham and i refused and they sent out a subpoena and said i would be
[37:21.960 --> 37:31.400]  held in contempt if i refused and so i had to take it on the lamb in uh how to switzerland but again
[37:31.400 --> 37:38.920]  you have one country you have another country i i ended up in holland um and uh i i ended up
[37:38.920 --> 37:45.720]  putting a little kid out of the canal uh that had fallen into the canal and a crowd um you know
[37:45.720 --> 37:51.400]  assembled and then the police and i i snuck out through the crowd before the police got there
[37:51.400 --> 37:57.560]  a couple of nights later uh there was a burglary in progress across the canal because i was living
[37:57.560 --> 38:04.520]  on the canal and i had my dog with me and he was back and i looked and uh call it muscle memory
[38:04.520 --> 38:11.720]  or reflex i called the police and then i went out there and they they had the um uh the guy uh
[38:11.720 --> 38:18.920]  and uh with all the booty it took off the boat and i was really impressed by the way that he uh was
[38:18.920 --> 38:24.840]  handled by the police and the next morning two detectives came to my door and escorted me to
[38:24.840 --> 38:29.960]  police headquarters and they brought me through the cells and i thought are they gonna throw me
[38:29.960 --> 38:35.400]  in the flammer but at least i thought look at this you can eat off the floor here stainless steel
[38:35.400 --> 38:41.160]  and uh it was civil not like the dungeons they have in new york and other places and then
[38:41.160 --> 38:45.480]  they didn't throw me in there they brought me upstairs to the police commissioner and the
[38:45.480 --> 38:52.120]  commissioner a gray-haired gentleman he jumped to his feet he reached out his hand and he said
[38:52.120 --> 39:00.280]  mania sir may i shake your hand and i thought what am i dreaming or something he had a copy
[39:00.280 --> 39:06.440]  of his book on my desk on his desk and i said it's always a pleasure to shake the hand of a
[39:06.440 --> 39:12.360]  police officer that wants to shake my hand uh and that's what i wrote in his book and a couple
[39:12.360 --> 39:21.720]  years ago when uh uh i was involved with um the drug wars the damage done the drug wars and uh it
[39:21.720 --> 39:29.800]  was premiering in amsterdam the police commissioner the new police commissioner came uh to introduce
[39:29.800 --> 39:41.320]  me and he said in 1974 i had to choose between becoming uh an f-16 pilot for the sports academy
[39:41.320 --> 39:48.840]  and he says and then i saw a movie called surfy coast and my mind was made up so my point is
[39:48.840 --> 39:55.880]  what we have to do we have to inspire people uh because by our deeds they're like pebbles
[39:55.880 --> 40:01.400]  that you throw into a body of water they make ripples and i never would have imagined that
[40:02.120 --> 40:10.360]  you know 30 40 years after people are still uh being inspired and and that's what the people
[40:10.360 --> 40:16.360]  need they need inspiration well like your show that you know tells people what's really going on in
[40:16.360 --> 40:24.440]  the world and um but uh you know uh i know they play with words they got their own their own
[40:24.440 --> 40:30.360]  vocabulary they say freedom isn't free you bet your asset isn't free you have to fight for it
[40:30.360 --> 40:35.480]  but not in foreign countries right here in our own country that's where they you have to fight for
[40:35.480 --> 40:42.920]  your freedom well frank serpico this is a amazing interview you are definitely on fire today we're
[40:42.920 --> 40:46.760]  going to overdrive folks we can finish the hour with them we're just going to go into the fourth
[40:46.760 --> 40:51.480]  hour with wane madson coming up if he's able to do that with he's got the inside scoop on
[40:51.480 --> 40:59.640]  fast and furious murders all of it uh former nsa uh a officer and congressional reporter uh he he
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.400]  everything he told me three or four months ago was actually about a year ago but three or four
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.880]  months ago really got clear with informants and people he had to leave the country for a while
[41:07.880 --> 41:12.520]  over all this he's going to be joining us uh dealing with it because reportedly the white house
[41:12.520 --> 41:16.520]  had a hit man out after him but once that went public they left him alone that's another issue
[41:16.520 --> 41:22.360]  just to talk about freedom not being free uh you know they killed the dc madam after she was on my
[41:22.360 --> 41:28.680]  show and they just throw these lies at everybody and when everybody starts just trying to go along
[41:28.680 --> 41:33.640]  to get along that's what allows corruption to run rampant but what frank was talking about
[41:33.640 --> 41:39.880]  all the good police he's inspired and others and and that's what you've got to do all of us doing
[41:39.880 --> 41:46.840]  little things like the pebbles in a pond but you can feel the the the evil intensifying right now
[41:46.840 --> 41:53.720]  you can see the insane corruption frank let me raise a curveball on you here because you know
[41:53.720 --> 41:59.640]  we didn't talk before you came on today uh what about 9 11 it's been used as the foundation of
[41:59.640 --> 42:05.720]  everything that we see happening that the warrant was spying that's illegal the highway checkpoints
[42:05.720 --> 42:12.360]  all over the country the tsa sticking their hands down our pants i want to ask you about that uh
[42:12.360 --> 42:17.800]  william shatner now being wrote by him uh today leaving uh lax i mean oh here's william shatner
[42:17.800 --> 42:23.480]  let's pull his pants down you know i mean he may be a terrorist this this training is all that were
[42:23.480 --> 42:28.520]  prisoners while ignoring the real criminals that are all around us but but the official story of 9
[42:28.520 --> 42:34.280]  11 uh i mean now am we're all the lucky number three in al qaeda they admit was really cia the head
[42:34.280 --> 42:41.320]  of the 7 7 bombings they admit was mi6 now they publicly use al qaeda to take over libya and now
[42:41.320 --> 42:47.160]  syria and they admit this in the news well yeah al qaeda is working for us but they're good guys
[42:47.160 --> 42:53.320]  but i've got to have tsa grope my family and william shatner's got to have him pull his pants down
[42:53.320 --> 42:57.240]  because they're going in his pants and that's what they did they they went in his pants they fell
[42:57.240 --> 43:01.720]  off it happens all the time to people make old ladies get out of wheelchairs i mean i'm ranting
[43:01.720 --> 43:07.880]  here serpa co but but this this foundation of 9 11 what's your view on that first of all you know i
[43:07.880 --> 43:14.520]  refused to fly because when i came back in the country i was stripped searched uh by the customs
[43:14.520 --> 43:21.240]  people and uh they knew everything that was going on uh in my life with the police which was supposed
[43:21.240 --> 43:30.040]  to be secret so but i have to say one thing that the thing is that it's the hierarchy that forces
[43:30.040 --> 43:36.440]  these men to do it like their quotas and these guys as they said to me you know frank i mean it
[43:36.440 --> 43:41.640]  might be rationalizing but they say you know we got our jobs are home we have to pay the
[43:41.640 --> 43:48.680]  mortgage so they are the victims uh but they just have to be strong enough but how you're
[43:48.680 --> 43:54.680]  going to do it when they hardly act over you i wrote an article about 9 11 for a chronogram
[43:54.680 --> 44:00.760]  chronogram magazine way back when i don't remember all the names and stuff now but about the iron
[44:00.760 --> 44:09.480]  triangle and that the night before 9 11 you know uh bin laden's uh i think it was his brother and
[44:09.480 --> 44:17.400]  all these heads of state had this meeting at uh i forget what which hotel it was here it was the
[44:17.400 --> 44:23.320]  ritz carlton ritz carlton yeah you know that was in the london guardian right yeah the bush and all
[44:23.320 --> 44:27.560]  the bin laden's and then only they were allowed to leave the country on the day of 9 11 when all
[44:27.560 --> 44:34.040]  the air traffic was shut down that's confirmed yes yeah so wasn't that a coincidence yeah yeah
[44:34.040 --> 44:40.440]  now i mean they blew it sky high yeah it's it's it's a fact and then uh there's uh other character
[44:41.560 --> 44:48.840]  juliani uh rudy juliani you know there's it you know there's still his hope for democracy in america
[44:48.840 --> 44:55.640]  i gotta say that because there's this street artist and his name is um no relation to the show host
[44:55.640 --> 45:03.640]  it's not let i think it's gave uh something Robert let him in or something but anyway he
[45:03.640 --> 45:09.720]  was a street artist and he would make um the paintings of juliani and he would cry them
[45:09.720 --> 45:17.640]  eight off juliani with a mustache and uh things like that juliani the mayor of new york had him
[45:17.640 --> 45:27.000]  arrested 41 times and this street artist managed to beat him every time so there are some good
[45:27.000 --> 45:34.520]  judges out there and they have to inspire the others we have to you know uh there was a quote
[45:34.520 --> 45:43.480]  i was looking for here from from sissileo you know about the diligence the um um you're talking about
[45:43.480 --> 45:48.040]  the heights of the roman empire you were building it up and we had to go to break right right um
[45:48.040 --> 45:58.600]  um but there's the i lost i lost the um the the uh the the uh quote but in the end he says
[45:58.600 --> 46:04.920]  and who shall say we are worthy of mayor so you know you can't blame nobody if you sit on your
[46:04.920 --> 46:11.880]  lounge and uh and you don't do uh don't do anything about it um so the people you know
[46:11.880 --> 46:19.240]  their strength in numbers he says the liberty is established by law we must be vigilant
[46:19.880 --> 46:29.160]  the liberty to enslave us is always present under that very liberty how constitution speaks
[46:29.160 --> 46:37.000]  of the general welfare of the people under that phrase all sorts of excesses can be employed
[46:37.000 --> 46:48.280]  by lasting tyrants to make us bondsmen so that doesn't say at all um you know i i don't know
[46:48.280 --> 46:56.680]  what does you know and um so uh anyway and of course this will really help promote the idea
[46:56.680 --> 47:03.560]  i don't know how much time we have but it's uh always a pleasure talking to you and uh and uh
[47:03.560 --> 47:11.560]  visiting your website uh about our our great pope and all the work he did and uh you know
[47:11.560 --> 47:17.640]  that's that's the opiate of the masses uh you know as i said before you know the pope the queen uh
[47:18.200 --> 47:27.400]  you know these rock stars the uh they had the the labels inside your your clothes you know it's
[47:27.400 --> 47:36.120]  um the corporations that uh make plans out of the public and um you know telling you uh
[47:36.680 --> 47:43.960]  then you then you see these guys uh these uh uh television guys are on public television and uh
[47:44.520 --> 47:49.240]  with a brand new suit every time and and the commissioner too in new york city
[47:49.240 --> 47:54.760]  thousand dollar suit hundred dollar ties you know they're setting a good example for
[47:54.760 --> 48:02.120]  um uh you know tightening your belt what do you think about eric holder from my research he was
[48:02.120 --> 48:07.480]  intimately involved in Oklahoma city and in the cover-up and it's in federal court it was even in
[48:07.480 --> 48:13.800]  the chicago tribune and el paso times that the drug cartels sinola got caught with five tons
[48:14.440 --> 48:19.960]  they're in court and the feds come in and go yeah it's national security we authorized them to
[48:19.960 --> 48:24.280]  bring the drugs in and then it happened with a bunch of other cartels and then we found out
[48:24.280 --> 48:30.840]  that they're giving guns to gangs all over the u.s but also overseas i mean it's just they are
[48:30.840 --> 48:40.520]  nothing but total gangsters you're talking about the government is uh is exactly the the thing is
[48:42.440 --> 48:49.800]  um um we never would even probably heard about uh what happened in mexico that wasn't for the
[48:49.800 --> 48:59.400]  killing of the uh federal agent you know they say nothing of the 200 other uh mexicans that were
[48:59.400 --> 49:08.120]  flooded uh so you know body count doesn't mean anything to uh to people that are running the
[49:08.120 --> 49:17.720]  show you know it's collateral damage uh and um so that's why uh you know uh the NAACP says here
[49:17.720 --> 49:26.280]  in their letter uh to however it says um the NAAC supports accountability and transparency at every
[49:26.280 --> 49:34.280]  level fine but they say however this crusade in congress reeks of partisan politics well i want
[49:34.280 --> 49:40.600]  to say what does this letter wreak up you know and so everybody's using words this cronyism and uh
[49:40.600 --> 49:47.880]  um i i say let the chips fall where they may and and what we find as i said before is just uh
[49:48.920 --> 49:53.560]  the tip of the dung heap no you're right justice be done may the heavens fall i found a cicero
[49:54.200 --> 50:01.480]  uh quote from bc here it says when a government becomes powerful period it is a usurper which
[50:01.480 --> 50:09.160]  takes bread from the innocent mouths and deprives honorable men of their substance for votes with
[50:09.160 --> 50:15.320]  which to perpetuate itself and because the romans did the same thing with citizens they would go buy
[50:15.320 --> 50:21.960]  votes they would take it with welfare taxes and then go to the welfare citizens on the dole and use
[50:21.960 --> 50:28.680]  them to outvote me other people that produced i mean this stuff's been going on forever yep well
[50:28.680 --> 50:35.400]  now with the uh with the internet and stuff maybe people can you know inform each other better
[50:35.400 --> 50:41.000]  you know the other day i went on and i saw something about kissinger um and i don't know if

[54:22.440 --> 54:28.120]  talking to dean mellow jake quince and others that have been patiently holding dean listing on xm
[54:28.120 --> 54:33.480]  166 we're going to him first had about four or five minutes left with frank serpica what a legend
[54:33.480 --> 54:38.360]  like he said we've got to inspire other people and he gave the examples of how he inspired people
[54:38.360 --> 54:44.360]  and never knew he was doing it i know he certainly inspired me i was growing up as a child i'm only
[54:44.360 --> 54:52.680]  38 i was probably like 12 years old or something my dad uh you know we went and rented serpica and
[54:52.680 --> 54:58.360]  popped it in the vcr or it was on i don't know hbo or something i don't remember i don't think we
[54:58.360 --> 55:02.360]  had cable when i was 12 the point is i remember being a little kid with my dad watching it my
[55:02.360 --> 55:07.720]  dad going this is a true story and then i started noticing a few years later that the police were
[55:07.720 --> 55:13.560]  dealing drugs where i lived outside dallas and then still pulling people over and harassing them and i'd
[55:13.560 --> 55:19.240]  be like you deal drugs what are you doing asking if i have drugs i don't use drugs i'll kill you kids
[55:19.240 --> 55:24.520]  you're going to jail you know drag me out of the car where i was riding to school with older kids and
[55:24.520 --> 55:30.360]  take me to jail and and they told my dad through uh our lawyer because he got contacted and they said
[55:30.360 --> 55:35.880]  we're going to kill your son if he doesn't shut up but then later the sheriff got busted shipping
[55:35.880 --> 55:42.440]  cocaine in by the fbi who are a bunch of drug dealers too at the top frank briefly you wanted to
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.640]  make some comments uh i forget about what we were talking during the break what was about kissinger
[55:47.640 --> 55:53.880]  oh yeah kissinger go ahead i mean it's just a classic example how these um you know terrible
[55:53.880 --> 56:01.160]  people are held up by our government uh as the good people you know as examples and uh the other
[56:01.160 --> 56:09.960]  day uh i i don't know how old it was on the internet uh some journalists claimed he saw kissinger being
[56:09.960 --> 56:16.360]  groped you know and uh no no no kissinger admitted that happened at the airport yeah yeah well the
[56:16.360 --> 56:22.600]  thing is i was saying well they had a right to uh maybe uh he did have a weapon of mass destruction
[56:22.600 --> 56:29.560]  on him you know because he is a terrorist but anyway when i went to see the blog i i was um
[56:30.280 --> 56:35.800]  pleased to see all the comments that the people were making back and forth you know the people
[56:35.800 --> 56:42.920]  know that he was a uh a war criminal you know and one said winning the novel prize is not hard when
[56:42.920 --> 56:49.960]  you are one of the founding thought members of the build apart the Zion club you know and you
[56:49.960 --> 56:55.720]  know comments like that so people are aware you know they're not asleep and i'm saying this is all
[56:56.360 --> 57:03.240]  due to the internet where people can uh you know reach millions of people around the world
[57:03.240 --> 57:09.960]  anyway in the words of james madison he said no nation could preserve its freedom in the
[57:09.960 --> 57:18.840]  midst of continual warfare and that's where we're in now continual warfare and um and uh how much
[57:18.840 --> 57:25.480]  time do we have because i'd like to close with the words of uh lewis d brandy's uh who was a
[57:25.480 --> 57:33.880]  specular humanist and uh i think uh wasn't he also in the court um lewis d brandy's sure go
[57:33.880 --> 57:40.200]  ahead we got about a minute he says we can have democracy in this country or we can have great
[57:40.200 --> 57:50.760]  wealth in the hands of a few but we can't have both well well frank serbakov frank serbakov thanks

[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:55.000]  say bombshell it's bombshell let's go ahead and talk to brian who's a tsa worker i guess current
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:02.600]  or former i let us know thank you for calling in well tell us i mean the whistleblower we had
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.880]  yesterday said that he's involved in hiring and they they now this is a new policy they want
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:13.000]  criminals have you heard anything like this i've heard a lot of things like that but i just want
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.200]  to vouch for what the last caller said i totally agree with that but also a lot of my fellow workers
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.560]  they also like going to sound sick but they also play games like let's see how much we can get away
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.320]  with you know what i mean like how much can we touch i don't i don't do that but i heard a lot
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:33.320]  of other workers basically playing those sick games and it's very very sick why would someone
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.920]  want to spill somebody's uh dead grandpas ashes on the ground and then laugh at them i mean i just
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:46.840]  don't understand that you know people are sick this country is going to crap and like i said
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:53.320]  tsa just hires the most disgusting most evil people they can buy you just hit the nail on the head
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:00.600]  that it's not just the police or the tsa or any of this as a culture it's getting very sick now now
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:07.480]  have you heard anything about hiring criminals um i don't know anything specifically but i do know
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:13.560]  like a lot of people i talk to you do have criminal background and also um a lot of like for instance
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.800]  a lot of slips that are placed in the bag saying that the tsa checks your bag and if something's
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.840]  missing they're deliberately going and taking these items taking these you know personal belongings
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:28.520]  you know because i guess it's kind of a game to them well we've seen that where they either
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.160]  leave marijuana in and say enjoy your weed or they take stuff they stole a baby rattle or our
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:38.920]  teething ring jfk was for my daughter in a little box they unwrapped it stole it didn't like the other
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:44.120]  rattle left it thought that i mean just just and that was like six years ago seven years ago
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:51.160]  what else can you tell us so so you're saying you work in an airport with tsa currently your
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:55.480]  tsa to be clear and there are people bragging that they have criminal records that work there
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:07.080]  yes what type of criminal records um robbery um best um i don't know of any people personally that
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:13.240]  have uh i guess you know child abuse or anything like in that kind of nature but a lot of them
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.920]  just by talking to them you give the tell that they are pretty much criminals well i mean that's
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:23.640]  that's what criminals do they they brag that hey i've been in jail hey i've done this hey i've done
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.360]  that uh so you're saying you'll be what's sitting around give us an example like sitting around the
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.800]  break room and they talk about how they're you know convicted robbers or what do they say pretty
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:38.440]  much stuff like that and like it's disgusting i'm telling you the games that they they like to play
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:44.520]  let's see let's see how far we can touch this person with before they complain let's see um how
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:51.560]  far we can go with this little kid you know like just completely disgusting evil demonic
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.160]  you name is well that's what the whistleblower said yesterday he said now they're outside the
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.400]  checkpoint there was a mother with two kids and he goes watch this i'm going to go mess with her
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.680]  and went to search her belongings what about good-looking women i have seen what you'd call a
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:13.880]  hottie over and over again i go watch this are there people that like to pull hotties out oh most
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:19.320]  definitely but you also be surprised that the people that actually don't specifically go for the
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:25.320]  hottie they'd rather go for the old age they'd rather go for the child for you know they would
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:30.920]  rather you would think that they'd go for the hottie but they wouldn't see that's it see i mean
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:36.200]  i attractive women are very beautiful obviously but i couldn't imagine wanting to make them let
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:42.840]  me put my hands on them that that's the it just sends shivers up my spine but i guess i'm not a
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:48.440]  sicko uh thank you so much for your courage sir calling in we're gonna have more tsa tell all

[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.320]  demo cribs and re blublicans and i've got a few news clips we're going to play later where he's on
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:57.560]  cnn msnbc you name it and they're like how dare you uh you know call them gang members in the
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.960]  parties or how dare you imply 9 11 could be something than what we were told we're going to get his
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:08.280]  take on some of that because it's admitted that the west is using al-qaeda in libya and syria
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:13.880]  overthrow the governments i mean that's even in london telegraph la times i showed it to you last
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.240]  hour you're a radio listener i stream video at prison planet dot tv but i read the headlines on
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:27.960]  air this is so crazy that this is going on now jesse ventura has had a big battle with the tsa as
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.520]  you know but they won't even give him his day in court we also want to get an update we haven't
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.040]  talked to him in two weeks about where's the tv show that was finished four or five months ago
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.880]  uh and also i have confirmed from program directors and you've heard them here on this show
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.760]  radio stations we're on and that eric mancal muller's on because we're on a lot of the same
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:52.120]  stations for whatever reason like the big eight ten out in orlando they haven't had the problem
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:57.000]  though other stations have where when jesse ventura's on and talking about the censorship of his
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.280]  episode or fema camps there's a scrambling that happens now we don't know if it's at the satellite
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.640]  uh the radio satellite i'm on a similar one to mancal but a different one or we don't know if
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:14.520]  it's the eas that's wired in at the hub point by law now at the radio station transmitter
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.080]  and i've talked to engineers they say yeah they could send a radio control
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:26.120]  and scramble it and now obama has announced this is in reuters ap yesterday that they're going to
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:33.000]  have eas break in with and take over your cell phone with presidential announcements and then
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.040]  and then your phone's going to have it the uh the the presidential ring and then it will override
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:43.400]  whatever call you're on same thing with tv cable everything so let's talk about the censorship of
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:48.440]  the uh police state episode what's happening with the new episode i know he was on mancal
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:53.960]  talking about this we investigated it and interviewed program directors on air and off air
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.680]  and let me tell you it's freaking them out so jessie that was confirmed uh what's your take on that
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.760]  oh you know first of all uh it won't affect me with the cell phone alex i've never owned one
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:10.280]  person like ever so i'm going to plead ignorant on that i unfortunately i won't hear the president's
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:15.880]  messages because i don't use the cell phone so i guess i'll have to get him some other way or you
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:22.760]  can tell me about them but uh no i think it's very dangerous what's going on between that and these
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:28.440]  that they now allow these unmanned drones these surveillance drones are being okay to fly throughout
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:35.960]  our country uh you know it's uh i hate to say it but our bill of rights as i state my book is in
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:41.800]  shambles i mean we've got government that just ignores that they don't care we don't have habeas
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:48.440]  corpus anymore that's been suspended since george bush started his folly in the wars obama's never
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:54.440]  reinstated it so you don't even have a right to a lawyer anymore in this country and i don't know
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:59.320]  when people here are going to wake up and realize that the democrats and republicans don't have your
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:05.000]  best interest in mind well i agree with you let me give you the headline because the guys were able
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.240]  to actually pull it up so you can read it and so and it has a link to the white house announcement
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:15.560]  and so uh radio listeners can also find it uh the headline up at info wars dot com from that
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:23.000]  article uh states and we'll throw that back up on screen here real quick dhs cell phone alert system
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.160]  follows you around presidential message to have their own distinctive ringtone and it's a we have
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:35.080]  links to the white house announcement and the department of homeland security statement
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:42.760]  and get this governor walmarts are phasing in telescreens with big sys on them telling you
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:49.400]  to look out for terrorists well i guess they're going to inform us well alex uh isn't that a
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.720]  wonderful public service they're doing for all of us weren't you in a movie with arnold
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.960]  schwarzzenegger where they have billboards saying watch your neighbors is called the running man
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:03.080]  yeah yeah we the running man is becoming quite prophetic we don't quite have a game show like
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.400]  it because he's always based on a game show and actually the running man for many people that
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:12.040]  don't realize that it was it was written by a gentleman named richard bachman bill that was
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:18.520]  a pseudonym for steven king steven king wrote a group of short stories the running man included
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:24.680]  under that name but died originated from steven king so if anybody would know about bizarre
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:30.600]  things and have a bizarre imagination it would be steven king but uh he's like a prophet because
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:36.680]  a lot of the things that he writes about and uh him and george orwell are now coming true today
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:42.200]  and uh you know again we haven't quite got to the point where we have the running man game show but
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:49.160]  we were to the point where reality tv is pretty getting pretty darn close to it well we have uh
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:54.040]  all the gun camera footage of people being killed in iraq and places and in the video games
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:58.920]  simulate killing so i think in a way they've turned war into a game show i've talked to business owners
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:06.840]  oh there's no doubt about it alex there you know i i feel for kids today because kids to play these
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.880]  games and all these things that just he advertised on tv you know with the with the killing and all
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:16.280]  that stuff it's it's going to call us them towards it they're going to think it's uh
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:22.200]  everyday activity in the normal way of life and and uh i don't think that's necessarily good idea
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:30.760]  one thing that's always amazed me alex is how sex is rated x but violence is only r oh yeah you can
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:35.400]  have two boxers beat the daylights out of each other and that's family fun but you see a woman's
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:42.120]  breath at the end of the world yeah i mean it's just amazing how how really strange we are as a
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:49.400]  society that sex could be x-rated that's worse than uh running around with the texas chainsaw
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:56.760]  massacre and movies like that that you know mass murderers and you know people being killed left
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:06.120]  flash or movies all that stuff those only get an r rating but sex gets an x-rated very very well
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.240]  said i totally agree with you on that point well i mean they admit we're being desensitized to all
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.880]  this speaking of censorship i know that you we're not supposed to get into the whole story because
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:20.600]  some of that's private but people always ask me about this uh here we are over a year later
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.320]  and they censored that homeland security fema special where you blew the camps wide open
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:31.800]  now uh they're doing urban warfare drills the army admits they've got the camps uh i know you've
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.640]  been out of pocket but i can send you that if you'd like sure we were sent an army document a few
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:40.200]  months ago the army came out and said you shouldn't have that but yes we have reeducation camps
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:47.080]  uh so so much of this is coming out in the open now and uh so recap for folks what happened
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.800]  with that episode and now what's happened with the new season well what happened with that
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:58.040]  particular episode was are we i believe it was are we turning into a police statement of course
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.720]  we discovered the documents uh congressman cone of tennessee was one of the co-sponsors of it
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:10.600]  and uh we found the documents with uh where homeland security ordered fema to build no less
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:17.560]  than six detention camps and of course the cover story is it's for a disasters like Katrina so
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:23.320]  that they will have places they're located in six different locations throughout the country and
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:28.680]  that if there's a big disaster that hits what they tell you is that it'll be good then because
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:35.080]  we'll have places to put the for lack of better term refugees from the disasters until they could
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:41.240]  find you know living quarters other places or whatever but uh you know uh how can they be
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:46.280]  refugee camps when they build them with fences with barbed wire on i mean if they're just simply
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.240]  holding you there is a temporary thing due to a disaster well then why would they need things
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:56.120]  of that order why you shouldn't be able to come and go as you please and the thing to always look
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:01.960]  at for people the novice way to look at it is always look at the barbed wire on the top of the fence
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:09.240]  if the barbed wire faces outward it's to keep people from the outside getting in if barbed
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:15.800]  wire faces inward it's to keep people from the inside getting out so that's one easy way when
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:21.720]  you ever see a barbed wire or a chain link fence with barbed wire on the top look at the way the
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:27.880]  barbed wire is facing if it's facing in it's to keep prisoners in there if it's facing out then
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:34.120]  it's to keep outsiders from getting in also if it's coiled on the top it's a detention center
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:39.000]  in many cases as well oh yeah but if it's razor wire absolutely i mean that's a whole different
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.840]  ballgame that's another that's another cup of tea with that stuff that razor wire will stop anybody
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:50.360]  from any direction well i've talked to program directors who've confirmed here on air that when
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:54.600]  you go that when you went on man cal or that when i go on his show and now i've confirmed it's happened
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:18:00.600]  to my show some that they scramble it when we give bill numbers and you know talk about things like
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.800]  emergency centers establishment act what do you think's happening there well man i've done this
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:12.120]  show twice now on this book tour and he's informed me he's outraged he's going crazy over it i appreciate
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:17.160]  man call a little bit because you know he was the one who at first didn't believe that waterboarding
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:24.040]  was torture but like a good journalist he had it done to himself and now he's completely reversed
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:29.720]  himself he realizes that it is torture because he had it done to himself you know when they administered
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.720]  the waterboarding to him and you know it's bad because you've had it done to you yeah back in
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:38.360]  sears school we all essentially did many years ago so and they used to call it chinese water
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:43.560]  torture but they got a way of changing the names then it became waterboarding and now thanks to Dick
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:49.160]  cheney it's called enhanced interrogation but getting back to the show uh that's what we learned
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:55.080]  in the course when we confronted congressman tone with that he actually read on the congressional
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:01.240]  floor uh an outrage statement against me uh michael braverman and my television show so
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:06.200]  we actually went into the congressional record on it but on on that particular show but the
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:13.080]  the weird thing about it was it aired one time and then it was taken off the air and now two tv
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:18.200]  won't even acknowledge we did the show it's out there on youtube i would guess it's still there
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:25.080]  you got a search and i also erased it off the dvr's governor okay well that's news to me too so uh
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.200]  you know obviously they don't want any of this out there for the public consumption or public
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:36.200]  comment or knowledge on it and as far as the show goes this year it's interesting because you were
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.920]  just talking about tsa and all that hold on governor stay there stay there we've got to go

[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:33.080]  all right governor Jesse Ventura is our guest uh gov you were getting into the tv show for folks
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:38.760]  that just joined us you were i was saying where's the tv show uh the third installment uh i know
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:43.240]  it got into the tsa it was supposed to be here four or five months ago uh where is it you said
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:48.840]  that's interesting alex and then we went to break okay well it is interesting because we finish the
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.720]  shows right on time like we normally do in november and usually the editing takes place
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:59.960]  immediately and we're on the air sometime in either mid january or early february but uh
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:06.040]  here we are approaching july and the shows have not aired and of course one of the shows we focused
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:12.760]  on this year was the t the tsa you know and and uh and one of the things we learned is that they're
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:18.440]  going to come out with these wristbands that will what they're going to sell to the public is they
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:23.880]  will have all your information and you know so you'll be banned at much like a dog collar only
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:28.360]  it'll be around your wrist and therefore you can stick the wristband in something and they'll
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:34.280]  know exactly who you are which seems on the surface like maybe a good thing but underneath
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:40.600]  what we also learned is they can decompacitate you with these much like a uh like a late uh
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.720]  taser where if they want to drop you in the airport they'll out with you wearing one of these
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:54.280]  they will have the ability to do that to you wow yeah we learned that on the show that these
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:00.440]  things also double for security devices i said to wear like they'll say if you're causing trouble
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:06.520]  or you we suspect you of being you know having uh bad purposes at the airport that they can just
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.320]  literally drop you like a taser with them if you're wearing them so that'll be more stuff the
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:18.120]  lemmings i'm sure will love to get and they'll wear them faithfully well no i saw homeland security
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:23.320]  a few years ago they had a meeting and listened to a proposal to make everyone wear security
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:28.120]  bracelets and they added oh by the way as an afterthought they have a taser function in them
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:33.320]  and homeland security was actually pushing it so you're saying you were doing an episode researching
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:38.920]  that yeah yeah that's that's what's in the episode on the tsa where we exposed that whole thing
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:46.040]  that if you do put these they'll require them at the airports and uh that way allegedly you won't
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.920]  have to go through the body searches you won't have to go through the x-ray machine if it properly
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:57.720]  identifies you but on the flip side it can also be used to be to be compact well to you know drop
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:09.080]  you down you know and get you under control if they have any need to do that oh wow i'm glad i'm
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:14.280]  not flying anymore you know i made the choice when they wouldn't allow me to go to court over my
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.640]  fourth amendment constitutional rights saying they didn't have jurisdiction i just followed
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.520]  what janet napolitano said you know the head of the gestapo that's why i like to call homeland
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:30.360]  security uh she said if you don't like it don't fly so i don't like it so i'm not flying
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:39.720]  governor i mean if it's already this bad today how much worse is it going to get
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.200]  i don't know alex you know and i i said this on another interview i said you know this right
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:51.880]  now is the first time in my life where i can say this all the rest of my life no matter how bad
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:57.240]  today is in the united states i always had the feeling that tomorrow would be a better day this
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:03.080]  is the first time in my life that if it's bad today i actually looked at tomorrow could now be worse
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.280]  you know i mean we're getting an assault on the middle class that's unbelievable
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:15.560]  you know and people and assault on unions now granted unions can be overreach their bounds
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:21.720]  they can be you know bad because they're run by people but for the most part unions are
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:28.120]  what created the middle class and if you look at a chart that shows median wage and if you look at
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:36.360]  the same chart that shows that union uh falling that the lines are identical as unions fail so does
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:43.400]  median income and they fail identically people need to understand it was unions that gave us
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:48.840]  things like collective bargaining it gave you things to be able to get health insurance at work
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:54.760]  it gave you things against the employers that you wouldn't have as an individual case and point
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:29:00.360]  i did the fran target and show and he was railing pretty hard on the unions then i bought a fran
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:07.240]  remember something you and the nfl had a union or still have one i said in pro wrestling we have
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:15.160]  never had one that's why at one point in my career i wrestled 63 consecutive nights in a row
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:23.240]  without a day off 63 days in a row i never had health insurance this was back in the early 80s
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:30.360]  i was paying $5,000 a year to ensure my family my wife and my kids or if we would have had a union
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:36.520]  i would have probably only had to pay $1,500 a year because there's strengths and numbers and also
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:43.960]  you know in pro wrestling where in pro football pro baseball all the sports that have unions they
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:53.720]  have retirement stay there jessie we're on the march coast to coast direct from austin

[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.040]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:29.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous

[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:22.440]  we're gonna open the phones up here in about 10 15 minutes for a quick comment or question for
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:33.240]  governor ventura 800-259-9231 800-2599-231 you got cut off by that break there governor finishing your
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:38.760]  point about unions yeah you'll see a lot of football players others are making five million
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:43.000]  dollars a year they'll they'll be real quote conservative criticizing unions but they sure
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.480]  like their union i don't like mainline unions because they're anti-gun pro-new world order
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:53.320]  uh you know they've been taken over as well but certainly there's no checks and balances
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:58.360]  to the big mega corporate unions these cartels that come in and buy off our governments
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:04.040]  out of allen going back to wrestling for a moment the other thing is in pro wrestling
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:10.840]  because there's not a union there's no retirement so you could wrestle 25 years and let's face it
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:15.960]  wrestlers are not accountants they're not you know specialists to know how to invest and
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:21.480]  take care of their futures all the time they're professional wrestlers and you can put 25 years
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:26.600]  in the business and when you're done you get nothing not a thing because there's no union
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:33.480]  protection at all in pro wrestling well there's not you know i've got a lot of questions here
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:38.520]  that i want to raise governor but uh what is front and center on your plate right now
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:44.280]  what's your greatest concern uh what's stuck in your craw well what i'm most concerned about
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:50.040]  is our loss of freedom you know the bill of rights to me has been in our constitution is
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:56.040]  in shambles the very cloth of our nation that we're supposed to abide by i mean in chapter two
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:01.640]  of my book you know i have quotes remarkable quotes from george washington especially the father
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:07.880]  of our country talking about how political parties how awful they are and thomas jefferson
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:14.040]  and john adams too and what troubles me the most is we're not a country that doesn't seem to want
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:19.400]  to read history and of course the old cliche is true if you don't read history you're destined to
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:25.880]  repeat it and uh we're we're heading right down that road because people are more interested in
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:33.240]  in uh you know these these phony reality shows on tv they're more interested in uh you know sports
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:37.480]  happening throughout the world which don't get me wrong that's great entertainment and you need
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:43.000]  to entertain yourself we all work hard and you know you owe yourself some entertainment but
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.920]  you also owe yourself to pay attention and pay attention to what's going on around you and what
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:55.240]  bothers me most is most people have this lazy fair attitude well it isn't going to happen to me
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:00.920]  and until it does come up and happen to them they're not taking any precautions they're not paying
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:07.480]  attention to government and uh people are not voting and right now voting and voting against
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:13.720]  democrats and republicans to me has to be the number one order for this fall i can't emphasize
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:20.680]  it enough stop voting for these two brought out bribe political parties in fact they used to always
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:26.440]  say if you voted for me jessie venturn minnesota you were wasting your vote because i couldn't win
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:32.360]  well i did win and we also wanted demand that governor dairy johnson the libertarian candidate
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:38.840]  per president be included in the debates this fall why do we only get two leaders of the two
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:44.440]  gangs who get the debate let's bring in a neutral person like governor johnson and see what he has
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:49.800]  to say and then if you still want to vote democrat and republican well at least you've given you've
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:56.200]  been given a third option to consider well you're right and and even if you don't agree with johnson
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:03.480]  on every issue the point is it's about forcing the two-party monopoly the two twins to let in
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:10.920]  another voice which is something they desperately don't want because let me add something no one's
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:16.440]  ever going to agree with the candidate a hundred percent you're never going to see a candidate
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:22.280]  for public office where you can honestly say you know i agree with everything he says take ron paul
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:27.960]  and i you know i i think ron paul would have been the best president with without any doubt
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:35.400]  and yet we differ on the abortion issue ron paul does not support abortion at all i do i i don't
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:41.480]  necessarily support people having abortion but i don't support government telling women what they
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.960]  tend or can't do with their bodies yeah well ron paul comes out and basically says it's become a
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:51.320]  state issue and people are attacking rand paul right now because he's saying hey don't have
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:57.320]  mandatory federal labeling for gmo but he's saying the feds don't have that jurisdiction
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:02.360]  it should be a state issue and that's a complex issue but i understand why he's saying that
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:07.480]  sure well i'll tell you i just got a communication from rand paul and let me tell you this alex i
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:13.320]  don't know if you're aware of this one you probably are usually more aware than i am but i got a
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:19.400]  thing from rand paul are you aware of this treaty in the um that they're going to try to get us to
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:25.000]  sign on to uh which one they've got an anti it's going to happen this fall and it's one that we'll
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.720]  call but that will have an international gun registry oh yeah yeah sure sure no no there's
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:35.000]  the treaty that hillary says they're going to sign without congress and uh register and restrict
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.720]  small arms the unidiret treaty yeah and then there's also the law the c treaty uh that hands
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:45.080]  over everything to the un yeah speak to that governor where do you stand on un law uh restricting
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:50.840]  our guns well that's absurd i mean we have the second amendment which is to protect our right
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:57.320]  to individuals to have firearms it's not there people need to understand they try to sell you
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:02.520]  well we're not going to inflict on your hunting and fishing this has nothing to do with hunting
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:07.000]  and fishing back when they wrote the bill of rights if you didn't hunt and fish you didn't need
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:14.040]  so this was done so that the public could arm themselves in case government became oppressive
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:19.640]  well that's going to happen with this deal is we will now throw our second amendment out the window
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:25.320]  we will then fall under an international arms law that will tell you that will require you to
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:31.400]  register all your guns internationally with some international unit who eventually you know is going
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:36.600]  to disarm you and you know that's the liberal side of the issue that's their thing that's like
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:43.400]  bill maron tv is for that and i go around that you know how ridiculous is that because i was in the
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:49.960]  philippines the day ferdan and marcos declared marshal lawn became a dictator the first thing he
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:56.520]  did as a dictator he gave the philippine people two weeks to turn in all their guns or it was the
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:04.360]  death sentence now why would a dictator make that his top priority it's obvious why so the public
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:09.960]  has no way to rise up against him that's right governor and i'm very glad that you're here
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:17.400]  speaking about it here's our article june 16th info wars dot com obama seeks un and us congressional
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:24.440]  ratification of un global gun control treaty and then it has links to the un in our article
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:30.760]  where they're actually calling for it at the united nations un dot org disarmament
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:38.280]  forward slash c o v arms forward slash arms trade treaty registration restriction and in
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:46.280]  the un treaty they state civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:51.720]  of the state so so they're admitting they want a power monopoly what you just said i say that's
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:56.200]  illegitimate and i tell you if they want to cause a civil war governor what do you think's
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:01.560]  going to happen look at it look at it this way alex i'll give you the best example i live in
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:08.680]  mexico five months out of the year in mexico private ownership of guns is illegal and look
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:16.360]  what's going on down there 20 to 30 000 people a year are killed by the drug cartels because
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:23.640]  the regular people down there have no mechanism to defend themselves and so all these guns
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:29.800]  advocates that wanted disarm us take a look at the country of mexico as i said they have big
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:37.080]  signs when you drive into mexico firearms and even ammunition are illegal if you're caught with them
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:43.640]  you will go immediately to mexican prison and and look at the end results it's the old cliche
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:49.000]  when the honest people don't have guns only the bad people do because they're not getting theirs
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.640]  legally anyway so they're going to have guns if they don't care one way or the other the criminals
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.840]  and that's exactly what would happen up here the only people then that would have firearms
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:06.040]  would be criminals i'm on the un treaty website where they said they want the abolition of all
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:11.080]  of our guns and it says strengthening peace and security through disarmament but then only the
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:17.240]  un who by the way is invading countless countries as we speak has the guns imagine what hitler would
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:21.880]  have done if the rest of the world had been disarmed yeah well you know a little bit i mean
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:27.480]  we still had our militaries naturally that brought him you know wasn't the civilian people necessarily
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:32.040]  now it's a global government now it's a global government yeah but you're talking about a global
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:38.120]  government here how then do we rise up if we don't like the global government you know i guess
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:45.320]  you know we can uh get a bunch of slingshots or something stand up for them governor jesse
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:50.520]  ventures with us uh his book is already going up the best seller charts democrats and republicans
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:54.200]  get it out to everybody out there that you know who's not awake to what's happening
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:59.400]  a lot of founding father quotes a lot of great insight available info warshop.com and bookstores
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:03.640]  everywhere but speaking of global government since we just raised that point you were on the
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:07.880]  kudlow report last week and they i'm not going to play the whole clip because we don't have time
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:13.560]  i want to go to calls but they savaged you for daring to say there's some holes in the official
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:19.160]  911 story to say the least but let's stop there here's the same report i thought there was no
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:23.720]  global government i thought the big banks like in your tv show last year where you expose run the
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:29.560]  global government i thought that was all made up governor here is cnbc talking about the global
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:37.000]  government two days ago so mostly what they do is hold summits i think that right now the question
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.040]  is do we all work for central bankers that's what i want to address to our guests tonight
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:48.840]  is this global governance at last is it one world the central bankers in charge jim jimiorio you say
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:54.600]  we've got some downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just living and dying
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.800]  for what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke put
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:05.560]  put and that we won't go any lower than say five percent down from here of course we are because
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:10.360]  if we look at the economic data there's nothing to get excited about in that so we you know yesterday
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:15.160]  we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke fed to expand their balance sheets and pump more money in
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:20.360]  but the stock market knows that reluctance is is totally different than not willing to do it at all
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:26.040]  and that's why we saw oil and oil implode and gold trade off heavily because they're not a protected
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:30.600]  class if the stock market starts trading off in the 10 to 15 to 20 percent area the chairman's
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.600]  going to come in and throw some stimulus at it so to answer your question we are absolutely
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:38.760]  slaves to central banks because we'd love to be slaves of the economy but the economic numbers
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:43.160]  continue to do nothing but let's stop there they go on to basically thank the federal reserve the
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.960]  full clips at info wars.com they go on to basically thank the federal reserve and say well they're
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:52.040]  just trying to fix things we'd like a market but everything's run by them they're the main
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:57.320]  recipients of the trillions in bailout they sold the derivatives in europe 90 plus percent of the
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:03.640]  debt is theirs but the media acts like it's the public as they raise taxes cut benefits further
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:09.240]  stalling the economy governor there were literally in the last few weeks more than 30 articles in
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:16.760]  mainstream news admitting an authoritarian world governments here run by banks but they know best
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:21.480]  and thank god they're there why do you think they're coming out in the open now well because
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:27.720]  eventually the truth will come out alex you know you can't keep things hidden forever so they want
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:33.400]  to get ahead of the eight bad they want to put the spin on it so that all the lemmings in the country
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:39.640]  will be comfortable with it when when it actually does come a clear cut reality out there that's why
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:44.920]  they're doing it it's very intelligent to do it that way if it's going to happen they want to be
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:51.000]  ahead of the curve on it so that they can put their spin on it first and that way anyone else that
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:57.480]  that opposes it will be fighting up your battle exactly because people only remember the first
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:01.480]  time they heard it reported and how it was reported they don't remember later like the
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:06.680]  official story of 9-11 we're told this is the official story that's it go back to sleep but
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:12.200]  when you actually look closer it's got more holes than at the swiss cheese on the same show they
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:17.000]  tried to imply that you were bad and that you were saying you know like like the americans did it
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:23.400]  instead of the globalist what's your take on that well again you know you're anyone that questions
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:30.360]  9-11 in this country to mainstream media is considered a nutcase how dare you do it you're
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:37.880]  unpatriotic and you know they offer us no information they accept a 9-11 report that
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:44.280]  had to be i learned this everything in the 9-11 report had to be agreed upon unanimously or it
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:52.760]  didn't get in the report you know and everything of that nature so uh it doesn't surprise me a bit
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:47:00.520]  alex well the fact is the system is scared of free thinkers people that will tell it like it is
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:06.680]  yourself myself ron paul and so many others but as you pointed out earlier the answer is everybody
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:15.560]  speaking out everybody not going along with the cookie cutter mainline uh system well again i wish
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:20.840]  i'll tell you what we you know you and i talked about organizing a boycott of the airports for
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:27.960]  one day i'd like to change that now and i think we need to organize and we need to protest the fact
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:35.320]  that the upcoming election will only be between two hand-picked people by the gangs we need to get
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:42.520]  gary johnson in the debates and i think if we're going to stand up and be counted there is the spot
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:48.120]  to do it because it's right on the horizon why should we only get the two voices of the two
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:53.480]  bribed out parties where you're going to get businesses you know when you've got a brilliant
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:58.840]  man like gary johnson waiting in the wings who would make an outstanding president and by the way
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:04.520]  by the way i saw clips on the news too we've got the clip in there was it seeing in our msnbc
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:09.000]  where they were criticizing you you were on the show they're like we don't like the fact that you're
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:16.280]  you know uh criticizing uh uh you know calling them gangs did do you remember that interview oh
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:22.520]  yeah absolutely they uh you know they they came after me real hard in fact the guy tried to lecture
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:28.520]  me that i need to go out and talk to people to learn what a real gang is the clips in the blots
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:34.760]  and i find that laughable considering i used to be a third patch member of the mongolese motorcycle
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:42.280]  club the black and white is southern california so i i speak from experience i've been in a gang
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:48.760]  and i've also been in government these bozos on tv all they do is go to college and write a book
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:54.200]  they have no life experiences they wouldn't know the inside of a gang if it came up and bit them on
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:49:01.160]  the ass well said let's jam in some calls the time we have left with jessie ventura uh joe
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:08.520]  in south carolina you're first up go ahead hey uh governor ventura thanks for seeing my call um
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:13.480]  i'm just curious uh you know if we want to be romney or obama after this i mean what is your
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:17.320]  prediction as to what the future will hold as far as tsa and whatnot i mean do you think
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:22.120]  she's just going to keep going on this way absolutely it won't matter which guy wins whether
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:27.080]  it's romney or obama because they're all going to go at the premise just like they won't cut the
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:34.360]  military budget at all no mainstream candidate will cut the military budget a bit because none of them
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:41.640]  want to what none of them want to be portrayed as soft on defense my god we have enough nuclear
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:47.640]  bombs we have enough military power our entire military budget is larger than the whole rest
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:55.480]  of the world's damn dear i mean nobody can beat our military it can't be done right now why do we
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:50:00.680]  continue to have a military like that and getting back to your question it don't matter if you get
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.640]  romney or obama you're going to get the same policies you've had and the same ones you're

[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:05.400]  lot of people out there with more courage than me too i don't know any but anyway jesse i wanted to
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:12.040]  know why you were not on coast to coast i was looking forward to that with the reason was my
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:18.440]  schedule said they were supposed to call me at 10 o'clock at night i sat up at 10 o'clock until
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:25.160]  1115 and no call and so i finally just got tired went to well that was probably just a time zone
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:32.200]  issue you know i think somebody screwed up and and and either i got the wrong because my i according
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:38.280]  to my schedule i was supposed to be on from 10 to midnight i sat waited from 10 o'clock until
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:44.760]  1115 and my eyes wouldn't stay open all right well listen we'll i'm sure it's a time zone issue so
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:48.440]  i'm sure that's gonna happen that's an important show to do you want to get the word out it'll be
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:52.600]  more than all the shows you've been on combined probably um 16 million listeners tonight thank
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:58.600]  you so much christine erin and canada you're on the air with jesse ventura hey jesse ventura
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:04.600]  mr jones how's it going good go ahead hey i was just wondering how jesse ventura feels about info
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:11.480]  wars and alex jones selling pens and canteens from china okay there's a nice little we sell a lot of
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:16.520]  stuff made in america but uh we sell things from all over we sell i think i think the inside of the
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:22.680]  canteen is made in the u.s i think the can is made in china yeah well fine what about walmart everything
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:28.120]  they sell comes from china too no no it's just a troll call i mean it so i mean that's what people
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:33.560]  do you know what are you supposed to do go out i mean i don't look at the label of where everything
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:38.920]  was made if i want something well we listen we try our best most of what we sell is made in the
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:44.360]  united states uh and i've nothing against the people in china having jobs i'm against paying
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:51.240]  20 million dollars to ship general motors to china that's wrong uh so it's just a cowardly attempt to
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:57.320]  make us and not only that alex when i use fireworks most of that all comes from china and i certainly
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:02.520]  enjoy that on the fourth of july oh it's all just ridiculous we're all evil actually i actually did
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:07.160]  i just bought some fireworks before this you lie i'm bad shannon in wisconsin uh you're not calling
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:15.640]  on a phone made in china are you uh probably probably is hey um hi jesse hi alex hey you guys
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:20.520]  are i'm honored you're too much thank you we're almost out of time do you have a question uh you
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:27.320]  know you had the thing uh say use your listeners for assets uh my question is with the tfa crap
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:33.400]  that's going on why can't we have a staged planned event you know to get the media hype because you
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:37.640]  know it's always that people don't react until it hits home you know like the like the guy getting
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:43.080]  his uh grandpa will pass his thumb let me interject one of the problems with that just
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:49.320]  like the iraq war there were massive police protests against the iraq war but you're dealing with
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:55.240]  mainstream media they ignore them if we were to go protest one of the chances that mainstream
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:58:00.040]  media would even cover it by the way governor this just broke today i'll ask you when we come back
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:05.000]  the next segment about it they dump the guy's grandpa's ashes out to just basically see what
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:11.720]  they were and then laugh at him uh that's in mainstream television this shows how crazy the tsa is
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.360]  oh i i i agree with that and let me make one statement here before we go and this is the
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:26.600]  all military veterans as well as current military personnel remember you took an oath to defend the
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:32.600]  constitution and the bill of rights against all enemies foreign and domestic especially the
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:39.320]  current military do not do not go against your own you know yes sir yes sir we'll come right back

[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:31.000]  all right coming up establishment media is getting people ready for a total collapse where they'll
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.720]  pose as saviors let's get really creepy we're continuing your calls now i got a guest talk

[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:45.880]  and a bunch of other world news we haven't gotten to yet but right now let's go back to laurence in
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:51.480]  virginia laurence you were talking about and you got cut off by the break people that are big tv
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:55.800]  watchers the average adult thinks four and a half hours a day the average child's over six the average
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:01.720]  video game a video game player is an additional three plus i mean the number change each year
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:05.400]  it gets worse that's the numbers are a few years old i should look up the latest numbers
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:11.160]  but i've seen numbers of some people that watch up to you know 14 hours a day of tv or video games
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:18.040]  combined it is insane and they are in a dreamlike state and they repeat whatever they see on television
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:23.000]  thinking that makes them smart it's only one echelon of people that even watch the news and
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.240]  they think they're smart just for watching it and they will regurgitate what they heard
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:32.840]  like they're showing off that they're smart uh still others that don't even watch the news
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:39.240]  they just get the messages from tv that's why the dramas the sitcoms the fiction is just laced
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:46.920]  anti-family anti you know you name it anti-gun and for those of us that are awake it's like watching
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:55.240]  clowns on pcp like lemmings run off the edge of a cliff go ahead well people tell me things like
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:02:00.920]  well i i uh i don't let it control me i only watch certain things forward get this information
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:08.760]  of that and you know they've never read stuff like it with bernay's information and i don't think
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:14.200]  any of us are smarter than them they've been practicing this for over 100 years um you know
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:19.240]  you you know you try to it's like trying to outsmart the devil no exactly you've just got to know
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:23.240]  it's super dangerous and there are a bunch of liars listen i track what they do constantly
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:29.800]  and it's such a spaghetti of deception it's like a cauldron that they're they're not even in control
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:35.160]  they're like riding the beast just like the bible says the new world order is like a whore
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:38.600]  riding the out of control beast you see what i'm saying exactly
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:47.400]  i think people really need to turn that thing off um i stopped watching it years ago um
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:51.720]  of course i didn't increment first i stopped watching the news around clinton when clinton
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:58.440]  was president because he was lying all the time uh and i just i just i got i ended i don't watch
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:04.040]  that thing anymore i get my information from the internet um i read a lot i think people
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:09.480]  need to read more uh you can't really judge anything and you have to read a lot of different things
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:14.200]  if you just read one thing you're going to get one one opinion well what's going to happen is
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:19.560]  over time you're going to learn who's lying on purpose who does an overall good job that makes
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:27.800]  some mistakes that's what we do uh who who tells the truth but puts a spin on it and you know you
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:33.000]  learn you learn where people stand just by watching what they do by their fruits you will know them
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:39.560]  and for anybody who sits there i mean i saw some so-called libertarian leader yesterday
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:45.480]  i've never even heard of at the porcupine fest uh say you know don't engage in conspiracy theories
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:50.280]  and then they defined conspiracy theories as thinking the government tries to take power
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:55.640]  or do corrupt things and i'm like well i mean what moron in any culture doesn't know you better
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:03.080]  keep the government under control or it'll grow out of control like cancer and uh it it it it just
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:09.880]  shows how over the top everything's gotten and just how desperate the power structure is to try to
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:15.240]  get people back into trust in the system look the general public doesn't trust the system anymore
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:20.840]  they just feel powerless and don't pay attention and so really aren't in the game we've got to get
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:25.400]  people in the game to realize you're not going to have to save the world by yourself you've
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:31.400]  got to do just little things little things that will bring down the new world order together all

[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:07.800]  proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:16.680]  you know for all the bad things that are happening it's a cycle throughout history
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:22.920]  of tyranny comes in the people get oppressed they fight back people get morals again because
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:29.560]  they realize morals are about survival taking care of your children then people become decadent
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:35.400]  because once you have liberty you get plenty you become decadent over a few generations
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:40.680]  corruptions creeps back in and the tyranny comes back in and the cycle happens over and over again
[02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:46.280]  and we've entered a very dangerous point in the cycle right now where the power structure
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:51.720]  realizes the pendulum wants to swing back towards freedom and truth and decency and honor
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:55.880]  and quality and beauty and so they're trying to push it back the other way
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:02.840]  we're in a five year now for the next 30 minutes or so then i'm going to go to your phone calls
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:09.560]  we are joined by a filmmaker and you know this came in a few months ago before it was
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:13.800]  officially coming out and welden said hey do you want to carry this it's a new vaccine film and i
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.120]  said we already carry some presentations by dr sherry tim pinning who's by the way in this we
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:22.680]  already carry some books and he said okay he watched he said you i think you need to watch this
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:28.440]  and it's one i don't know one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.720]  plus big film festivals
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:42.280]  it's the greater good and it is a film by the way that we carry at info wars.com
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:45.800]  see support us and the filmmakers when you get it and get a free citizen rulebook
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:49.400]  this is something you should give to every school library
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:57.000]  donate it to every public library you want to fight the new order folks that's a great way
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.640]  to get my films other people's films i authorize you to make copies of my films by the way just
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:07.880]  libraries won't tend to take them though it's a bad copy but side issue the point is you know a bad
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:12.280]  looking cover because they think it's bootleg or something we allow you to bootleg but they won't
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:17.240]  side issue the point is you should air these on access television you should give it to people
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:21.800]  that you see that have children and you have neighbors you see that the woman is pregnant
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:27.560]  i can't help it i see pregnant women now in grocery stores even with her husband
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:30.840]  and i'll come over and i'll say man isn't it great i've got three children
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:35.480]  hey you might want to look into vaccines because they even tell pregnant women to take vaccines
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:40.360]  now and until four years ago they always said don't take them because of autoimmune problems and
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:45.640]  miscarriages and a lot of times they go yeah we heard that it was always bad to take shots
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:51.400]  my sister's a nurse this just happened about a week ago the lady said and she says until a few years
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:55.880]  ago they said don't take them but now they're saying we should but she's saying i shouldn't thank you
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:00.280]  and if somebody does say hey man you're on business i've never had that happen
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:05.240]  just say okay i warned you and again that's not getting in somebody's business if you know
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:11.320]  that until about three and a half four years ago was a big pr rollout saying especially
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.480]  pregnant women all the inserts before and by the way they still say it said don't take this
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:19.880]  when you're pregnant or and then now they say we'll talk to your physician because they've
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:24.840]  always known this i mean doctors nurses listening they're like yeah that's always in the case again
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:31.160]  the system is fleeing forward in that they know there's massive opposition the media admits that
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:35.960]  they admit all these medical people are coming out all this is unfolding and so their answer is
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:43.320]  well they've got national maps the higher educated area of the country the lower the vaccine rates
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:49.320]  and the news says these these wealthy well-to-do college educated people have gone crazy
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:57.480]  no ladies and gentlemen we've gone from one in 25,330 something years ago with autism to
[02:11:57.480 --> 02:12:02.600]  one in 58 now and it's a cocktail of things but the point is this stuff is deadly and it's not
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:07.240]  just the mercury that goes by the blood brain barrier because it's directly injected into the
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:13.640]  body it's the adjuvants dr. blalock brain surgeon and others are broken down and they have studies
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:18.920]  on this they know enough of me because i want to give her at least 30 40 minutes before we go to
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:23.800]  your calls it's just that i want you to understand this is so life and death and this is finally the
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:30.440]  tool just like a noble lie is great to expose false flag terror finally a high quality professional
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:35.800]  film with all the police officers and witnesses about clinton carrying out that attack a noble
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:42.120]  lie available at info warshot com finally we have the greater good available at info warshop.com

[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.440]  amazing here's the trailer the trailer's up at info wars.com if you're a regulator but here for the
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:28.280]  full audience is the video slash audio of the trailer for the greater good this has to be in
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:33.880]  the hands of every nurse every doctor force them morally to face what's happening every family
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:40.040]  getting ready to have children you need to see the greater good very well produced key testimony
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:45.080]  about the cover up the fact they know it's killing and naming people consciously the cdc zone
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:52.280]  documents this is the proof here is the trailer two years ago vaccine completely changed my life
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:14:01.320]  i would do anything to my life back to history teaches us how effective vaccines vaccines
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:05.960]  are the best choice for almost all children i don't think it's that black and white vaccines
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:10.600]  in some way have been a victim of their own success the government they're trying to protect society
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:16.920]  but these motivations interfere with you know safety issues in the last few decades the numbers of
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:22.760]  doses of vaccines have more than triple we are seeing a rise in the number of children with disabilities
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:27.560]  what if these shots that are supposed to protect kids actually hurt your child after the shots i
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:33.480]  started getting sick i've had two strokes partial paralysis partial vision and i'm having seizures
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:37.160]  i would have never dreamt that this was a side effect of a vaccine
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:44.200]  many of these have the potential to be neurotoxic the research is incomplete and the certainty is
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:48.920]  not scientific a number of prescription drugs that have been licensed as safe have been found to
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:56.200]  be unsafe the social fabric it is better to insist on vaccination than to allow free reign the people
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:01.320]  who are approving the vaccines are taking the word of the pharmaceutical companies the majority of
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:08.040]  vaccine research is paid for by the vaccine manufacturers themselves we're the only country
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:13.320]  other than new zealand that allows advertising on tv for pharmaceutical drugs you can't sue
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:18.120]  the drug company that made the vaccine that's not science that's politics texas governor rick
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:23.080]  perry has ordered that schoolgirls must get the guard is still shocked we can do this the easy
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:29.080]  way or we can do this the hard way the only thing that we oppose is forced vaccination sadly some
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:35.400]  people don't do what's best for their children unless it's mandated we're not zealots we're not
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:41.000]  some people that are looking for a conspiracy or a fight the vaccine program it's one size fits
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:47.480]  all we worry about the future you could have 30 40 50 different vaccines mandated and absolutely no
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:54.280]  accountability you have a prescription for disaster i have a child and then i follow the rules and i
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:16:01.720]  damage this time that's hard for me to understand i just want everybody to lay down their arms and
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:09.880]  figure out what is making them so sick the greater good available at info warshop.com
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:16.280]  but again it goes from the perspective of showing both sides that's what makes it so effective but
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:22.600]  here's the issue they have the clips that i talked about four years ago in marilam where they said
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:27.640]  it's the law you'll be arrested if you don't take shots with all the black people like it's a
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:34.680]  concentration camp being herded in to be shot up with darking police dogs and i got the state
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:40.040]  attorney who says that on my show he started laughing and admitting it wasn't the law and that he
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:46.200]  didn't give his kids the shots like it was cute and cool and they've got that clip from years ago
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:51.240]  i couldn't find in the film that's why it's so powerful all right i've given you the pitch
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:56.840]  get it out to everybody this is coffin nails for their lives and i will say what the film
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:01.400]  doesn't i have all the Rockefeller documents the sterile and senate the cancer viruses
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:07.160]  it's on purpose okay it's that simple the the Rockefeller took over medicine 80 90 years ago
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:12.120]  they funded hitler kaiser villum institute it's eugenics better learn about it better find out
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:18.280]  then they sell you the treatments that they control as well all right i want to go to leslie
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:28.520]  who is our guest leslie manookian and she is the writer of the film and producer i know that's a
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:32.600]  big intro with me ranting we're going to break here in a few minutes but you've got the floor
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:39.800]  tell us about this film and any comments about my points i just made well uh thank you so much
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:44.840]  for the fantastic introduction and um for having me on the show alex it's really a pleasure to be
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:49.960]  here um i i couldn't agree with you more that this is one of the most important issues that we've
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:59.080]  faced today on the planet and um you know you talk about um the uh the really cavalier attitude
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:02.680]  of this public health official saying that you know he doesn't give him to his own kids but he's
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:08.200]  rounding up literally 2000 families for not giving their kids chickenpox vaccine or something like that
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:15.240]  and i think we all really have to ask ourselves what have we come to where are we and um are these
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:20.280]  policies based on sound science are these have these these compounds that we're injecting into our
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:27.160]  12 hour old infant safe um is there a reason to be doing this and i think the answer to all those
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:32.120]  questions is really that the science doesn't support it that the science isn't there and that
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:39.720]  these policies are not based on um um on a sound foundation of science and if that's not the case
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:44.920]  then how can we possibly be endorsing this in particular given that we require children
[02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:49.960]  in many states to have them before they can go to school um or for other public health services
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:57.320]  which are paid through taxes um so i think we're really in a place where um you know people need
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:03.720]  to start questioning what we're doing and why and why god gave us immune systems um in the first
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:09.080]  place and what we can do to keep those so strong and healthy um and whether or not we need um the
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:14.120]  government to tell us how to behave or how to keep our immune system functioning well as you point
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:17.880]  out if some pandemic came out and then they had something that was proven to be effective that's
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:23.480]  one thing but hundreds of vaccines they want to bring online and imply like peri did that it's the
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:29.640]  law when it wasn't the law and through fraud like in maryland or texas people line up believing
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:34.680]  they're being forced to well and this is a thing i live in the state of idaho and in idaho we have a
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:41.400]  a law that says very clearly that any person can choose for any reason they seem appropriate
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.880]  not to vaccinate themselves or their child but that does not stop the school district every
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:51.640]  year from taking out large advertisements in the newspaper stating that children must be immunized
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:55.560]  before they can come to school lisa bingo let's come back and talk about that fraud and write down

[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:14.680]  the greater good dvd award-winning film now available on dvd anthony coughman of the wall
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:21.000]  street journal wrote a new documentary about childhood immunizations the greater good could
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:28.280]  intensify debate around the potential dangers of vaccines uh yeah it's like a handing two-year-olds
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:35.400]  loaded shotguns uh i mean this is just amazing that that they've gotten away with this and our guest
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:45.160]  lisa uh who is uh uh uh uh leslie who's joining us right now was just breaking down if she's the
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:52.440]  uh writer and producer of this film she was just breaking down the deception how they
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:57.800]  how they say it's the law and then i get the guy on a go you know it's not the lawn he laughs
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:02.760]  he goes yeah i know i don't give my kids shots i mean this is sick how in every town you're
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:07.720]  listening and they lie to you and say it's the law uh please continue we you know what alex i think
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:14.040]  the most interesting thing is that um we never actually studied the safety of mercury before it
[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:19.640]  was put into childhood vaccines we never studied whether it was safe to put in contact lens solutions
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:24.360]  or in antacids or any of the places it's been put aluminum's been put in there too we never studied
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:30.360]  the safety of aluminum and it's been used as an adjuvant uh immune system stimulant for 80 years
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:35.800]  in vaccination and what's really interesting to me now is that in the last three to five years
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:41.400]  there's a growing um group of scientists who are actually starting to do this research despite the
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:47.320]  fact that it's very very risky for their careers and their futures and they are finding that the
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:53.880]  aluminum vaccine is causing cognitive impairment brain damage neuron cell death in animal models
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:00.600]  autoimmune syndromes all sorts of immune dysfunction and um these authors have written
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:07.080]  that the potential for just aluminum just the aluminum component on its own to cause profound
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:14.520]  impact on the brains and the immune systems of human beings is profound immense and yet the
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:19.400]  cdc and fda say that it's perfectly safe and this is what i find the most astounding is that this
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:24.600]  has been going on for not just a few years but nearly a hundred years and yet no one's bothered
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:29.800]  to stop it well i saw mainline studies out of england and the us a decade ago where they were
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:37.320]  saying three shots for the flu three vaccines doubled the chances for Alzheimer's in studies
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:43.320]  they did they know they know aluminum cans and aluminum cookware i mean there there are 45 year
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:50.040]  olds getting Alzheimer's now neurological disorders off the charts cancer off the charts
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:55.640]  everything we do in western culture the bisphenol a is now big studies linked to brain tumors
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:03.880]  uh linked to women going into puberty early men becoming feminized this industrial society
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:09.560]  the way it's been deployed is killing us without a doubt and if you look at the
[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:15.800]  the fertility rates the sperm counts of men in the last 50 years a decline of 50 at least
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:21.880]  if you look at you know how difficult it is for women to conceive same thing and um there's
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:26.520]  clearly a role that vaccines play and the vaccines that the toxins that vaccines contain
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:32.920]  in disrupting our endocrine systems our hormonal systems so you know i don't know how far um the
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:37.560]  average person wants to go down that rabbit hole i mean clearly your viewers and listeners are far
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:44.040]  more um up to speed on those issues than the um massive you know the the general public
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:50.520]  but they're they're clearly questions raised when we start taking vaccines that have aluminum
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:54.920]  and mercury in them that or mercury that's been banned in the united states and give them to the
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:00.760]  entire world outside the u.s. and other developed countries um it really has to give you pause about
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:04.920]  what the policies are really about and when we know that these things are disrupting our
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:09.640]  hormonal balances and then you combine them with all the pesticides and as you say that the spenal
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:15.160]  a and all the other contaminants in our food supply the gmo food you know on and on and on these
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:21.080]  things are clearly having a major impact on our ability to procreate our ability to think
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:26.920]  independently on our ability to stand up for ourselves um and our ability i think to really
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:33.720]  question what's going on and um vaccines are um you know without going too far down that rabbit
[02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:40.600]  hole clearly are causing damage and i think the point of our film is that not that we know all of
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:46.040]  this it's proven not that it's unequivocal but that there is a growing body of science out there
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:54.280]  that asks question on vaccines all i know is women's breast cancer is up 2000 plus percent
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:59.800]  pediatric cancer depending on which type over 10 000 autism thousands and thousands of percentage
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:06.680]  from 25 000 to one in 68 one in 57 i mean i mean it varies the numbers uh everywhere where it's
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:14.360]  industrialized uh neurological disorders skeletal disorders what's going on is killing us and let's
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:21.240]  talk about the autism thing the cdc and fda the vaccine authorities in general continue to assert
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:27.880]  that there is no science leaking mercury to autism and yet an independent scientist um
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:32.680]  did a review of all of the available science empirical research looking into the mercury
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:36.840]  autism link and she found that the body's time favorite link three to one sounds the reverse
[02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:40.840]  stay there we're gonna come back and break down some more of those numbers there's been other
[02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:47.160]  big studies as well where nations that have higher vaccine rate have higher rates of all
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:56.040]  sorts of diseases we'll be right back coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the
[02:29:56.040 --> 02:30:04.520]  alex jones broadcasting network network hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about

[02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:20.200]  who's a boss on this highway so watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way if you
[02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:28.520]  break the law you'll hear from me i know i'm working for the state i'm a highway patrol

[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:41.240]  flashing red light i'll work all day and i'll work all night just to keep it on order trying to do
[02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:47.720]  us right if i write you out a ticket then you better drive slow i'm just a done my job earlier i was
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:55.960]  looking around for the proper quote in providence my memory was correct it was a marine corps general
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:34:01.560]  known as the professor because he studied so much military doctrine and was so successful in world
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:10.440]  war two and the korean war they were surrounded at the chosin reservoir in korean war early in
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:18.840]  december 1950 to be precise they were surrounded he succeeded in breaking through and leading a 70
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:23.480]  mile march to safety it was reportedly more than 20 times their numbers i just went and looked it up
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:31.480]  on the history site who he was from my memory uh and he said sir we are surrounded excellent we can
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:37.160]  attack in any direction because that wasn't really even a sarcastic point if you've got a smaller force
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:42.840]  but have more high power workable weapons because the communist chinese that were fighting didn't
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:48.520]  have very good weapons that matter if it's 10 20 30 times the number now you can attack in any
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:53.960]  direction go any direction you want and of course some would look at it as i mean obviously it's a
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:35:00.040]  bad place to be in but now you're committed now there's not any games now you know you've got to
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:05.640]  fight and that's the position we have to put ourselves in you know i get emotional about this
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:12.040]  because i sit here calmly researching this year after year and when i pop this in the dvd player
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:17.960]  and because i would go from memory and say oh yeah the state attorney i had him on lining up
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:22.840]  thousands of black people crying with dogs barking at him saying it's the law you gotta take shots and
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:28.520]  i got him on and said hey you know it's not the law to take shots you know you should have told
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:33.960]  him about the waiver and he said oh you should be a lawyer i mean the interview's out there
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:39.160]  oh you if in fact now that we know his name is in the film so i've forgotten we gotta look it up
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:42.840]  and find that whole interview because it's amazing it was on cnn they're going it's a lot of take
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:49.400]  shots kids crying was shown all over the country to make you think it's the law and a total fraud
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:52.840]  and i get the guy on he's like yeah you ought to be a lawyer i want to be a lawyer because i know
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:58.440]  a little bit about reality and he's like yeah i don't vaccinate my kids it started laughing like
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:04.680]  it's funny that he knows it's bad he doesn't do it to his kids but he goes out with police standing
[02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:09.400]  behind him and goes we can do this the easy way or the hard way you will take it or you will go to
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:15.960]  jail and and we we tried to get our media people out there to talk to the families lined up with
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:20.360]  the police dogs and the riot cops and the police were like get back don't talk to them so they could
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:27.240]  engage in a fraud and shoot them up again does that give you any idea how wicked these governments are
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:30.280]  what else are they lying to you about it you bet i get emotional about that
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:35.880]  because in nazi germany we use that example that's where it happened medical tyranny
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:45.240]  soviet union same deal going back to our guest the maker of the documentary film
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:53.240]  the greater good leslie manoukian available at info warshop.com for for 10 minutes i'm going to
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:59.160]  shut up because i'll keep asking questions you've got the floor why should people see this film
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:05.480]  what will they see in the film who should people show this to can people air it on access television
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:12.280]  i mean how do they how do they show this to people and save lives well at this point it's
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:16.120]  interesting to me we were asked that who's your target audience who do you want to see this film
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:23.720]  we want everybody to see the film because there are somewhere between 200 and 400 vaccines in
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:30.280]  development right now and the vaccine authorities want every man woman and child on the planet to
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:36.360]  have vaccines every year of their life basically from cradle to grave that's what's being recommended
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:41.560]  with the flu vaccine and there are many others that are coming down the pipe so you know people
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:46.440]  often think that oh i had my kids my kids are 10 my kids are 12 they're grown i don't have to worry
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:51.640]  about this anymore this issue actually affects all of us and as you so rightly mentioned early on in
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:57.640]  the show um neurodegenerative diseases are on the rise and not just a little bit but they're
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:03.960]  reaching epidemic proportions most adults nowadays when in their elderly years develop some kind of
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:11.000]  dementia and that's not the way it's always been and um it's not supposed to be that way and so you
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  know the reason we made the film is because we wanted to reach everybody and help people to
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:20.280]  understand that this is an issue they should all care about um for their for their children's health
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:26.760]  but also for their own but also very importantly for them to understand that this issue is not nearly
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:32.280]  as black and white as they've been told by the mainstream media um you know we are constantly
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:37.720]  told that there's no science showing that vaccines cause any harm we're constantly told that there's
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:44.680]  no evidence that vaccines are linked to autism asthma allergies learning disabilities speech delays
[02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:50.760]  on and on and on gut issues all this stuff asthma and the reality is that i've compiled a document
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:59.400]  of over a hundred studies papers letters to editors and things like that that show that vaccines can
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:04.680]  cause inflammation of the brain and permanent damage that they can cause learning disabilities
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:09.160]  and behavioral problems that they can cause immunological problems that they can cause
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:15.080]  gut problems that they can cause a whole spectrum of autoimmune diseases and as i said earlier we're
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:19.480]  not you know all this research doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that vaccines are causing
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:25.000]  all these things but they certainly are enough to show that we should all have great great reason
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.600]  for concern and we should all want to figure out what the heck is really going on and whether or
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:35.800]  not more harm is being being done than good by using these vaccines so broadly um but i think
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:40.040]  the other really important issue that we raise with the film that i think is so vital for all of us
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:46.600]  to understand is who should decide what we put into our bodies do you want the government choosing
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:51.640]  how you keep yourself well or do you want to make that choice yourself and if we don't have the freedom
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:56.520]  to choose what we inject into our own bodies and do our children's bodies then are we really free
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:40:04.280]  it is no secret in science that vaccines injure and kill some people no secret and given that how
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:13.800]  can we possibly you know yield that right of self-determination to some nondescript faceless
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:17.720]  bureaucrat in another place i just you know so this is one of the major issues that we've
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:22.920]  tried to raise with the film it's helping people to understand that vaccines are not candy that
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:28.120]  there is a downside and to me alex this whole idea that vaccines are candy that they're just
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:32.280]  it's like drinking water is the reason why those people will line up in maryland to go and get
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:37.000]  the shots under threat of imprisonment and and find because they just think there's no downside
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.880]  they believe what they've been told and so we really hope the film helps people to understand
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:46.520]  that it's not black and white you like you've been told it's far more nuanced and maybe you'll
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:51.080]  choose that you want to get the polio vaccine maybe that's what some people choose maybe others
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:55.720]  will choose they don't want any vaccine but the point is that unless you're informed and you really
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:01.400]  understand what the issues are what the true long-term health ramifications are then you're not
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:08.360]  free to make those choices and we need to have that information leslie you pause there for me
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:13.640]  to interject i've had countless scientists doctors on some of them are in your film and
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:20.360]  i understand you're trying to be sound reasonable here and measured but i have talked personally
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:26.840]  on air to more than 500 over the years and to hundreds on the street every time i'm on vacation
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:32.360]  or something there's an autistic child sitting there you know by in the pool and i'll say hey
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:37.320]  do you mind me asking when did your son become autistic 18 months he was running around talking
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:41.720]  totally happy got the third round of shots had a convulsion in the station wagon driving home
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:46.920]  i know they used to arrest people till this came out when they would take the shot and they would
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:50.840]  collapse sometimes in the hospital they'd say oh you must have beaten them they had blood on the
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:55.880]  brain because of an autoimmune response they knew full well what they were doing uh they know
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:01.320]  they know that i mean the studies are legion and then i look at the Rockefellers and all and the
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:07.880]  Bill and Melinda Gates who say get rid of grandma uh euthanized people eugenics forced abortion
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:13.640]  but oh we want you to take shots to live longer we care about you uh this is setting a precedent
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:19.560]  for a very dangerous big pharma uh group most of which came right out of Germany and actually
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:23.880]  funded Hitler people study it i'm not kidding you can't make this up he was like their little
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:30.200]  creation who want medical tyranny to force this on us i have uh Nobel prize winner
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:35.480]  Bertrand Russell wrote repeatedly we're going to inject people and call them vaccines
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:39.880]  to brain damage them to make them more more manageable i mean look it up he says we're
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:45.880]  going to change the diet diet injections and injunctions to uh so the public will be sheep-like
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:50.200]  compared to the ruling elite so i've done the study my film in game blueprint for global
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:56.680]  enslavement covers it this is a premeditated program you take uh Bayer pharmaceutical for
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:43:02.360]  11 years knew they were shipping hiv hepatitis blood to hemophiliacs and the documents came out
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:06.920]  they knew and did it on purpose you have chemical biological radiological testing on foster children
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:12.360]  on troops killing them so so who is this in the government that did this and then when they get
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:18.120]  caught over the last 60 years they never get in trouble they never get in any trouble they
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:24.680]  net because listen my dad was top of his class in high school as a junior he was in this advanced
[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:30.200]  program they called him into the university of texas took him behind closed doors the top testers
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:35.560]  of 160 i think it was like six of them and gave them the speech that i'm giving you but but telling
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:40.040]  him you're going to be part of this okay and my dad's not that special if you're in the top of your
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:47.320]  class in texas or out or or or new mexico or new york you're getting this speech today that's what
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:53.560]  i'm telling people this is a giant covert eugenics program i know your film doesn't get into that
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:57.400]  you're wanting it to be you know very balanced i think it's that's why it's the key to get out there
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:03.400]  but any comments on what i'm talking about well first of all i think i would just comment that
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:07.720]  i actually am from the system you know i went to one of the best universities in the nation and i
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.800]  got an MBA from the university of chicago and i worked at goldman's tax for a period of years and
[02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:20.440]  then worked in finance for 13 years and i witnessed first hand a lot of um um overt and some not so
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:25.480]  or overt corruption i actually had the ceo of a pharmaceutical company come in and tell me that
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:32.040]  their blockbuster drugs that they were about to release um was showing that it was causing death
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:36.360]  in some of the patients it was treating and that the FDA was going to make them put a warning on
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:40.200]  their packaging because of this but the good news was they still thought they'd be able to do seven
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:48.200]  billion in peak sales that kind of stuff is not um isolated it's not unique it's going on all the
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:56.120]  time um i think the real issue is alex that the average person doesn't get that doesn't understand
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:02.840]  that and doesn't haven't connected the dots yet and so i you know i come from a place of wanting to
[02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:09.080]  educate people and bring them into the fold as easily as i possibly can and this is such an
[02:45:09.080 --> 02:45:18.360]  emotive issue that if we are too frightening um to frank um then i really worry that the message
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:24.760]  gets lost and so you know i i have a lot of um sympathy and uh appreciation for all those things
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:30.840]  that you just said and um but i think when it comes to the issue of vaccines that it's uh we will
[02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:36.680]  do um much more to further the message and bring more people into the fold to understand that they
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:42.920]  should want to um have freedom about what they put in their bodies and to make these choices um then
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:51.880]  by being more you know um inflammatory i guess and given that we are having a huge impact there
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:59.080]  was a a report just last week maybe the week before that um the federal government studied
[02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:05.080]  up um the vaccination rate in portland oregon and found that in the last five or six years i forget
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:11.080]  what the exact period was but it was in a recent period in the early 2000s that the um non-vaccinators
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:14.840]  rose from two and a half percent of the population to nine and a half percent of the population
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:20.440]  no that was in uh i think the sacramental b two days ago yeah and it's been all over the place
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:25.320]  for the last couple weeks but this the place that they studied was portland oregon and my point is
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:31.400]  that that that one city has seen the number of people not vaccinating go from two and a half to
[02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:37.320]  nine and a half percent in the last several years people are starting to wake up to this and in order
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:41.960]  to bring more people in what we really want to do is change laws what we really want to do is help
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:46.920]  is wake people up what we really want to do is empower people and we strongly felt as filmmakers
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:52.040]  that we do that by not beating them over the head but by helping no i agree with you i i mean i agree
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:57.480]  with this is something for the joe schmoe out there questioning uh leslie manoukian again the
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:03.160]  writer and producer of the greater good available at info warshop.com or their site greatergoodmovie.org
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:08.200]  i could tell you i've seen the film great filmmaker for somebody that i hadn't done a lot of media
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:14.520]  before i could tell you a lot of passion for this and it's a labor of love uh what woke you up to
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:20.760]  this is a good question um well you know like i said i was working on wall street for a long time
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:26.200]  and i had that experience i mean i was i i headed up alliance capitals european growth portfolio
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:30.920]  management business in london for a period of years and it was my job to interview ceo's of
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:38.600]  multinational corporations and um for many years i would sort of witness this stuff but not really
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:44.120]  it didn't really hit me until that ceo came in and told me that he was going to do seven billion
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:48.600]  of peak sales and kill a bunch of people in the private and i just realized that i was playing
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:55.080]  for the wrong team and shortly after that i met a man in london who told me that vaccines could
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:59.880]  cause harm and i literally thought the guy was nuts i said you know you're out of your mind
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:04.760]  vaccines are the greatest invention of humankind um there's no doubt in my mind that these things
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:09.480]  are great and he said listen that's the one perspective read read this book and he gave
[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:14.520]  me neil miller's book vaccines are they really safe and effective and i read it extremely skeptical
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:20.440]  i'm an analyst by nature um i was super skeptical but at the end of the book i went and i looked
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:26.440]  in the back and there were over 900 footnotes to peer reviewed medical literature and mainstream
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:34.200]  news pieces and i thought 900 over 900 references can this be true can this be real i didn't want
[02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:37.960]  to believe it but i committed to myself right then and there and this was about 11 years ago
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:42.680]  that someday i was going to make a movie on this and i was going to go and do my own research
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:49.000]  read the science myself and go and look these people in the eyes look cdc and fda and vaccine
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:55.080]  developers and patent holders in the eyes and ask them myself what's really going on here and
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:59.480]  you've done that and they look scared when you're talking to them you've had a home run the greater
[02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:04.680]  good again get this out to everybody and a little bit of time we've got left i want to go back though
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:11.160]  because i'm guessing because i've had experiences similar to this where you thought oh he's joking
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:15.080]  i'm going to make seven million and kill a bunch of people but i've interviewed genetic engineers
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:19.480]  who were making three million dollars a year they're like hey this potato is sterilizing the rats
[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:24.360]  but we're we're getting it approved and they're like yeah there's too many people that's you that's
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:29.000]  really the plan and then they think it's a joke but then it gets approved i mean do you think he
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:33.720]  was joking when he said i'm going to make seven million and kill people or did you go do research
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:39.320]  and realize it wasn't really a joke i realized that all that mattered to him with corporate profits
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:46.520]  and that that is really what is the the driver of everything in the world today i mean i guess i
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:53.160]  do i i've gotten to the point where i recognize that there is no separation between state and
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:58.680]  the corporate world anymore and that the only way that we are going to change that is to average
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:05.800]  the citizens stand up and hold their ground and this this was the first step for me in that process
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:09.240]  making this film to empower people so that they could stand up for themselves so that they could
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:13.320]  go to the lobby in california and say we're not going to support this bill that they've got in front
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:20.120]  of california now that'll require every person to get a vaccine exemption from a authorized medical
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:26.360]  provider every single year you know i just i i recognize that this guy was just delusional
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:31.480]  but that not just he was delusional but was there were all the other people who were part and parcel
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:36.440]  of it well well listen uh leslie manoukian you've had a home run i want to get you back on the

[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:56.040]  first off i want to appreciate you for everything you do man you're a true patriot um get a quick
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:59.560]  question for you i know it's kind of going to be kind of a difficult one to answer but with things
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:03.800]  speeding up the way they are how much longer do you feel like we have before the global globalists
[02:56:03.800 --> 02:56:10.360]  are going to implement implement a full scale collapse well many areas like greece and i have
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:20.040]  already collapsed into total bedroom um but six months a year the globalists won't do this right
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:24.200]  away or or they'll back off a little if they don't think we're going to go along with it
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:28.120]  but everywhere where they think they've got their people in place like spain and greece and other
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:32.200]  areas they're going to drop the hammer all the way i mean they hate the public they want to
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:40.680]  impoverish that's their stated uh eugenicist a post industrial view uh in fact i'm going to cover
[02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:45.240]  that coming up after calls but i mean it's the banks are getting ready the big mega banks that
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:51.080]  are just fronts for the private interests that own them they're getting ready to to bring down the
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:57.320]  zombie banks and when that happens when when goldman satch jp morgan and other ponzi scheme
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:05.560]  shell corporations are blown it is going to be it's going to make right now it's 50 50 that it's
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:10.520]  going to be road warrior level depression we're already in a depression but it's a slow sliding
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:17.320]  one from recession into depression and of course that's on the good side it is i mean now all the
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:21.640]  main analysts are saying you better give us everything or we're going to give you a total
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:27.400]  depression well we've already given them everything but their plan is the depression so i mean look
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:34.120]  at this article on a cnbc big banks craft living wills in case they fail and then here's another
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:38.440]  one avoiding a global catastrophe larry summers who helped engineer all this and he talks about
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:43.400]  things completely melting down well i mean it's mathematically impossible unless we write off
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:50.360]  the trillion the the 1.5 quadrillion 1,500 trillion even hard to say that number unless we
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:55.560]  write all that off and unless we explain that's not our debt and arrest all these people they're
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:58:00.520]  going to bring us into total global collapse that they're going to organize and pose as saviors
[02:58:00.520 --> 02:58:07.000]  with the prostitute decepticon collaborator vici french media telling us they're the saviors
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:12.840]  and it is going to get absolutely hellish with stage terror attacks new wars they're going to
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:18.360]  throw everything at us they have been massing basically on our border the new world order has
[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:23.720]  it in every city every town against us they are surveilling us they are trying to create attack
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:29.800]  forces death squads and they are just building up the armored bunkers the pill boxes the machine
[02:58:29.800 --> 02:58:36.920]  guns the shotguns the hollow point ammo the drones for all out war against us and let me tell you
[02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:46.120]  they're going to get their butts kicked coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the
[02:58:46.120 --> 02:58:52.840]  alex jones broadcasting network network
