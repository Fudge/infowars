[00:00.000 --> 00:23.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday Worldwide
[00:23.200 --> 00:28.960]  broadcast. I'm Alex Jones coming to you live from on the road in Florida doing a lot of
[00:28.960 --> 00:34.240]  exciting important things behind the scenes. Of course, the great Owen Shroyer, the Lib
[00:34.240 --> 00:42.160]  Tard destroyer is in the ATX in Austin, Texas. And yesterday, I tuned in and saw Harrison
[00:42.160 --> 00:45.440]  just hosting the show, which Harrison does a great job. We love Harrison. He hosts American
[00:45.440 --> 00:49.840]  Journal, a new father just a few weeks ago, already back in the saddle. I said, what is
[00:49.840 --> 00:54.160]  he doing? It's supposed to be Owen hosting in it. Oh, remember you told Owen, he used to go down
[00:54.160 --> 01:00.080]  and protest the Socialist Restaurant Association of Texas. It didn't exist until a few weeks ago.
[01:00.080 --> 01:05.440]  It's a Antifa group. And they want things to stay closed. And they have this new thing where they
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.480]  all pretend that they're in the movie, the gangs of New York, where they cross their arms and wear
[01:10.480 --> 01:16.480]  top hats, like they're the butcher, I guess, and then threaten people. So it's pretty hilarious.
[01:16.480 --> 01:22.560]  There's a full hour of it at Bandod video. But these are literally enforcers that want to control
[01:22.560 --> 01:28.800]  us. We got a five minute excerpt of that that we're going to be playing coming up. But they
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.960]  always wear masks. And so now they want us to wear masks, a symbol of being in their cult
[01:34.080 --> 01:40.400]  in their gang. But the big news we're going to be hitting is this little juicy right here.
[01:40.400 --> 01:48.320]  And this is all over the news. In fact, my wife texted me yesterday. I said, have you seen this?
[01:48.320 --> 01:53.600]  And I said, yeah. And what she sent me was MPR. So this is a major talking point. It's an ABC,
[01:53.600 --> 01:59.200]  NBC, New York Times, Washington Post. And this is not a dystopic joke. It's, oh, you'll be allowed
[01:59.200 --> 02:05.120]  out. Oh, you'll be allowed to sit on a park bench now like the UK saying vaccinated Americans allowed
[02:05.120 --> 02:12.720]  to taste freedom. Oh, you, you don't have to wear your mask if you've been inoculated.
[02:13.600 --> 02:20.400]  The CDC says, but Fauci says that's not true. So most good virtually signaling businesses,
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.960]  they are going to demand you still wear the mask. But we have the footage in Yuma, Arizona.
[02:26.960 --> 02:31.200]  Let me pull that up next time. My guys have got to tell you Yuma, Arizona was on infoworks.com
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.880]  last night. Hundreds and hundreds just in one video shot of just people walking across many
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.880]  of them with children, many of them children they've grabbed, that's admitted. And they're not even
[02:40.880 --> 02:45.040]  being tested. And when they do get tested, they go turn themselves in. They go, oh, you have COVID,
[02:45.040 --> 02:52.480]  you have TB, you have tuberculosis going in. It's all a giant virtue signal fraud.
[02:53.440 --> 02:58.080]  And the left can turn on their disdain and their disgrace when you're not wearing a mask
[02:58.080 --> 03:01.840]  or when you're not social distancing. Oh, but when it's illegal alien or somebody else,
[03:01.840 --> 03:07.840]  then it's totally fine. This is sick. This is a joke. Latin America has real diseases,
[03:07.840 --> 03:13.920]  real bubonic plague, real drug resistant TB. But any real problem is just ignored. Oh,
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.520]  and let's not even give these people treatment if we're going to take them in and go bankrupt.
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.920]  Let's go ahead and just let them in. So fraud upon fraud. But I thought you'd want to know.
[03:21.920 --> 03:30.800]  No. Here it is. Vaccinated Americans allowed to taste. Oh, please. I get a small drink of water
[03:30.800 --> 03:38.080]  in the desert. Oh, after a year and a half of locked away. It shows how it is a shelf and post
[03:39.040 --> 03:45.040]  lock. Now, because they're just, oh, I can take it off because I've had the shot. Yes,
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.640]  good slave. You can take it off. And then of course, they're just going to clamp it right
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.840]  back down. The same British Royal Academy that funded by Bill Gates that came out last year
[03:53.840 --> 03:57.760]  and said, oh, you know, we're going to have, we're going to have half a million Brits dive.
[03:57.760 --> 04:02.720]  We're going to have tens of millions of US citizens die. The numbers were first 18 million,
[04:02.720 --> 04:08.080]  then it was five million went on and on and two million never anywhere close that they're not
[04:08.080 --> 04:12.480]  saying sorry. The lockdowns are going to have to come back because it's going to be a viral surge.
[04:12.480 --> 04:16.320]  They can just direct all these corrupt hospital chains and testing companies of what the new
[04:16.320 --> 04:21.120]  guideline is of how many cycles on the PCR test. And then these companies are getting their medical
[04:21.120 --> 04:25.200]  directives of the technocracy. And so that's why they're allowed to engage in mass crime,
[04:25.200 --> 04:28.800]  including the new guillotine, the ventilator. But notice most of the tests are in New Jersey,
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.600]  New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and where these Democrat scumbag governors run things,
[04:33.600 --> 04:38.320]  because that's where they direct the states directly through the UN to murder you. They will
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.800]  murder you, including people we know that have been murdered with ventilators. So you want to be
[04:42.800 --> 04:47.040]  murdered, live in one of these blue states under their murderer's control. They will grab you,
[04:47.040 --> 04:51.680]  they will snake tubes down your lungs and then blast them out under total torture for weeks
[04:51.680 --> 04:58.240]  until you die. Then they will be received $53,000 cash for your murder back in 60 seconds.
[04:58.240 --> 05:03.840]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited. People ask me all the time,
[05:03.840 --> 05:08.480]  they go, Joe, are you on cocaine or are you on meth? How are you so excited? How do I not get
[05:08.480 --> 05:14.640]  excited about world government, forced mass, forced inoculations, open announcements that our
[05:14.640 --> 05:19.920]  country is going to be dissolved? I'm sorry. I'm a fighter. And I know many of you out there
[05:19.920 --> 05:24.960]  are watching and listening are fighters as well. And so I'll just say this. I try to be calm. I try
[05:24.960 --> 05:31.120]  to be focused. I don't know what I do if I wasn't still on air right now. But I just really want
[05:31.120 --> 05:36.240]  to thank you for keeping us on air, because you have to realize when I tell you that you're the
[05:36.240 --> 05:43.280]  Info War, that's not me patting on the head. You are 99% of the equation. So when you decide to
[05:43.280 --> 05:47.360]  spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, infowarstore.com, when you decide to
[05:47.360 --> 05:52.400]  share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world. So you are the Info War.
[05:52.400 --> 05:56.800]  Thank you so much for the fight. Thank you for all you've done. Now let's take action together
[05:56.800 --> 06:06.960]  and take down the globalist.
[06:06.960 --> 06:29.120]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:29.120 --> 06:33.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely honored that you're joining us on this live
[06:33.360 --> 06:41.120]  Tuesday, worldwide rug guests. I am your host, Alex Jones. Oh, Troyer is riding shot done with me
[06:41.120 --> 06:49.360]  in the ATX. We have the Republican strategist, analyst, great lady, very smart, a lovely person
[06:50.080 --> 06:56.000]  who was banned on Twitter a few days ago because she criticized pedophilia and said it was demonic.
[06:56.000 --> 07:05.760]  Twitter said that's not allowed. She'll be joining us coming up today in the second hour.
[07:06.480 --> 07:11.920]  I also want to tell you about some of the new things that are being banned, some of the new
[07:11.920 --> 07:16.960]  things that the big corporate America is teaching you are bad. Any term you can use
[07:17.680 --> 07:23.280]  to differentiate reality so that you can actually navigate the lies and fraud. There's a war on
[07:23.280 --> 07:28.480]  logic, a war on communication, a war on civilization. That's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[07:28.480 --> 07:35.200]  But Lauren Witski is going to be joining us of hold the line, pack.com. Coming up the second
[07:35.200 --> 07:40.000]  hour, all Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour before Owen Troyer and Emperor
[07:40.000 --> 07:48.000]  Papertine co-host the War Room three to six p.m. weekdays. But Owen Troyer is here. He's got a lot
[07:48.000 --> 07:55.200]  to cover, obviously, today. I don't normally read whole articles, but I saw this article here,
[07:55.200 --> 08:00.800]  say a friend sent it to me, and it's just so dead on, and it just makes me love Trump so much
[08:00.800 --> 08:05.760]  despite his failings because this is, this is truth. This is how Vladimir Putin and the Russians
[08:05.760 --> 08:09.920]  really see Trump. Trump was never a Russian agent, had no connections with the Russians,
[08:09.920 --> 08:16.080]  other than ideology, in that Russia has struggled partially free from the Soros Newell order satanic
[08:16.080 --> 08:23.120]  grasp. And so when they said, this is Russian collusion, they're really talking about metaphysical
[08:24.720 --> 08:30.960]  spiritual, and of course, all of that is manifested as cultural, very powerful article
[08:30.960 --> 08:37.120]  at americanthinker.com. And I've asked the crew to post at least a part of this on the link on
[08:37.120 --> 08:43.360]  infowars.com. So it gets more attention, but it's Putin's former chief of staff calls Trump a
[08:43.360 --> 08:49.760]  champion against the new world order. We're going to read this in the last segment of this hour.
[08:50.400 --> 08:56.080]  But I want to bring Owen Schreuer in to also give us a prelude of some of the things he's going to
[08:56.080 --> 09:01.680]  be covering. He'll be cozy with me in the first two hours. And then he'll be hosting the third hour
[09:01.680 --> 09:09.040]  all by his little lonesome, vaccinated Americans allowed to taste freedom, vaccinated Americans
[09:09.040 --> 09:17.360]  allowed to taste freedom. And just a little bit of you get the taste of just a taste of
[09:17.360 --> 09:23.440]  bitty little sweetsy taste. So this is not a laughing matter. This is totally sick. It's a
[09:23.440 --> 09:29.040]  total lie. But they're now admitting, Oh, none of the mRNA vaccines about the Johnson Johnson
[09:29.040 --> 09:36.320]  vaccine, that's a virus vector vaccine. None of those even protects you from COVID or other strains.
[09:36.320 --> 09:42.320]  So just have to keep taking new shots every month or so. Wow, that are experimental and
[09:42.320 --> 09:46.320]  have been linked to all sorts of deaths and problems. And I explain this to a lot of listeners,
[09:46.320 --> 09:50.480]  and I explain this to the crew. And I've got some of the great crews sitting around over here with
[09:50.480 --> 09:57.040]  me here in this condo little studio we have right now, coming to you from an undisclosed location
[09:57.040 --> 10:04.480]  in Florida. And they're like, Hey, boss, we ran into something new today. They're like, we were
[10:04.480 --> 10:09.440]  using on the road because it was better to upload videos to the crews. They could play them on the
[10:09.440 --> 10:16.320]  show via YouTube channels that they have privately. So was never posted was always private. And they
[10:16.320 --> 10:22.000]  both got strikes on their YouTube for violating the rules by putting out false medical information,
[10:22.000 --> 10:30.480]  not in line with the CDC or the WHO, because the WHO is our boss. They're now out in the open
[10:30.480 --> 10:35.600]  controlling every facet of our lives. And Joe Biden takes his orders directly from the UN now.
[10:35.600 --> 10:39.760]  This is an incredible time to be alive. And I said, guys, I know I'm trying to explain this.
[10:39.760 --> 10:44.080]  I know you're smart. Remember when we had like 100 Twitter handles two or three years ago during
[10:44.080 --> 10:49.840]  the purge. And I kept saying, stop uploading to our other Twitter accounts with the company
[10:49.840 --> 10:54.480]  cell phones. They have IP addresses. That's how they're banning them. For some reason,
[10:54.480 --> 10:59.760]  people didn't listen to me. And it just kept happening. And my point is, I'm not a tech guy.
[10:59.760 --> 11:03.520]  I don't know how it all works. That's what the policies are. And so finally,
[11:03.520 --> 11:06.960]  we started getting some burner phones that took them over a year and a half to ban our other
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.960]  Twitter accounts because it was all AI doing it. So we have to think about how these systems work.
[11:12.960 --> 11:18.880]  And a lot of times just do a few little things for the general public, not just us and get around
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.840]  that. And if we would have gotten burner phones, like I said, and done that immediately, we would
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.080]  have kept most of those for a lot longer. And I'm only saying that now because I'm not just saying
[11:28.080 --> 11:35.120]  this. Okay, here's an example. When you upload a video to YouTube, Twitter or Facebook, it creates
[11:35.120 --> 11:41.520]  a word document. It creates a transcript that is then fed through an AI system that's been put
[11:41.520 --> 11:47.600]  together by consortium of the Southern Poverty Law Center, media matters, and the ADL. That's
[11:47.600 --> 11:52.880]  if it's political, what they call hate speech like mother, father, the word normal now is being banned,
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.120]  Congress has banned the word mother, father, sister, brother, grandmother, grandfather. I mean,
[11:57.120 --> 12:02.640]  this isn't a science fiction movie. This is a 1904. This is real. Well, you're like, well, just
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.920]  ignore them. No, your phone, a lot of phones now, especially iPhones, won't type something
[12:07.920 --> 12:11.760]  that's an improper word. But first, it wouldn't let you spell it or would recommend something else
[12:11.760 --> 12:16.080]  with autocorrect. Now it just won't let you. So that's where all this digital straight jacket's
[12:16.080 --> 12:20.000]  going. And so you can read into it. And the guys looked it up, they confirmed it.
[12:20.000 --> 12:28.880]  Everything you're doing is being watched in live time by AI before you're even allowed to publish
[12:28.880 --> 12:33.760]  it. And then you're not. They've had congressional hearings about it. It's all been done. This is
[12:33.760 --> 12:40.000]  so beyond draconian. And this is what a technocracy is, is where they just pre-program your car doesn't
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.280]  work when they don't want it to. They just pre-program your air conditioner doesn't turn
[12:43.280 --> 12:47.520]  on when they or they control your thermostat. And it's not like I'm telling you this out of a
[12:47.520 --> 12:52.560]  crystal ball. This is all the plan in to incrementally roll it out. So all the political censorship
[12:52.560 --> 12:55.840]  you see, the censorship of the president, the censorship of governors, the censorship of
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.200]  legislatures, the censorship of other corporations and companies. This is only the beginning where
[13:01.200 --> 13:05.200]  very soon you'll be forced to have a phone that tracks you and listens to you as a personal
[13:05.200 --> 13:10.720]  assistant. You'll be forced to have a personal assistant, digital assistant, like Alexa in
[13:10.720 --> 13:16.960]  your home or you will not be allowed to have power or have running water or have a house.
[13:16.960 --> 13:21.920]  This is the social credit score and that it will mind you and watch you. You will then be forced
[13:21.920 --> 13:28.000]  to join on a Facebook-like program. There'll probably be Facebook, a communal group chat,
[13:28.640 --> 13:32.800]  whereas you live in a communal group and where they get to see your photos and what you do
[13:32.800 --> 13:37.120]  and nothing is private because they have to be a judge of what you're doing. They already have AI
[13:37.120 --> 13:42.480]  doing it, but they want other people to be in control of you. Then they move to no more single
[13:42.480 --> 13:46.400]  family dwellings, which they've already banned in most parts of the world under agenda 21,
[13:46.400 --> 13:50.480]  most liberal cities because they're not liberal, they're authoritarian. They are doing all of this
[13:51.040 --> 13:55.600]  and so you will then have to live in a 200 square foot coffin apartment.
[13:56.480 --> 14:01.840]  Larger ones will be 400 square feet. It'll empty into a communal area that's a panoptagon. It'll
[14:01.840 --> 14:08.240]  be a circle or a square with your six or four coffin rooms attached to it in your family,
[14:08.240 --> 14:13.920]  your children will then be given a score and put in with a group of globalist minders and
[14:13.920 --> 14:19.120]  controllers. And so the vaccine and all of this is just the rollout of that new beginning,
[14:19.120 --> 14:24.640]  a system so hellish it's beyond imagination. That's going to be tested first on people being
[14:24.640 --> 14:28.560]  brought in from the third world into Europe and the United States. And here's an example
[14:28.560 --> 14:34.080]  I've got as our security people, some great former army and folks who have also been contractors,
[14:34.080 --> 14:38.880]  and they were describing how these big defense contractors paid the Indian chefs
[14:38.880 --> 14:45.680]  that cooked their food $1 a day and put eight of them into a room smaller than what prisoners
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.640]  are in. That's what they expect to live like. And so we're not going to raise up the world with
[14:50.640 --> 14:57.600]  the West rising up and then it raising the third world. No, we're going down and they're going
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.320]  down. You understand, they're going down. We're going down to then meet at an absolutely horrible
[15:02.960 --> 15:07.280]  subsistence level where we eat bugs, we drink sewage and we eat weeds. That's Klaus Schwab.
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.320]  You're like, well, this doesn't make sense. The COVID lockdowns have already devastated 100 years
[15:12.320 --> 15:16.240]  of progress. Everything's already collapsing. They're inflating all the currency on purpose
[15:16.240 --> 15:20.880]  to bankrupt everything. This is economic warfare total takeover. And when they totally collapse
[15:20.880 --> 15:25.600]  the third world and billions of people are trying to immigrate to Europe and the United States,
[15:25.600 --> 15:30.320]  the global will then use that to control us politically with those groups they're bringing
[15:30.320 --> 15:36.080]  in to our populations. So this is total war. It's total dystopia. And we have to get the
[15:36.080 --> 15:40.640]  legislatures, we have to get the Congress, we have to get other leaders around the world awake to it
[15:40.640 --> 15:46.720]  to organize an alliance against this axis of post human Satanism. And that's why this situation
[15:46.720 --> 15:53.360]  out of Russia is so powerful. When we read this translated article by the former chief of staff
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.560]  of Vladimir Putin, we'll talk to Owen Schreuer on the other side. You know, it's crazy to get to
[15:58.560 --> 16:02.960]  this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it
[16:02.960 --> 16:06.880]  would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that. I care about beating the
[16:06.880 --> 16:11.760]  new world order. And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air
[16:11.760 --> 16:16.080]  much longer. And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us. For a lot of reasons,
[16:16.080 --> 16:20.480]  I can't tell you what's going on. But let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end,
[16:20.480 --> 16:25.680]  we're going to stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products
[16:25.680 --> 16:30.240]  and then forward store.com. They're great products, plus they fund the operation. So you know,
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.000]  unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.680]  don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.320]  and looking for truth. That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny
[16:44.320 --> 16:48.240]  and leave people like us on the air. So while you're at it, don't just financially support us
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.720]  and spread the word. Download everything we've done. You can find and save it because who knows
[16:52.720 --> 16:56.960]  how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.600]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars and we've brought you a new supplement,
[17:01.600 --> 17:05.600]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping. It is
[17:05.600 --> 17:10.080]  down and out. We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge. We mean down your bed sleeping hard
[17:10.080 --> 17:15.600]  throughout the night. It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin. It's got 25 milligrams of
[17:15.600 --> 17:21.280]  passion flower. It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate. It's got 100 milligrams
[17:21.280 --> 17:27.040]  of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very
[17:27.040 --> 17:31.440]  strong formula. I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time. It's liquid,
[17:31.440 --> 17:35.680]  so it goes right to your body fast. If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh,
[17:35.680 --> 17:40.240]  how about blasting off asleep? It's incredible. It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[17:40.240 --> 17:45.120]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock. Get yours today, down and out exclusively at

[17:52.240 --> 18:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:08.160 --> 18:25.440]  Back. And we're on the attack. And I was just thinking, I know why people don't want to believe
[18:25.440 --> 18:32.560]  a lot of this stuff, because globalism is an evil post human system that slowly strangles
[18:32.560 --> 18:42.720]  and destroys, takes full control over society. All right, let's go ahead and go to this important
[18:42.720 --> 18:51.440]  clip. And then I'm going to get Owen Schroyer's take on this. This is our puppet president who
[18:51.440 --> 18:54.960]  did steal the election with the chai comms. He doesn't even know what planet he's on.
[18:55.600 --> 18:59.120]  And again, if your globalists want to steal the election, you don't want another president
[18:59.120 --> 19:03.280]  because he might actually try to be president. He might actually exert some force. If you're a
[19:03.280 --> 19:09.920]  globalist consortium, you want a puppet. And Biden's as close to a puppet as I see any case in
[19:09.920 --> 19:14.880]  world history, other than maybe Boris Yeltsin, who was so incredibly drunk all the time,
[19:15.600 --> 19:22.160]  I didn't know what planet he was on. By the way, I'm pledging again. I've gone a long time off
[19:22.160 --> 19:26.400]  and on not drinking. I'm pledging here to the whole audience that I'm going to be a teetotaler again.
[19:26.400 --> 19:30.240]  I judge people to drink, but it's just with the stressful times, the way the world works. I know
[19:30.240 --> 19:34.240]  during the lockdown, a lot of folks are drinking too much. I know I drink too much sometimes.
[19:34.240 --> 19:38.560]  I'm pledging here on air, teetotaling. It's just the times are too incredibly serious. I don't
[19:38.560 --> 19:44.640]  want to end up like Boris Yeltsin, you know, being a leader completely wasted. But I mean,
[19:44.640 --> 19:49.520]  it's just crazy. So I've never seen anything like it. And it's just going to get more insane
[19:49.520 --> 19:53.120]  from here on out. He doesn't know the name of the Pentagon, doesn't know the name of the Secretary
[19:53.120 --> 20:01.600]  of Defense. Here it is. I just want to thank you both. And I want to thank the former general,
[20:01.600 --> 20:09.600]  I keep calling him general, my guy who runs that outfit over there. I want to make sure we thank
[20:10.160 --> 20:15.360]  the Secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we've just talked about,
[20:15.360 --> 20:21.600]  and for recommending these two women for promotion. Thank you all. May God bless you all,
[20:21.600 --> 20:28.480]  and may God protect our troops. Does it even know the name of the Pentagon
[20:29.440 --> 20:33.680]  or the Secretary of Defense or the women? He just says he's women. And look, it's women.
[20:34.480 --> 20:42.880]  It's women. Women. Oh, on International Women's Day, UN Day. Women. Look, we have women in charge.
[20:43.520 --> 20:46.720]  This is all about just getting rid of the military. The military they've planned within 10 years,
[20:46.720 --> 20:52.720]  be almost completely robot. And so to make the normal military dysfunctional,
[20:54.000 --> 21:01.440]  you see the demoralization program and process taking place. And all these little silly
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.840]  betas and all these little silly followers, the real alpha males aren't standing up saying no to
[21:05.840 --> 21:13.200]  the tyrants. And so they're recruiting all the betas to have the last watch on the human ship
[21:13.200 --> 21:19.200]  when the species is taken down. And it's all people that have pledged not to have children.
[21:19.760 --> 21:27.200]  That's the first step of these individuals is they don't have children because it's glamorized
[21:27.200 --> 21:32.960]  not to do so. And again, it's the post-human world. And it's a reclamation project. But before they
[21:32.960 --> 21:36.480]  can rebuild the earth, the globalist image, they have to get rid of us. Owen Schreuer,
[21:36.480 --> 21:43.920]  they're in the ATX. This is so beyond surreal, so beyond any dystopic novel. I could imagine the
[21:44.640 --> 21:50.400]  images of him not knowing the secretary of defense's name, Lloyd Austin,
[21:50.960 --> 21:55.840]  him not knowing the two women he's promoting. It just doesn't matter. You know, it's like,
[21:55.840 --> 21:59.360]  well, this guy's black and these people are women. I'm sure there might have been some women
[21:59.360 --> 22:03.520]  that were qualified. I'm sure there were some black guys that were qualified to be the
[22:03.520 --> 22:09.360]  secretary of defense. But he certainly wasn't it. He's a globalist who says the U.S. military's
[22:09.360 --> 22:13.440]  evil and racist. And we had a 60-day stand down to make sure bad white people aren't behaving
[22:13.440 --> 22:18.560]  badly. What he is is an order follower of the globalist. And now we have, I'll cover this coming
[22:18.560 --> 22:28.000]  up, major, major producers here in the United States of household products coming out. And they
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.920]  say they're banning the word normal. You see, because you can't have some benchmark of, you know,
[22:33.920 --> 22:39.600]  it's normal to have a wife or husband and have children. It's normal to want capitalism. It's
[22:39.600 --> 22:42.880]  normal to want the things that are successful. You know, it's normal to not only have cancer,
[22:42.880 --> 22:50.880]  it's normal to not want to be a robot. It's normal that ice freezes or water freezes a
[22:50.880 --> 22:54.720]  certain temperature. You know, it's normal to know what science and facts are. But instead,
[22:54.720 --> 23:03.680]  we see an absolute war on this. So here's the article up on infowars.com for everybody to see
[23:03.680 --> 23:14.400]  Unilever. Normal gets canceled as Unilever vows to drop word from all brands. And I guess that
[23:14.400 --> 23:22.080]  means, you know, normal means, oh, this is just a standard fabric softener or whatever or scentless.
[23:22.080 --> 23:26.960]  Well, maybe it's bad to say you don't have a scent. And again, people thought it was 10 years ago,
[23:26.960 --> 23:33.120]  a joke, when the left said, hey, we're going to ban the term mother and father and boy or girl on
[23:33.120 --> 23:39.600]  school entrance forms. And then now the US Congress just did it a few months ago. This is real.
[23:40.800 --> 23:46.000]  And this is a total attack on your identity as a human, as a man, as a woman. It's an attack on
[23:46.000 --> 23:51.760]  women's bathrooms and women's showers and women's reservations. And it's an attack on women's spaces
[23:51.760 --> 23:56.560]  and women's sports. And it's all done by these big corporate men saying, oh, we're here to empower
[23:56.560 --> 24:02.800]  women. No, they took women away from their children. They're destroying our culture. And then
[24:02.800 --> 24:07.760]  teaching women, oh, you're the elite now, because you don't like men. And it's billionaire and
[24:07.760 --> 24:12.880]  trillionaire men that control trillions, literally with the Communist Chinese running it all. And
[24:12.880 --> 24:18.880]  it's a total sick joke. And they show men as a masculine posing as a woman. Oh, if you're a
[24:18.880 --> 24:24.160]  man and act like a woman, now you're good. In fact, guys, I wanted that New York Times article.
[24:24.160 --> 24:27.920]  There were two of them there in the back of the truck. And they put it that little hatch
[24:28.640 --> 24:33.040]  under the deal. And I have them bring it up again, signing it at that rock room. Thanks. I want to
[24:33.040 --> 24:37.520]  show people two different New York Times that happen to come across. And every message is
[24:37.520 --> 24:42.480]  anti-human. Every message is satanic. We'll cover that next hour. I want to bring Owen Shroyer in.
[24:42.480 --> 24:46.160]  We've got some video next segment of what he ran into last night. We'll be talking about that
[24:46.160 --> 24:51.840]  first. But right now, Owen, what would you call the state of the world, the place we're in right
[24:51.840 --> 24:57.600]  now? Because we've crossed a Rubicon here, where now people that are awake are really awake and
[24:57.600 --> 25:02.640]  aren't denying anymore. But those that aren't awake are just descending into mass mind control.
[25:02.640 --> 25:08.560]  What would you call this period of time? Well, what we're seeing is this this faux liberal
[25:08.560 --> 25:14.720]  intellectual culture war declaring dominion over earth. And so that's why when you see them saying,
[25:14.720 --> 25:18.640]  oh, we're getting rid of the word normal. And they run this whole globalist ad campaign like,
[25:18.640 --> 25:22.720]  oh, all these ills of the world, don't worry, we're going to solve all of them because all our
[25:22.720 --> 25:28.160]  culture is superior. Our cultural culture will solve it. Of course, that's the big lie. It's just
[25:28.160 --> 25:33.680]  them going for their totalitarian angle, which is how they implement their policy. So that's all
[25:33.680 --> 25:38.560]  this really is. It's totalitarian. It's on a world scale. It's the one world government. And the
[25:38.560 --> 25:45.120]  people at the top are using the brainwashed good nature of quote unquote liberals to bring this
[25:45.120 --> 25:49.840]  in. Oh, you're fighting for women's rights. Oh, you're fighting against racism. And they feel
[25:49.840 --> 25:54.320]  good about themselves because they're finally doing something in their lives that they've been totally
[25:54.320 --> 25:58.160]  disenfranchised in. And they don't have upward prosperity because they've been shut down,
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.400]  but they don't know why. And so this is them declaring dominion over us, kind of like what
[26:02.400 --> 26:06.320]  we saw yesterday at this pro mask rally, where they just want you to wear the mask, they want
[26:06.320 --> 26:10.880]  you to take the vaccine, no more personal choice. And then when you talk about Biden,
[26:11.520 --> 26:14.800]  you know, the good news or bad news, I'm not sure how you want to weigh it,
[26:15.440 --> 26:20.880]  less than a thousand people in total tuned in to Biden's live speech yesterday that lasted
[26:20.880 --> 26:25.680]  less than 10 minutes remarks on international. Well, that was incredible. Everyone is rejecting
[26:25.680 --> 26:30.080]  the globalist poison. But now with them shutting down the world economy, they're going to dictate
[26:30.080 --> 26:34.480]  us to have food or anything. We've got to accept their poisons, their attack. And while they run
[26:34.480 --> 26:39.600]  death camps and suppress people, then you see the culture in the New York Times of just men as
[26:39.600 --> 26:45.200]  women, women as men. And it's just so obviously poison to destroy us. And they admit it's poison
[26:45.200 --> 26:49.200]  to destroy us. So we have a bunch of idiots running around on the deck of the ship as it stinks.
[26:49.200 --> 26:51.920]  I'm Alex Jones, info wars.com tomorrow is this day.
[26:55.280 --> 27:01.120]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit,
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.440]  do what you're told, and it's all going to pass. But if you study authoritarians,
[27:05.440 --> 27:08.880]  if you study the globalist, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is
[27:08.880 --> 27:13.200]  just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved. And because the
[27:13.200 --> 27:17.680]  globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move. And they are
[27:17.680 --> 27:22.240]  collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world
[27:22.240 --> 27:28.080]  that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[27:28.080 --> 27:32.800]  capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the
[27:32.800 --> 27:39.120]  flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and
[27:39.120 --> 27:45.360]  Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year long lockdowns that the UN
[27:45.360 --> 27:51.360]  and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money. And
[27:51.360 --> 27:56.800]  that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist. The general public has finally
[27:56.800 --> 28:02.160]  figured out why I'm upset. They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[28:02.160 --> 28:06.960]  They're trying to take over civilization and society and they depend on the public being
[28:06.960 --> 28:13.120]  ignorant. That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge. Knowledge is power. Like
[28:13.120 --> 28:18.880]  our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential
[28:18.880 --> 28:22.880]  vitamins and minerals. And that's why they don't want you to know about essential
[28:22.880 --> 28:26.800]  vitamins and minerals because it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[28:26.800 --> 28:31.680]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out there
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.720]  in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at infowarstore.com. And it's not just an incredible

[29:52.960 --> 30:04.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[30:04.800 --> 30:14.800]  you
[30:14.800 --> 30:15.280]  even off
[30:19.040 --> 30:21.600]  and give a pretty powerful speech with a pretty powerful article
[30:22.400 --> 30:27.760]  and we're going to be covering that next segment about Donald Trump and it's powerful.
[30:28.320 --> 30:30.480]  We shouldn't forget it. Most importantly, it's true.
[30:30.480 --> 30:37.520]  I'm Alex Jones, your host on this live Tuesday edition. Oh, Troyer is in the ATX
[30:38.320 --> 30:41.840]  and I want to get to what happened to Owen yesterday. There's a full hour of it.
[30:42.720 --> 30:47.040]  I watched probably 30 months of it last night, even though I had a lot of work to do. I stayed
[30:47.040 --> 30:54.320]  and I watched about half of it. It's pretty amazing. This group of Antifa calling themselves the
[30:55.040 --> 31:00.240]  Texas Socialist Restaurant Association. Of course, that's just a made up name. They're Antifa.
[31:00.240 --> 31:04.400]  Demanding everything stay closed and you talk about a bunch of weirdos.
[31:05.040 --> 31:09.360]  I mean, this is this is this is what George Soros can produce. But now they all cross their arms
[31:09.360 --> 31:14.560]  like they're in the gangs of New York and just strut around. This is truly pathetic.
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.440]  And they agree with, you know, CNN. We need to basically never reopen the country
[31:20.240 --> 31:24.640]  because they feel good when Communist China gets a leg up on us. We believe in this whole hopes
[31:24.640 --> 31:31.440]  separately. A lot of new products or a lot of products that have been sold out thankfully
[31:31.440 --> 31:36.960]  came back into stock because it's very, very hard to keep them in stock because of the COVID lockdowns.
[31:38.960 --> 31:42.880]  We have a new product we've been trying to put out for two years. I'm gonna leave it at that.
[31:43.840 --> 31:48.880]  And things down the process and things that have gone on. We finally had it all ready to come out.
[31:48.880 --> 31:54.880]  And then a couple people at the plant in Houston got COVID. No one was sick, but they test everybody.
[31:54.880 --> 31:59.840]  And then so was a chain reaction that, oh, then somebody else tested positive. Somebody else tested positive.
[31:59.840 --> 32:03.520]  And they basically just keep the place closed because it's everybody gets to stay home. And
[32:03.520 --> 32:07.680]  it's fun for a while till civilization collapses. No wonder why they're homeless later. But that
[32:07.680 --> 32:13.520]  won't matter to them because they won't put two and two together. And no, China never shut down.
[32:13.520 --> 32:19.520]  That was all just BS. Europe did shut down. Australia shut down. And it's a design to
[32:19.520 --> 32:23.520]  crepolis. And China has made more billionaires last year than all countries combined.
[32:24.640 --> 32:28.640]  And most people are saying that Europe and Australia is not open for business. And the U.S.
[32:28.640 --> 32:33.440]  isn't. They're permanently leaving. So they're reversing everything Trump and we the people did
[32:33.440 --> 32:38.480]  in just a year and a half of this crap. And it's just gonna get worse and worse because the average
[32:38.480 --> 32:43.520]  American thinks, oh, I can stay home and watch Netflix. Yeah, only for a little bit longer.
[32:43.520 --> 32:48.160]  And I know the audience here gets it and is active and cares, but you better reach out to your
[32:48.160 --> 32:54.560]  family. You better reach out to others because we have, I don't know, probably 30, 40 distributors
[32:54.560 --> 33:00.000]  and suppliers of products we sell. And all of them have trouble getting their base components
[33:00.000 --> 33:05.200]  because of this same phenomenon where people just shut their doors. I mean, you're talking about
[33:05.200 --> 33:10.720]  one person. A lot of these companies, all the lawyers say, test everyone. Remember what happened
[33:10.720 --> 33:15.680]  last year? Most of the meatpacking plant shut down because they would test a meatpacking plant of
[33:15.680 --> 33:23.600]  2000, 3000 people. And they'd say, oh, 65%, 70% was the headlines have COVID. A, the test is wrong.
[33:23.600 --> 33:28.240]  It's BS. And they say, actually, no one was sick, though. They were all asymptomatic because it's
[33:28.240 --> 33:32.960]  a fraud. It's a lie. Yeah, there's a real virus. They engineered because this was a simulant.
[33:32.960 --> 33:36.960]  They're going to release deadly versions of it in the future. You watch. And Gates has even said,
[33:36.960 --> 33:42.000]  oh, the terrorists have it. They're going to release really deadly one soon. Yes, this was
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.800]  a simulant to get the handcuffs on you to make sure you behave yourself well. We can get an A
[33:46.800 --> 33:51.280]  plus with Bill Gates, where he really released a super weapon right away. We got more of like a C
[33:51.280 --> 33:57.840]  minus in the U.S. Europe got an A plus. Australia got an A plus. Africa got an A plus. The different
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.240]  nations there. So believe me, wherever people lock down properly, you're going to get hit really
[34:02.240 --> 34:09.920]  hard. This is all a rollout. This is all a demonic plan. And so when we get these products back in,
[34:09.920 --> 34:13.760]  it's great because we get to fund ourselves and you get the products as well. So I get them
[34:13.760 --> 34:19.920]  while you can. Vitamins, fusion, all the vitamins, all the minerals. It is back in stock. It is high
[34:19.920 --> 34:26.400]  quality. And it's essential for everybody. And it funds the operation 50% off and free shipping.
[34:26.400 --> 34:30.240]  I've extended free shipping throughout this week, but then that's going to be it. And we have alpha
[34:30.240 --> 34:35.520]  power. This basically supermobile vitality, just the dried herb version, very, very strong, very,
[34:35.520 --> 34:40.320]  very potent for stamina, energy, libido. That is back in stock. We've been sold out for a long time.
[34:40.320 --> 34:45.360]  And a lot of other products, again, are available as well, like the krill oil, 40% off, but not
[34:45.360 --> 34:49.840]  much longer. That's a huge deal. 40% off. There's not much markup in the krill oil. So good for
[34:49.840 --> 34:53.920]  your body, your heart, your mind. It makes your sleep so much better, so good for your brain.
[34:53.920 --> 34:58.080]  I need to remember to take my fish oil, my krill oil. And when I do, my life is so much better.
[34:58.080 --> 35:02.800]  My skin is so much better. And I've got, again, the stamina, well, not the stamina really,
[35:02.800 --> 35:06.800]  but the libido of when I was like 16 years old. So it definitely goes together with all the great
[35:06.800 --> 35:11.600]  products like X2, also discounted in FullWarsHore.com. In other words, one product you ever tried,
[35:11.600 --> 35:15.440]  it should be X2 or X3, the good halogen. All right. Oh, and set this up. And then
[35:16.320 --> 35:25.920]  next segment we'll get in to more of CNN reporting that we were so lucky we're getting a small taste
[35:25.920 --> 35:32.080]  of freedom, just incredible condescension, just incredibly priming the pump for future total
[35:32.080 --> 35:37.920]  lockdowns. They admit they're already starting to cook up. But separately, you went down there
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.000]  yesterday for people that aren't going to go watch the full hour and five minute video at Bandai
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.760]  Video and who are on the radio and won't be able to see this five minute video. We're going to
[35:45.760 --> 35:50.800]  play next segment and then hit the Putin advisor article. That's so powerful. What was it like
[35:50.800 --> 35:55.040]  to be in amongst them? They're so stupid. They're so hateful. They're all white, by the way.
[35:55.040 --> 36:00.000]  Nothing against white folks, but anti-fun BLM in most places is all white. They're all the
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.920]  same weird super white pasty skin, glow-in-the-dark, really soft type dudes. But now we're seeing
[36:06.560 --> 36:10.720]  guys that aren't really big or tough, but they're crossing their arms or wearing tough guy outfits.
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.440]  They think they're in gangs of New York and they were flipping you off, getting in your face.
[36:15.440 --> 36:19.600]  They didn't like you not wearing a mask. Some of them put their hands on you. And they were
[36:19.600 --> 36:26.000]  really though, again, thought they were very powerful though. Well, it's very odd that you
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.680]  have this group of what they would like to consider themselves anti-establishment. I don't
[36:31.680 --> 36:35.120]  know. I guess they would declare themselves liberals, but they think they're anti-establishment.
[36:35.120 --> 36:38.560]  They think they're anti-government, but they're really pro-establishment working for the
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.800]  establishment, pro-government asking for more government with the face mask and the vaccines
[36:42.800 --> 36:45.840]  and the government to step in in their lives. That's what the whole thing is about.
[36:45.840 --> 36:51.440]  And so when I try to explain that to them, they obviously just don't talk or they result
[36:51.440 --> 36:55.600]  in cursing. There were a couple individuals that were there who spoke to me, but here's
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.640]  the real phenomenon, Alex. They really had a zero turnout for their event yesterday.
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.120]  They had about 16 speakers. That's all these Antifa people here are socialists,
[37:05.120 --> 37:09.360]  restaurant workers, whatever they want to call themselves. They had about 16 speakers,
[37:09.360 --> 37:14.320]  and then they had every local media there. So all the local major news networks there
[37:14.320 --> 37:19.600]  with their camera crews. So it was really a zero turnout event other than the media
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.600]  showing up and their speakers showing up. And then there was me and my crew and then a couple
[37:23.600 --> 37:29.040]  other Patriot groups that were out there who were documenting it as well. So it was really
[37:29.040 --> 37:35.760]  a zero turnout event. Now we had events, Alex, all year long, anti-mask events, open up Texas
[37:35.760 --> 37:41.600]  events, Trump was reelected events. Thousands of people show up, Alex. The local media never
[37:41.600 --> 37:45.920]  shows up. The local media never shows up. It's not a human interest story. It's like it never
[37:45.920 --> 37:49.680]  even happened. We get thousands of people to show up. We shut down the road sometimes. We have so
[37:49.680 --> 37:55.360]  many people. Local media never shows up. They have a zero turnout event except from the organizers
[37:55.360 --> 38:00.320]  that showed up to speak and the media. And somehow that's considered a story. Somehow
[38:00.320 --> 38:04.320]  that's considered what the news is going to cover. And they all ran their specials. I was
[38:04.320 --> 38:09.600]  getting texted from people here last night, hey, you made a clip of the pro-mask rally
[38:09.600 --> 38:12.960]  yesterday. So they acted like it was a big successful event for them. They acted like, oh,
[38:12.960 --> 38:17.680]  this huge success. Restaurant workers are scared. They don't want things to open up. They want the
[38:17.680 --> 38:21.440]  mask forever. They all want the vaccine before they go back to work and all of this stuff.
[38:21.440 --> 38:24.880]  No, they don't. This was a small contingent of people that-
[38:24.880 --> 38:28.560]  Well, let's be clear. Let's be clear. Everyone that I know that's still on Twitter or Facebook
[38:28.560 --> 38:33.280]  shows me, and I was shown this by security guys yesterday, their force-fed antifa
[38:33.920 --> 38:38.400]  people's profiles and, hey, be friends with this person. So whereas we're all banned and blocked,
[38:38.400 --> 38:42.160]  they force-feed Black Lives Matter. You know, they took over all the major platforms and put
[38:42.160 --> 38:47.200]  the black block at the top and said, listen to this black music. They mean globalist, communist
[38:47.200 --> 38:51.680]  establishment music. It is the megabanks. It is the corporations running death camps in China.
[38:51.680 --> 38:56.480]  It is the people exploiting us, running the lockdowns, making the biggest profits in history,
[38:56.480 --> 39:00.560]  bankrupting small farmers, bankrupting small businesses, killing old people in the nursing
[39:00.560 --> 39:06.240]  homes. It is the most monstrous, evil corporate establishment hidden behind this cloak of leftist
[39:06.240 --> 39:13.520]  wokeness. And then you go out and it's people literally in black voodoo outfits with top hats
[39:13.520 --> 39:19.840]  crossing their arms like they're some Marvel comic hero. I mean, these people are out of their freaking
[39:19.840 --> 39:25.920]  minds. And it's the same group that dressed up as the boogaloo's locally. I must say all the
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.680]  boogaloo's are bad. I'm saying there's the same group. We go out there. It's them in the boogaloo
[39:29.680 --> 39:36.640]  outfit. It's them in the Antifa outfit. You know, it's them wearing their 19th century outfits.
[39:36.640 --> 39:41.440]  And they just, and they're just ridiculous. And they're just, and again, they're trying to stop
[39:41.440 --> 39:44.960]  your speech, getting in your face. We're going to play a five minute excerpt of this when we come
[39:44.960 --> 39:50.320]  back on the other side. And then I promise, next hour, I will get to, at the very start,
[39:50.320 --> 39:53.760]  Putin's former chief of staff calls Trump a champion against the new world order. It's
[39:53.760 --> 40:00.160]  powerful. I'm going to read it on air. Lister's asking all the time, why do you have multiple
[40:00.160 --> 40:03.840]  multivitamins? Why do you have multiple high quality iodines? Why do you do that? Because
[40:03.840 --> 40:07.680]  different strokes for different folks. If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they
[40:07.680 --> 40:12.560]  say, Hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with
[40:12.560 --> 40:16.960]  deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[40:17.520 --> 40:21.840]  Boom, we did it. It's popular. It's X three. Is it better than X two? You decide it's different
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.720]  strokes for different folks. Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered
[40:26.720 --> 40:33.440]  pill sleeping. And that is down and out. It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they
[40:33.440 --> 40:37.840]  don't compete with each other. Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's
[40:37.840 --> 40:43.200]  40% off out of the gates at info or store.com and free shipping secure. You're down and out today.
[40:43.200 --> 40:46.800]  And while you're sleeping, you know, you're funding the info at the same time down and out.
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.960]  Exclusively available at info or store.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.680]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[40:59.680 --> 41:03.440]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[41:03.440 --> 41:07.600]  But let me tell you, the new world order is breathing down our neck. The big globalist
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.120]  publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[41:11.120 --> 41:15.600]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're
[41:15.600 --> 41:21.520]  listening to as well. At the same time, go to info or store.com while you still can and get a book,
[41:21.520 --> 41:27.200]  get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on
[41:27.200 --> 41:32.240]  air in the face of this thing. I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the
[41:32.240 --> 41:38.320]  globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks
[41:38.320 --> 41:43.200]  about the broadcast however you can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's
[41:43.200 --> 41:49.040]  lives every day at infowarstore.com. Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.640]  films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human
[41:54.640 --> 42:02.640]  and pro-god. Thank you so much. This is Greg Greese from infowars.com. I have many reasons
[42:02.640 --> 42:08.240]  to be grateful for working at info wars. One of them is that we support ourselves with great
[42:08.240 --> 42:14.640]  products that promote physical health and vitality. I've been using health supplements for years
[42:15.280 --> 42:22.160]  and I have found our products at infowarsstore.com to be the best, especially our vitamin mineral
[42:22.160 --> 42:28.480]  fusion. Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever
[42:28.480 --> 42:34.560]  actually did anything. I never felt much of an effect from other products, but I felt vitamin
[42:34.560 --> 42:41.120]  mineral fusion the first time I took it immediately. I love how it dissolves in water. I take it
[42:41.120 --> 42:48.640]  every day with my supper. It tastes great, feels great, and right now it's 50% off. It sells out
[42:48.640 --> 42:57.600]  fast, so stock up now at 50% off at infowarsstore.com. Vitamin mineral fusion at infowarsstore.com.
[42:57.600 --> 43:04.640]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak,
[43:04.640 --> 43:09.200]  making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the
[43:09.200 --> 43:15.120]  image of God, and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will. Being given
[43:15.120 --> 43:22.640]  free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system,
[43:22.640 --> 43:26.400]  and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of
[43:26.400 --> 43:31.120]  the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your life, your husband,
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.320]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune
[43:36.320 --> 43:43.280]  with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[43:43.280 --> 43:48.240]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in the system,
[43:48.240 --> 43:53.360]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God, and appreciate your consciousness,
[43:53.360 --> 43:56.960]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[43:59.200 --> 44:09.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:09.280 --> 44:20.800]  Welcome back.
[44:24.960 --> 44:29.120]  It is the Alex Jones show, and I'm extremely honored to be riding a shotgun with the one
[44:29.120 --> 44:34.080]  only Owen Shroyer, and I don't want to just make fun of these Antifa people
[44:34.080 --> 44:41.760]  who then lark as steampunks, or I guess folks from 100 years ago who were about to
[44:42.640 --> 44:48.400]  be involved in a gangland fight. It's just that they're posing as activists, they're posing as
[44:48.400 --> 44:53.360]  the resistance to the establishment. The entire globalist program, the entire media,
[44:53.360 --> 44:59.360]  the entire big tech system, Communist China is financing and funding Black Lives Matter in Antifa.
[44:59.360 --> 45:05.200]  So again, they call it the Socialist Restaurant Workers Association. It's just a made-up name,
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.920]  and they get to always have a new name. It's the same 10 or 15 people, and they show up,
[45:09.920 --> 45:15.680]  and they call for Austin to stay closed. When the governor, who never had the power to order
[45:15.680 --> 45:21.200]  all this to begin with, the law went back to legislature, raises the unconstitutional
[45:21.200 --> 45:28.000]  mask mandate, and the 100% occupancy. Oh, great. Half the businesses of Texas say they're never
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.640]  reopening. Half of them was the last number I saw. Great job, Abbott. And now you've got a
[45:32.640 --> 45:37.840]  bunch of other governors in Wyoming and Montana and all over the place I saw this morning.
[45:37.840 --> 45:43.600]  They're lifting the mandate 100%, but the businesses have been trained after a year plus,
[45:44.720 --> 45:51.120]  and the employees want their PCR tests. They want a NINI. They want to be test positive. They want
[45:51.120 --> 45:55.280]  to go home and watch Netflix. But I've talked to a lot of people. When they try to go back
[45:55.280 --> 46:01.520]  to their job, your job's not there anymore. Klaus Schwab did this. So again, we were a nation built
[46:01.520 --> 46:08.960]  on rugged individualism, but now we've gotten to the point where it's not good to be rugged. It's
[46:08.960 --> 46:14.720]  not good to be individuals. And I'll show you these two New York Times papers when we start
[46:15.840 --> 46:20.000]  the bottom of the hour next hour. But I want to get back to Owen Schreuer, then I promise.
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.680]  I said, I'll hit it this segment. I'm going to hit it six after Hooten's former chief of staff
[46:25.680 --> 46:29.600]  called Trump a champion against the New World War. Very powerful article. It's totally true.
[46:30.160 --> 46:36.560]  And again, it's everything I talk about. If you understand this, we'll defeat the New
[46:36.560 --> 46:43.200]  World War very quickly. So when I read this, I want this to sink into all of you. You have the
[46:43.200 --> 46:48.560]  same problem I have. You have the same blind spot I have. And I'm going to talk about that
[46:48.560 --> 46:54.400]  at six after. But please stay with us. I'm going to write a note here to cover my blind spot because
[46:54.400 --> 47:01.120]  this is our blind spot. Also, you shouldn't eat walnuts and try to talk after a break. I'm in
[47:01.120 --> 47:08.320]  my mouth, little pieces of blind spot. So I'll hit that start of the next hour. Going back to Owen
[47:08.320 --> 47:13.360]  Schreuer. Oh, and you got a five minute compilation of this yesterday. They got all this lavish media
[47:13.360 --> 47:19.920]  coverage, the 15 people dressed up in gangs of New York outfits, walking around trying to violate
[47:19.920 --> 47:23.360]  your First Amendment, telling us we all need to wear masks, which they were always wearing masks
[47:23.360 --> 47:28.000]  as Antifa to begin with. So again, it's all part of the shroud of death, the shroud of evil,
[47:28.000 --> 47:32.080]  the shroud that's going up over our faces that were dirty and bad. And, you know, we're like a
[47:32.080 --> 47:36.320]  bottle of whiskey or a bunch of porno magazines. We got to be put in a black bag. We've got to be
[47:36.320 --> 47:42.480]  disappeared. We've got to be ashamed of ourselves. Well, and it's again sad they had all the local
[47:42.480 --> 47:49.120]  news here, the late night local news running this story. Oh, you know, socialist restaurant board
[47:49.120 --> 47:55.440]  fighting for masks and vaccine rights. And nobody showed up. But we have events with thousands of
[47:55.440 --> 47:59.200]  people to show up in the local media acts like it doesn't even exist. But getting back to the
[47:59.200 --> 48:04.560]  actual event. So somebody wrote their talking point yesterday, 70% before 100%. And they're
[48:04.560 --> 48:10.800]  saying we must have 70% vaccinated before we can open 100%. So so that's them anti fascist
[48:10.800 --> 48:14.640]  declaring that they have the right to put a needle in your arm. And that's what they kept saying to
[48:14.640 --> 48:18.880]  you. They were all parroting the exact lines of the left. I mean, at least people with parents.
[48:19.840 --> 48:24.160]  Right. And so here's the irony, though, because this is what I foresee coming at least here in
[48:24.160 --> 48:30.400]  Austin, Alex, we're going to find out starting tomorrow, and then maybe give it a week or two,
[48:30.400 --> 48:35.520]  who's actually going to take off the mask and who's not, you're going to get emails from,
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.560]  you know, your gyms or whatever you remember, whatever else is going on, your work, okay,
[48:40.560 --> 48:44.240]  we're lifting the mask, you're going to have restaurants that you're not going to have to wear
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.160]  it to walk in the door and then take it off when you sit down in that nonsense. Oh, and my wife
[48:48.160 --> 48:52.000]  is getting all these emails of companies saying, don't worry, we're still going to wear the mask.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.560]  Right. And our nanny is getting them too. And I said, send every one of them a note saying,
[48:56.560 --> 49:00.160]  good, tell me when you're not going to do that. And that's when you'll get my business again.
[49:00.160 --> 49:04.800]  We need to stop complying with them, call their managers up and push back instead of
[49:04.800 --> 49:09.280]  15 leftists in every city speaking for us. Well, and here's what's going to happen. This is what
[49:09.280 --> 49:12.640]  I think is going to happen. You're going to have that kind of a culture war and there's going to
[49:12.640 --> 49:16.800]  be the restaurants and stuff that don't make you wear a mask. And then that's going to make these,
[49:16.800 --> 49:21.680]  these lazy bums want to play the victim again. And they're going to be mad that these other
[49:21.680 --> 49:24.960]  restaurants opened up and they don't have to wear masks. So they get to go to work and make money.
[49:24.960 --> 49:28.320]  And then they're not making money. So here's what I think is going to happen. They're going to start
[49:28.320 --> 49:35.280]  unleashing probably offensive violent attacks on the restaurants that lift the mask mandate and
[49:35.280 --> 49:39.440]  actually let you go have a meal or a beverage without wearing a mask. They'll start attacking
[49:39.440 --> 49:44.240]  those restaurants. But I agree with you. This is all malice psychology. Let's go to your five-minute
[49:44.240 --> 49:48.000]  boil down report that will come back and spend more time on this in the short segment and then
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.360]  write to this key speech and report by Putin's former chief of staff. Here it is.
[49:54.080 --> 49:59.280]  Percentage increase in death in the United States. I am not a scientist. So you haven't
[49:59.280 --> 50:04.320]  done your research. I'll tell you, it's zero percent, sir. The death rate has gone up zero percent
[50:04.320 --> 50:09.680]  in the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history. How is that? It's impossible. I think that is impossible.
[50:09.680 --> 50:14.240]  So this guy is the perfect example of a human that's really not even human anymore.
[50:14.800 --> 50:19.600]  His cell phone decides everything. His cell phone decides his politics. His cell phone decides
[50:19.600 --> 50:23.520]  God forbid he loses internet. What will you do then? I'd probably kill myself, bro.
[50:24.640 --> 50:27.920]  Well, at least you'd be saving the world from global warming, right? But see, this is what
[50:27.920 --> 50:31.520]  people do. This is what the liberals do to the truth right here. They just drown it out.
[50:31.520 --> 50:36.160]  They act like they can't hear it. They close their eyes. They close their ears. They don't
[50:36.160 --> 50:39.920]  want to know the truth. And this is why they're censoring everybody on the internet right now
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.480]  that speaks the truth because they just want the truth out of their lives. It's inconvenient for
[50:44.480 --> 50:49.280]  their lives. It's inconvenient for their totalitarianism. Are you pro-government or pro-freedom?
[50:49.280 --> 50:56.160]  That's a false equivalency. You can be both pro-government and pro-personal.
[50:56.160 --> 51:01.760]  The government restricts your freedom. Only to a point where it prevents you from... So you're
[51:01.760 --> 51:08.720]  pro-government? I am. Pro-government to a point that prevents people from harming each other.
[51:08.720 --> 51:12.720]  I'll give you credit. At least you're honest. You are pro-government. Yes, sir.
[51:12.720 --> 51:15.040]  So are you a communist? Do you want free stuff from the government?
[51:15.680 --> 51:20.560]  For certain things, yes. Like the prevention of disease? Excuse me, ma'am.
[51:20.560 --> 51:26.400]  Are you pro-government or pro-freedom? Pro-government or pro-freedom?
[51:27.360 --> 51:31.920]  Well, I'm pro. My body, my choice. So are you interested in women's rights?
[51:31.920 --> 51:35.280]  So my body, my choice. So I don't want to take a vaccine or wear a mask. Is that okay?
[51:36.320 --> 51:38.720]  I mean, I think if you want to die, that's fine with you.
[51:38.720 --> 51:41.840]  I have never worn a mask and I don't take any vaccines. I'm still alive.
[51:41.840 --> 51:46.240]  But you can get the f*** away from me because you don't have a mask on and I do.
[51:46.240 --> 51:48.640]  But the mask protects you, right? Doesn't the mask protect you?
[51:48.640 --> 51:50.960]  It doesn't protect you.
[51:57.120 --> 51:59.920]  By the way, they were playing this music to blare it over Owen.
[51:59.920 --> 52:01.280]  That's not us playing that music.
[52:01.280 --> 52:07.920]  What Ewok is trying to do is train people how to become union organizers in their workplace.
[52:07.920 --> 52:08.480]  Ewok.
[52:08.480 --> 52:09.200]  To...
[52:09.200 --> 52:10.240]  Communists.
[52:10.240 --> 52:12.080]  They just want to be communists, right?
[52:12.080 --> 52:14.880]  Sure. Communism f***ing rules, dude.
[52:16.560 --> 52:17.280]  I'm going to end...
[52:17.280 --> 52:18.720]  That's why everybody's trying to get out of the comments.
[52:18.720 --> 52:19.680]  Come here.
[52:19.680 --> 52:24.000]  You know, current marks, workers of the world unite.
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.120]  We have nothing to lose but our fame.
[52:29.120 --> 52:29.840]  Let this guy run.
[52:29.840 --> 52:32.160]  As we beg to put the mask on our feet.
[52:32.160 --> 52:34.720]  You're too small, by the way.
[52:34.720 --> 52:35.440]  No, stop.
[52:36.640 --> 52:38.160]  But you know what's great?
[52:38.160 --> 52:39.680]  Those are called muscles.
[52:39.680 --> 52:41.200]  If you worked out, you may know something.
[52:42.880 --> 52:44.320]  Tom, that's plenty, baby.
[52:44.320 --> 52:45.760]  My brain's bigger than yours, too.
[52:45.760 --> 52:47.600]  The mask is actually an IQ test.
[52:47.600 --> 52:48.160]  You failed.
[52:48.160 --> 52:52.960]  Did our sacrifice result in any action from our governor?
[52:52.960 --> 52:54.960]  Yeah, you destroyed your own prosperity.
[52:54.960 --> 52:56.640]  The government owes you nothing.
[52:56.640 --> 52:59.760]  You already battling food and you're going to get the f*** away from me.
[52:59.760 --> 53:00.880]  Yeah!
[53:00.880 --> 53:02.080]  Hey, pause.
[53:02.080 --> 53:02.880]  Take someone.
[53:04.880 --> 53:05.600]  Hey, pause, guys.
[53:06.240 --> 53:07.520]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[53:07.520 --> 53:08.720]  We're going to come back and put the rest of this.
[53:08.720 --> 53:14.720]  But the United Nations admits that 200 and what's the latest number, 87 million people
[53:14.720 --> 53:16.720]  are starving on the verge of death.
[53:16.720 --> 53:20.720]  Double the number of people died last year of starvation, something like 35 million,
[53:20.720 --> 53:23.200]  said of the usual 15, 16, 17 million.
[53:23.200 --> 53:26.320]  They admit that billions could starve and that the lockdowns were bad.
[53:26.320 --> 53:30.400]  After the U.N. recommends it and does it, then they got heat and they went,
[53:30.400 --> 53:35.360]  oh, okay, yeah, but still the nation states are getting IMF and World Bank money.
[53:35.360 --> 53:38.080]  They actually continue the lockdowns in Africa and areas of Latin America,
[53:38.080 --> 53:42.800]  causing total collapse in giant migrant groups to surge who were then organized
[53:42.800 --> 53:46.800]  into U.N. invasion forces and brought in here and then politically brainwashed
[53:46.800 --> 53:49.280]  against what's left of western republics.
[53:49.280 --> 53:53.680]  That's the globalist using the collapse of the third world they did to cause mass starvation
[53:53.680 --> 53:56.640]  than usual refugees as a weapon against us.
[53:56.640 --> 54:00.800]  Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us, a global food crisis looms.
[54:00.800 --> 54:03.280]  That was back, what, in April of last year.
[54:03.280 --> 54:07.680]  So that's almost a year ago, that is 11 months ago.
[54:07.680 --> 54:10.240]  I'm going from memory, sent in March or April, that article.
[54:10.240 --> 54:13.120]  In the New York Times of all places.
[54:13.120 --> 54:15.840]  So they're going, we've got a looming food crisis.
[54:15.840 --> 54:17.200]  Keep everything you hear.
[54:17.200 --> 54:19.520]  We've got a looming food crisis.
[54:19.520 --> 54:21.360]  Let's keep the economy shut.
[54:21.360 --> 54:24.960]  Which is what Klaus Schwab wants to do to starve the third world to death,
[54:24.960 --> 54:27.200]  you dumb, stupid witch.
[54:27.200 --> 54:30.880]  You get five university degrees, you've got a job as a bartender,
[54:30.880 --> 54:31.760]  nothing against you.
[54:31.760 --> 54:35.840]  You want to stay shut, but you're talking about starvation when you're the people
[54:35.840 --> 54:37.040]  that starve everyone.
[54:37.040 --> 54:39.120]  Move to North Korea if you love communism so much.
[54:39.120 --> 54:40.400]  You dimwit.
[54:40.400 --> 54:42.320]  Power number two straight ahead.
[54:42.320 --> 54:44.880]  Don't let anybody tune in now or roll over to die.
[54:45.760 --> 54:48.880]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars.
[54:48.880 --> 54:52.320]  And we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love,
[54:52.320 --> 54:53.760]  especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[54:53.760 --> 54:54.960]  It is down and out.
[54:54.960 --> 54:56.720]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[54:56.720 --> 54:59.680]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[54:59.680 --> 55:02.720]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[55:02.720 --> 55:05.360]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[55:05.360 --> 55:08.960]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[55:08.960 --> 55:14.000]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[55:16.640 --> 55:19.680]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[55:19.680 --> 55:22.080]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[55:22.080 --> 55:25.840]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[55:25.840 --> 55:26.560]  It's incredible.
[55:26.560 --> 55:29.120]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[55:29.120 --> 55:31.520]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.
[55:31.520 --> 55:35.360]  Get yours today, down and out exclusively at M4WareStore.com.
[55:35.360 --> 55:39.440]  40% off out of the gates with free shipping while supplies last.

[55:47.200 --> 55:51.760]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be,
[55:52.320 --> 55:55.520]  you have to understand that this is all a test.
[55:55.520 --> 56:00.480]  This experience, this mindfulness planet is a reckoning.
[56:00.480 --> 56:05.360]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension,
[56:06.080 --> 56:09.680]  so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[56:10.320 --> 56:11.760]  And it really does come down to that.
[56:11.760 --> 56:15.200]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are,
[56:15.200 --> 56:19.680]  look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[56:20.240 --> 56:23.040]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[56:23.840 --> 56:29.520]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[56:29.520 --> 56:33.360]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture
[56:33.360 --> 56:39.520]  in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[56:39.520 --> 56:42.320]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in bed
[56:42.320 --> 57:00.000]  because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[57:12.320 --> 57:16.560]  The hour plus unedited insanity of the 15 or so.
[57:18.400 --> 57:23.760]  Gangs of New York wannabes, Larpers, Antifa dudes walk around like this, flexing their
[57:23.760 --> 57:29.600]  muscles, saying we are the socialist restaurant workers and we don't want to reopen.
[57:31.280 --> 57:32.320]  Wow, these are great people.
[57:33.360 --> 57:37.280]  And again, here's this woman talking about food shortages.
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.760]  And how terrible it is when it's the lockdown ding dong that's causing it.
[57:41.760 --> 57:44.160]  And we'll get Owen's take on it here it is.
[57:48.480 --> 57:55.760]  What Ewok is trying to do is train people on how to become union organizers in their workplace.
[57:59.360 --> 58:02.160]  Sure, communist and f***ing rules, dude.
[58:02.160 --> 58:11.280]  I'm going to end from a quote from, you know, Carl Marx, workers of the world unite.
[58:11.280 --> 58:14.480]  We have nothing to lose but our fame.
[58:17.120 --> 58:19.600]  As we beg to put the mass on our face.
[58:20.320 --> 58:21.600]  You're still too small.
[58:25.520 --> 58:26.960]  Those are called muscles.
[58:26.960 --> 58:28.480]  If you worked out, you may know something.
[58:28.480 --> 58:33.040]  My brain's bigger than yours, too.
[58:33.760 --> 58:35.440]  The mask is actually an IQ test.
[58:35.440 --> 58:36.000]  You failed.
[58:36.000 --> 58:40.960]  Did our sacrifice result in any action from our governor?
[58:40.960 --> 58:42.960]  Yeah, you destroyed your own prosperity.
[58:42.960 --> 58:44.480]  The government owes you nothing.
[58:44.480 --> 58:56.160]  You're already battling food insecurity.
[58:56.160 --> 59:00.160]  Come on.
[59:00.160 --> 59:00.160]  A little bit.
[59:03.760 --> 59:05.280]  Did that just threaten a woman?
[59:06.160 --> 59:07.600]  Wow, you threatened a woman.
[59:08.320 --> 59:09.200]  Watertower.
[59:09.200 --> 59:12.080]  Now that you guys have finally subdued your communist energy,
[59:12.080 --> 59:15.000]  I want you to know that there was no pandemic.
[59:15.000 --> 59:18.760]  I know that's shocking that the television would lie to you, but go look at the death
[59:18.760 --> 59:20.400]  rate in the United States.
[59:20.400 --> 59:24.920]  The death rate in the United States of America did not go up a single percent.
[59:24.920 --> 59:26.320]  My body, my choice.
[59:26.320 --> 59:30.560]  If we don't want a vaccine and we don't want to wear a mask, that's our body.
[59:30.560 --> 59:31.560]  That's our choice.
[59:31.560 --> 59:33.760]  But all of a sudden, you're against my body, my choice.
[59:33.760 --> 59:38.760]  So it seems like all your other political policies, all your other political opinions
[59:38.760 --> 59:42.200]  are all hypocritical and all double-sided.
[59:42.200 --> 59:46.120]  If you look at the CDC's numbers for flu and pneumonia, they went down to zero.
[59:46.120 --> 59:52.920]  And if you look at the number of comorbidity deaths from COVID, it's 80 percent.
[59:52.920 --> 59:53.920]  Please back it up.
[59:53.920 --> 59:54.920]  Thirty seconds.
[59:54.920 --> 59:55.920]  This is the end.
[59:55.920 --> 59:56.920]  It's very important.
[59:56.920 --> 1:00:01.200]  He's giving them actual admitted numbers that are deadly accurate.
[1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:04.200]  And they're just screaming and yelling, hoping he can't be hurt.
[1:00:04.200 --> 1:00:05.200]  Their whole world.
[1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:12.480]  I mean, when I go out to any event now, they'll have anti-flit with black, like tar paper.
[1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:16.680]  And they try to put it up and block me and block others and then beat up people in wheelchairs.
[1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:19.120]  I mean, they are the villains.
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:27.080]  And again, they're such weird larpers that they named it their communist group, the Ewoks.
[1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:32.040]  And they want to unionize private businesses and bankrupt the snot out of them.
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:35.840]  It's all directed by Confucius Institutes of our universities.
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:37.040]  They know how to shut us down.
[1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:43.440]  And China is consolidating power with corporations, even sabotage, which is an old French term
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:45.480]  from when they actually had a workers' movement.
[1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:51.040]  They were sticking sandals in the Industrial Revolution in years, meaning sabos, sandal.
[1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:53.720]  That's what I was told when I read that.
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:54.720]  And I mean, this is insane.
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:55.720]  You're not the Ewoks.
[1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:58.000]  You're the empire.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Let's explain that.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.840]  We're using cheesy Star Wars analogies.
[1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:03.040]  Show the Death Star.
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:04.440]  That's Klaus Schwab.
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:05.440]  That's Bill Gates.
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:07.280]  That's who you're promoting.
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:08.280]  Their deals.
[1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:09.280]  Okay.
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:10.280]  We are the Ewoks.
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:12.400]  In fact, I have as much hair on my back as an Ewok.
[1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:14.560]  I am the rightful Ewok.
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:15.560]  Let's finish.
[1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:16.560]  Owen's Club heard us.
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:17.560]  A percent.
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:18.560]  My body, my choice.
[1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:23.880]  If we don't want a vaccine and we don't want to wear a mask, that's our body.
[1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:24.880]  That's our choice.
[1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:27.080]  But all of a sudden, you're against my body, my choice.
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:33.600]  So it seems like all your other political policies, all your other political opinions are all hypocritical
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:34.600]  and all double-sided.
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:39.600]  If you look at the CDC's numbers for flu and pneumonia, they went down to zero.
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:44.480]  And if you look at the number of co-morbidity deaths from COVID, it's 80 percent.
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:50.680]  Eighty percent of COVID deaths were cancer, leukemia, bone disease, obesity, heart failure.
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:51.680]  All right.
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:02:03.920]  Look, I've proven that M-Full Wars information is some of the best in the world.
[1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:06.360]  It's just absolutely on target.
[1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:09.440]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:10.800]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:14.880]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F. Kennedy
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:15.880]  was right.
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:18.760]  A raising tide raises all ships.
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:24.600]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at infowarstore.com are

[1:02:52.640 --> 1:03:12.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:20.640]  We are joined by a very serious thought criminal, Lauren Witzke.
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:24.440]  Again, this lady is a terrible person.
[1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:27.240]  Wait till you hear what she's done.
[1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:32.200]  Well, she has been critical of pedophiles and she's been outspoken, so she's been banned
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:36.000]  on Twitter and they said it's official.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.680]  You cannot call pedophiles demonic.
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:40.080]  It's a medical condition.
[1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:41.080]  That's how it begins.
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:45.520]  It's a medical condition, they want to grab your child out of the back of your yard and
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:48.400]  take them and rape them and kill them.
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:52.360]  So Lauren joins us and a very, very talented lady.
[1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:56.160]  I saw when she was running for the Senate at the most votes ever in the state she's in
[1:03:56.160 --> 1:04:00.480]  in modern history as a Republican and then I saw her on with Tom Pappert and I was like,
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:01.920]  oh my gosh, let's get her on.
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:03.320]  That's awesome.
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:07.960]  And she is a spokeswoman for Hold the Line PAC and former Republican nominee for the
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:14.040]  U.S. Senate in 2020, Lauren smashed the record for most Republican votes in a Senate candidacy
[1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:17.240]  in Delaware history outside of politics.
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:22.680]  Addiction recovery is her passion and she is an active volunteer in the recovery ministry.
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:28.360]  Hold the line PAC.com and she's fighting of course also the transgender is trying to take
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:35.600]  over women's sports and all that, but really the giant pedophile armies that have declared
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:40.960]  their occupation of the planet and the ownership of our children for me, the whole transgender
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:44.920]  thing targeting little boys, mainly autistic little boys all over the world trying to sterilize
[1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:46.920]  them, trying to sexualize them.
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:47.920]  It's all part of this.
[1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:51.440]  And when we get to the next segment, I got two copies of the New York Times that were
[1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:52.440]  in my hotel the other day.
[1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:58.320]  I was there for two days and it's just all men as women sexualizing little kids.
[1:04:58.320 --> 1:04:59.760]  It's like an alternate universe.
[1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:03.240]  It just shows that this cult was in control.
[1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:06.960]  And so Lauren, thank you for joining us and I want Shroyer's riding shotgun in studio
[1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:07.960]  in Austin.
[1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:12.840]  He'll be popping it as well, but we salute your work and while you are banned for criticizing
[1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:15.440]  pedophilia that this is a new low.
[1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:20.200]  Yeah, I know who would have thought 10 years ago that we'd be even having to have this
[1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:26.360]  discussion, you know, now Twitter has changed their terms of service to accommodate pedophiles.
[1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:32.200]  But if you call pedophilia or degeneracy out for what it is, demonic, you instantly
[1:05:32.200 --> 1:05:33.840]  get banned.
[1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:37.600]  Christian values are no longer welcome as public opinion.
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:41.360]  They're doing everything they can to shut down Christianity and let me tell you something.
[1:05:41.360 --> 1:05:43.440]  This was always their end goal.
[1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:45.560]  It was always about the children.
[1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:46.560]  And guess what?
[1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:50.520]  The culture war is here and they're coming for your children and they will do everything
[1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:51.720]  they can to silence you.
[1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:55.160]  They will do everything they can to get you to back down.
[1:05:55.160 --> 1:06:00.360]  But I want to encourage your listeners do not back down because like I said, their angle
[1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:01.360]  is the children.
[1:06:01.360 --> 1:06:02.360]  They've always been the children.
[1:06:02.360 --> 1:06:06.120]  The only thing I care about is winning and saving babies.
[1:06:06.120 --> 1:06:09.840]  So you know, I will continue to fight and the only thing that they did by silencing
[1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:11.760]  me was take me off.
[1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:15.520]  So I'm ready to go and I'm ready to keep fighting and I'm ready to leave the charge
[1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:18.440]  in this new culture war that is long overdue.
[1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:24.520]  Well, what's amazing is I followed your story the last year or so.
[1:06:24.520 --> 1:06:28.200]  If you would have run in a tight district, you would have won.
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:33.880]  I mean, you got record votes, so you ran a very, very uphill battle and just did an
[1:06:33.880 --> 1:06:34.880]  amazing job.
[1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:39.320]  So even though you lost, the process of struggle is making you stronger.
[1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:40.320]  Talk about yourself.
[1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:41.680]  Talk about what you witnessed.
[1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:44.960]  And then let's get into what specifically happened on Twitter in this latest outreach.
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:45.960]  Right.
[1:06:45.960 --> 1:06:46.960]  Yeah.
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:50.640]  So I am, it's no secret to anybody that I am in active recovery.
[1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:55.080]  I struggled with heroin and methamphetamine addiction all through my 20s.
[1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:59.720]  I found myself in a situation I never thought I'd be in, you know, at one point I was a
[1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:03.560]  low ball drug runner working for Mexican cartels.
[1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:09.040]  You know, I was in the pits of hell and even still when I was there, God met me there.
[1:07:09.040 --> 1:07:11.040]  You know, I went through a program, changed my life.
[1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:15.400]  I went through a Christian program, you know, I rebuilt my character from the inside out.
[1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:21.760]  Now I do everything I can to fight for recovery solutions, you know, in a nation that is crippled
[1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:22.760]  by addiction.
[1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:27.800]  You know, we have to start talking about the issue of the opioid epidemic.
[1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:32.720]  You know, also some things I witnessed, you know, this whole thing yet again, open borders,
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:34.200]  it's about the children.
[1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:39.840]  You know, these cartels, they smuggle in children, they sell their children to these people and
[1:07:39.840 --> 1:07:41.320]  it becomes human trafficking.
[1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:46.880]  You know, it's all intertwined, opioid epidemic, open borders, sex trafficking, going after
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:47.880]  the children.
[1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:53.240]  I'm really passionate, I really have a heart for protecting America's children.
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:58.000]  So you know, my entire life that I've walked through, everything that I've walked through
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:04.480]  became my testimony, but it also became my platform and I fought for it and we did really
[1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:05.480]  well.
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:06.480]  It's my first time running.
[1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:11.400]  We beat the establishment GOP endorsed candidate who was a lawyer, well-established lawyer in
[1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:12.520]  the state of Delaware.
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:14.200]  We beat him handedly.
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:19.520]  And on election day, we were buried in mail and ballot votes, 165,000 mail and ballot
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:24.840]  votes already Chris Coons had in the door, but we still put up one heck of a fight and
[1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:25.840]  I'm not done.
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:27.720]  You know, I'm just getting started.
[1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:31.520]  Now I'm focused on restoring election integrity because we will never win again.
[1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:36.920]  We will not have a prayer in 2022 or 2024 if we do not get election reform.
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:38.720]  So I'm going to save Georgia right now.
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:45.200]  We are pushing through a bill that gets rid of vote by mail that requires voter ID, bans
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:50.160]  the ballot drop boxes and it's just a great bill that will restore election integrity.
[1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:57.560]  It will cut Stacey Abrams off at the knees and we're going to force Brian Kent to sign
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:08:58.560]  it.
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:02.560]  We have to put pressure on him because like I said, I only care about winning.
[1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:08.520]  So we have to start holding our elected officials accountable in order to get election reform
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:11.560]  and settle for nothing less than free and fair elections.
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:16.200]  So that is what I'm focusing on now after I get election integrity, free and fair elections,
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:20.200]  which is I will not stop until I do then I may consider running again.
[1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:24.600]  However, you know, I'm really doing the fight on the ground to push through legislation
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:32.600]  on the state level to achieve election integrity, you know, sorry, go ahead.
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:35.600]  No, no, no, no, go ahead.
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:40.920]  I was going to say your story is beautiful and it's what God's all about.
[1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:41.920]  It's what America is all about.
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:45.120]  It's what freedom is all about and, you know, none of us are perfect.
[1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:48.920]  What we don't need is these fake lawyers up there that claim they're all have never
[1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:49.920]  done anything in their life.
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:54.800]  But in truth, they're a bunch of absolute monsters behind the scenes and you're so outspoken,
[1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:57.000]  so well-spoken and they're really scared of you.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.880]  A lot of other really great women I'm noticing that are stepping up and running against the
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:03.280]  whole globalist agenda.
[1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:08.280]  Right, yeah, and I mean, this is globalism versus nationalism.
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:11.720]  Who would have thought that just wanting to secure the borders and making life easier
[1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:16.640]  for American families is such a controversial topic now?
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:20.480]  You know, this should just be the standard and be the norm and we as a Republican party,
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:29.360]  we as a political entity have allowed subversive people to come into our party and allow us
[1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:31.640]  to make compromises and enough is enough.
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:34.040]  I know what compromise gets me.
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:39.000]  I know if I give the enemy an inch, he takes the whole thing and today we are facing that.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:43.400]  He is about to take the whole thing, so it's about time that people man up.
[1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:44.400]  I shouldn't have to do this.
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:45.400]  I'm a girl.
[1:10:45.400 --> 1:10:48.400]  You know, I should be home making babies, you know, that's what I should be doing.
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:49.920]  However, you know, here I am.
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:55.920]  I'm having to fight because many Christian men, many of the strong men within our political
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:01.320]  party are too busy reading green eggs and ham doing a live stream or getting a hot take
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:02.320]  on Fox News.
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:08.520]  They have done nothing for us and I'm sick and tired of it and, you know, I just speak
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:11.880]  my mind, you know, what are they going to do to me?
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:13.400]  There's nothing else they can take from me.
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:14.480]  They have silenced my voice.
[1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:16.520]  They put me on the domestic terrorist list.
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:22.520]  I can't even fly without being very, very searched and very, very screened, you know,
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:27.920]  and this is where I'm at, but it is worth it and we need more people to step up, you
[1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:33.640]  know, because the future of our country is at stake, my generation and the younger generation,
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:35.520]  their future is at stake.
[1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:40.880]  And you know, this all started when we started making compromises, so I know the importance
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:47.000]  of not compromising standing firm in what you believe in and not apologizing.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:51.440]  We do way too much apologizing and we are way too fearful of what the left is going
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:54.920]  to call us when they will never vote for us anyway.
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:59.080]  These people are our enemies and we need to start treating them as so.
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:04.040]  Lauren Witzke is our amazing guest and again, I saw a clip somewhere on the news when she
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:07.680]  was running in Delaware, some of the things she did, but what a charismatic, dynamic lady
[1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:09.560]  and her own shroyers got points.
[1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:11.040]  He wants to go over it as well.
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:17.120]  He's with us for two more segments and then I'll hit the Putin advisor letter that I promised
[1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:23.080]  that I would get to, but when we come back, I want to speak to children becoming a commodity
[1:12:23.080 --> 1:12:27.400]  with the left, the fact that under Obama and now under Biden, even the Senate report admits
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:34.880]  thousands of children replaced with smugglers, many of which used in the horrible sex stands.
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:37.360]  That's mainline news.
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:39.840]  And so really, they are trafficking in our children.
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:44.480]  I want to just finish up with Twitter banning you and I want to see if you can find or send
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:45.480]  this because I've never seen a screenshot.
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:50.000]  We have an article, folks, at infowars.com, so we can pull that up where she got named
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  for calling it demonic.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:54.560]  This is just incredible, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[1:12:54.560 --> 1:12:56.960]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:12:58.880]  It's very bittersweet.
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:02.040]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:03.760]  a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:07.720]  I care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility,
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.600]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:13.840]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:17.480]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:21.080]  the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:25.880]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowars.com, they're great products, plus
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:27.280]  they fund the operation.
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:30.160]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:31.160]  Do they fund freedom?
[1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:32.480]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:37.160]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:38.960]  up and looking for truth.
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:40.600]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:44.040]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:47.960]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word, download everything
[1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:51.480]  we've done, you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the
[1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:54.920]  air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:58.640]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:01.240]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:02.240]  Why do you do that?
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:04.520]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:08.880]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:12.920]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:16.000]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:17.160]  Boom, we did it.
[1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:18.160]  It's popular.
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:19.160]  It's X3.
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:20.160]  Is it better than X2?
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:21.160]  You decide.
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:22.160]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:27.600]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:29.000]  And that is down and out.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:33.920]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:38.680]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[1:14:38.680 --> 1:14:41.160]  at m4store.com and free shipping.
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:44.000]  Whether you're down and out today and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  m4 at the same time.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:57.920]  Down and out exclusively available at m4store.com or 40% off and for shipping.
[1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:15.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:29.960]  All right, we are back live and I'm Alex Jones, your host, Lauren Witzke, is our guest, hold
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:30.960]  the line, pack.com.
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:31.960]  She's like info wars.
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:32.960]  You got to go to her URL.
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:33.960]  That's because she's a bona fide patriot and is effectively fighting the enemy.
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:34.960]  And how dare her call pedophiles, monsters.
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:35.960]  How dare she call them demonic?
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:45.240]  No, no, the New York Times and vice and salons say they're actually good people.
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:48.720]  So, let's get into what you actually got banned for.
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:50.840]  They can put that info or article back on screen.
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:51.840]  That'd be great.
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:52.840]  Yeah, there it is.
[1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:53.840]  There is what she had to say.
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:54.840]  They have a screenshot.
[1:15:54.840 --> 1:15:55.840]  Demonic.
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:03.080]  Twitter bans Lauren Witzke for criticizing trans women who says little girls are tinky.
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:06.440]  And when you go look at all these different tweets and Facebooks, these people, they're
[1:16:06.440 --> 1:16:11.560]  obsessed with children and they want sexual access to your children, just like the new
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:17.480]  deputy head of health and human services that disgusting looking man with the curly hair
[1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:18.480]  that calls himself a woman.
[1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:24.000]  I mean, I'm used to an old horror movies like silence the lamps, the serial killer thinks
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:29.680]  he's a woman, the serial killer helper Buffalo Bill, kind of the Wrenfield type.
[1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:33.600]  I mean, how many old movies is the serial killer thinks he's a woman?
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:37.640]  And I mean, hell, in psycho, he dresses up like a woman when he's killing people.
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:42.440]  I mean, these are like dudes that want your son's genitals.
[1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:45.560]  And if they can't have sex with them, I guess, you know, they want to chop them off.
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:47.280]  And that's, that's what this whole movement is.
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:48.840]  And it's so out of the open.
[1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:52.000]  And listen, I got two New York times this year while you're talking, I'm going to hold
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:57.880]  up some of this literally dozens of pages of New York times with what looks like underage
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:01.240]  boys dressed like girls, all emaciated like they're dying.
[1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:05.200]  So I'm, I'm ranting here, Lauren, tell us about how you got banned and why?
[1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:06.200]  Yeah.
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:10.680]  So it started last week, I got in a fight with Richard Grinnell, that subversive pervert
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:15.240]  within our Republican Party for spotlighting transgenderism at CPAC.
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:19.880]  You know, we are the party of opposing gay marriage, we're the party of traditional family
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:20.880]  values.
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:25.680]  And what we have allowed is the LGBTQ lobby and their donors to come in and infiltrate
[1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:26.680]  our party.
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:33.120]  So I called him out on it last week, the neocons and the fake conservatives, the gay conservatives
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:34.920]  all mass reported me.
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:39.200]  And I ended up surviving that mass reporting speech to feel.
[1:17:39.200 --> 1:17:44.000]  However, calling pedophile demonic is what got me banned.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:52.520]  Calling a pedophile transgender woman who or man, whatever it is, a demonic for openly
[1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:56.440]  suggesting that little girls aren't princesses and they're actually kinky.
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:59.760]  And they, if you get abused in the bathroom, it's because they wanted it.
[1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:01.360]  You know, that is absolutely demonic.
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:04.600]  And we allowed this to come into our party and happen.
[1:18:04.600 --> 1:18:08.800]  You know, we, they called us crazy 10 years ago and we talked about the slippery slope.
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:11.840]  Well, here's the deal that we were right.
[1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:16.080]  The slippery slope is here and this is where it's gotten us and we can't even speak out
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:19.720]  against it and call it out for exactly what it is.
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:23.040]  This is a demonic movement and this is a spiritual battle.
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:29.080]  And you know, if you cannot handle being told that, you know, being called out for what
[1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:33.840]  you are and you have to be silenced, it means we're right and we're right over the target.
[1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:37.920]  I mean, look at that video, that's absolutely just, who does that?
[1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:41.520]  You know, they're operating in some kind of darkness that we shouldn't even have any
[1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:46.320]  association with and if anybody stands up against it, they shut you down.
[1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:48.520]  So we as Christians need to come together.
[1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:49.520]  This is the end goal.
[1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:55.120]  This is where we're at and start going on offense and start taking our country back from these
[1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:56.120]  pedophiles.
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:58.080]  You know, Twitter now allows.
[1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:05.600]  They're called a minor attracted, minor attracted individuals are allowed to be on Twitter and
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:11.960]  communicate with each other as long as they're witnessing is the coming out of the international
[1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:12.960]  pedophile movement.
[1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:18.000]  And then the media, whenever Trump was busting all these different traffic operations would
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.440]  say it was a conspiracy theory and it didn't exist.
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:21.440]  And we see the sexualization.
[1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:26.180]  I mean, I've got the New York Times here and literally all these magazines, all these
[1:19:26.180 --> 1:19:31.040]  papers just fell out of it when I got it at the hotel and it was all men dressed as women,
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:33.840]  hundreds and hundreds of pages, different catalogs, different articles.
[1:19:33.840 --> 1:19:38.400]  And then in the paper, it just shows this and then it shows women as men.
[1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:44.440]  And again, men as emaciated girls and then it had articles about starving Latin Americans
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:46.280]  and girls and slavery.
[1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:48.240]  And it's all like a weird snuff film.
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:49.880]  They're getting off on this.
[1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:52.840]  This is what New York elitism has produced.
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:55.760]  And I want to be clear, I've been more of a libertarian over the years.
[1:19:55.760 --> 1:20:00.840]  I'm a Christian, but I don't hate people and have never like tried to go out and say, well,
[1:20:00.840 --> 1:20:03.640]  an adult shouldn't be able to do what they want, but here's the problem.
[1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:06.280]  When you do that, it's been, okay, just let us have gay marriage.
[1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:08.440]  Well, now it's let us have access to your children.
[1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:11.760]  Let us teach them gender dysphoria so we can get their testicles.
[1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:12.760]  And it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:15.560]  So this wasn't just about you having freedom to have your own choices.
[1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:19.080]  You actually want to tell me what words I can use, what I can do.
[1:20:19.080 --> 1:20:23.000]  And so, you know, I've done comedic stuff, I've made gay jokes, I've done all that.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:28.280]  And I guess I can't even do that because it's all so toxic and it all normalizes this.
[1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:30.800]  And so I agree with you.
[1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:37.120]  We all need to get more hardcore, more conservative, more drawn the line here because any tolerance
[1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:42.280]  we bring is only like a white flag of surrender to a very evil anti-human agenda.
[1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:43.280]  Yeah.
[1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:45.680]  Tolerance and diversity is a lie.
[1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:47.520]  It is not our strength.
[1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:48.960]  It is our greatest weakness.
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:53.800]  And they prey on our weakness because we're too afraid to stand up against it.
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:57.680]  You know, they call us names and people immediately back down and apologize because they're so
[1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:01.400]  fearful of what these evil communists are saying about them.
[1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:05.280]  However, we should be like, you know what, if they are coming after me, I'm doing something
[1:21:05.280 --> 1:21:06.280]  right.
[1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:09.800]  Use it as encouragement because we are running out of time.
[1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:13.200]  They just only a matter of time before they start coming for parental rights.
[1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:15.840]  Actually, they're already coming for parental rights.
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:20.040]  Children don't even have the opportunity or the right to change their mind and go see
[1:21:20.040 --> 1:21:21.040]  a therapist.
[1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:24.640]  Should they struggle with gender dysphoria and like to get help with it?
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:26.640]  You know, it's illegalized in my state.
[1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:31.400]  You know, they have stripped parental rights where if parents don't want to start transitioning
[1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:35.400]  their children, well, you're big and we're taking them away from you.
[1:21:35.400 --> 1:21:37.600]  You know, next they're going to come from the home schoolers.
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:40.680]  They're going to legalize home school and then they're going to force your children
[1:21:40.680 --> 1:21:44.840]  to be indoctrinated in the public school system and that is where we are going.
[1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:48.360]  By the way, you're not exaggerating.
[1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:49.680]  It's already here in Texas.
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:56.880]  We have judges in Texas, in Dallas, taking little boys away and allowing them to be sterilized
[1:21:56.880 --> 1:22:00.680]  because mommy says it's what they want and then the kids in court say, I'll do what mommy
[1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:01.680]  says.
[1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:02.680]  I'll do what daddy says.
[1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:05.680]  I want to be a boy at dad's house, a girl at mom's house because mom gives them so much
[1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:10.160]  attention that they can't make a decision when they're a child about whether they want
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:14.320]  to join the military or by liquor, but we're going to let them make a decision about deadly
[1:22:14.320 --> 1:22:20.840]  drugs or surgeries run by again, sick, crazy dudes that look like they're out of a Rob
[1:22:20.840 --> 1:22:21.840]  Zombie movie.
[1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:22.840]  Yeah.
[1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:23.840]  Yeah.
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:26.880]  And we are expected to acquiesce to their request.
[1:22:26.880 --> 1:22:31.400]  You know, our taxpayer dollars are going towards funding these public school libraries where
[1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:34.440]  they are hosting drag queen story hours.
[1:22:34.440 --> 1:22:36.840]  They are mocking us as Christians.
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:39.720]  They are mocking and coming after us.
[1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:41.400]  They're coming after our children.
[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:45.520]  They are removing parental rights and it all starts with the breakdown of the family.
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:50.960]  If they can break down the family, the nuclear family, which is the foundation of this nation,
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:55.480]  they can break down our nation because that's everything that our party, that our country
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:22:57.600]  was founded on, was family.
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:00.040]  And that's why they went after family first.
[1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:06.640]  You know, we became a global leader in single parenthood just last year, which is awful
[1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:11.760]  because we also incentivized it, but also we pushed degeneracy and glorified ideas
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:13.840]  like the LGBTQ.
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:19.120]  We put on a platform, transgenderism, you know, our party is guilty of that.
[1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:20.960]  We glorified transgenderism.
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:21.960]  We put transgenderism.
[1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:23.600]  Let's talk about the Republican Party.
[1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:24.600]  Let's talk about the Republican Party.
[1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:29.240]  And I'm not even, I understand why they had a CPAC thinks he's doing good.
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:33.080]  I understand why Charlie Kurt thinks this is all good because I've been of that mindset
[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:34.080]  myself.
[1:23:34.080 --> 1:23:35.080]  But I'm seeing how it's been wrong.
[1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:37.800]  Let's come back and talk about this on the other side.
[1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:39.720]  I mean, I've always criticized the transgenderism.
[1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:40.720]  I always did.
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:41.920]  It was about biological attacks.
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:42.920]  I always did.
[1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:43.920]  It was about reducing fertility.
[1:23:43.920 --> 1:23:44.920]  I always did.
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:45.920]  It was about ending family.
[1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:53.280]  But when you're even nice and friendly to their operatives, it's endorsing all things.
[1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:56.360]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[1:23:56.360 --> 1:24:00.360]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:01.360]  pass.
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:04.480]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they
[1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:08.920]  reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold,
[1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:10.160]  being totally enslaved.
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:13.760]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:14.760]  that move.
[1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:18.760]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:24.440]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:29.360]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:35.000]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:39.600]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:45.600]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:48.560]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:52.440]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:56.480]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[1:24:56.480 --> 1:24:59.520]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:04.080]  They're trying to take over civilization and society, and they depend on the public being
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:05.080]  ignorant.
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:09.080]  That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:10.320]  Knowledge is power.
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:16.120]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:17.960]  vitamins and minerals.
[1:25:17.960 --> 1:25:21.200]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:24.160]  it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:28.720]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out

[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:09.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:14.520]  Hello, I'm Troyers with a great job writing shot done, Lauren Witzke, ran for Senate, got
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:16.020]  record votes in Delaware.
[1:27:16.020 --> 1:27:22.000]  She runs a pack standing up against the lesion fraud and the sexualization of our children.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.080]  And this is a bigger discussion that I'd already decided this morning to have about myself,
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:27.520]  so I'm not trying to inject myself in here.
[1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:31.200]  I should probably spend a few hours on this tomorrow or at some other time, maybe when
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:33.480]  I get back to Austin.
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:39.200]  Not repenting on air, but really talking about my thought processes because I was promiscuous
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:42.640]  when I was young, did a lot of wild stuff.
[1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:43.640]  I like to make jokes.
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:44.640]  I like to go crazy.
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:45.640]  I like to have fun.
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:49.680]  And I don't hate adults that are doing wild things.
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:53.240]  But then I realized it's all part of an agenda to go after our children and make them a commodity
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:56.800]  and it's all aimed at destroying their innocence.
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:01.440]  And so the whole thing is predatory and they're censoring us and they're controlling us and
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:05.840]  the left is waging war against us and it really makes me realize, I know God's real.
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:09.560]  I've experienced the Holy Ghost, I've got great discernment, God's gotten me out of
[1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:14.360]  a lot of things and I've been blessed to have a lot of great Christians in my family and
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:17.360]  I just realized that you really can't serve two masters.
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:22.560]  It's not like I'm wild or anything, it's just that we have to just basically draw a straight
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:28.360]  line and be ourselves even more conservative because it all just collapses.
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:33.160]  Sure, I mean, I make jokes, I do things I probably shouldn't do and it really does
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.640]  come down to we're in a very serious fight.
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:43.120]  You don't think the ancients or our Christian ancestors that do a very, very strong line
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:47.600]  against any form of corruption were doing it because they hadn't experienced things.
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:51.760]  They just come out of horrible collapse and decadence and everything that's being repeated
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:52.760]  now.
[1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:55.320]  I mean, at the end of the Roman Empire, they were raping the kids and all the rest of it
[1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:56.320]  as well.
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:00.440]  And every empire collapses, the Aztecs with them killing, not just raping the kids.
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:04.840]  And so we're entering that same cycle and we have to break with these people and stop
[1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:08.880]  doing what they want, stop listening to them because they want to bankrupt us.
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:12.120]  And at the end of the day, they want to sterilize our children and kill us, so I'm ranting here,
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:14.400]  Lauren, but you're absolutely right.
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:17.160]  In the seven, eight minutes we have left, oh, and jump in, oh, you've got a lot of points
[1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:18.320]  to make.
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:23.160]  It's just outrageous that Twitter would ban you for pointing out that one of these men
[1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:27.800]  that poses as a woman, it's a lot of predators, again, in the world poses women, but most
[1:29:27.800 --> 1:29:32.000]  recycle movies, it's a man posing as a woman, and we know that's in every culture that's
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:35.520]  happened for thousands of years, but some of the worst men poses women, and I remember
[1:29:35.520 --> 1:29:40.360]  Cuomo, not the one that killed everybody in the nursing homes or all that stuff, but the
[1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:45.520]  other one on CNN said, so if you're 11-year-old daughter, this is a tweet, doesn't like to
[1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:50.880]  see a man's genitals, he said penis, I mean, this is on CNN, folks, I don't want to even
[1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:55.080]  say it here, but what they're saying, then there's something wrong with her and her dad.
[1:29:55.080 --> 1:29:59.680]  She should have been taught to like to see a woman's, these are quotes, folks, imagine
[1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:04.520]  the gaslighting of that, oh, adult, because they were saying in public schools, adult
[1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:08.480]  men that are on the coaching staff, when they take the quote, girls to play volleyball,
[1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:14.800]  that 10, 11, 12-year-old girls would have the transgender woman who's a man with his
[1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:19.880]  genitals in the shower, and this is how crazy this is, this is how out of control this is,
[1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:23.280]  and they're saying all over the country, in executive order, we're going to put biological
[1:30:23.280 --> 1:30:27.240]  men in the showers with your little girls, it's happening, because if you'll put up with
[1:30:27.240 --> 1:30:29.920]  that, you'll put up with anything, so Lauren, I'm going to get you back for a full hour
[1:30:29.920 --> 1:30:32.840]  soon, I've got to leave in about seven minutes, but just speak to that, and then let's talk
[1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:35.840]  about election integrity, destroy or jump at any time.
[1:30:35.840 --> 1:30:41.360]  Yeah, absolutely, you know, this is a spiritual battle, it's always been a spiritual battle,
[1:30:41.360 --> 1:30:45.880]  and our enemy is very cunning, you know, this started years and years ago, and they played
[1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:49.680]  on our compassion, they played on our Christian compassion, they're really good at that, they
[1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:53.760]  did the same thing with immigration, oh, you don't want to invite half of the third world
[1:30:53.760 --> 1:30:58.240]  into your country, oh, then you're not really a Christian, and we bought it, you know, so
[1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:05.080]  we are running out of time, we need to become the party immediately, we need to become leaders
[1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:12.960]  of the talk therapy movement, we have to re-legalize conversion therapy, we have to start taking
[1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:18.400]  offensive positions on gay marriage and gay rights, because they, you know, none of this
[1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:22.880]  was part of the deal, they just wanted to get married, they broke their end of the bargain,
[1:31:22.880 --> 1:31:27.840]  and now they're trying to influence and infiltrate our party, and that is not our problem, you
[1:31:27.840 --> 1:31:32.720]  know, and we see the end result, we got a good glimpse at the end result when my tweet
[1:31:32.720 --> 1:31:38.360]  got banned, my Twitter got banned for calling out the end result as demonic for what it
[1:31:38.360 --> 1:31:43.560]  was, you know, so we have a good idea of what's coming, and what depends now, and the only
[1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:47.800]  thing that matters now is what we are going to do to stop it, we as Christians are going
[1:31:47.800 --> 1:31:52.800]  to stand up and do to protect our future children's innocence, my future children's innocence,
[1:31:52.800 --> 1:31:56.840]  you know, I do not want to raise my children in a world where I can't even send my daughter
[1:31:56.840 --> 1:32:01.840]  to the bathroom because she may get abused by a man dressed as a woman who is going to
[1:32:01.840 --> 1:32:03.800]  say that she asked for it, you know?
[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:08.000]  And by the way, while you're talking, while you're talking, show that fox who's headlining
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:13.720]  in guys, in Canada, in the US all over, every day I see an article where a man rapes a girl
[1:32:13.720 --> 1:32:20.080]  in a shower, little girls and adult women, it's all just as bad, show that monster, show
[1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:25.360]  his ugly face, and if that isn't demonic, and them telling us that that's a woman,
[1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:28.480]  nothing is, I mean, and look, look, look, he's so proud of himself, and they all look
[1:32:28.480 --> 1:32:33.400]  the same, they're damn pedophiles dressed up like women, sorry, go ahead.
[1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:40.680]  Yeah, no, that is what they are, and now they are trying to make the excuse, oh no, no,
[1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:45.560]  you're fine, now they're trying to make the excuse that it is their fault, they're the
[1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:49.240]  ones asking for it, the innocent children are the ones, they're not as straight and
[1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:53.800]  narrow as you think they are, so we're not the problem, it's them, they're asking for
[1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:58.800]  it, and you know, like you said, they look proud of themselves, they're not sorry, these
[1:32:58.800 --> 1:33:05.120]  people cannot be, they cannot be reformed, they simply cannot be reformed, so we have
[1:33:05.120 --> 1:33:09.200]  to start making examples of these people, we have to start calling it out what it is,
[1:33:09.200 --> 1:33:14.480]  and we have to start demanding that our elected officials or remove them if they do not cater
[1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:18.080]  to our demands, we are the majority in this party, we are the majority of the party.
[1:33:18.080 --> 1:33:20.280]  What up with the gay marriage thing?
[1:33:20.280 --> 1:33:21.280]  What up with the gay?
[1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:22.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:25.520]  They said, oh, this is all we want, and as soon as that happened, now they said we want
[1:33:25.520 --> 1:33:27.600]  your children and we want them now.
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:33.160]  Yeah, exactly, you know, our enemy is cunning, and he played on our emotions that they just
[1:33:33.160 --> 1:33:38.760]  want to get married, they just want to have the same rights we do, now, here we are, we're
[1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:45.080]  having chemical castrations for children, puberty blockers, for little girls, you know,
[1:33:45.080 --> 1:33:50.800]  this is where we are at as a society, and we can still reverse this, we can still come
[1:33:50.800 --> 1:33:55.560]  back from this, but we have to be bold, we have to be strong enough to say the things
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:34:00.280]  that need to be said, call out evil for what it is, and Alex, you're absolutely right,
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:05.560]  you know, as a Christian, I let a lot of things slide, I celebrated a lot of lifestyles that
[1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:14.200]  left my friends broken, or dead, most of them, you know, and compromising is not compassionate,
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:20.680]  not calling out sin for what it is, and forcing change, and not enabling sin is how we win
[1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:25.960]  this, enabling sin is not compassionate, the only path for that is death, and it's going
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:31.560]  to be the death of our children, 40% of them end up attempting suicide after they transition,
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:35.080]  and we are glorifying the transitioning process by giving it a platform.
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:39.680]  And I was reading statistics like half of them become sex workers, I mean, this is a
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:45.000]  predatory system that wants to destroy our men, turning them into this, and then also
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:48.960]  destroy our children and destroy our women, and it's a weapon, it's attacking women's
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:54.720]  spaces, women's sports, it's attacking little kids, it's turning men into the soldiers of
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:58.720]  destruction wearing wigs, I mean, I guess if Hitler were a wiggy, they would have said
[1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:02.280]  oh, he's Hitler, let him take over, imagine if Hitler said let me have your little boys
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:08.560]  and cut their genitals off, we laugh at him, but today it's so absurdist, it's so surreal,
[1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:12.960]  Owen Schroyer in closing, he'll be taken over next hour, I really appreciate you my friend,
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:14.840]  but any questions or comments for this great lady?
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:20.040]  Well, I think the main key that I'm watching here is the cultural war because, you know,
[1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:26.040]  I studied psychology in college, and so I have a bit of a knowledge, and it came naturally
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:29.120]  to me, but the people who have been studying psychology and documenting it for years certainly
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:33.040]  understand this, you know, when I was growing up, they understand propaganda, how it works
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:37.960]  on children, I remember, you know, magazines is a big place for children to get their
[1:35:37.960 --> 1:35:43.560]  propaganda, so I would see all the men's magazines or sports magazines, and I would see guys,
[1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:47.880]  you know, the got milk that are strong, I would see guys promoting, working out, working
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:51.960]  hard, I would read books written by like Derek Jeter about hard work and sacrifice, and so
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:56.400]  that's kind of like, that would be like the propaganda that I saw as a kid, like hey,
[1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:00.520]  I want to be big and strong, hey, I want to be successful, hey, that's the formula, well
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:04.600]  now they open up a magazine and they see a dude in a wig, they see a dude with, you know,
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:09.040]  eye paint, they see a dude dressing like Little Mermaid, and so all of a sudden that becomes
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:13.160]  the propaganda that they strive for, so of course the numbers of transsexuals is going
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:17.200]  to go up, or the numbers of gay people is going to go up when that's the propaganda
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:21.000]  that they're receiving and is coming into them and they're consuming.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.120]  We got to get Lauren Witzke back on the show soon.
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:28.160]  We love what you're doing, you're awesome, hopefully you'll come back on very, very soon.

[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:38.560]  and then I'm going to elect Republican candidates who will fight for us and these issues and
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:39.560]  fight for our families.

[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:55.400]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast, hell I've been
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:37:59.520]  on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that, but let me tell you,
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:03.840]  the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:07.680]  after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down, so please pray to keep
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:11.920]  info wars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well,
[1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:17.120]  and at the same time, go to infowarsstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:22.080]  film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay
[1:38:22.080 --> 1:38:24.280]  on air in the face of this thing.
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:29.160]  I need your help more than ever now, I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:34.440]  do it if you don't support us, so pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:39.320]  however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:44.160]  day at infowarsstore.com, whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:49.840]  films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:53.080]  and pro-god, thank you so much.
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:58.440]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air, about looking at
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:02.400]  the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public's so dumbed down that they
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:05.600]  don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:08.880]  we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:13.320]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists, they play God, and they think because we don't
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:16.360]  stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:20.280]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me, they've tried to get me
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:26.080]  to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit, I'm finished
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:30.720]  with God, and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:35.200]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:39.600]  the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power out of it.
[1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:45.440]  Whether you're just a steelworker, or a schoolteacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:50.000]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:53.480]  God of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:58.200]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:02.280]  Cell phones are an amazing tool, really they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:06.440]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:12.080]  Comps especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:16.560]  to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:22.520]  predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements, cutting them out of that
[1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:27.080]  data stream, absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:28.480]  In their own words, they admit it.
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:32.320]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket-pockets and things like that for more
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:33.480]  than a decade.
[1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:36.960]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:41.880]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great, and it just gives you that security to have
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:46.720]  power over your data, and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:49.080]  want Big Brother to know what you're up to, because it's another business.
[1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:55.400]  Get yours at infowarfstore.com today.
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:41:06.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:07.680]  Sergey Ivanov.
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:08.680]  Sergey Ivanov.
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:18.560]  Yes, wrote a very important article that was published in Russia that I'm going to read
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:19.560]  in full here.
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:24.560]  It was republished at theamericantaker.com, it's also up on infowarfstore.com.
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:29.840]  Sergey Ivanov, Vladimir Putin's former chief of staff, currently on the Russian Federation
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:35.840]  Security Council, has weighed in on the historical scale, quote, of the personality and achievements
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:39.560]  of President Donald Trump, an op-ed for Eurasia Daily.
[1:41:39.560 --> 1:41:45.440]  I have changed on a word of what he had to say in his National Ideology Putin, orange
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:49.640]  repeatedly of the dangers from the transnationalists.
[1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:53.640]  The Russians are joined by the British, and they're Briggs and the French with their front
[1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:57.400]  national led by populist Marie Le Pen.
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:02.480]  Populism actively straddles the Atlantic, and Donald Trump is regarded as the hero.
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:09.400]  Of course, you've got also down in Brazil, Bolsonaro, who again, I'm not bragging, I've
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:12.680]  talked to his son, he's in their Congress, they invited me down there, haven't been able
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:13.680]  to go yet.
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:16.760]  They said, point blank, you massively influenced them in the last 15 years.
[1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:21.440]  They've been listening 15 years, and that shows the power of this broadcast and you supporting
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:22.440]  us.
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:26.200]  I can tell you much of Trump's resistance and operating system against the globalists
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:33.800]  came directly from info wars, and again, that's why the enemy wants us shut down.
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:40.800]  I can tell you that I have talked to leading Russian intellectuals on and off air, and
[1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:43.800]  they have said that our fighting against the globalists has also been instrumental over
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:44.800]  there.
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:49.240]  But only because it dovetailed with Alexander Solzhenitsyn, as you grow, you learn things.
[1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:53.320]  Putin went from being a KGB operative to being a student of Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
[1:42:53.320 --> 1:42:57.120]  who he said was basically his central teacher.
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:02.360]  He went visiting right before he died privately and also visiting several times before he died.
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:07.280]  So I'm not lionizing Vladimir Putin, but he's blocking the transgenderism, the pedophile
[1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:10.560]  networks, the globalists and more countries do this.
[1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:11.880]  They can defeat the New World Order.
[1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:16.120]  So here, ladies and gentlemen, is why they hate Putin and hate Trump.
[1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:18.240]  There was no Russians helping Trump.
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:23.840]  In fact, Russia has the same globalists there operating, and Putin's barely in control.
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:25.360]  But stronger than Trump's, he had more time.
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:31.120]  And I'm not defending everything Putin does, but the key here is that the nationalist model
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:32.800]  that Putin has is the real threat.
[1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:38.000]  So when we say collusion, if what Putin has done spreads, it's over for the New World
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Order.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:45.040]  And leaders, it's why they want somebody like Biden to demoralize us and make us feel weak.
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:52.840]  So as Sergey continues, if Joe Biden, the American deep state and the world global elites
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:56.840]  have called Donald Trump the worst president in U.S. history, well, it is because they
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:01.080]  know best who is the worst for them, exactly.
[1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:05.160]  When you're fighting the globalists, you're fighting the establishment, not anti-fun BLM.
[1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:06.640]  You are the establishment.
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:11.680]  In contrast, those on the Russian side of the world itself correctly see Donald Trump
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:16.640]  as perhaps the best president in the history of the United States, a modern George Washington.
[1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:21.720]  As he explains, if the first president of America fought to lay the foundations of the
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:26.040]  nation state, the beginning of the American freedom that Trump fought and still fights
[1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:30.920]  to preserve, the legacy of the founding fathers should defend freedom, so that in the end,
[1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:35.960]  he will not come to be the last truly elected president of the United States.
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:42.140]  He, like Washington, is of the flesh of the people, 100 percent American, a classic self-made
[1:44:42.140 --> 1:44:45.360]  man, a living embodiment of the American dream.
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:49.760]  Trump is a successful entrepreneur, a man of action, a man of his word.
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:55.920]  He built up America all his life and became its true national leader, continuing what
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:58.160]  he wrote.
[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:02.520]  Not only Americans, but also world history of those past centuries hardly holds another
[1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:08.600]  example of a politician having no actual party machine at his disposal, who was likewise
[1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:13.280]  able to become the head of a state and receive such phenomenal support from the people.
[1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:18.320]  It is significant that even amid the intimidation of the pandemic used by the global disrupt
[1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:22.560]  Trump's promising triumph and election campaign and prevent the consolidation of American
[1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:28.400]  nation under its leader, many thousands of people gathered, at least to meet with the
[1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:29.400]  president.
[1:45:29.400 --> 1:45:35.920]  Other world leaders over the past half century can boast at least something similar, yet
[1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:41.880]  all a progressive, quote, humanity have taken up arms against Trump, the entire communist
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:42.880]  international.
[1:45:42.880 --> 1:45:44.880]  This is the Russians fighting communism.
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:50.760]  From the leftist extremists to Chinese comrades and ending with the Pope Francis fought an
[1:45:50.760 --> 1:45:55.240]  undeclared war to destroy American leader for all the four years of presidency.
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:01.320]  For all without control the U.S., the globalists cannot successfully build their new world order.
[1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:04.540]  This is Putin's former chief of staff and his main advisors.
[1:46:04.540 --> 1:46:06.160]  This is how the Russians are now.
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:09.480]  Just like you learn you're under globalist attack, you learn it's outside, you learn
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:12.560]  it's anti-family, you learn it wants to kill you, you reject it all.
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:15.920]  Doesn't matter if you were run by communists before, it doesn't matter.
[1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:20.080]  Now it's all about ideology and then success flows from the pro-human ideology and he says
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:21.080]  that here.
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:22.080]  This is victory.
[1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:23.080]  This is everything I say.
[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:24.760]  And they're not copying me, I'm not copying them.
[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:25.760]  It's prima facie.
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:28.280]  That's Latin for on its face.
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:30.080]  You know it on its face.
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:33.000]  You know normal and good on its face.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:35.480]  So why are the big companies banging the word normal now?
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:39.600]  Because they don't want you to be able to differentiate.
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:41.160]  It's normal to stand up for your country.
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:42.640]  It's normal to stand up for your family.
[1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:44.240]  It's normal to have strong men.
[1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:46.400]  It's normal to have good women.
[1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:51.000]  It's normal to build our sons and daughters and be strong, not we.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:55.400]  Together with Joe Biden, he continues, they celebrate not only BLM and their curators
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:47:00.040]  like Soros and Pelosi, not only Merkel and Macron, but also anti-democratic regimes around
[1:47:00.040 --> 1:47:03.480]  the world from China, North Korea and Venezuela to Cuba.
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:07.000]  This is the Putin's chief advisor saying break with all these authoritarians.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.480]  They're just waiting for leadership, folks.
[1:47:09.480 --> 1:47:10.480]  They're waiting for us.
[1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:11.480]  They're trying.
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:15.160]  In the United States itself, immediately after Trump came to the White House, deep state
[1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:21.400]  functionaries from both parties provided unrepresented opposition and unprecedented opposition to
[1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:23.680]  all of the endeavors.
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:27.520]  Like the real American hero he is, Trump took up the fight and virtually single-handedly
[1:47:27.520 --> 1:47:31.240]  confronted the global monster devouring the American state.
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:36.160]  He won this confrontation, perhaps the last Western of American history, fighting the
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:37.960]  bad guys from the deep state.
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:42.400]  He tore off their mask, the mask of freedom, democracy, concern for the welfare of the
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:46.760]  people under which the self-proclaimed world elite have done their business.
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:51.680]  Having torn it away, Trump presented not only the U.S. but also the world with factual proof
[1:47:51.680 --> 1:47:52.680]  of the existence of the deep state.
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:54.320]  Yeah, this is the big victory here, folks.
[1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:55.320]  Don't think Trump lost.
[1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:56.320]  They had to steal it.
[1:47:56.320 --> 1:47:58.520]  This is the big victory.
[1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:04.560]  The symbiosis of socialist, liberals, Democrats of all stripes and anarcho greens and forced
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:06.840]  the globalists to reveal their real goals.
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:11.960]  Now everyone is aware that the construction of the paradise on earth is by no means included
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:12.960]  in their goals.
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:16.240]  Rather, one can see the architects of the new world order are pushing humanity in the
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:20.840]  direction of the opposite of paradise or, as I call it, the dystopics, the dystopia.
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:24.200]  See, it sounds like I wrote this, but it's all true.
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:30.040]  Continuing, something else cannot be amazed.
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:32.440]  Why destroy a prosperous country?
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:34.920]  Why did Trump do wrong?
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:39.360]  In the shortest possible time, he accomplished phenomenal economic success, millions of
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:40.360]  new jobs.
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:44.960]  The growth in incomes, the percentage of working wealthy people among Hispanics and black Americans
[1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:46.120]  have grown significantly.
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:48.400]  The number of abortions has dropped significantly.
[1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:50.840]  Illegal immigration has been limited.
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:56.000]  Trump achieved phenomenal, tangible success in the international arena without a single
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  war.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.520]  On the contrary, the consolidation of peace in the Middle East.
[1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:06.560]  All this against the background, the incessant evil hiss, the worst president ever, close
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:07.560]  quote.
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:11.680]  Constant hysterics from a dim riff-raff of all colors of the rainbow.
[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:17.880]  From the old Italian witch, bitch Pelosi, to the well-fed clown celebrities and athlete
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:18.880]  morons.
[1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:23.840]  See, how can Russia not but love Trump, even though he did all sorts of stuff militarily
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:26.240]  to them just to get the neocons office back?
[1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:29.040]  Because we have the same enemy, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:34.160]  Comparison of these facts naturally leads to the question, why did President Trump not
[1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:35.280]  please the deep state?
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:41.160]  It is because he is not a minority, but just a successful white man.
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:46.240]  Today, for the leader of a Democrat country, this is minus, but there is no particular
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:47.880]  crime in this either.
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:52.640]  Or is it a crime to ensure rapid economic growth, to strengthen state institutions, to
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:56.440]  protect constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens, traditional family, morality
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:57.440]  and religion?
[1:49:57.440 --> 1:50:01.360]  The deep state should be interested in the power and prosperity of the United States.
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:06.040]  Surely, its functionaries cannot cut the branch on which they sit with their own hands to
[1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:09.960]  liberally destroy the country in which the ruling class is constituted.
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:14.120]  But they do because it is spiritual, continuing.
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:17.680]  Since at least the middle of the 19th century, liberals, socials and other, quote, friends
[1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:22.120]  of the people have been preaching that the economy plays a leading role in the life
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:26.360]  of society, this truth has become a mantra for the entire, end quote, white public.
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:31.480]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to finish the other page, but it's just all powerful
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:32.480]  truth.
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:34.960]  And if you understand this, it's over.
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:35.960]  We're under attack.
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:36.960]  Globalism is anti-human.
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:37.960]  It's the enemy.
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:41.800]  I don't care if you're in China, Mexico, Russia, Canada, the U.S., or Timbukh, Frickin'
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:43.280]  Tu, or Egypt.
[1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:44.280]  This is an attack on humanity.
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:45.280]  We're going to go to break.
[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:46.280]  I'm going to come back and finish up with this.
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:49.080]  Hand the baton to Owen Shroyer, who's going to knock it out of the park and host his own
[1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:50.080]  show today.
[1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:54.280]  I appreciate him sitting back up and taking some technical problems and adding great commentary.
[1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:55.600]  But let me get this out here.
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:50:58.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion, the enemy that I want you to have at the highest quality vitamins
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:02.560]  and minerals, amino acids, everything you need, for adults, for children, back in stock
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:07.560]  of being sold out, 40, what's 50% off, and free shipping, and 40% off, ultimate crude
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:09.760]  oil, that's an amazing deal.
[1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:14.720]  The privacy pockets sold out came back in that blocked the globalist tracking you with
[1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:15.720]  your cell phones.
[1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:22.240]  Those are back in stock, big discounts, infowarstore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:24.000]  We are fighting for a pro-human future.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:27.880]  And if you want to defeat these globalists, you must spread the word, you must pray for
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:29.240]  us, and you must buy the products.
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:32.240]  I thank you all for considering that, and the side with the side you're on.
[1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:33.240]  I know most of you have.
[1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:35.440]  This is serious, and now it's dawning on folks.
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:36.880]  This is not my opinion.
[1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:38.400]  InfoWars is the side, guys.
[1:51:38.400 --> 1:51:41.240]  Stay with us.
[1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:45.000]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.600]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:48.600]  Why do you do that?
[1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:50.840]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:55.240]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists, and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:59.240]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:02.360]  the two other types, because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:03.520]  Boom, we did it.
[1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:04.520]  It's popular.
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:05.520]  It's X3.
[1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:06.520]  Is it better than X2?
[1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:07.520]  You decide.
[1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:08.520]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:13.960]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping,
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:15.360]  and that is down and out.
[1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:20.280]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.
[1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:25.080]  It's strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[1:52:25.080 --> 1:52:27.520]  at mforwardstore.com and free shipping.
[1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:30.360]  Secure you're down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:31.760]  M4 at the same time.
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:42.080]  Down and out, exclusively available at mforwardstore.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:48.680]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government, but world government
[1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:51.040]  is only the control grid.
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:57.040]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[1:52:57.040 --> 1:53:02.600]  and attain immortality, but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:05.720]  of all carbon-based line forms.
[1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:07.840]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:11.560]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:13.440]  They are playing God.
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:20.200]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:23.200]  to carry out this transformation.
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:27.560]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on
[1:53:27.560 --> 1:53:28.640]  record.
[1:53:28.640 --> 1:53:31.080]  You have been warned.
[1:53:31.080 --> 1:53:35.560]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[1:53:35.560 --> 1:53:39.200]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:44.720]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:50.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:54:04.320]  Well, you've got your diamonds and...
[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:08.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:17.400]  This segment I'll finish is great op-ed written by former chief of staff for Vladimir Putin
[1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:20.200]  about the ideological spiritual battle we're all in.
[1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:23.560]  Then I'll finish up next segment and Owen will take over for the rest of the transmission
[1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:27.240]  in this hour that Paul Watson is going to be doing, the fourth hour ahead of Owen coming
[1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:30.360]  back during the war room today, three to six p.m. central.
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:34.040]  But Owen, this is the ideological spiritual line and this is everything.
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:38.480]  I don't try to sit here as a talk shows to go, we're the exclusive.
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:40.080]  You better listen to us.
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:41.320]  We know everything.
[1:54:41.320 --> 1:54:42.320]  And then, oh, everybody else are idiots.
[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:46.080]  So I'm trying to get people to adopt our worldview because it is the real view.
[1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:47.360]  It's from a globalist perspective.
[1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:48.840]  We just don't agree with the globalist.
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:50.240]  The globalists are taking over.
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:52.560]  They are in charge almost completely.
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:55.920]  They're trying to mop up resistance to really hammer the hell out of us.
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:55:00.680]  And thank God, Russia and a few other places have halfway fought this thing off.
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:04.400]  It doesn't mean they're perfect, but they're recognizing good versus evil.
[1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:05.400]  What do you think?
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:11.560]  Well, when I was leaving the scene yesterday of that socialist pro-mask rally, there was
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:18.560]  a local news reporter there who doesn't like it when I show up and blow up their scene.
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:21.640]  And I could see the kind of sneering gestures that were made.
[1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:26.320]  And I said, you're upset because Info Wars has a monopoly on the truth, but that's just
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:29.000]  because you refuse to say the truth.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.160]  We don't actually have a monopoly on the truth, but we're just the only people that
[1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:35.000]  are willing to actually go there and say the truth.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:39.720]  One of the odd things, which isn't really that odd, it's perfectly explainable that
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:45.600]  I think part of the topic with Laura Witzke is, DC conservatives really don't fight for
[1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:46.600]  anything.
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:48.400]  DC conservatives are rich.
[1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:49.440]  They're in a comfort zone.
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:51.400]  They have everything given to them, handed to them.
[1:55:51.400 --> 1:55:52.800]  So they're never actually going to fight.
[1:55:52.800 --> 1:55:54.800]  That's why the real fighters are coming out of Florida.
[1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:57.520]  The real fighters are coming out of South Dakota.
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:02.440]  The real fighters are coming out of Texas, Missouri, because in DC, oh, you know, we're
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:03.440]  all having fun.
[1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:04.440]  We're all schmoozing.
[1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:09.880]  We're all eating and drinking elite meals 24 seven, like they're no longer Americans
[1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:17.160]  anymore, but a, but a, but a no insurer, a Patrick Howley, an Alex Jones or Laura Limmer.
[1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:18.160]  We're Americans.
[1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:19.160]  We know we're being conquered.
[1:56:19.160 --> 1:56:21.680]  We know we're being taken over by evil and we're not going to put up with it.
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:22.680]  Yeah.
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:23.680]  Yeah.
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:26.640]  We weren't trying to get a position at the Republican feeding trough to be bought off.
[1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:28.680]  I mean, people try to get big to get bought off.
[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:29.680]  Don't know.
[1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:30.680]  We're not getting bought off.
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:31.680]  That's why we're under attack.
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:32.680]  Great point.
[1:56:32.680 --> 1:56:35.640]  And I think that Trump, and you know, by the way, Trump is unpopular.
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:39.800]  That's why the Republicans are using his name to fundraise an interesting kind of dichotomy
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:43.960]  here where the Republicans fundraising off of Trump, Trump sends them a cease and desist.
[1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:45.120]  Stop fundraising off my name.
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:47.520]  They say, go get bent.
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:49.240]  We're going to continue to fundraise off your name.
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:52.360]  So now Trump says, do not donate to the Republican party.
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:54.520]  Only donate to the save America pack.
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:59.440]  So, so Donald Trump gets it, and maybe he had to learn for himself being in the White
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:06.040]  House and DC for four years that yeah, conservative, he thought he could co-op them from the
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:07.040]  chicoms.
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:10.240]  He just like the Russian said, why not have a big powerful country because they want to
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:11.240]  bring the country down.
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:12.240]  Trump couldn't believe it.
[1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:13.240]  Now he says it.
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:15.480]  They actually want to destroy the country because they're firing enemies.
[1:57:15.480 --> 1:57:18.760]  They were picked because they hate this country because they're spiritually controlled by
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:21.960]  the same entities that want to cut little boys genitals off.
[1:57:21.960 --> 1:57:27.080]  Or they just are so out of touch, Alex, because they're still having their 40 ounce rib-eyes
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:28.080]  every night.
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:32.040]  They're still having their cocktails on the golf course at the country club every day.
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:36.600]  They're still living in their three mansions across the nation, traveling on the taxpayer
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:37.600]  dime.
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:39.160]  It hasn't hit them yet.
[1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:43.600]  And they don't have the foresight, Alex, to see that this is going to hit them.
[1:57:43.600 --> 1:57:46.880]  And so that's why, again, you see people like Whiskey who's fighting.
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:49.320]  You see the other conservatives who are fighting like Howley.
[1:57:49.320 --> 1:57:52.080]  And by the way, the Republicans are using Howley's name to fundraise, too.
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:54.400]  That's their number two name to go to to fundraise.
[1:57:54.400 --> 1:57:56.000]  And they say, oh, Trump and Howley aren't popular.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:00.080]  No, they are the gold standard for what is popular.
[1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:01.080]  What is populism?
[1:58:01.080 --> 1:58:03.720]  What is the new Republican Party?
[1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:10.040]  And it'll be interesting to see when the Republicans continue to raise money off Donald Trump.
[1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:13.560]  And then 2024 comes around, are they going to ingratiate Trump?
[1:58:13.560 --> 1:58:14.560]  Are they going to promote Trump?
[1:58:14.560 --> 1:58:16.880]  Or is it going to be back like 2016?
[1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:20.240]  And they're going to try to keep him out of the race, and you're going to see all the
[1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:21.880]  media go against Trump, too.
[1:58:21.880 --> 1:58:25.560]  Because I think for all intents and purposes, it looks like he does intend on running in
[1:58:25.560 --> 1:58:26.560]  2024.
[1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:27.560]  That's right.
[1:58:27.560 --> 1:58:28.560]  Oh, and stay there.
[1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:29.560]  And I know you're going to cover that after I go.
[1:58:29.560 --> 1:58:34.000]  I'm going to come back and finish up with this incredible report put out by Vladimir
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:37.320]  Putin's former chief of staff, one of his main advisors.
[1:58:37.320 --> 1:58:40.680]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com tomorrow's news.
[1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:50.040]  Today, spread those links, infowars.com, proofers you are kicking ass.
[1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:54.080]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[1:58:54.080 --> 1:58:57.080]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[1:58:57.080 --> 1:58:59.760]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[1:58:59.760 --> 1:59:02.760]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[1:59:02.760 --> 1:59:06.640]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:59:06.640 --> 1:59:07.920]  Knowledge is power.
[1:59:07.920 --> 1:59:13.680]  Our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential
[1:59:13.680 --> 1:59:15.520]  vitamins and minerals.
[1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:18.800]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals, because
[1:59:18.800 --> 1:59:21.640]  it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[1:59:21.640 --> 1:59:26.240]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out
[1:59:26.240 --> 1:59:31.080]  there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at infowars.com, and it's not just
[1:59:31.080 --> 1:59:32.920]  an incredible formula at a great price.
[1:59:32.920 --> 1:59:36.080]  It funds the info war at the same time.
[1:59:36.080 --> 1:59:38.360]  No other product you can buy does that.
[1:59:38.360 --> 1:59:42.640]  So again, infowarsstore.com, it's back in stock, pretty percent off.
[1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:43.640]  Vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:59:43.640 --> 1:59:45.840]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:56.880]  So take action today and give it to your first family as a gift.
[1:59:56.880 --> 2:00:02.320]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:04.640]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:00:04.640 --> 2:00:15.640]  Sergei Ivanov, former chief advisor to Putin.
[2:00:15.640 --> 2:00:22.240]  You can see the proof in the pudding, a pooty-poot, as George W. Bush called him, and that they
[2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:25.560]  are not letting him brainwash children that they need to have sex changes when they're
[2:00:25.560 --> 2:00:26.560]  seven years old.
[2:00:26.560 --> 2:00:29.560]  They're promoting Russians getting married and having children and Christianity.
[2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:35.800]  And there's this neocon propaganda that Putin's a secret commie still, and BS, Alexander
[2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:39.360]  Solzhenitsyn, fully endorsed him and said he was the real deal, and advised him on what
[2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:40.360]  to do.
[2:00:40.360 --> 2:00:43.080]  And the globalists hated Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
[2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:46.640]  I'm not saying Putin's perfect, but he's done what he's had to do to keep Russia out
[2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:48.120]  from the grasp of the New World Order.
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:52.560]  So there is a lesser two evils at Putin, and that's why they hate Putin so much, and they
[2:00:52.560 --> 2:00:58.720]  hate Trump so much because it's the same ideology of having a strong, healthy, normal country.
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:02.800]  So let's finish up here on the Alex Jones Show with this amazing letter.
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:06.000]  Since at least the middle of the 19th century, liberal socialists and other, quote, friends
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:10.800]  of the people have been preaching that the economy plays a leading role in the life
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:12.400]  of society.
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:16.720]  This truth has become a mantra for the entire enlightened public.
[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:21.800]  Yet, what did we see in Trump's case?
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:27.200]  It turns out that the global elites that preach, quote, economy are, in fact, much more concerned
[2:01:27.200 --> 2:01:34.560]  about ideology, particularly the protection of LGBT rights.
[2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:36.840]  What exactly does it mean to promote homosexuality?
[2:01:36.840 --> 2:01:42.440]  It is not just an abstract destruction of the traditional family, close quote.
[2:01:42.440 --> 2:01:45.440]  In fact, it is the propaganda of childlessness.
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:50.160]  That is, they push a human race towards a gradual extinction, towards self-destruction.
[2:01:50.160 --> 2:01:53.960]  How can the deep state fail to understand this?
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:59.560]  How do they inspire pay for BLM movement?
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:06.520]  The pogroms and disintegrations of churches, the moral terror against the forces of law
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:12.960]  and order, the strength of American statehood, perhaps other priorities of the global elites
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:18.280]  like feminism, the fight against racism, the green economy in combination with the prohibition
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:26.440]  of homosexuality, and the promotion of homosexuality will continue to the growth of the well-being
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:31.960]  of the American and other peoples, again, read that again, strengthening, kind of butchered
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:32.960]  that at the end here.
[2:02:32.960 --> 2:02:33.960]  My sight used to be perfect.
[2:02:33.960 --> 2:02:34.960]  It is not as good as it used to be.
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:35.960]  There is a sun shining on my eyes.
[2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:38.480]  So when we post this to them for us, guys, cut this little mess up.
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:39.480]  I don't know.
[2:02:39.480 --> 2:02:40.480]  We are live on there right now.
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:41.480]  Please put it up.
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:42.480]  Thanks.
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:46.480]  To strengthen American statehood, perhaps other priorities of the global elites like
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:51.000]  feminism, the fight against racism, the green economy in combination with the promotion
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:56.600]  of homosexuality will contribute to the growth of well-being of the American and other peoples?
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:02:58.520]  No, it won't.
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:05.000]  Another historically significant consequence of Trump's victory is the collision with the
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:06.240]  deep state.
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:10.600]  The American vanguard of the global elites in that secret has been revealed.
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:15.520]  The longstanding conspiracy theory regarding globalist intent on taking over the world
[2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:20.040]  has been clearly confirmed and ceased to be theory.
[2:03:20.040 --> 2:03:22.560]  That's the most important line out of this whole thing.
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:23.880]  Read it again.
[2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:29.000]  The longstanding, quote, conspiracy theory regarding globalist intent on taking over
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  the world has been clearly confirmed and ceased to be a theory.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:35.800]  It is now objective knowledge.
[2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:42.960]  It has successfully paused the experimental test and is no longer a hypothesis.
[2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:44.880]  As I said 100 times last month.
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:49.880]  It has successfully passed the experimental test and is no longer a hypothesis.
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:52.360]  It has gone from beta to operational.
[2:03:52.360 --> 2:03:56.160]  How many times have I said it's gone from beta to operational?
[2:03:56.160 --> 2:04:01.460]  It has successfully passed the experimental test and is no longer a hypothesis but an
[2:04:01.460 --> 2:04:03.800]  observable fact.
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:09.440]  Those who wish can call it a conspiracy or to be able to correct a non-public agreement
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:16.280]  of the elites included to achieve goals that are difficult to formulate publicly.
[2:04:16.280 --> 2:04:21.640]  Whether the globalist managed to build their new order and put an end to history, whether
[2:04:21.640 --> 2:04:26.440]  President Trump turns out to be its last hero, the future will show.
[2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:34.400]  But even today, thanks to our historic victory, everyone who has eyes to see who is leading
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:35.400]  and who is serving.
[2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:39.560]  Again, I'm going to read that again at the end, but even today, thanks to his historic
[2:04:39.560 --> 2:04:44.960]  victory, everyone who has eyes to see who is leading and who is serving, he ends his
[2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:51.040]  op-ed by saying, see and fight for your future.
[2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:54.880]  See and fight for your future.
[2:04:54.880 --> 2:04:58.480]  First you must see it, first you must know it, first you must understand it and recognize
[2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:00.000]  what it is and what its goals are.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  And the minute you get that, then you understand you're in a fight for your very future and
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:05.440]  for your very life.
[2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:09.200]  And it's a matter of your black, white, old, young, quote, gay, straight, this whole thing's
[2:05:09.200 --> 2:05:10.200]  anti-human.
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:14.200]  This isn't about gay dudes drinking martinis and having fun at the beach and giggling and
[2:05:14.200 --> 2:05:16.480]  getting married and hopping around throwing sand everywhere.
[2:05:16.480 --> 2:05:18.040]  That's the gateway drug.
[2:05:18.040 --> 2:05:24.560]  It goes all the way to pure absolute annihilation and death of the human species, transhumanism,
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:29.320]  Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley, the admitted plan, all of it stated by them, all
[2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:33.000]  of them on record saying a post-human world.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:34.520]  And so I'll say it again.
[2:05:34.520 --> 2:05:39.640]  I don't hate people who are homosexuals or heterosexuals, but I'm going to stop using
[2:05:39.640 --> 2:05:45.640]  the word gay because it all started 50 years ago saying, be nice, don't call it homosexual.
[2:05:45.640 --> 2:05:46.640]  That sounds clinical.
[2:05:46.640 --> 2:05:48.880]  Well, heterosexual is a clinical term.
[2:05:48.880 --> 2:05:51.720]  You know, it's an ignorance of science.
[2:05:51.720 --> 2:05:52.720]  Don't say Caucasian.
[2:05:52.720 --> 2:05:53.720]  That's your racist word.
[2:05:53.720 --> 2:05:57.840]  You know, don't say the word that just simply means African in Latin.
[2:05:57.840 --> 2:05:59.240]  It just means black.
[2:05:59.240 --> 2:06:03.080]  They're even talking about changing the name of Negromo dello because people think it might
[2:06:03.080 --> 2:06:06.400]  be the n-word when all it means is dark.
[2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:10.080]  So again, there's a war on knowledge, a war on communication, where at first, oh, just
[2:06:10.080 --> 2:06:11.080]  don't say gay.
[2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:13.920]  Now, don't say father or mother or boy or girl.
[2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:17.680]  Everything's hurtful and these guys are the high priest that control our lives, but it's
[2:06:17.680 --> 2:06:20.640]  not the homosexuals that are the high priest.
[2:06:20.640 --> 2:06:23.920]  They're just people that give their money to the system, to the corporate system, to
[2:06:23.920 --> 2:06:28.440]  help wage war against everything that's, quote, normal, because see, they don't want to live
[2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:29.440]  and let live.
[2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:30.440]  They don't want to have diversity.
[2:06:30.440 --> 2:06:31.440]  They don't want to have tolerance.
[2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:33.440]  I'm a very tolerant person.
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:39.320]  No, they want cultural and genetic dominance over everyone on this planet.
[2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:41.120]  So it's a very, very important letter.
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:44.960]  It transfers a little strange from Russian to English, because it's a pure translation.
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:48.440]  That's why I hesitated on a few spots and that the glare.
[2:06:48.440 --> 2:06:51.440]  So we're going to edit that down so it's clean dice, please.
[2:06:51.440 --> 2:06:56.080]  I'm going to get that out and make it a featured video because we're all in this together,
[2:06:56.080 --> 2:06:57.080]  ladies and gentlemen.
[2:06:57.080 --> 2:07:02.280]  You're in Africa, you're in Eurasia or you're in Asia or you're in Latin America, the U.S.
[2:07:02.280 --> 2:07:03.280]  We are all in this together.
[2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:07.760]  Owen Schreuer is going to take over for the next 45 minutes and then he's going to be
[2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:09.400]  hosting some of his own show today.
[2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:13.840]  Remember only way the dog hunts, which you share the links for Band-Aid video, infowars.com
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:14.840]  and newswars.com.
[2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:17.840]  And I'll throw this out again because when I plug, we're able to find our operation.
[2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:19.840]  When I don't, we're close to being shut down.
[2:07:19.840 --> 2:07:21.520]  I'm not trying to be a victim here.
[2:07:21.520 --> 2:07:24.840]  I'm one hell of a fighter and I've been blessed to be in this fight this long, but if you don't
[2:07:24.840 --> 2:07:30.040]  buy the products, we can't fight effectively and the enemy will successfully shut us down.
[2:07:30.040 --> 2:07:34.360]  I got a lot of irons in the fire, a lot of stuff going on, people don't even know about.
[2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:38.000]  And let's just say this, you see infowars, well, we're doing a lot more than what you
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  see there.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  The enemy's got all my phones tapped.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  They know what we're doing.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  It's all legal.
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:43.560]  But believe me, we've only begun to fight.
[2:07:43.560 --> 2:07:46.080]  I need a lot of capital if you want to win this fight.
[2:07:46.080 --> 2:07:51.480]  You can't spend your money anywhere that's got more bang for the buck, guaranteed dollar
[2:07:51.480 --> 2:07:56.480]  for dollar, pound for pound, we're the toughest, meanest, hardcore junkyard dog there is, powered
[2:07:56.480 --> 2:07:57.480]  by God.

[2:07:59.560 --> 2:08:00.840]  We're powered by God.
[2:08:00.840 --> 2:08:01.840]  We're pathetic.
[2:08:01.840 --> 2:08:03.400]  This is just a flesh bag.
[2:08:03.400 --> 2:08:07.480]  I've got this little pathetic spirit that was made by God and I can see God and God shines
[2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:08.480]  through me.
[2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:09.480]  God shines through you.
[2:08:09.480 --> 2:08:11.480]  But I need a platform to attack.
[2:08:11.480 --> 2:08:13.360]  I just want to attack the enemy with truth.
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:16.360]  So please, you've got my commitment to go 100% percent.
[2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:19.240]  Sometimes I'm going to fall, sometimes I'm going to fail, sometimes I'm going to stumble,
[2:08:19.240 --> 2:08:20.240]  sometimes I'm going to blow up.
[2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:23.520]  Sometimes I'm going to make a fool out of myself because I'm real and I'm a sinner, but I love
[2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:27.440]  God and I love justice and I need capital to fight this war.

[2:11:52.040 --> 2:12:06.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, from the front lines of the information war, it's
[2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:10.720]  Owen Troyer, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:17.960]  Alright, I'll be taking over the next 40 minutes of this transmission and then it's
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:21.880]  Paul Joseph Watson, I'll be back on hosting the war room with Tom Pepper.
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:30.600]  I want to get into the latest developments in the Biden saga, and there's actually been
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:35.720]  multiple developments since I sat down and put the stack of news on my desk at 11am this
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:39.400]  morning and so we'll get into that coming up.
[2:12:39.400 --> 2:12:46.160]  But yesterday, Biden did a live stream, it lasted about nine minutes, we played a clip
[2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:52.440]  of it earlier and it pretty much went the same as every other live stream that Biden
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:58.080]  does, nobody tuned in, less than a thousand people tuned in at its peak, had more dislikes
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:06.880]  than likes and it concluded with an awkward moment where as usual Biden didn't know what
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:07.880]  to do when it was over.
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:11.120]  He literally doesn't know what to do, he looks around awkwardly, he kind of steps around
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:16.720]  into circles, where do I go, what do I do now, who am I, and then it's awkward with
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:21.280]  the women he was up there doing a ceremony for, they have no idea, he has no idea who
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:26.560]  they are, he doesn't remember their names, he doesn't remember the name of his cabinet
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:30.960]  member that's standing right beside him, he can't even remember the name of the Pentagon.
[2:13:30.960 --> 2:13:35.480]  And then as usual, and this is the real lesson, guys if you can actually flash that video
[2:13:35.480 --> 2:13:41.400]  that we played earlier where he forgets the name, in fact here, let's actually roll clip
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:44.360]  three here so I can give you the context.
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:52.800]  I just want to thank you both and I want to thank the former general, I keep calling
[2:13:52.800 --> 2:14:01.920]  him general, my guy who runs that outfit over there, I want to make sure we thank the secretary
[2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:07.560]  for all he's done to try to implement what we've just talked about, and for recommending
[2:14:07.560 --> 2:14:10.360]  these two women for promotion.
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:11.360]  Thank you all.
[2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:12.360]  Watch what happens in the end.
[2:14:12.360 --> 2:14:15.560]  God bless you all and may God protect our troops.
[2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:25.960]  Awkward, where do I go, what do I do, now watch the women that just, I guess got a promotion
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:29.760]  in the military, watch what happens here, they're hopping up and down, they're hopping
[2:14:29.760 --> 2:14:32.000]  up and down, even listening to President Biden.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:39.040]  This reminds me of, you know, I remember in grade school or with cousins or like in summer
[2:14:39.040 --> 2:14:46.720]  camps, the girls would always be into like ceremonies and they'd do ceremonies, they'd
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:50.480]  do weddings and like award ceremonies and all this stuff, it was fun, they'd put on
[2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:55.840]  dress up, you know, kids having fun, but it was just kids pretending to have ceremonies
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:14:59.920]  and kind of hopping up and down celebrating, yay, we just did a ceremony, yay, we just
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:04.600]  simulated a ceremony, that's what this is like.
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:10.280]  These are arrested development adults that actually have never actually matured intellectually
[2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:13.520]  and they're still simulating their entire life like it's some sort of a celebration
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:14.520]  of a simulation.
[2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:19.200]  See, pump their fist, jump up and down and they all smile, we just did it, we just simulated
[2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:22.880]  a ceremony, yay.
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:27.000]  I remember for whatever reason, it was just every summer camp, like girls at recess and
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:33.240]  school, they loved simulating stuff and it was always like award ceremonies or weddings
[2:15:33.240 --> 2:15:36.320]  and it was just like that, they'd finish the ceremony and they'd all kind of hop up and
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:42.920]  down and clap, it was cute, they were kids, this is real stuff, these are adults simulating
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:49.280]  ceremonies that are actually supposed to be real, but oh, let's just promote these women
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:55.840]  for the military as a ceremony, as a simulation of a ceremony and then let's just celebrate
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:16:02.440]  it, yay, we did it, we completed the ceremony, it's like, you know, little girls at a summer
[2:16:02.440 --> 2:16:08.280]  camp will like do a fake wedding of like two stuffed animals or something and they jump
[2:16:08.280 --> 2:16:15.480]  up and down, yay, it's cute, no, this is like, they're actually doing it though, oh, yay,
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:21.120]  here's the president, we simulated a presidential victory, yay, hop up and down and wave, it's
[2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:29.200]  all fake, it's all child's play, but they're just puppets.
[2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:34.960]  But what is actually happening on the policy front, now, Saki is getting peppered with
[2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:38.800]  questions today about the crisis at the southern border, they're denying it's a crisis, even
[2:16:38.800 --> 2:16:46.200]  though they're now at over 100% capacity, they're now at over 100% capacity in these
[2:16:46.200 --> 2:16:51.480]  facilities, they're called reception centers now, but even the New York Times in their
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:54.240]  story today covering this, and I don't have it on my desk because I was just reading it
[2:16:54.240 --> 2:17:00.840]  earlier, they admit that they have the kids in cages and they say it's jail-like, that's
[2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:07.840]  in the New York Times and the numbers are only going up, you add over 100%, so you had
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:14.280]  more than double the illegal border crossings in January 2020 to January 2021, now February
[2:17:14.280 --> 2:17:19.200]  and March, it's going up even more, you're looking at, it's going to be triple in April
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:24.040]  and May, it's going to be triple, they don't have the facilities, so they're just releasing
[2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:28.160]  them all into the country, no masks, test positive for COVID, now, Jen Saki doesn't
[2:17:28.160 --> 2:17:32.640]  have a clue what's going on, I don't even blame her, how are you supposed to reiterate
[2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:37.800]  or communicate the thoughts of a guy who can't think, so that's an impossible job, but there's
[2:17:37.800 --> 2:17:41.640]  like, there is a crisis at the southern border, they don't have the facilities and they're
[2:17:41.640 --> 2:17:48.480]  putting kids in cages that they said that Trump was doing, that he wasn't, oh and also
[2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:54.360]  they have now removed, the Bidens, they can't even properly take care of a dog, and so the
[2:17:54.360 --> 2:17:58.120]  Biden dogs have now been removed from the White House, so Biden can't even take care
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:06.080]  of a dog, and well, there's other news coming out here, so let me just get into the stack,
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:11.120]  yes, Joe Biden is not even the acting president, he's as much of a puppet as you've ever seen,
[2:18:11.120 --> 2:18:17.160]  Kamala Harris is taking a bigger role in forming U.S. foreign and national security policies,
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:23.520]  and she's fielding all of Biden's foreign diplomatic phone calls, so what is Biden really
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:29.280]  even doing during the day, 10 minutes of some sort of a speech, signed to whatever executive
[2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:33.880]  order lands on his desk, doesn't even read it, admits he doesn't read it, and Harris
[2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:38.360]  is fielding his phone calls, and Pelosi is in charge of the military, the National Guard,
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:44.360]  and wants the nuclear codes, so Pelosi and Harris are essentially tag teaming the presidency
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:49.920]  right now, and Biden never clue what's going on, and now you have a new book coming out,
[2:18:49.920 --> 2:18:55.480]  and I think this actually explains a lot, new book claims cranky Biden had a habit of
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:19:00.040]  yelling at young staffers during campaign, he's an old man, he can't think he's confused,
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:05.440]  he's an elitist, he's lashing out, it's exactly what you would think, kind of like you can
[2:19:05.440 --> 2:19:10.240]  see the energy of an Andrew Cuomo, you can feel the vibes he puts off, now you know it,
[2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:18.600]  yeah, he covered up the nursing home deaths, yeah, he's a serial harasser of women, but
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:23.640]  now the Bidens can't even take care of a dog, Biden dogs banned from wine house after aggressive
[2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:27.560]  behavior and biting incident, how much you want to bet, we'll see what really comes out
[2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:32.360]  about this, we probably never know, apparently they have aggressive behavior, in their defense,
[2:19:32.360 --> 2:19:36.840]  German Shepherds are known to be aggressive, and if you don't properly exercise and take
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:42.440]  care of them, these dogs demand high maintenance, then they can be a problem, I had a buddy
[2:19:42.440 --> 2:19:49.520]  who got attacked by a German Shepherd when we were kids, they had to be put down, so
[2:19:49.520 --> 2:19:54.840]  my guess is though, Biden, much like he lashes out at young staffers, was probably lashing
[2:19:54.840 --> 2:20:02.520]  out at these dogs, and one of them took a, when he was reaching in, and so they probably
[2:20:02.520 --> 2:20:07.920]  got, so they can't even take care of dogs, so Biden deports dogs from the wine house,
[2:20:07.920 --> 2:20:13.440]  he also has pledged to end the scourge of sexual assaults in the military, yeah, I'm sure
[2:20:13.440 --> 2:20:18.520]  by bringing in trannies and now saying that everybody should be wearing makeup and earrings
[2:20:18.520 --> 2:20:23.000]  and be sexualized in the military, I'm sure that will help, Biden plans cyber attacks
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:27.840]  against Russia for solar winds hacks, solar winds hack, but ignores Chinese involvement,
[2:20:27.840 --> 2:20:32.880]  so folks, they're building up to war right now with Iran, they're posturing themselves
[2:20:32.880 --> 2:20:38.680]  against Russia, obviously you know about what's happening in Syria, so this is all the Biden
[2:20:38.680 --> 2:20:44.000]  foreign policy, which is actually being executed right now by Kamala Harris, who nobody has
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  any respect for, she calls these people, most people pick up, they don't even know who she
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:53.080]  is, humanity has been domesticated by and large, the population has been trained to
[2:20:53.080 --> 2:20:57.600]  submit, do what you're told, it's all gonna pass, but if you study authoritarians, if
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:00.880]  you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training
[2:21:00.880 --> 2:21:05.280]  is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved, and because
[2:21:05.280 --> 2:21:09.480]  the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move, and
[2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:13.640]  they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons, to then flood us with the
[2:21:13.640 --> 2:21:19.280]  third world, that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under
[2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:24.200]  such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[2:21:24.200 --> 2:21:29.880]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[2:21:29.880 --> 2:21:34.480]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:40.480]  year long lockdowns, that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:46.320]  get more IMF and World Bank money, and that's why we have to really get educated about the
[2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:47.320]  globalists.
[2:21:47.320 --> 2:21:53.920]  I knew Trump was in battles, I knew he was surrounded by cowards, and by double talking
[2:21:53.920 --> 2:22:00.320]  agents of the enemy, and a lot of people just couldn't believe it, they're like, oh no,
[2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:04.800]  it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible, and I understand why people wanted to believe
[2:22:04.800 --> 2:22:08.360]  that, because this is scary what's going on, the global government in the new world order,
[2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:11.600]  now that people hold up the fact that that's real, they won't somebody to come save them
[2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:12.600]  from.
[2:22:12.600 --> 2:22:16.960]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried, my gosh, he'll get out, prescription drug prices just
[2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:20.960]  tripled, or quadrupled, depending on the drug, once you've signed that executive order,
[2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:25.520]  we pay the most of anybody in the world, that's just one case of hundreds of things that
[2:22:25.520 --> 2:22:29.680]  Trump had reversed, and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy
[2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:34.760]  cost, everything else, but what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate, where Trump's
[2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:38.960]  own lawyers are attacking him, and putting him down, and saying he lost the election,
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:43.800]  and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity, because the fix is in folks, the
[2:22:43.800 --> 2:22:47.160]  swamp is deep, Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[2:22:47.160 --> 2:22:52.960]  I actually bought this in blocks, UHF frequencies, Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones
[2:22:52.960 --> 2:22:59.640]  are constantly spying on us, not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording
[2:22:59.640 --> 2:23:04.560]  audio and video as well, with or without a battery.

[2:23:50.520 --> 2:24:10.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:21.840]  So folks imagine, the president is supposed to go Biden, he was never elected.
[2:24:21.840 --> 2:24:23.880]  Record number of votes, but at least popular of all time, it adds up, it makes sense, not.
[2:24:23.880 --> 2:24:28.520]  Imagine though, you don't even remember the name of your Secretary of Defense, who's currently
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:30.520]  threatening to strike Iran.
[2:24:30.520 --> 2:24:39.720]  I mean seriously, think about this, your Secretary of Defense is talking about striking Iran inevitably,
[2:24:39.720 --> 2:24:42.840]  and you don't even know his name.
[2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:45.800]  That's Joe Biden.
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:50.840]  So what role is Joe Biden really fulfilling as the president?
[2:24:50.840 --> 2:24:54.600]  The media asked Jen Psaki, hey when is the president going to have a press conference?
[2:24:54.600 --> 2:24:57.640]  Jen Psaki says he's too busy dealing with national crises.
[2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:02.600]  That's exactly when you have a press conference.
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:06.000]  That's the exact time when you address the nation.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:08.520]  So the nation is in chaos.
[2:25:08.520 --> 2:25:09.880]  There's crises happening.
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:10.880]  Okay can we get an address?
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:11.880]  Absolutely not.
[2:25:11.880 --> 2:25:13.520]  What do you think this is?
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:16.560]  So he doesn't address the nation.
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:21.240]  He doesn't even know the name of his Secretary of Defense, who's threatening to strike Iran.
[2:25:21.240 --> 2:25:24.840]  He doesn't even make his own diplomatic phone calls.
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:30.000]  Now imagine this.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  You're a foreign leader in a different country, and your phone goes off.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:45.320]  Yes hello, this is Lithuania, this is Ukraine, whatever, okay, yes hello.
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:48.800]  Yeah hi, this is Kamala Harris, how we doing?
[2:25:48.800 --> 2:25:52.400]  I'm sorry, who?
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:53.400]  Who?
[2:25:53.400 --> 2:25:56.240]  Kamala Harris, don't you know Vice President of the United States?
[2:25:56.240 --> 2:26:04.880]  I'm sorry, is this a prank, I've never heard of you, click, that's what's going on?
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:05.880]  And they're not even hiding it.
[2:26:05.880 --> 2:26:13.280]  Kamala Harris has been doing all the foreign affairs over the phone in place for Joe Biden.
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:15.800]  Most leaders don't even know who she is.
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:18.000]  She's a complete non-entity, non-factor.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:22.360]  So she probably calls up, she gets on the phone with these foreign leaders who expect
[2:26:22.360 --> 2:26:23.360]  Biden.
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:26.680]  And all of Kamala Harris, who are you, never heard of you, I'm sorry, I don't know who
[2:26:26.680 --> 2:26:27.680]  you are.
[2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:31.440]  We're trying to talk to the president here, not some dingbat, thank you.
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:34.000]  So that's how that's going.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:41.400]  A complete disaster, the southern border collapsing.
[2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:43.760]  There's more developing here.
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:51.000]  12 states have sued Biden for executive order assigning social cost to carbon emissions.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:55.360]  Oh, there's your social credit score, you said would never be coming here.
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:27:00.440]  Missouri, Arkansas, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
[2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:05.080]  Tennessee, and Utah have filed a collective lawsuit against the Biden administration for
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:09.280]  arbitrarily trying to assign a social cost to greenhouse gas emissions in an executive
[2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:10.280]  order.
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:11.480]  Now, he probably doesn't even know this.
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:14.960]  He probably doesn't even know what's going on.
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:18.240]  So he's just signing whatever is on his desk.
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:20.680]  But there's the beginning of your social credit score.
[2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:22.960]  How much carbon are you emitting?
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:27.280]  And they've got the smart meter on your house, they've got the smart meter on your car, they'll
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:31.520]  have smart meters on your toilet.
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:35.960]  So you can only take one poop a day, you can only drive a mile a day, and you can only
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:38.280]  heat or cool your home for an hour a day.
[2:27:38.280 --> 2:27:39.520]  This is the new freedom.
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:40.520]  This is new.
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:41.760]  This is freedom now.
[2:27:41.760 --> 2:27:47.440]  In America, in the Biden administration, oil continues to skyrocket if you try to get
[2:27:47.440 --> 2:27:49.080]  gas lately.
[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:58.240]  Yeah, your gas to fill your tank has probably almost doubled, doubled, President Trump wonders
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:00.440]  that would happen during Biden.
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:07.840]  And now they think oil could get to $100 a barrel by this summer.
[2:28:07.840 --> 2:28:10.280]  So get ready for that.
[2:28:10.280 --> 2:28:17.720]  All part of phasing out your ability to move about freely with cheap energy.
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:23.440]  And then they just signed the $2 trillion COVID stimulus, which from the first initial
[2:28:23.440 --> 2:28:33.000]  responses, the big news coming out right now on this, and more will obviously be developing.
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:38.080]  The COVID stimulus bill has really been hundreds of millions of dollars.
[2:28:38.080 --> 2:28:40.560]  It'll be over a billion, it'll be over a billion.
[2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:42.520]  We're talking $2 trillion.
[2:28:42.520 --> 2:28:43.800]  But wow, isn't it amazing?
[2:28:43.800 --> 2:28:51.160]  And you will see in the COVID stimulus bill that you just bailed out the states of New
[2:28:51.160 --> 2:28:57.440]  York, California, and probably Illinois and there too, but they've already done into it.
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:02.480]  New York and California were running at its highest deficit ever, were really bankrupt,
[2:29:02.480 --> 2:29:06.520]  and they've just been bailed out by the COVID stimulus bill.
[2:29:06.520 --> 2:29:13.200]  Doesn't help any American didn't actually do anything about COVID, just bail them out.
[2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:17.560]  Here's the story at infowars.com from Kit Daniels.
[2:29:17.560 --> 2:29:20.920]  Gems bailing out bankrupt blue cities and states with COVID stimulus.
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:23.600]  And so this is all developing.
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:26.480]  And this is what happens.
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:28.880]  Look at Venezuela.
[2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:32.200]  Venezuela issues million Bolivar.
[2:29:32.200 --> 2:29:35.080]  So that's just like imagine if you had a million dollar bill.
[2:29:35.080 --> 2:29:38.320]  So a million Bolivar bill.
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:40.880]  But how much is that worth US dollar?
[2:29:40.880 --> 2:29:43.640]  Do you like to take a guess?
[2:29:43.640 --> 2:29:52.560]  One million Bolivar is worth 50 cents, 50 cents.
[2:29:52.560 --> 2:29:57.600]  This is where they're trying to take our economy.
[2:29:57.600 --> 2:29:59.680]  Be not confused about that.
[2:29:59.680 --> 2:30:00.680]  It's all by design.
[2:30:00.680 --> 2:30:03.380]  That's why your energy prices are going up.
[2:30:03.380 --> 2:30:08.400]  That's why they're telling you they're bringing in the social credit carbon score.
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:11.040]  And then you're seeing what hyperinflation has done to Venezuela.
[2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:17.320]  That's what they're trying to do here.
[2:30:17.320 --> 2:30:22.680]  But it's not all good news for the Democrats in their plot to destroy America and our way
[2:30:22.680 --> 2:30:25.640]  of living.
[2:30:25.640 --> 2:30:31.160]  Macomb County prosecutor says criminal charges possible against Whitmer Gretchen Whitmer
[2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:34.880]  over nursing home scandals.
[2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:43.520]  Interestingly enough, same thing is happening to Cuomo, and he's got multiple things on
[2:30:43.520 --> 2:30:44.520]  his plate.
[2:30:44.520 --> 2:30:46.720]  He's refusing to leave, by the way.
[2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:49.040]  Almost admiring for that.
[2:30:49.040 --> 2:30:57.440]  Former prosecutor appointed to leave Cuomo harassment probe as publisher Holt's book
[2:30:57.440 --> 2:30:58.440]  promotion.
[2:30:58.440 --> 2:31:01.520]  So, right, Cuomo's got all these books and everything.
[2:31:01.520 --> 2:31:05.080]  He got his advance pays.
[2:31:05.080 --> 2:31:07.440]  Now it comes up he covered up the nursing home desk.
[2:31:07.440 --> 2:31:09.600]  Now it comes out he's a serial harasser.
[2:31:09.600 --> 2:31:10.600]  How many women is it now?
[2:31:10.600 --> 2:31:11.600]  Probably over five.
[2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:12.800]  There's going to be one more big name to drop.
[2:31:12.800 --> 2:31:14.640]  They think that maybe they can get him out.
[2:31:14.640 --> 2:31:15.640]  I don't know why.
[2:31:15.640 --> 2:31:16.800]  He doesn't seem to be going.
[2:31:16.800 --> 2:31:21.160]  Maybe it's all just a big charade to detract from the nursing home desk.
[2:31:21.160 --> 2:31:26.120]  And then finally, oh, Cuomo, after much dispute in a fight, he decided to step down.
[2:31:26.120 --> 2:31:29.840]  Just too many women came forward, and then he just gets away with all the death in the
[2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:33.280]  nursing home and then covering it up.
[2:31:33.280 --> 2:31:38.840]  So it looks like that is going to be the final story there.
[2:31:38.840 --> 2:31:42.600]  But you know, it's ironic.
[2:31:42.600 --> 2:31:47.840]  I'm going to play this actually coming up on the other side because the Democrats still
[2:31:47.840 --> 2:31:48.840]  don't seem to get it.
[2:31:48.840 --> 2:31:54.680]  They still don't seem to get how unpopular they are, but I don't think they care about
[2:31:54.680 --> 2:31:55.680]  that.
[2:31:55.680 --> 2:31:58.920]  They really are just on their mission to destroy the United States of America and then collapse
[2:31:58.920 --> 2:32:04.480]  us into the global government.
[2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:08.320]  But some states are fighting back.
[2:32:08.320 --> 2:32:14.240]  And I'll get to a clip coming up and how the Democrats are falling apart.
[2:32:14.240 --> 2:32:17.600]  I'll give you some other news and what's happening here in Texas.
[2:32:17.600 --> 2:32:22.360]  It's not just that Governor Abbott doesn't have the right to shut the state down.
[2:32:22.360 --> 2:32:27.520]  He didn't have that legal right while they're trying to give that legal right now with Texas
[2:32:27.520 --> 2:32:28.520]  HB3.
[2:32:28.520 --> 2:32:29.520]  I'll be covering that.
[2:32:29.520 --> 2:32:31.520]  But folks, remember infowarstore.com.
[2:32:31.520 --> 2:32:33.920]  Vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock.
[2:32:33.920 --> 2:32:34.920]  This is my favorite.
[2:32:34.920 --> 2:32:39.240]  Well, I shouldn't say my favorite, but one of my favorites, every morning I start the
[2:32:39.240 --> 2:32:41.200]  day with vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:32:41.200 --> 2:32:47.400]  That way I know I'm getting my vitamin B, C, D, E, and others, a thousand percent.
[2:32:47.400 --> 2:32:53.000]  And I know I'm getting those vitamins and nutrients just to start my day.
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:54.000]  And I mix it.
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  I like to mix it with juice.
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:58.560]  I drink it down with all my other InfoWare supplements, but vitamin mineral fusion very
[2:32:58.560 --> 2:32:59.560]  popular.
[2:32:59.560 --> 2:33:00.560]  It's been out of stock.
[2:33:00.560 --> 2:33:02.440]  We have it back in stock, 50% off.
[2:33:02.440 --> 2:33:03.440]  Yeah, here's the list.
[2:33:03.440 --> 2:33:06.760]  It's, by the way, we have the label there at infowarstore.com if you want to see for yourself.
[2:33:06.760 --> 2:33:10.840]  But here's a short list of some of the ingredients there.
[2:33:10.840 --> 2:33:16.960]  Vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin B12, calcium, magnesium, zinc, selenium, elglutamine,
[2:33:16.960 --> 2:33:24.400]  CoQ10, just a list there, a short list there of all the great ingredients in the vitamin
[2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:25.400]  mineral fusion.
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:30.640]  Start your day with it just like I do, 50% off vitamin mineral fusion right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:35.240]  All right, when we come back, though, we're going to show you what a former Democrat
[2:33:35.240 --> 2:33:40.200]  has to say about the Democrat Party and its racism.
[2:33:40.200 --> 2:33:44.160]  And I'm going to show you how the liberal media is confused why the Democrat Party is
[2:33:44.160 --> 2:33:46.480]  so unpopular.
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:50.200]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[2:33:50.200 --> 2:33:52.840]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[2:33:52.840 --> 2:33:54.480]  Why do you do that?
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:57.920]  Because different strokes for different folks, if we're talking to researchers and scientists
[2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:02.680]  and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep-earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:06.840]  out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:07.840]  pure iodine.
[2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:08.840]  Boom, we did it.
[2:34:08.840 --> 2:34:09.840]  It's popular.
[2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:10.840]  It's X3.
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:11.840]  Is it better than X2?
[2:34:11.840 --> 2:34:12.840]  You decide.
[2:34:12.840 --> 2:34:13.840]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:19.200]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:20.600]  And that is down and out.
[2:34:20.600 --> 2:34:25.560]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:30.320]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:32.760]  at infoorstore.com and free shipping.

[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:37.000]  And while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the import at the same time.
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:46.440]  Down and out, exclusively available at infoorstore.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[2:34:46.440 --> 2:34:49.840]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[2:34:49.840 --> 2:34:54.040]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:34:54.040 --> 2:34:57.280]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:35:00.360]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:01.680]  can to shut us down.
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:06.000]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  listening to as well.
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:13.080]  At the same time, go to infoorstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:18.000]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:19.480]  in the face of this thing.
[2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:21.600]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:35:21.600 --> 2:35:25.920]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:30.920]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy
[2:35:30.920 --> 2:35:36.520]  great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infoorstore.com.
[2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:41.200]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:42.200]  soul.
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:43.600]  All of it empowers humanity.
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:46.120]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:48.360]  Thank you so much.
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:52.400]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:55.400]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:36:00.000]  They're trying to take over civilization and society, and they depend on the public being
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  ignorant.
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:04.960]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:06.280]  Knowledge is power.
[2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:12.040]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential
[2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:13.880]  vitamins and minerals.
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:17.120]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:19.920]  it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:23.920]  Well, the vitamin and mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin and mineral fusion
[2:36:23.920 --> 2:36:28.320]  system out there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at infoorstore.com.
[2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:31.240]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:34.400]  It funds the info war at the same time.
[2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:36.720]  No other product you can buy does that.
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:41.000]  So again, infoorstore.com, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  Vitamin and mineral fusion.
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:44.200]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[2:36:44.200 --> 2:36:48.800]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:54.920]  My enemies are your enemies, they're the globalists, they're the extremists, they're a consortium
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:37:00.320]  of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires, wherever you want
[2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:07.200]  to call them, that are highly predatory, that are setting up a false famously land system
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:14.240]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic radiation to change the
[2:37:14.240 --> 2:37:20.520]  very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they can control like a
[2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:22.960]  pawn on a chessboard.
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:27.880]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the news is only
[2:37:27.880 --> 2:37:30.280]  going to tie it around our necks from here on out.
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:34.280]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news and want to
[2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:38.000]  only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the world order, but at the end of the
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:41.400]  day it's all about the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:45.960]  end of the human system as we know it, and on its ashes a nightmare being built, only
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:50.600]  admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[2:37:50.600 --> 2:37:54.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:54.600 --> 2:38:07.360]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I had a bit of a Biden moment myself there at the end
[2:38:07.360 --> 2:38:14.720]  because there's so many clips of Biden gaffes, it's every day now.
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:18.920]  I forgot that that clip was from yesterday and there was a new clip from today and I
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:23.200]  meant to go to the new one and I went to the yesterday one and then I forgot about the
[2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:24.200]  new one.
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:29.880]  So today, and we may not have the sound of this yet, I just sent it to the crew and there's
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:35.720]  a bunch of different angles and clips of this, Biden is in some sort of a department store
[2:38:35.720 --> 2:38:39.480]  or hardware store in D.C., okay, yeah, there's the clip.
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:40.480]  In fact, do we have audio?
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:44.440]  Yeah, go ahead and let's just go ahead and pop up the audio here and let me explain what's
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:45.440]  happening.
[2:38:45.440 --> 2:38:47.640]  Just go ahead and roll it, don't worry about the beginning of it, this guy's kind of babbling
[2:38:47.640 --> 2:38:50.120]  on, it's really the end that's important, but here's the video.
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:54.400]  Yeah, I also say we're the greenest hardware store in America, we have two urban farms
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:38:55.400]  actually.
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:38:56.400]  We've got two masks on here.
[2:38:56.400 --> 2:38:57.400]  We have Mary who's in the garage there and then we have Cultivate the City.
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:00.400]  You don't want to get to understand you mask face?
[2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:01.400]  Freak.
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:06.880]  You can't stop being able to see it from here, but if they want to give away...
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:09.880]  Yeah, we can't hear you, you mask freak!
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:21.160]  Now watch.
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:33.000]  So it's the same thing.
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:44.040]  Biden shows up at this event and has no idea what's going on.
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:47.920]  He doesn't know how to conclude it when the event is supposedly concluded.
[2:39:47.920 --> 2:39:52.480]  He doesn't even know it, so he kind of just walks in circles, looking around, walking
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:54.560]  in circles, confused and disoriented.
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:57.760]  The media realizes, okay, the event is over, let's try to get some questions in.
[2:39:57.760 --> 2:39:59.560]  Joe, what's going on at the border?
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:00.560]  What's happening?
[2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:05.040]  You can't hear the gaggle and he just confusedly spins around and then the White House press
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:06.400]  team says, what?
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:09.000]  No questions, no questions, we've got to go.
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:10.880]  No questions, no questions.
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:18.080]  I mean, this thing is falling apart at the seams, badly.
[2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:24.120]  Again, he doesn't even know where the hell he is.
[2:40:24.120 --> 2:40:27.560]  Double masked freak.
[2:40:27.560 --> 2:40:28.560]  Where am I?
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:29.560]  What am I?
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:34.240]  I told the crew this and I have my War Room crew have this clip that we haven't really
[2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:40.880]  done it, but I've told them I want the clip where Biden says, I wake up every day and
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:42.760]  I ask Joe, where the hell am I?
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:43.760]  He says that.
[2:40:43.760 --> 2:40:48.080]  It's like I should be coming in and out of every break with that clip.
[2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:52.400]  I wake up and I ask Jill, where the hell am I?
[2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:56.280]  Being honest for the first time, but let me move on because I got all this other news
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:40:59.360]  before I go host the War Room too.
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:01.080]  This is stunning.
[2:41:01.080 --> 2:41:04.720]  I don't know how they published in the New York Times this story.
[2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:10.280]  A vexing question for Democrats, what drives Latino men to Republicans?
[2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:16.480]  And for lack of time, I was going to read this, but I won't go too much into it, but
[2:41:16.480 --> 2:41:27.800]  it profiles an individual, Eric Ortiz, 41-year-old in Florida, Latino man, and the whole thing
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:32.480]  here has been bashing the liberal Democrats for being total frauds and how they destroy
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:34.240]  all prosperity.
[2:41:34.240 --> 2:41:35.960]  And they're basically mentally ill.
[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:39.560]  And the New York Times published this, but here's the irony.
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:41.320]  They don't even get it.
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:45.160]  What drives Latino men to Republicans is what they're asking.
[2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:49.280]  Democrat policy sucks.
[2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:53.800]  Socialism and communism is a death spiral.
[2:41:53.800 --> 2:41:56.240]  So what's, they don't get it.
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:41:58.880]  Why won't these people be brainwashed by us?
[2:41:58.880 --> 2:42:00.440]  That's what they're really asking.
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:03.840]  They know why Latinos, they know why people would vote for Trump, they know why people
[2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:05.360]  don't like the Democrats.
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:11.560]  Their liars, their cheats, their scoundrels, their crooks, their policies destroy all prosperity.
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:12.840]  But they already know that.
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:16.960]  The real question, if they were being honest, a vexing question for Democrats, why aren't
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:19.640]  Latinos falling for our propaganda?
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:22.840]  Why aren't black people falling for our propaganda?
[2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:29.080]  Vernon Jones gets it, former Democrat from Georgia, he put this very spicy take on the
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:33.160]  current Democrat Party during an interview up on his social media.
[2:42:33.160 --> 2:42:34.160]  Here it is.
[2:42:34.160 --> 2:42:38.280]  I didn't leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me.
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:43.160]  I've always been conservative all my life, but the Democratic Party that I got involved
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:46.360]  with 30 years ago is not the Democratic Party now.
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:51.680]  I mean, the Democratic Party is at a position now, they want to open the borders and they
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:56.920]  want to let people come in illegally and take those resources and resources from American
[2:42:56.920 --> 2:42:59.760]  families and give it to illegals.
[2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:02.760]  They come in now and they don't have to be COVID tested.
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:08.800]  And ironically, Joe Biden is putting them in the same prison cells, if you will, or those
[2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:12.920]  facilities that he and Obama did in their administration.
[2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:15.000]  But he wanted to criticize Trump for that.
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:16.160]  So and Trump got it right.
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:23.080]  He secured the border and he was able to stop the stop and release, they start stopping
[2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:24.520]  and returning you back.
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:29.240]  And so Democrats were supporting that foolishness with opening the borders.
[2:43:29.240 --> 2:43:30.240]  I'm not for that.
[2:43:30.240 --> 2:43:37.480]  I am so committed to the values that I grew up with until the Democratic Party does not
[2:43:37.480 --> 2:43:39.840]  relate to me on that agenda anymore.
[2:43:39.840 --> 2:43:45.600]  So there was nothing for me to do but to, I like to say, I brought a grand new party
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:52.320]  to the grand old party, brand new ideas, brand new opportunities, brand new people.
[2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:56.640]  And this part is getting off the ground and President Trump, he opened the door for African
[2:43:56.640 --> 2:43:59.600]  Americans like nobody else has in the past 60 years.
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:02.960]  He proved it by the minority votes that he got as a Republican.
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:08.680]  And the left, they are horrified by independent thinking black men like me because we don't
[2:44:08.680 --> 2:44:13.880]  believe that just because we're black that we should vote for Joe Biden because we don't
[2:44:13.880 --> 2:44:18.640]  believe just because we're black, we don't know how to get on the Internet and find out
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:19.640]  about COVID.
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:27.560]  Now, Joe Biden said those things, 2021, where's the left, where's, why there's not an outcry?
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:30.400]  Can you imagine President Trump and said something like that?
[2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:31.400]  It's just a double sin.
[2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:33.560]  So it was no question.
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:37.640]  That so-called big tent the Democratic Party has, it's only for folks for the left, not
[2:44:37.640 --> 2:44:42.600]  for independent thinking black African Americans, blacks or African Americans.
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:46.120]  But this identity politics, it's not helping us at all.
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:47.320]  I didn't leave the Democrats.
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:49.800]  So again, there's Vernon Jones, former Democrat.
[2:44:49.800 --> 2:44:53.840]  I guess he's officially Republican now, representative out of Georgia.
[2:44:53.840 --> 2:44:59.960]  But see, this is the real story and it ties together with the New York Times.
[2:44:59.960 --> 2:45:04.360]  A vexing question for Democrats, what drives Latino men to Republican?
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:08.440]  A vexing question for Democrats, why are black people leaving the Democrat Party?
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:12.240]  Well, Vernon Jones just said it all.
[2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:19.560]  But the real approach of the Democrat Party is totalitarianism.
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:25.960]  And so they don't want any dissent at all whatsoever.
[2:45:25.960 --> 2:45:30.680]  So they want you to follow up and eat hand and fist, anything their media puts out.
[2:45:30.680 --> 2:45:32.920]  New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC.
[2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:38.760]  If you don't just dive into the trough of that garbage, then they don't want you anymore.
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:43.960]  They want you fully brainwashed by their media, they want you fully indoctrinated by their
[2:45:43.960 --> 2:45:48.120]  propaganda and they want zero dissent at all.
[2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:50.200]  That's the Democrat Party platform.
[2:45:50.200 --> 2:45:52.280]  That's not popular.
[2:45:52.280 --> 2:45:53.880]  People don't like that.
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:56.160]  They like to be free thinkers.
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:46:01.960]  They like to have options, but not under the Democrat Party.
[2:46:01.960 --> 2:46:08.000]  Americans like going to the gas station and being able to fill up for 30 bucks.
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  Not in the Biden years.
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:19.160]  You're looking at 60, 70 bucks again, all by design, all by design.
[2:46:19.160 --> 2:46:21.080]  Biden can't even feel his own phone calls.
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:25.040]  They can't even take care of their dogs, which just shows that was a whole virtue signal
[2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:26.280]  just like everything else.
[2:46:26.280 --> 2:46:28.280]  Oh, look, we've got two dogs.
[2:46:28.280 --> 2:46:29.280]  We're cool.
[2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:33.040]  They deport them, kick them out.
[2:46:33.040 --> 2:46:39.240]  Really mistreated them, that's why they were acting badly.
[2:46:39.240 --> 2:46:43.000]  Pelosi's in charge of the National Guard, Pelosi in charge of the military, Pelosi wants
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:44.680]  the nuclear codes.
[2:46:44.680 --> 2:46:51.040]  It's all a big joke.
[2:46:51.040 --> 2:46:56.480]  So your gas prices will keep going up, the cost of heat and cool your home will keep going
[2:46:56.480 --> 2:46:59.800]  up, or they'll just shut it off altogether.
[2:46:59.800 --> 2:47:06.200]  And then the Washington Post and the New York Times will say, why is Biden unpopular?
[2:47:06.200 --> 2:47:10.440]  Oh, I don't know, the border is wide open, illegal immigration is worse than ever, people
[2:47:10.440 --> 2:47:11.640]  are losing their jobs.
[2:47:11.640 --> 2:47:14.560]  They still have the economy shut down for the most part.
[2:47:14.560 --> 2:47:17.480]  Gas prices are going up, energy prices are going up.
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:22.240]  The president can't even give a national address, won't do a State of the Union, won't do a
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:26.360]  press conference, forgets where he is half the time.
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:31.040]  So he can't even be on a video or a live video.
[2:47:31.040 --> 2:47:35.320]  And the liberals say, why aren't we popular?
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:43.640]  Why won't you, why won't you fall for our propaganda, why won't you be our slaves?
[2:47:43.640 --> 2:47:50.040]  We love women and gay people, come on man, come on.
[2:47:50.040 --> 2:47:54.720]  And they're stunned, and they even publish the story in the New York Times, I mean the
[2:47:54.720 --> 2:48:03.120]  guy lays it out perfectly, Eric Ortiz, and he says, the welfare state is bad for our
[2:48:03.120 --> 2:48:04.120]  people.
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:09.160]  The state became the father in the black and brown household, and that was bad, bad mistake.
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:11.000]  Why would I want to be stuck in that mentality?
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:15.440]  Again, this is all in the New York Times, and they're asking, why aren't Latinos voting
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:17.440]  Democrat like we told them to?
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:22.040]  Why aren't Latino men, why aren't black people, why aren't they totally under our brainwashing?
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:24.360]  Why don't we own them?
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:30.960]  This is the Slave Master New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, demanding the return
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:36.480]  of their slaves, they want their slaves back.
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:40.960]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars, and we brought you a new supplement,
[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:44.520]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[2:48:44.520 --> 2:48:48.920]  It is down and out, we don't mean bankrupt under a bridge, we mean down your bed sleeping
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:50.440]  hard throughout the night.
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:55.400]  It's got four milligrams of high-quality melatonin, it's got 25 milligrams of passion
[2:48:55.400 --> 2:49:00.600]  flour, it's got 50 milligrams of Valerian root extract concentrate, it's got 100 milligrams
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:04.720]  of lemon balm, and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:08.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula, I recommend you only take a quarter
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:13.040]  or a half the first time, it's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast, if you take
[2:49:13.040 --> 2:49:17.200]  it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off to sleep, it's incredible.
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:21.440]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest, it's so popular, we can't keep it in
[2:49:21.440 --> 2:49:22.440]  stock.

[2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:42.600]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[2:49:42.600 --> 2:49:43.600]  of the two.
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:46.640]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:51.640]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[2:49:51.640 --> 2:49:55.720]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[2:49:55.720 --> 2:50:00.960]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny leap above
[2:50:00.960 --> 2:50:01.960]  it.
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:07.240]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[2:50:07.240 --> 2:50:09.760]  of total mass high-tech slavery.
[2:50:09.760 --> 2:50:13.800]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:17.600]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave
[2:50:17.600 --> 2:50:18.600]  masters.
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:22.800]  A global permanent lockdown is here, it's already causing millions and millions to starve
[2:50:22.800 --> 2:50:23.800]  to death.
[2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:26.000]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:29.680]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:33.880]  and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:34.880]  That's the facts.
[2:50:34.880 --> 2:50:40.520]  This is the Bill Gates new world order weapon.
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:47.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:50:51.720]  Alright folks, we're about to have Paul Joseph Watson takeover.
[2:50:51.720 --> 2:50:57.120]  I want to remind everybody in case you didn't see, the full hour long video, which is just
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:00.640]  an hour of gold quite frankly, is at Band-Aid video.
[2:51:00.640 --> 2:51:06.600]  There was a pro-mass rally, I'm not kidding you, a pro-mass pro-vaccine rally in Austin
[2:51:06.600 --> 2:51:11.880]  Texas yesterday at the state capitol, I went to see how it was.
[2:51:11.880 --> 2:51:15.200]  The full hour long video is at Band-Aid video.
[2:51:15.200 --> 2:51:20.000]  Here's just a five minute snippet, but to find the full hour long, go to Band-Aid video.
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:22.080]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over on the other side.
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:25.560]  What is the percentage increase in death in the United States?
[2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:27.640]  I am not a scientist.
[2:51:27.640 --> 2:51:28.640]  So you haven't done your research.
[2:51:28.640 --> 2:51:30.720]  I'll tell you, it's zero percent sir.
[2:51:30.720 --> 2:51:35.000]  The death rate has gone up zero percent in the deadliest pandemic in US history.
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  How is that?
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  It's impossible.
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:38.500]  I think that is impossible.
[2:51:38.500 --> 2:51:43.680]  So this guy is the perfect example of a human that's really not even human anymore.
[2:51:43.680 --> 2:51:45.160]  His cell phone decides everything.
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:49.840]  His cell phone decides his politics, his cell phone decides God forbid he loses internet.
[2:51:49.840 --> 2:51:50.840]  What will you do then?
[2:51:50.840 --> 2:51:53.560]  I'd probably kill myself, bro.
[2:51:53.560 --> 2:51:56.080]  Well at least you'd be saving the world from global warming, right?
[2:51:56.080 --> 2:51:57.080]  But see, this is what people do.
[2:51:57.080 --> 2:51:59.040]  This is what the liberals do to the truth right here.
[2:51:59.040 --> 2:52:00.360]  They just drown it out.
[2:52:00.360 --> 2:52:01.360]  They just drown it out.
[2:52:01.360 --> 2:52:02.800]  They act like they can't hear it.
[2:52:02.800 --> 2:52:03.800]  They close their eyes.
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:04.800]  They close their ears.
[2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:06.120]  They don't want to know the truth.
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:09.240]  And this is why they're censoring everybody on the internet right now that speaks the
[2:52:09.240 --> 2:52:12.420]  truth because they just want the truth out of their lives.
[2:52:12.420 --> 2:52:13.840]  It's inconvenient for their lives.
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:16.160]  It's inconvenient for their totalitarianism.
[2:52:16.160 --> 2:52:18.280]  Are you pro-government or pro-freedom?
[2:52:18.280 --> 2:52:21.080]  That's a false equivalency.
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:25.000]  You can be both pro-government and pro-personal.
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:27.520]  The government restricts your freedom.
[2:52:27.520 --> 2:52:30.200]  Only to a point where it prevents you from...
[2:52:30.200 --> 2:52:32.000]  So you're pro-government.
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:37.520]  I am pro-government to a point that prevents people from harming each other.
[2:52:37.520 --> 2:52:38.760]  I'll give you credit.
[2:52:38.760 --> 2:52:39.760]  At least you're honest.
[2:52:39.760 --> 2:52:40.760]  You are pro-government.
[2:52:40.760 --> 2:52:41.760]  Yes, sir.
[2:52:41.760 --> 2:52:42.760]  So are you a communist?
[2:52:42.760 --> 2:52:44.560]  Do you want free stuff from the government?
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:46.320]  For certain things, yes.
[2:52:46.320 --> 2:52:48.160]  Like the prevention of disease.
[2:52:48.160 --> 2:52:49.400]  Excuse me, ma'am.
[2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:53.960]  Are you pro-government or pro-freedom?
[2:52:53.960 --> 2:52:54.960]  Pro-government or pro-freedom?
[2:52:54.960 --> 2:52:55.960]  I'm pro.
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:52:56.960]  My body, my choice.
[2:52:56.960 --> 2:53:00.800]  So are you interested in women's rights?
[2:53:00.800 --> 2:53:01.800]  So my body, my choice.
[2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:03.560]  So I don't want to take a vaccine or wear a mask.
[2:53:03.560 --> 2:53:04.560]  Is that okay?
[2:53:04.560 --> 2:53:07.480]  I mean, I think if you want to die, that's fine with you.
[2:53:07.480 --> 2:53:09.840]  I have never worn a mask and I don't take any vaccines.
[2:53:09.840 --> 2:53:10.840]  I'm still alive.
[2:53:10.840 --> 2:53:15.120]  But you can get the f*** away from me because you don't have a mask on and I do.
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:16.120]  But the mask protects you, right?
[2:53:16.120 --> 2:53:17.120]  Doesn't the mask protect you?
[2:53:17.120 --> 2:53:18.120]  It doesn't protect you.
[2:53:18.120 --> 2:53:19.120]  It doesn't protect you.
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:30.120]  It doesn't protect you.
[2:53:30.120 --> 2:53:37.120]  What EWOC is trying to do is train people how to become union organizers in their workplace.
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:38.120]  Communists.
[2:53:38.120 --> 2:53:40.120]  They should not be communists, right?
[2:53:40.120 --> 2:53:41.120]  Sure.
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:45.120]  Communism f***ing rules, dude.
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:52.120]  I'm going to end from a quote from, you know, Carl Marx, workers of the world unite.
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:56.120]  We have nothing to lose but our fame.
[2:53:56.120 --> 2:54:01.120]  As we beg to put the mask on our face.
[2:54:01.120 --> 2:54:03.120]  You're so small, by the way.
[2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:04.120]  No, I'm stuck.
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:07.120]  But you know what's great?
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:08.120]  Those are called muscles.
[2:54:08.120 --> 2:54:10.120]  If you worked out, you may know something.
[2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:11.120]  Tom, muscles.
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:12.120]  I need to.
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:14.120]  My brain's bigger than yours too.
[2:54:14.120 --> 2:54:17.120]  The mask is actually an IQ test.
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:18.120]  You failed.
[2:54:18.120 --> 2:54:22.120]  Did our sacrifice result in any action from our governor?
[2:54:22.120 --> 2:54:24.120]  Yeah, you destroyed your own prosperity.
[2:54:24.120 --> 2:54:26.120]  The government owes you nothing.
[2:54:26.120 --> 2:54:28.120]  You're already battling food and security.
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:30.120]  Get the f*** away from me.
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:31.120]  Yeah!
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:32.120]  Big tough one.
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:47.120]  Did that f*** just threaten a woman?
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:49.120]  Wow, you threatened a woman.
[2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:50.120]  What a coward.
[2:54:50.120 --> 2:54:55.120]  Now that you guys have finally subdued your communist energy, I want you to know that there
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:56.120]  was no pandemic.
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:00.120]  I know that's shocking that the television would lie to you, but go look at the death
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:01.120]  rate in the United States.
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:06.120]  The death rate in the United States of America did not go up a single percent.
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:07.120]  My body, my choice.
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:11.120]  If we don't want a vaccine and we don't want to wear a mask, that's our body.
[2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:12.120]  That's our choice.
[2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:15.120]  But all of a sudden, you're against my body, my choice.
[2:55:15.120 --> 2:55:20.120]  So it seems like all your other political policies, all your other political opinions
[2:55:20.120 --> 2:55:23.120]  are all hypocritical and all double-sided.
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:27.120]  If you look at the CDC's numbers for flu and pneumonia, they went down to zero.
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:32.120]  And if you look at the number of comorbidity deaths from COVID, it's 80 percent.
[2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:40.120]  80 percent of COVID deaths were cancer, leukemia, bone disease, obesity, heart failure, full
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:41.120]  age.
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:48.120]  This is Greg Rees from Infowars.com.
[2:55:48.120 --> 2:55:52.120]  I have many reasons to be grateful for working at Infowars.
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:57.600]  One of them is that we support ourselves with great products that promote physical health
[2:55:57.600 --> 2:55:59.600]  and vitality.
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:05.800]  I've been using health supplements for years, and I have found our products at InfowarsStore.com
[2:56:05.800 --> 2:56:11.000]  to be the best, especially our vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:16.080]  Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually
[2:56:16.080 --> 2:56:17.080]  did anything.
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:20.960]  I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:25.800]  But I felt vitamin mineral fusion the first time I took it, immediately.
[2:56:25.800 --> 2:56:27.840]  I love how it dissolves in water.
[2:56:27.840 --> 2:56:29.760]  I take it every day with my supper.
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:31.260]  It tastes great.
[2:56:31.260 --> 2:56:32.260]  Feels great.
[2:56:32.260 --> 2:56:35.160]  And right now, it's 50 percent off.
[2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:42.040]  It sells out fast, so stock up now at 50 percent off at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:56:42.040 --> 2:57:01.920]  Vitamin mineral fusion at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:57:01.920 --> 2:57:02.920]  Welcome back, everybody.
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:05.560]  We are live in Clown World once again.
[2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:10.920]  It was a famous individual, quite well known, called George Orwell, who once said the further
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:15.840]  a society drifts from truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:21.200]  And boy, do we see that compounding day after day after day.
[2:57:21.200 --> 2:57:25.760]  Later on in the show, I'm going to get into how the latest thing to be cancelled, apart
[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:32.800]  from Piers Morgan, who has finally left his show, because he called Meghan Markle a liar.
[2:57:32.800 --> 2:57:36.680]  Even though the vast majority of the British public agrees with that statement, he's finally
[2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:41.720]  been cancelled for daring to take on one of the archetypes of the woke mob.
[2:57:41.720 --> 2:57:44.040]  They finally got him for that.
[2:57:44.040 --> 2:57:48.360]  The other thing to be cancelled this week is the word normal.
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:53.040]  Yes, really, I'm going to get into that later on in the show.
[2:57:53.040 --> 2:57:58.880]  First though, I'm here in the United Kingdom where we are still under lockdown, despite
[2:57:58.880 --> 2:58:04.080]  the fact that the overall number of deaths in the UK year on year has barely ticked up
[2:58:04.080 --> 2:58:09.840]  by a percentage point, despite the fact that 90% of coronavirus deaths occurred with a
[2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:12.000]  comorbidity.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:17.880]  We're now being told that the coronavirus is set to come back, is set to surge later
[2:58:17.880 --> 2:58:19.080]  this year.
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:24.960]  Once again, the masks, the social distancing, the vaccines that we were all told to take,
[2:58:24.960 --> 2:58:29.680]  that we were all lectured, browbeat, and that we'd be killing granny if we didn't take,
[2:58:29.680 --> 2:58:32.720]  if we didn't comply.
[2:58:32.720 --> 2:58:34.240]  Well, apparently that doesn't matter.
[2:58:34.240 --> 2:58:38.680]  You see the headline there, which we had up yesterday, Bench Day, Big Day for Brits
[2:58:38.680 --> 2:58:41.520]  as government allows them to sit on park benches.
[2:58:41.520 --> 2:58:49.920]  Yes, as of yesterday, March the 8th, the wondrous, beneficent, gracious state actually said allowed
[2:58:49.920 --> 2:58:57.720]  us, gave us permission to meet another person from outside our own household for a coffee
[2:58:57.720 --> 2:59:01.360]  on a park bench, but not just a coffee, a picnic.
[2:59:01.360 --> 2:59:08.760]  Yes, they're allowing us to sit down in parks to have picnics with somebody who doesn't
[2:59:08.760 --> 2:59:10.800]  live in the same household as us.
[2:59:10.800 --> 2:59:14.320]  And basically that's about it for the next three months.
[2:59:14.320 --> 2:59:19.680]  Next month, in about five weeks' time, we may, we may, and that's the operative word,
[2:59:19.680 --> 2:59:26.760]  we may be allowed to get a haircut, we may be allowed to sit outside a pub and listen
[2:59:26.760 --> 2:59:27.760]  to this.
[2:59:27.760 --> 2:59:36.200]  Maybe, just maybe, in about eight or nine weeks' time, they might allow us to leave the country
[2:59:36.200 --> 2:59:38.080]  or even go on a domestic holiday.
[2:59:38.080 --> 2:59:44.400]  Yes, can you imagine how much we should be genuflecting in front of the state for graciously
[2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:46.320]  providing us with these freedoms?
[2:59:46.320 --> 2:59:48.680]  And of course, that is the point.
[2:59:48.680 --> 2:59:52.840]  Once they've set the precedent to take the freedoms away, they set the benchmark, no
[2:59:52.840 --> 2:59:57.720]  pun intended, that it's the government that gives you the freedoms, not that they're God
[2:59:57.720 --> 3:00:04.240]  given or innate, and that gives them the justification to bring back these rolling lockdowns again
[3:00:04.240 --> 3:00:06.200]  and again and again.
[3:00:06.200 --> 3:00:08.440]  And that's precisely what they've indicated.
[3:00:08.440 --> 3:00:15.080]  Today, headline out of Summit News, top professor, new surge of coronavirus to return later this
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:16.080]  year.
[3:00:16.080 --> 3:00:19.080]  They just can't get enough of this lockdown.
[3:00:19.080 --> 3:00:23.680]  You really think they're going to end it on June the 26th or whatever it is?
[3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:24.680]  Apparently not.
[3:00:24.680 --> 3:00:29.880]  Despite the UK planning to lift all restrictions in June, the country's chief medical officer,
[3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:33.920]  who basically has got every lockdown model wrong, they said half a million people would
[3:00:33.920 --> 3:00:37.760]  die immediately if there was no widespread lockdown never happened, but you can trust
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:38.760]  them.
[3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:42.840]  He says there'll be a new surge of coronavirus later this year, opening up the possibility
[3:00:42.840 --> 3:00:50.120]  of lockdown being extended once again, and guess who's to blame, it's those dirty, non-compliant
[3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:54.760]  rebels who didn't take the vaccine once again, we called that.
[3:00:54.760 --> 3:00:58.480]  Professor Chris Whitty warned MPs today that all the modeling, all the modeling that's
[3:00:58.480 --> 3:01:04.640]  been proven wrong, Professor Ferguson, time and time again, the guy who was so confident
[3:01:04.640 --> 3:01:12.040]  in his own lockdown that he personally violated his own lockdown to go and bang his mistress
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:17.080]  who was married, yes, he really believed in it to such an extent that the first available
[3:01:17.080 --> 3:01:24.200]  opportunity back in April, he was cavorting across London to meet up with a married mistress.
[3:01:24.200 --> 3:01:30.000]  That guy, that modeling, all the modeling in relation to COVID-19 shows that it will
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:35.080]  make a comeback at the end of the summer or in autumn, well imagine my shock, Whitty said
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:40.000]  the virus would target people who have failed to take the vaccine, all those on whom it
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  has been ineffective.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:47.480]  So again, the dirty anti-vaxxers or even the people who aren't taking the vaccine not
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:51.120]  necessarily because they think it's unsafe, but because they don't want to support the
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:57.640]  precedent that the government gets to inject you on a whim by force, basically, with these
[3:01:57.640 --> 3:02:02.480]  vaccine passports, with them now even still considering to this day, people not being
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:08.920]  allowed to go to a pub, to a cinema, even to a shopping mall, domestically, if they
[3:02:08.920 --> 3:02:13.680]  haven't taken the vaccine, that's the main reason why it should be opposed, even beyond
[3:02:13.680 --> 3:02:17.000]  concerns about safety.
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:20.760]  That same government is now telling us, or at least the advisors who have created this
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:27.640]  disastrous policy that's led to thousands and thousands of untreated cancers that will
[3:02:27.640 --> 3:02:33.760]  lead to 1.5 million TB deaths across the third world, but apparently leftists don't care
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:36.720]  about people in the third world anymore.
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:40.400]  That same government is now telling us it's all going to return because, of course, they've
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:44.720]  got this great reset policy set in stone, where they want to now bring it back on a whim
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:50.200]  at the drop of a hat, for anything, not just a new virus, not just a variant of coronavirus,
[3:02:50.200 --> 3:02:54.440]  but now, of course, climate lockdowns, and I'm going to get into that later on in the
[3:02:54.440 --> 3:02:55.440]  show.
[3:02:55.440 --> 3:02:59.400]  Oh, cities are so quiet.
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:03.280]  But Witty said all the modeling suggests at some point we will get a surge in the virus.
[3:03:03.280 --> 3:03:05.040]  We hope it doesn't happen soon.
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:09.120]  It might happen later in the summer if we open up gradually, or if there is a seasonal
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:11.600]  effect, it might happen over the next autumn and winter.
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:16.960]  So once again, just as happened in 2020, they're going to give people freedom for a couple
[3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:22.200]  of months, maybe three months, and then they're going to say, oh, no, it's back, get back under
[3:03:22.200 --> 3:03:28.880]  de facto house arrest, ban protest, de-platform people who question the lockdown policy on
[3:03:28.880 --> 3:03:36.200]  social media, which is now happening, of course, it was first COVID misinformation, then it
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:43.080]  was questioning vaccines, now it's basically questioning lockdown policy will get you de-platformed.
[3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:46.320]  You went on to say, but all the modeling suggests there is going to be a further surge, and
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:51.400]  when it happens, it will find the people who have not been vaccinated, yes, they'll be
[3:03:51.400 --> 3:03:55.880]  infected, and then they'll spread it, and then they'll blame those people, which will
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:04:03.360]  officially grease the skids for official discrimination against people who either refuse to get vaccinated,
[3:04:03.360 --> 3:04:08.680]  or who can't get vaccinated for medical reasons, as I write in the article.
[3:04:08.680 --> 3:04:12.680]  This enshrines the notion that freedoms aren't God-given or innate, but graciously provided
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:16.640]  by the government on the condition of total subservience, and that they can be instantly
[3:04:16.640 --> 3:04:22.840]  removed once again, if that level of fealty isn't sufficient.
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:26.400]  Now it's incredible when we look at the polls, and there was a headline that we had last
[3:04:26.400 --> 3:04:32.760]  week, majority of Brits say they will miss some or many aspects of lockdown, yes, the
[3:04:32.760 --> 3:04:39.160]  canary in the coal mine apparently really loves being in the coal mine, Stockholm syndrome
[3:04:39.160 --> 3:04:44.840]  writ large, a new opinion poll, and whether you believe these people are being honest
[3:04:44.840 --> 3:04:49.320]  when they're asked by these pollsters, it's very much up for debate.
[3:04:49.320 --> 3:04:55.240]  A anecdotal evidence suggests, from everyone I've spoken to, that people don't agree with
[3:04:55.240 --> 3:05:00.200]  this lockdown, they think it's complete BS, they think it's doing more harm than good.
[3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:04.520]  Every conversation I have, there seems to be a split down the middle of the people who
[3:05:04.520 --> 3:05:09.640]  you see out and about, who wear masks outside when it's not even a law in this country that
[3:05:09.640 --> 3:05:15.320]  you have to wear masks outside, with that paranoid shrieking look on their face, we're
[3:05:15.320 --> 3:05:19.760]  talking about the people who literally will jump out of the pavement into the road if
[3:05:19.760 --> 3:05:22.920]  they see you coming the other way without a mask.
[3:05:22.920 --> 3:05:26.600]  There are those people, and there's a lot of them, but there's also a huge portion of
[3:05:26.600 --> 3:05:30.880]  people who think it's all complete BS and that it needs to end now.
[3:05:30.880 --> 3:05:36.320]  Those people aren't reflected in the polls, so they're either not asking those people
[3:05:36.320 --> 3:05:42.520]  or those people are lying to the pollsters, which is a great number of them I would suspect.
[3:05:42.520 --> 3:05:48.680]  All these polls are just complete BS and completely dreamed up and manipulated, not to measure
[3:05:48.680 --> 3:05:52.600]  public opinion, but to manipulate public opinion.
[3:05:52.600 --> 3:05:57.200]  So there was a YouGov survey that asked participants, do you think you will miss?
[3:05:57.200 --> 3:06:01.400]  Do you think you will or will not miss any aspects of lockdown when it's over?
[3:06:01.400 --> 3:06:06.240]  9% of respondents said they would miss many aspects of lockdown.
[3:06:06.240 --> 3:06:10.800]  Yes, they love not being able to see their friends, they love seeing their businesses
[3:06:10.800 --> 3:06:16.360]  collapse apparently, they love wearing face nappies, they love the government telling
[3:06:16.360 --> 3:06:19.480]  them when and when they can't sit on a park bench.
[3:06:19.480 --> 3:06:22.560]  So many great aspects.
[3:06:22.560 --> 3:06:26.680]  Well 46% said they would miss some aspects of lockdown.
[3:06:26.680 --> 3:06:33.680]  So a majority of the British public, according to this poll, will miss some aspects of lockdown.
[3:06:33.680 --> 3:06:37.800]  How much does that have to do with the fact that they're getting 80% of their wage paid
[3:06:37.800 --> 3:06:41.520]  by the government to sit on their backsides and do nothing?
[3:06:41.520 --> 3:06:44.440]  Quite a lot I would suggest, don't go away, summit up news will be right.
[3:06:44.440 --> 3:06:48.560]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood burning fireplace
[3:06:48.560 --> 3:06:50.680]  and not spend thousands doing it?
[3:06:50.680 --> 3:06:53.600]  You can with Great Wall of Fire Fireplace Grates.

[3:07:14.600 --> 3:07:18.720]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[3:07:18.720 --> 3:07:19.720]  Me too.
[3:07:19.720 --> 3:07:23.880]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[3:07:23.880 --> 3:07:26.600]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:07:26.600 --> 3:07:30.960]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[3:07:30.960 --> 3:07:32.720]  You probably already believe that.
[3:07:32.720 --> 3:07:33.880]  I certainly do.
[3:07:33.880 --> 3:07:34.880]  So here's the thing.
[3:07:34.880 --> 3:07:39.240]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually
[3:07:39.240 --> 3:07:43.680]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:07:43.680 --> 3:07:49.120]  Now you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[3:08:14.400 --> 3:08:15.600]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:08:15.600 --> 3:08:19.520]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:21.080]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:08:21.080 --> 3:08:24.040]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:08:24.040 --> 3:08:27.360]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:29.560]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:08:29.560 --> 3:08:30.920]  I can help you too.
[3:08:30.920 --> 3:08:33.920]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:36.120]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[3:08:45.320 --> 3:08:49.680]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[3:08:49.680 --> 3:08:51.800]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[3:08:51.800 --> 3:08:56.440]  Really they're a super computer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations, hackers,
[3:08:56.440 --> 3:09:02.320]  governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS especially, are using this to steal your data,
[3:09:02.320 --> 3:09:06.760]  to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of
[3:09:06.760 --> 3:09:12.440]  people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:19.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:20.360]  In their own words they admit it.
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:24.360]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and blocket pockets and things like that for more
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:25.360]  than a decade.
[3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:28.840]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[3:09:28.840 --> 3:09:33.800]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great, and it just gives you that security to have
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:38.840]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big
[3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:41.040]  brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[3:09:41.040 --> 3:09:45.040]  Get yours at infoorstore.com today.
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:48.800]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:51.400]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodines?
[3:09:51.400 --> 3:09:52.400]  Why do you do that?
[3:09:52.400 --> 3:09:54.640]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[3:09:54.640 --> 3:09:59.040]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[3:09:59.040 --> 3:10:03.080]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:06.240]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[3:10:06.240 --> 3:10:08.600]  Boom, we did it, it's popular, it's X3.
[3:10:08.600 --> 3:10:09.880]  Is it better than X2?
[3:10:09.880 --> 3:10:12.040]  You decide, it's different strokes for different folks.
[3:10:12.040 --> 3:10:17.800]  Well now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid and
[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:19.200]  that is down and out.
[3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:24.120]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.

[3:10:47.840 --> 3:10:57.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:04.120]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:13.280]  Well back, I was out running in the park the other day and I saw a little booklet that
[3:11:13.280 --> 3:11:18.640]  had been dropped on the floor in the park and the name of this booklet, the front cover
[3:11:18.640 --> 3:11:22.760]  said, how to be a good person.
[3:11:22.760 --> 3:11:25.480]  I would suggest how to be a good person.
[3:11:25.480 --> 3:11:30.400]  Rule number one would be to not litter public parks.
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:35.240]  That would be step one in my book and this is the thing, these masks, these face masks,
[3:11:35.240 --> 3:11:39.560]  I see them everywhere on the street in the park, they're everywhere.
[3:11:39.560 --> 3:11:44.520]  These people who grandstand about how sanctimonious they are about caring about other people's
[3:11:44.520 --> 3:11:51.920]  health, about social distancing, seem very keen on littering everywhere with these face
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:55.960]  masks and this is the real question that hasn't been asked.
[3:11:55.960 --> 3:12:02.240]  When we have this mass debate, is the environmental impact that disposing or falsely disposing
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:04.600]  of these masks has had?
[3:12:04.600 --> 3:12:08.560]  We have a headline that speaks to that on Summit.News today.
[3:12:08.560 --> 3:12:11.720]  It means coral reef covered with face masks.
[3:12:11.720 --> 3:12:16.960]  Yes, they're all being dumped in the ocean, they're all being added to the plastic islands
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:22.560]  that pollute the oceans across the world, they're all broken down into micro plastics
[3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:29.160]  consumed by endangered marine life, nobody cares, nobody gives a damn.
[3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:34.160]  Same way, these leftists who pander about environmental issues don't give a damn about
[3:12:34.160 --> 3:12:36.880]  the third world when it comes to lockdown.
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:46.440]  1.5 million deaths from untreated TB experts have predicted over the next 10 years, 500,000
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:52.160]  children in the third world extra suffering from malnutrition as a result of the economic
[3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:54.760]  impact caused by lockdown.
[3:12:54.760 --> 3:12:59.680]  They don't care about that, they'll scream at you in the street for not wearing a mask,
[3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:02.200]  they don't care about this either.
[3:13:02.200 --> 3:13:07.520]  Researchers in the Philippines have discovered single-use face masks and other PPPE covering
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:11.840]  precious coral reefs and being consumed by marine life as the impact of lockdown takes
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:14.080]  its toll on the environment.
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:20.600]  We were told by the World Economic Forum that the cities are so much quieter, we were told
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:27.560]  by leftists that the CO2 emissions dropped so dramatically during the first lockdown
[3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:35.040]  that we need to have regular climate lockdowns again and again and again to save the planet.
[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:42.040]  Those same people, I haven't seen them talking about this, PPPE is washing up on coral reefs
[3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:47.960]  close to the Philippine capital Manila, according to an estimate by the Asian Development Bank
[3:13:47.960 --> 3:13:53.360]  during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, the city could have been generating up to 280
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:57.520]  tons of extra medical waste per day.
[3:13:57.520 --> 3:14:04.040]  So this video that you're seeing on screen now shows divers from Anilo Scuba Dive Centre
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:08.160]  in the Philippines and they go, they find all these masks, they explain how they studied
[3:14:08.160 --> 3:14:13.600]  the coral reef after the country's initial lockdown and found it was littered with masks
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:19.760]  and PPPE and one of the divers is quoted in this video as saying, just 10 minutes into
[3:14:19.760 --> 3:14:24.440]  the dive, we saw around 10 to 12 masks and we never had that before.
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:30.600]  Here on in this clip it shows you them fishing out literal bags full of face masks, protective
[3:14:30.600 --> 3:14:37.160]  gloves, gauzes, other medical equipment related to COVID-19, related to lockdowns, related
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:41.360]  to social distancing, face shields as well.
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:48.480]  I saw a woman running in the park yesterday, she was doing physical exercise, not just
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:53.400]  wearing a face mask, wearing a visor as well.
[3:14:53.400 --> 3:14:58.480]  Now even mainstream medical experts will say, that's a choking hazard, that's something
[3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:03.640]  that will get you into breathing difficulties if you're doing vigorous exercise while smothering
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:09.440]  your face, but the face mask wasn't enough, she needed the whole plastic visor as well.
[3:15:09.440 --> 3:15:15.480]  Clown world behaviour, this is how much people have been terrorised into complete compliance,
[3:15:15.480 --> 3:15:21.360]  an absurd submission that they'll literally risk their own lives and do vigorous physical
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:28.080]  exercise just so they can virtue signal at the same time, absolutely incredible.
[3:15:28.080 --> 3:15:34.240]  So they're finding all these face masks, covering the coral reef, why that's a problem is explained
[3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:39.780]  because polymers inside the surgical masks are breaking down into microplastics easily
[3:15:39.780 --> 3:15:45.100]  consumed by marine wildlife and the coral reefs that nurture them, but oh because the
[3:15:45.100 --> 3:15:50.680]  lockdown dropped CO2 emissions for a brief time, lockdown's good for the environment
[3:15:50.680 --> 3:15:56.160]  right, even as it's killing off the marine life and growing the polluted plastic trash
[3:15:56.160 --> 3:16:02.360]  that festoons our oceans, they don't care about that.
[3:16:02.360 --> 3:16:06.880]  Divers say what they've seen in terms of mass littering the ocean is the tip of the iceberg
[3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:11.960]  and then we had this other report from back in December by Oceans Asia which concluded
[3:16:11.960 --> 3:16:18.360]  that around 1.5 billion face masks will be dumped into the sea and further contaminate
[3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:24.640]  the oceans with harmful plastic and damage vulnerable marine ecosystems.
[3:16:24.640 --> 3:16:31.440]  So there's already 269,000 tons of plastic polluting the water, the vast majority of
[3:16:31.440 --> 3:16:36.200]  that by the way is thanks to India and China where the ones who are supposed to wash out
[3:16:36.200 --> 3:16:41.400]  all our little jam jars otherwise we're killing the planet, meanwhile the Chinese, the Indians
[3:16:41.400 --> 3:16:45.920]  literally just dump it into the ocean, no one cares, they're brown, don't blame the
[3:16:45.920 --> 3:16:53.560]  brown people, so there's 269,000 tons already in the oceans, masks will contribute an extra
[3:16:53.560 --> 3:17:01.240]  7,000 tons of plastic to the oceans according to this report by this environmental organisation
[3:17:01.240 --> 3:17:07.360]  which also said quote, marine plastic pollution kills 100,000 marine mammals and turtles,
[3:17:07.360 --> 3:17:12.000]  over a million seabirds and even greater numbers of fish, invertebrates and other marine
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:19.080]  life and then of course we eat a portion of that ourselves and then we become ill.
[3:17:19.080 --> 3:17:25.280]  Penguins in Brazil have been found dead with masks inside their stomachs, so marine life
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:30.400]  penguins are already suffering the consequences of this dumping of the face masks into the
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:34.880]  ocean, some of these environmental groups are putting out reports about it, the World
[3:17:34.880 --> 3:17:40.040]  Economic Forum doesn't seem so concerned, they're just too busy celebrating the fact
[3:17:40.040 --> 3:17:46.800]  that cities are slightly quieter and CO2 emissions have dropped slightly, there's an excellent
[3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:51.840]  article by the way which I'll read some of here, over at zero hedge the headline is the
[3:17:51.840 --> 3:17:57.520]  new normal phase two and it explains the current predicament we find ourselves in especially
[3:17:57.520 --> 3:18:01.840]  with the top experts now saying that these rolling lockdowns will be brought back again
[3:18:01.840 --> 3:18:08.080]  and again and again, quote from the article it says a globally hegemonic system has no
[3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:15.080]  external enemies, there is no territory outside the system, it's only enemies are within
[3:18:15.080 --> 3:18:20.920]  the system and thus by definition are insurgents, also known as terrorists and extremists, you've
[3:18:20.920 --> 3:18:26.800]  seen that narrative pick up since January 6th, these terms are utterly meaningless obviously
[3:18:26.800 --> 3:18:32.400]  they're purely strategic deployed against anyone who deviates from global caps official
[3:18:32.400 --> 3:18:39.200]  ideology, which in case you're wondering is called normality or in our case currently
[3:18:39.200 --> 3:18:45.720]  new normality, so again the quote I said at the start of the show, the further a society
[3:18:45.720 --> 3:18:52.480]  drifts from truth, the more it will hate those who speak it, it's not just people who deviate
[3:18:52.480 --> 3:18:59.760]  from the official COVID narrative, it's people who merely question reality and the punishment
[3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:05.520]  for those people who question reality as we're told that this global pandemic which has barely
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:12.040]  caused any uptick in the overall death rate of any major country is not as fearsome as
[3:19:12.040 --> 3:19:16.880]  we are being told, it's not just that we can question that reality and face consequences
[3:19:16.880 --> 3:19:22.240]  it's now got to the point where we can't even be allowed to exist in reality and that's
[3:19:22.240 --> 3:19:27.480]  when the deep platforming comes in, that's when now you get banned not just for being
[3:19:27.480 --> 3:19:34.160]  anti-vax but for questioning lockdown policies, now you're literally labeled an extremist,
[3:19:34.160 --> 3:19:40.200]  a terrorist for questioning lockdowns that provably according to many experts will kill
[3:19:40.200 --> 3:19:44.160]  way more people than the virus itself, don't go away.
[3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:49.320]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large, the population has been trained to submit
[3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:53.880]  do what you're told and it's all going to pass, but if you study authoritarians if you
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:57.320]  study the globalists you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just
[3:19:57.320 --> 3:20:01.880]  beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved and because the globalists
[3:20:01.880 --> 3:20:06.520]  see us as weak and see us as stupid they are now making that move and they are collapsing
[3:20:06.520 --> 3:20:10.680]  the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that
[3:20:10.680 --> 3:20:16.960]  the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis under such a load capitulate
[3:20:16.960 --> 3:20:21.600]  to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign hoping that they will stop the blood
[3:20:21.600 --> 3:20:27.560]  of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus
[3:20:27.560 --> 3:20:33.560]  Swab was saying and Bill Gates is saying but fleeing the year long lockdowns that the UN
[3:20:33.560 --> 3:20:38.880]  and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank
[3:20:38.880 --> 3:20:43.640]  money and that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[3:20:43.640 --> 3:20:49.800]  I sell supplements for two reasons because they work, they're real, they're powerful
[3:20:49.800 --> 3:20:56.120]  and because it's a giant market but again why is there a giant market because it works
[3:20:56.120 --> 3:21:01.760]  that's why it exponentially grows so whether it's Saupon Meadow and other key ingredients
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:09.320]  in our prostate formula, Prostagard or whether it is the super high grade organic vitamin
[3:21:09.320 --> 3:21:16.560]  B12 and ultra 12 or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force or the pure deep
[3:21:16.560 --> 3:21:22.760]  growth crystal iodine X2, these are all the very best supplements you're going to find
[3:21:22.760 --> 3:21:28.520]  in an already great market of high quality products after and it funds the InfoWare.
[3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:31.880]  So even if these products weren't high quality which they are, you're funding the InfoWare

[3:21:43.280 --> 3:21:47.600]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet.
[3:21:47.600 --> 3:21:50.760]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have
[3:21:50.760 --> 3:21:54.480]  a lot of credibility but I don't care about that, I care about beating the new world order
[3:21:54.480 --> 3:21:59.160]  and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer
[3:21:59.160 --> 3:22:02.480]  and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons
[3:22:02.480 --> 3:22:06.160]  I can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[3:22:06.160 --> 3:22:11.160]  the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please

[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:24.960]  No a lot of them don't, these are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the
[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:29.320]  whole world is waking up and looking for truth, that's why the globalists are censoring,
[3:22:29.320 --> 3:22:33.160]  they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air so while you're
[3:22:33.160 --> 3:22:36.880]  at it don't just financially support us and spread the word, download everything we've
[3:22:36.880 --> 3:22:40.720]  done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[3:22:40.720 --> 3:22:47.080]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:57.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:22:57.600 --> 3:23:04.800]  Live from London, England it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:23:04.800 --> 3:23:11.760]  Well of course we had the big Oprah interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the couple,
[3:23:11.760 --> 3:23:16.840]  the royal couple who says they are chagrin to attract media attention.
[3:23:16.840 --> 3:23:22.320]  The one thing they hate most is media attention, that's why she does Vanity Fair covers, that's
[3:23:22.320 --> 3:23:27.480]  why they do interviews with Oprah Winfrey that gets 17 million views because they really
[3:23:27.480 --> 3:23:31.200]  hate media coverage and just want to be private.
[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:35.560]  Of course that controversy continues with Piers Morgan stepping down from his show today,
[3:23:35.560 --> 3:23:40.840]  I'm going to get onto that in a minute because he called a liar a liar essentially, there's
[3:23:40.840 --> 3:23:46.320]  an article unspiked online called The Unbearable Victim Complex of Meghan Markle, bearing in
[3:23:46.320 --> 3:23:52.080]  mind during this interview she claimed that she never even googled Prince Harry before
[3:23:52.080 --> 3:23:58.440]  she married him and didn't know who he was and was supposed to believe that and was supposed
[3:23:58.440 --> 3:24:05.440]  to believe everything else, this cult of victimhood that they truly embody which has come to represent
[3:24:05.440 --> 3:24:09.840]  one side of the political argument in the culture war and that's what Brendan O'Neill
[3:24:09.840 --> 3:24:14.920]  speaks to in his article he says quote, there's something else going on too, something that
[3:24:14.920 --> 3:24:20.720]  goes far beyond Harry falling out with his dad or Meghan versus Kate, more fundamentally
[3:24:20.720 --> 3:24:25.920]  where witnessing a culture clash, a conflict between the contemporary cults of victimhood
[3:24:25.920 --> 3:24:32.040]  and identity politics is now keenly represented by Harry and Meghan and the older ideals
[3:24:32.040 --> 3:24:39.800]  of duty, self-sacrifice, stoicism and keeping your SHIT together as embodied by the Queen
[3:24:39.800 --> 3:24:45.200]  and as aspired to by most Brits in recent decades, excellent article which really lays
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:50.360]  out the reality behind the situation, you also had the claim during this interview and
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:55.880]  we're going to get onto Nigel Farage's comments on this in a moment that there was a conversation
[3:24:55.880 --> 3:25:02.040]  within the royal family and this was a horrendously racist thing to have even taken place about
[3:25:02.040 --> 3:25:09.760]  how dark the colour of the baby's skin would be given that Meghan Markle is what 25% black
[3:25:09.760 --> 3:25:16.600]  on her mother's side, those conversations were taking place on Twitter amongst verified
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:23.360]  liberals before the baby was born, that was the origin of those conversations with them
[3:25:23.360 --> 3:25:30.360]  celebrating, gloating virtue signaling about how dark the baby would be, it was their obsession
[3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:35.440]  that started it and now they claim that it originated from within the royal family, the
[3:25:35.440 --> 3:25:41.400]  conversation as to how dark the skin would be, that was a conversation originated by
[3:25:41.400 --> 3:25:46.480]  leftists saying oh won't all these conservative racists be horrified if the baby comes out
[3:25:46.480 --> 3:25:52.240]  half black, you started that and then she gets up with Oprah and blames the royal family
[3:25:52.240 --> 3:25:57.600]  for starting that conversation, another example of complete BS, here's Nigel Farage talking
[3:25:57.600 --> 3:26:02.160]  about this issue, let's roll it.
[3:26:02.160 --> 3:26:05.960]  So the big story of the day is of course Harry and Meghan, it's dominating everything and
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:12.840]  it will go on doing so for a very long time, it seems in America that they're gaining a
[3:26:12.840 --> 3:26:17.600]  lot of support, people feel sorry for them, they've got what's called movers advantage,
[3:26:17.600 --> 3:26:23.720]  they've got their side of the story out first, I'm not sure how the royal family are going
[3:26:23.720 --> 3:26:29.800]  to respond to this, they've been put in a very very difficult spot, but you know all
[3:26:29.800 --> 3:26:35.360]  of this was so predictable, I remember thinking at the time of the wedding and I was doing
[3:26:35.360 --> 3:26:40.160]  some work for Fox News on the wedding, I remember thinking why is Oprah Winfrey there, I mean
[3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:47.640]  Meghan met her once, I think she planned a big Hollywood career on the back of the princess
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:52.960]  right from the very word go and that Harry was just too weak to deal with it, but just
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:59.600]  look at the accusations that are being made, look at the charge against the royal family
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:06.360]  of racism, now everyone knows when a baby is on the way, there's always speculation
[3:27:06.360 --> 3:27:11.200]  what will it look like, who will he or she look like, what color will their hair be,
[3:27:11.200 --> 3:27:17.000]  how big will they be, what will they weigh, I don't know whether somebody in the Royal
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:22.000]  Household made a comment about what the color might be, I don't know the truth of that,
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:27.560]  I really honestly don't, but when Meghan was questioned on that, did somebody in the Royal
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:34.200]  Household ask what color the baby would be, she said potentially, either way we won't
[3:27:34.200 --> 3:27:40.920]  know, but it is the slur of racism against the royal family which really upsets me, the
[3:27:40.920 --> 3:27:47.680]  queen is coming up now for 70 years, not just the queen of our country but head of the Commonwealth,
[3:27:47.680 --> 3:27:53.880]  she and the royal family have ceaselessly over the decades toured around the Commonwealth,
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:58.960]  something that has meant so much to them, the vast majority of the 2.3 billion people
[3:27:58.960 --> 3:28:04.600]  that live in the Commonwealth are Asian or black, you could argue the royal family have
[3:28:04.600 --> 3:28:11.040]  done more for people of color than any other family or group of people in the world, so
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:18.120]  that charge to me just doesn't stand up, as for this whole business about mental health,
[3:28:18.120 --> 3:28:21.800]  about bullying, about being silenced, well you know she might have thought she was joining
[3:28:21.800 --> 3:28:27.000]  a soap opera, but she was joining the royal family, maybe she thought she was going to
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:32.840]  replace Lady Di, maybe she thought she was going to be the center of all attention, but
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:40.120]  the idea that she has somehow been done down or discriminated against in any way is nonsense,
[3:28:40.120 --> 3:28:44.760]  the crowds that were there on the day of the royal wedding, the street parties that took
[3:28:44.760 --> 3:28:51.480]  place across the country, the media, it was wall to wall, do you remember her going to
[3:28:51.480 --> 3:28:57.840]  Brixton, they were cheering, we love you Meghan, I can't think of anything, any negativity
[3:28:57.840 --> 3:29:03.920]  in the press at the time of their wedding, sure criticism followed, it always does if
[3:29:03.920 --> 3:29:09.200]  you're a public figure with English tabloid press, that goes with the territory, but this
[3:29:09.200 --> 3:29:17.400]  all started because Harry and Meghan were lecturing us about climate change, about carbon
[3:29:17.400 --> 3:29:24.240]  emissions, whilst flying around the world in private jets, and that was when the criticism
[3:29:24.240 --> 3:29:31.040]  began, so off they went to Canada, to live in isolated Canada, because they didn't want
[3:29:31.040 --> 3:29:37.640]  the press speculation really, well now Harry's on the James Corden show, they're both appearing
[3:29:37.640 --> 3:29:44.080]  and a two hour special with opera Winfrey, if you haven't watched the CBS output last
[3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:50.560]  night, you can if you wish, see it on ITV today, but it's all about victimhood, it's
[3:29:50.560 --> 3:29:56.160]  all about how badly they've been treated, and they are posing an enormous threat to
[3:29:56.160 --> 3:30:00.560]  the royal family, and we're going to find it as I said before, very tough to answer
[3:30:00.560 --> 3:30:08.440]  some of these negatives, I kind of grew up thinking that Edward VIII, what is Simpson,
[3:30:08.440 --> 3:30:14.000]  these were really bad people, and yet when you look at it, they were interviewed, big
[3:30:14.000 --> 3:30:20.880]  sit down in their house in Paris in about 1970, and both of them were loyal to the crown,
[3:30:20.880 --> 3:30:26.440]  did not say disablaging things about it to their dying day, despite the fact they were
[3:30:26.440 --> 3:30:32.480]  treated very, very harshly indeed, so we need to get the word out in America, I've been
[3:30:32.480 --> 3:30:38.800]  trying a bit today on some American media channels, that this is one side of a story
[3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:45.720]  and that actually they behave badly, and as for Harry, well whatever my criticisms are
[3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:52.800]  of Meghan, they are nothing as compared to how I feel about Prince Harry, to publicly
[3:30:52.800 --> 3:30:58.040]  betray members of your own family, in front of the world's media, the way that he's done
[3:30:58.040 --> 3:31:05.880]  is I think nothing short of being absolutely despicable, and when he says oh my father
[3:31:05.880 --> 3:31:10.360]  wasn't promising us lots of money, well of course not, because he wasn't prepared to
[3:31:10.360 --> 3:31:18.000]  go on doing the job, the most damning thing that I've heard about Prince Harry is there
[3:31:18.000 --> 3:31:23.360]  he was, Captain General of the Royal Marines, and on the day there was a Royal Marine event,
[3:31:23.360 --> 3:31:30.080]  a fundraising event, where was he, in Leicester Square, talking to the boss of Disney, Bob
[3:31:30.080 --> 3:31:38.400]  Iser, and overheard, overheard saying to Isner, my wife would like some voiceover work, so
[3:31:38.400 --> 3:31:46.800]  don't talk to us about duty being universal, we saw a better sense of duty I think, from
[3:31:46.800 --> 3:31:53.640]  the Queen talking about Commonwealth Day, which of course is today, I think the time
[3:31:53.640 --> 3:32:00.240]  has come to strip them of their royal titles, they are clearly intent on number one, destroying
[3:32:00.240 --> 3:32:07.240]  the monarchy, and number two, making themselves as bigger stars, as bigger leaders of the
[3:32:07.240 --> 3:32:13.760]  woke revolution in America and the rest of the world, it's a very very sad day for this
[3:32:13.760 --> 3:32:20.320]  country, I have no sympathy, no sympathy for either of them whatsoever, she must have known
[3:32:20.320 --> 3:32:24.760]  what she was getting into, he was born into a life of privilege, I know it was an awful
[3:32:24.760 --> 3:32:31.880]  thing to lose his mother in such a public way at that young age, but if we destroy the
[3:32:31.880 --> 3:32:38.200]  monarchy, we destroy something very special about this country, I think that's what they're
[3:32:38.200 --> 3:32:42.160]  intent on doing, and I'm going to do my best over the next week.
[3:32:42.160 --> 3:32:47.240]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[3:32:47.240 --> 3:32:53.040]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com, Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in

[3:32:57.040 --> 3:33:03.200]  Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects, according to ancient Samoan legend,
[3:33:03.200 --> 3:33:09.280]  Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[3:33:09.280 --> 3:33:14.360]  and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[3:33:14.360 --> 3:33:19.360]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by
[3:33:19.360 --> 3:33:24.960]  many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains
[3:33:24.960 --> 3:33:30.840]  a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German

[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:46.560]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. Hell, I've been
[3:33:46.560 --> 3:33:50.680]  on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you,
[3:33:50.680 --> 3:33:54.720]  the new world order is breathing down our neck. The big, globalist publications are
[3:33:54.720 --> 3:33:58.560]  coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to
[3:33:58.560 --> 3:34:03.040]  keep InfoWars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:09.080]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[3:34:09.080 --> 3:34:13.960]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:18.520]  in the face of this thing. I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting
[3:34:18.520 --> 3:34:24.440]  the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us. So pray for us, word of mouth,
[3:34:24.440 --> 3:34:28.200]  tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich

[3:34:44.360 --> 3:34:49.480]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset. They figured out that the globalists
[3:34:49.480 --> 3:34:54.120]  are literally trying to kill us. They're trying to take over civilization and society and
[3:34:54.120 --> 3:34:59.240]  they depend on the public being ignorant. That's why Jesus said, my people perish for
[3:34:59.240 --> 3:35:04.800]  lack of knowledge. Knowledge is power. Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues
[3:35:04.800 --> 3:35:10.200]  and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals. And that's why they
[3:35:10.200 --> 3:35:14.280]  don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because it's so simple. You
[3:35:14.280 --> 3:35:18.520]  won't be under their control anymore. Well, the vitamin-mineral fusion, the highest quality
[3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:23.520]  vitamin-mineral fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock

[3:36:58.120 --> 3:37:08.120]  Summit Dark News with Paul Joseph Watson. Well, Piers Morgan is out. He's officially
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:15.400]  been canceled. He dared to criticise the patron saint of Woke in the form of Meghan Markle,
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:19.880]  the archetype that they're now desperately protecting, beautifying. This is the person
[3:37:19.880 --> 3:37:25.120]  beyond reproach. Despite the fact that she's been caught lying time and time and again,
[3:37:25.120 --> 3:37:30.240]  we have to believe her claim that she was suicidal, that she's oppressed, living in
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:35.480]  a multi-million dollar mansion in Hollywood at this point. We have to believe that. We
[3:37:35.480 --> 3:37:44.120]  have to show the line. Interesting that Morgan pandered to these pro-lockdown narratives for
[3:37:44.120 --> 3:37:50.680]  the entirety of the past year. He was on the side of the deep state, the lockdown establishment.
[3:37:50.680 --> 3:37:55.760]  In that context, he faced no problems whatsoever. But as soon as he criticised the patron saint
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:38:01.880]  of Woke, Meghan Markle, he was out the door. Despite the fact that the majority of the
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:07.120]  British people agree with Piers Morgan, that basically she's a grifter, she's a liar.
[3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:14.040]  This is out of spite online. The British people want a hard Megxit, a YouGov poll released
[3:38:14.040 --> 3:38:20.320]  shortly before the couple's interview with Oprah, showed 23% have not very much sympathy
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:26.760]  for them. That's Harry and Meghan Markle and 33% have no sympathy for them. Just 29% said
[3:38:26.760 --> 3:38:31.360]  they sympathise with Harry and Meghan's plight such as it is. Then they did another poll
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:36.040]  after the interview aired, which again showed that the majority of the British people agreed
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:41.120]  with Piers Morgan. 47% of respondents said it was inappropriate for the pair to take
[3:38:41.120 --> 3:38:46.600]  part in the interview, while just 21% said it was appropriate. So the majority of Brits
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:54.080]  agree with Piers Morgan. He went on this year long jag promoting lockdown despite its many
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:39:01.840]  myriad harmful impacts. But as soon as he crossed that red line of criticising the goddess,
[3:39:01.840 --> 3:39:07.880]  the new Diana Meghan Markle, he was out the door. Piers Morgan cancelled. Good morning,
[3:39:07.880 --> 3:39:13.360]  Britain House quits ITV after storming off set during the show. Looks like they gave
[3:39:13.360 --> 3:39:18.920]  him a deal where he could claim that he decided to leave rather than they fired him. So that
[3:39:18.920 --> 3:39:24.800]  happened just a couple of hours ago. Sicking with the subject of woke, though, there's
[3:39:24.800 --> 3:39:29.360]  an article here out of Sky News. Now, of course, we get this controversy every year in America
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:36.240]  with the Oscars. Oscar's so white to the point where they literally had to have 50% or more
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:41.880]  of the nominees be black or ethnic minority, despite the fact that what America is not
[3:39:41.880 --> 3:39:48.640]  34% white. 13% black, by the way, which if you look at the Oscar nominations over the
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:54.120]  past couple of decades is precisely in line with the black population of the United States.
[3:39:54.120 --> 3:40:00.400]  It's roughly around 13% of nominations or it was until a few years ago. So it was actually
[3:40:00.400 --> 3:40:05.360]  diverse. It was representative of the number of black people in America being nominated
[3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:12.480]  for Oscars. Well, now we have a similar situation in the UK, where the bathers, which by the
[3:40:12.480 --> 3:40:20.680]  way now have to not only hire BAME actresses and actors and producers, writers, staffers
[3:40:20.680 --> 3:40:27.640]  for all their movie productions, they also have to represent BAME narratives in the movies.
[3:40:27.640 --> 3:40:31.840]  So now they've got it down to the level of indoctrination where they literally have to
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:40.240]  amend the script to satisfy this woke mob, headline out of Sky News, BAFTA Awards 2021,
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:48.720]  Nomadland and Rocks lead nominations as improvements made on diversity. Improvements made. Okay,
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:55.200]  let's let's break down mathematically how those improvements have percolated into this
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:41:01.080]  controversy because this followed the hashtag BAFTA so white criticism, which took place
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:08.080]  last year. So now to address that, it says the majority of the 24 nominees are from
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:13.720]  black, Asian and ethnic minority groups. The short list of the bigger world best film features
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:17.120]  of the father, the Mauritian, the promising young woman and the trial of the Chicago seven
[3:41:17.120 --> 3:41:23.400]  as well as Nomadland. So they've made over half of the 24 nominees for the British film
[3:41:23.400 --> 3:41:31.200]  awards, black or ethnic minority. And they call this, and I quote, an improvement on
[3:41:31.200 --> 3:41:40.120]  diversity. Okay, the last census in the United Kingdom showed that 87% of the population
[3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:47.880]  was white. So if you want true diversity, if you want true representation of all races,
[3:41:47.880 --> 3:41:55.280]  that's what it's about. That's what we're told it's about equality. On average, 87% of
[3:41:55.280 --> 3:41:59.840]  the nominations for actors, actresses, you can't say actresses anymore, you have to call
[3:41:59.840 --> 3:42:07.160]  them actors, would be for white people. But no, they've literally made it more than 50%
[3:42:07.160 --> 3:42:15.720]  non white people. And they call it diversity when 87% of the population is white. It's
[3:42:15.720 --> 3:42:21.280]  like when the Scottish Justice Secretary or Home Secretary, the one who's trying to pass
[3:42:21.280 --> 3:42:26.680]  the hate speech law, which will literally criminal criminalize dinner party conversations,
[3:42:26.680 --> 3:42:31.400]  went on a rant, you went through all the major positions in the Scottish government, pointing
[3:42:31.400 --> 3:42:38.360]  out that most of them were filled by white people. Yeah, Scotland is 98% white, they're
[3:42:38.360 --> 3:42:43.440]  going to generally be filled by white people. That's like going to Nigeria and complaining
[3:42:43.440 --> 3:42:48.800]  that there aren't enough white people in the Nigerian government. So they've made over
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:57.040]  half of the nominees black. It's racially discriminatory tokenism. If I was a talented
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:43:03.440]  BAME actor, I would want to be recognized for my talent, not for some blasphetic, pathetic,
[3:43:03.440 --> 3:43:08.920]  superficial, virtue signaling tokenism. But that's what's happening with the Baftas. Oh,
[3:43:08.920 --> 3:43:14.960]  but it's so diverse. We've eliminated more than 50% of white people from the nominations
[3:43:14.960 --> 3:43:24.600]  because we're so anti racist. Okay. Meanwhile, normal gets canceled as Unilever vows to drop
[3:43:24.600 --> 3:43:31.440]  word from all brands. Now this is a corporation, by the way, which has been embroiled in multiple
[3:43:31.440 --> 3:43:40.320]  serious toxic waste, environmental deforestation, forced labor and child labor scandals over
[3:43:40.320 --> 3:43:48.560]  the past 10 years. But they've taken the knee to the woke mob they've caved they've submitted.
[3:43:48.560 --> 3:43:54.640]  And now they're joining the cause to ban offensive words. So I guess all those actual social
[3:43:54.640 --> 3:44:00.280]  justice and environmental scandals will now be forgotten by the left. Because the next
[3:44:00.280 --> 3:44:04.880]  thing to be canceled is apparently the word normal with corporate giant Unilever vowing
[3:44:04.880 --> 3:44:10.200]  to ban the use of the description on all its products. They said that brands would remove
[3:44:10.200 --> 3:44:16.400]  the word normal from advertising and packaging. So basically, you know, you get a skincare
[3:44:16.400 --> 3:44:23.080]  brand, which is for normal skin, you get a shampoo brand, which is for normal hair, meaning
[3:44:23.080 --> 3:44:30.120]  non greasy, non dry. Now that's not allowed anymore. You can't use the word normal. It's
[3:44:30.120 --> 3:44:35.880]  discriminatory. It's hateful to call anything normal. And so now this corporate giant has
[3:44:35.880 --> 3:44:42.240]  said, and they put out put out this sanctimonious video promo, saying that they're going to
[3:44:42.240 --> 3:44:50.200]  ban the word normal forever more. Once again, we have major corporations like Unilever,
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:56.760]  added ass, Nike, all engaging in this rampant virtue signaling, we had boohoo, the fashion
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:04.160]  brand boohoo last week come out with yet another forced labor scandal. This is one of the corporations
[3:45:04.160 --> 3:45:10.520]  that went to a great lengths to virtue signal about how much they care about black lives.
[3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:18.120]  They posted the black square blackout Tuesday. They donated to black lives matter organizations
[3:45:18.120 --> 3:45:26.520]  while simultaneously employing slave labor in their factories in Leicester, an area of
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:31.360]  the United Kingdom, a town in the United Kingdom, which has a large minority population. So
[3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:38.600]  while they're simultaneously abusing employees using slave labor in their factories, they're
[3:45:38.600 --> 3:45:44.600]  posting the black square on Twitter and Instagram. So they're completely forgiven. The exact
[3:45:44.600 --> 3:45:50.880]  same situation with Unilever, which I listed some of their scandals in this article. If
[3:45:50.880 --> 3:45:55.400]  I had listed them all, it would have gone on for about five pages. They've been blamed
[3:45:55.400 --> 3:46:00.480]  for massive deforestation in Indonesia because they purchased palm oil from this company
[3:46:00.480 --> 3:46:05.560]  that was destroying the forest. They were named as one of the world's top 10 plastic
[3:46:05.560 --> 3:46:11.680]  polluters. They had to issue a court settlement where they had to pay a bunch of employees
[3:46:11.680 --> 3:46:17.560]  in an Indian subsidiary, a factory where they literally dumped toxic mercury waste into
[3:46:17.560 --> 3:46:25.840]  the rivers. And they were also involved in a forced labor and child labor scandal, again
[3:46:25.840 --> 3:46:30.880]  based off of that subsidiary that was involved in the palm oil. So they can literally employ
[3:46:30.880 --> 3:46:37.680]  child labor, forced labor. They can dump toxic waste in the river. They can be engaged in
[3:46:37.680 --> 3:46:47.560]  massive deforestation in Indonesia. But they banned a word. So all is forgiven, right?
[3:46:47.560 --> 3:46:51.440]  Absolutely incredible. And we see the same thing with all these world corporations. They
[3:46:51.440 --> 3:46:57.440]  put out the sanctimonious virtue signaling to get the free multimillion dollar advertising.
[3:46:57.440 --> 3:47:03.520]  They're all praised on social media. You scratch half an inch below the surface and there's
[3:47:03.520 --> 3:47:10.120]  rampant anti-social justice behavior amongst all these world corporations. But again, it's
[3:47:10.120 --> 3:47:16.120]  glossed over. It's hidden under the carpet because they posted the black square. Meanwhile,
[3:47:16.120 --> 3:47:20.000]  Burger King women belong in the kitchen tweet backfires horrendously. You can go and read
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:26.400]  about that on summitnews.com. International Women's Day ruined once again because these
[3:47:26.400 --> 3:47:36.960]  global corporations basically want to celebrate themselves.
