[05:02.720 --> 05:06.560]  is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[05:06.560 --> 05:09.920]  and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[05:09.920 --> 05:13.680]  and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a breadline if you have your
[05:13.680 --> 05:17.280]  own bread you'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for female to take
[05:17.280 --> 05:20.960]  care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected
[05:20.960 --> 05:24.480]  representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest so they
[05:24.480 --> 05:28.240]  ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they
[05:28.240 --> 05:33.320]  voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[05:33.320 --> 05:37.120]  American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[05:37.120 --> 05:40.920]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities
[05:40.920 --> 05:46.040]  particularly food beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation
[05:46.040 --> 05:49.840]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4
[05:49.840 --> 05:53.960]  billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as
[05:53.960 --> 05:57.400]  if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our
[05:57.400 --> 06:00.600]  government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[06:00.600 --> 06:04.440]  shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[06:04.440 --> 06:07.800]  whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready
[06:07.800 --> 06:11.400]  everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans have to choose between
[06:11.400 --> 06:14.840]  buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it
[06:14.840 --> 06:18.840]  takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[06:18.840 --> 06:21.720]  listening it's very important for you understand that by having a supply of
[06:21.720 --> 06:25.320]  storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[06:25.320 --> 06:29.240]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[06:29.240 --> 06:32.440]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you

[34:05.480 --> 34:09.000]  little bit out of control sometimes not all the state police a lot of them are
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.720]  nice actually let me out of quite a few tickets but the point is is that uh
[34:13.720 --> 34:17.720]  is that we have jaren nyhart in here uh with us jaren uh
[34:17.720 --> 34:20.440]  tell us exactly i mean you talk to him personally
[34:20.440 --> 34:23.480]  what thomas mcdonald the producer who was confronted by this guy
[34:23.480 --> 34:26.200]  this was also in the main area with there was some other witnesses
[34:26.200 --> 34:29.320]  what exactly was said what exactly happened about an hour after it happened
[34:29.320 --> 34:33.000]  i walked into the studio uh saw the cops outside walked inside and asked
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.200]  thomas what the deal was he said well guy showed me a gun i said well tell me
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.600]  the story so uh the account from thomas was that
[34:40.600 --> 34:44.280]  the gentleman came in wanted to talk to jeff ward thomas pulled him aside
[34:44.280 --> 34:47.880]  to speak with him uh he said you couldn't talk to jeff ward he's not in
[34:47.880 --> 34:51.960]  let me stop you there how did he get through the security door i mean why
[34:51.960 --> 34:55.640]  did they let him in well thomas said he took him to a conference room which is
[34:55.640 --> 34:59.080]  you can walk into the lobby obviously in request anything i guess he took it on
[34:59.080 --> 35:03.160]  himself to go out past the security you need the little passcode to get into
[35:03.160 --> 35:07.320]  the studio area he went outside of that uh to a conference room to just talk to
[35:07.320 --> 35:10.360]  him see what he wanted oh so he let him in the conference room yeah before the
[35:10.360 --> 35:13.640]  gun was shown apparently also he got in the open conference room right there in
[35:13.640 --> 35:17.560]  the side of sales office exactly uh he didn't let him in the main room no no
[35:17.560 --> 35:20.440]  he was asking to talk to jeff ward so thomas went out there to talk to him see
[35:20.440 --> 35:24.360]  what he wanted um from what thomas said the guy was very very concerned that
[35:24.360 --> 35:29.720]  the dps was tracking him following him uh very concerned very worried um
[35:29.720 --> 35:33.560]  that's when thomas said you know jeff's not in uh you can't you know you can't
[35:33.560 --> 35:38.040]  talk to him but we have a show alex jones show on sunday you should call into
[35:38.040 --> 35:41.320]  and the guy basically the guy's point was he just wants to be heard
[35:41.320 --> 35:45.640]  once your name came up from what thomas said is when he pulled up his uh
[35:45.640 --> 35:50.680]  his shirt showed a gun and then uh said that he might go postal or he feels
[35:50.680 --> 35:54.280]  like going postal now was now was jeff ward there yesterday or is he on
[35:54.280 --> 35:57.000]  vacation um no he's there but he he comes in about
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.960]  three o'clock so this is about two o'clock but he's not there today
[35:59.960 --> 36:03.880]  i should be there today i haven't heard anything other than that
[36:03.880 --> 36:08.200]  well he needs to come on this show that'd be great i mean he he's the uh
[36:08.200 --> 36:12.920]  former ut kicker and nfl kicker and a local talk show host here in oscar for
[36:12.920 --> 36:16.920]  those who don't know who we're talking about uh because i want to specifically
[36:16.920 --> 36:19.960]  i mean he may not want to make a big deal out of this to draw more crazies out
[36:19.960 --> 36:22.920]  but i think it's interesting so i mean i guess the person we want to talk to is
[36:22.920 --> 36:29.480]  thomas mcdonnell uh because uh i mean i guess if if jeff wasn't even well
[36:29.480 --> 36:32.360]  well i mean jeff had to be there it was about to go on air in 15 minutes i guess
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.120]  he was in the back well he usually walks in right about right about the time
[36:36.120 --> 36:39.560]  show starts but uh thomas from what thomas said this is about two o'clock
[36:39.560 --> 36:43.320]  so this happened before jeff got there i know that for a fact
[36:43.320 --> 36:48.600]  okay so the the the newspaper's wrong and it wasn't in 245
[36:48.600 --> 36:51.160]  could have been around that time but like i said jeff comes in about three
[36:51.160 --> 36:55.000]  o'clock he told me that thomas was upset when he got well well my old no
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.800]  kidding you got some i wonder why this guy got kicked out of the dps
[36:59.800 --> 37:03.160]  and see this is the type of guy i'm not saying he did it this is the type of guy
[37:03.160 --> 37:07.160]  they need to look at for the governor's mansion fire this is the type of inside
[37:07.160 --> 37:11.560]  job i was talking about and then when the texas monthly interviewed me about that
[37:11.560 --> 37:14.600]  i kept explaining to them i'm there's different types of inside jobs i'm not
[37:14.600 --> 37:19.320]  even necessarily saying i said 10 chance the state police set fire to this
[37:19.320 --> 37:23.000]  higher up to blame the head of the dps and kick him out because
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.160]  the head of the dps was trying to expose the the state run pedophile rings
[37:27.160 --> 37:30.360]  the texas youth commission you can't make this stuff up folks if you don't
[37:30.360 --> 37:33.000]  believe me just google texas youth commission for those that live in texas
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.760]  they know all about it giant rape rooms selling the children the state police
[37:36.760 --> 37:40.920]  did try to stop that so they basically set up and
[37:40.920 --> 37:43.960]  ran out the director of the dps because he wouldn't buckle to the
[37:43.960 --> 37:47.480]  commission the state set up to cover it up that's the backside on that
[37:47.480 --> 37:51.240]  so that happened right around then and they blamed the head of the dps
[37:51.240 --> 37:56.360]  for the mansion being fire bombed wind had two security fences up and they
[37:56.360 --> 38:00.280]  claimed somebody threw 50 yards of mall off cocktail and then it took 18 minutes
[38:00.280 --> 38:03.960]  for the state police to respond when they were in a building on the compound
[38:03.960 --> 38:08.520]  the wheelhouse as it's called uh so i was saying this is a disgruntled employee
[38:08.520 --> 38:13.880]  that's probably i'd say 60 chance disgruntled security disgruntled
[38:13.880 --> 38:19.880]  dps mentally ill soldier you know now dps uh
[38:19.880 --> 38:25.400]  and i said you know 40 chance it's some local anarchist that's on record
[38:25.400 --> 38:29.080]  that's what i said and i said 10 chance it was a total inside job
[38:29.080 --> 38:32.600]  uh so this is the kind of guy i'm not saying he did it i'm not even saying he's
[38:32.600 --> 38:35.640]  a suspect this is the kind of guy you look at
[38:35.640 --> 38:39.560]  for for for fire bombing the governor's mansion
[38:39.560 --> 38:44.760]  these type of people nutcase former cops i'm telling you right now jaren what
[38:44.760 --> 38:48.760]  do you say to that what makes the cops so nuts that's what i'd say to that
[38:48.760 --> 38:52.200]  why would we have so many cases of dps officers
[38:52.200 --> 38:56.920]  flipping out well the average person can't handle power
[38:56.920 --> 38:59.960]  i mean power goes to people's heads what do they say in spider-man with great
[38:59.960 --> 39:03.480]  power comes great responsibility and i mean we we were talking
[39:03.480 --> 39:06.600]  during the break uh i mean for folks and i mean i don't know
[39:06.600 --> 39:09.720]  this happening other parts of the country but is it not speed racer out on
[39:09.720 --> 39:13.880]  the highway i've seen it a few times actually in georgetown
[39:13.880 --> 39:17.640]  uh had to uh had to call the cops on a cop
[39:17.640 --> 39:21.480]  and got no assistance oh really what was the lordship doing
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.640]  well he was uh he was actually a retirement community a kind of golf cart
[39:25.640 --> 39:29.320]  community and he went past me about 15 miles over the limit
[39:29.320 --> 39:33.080]  i called uh basically called 911 to report him
[39:33.080 --> 39:36.360]  kind of uh upset about a ticket i got it a little earlier maybe a little
[39:36.360 --> 39:39.960]  retribution but i i called them and and they wanted my name and
[39:39.960 --> 39:42.920]  information i said look i don't want to get all i want to do
[39:42.920 --> 39:46.440]  is just report this and have somebody stop it he's flying past
[39:46.440 --> 39:50.680]  golf carts on a main street uh they they would not take the report without
[39:50.680 --> 39:54.360]  any of my information asked them why they need that they said well we you
[39:54.360 --> 39:56.680]  know we need to verify i said look let me talk to somebody else they said we
[39:56.680 --> 39:59.320]  can't let you talk to anybody else 911 operator
[39:59.320 --> 40:02.600]  unless you give us your name first and last name

[41:46.520 --> 41:51.240]  uh controlling the human mind now and i was just concerned about the
[41:51.240 --> 41:58.520]  digital tv mandate this february 17 2009 i've read articles where
[41:58.520 --> 42:03.400]  they would be able to control the population and the uh
[42:03.400 --> 42:08.120]  with the technology utilized by harp and the transmitters and i just wanted
[42:08.120 --> 42:13.320]  your thoughts on that it is an absolute scientific fact
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.480]  taught in all major rtf classes at any major university
[42:17.480 --> 42:22.760]  that subliminal messages in radio tv and billboards
[42:22.760 --> 42:26.280]  have been in heavy use for at least 60 years
[42:26.280 --> 42:33.160]  and that the exact uh oscillation chosen for us televisions
[42:33.160 --> 42:37.240]  uh was arrived at in the 1950s by the pentagon
[42:37.240 --> 42:41.080]  uh in tests that have now been declassified about how to put you into a
[42:41.080 --> 42:45.400]  dream state or a highly suggestible state now
[42:45.400 --> 42:49.480]  with the plasma or the lcd tv's the high death
[42:49.480 --> 42:54.360]  it has magnified that and before i could watch television and then catch
[42:54.360 --> 42:57.000]  myself every 20 minutes kind of going into zombie mode
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.320]  and and you know drooling now uh i'll get on the treadmill every day or the
[43:01.320 --> 43:07.560]  stair stepper and uh watch uh the tv that's the only
[43:07.560 --> 43:12.040]  time i really watch it and and and literally i i i feel
[43:12.040 --> 43:15.320]  myself instantly shifting into subconscious mode
[43:15.320 --> 43:19.160]  and and i have to kind of look away so it is
[43:19.160 --> 43:23.800]  devastating devastating and that's only one layer
[43:23.800 --> 43:27.800]  and i told the story of uh we were shooting some some footage for american
[43:27.800 --> 43:31.880]  drug war inside the university of texas
[43:31.880 --> 43:35.560]  psychology department building it was new at the time about seven years ago six
[43:35.560 --> 43:38.840]  years ago and kevin was first working on that
[43:38.840 --> 43:42.520]  and so our friend is let's just say hi up in there i'm gonna leave it at that
[43:42.520 --> 43:45.800]  that's how we had access and he would only let let us in the in the in the
[43:45.800 --> 43:50.440]  in the unclassified areas almost all of it was all
[43:50.440 --> 43:53.960]  i mean it would say on the door of each lab
[43:53.960 --> 43:58.120]  that it was a research project of DARPA DARPA DARPA DARPA and it was all
[43:58.120 --> 44:04.120]  about how to just flicker tv rates how to mesmerize monkeys and they also had
[44:04.120 --> 44:07.800]  labs where they'd bring in men women they would do sexual test where they'd
[44:07.800 --> 44:11.240]  hook all these uh wires up to their sexual organs
[44:11.240 --> 44:15.400]  uh and i'm just getting a tour of this just to see what subliminals what
[44:15.400 --> 44:19.080]  aroused them because they arouse you and then show you a beer
[44:19.080 --> 44:22.280]  you know dripping with uh you know ice cold water
[44:22.280 --> 44:26.440]  and and ice cubes drifting down the side because they know if they can trigger
[44:26.440 --> 44:29.720]  certain hormone responses in the brain and put another image on
[44:29.720 --> 44:34.440]  itself but this was all department of defense now that's just one building
[44:34.440 --> 44:38.360]  crawling a huge hive and then you go into the next floor and it'll be
[44:38.360 --> 44:41.320]  passive retina scanner scanning your eyes from
[44:41.320 --> 44:46.280]  50 feet away in the stores and you go in the next area and it'd be rfid
[44:46.280 --> 44:50.280]  you know uh and then you go in the next area and it would be
[44:50.280 --> 44:55.400]  sexual arousal uh through flicker rates and then
[44:55.400 --> 44:58.680]  i'm not going to get into the monkeys because
[44:58.680 --> 45:01.720]  because i don't want to get anybody in trouble i'm not saying i was allowed to
[45:01.720 --> 45:05.800]  see anything that's restricted or anything monkeys
[45:05.800 --> 45:09.720]  chained down with wires into their brains and that's in another building
[45:09.720 --> 45:15.640]  they have video feeds of this hell pit but it's all how to crush america how to
[45:15.640 --> 45:19.240]  savagely grab your minds and look at the public they're like zombies they're in
[45:19.240 --> 45:21.720]  a trance hitting them hard hitting them hard hitting them
[45:21.720 --> 45:24.760]  with chemicals in the food and water hitting them with the television sets

[45:28.920 --> 45:33.160]  does that answer your question yes i did not i was just concerned because i
[45:33.160 --> 45:37.640]  remember what happened in 1991 when you get the droves of the iraqi's just
[45:37.640 --> 45:40.520]  surrendering and you know the united states
[45:40.520 --> 45:45.000]  military didn't even fire a shot so that answers my question i'm a big fan it's

[45:51.080 --> 45:55.080]  god bless you sir i appreciate the call you know the only analogy i have for
[45:55.080 --> 46:00.440]  this is body snatchers did you get the body snatcher clips i sent john
[46:00.440 --> 46:04.360]  we're gonna play that later in the third hour please remind me
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.680]  and i'm not saying that on the solar winds they came
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.840]  from a dying planet to evolve and take over earth
[46:12.840 --> 46:16.520]  i'm not saying please new york times don't don't say i'm
[46:16.520 --> 46:19.640]  you know believing that aliens have attacked i'm saying it might as well be
[46:19.640 --> 46:22.920]  aliens it's a subgroup of our own species
[46:22.920 --> 46:27.560]  who is aberrant it's a class of psychopaths building a hellish world
[46:27.560 --> 46:31.560]  and they've got the public mesmerized like the body snatchers got them
[46:31.560 --> 46:35.720]  and uh no amount of evil in their face will wake them up
[46:35.720 --> 46:40.120]  they're poisoning us they're engaging in all sorts of psyops i mean what we know
[46:40.120 --> 46:44.120]  they're doing is off the charts evil
[46:44.120 --> 46:47.640]  and they've got the fbi the police the military the general public the yuppies
[46:47.640 --> 46:51.160]  that support all this just ready to do anything the government says
[46:51.160 --> 46:54.920]  go along with anything and and and we are in a
[46:54.920 --> 46:59.160]  psychotronic warfare zone the pentagon openly has declared the american people
[46:59.160 --> 47:05.720]  their enemy north com is ruling us i mean what do you say to that
[47:05.720 --> 47:10.120]  i'm gonna talk about it later uh let's go ahead and uh
[47:10.120 --> 47:15.640]  take another phone call here james in texas you're on the year worldwide

[47:33.720 --> 47:38.440]  a final transmission of the year we're having a strong finish
[47:38.440 --> 47:42.520]  and we're dedicating ourselves to crush the new world order in the new year
[47:42.520 --> 47:47.320]  that's right um before you were talking about roman state craft i found that
[47:47.320 --> 47:51.080]  very interesting and i've grabbed everything that i can on the subject
[47:51.080 --> 47:55.880]  uh what books would you recommend that i read
[47:55.880 --> 48:01.880]  you know i read uh... gibbons rise and fall the roman empire
[48:01.880 --> 48:06.600]  and because i'm so busy what i would do is not not having a lot of time to read
[48:06.600 --> 48:09.960]  um because i'll open a good book you know at midnight when i get home for my
[48:09.960 --> 48:13.160]  second shift at work so i'll go home at four five see my children come back at
[48:13.160 --> 48:15.800]  eight or nine you know work till midnight two three in the morning sometimes
[48:15.800 --> 48:20.040]  i've uh been with side issue i'm trying to explain
[48:20.040 --> 48:23.800]  how i do it i have bought probably i don't know
[48:23.800 --> 48:31.480]  15 books on tape cd uh of uh roman histories
[48:31.480 --> 48:35.400]  and listen to those in the car because you'll be surprised how much you're in
[48:35.400 --> 48:38.280]  the car going to the grocery store going to the cleaners
[48:38.280 --> 48:41.320]  uh you know going to the hardware store going to work
[48:41.320 --> 48:45.800]  you can listen to a 15 hour book on tape and just a few weeks in your car
[48:45.800 --> 48:50.120]  uh so that's what i do and i mean there's been so many titles i've read
[48:50.120 --> 48:54.680]  uh i uh i read of course in high school the battle for gall i re-read it
[48:54.680 --> 48:57.960]  twice now those are letters from julia cesar back to
[48:57.960 --> 49:02.360]  roam when he was out on the germania front and the gall front
[49:02.360 --> 49:06.040]  uh and then i read some of his other extensive letters online at
[49:06.040 --> 49:10.280]  universities a lot of these works are online for free
[49:10.280 --> 49:15.240]  and uh but i mean i mean there's so many titles and so many different
[49:15.240 --> 49:21.240]  perspectives uh but uh and there's you know there's
[49:21.240 --> 49:26.440]  really three different roman periods uh and i don't plan to be any particular
[49:26.440 --> 49:29.880]  expert on that i've studied world war two history probably read
[49:29.880 --> 49:33.800]  70 80 books on that i probably read more than 50 books on british naval
[49:33.800 --> 49:37.080]  history my wife just gave me another one under
[49:37.080 --> 49:39.880]  under an enemy flag i believe the title that she walked in this morning and
[49:39.880 --> 49:44.280]  handed to me i haven't read it yet uh
[49:44.280 --> 49:49.720]  but i mean i mean specifically uh i mean have you read the battle for gall
[49:49.720 --> 49:53.320]  that's that's a pretty basic primer
[49:53.320 --> 49:56.360]  did i also got an audio book because i spent a lot of time in the car
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.280]  of meditations by marcus aurelius that was pretty amazing
[50:00.280 --> 50:04.040]  yeah stay there let's come back let's let's come back and hear about that

[53:25.960 --> 53:29.960]  it's hard to deal with but i mean look at the society we live in
[53:29.960 --> 53:35.400]  spider goats human animal cross species clones
[53:35.400 --> 53:42.360]  jet airplanes computers whole dancing new world order devils
[53:42.360 --> 53:45.320]  we're living in a wild time ladies and gentlemen
[53:45.320 --> 53:53.000]  and it's going to get a lot crazier we live in a society of decadence slothful
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.480]  diversion and our humanity is being stripped away from us
[53:57.480 --> 54:03.080]  so that we will accept the mass murder of the new world order
[54:03.080 --> 54:06.520]  all right let's go back to the calls here um
[54:06.520 --> 54:11.400]  you were reading Reflections by Marcus Aurelius i haven't uh
[54:11.400 --> 54:15.160]  read that or listened to that but i have uh checked out
[54:15.160 --> 54:18.360]  some of the uh historians some of the roman leaders
[54:18.360 --> 54:21.880]  writings some of their memoirs and again it's just
[54:21.880 --> 54:26.440]  engrossing to hear about the intrigue the subterfuge the secret societies
[54:26.440 --> 54:30.760]  the decadence of the society the old roman class trying to hold it together
[54:30.760 --> 54:33.960]  uh the insane god emperors going you know going wild
[54:33.960 --> 54:38.840]  uh but uh please continue uh with the comments you were making sir
[54:38.840 --> 54:42.600]  oh yeah the um he was going on about public education
[54:42.600 --> 54:47.240]  sports and all this other sort of stuff and it is used very similar with some
[54:47.240 --> 54:50.520]  of the things that i believe in some of the things that you express on the show
[54:50.520 --> 54:53.320]  and i thought that would be something that the listeners might uh might like
[54:53.320 --> 54:58.040]  to pick up and check out yeah why don't you do this i mean i again i
[54:58.040 --> 55:00.920]  this is what i just think i want to do and i don't ever do it you ought to
[55:00.920 --> 55:05.000]  grab a few clips of key parts put them up on youtube
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.200]  uh you know from that book on tape and that'll promote their book on tape
[55:08.200 --> 55:11.800]  anyway you know grab a few minutes of it and then we'll play a clip of it on air
[55:11.800 --> 55:15.400]  and plug the book on tape that'll be wonderful
[55:15.400 --> 55:18.440]  i have one more question you were talking about the uh the eight year
[55:18.440 --> 55:22.040]  unruly governor and then the savior which which writing did that come from
[55:22.040 --> 55:25.080]  that's the one that i'm particularly interested in
[55:25.080 --> 55:29.320]  say that again uh you were talking about how in uh in room they'd have an
[55:29.320 --> 55:33.240]  unruly governor for eight years right and he'd come in be a tiring
[55:33.240 --> 55:36.520]  you know bringing all this uh horrible stuff on the people and then they bring
[55:36.520 --> 55:40.040]  in the savior and the people would accept more tyranny from the savior
[55:40.040 --> 55:44.520]  and yeah you know what happens especially
[55:44.520 --> 55:48.120]  you know i have almost a photographic memory if i look at a bill a piece of
[55:48.120 --> 55:51.880]  legislation commit it to memory and then talk about it three or four times the
[55:51.880 --> 55:55.560]  next few days then it becomes enlarged in my memory
[55:55.560 --> 55:59.400]  but things like books on tape or you know the cell phone rings you pick it up
[55:59.400 --> 56:03.560]  and you know turn the cd off uh or the ipod off
[56:03.560 --> 56:08.440]  uh it all just kind of mixes all together um
[56:08.440 --> 56:15.240]  i don't remember where i read that uh but i've seen similar things to that
[56:15.240 --> 56:18.840]  and when i was covering and i was being you know kind of broad brush i don't
[56:18.840 --> 56:23.240]  remember exactly how whatever book it was i was reading
[56:23.240 --> 56:27.640]  it was uh you know a an account from the time
[56:27.640 --> 56:31.320]  of tactics they would use with subjugated control populations
[56:31.320 --> 56:34.520]  and you know it was more of a general discussion you know it's the same thing
[56:34.520 --> 56:40.280]  if somebody asked me uh what is the caribbean's black slave
[56:40.280 --> 56:43.720]  owning manual about how to break black slaves
[56:43.720 --> 56:49.000]  uh i first probably 10 years ago saw a footnote about that
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.920]  in a university research article i don't remember where i want to say the
[56:52.920 --> 56:57.880]  university of chicago then i googled it or whatever search engine
[56:57.880 --> 57:02.840]  and found the manual itself and then it talked about how it was
[57:02.840 --> 57:09.480]  translated into english uh in the 1780s and used and adopted
[57:09.480 --> 57:13.080]  in south carolina and north carolina so i remember
[57:13.080 --> 57:16.360]  all of that and i remember the tactics used to break slaves
[57:16.360 --> 57:20.440]  and then i noticed it's the same tactics they used to break up families today
[57:20.440 --> 57:23.720]  uh but i don't remember i mean you know what i mean so much knowledge
[57:23.720 --> 57:28.360]  you have the knowledge but you don't remember even where exactly it came from
[57:28.360 --> 57:31.320]  right i know what you mean you read a lot of book but i mean what you're doing
[57:31.320 --> 57:33.960]  now though is look you're going and reading roman history
[57:33.960 --> 57:37.720]  and you're finding it says the things i said it was in there right

[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:57.800]  absolutely uh the journey of a thousand mile starts with that single step in
[1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:01.080]  the decision to make the step and so many people always wait to make it
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:04.680]  perfect to get it just right oh oh i've got to wait i've got a you know and they

[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:32.680]  john in florida you're on the air that's right i already coming through
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:37.720]  well listen uh you know i was uh electrician on the monsanto project
[1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:42.920]  where they made the milk hormone and uh here in Tampa they fired two guys uh
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:47.000]  well of two reporters and they got their own website about
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.960]  they were reporting on it so they just got through and fired them
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:54.520]  uh but you know that's right you wonder why you know the dad's five foot ten
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:58.520]  mama's five foot three but your daughters are seven feet tall or six and
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:02.120]  a half feet tall it's that growth hormone and it causes all sorts of
[1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:07.000]  problems and that's been proven but uh yeah fox news ordered their people to
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:11.320]  cover it up that's fox news reporters well you know when i was working on a
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.000]  project i couldn't believe how massive it was it was like seven huge buildings
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.600]  in two months into it i said uh what are they making here
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:22.600]  and they told me that and none none of the workers could believe it because
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:26.200]  they come off the farm and everything and they were going produce three times
[1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:29.400]  the amount of milk and these cows can't even walk yet because there's so much
[1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:33.400]  injected in them already you can eject another hormone in them
[1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:37.480]  uh it was about incredible but 12 years ago also heard this guy he came on out
[1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:40.920]  where he's from hold on i'm gonna hold you over i want to hear more about it
[1:03:40.920 --> 1:03:45.800]  let me tell you something if you don't drink the milk filled with scores of
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:49.480]  hormones and you don't eat GMO food that kills the rats that eat it
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:54.280]  you're with al-qaeda trust your government love them love made off
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:58.360]  let them steal all your pension funds you deserve it the government's doing it
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:03.320]  for your own good drink the hormone die of cancer
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:09.800]  go to the fema cap it's of the lord the government loves you
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:13.480]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:16.280]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever
[1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:19.880]  we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:22.280]  stand in a bread line if you have your own bread
[1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:25.640]  you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for fema to take care of your
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:28.520]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:31.640]  elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:34.200]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:38.200]  they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 million
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:42.200]  dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american and european
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:45.240]  banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:49.000]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.680]  particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi
[1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:56.680]  germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[1:04:56.680 --> 1:05:01.240]  until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast
[1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:05.400]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our
[1:05:05.400 --> 1:05:08.520]  government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:11.000]  shelves the stores have less food but jacka
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:14.600]  prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be
[1:05:14.600 --> 1:05:17.480]  prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:20.840]  one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[1:05:20.840 --> 1:05:23.560]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get
[1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:27.320]  prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's
[1:05:27.320 --> 1:05:30.520]  very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:33.880]  the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a
[1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:37.240]  mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:40.440]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:44.200]  you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from

[1:06:17.480 --> 1:06:21.080]  the genesis communications radio network probably presents
[1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:26.440]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:30.120]  all right john florida you say you worked on
[1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:34.920]  one of monsanto's bovine growth hormone facilities
[1:06:34.920 --> 1:06:37.720]  which of course the bovine growth hormone is almost identical to human
[1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:42.760]  growth hormone when they you know give bodybuilders the
[1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:47.080]  russians cheating back in the 60s it would be
[1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:50.040]  growth hormone out of human cadavers or out of monkeys
[1:06:50.040 --> 1:06:53.560]  then they tried to use it out of cows then they created synthetic growth
[1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:56.680]  hormones so yeah they pump them full of this
[1:06:56.680 --> 1:07:00.600]  synthetic growth hormone and it's been linked to all sorts of problems
[1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:05.640]  and that's why you've got all these massive increases in acromegaly
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:10.280]  type diseases bones diseases and you know just all
[1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:14.760]  sorts of problems going on and that's why your little girls that
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:18.520]  should be you know five foot five or six foot seven now
[1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:23.240]  and that's why you know your little boys have got all these problems
[1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:26.360]  and not to mention what all the other hormones do making your boys
[1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:29.720]  effeminate and your women hyper feminine
[1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:33.160]  and then women wonder why they're they literally get breast cancer and their
[1:07:33.160 --> 1:07:35.720]  breasts rot off and they die and they go in a hole in the ground
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:38.840]  and life's over because the black ops are working well
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:41.320]  that's how it all me that's how these savage eugenicists
[1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:45.560]  hits you and they hit you hard and they're going to go on murdering you
[1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:49.400]  and murdering you and murdering you because you're too weak-minded
[1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:53.880]  to admit the real world you're living in with this nightmare could end overnight
[1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:57.960]  if we would just wake up to the reality
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:01.480]  you think it's normal to have cows producing two three times the milk they
[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:07.480]  should giant udders the size of
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:12.440]  two or three times their size and then you know why they pasteurize milk they
[1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:16.680]  pass laws we have to pasteurize it because before they pasteurized
[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:19.720]  they had less problems with milk but you had to keep it clean you had to have
[1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:23.320]  the tube in clean but now the feces can get in there
[1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:27.880]  the blood the posh is these cows just swell up and
[1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:32.120]  blood and posh just pours into the milk and then they just cook that stuff they
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:34.920]  cook it they they they boil it and boil it and
[1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:39.320]  boil it and pasteurize it and then it becomes a heart clogging
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:43.640]  chemical but natural milk is very very good for you but you're not allowed to
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:46.760]  have that the SWAT team comes if you want it
[1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:51.800]  you're going to drink hormone pus blood and you're going to like it
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:56.200]  is that clear all right good we're having a nice show today
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:08:59.960]  i'm fired up i'm sick of all this evil and i make the commitment in the new
[1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:04.760]  year to fight the new world order that much harder
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:08.520]  all right excuse me john and florida go ahead and finish up
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:14.520]  tell me more about the about the bovine growth hormone facility
[1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:18.280]  well it was a real shocker because when i asked everybody you know they were
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:23.480]  workers they were like people from the uh... just like the blue collardale
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:27.000]  and uh... it was like a silence that went over them because i started there
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.480]  like maybe two or three months before they were on it
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:32.520]  and they didn't even want to tell me what we were working on
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:35.480]  in a way because people needed jobs and stuff but it was so
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:39.880]  such an ultra modern facility and i looked at their store rooms that were
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:42.520]  biggest football fields and i said what's going in there it's a very
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:45.480]  frigid way i said i couldn't believe the energy they're doing this with it's
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:48.840]  like it was insanity uh...
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:53.160]  that's where they're going to store the hormone and it's going to be in a
[1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:57.320]  injected pack uh... already put into the um...
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:01.000]  syringe so when they ship it out it'll be refrigerated
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.400]  and to the farmers and i said well this is so big it'll probably be worldwide
[1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:08.600]  i mean this is like covers you know
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:12.680]  the ideas couldn't even believe it but uh... it was that big and
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:16.680]  and that's my first thing with monsanto really actually seeing how
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:22.120]  just unbelievably corrupt they are but uh...
[1:10:22.120 --> 1:10:25.640]  you know i think what you know and another guy like uh... just to get into
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:29.240]  the uh... militaristic of this or the militia part of it
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:33.240]  was somebody twelve years ago was uh... i was still in a vehicle and came
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:37.720]  to look at it and he said there's already blue helmeted chinese forces
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:42.520]  nato forces on our soil and he kept going on and on and on i said what do you
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:46.120]  talk about and he goes well me and you are patriots but they're building
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:48.520]  center rangers in indiana for me and you
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:51.400]  this is twelve years ago from somebody i didn't even know all right well let me
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:54.360]  look i appreciate your calling me comment on that
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:58.920]  it was in the rocky mountain is the Denver post

[1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:09.080]  the governor let me go back to the headline it was
[1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:11.560]  governor
[1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:15.400]  says incinerators ready for the dead

[1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:21.240]  somebody find that that was a rocky mountain news headline
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:24.120]  but that's very close to it and will somebody post that in the prison
[1:11:24.120 --> 1:11:27.560]  planet dot com forum please help me
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:31.960]  we all need to help to contribute that's how we're going to beat these bastards
[1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:36.360]  and uh... yes what do you think china has been given the panamocano
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:39.480]  what i think china has been given our deep water ports what i think the sun
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:42.760]  of the chinese president runs the long beach naval base
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:46.120]  why do you think all this is happening this is globalism they're
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:49.880]  selling us out right now
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:52.680]  they're sending out a bunch of arrogant corrupt bureaucrats that think it's
[1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:55.640]  funny the bankers are looting everything
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:58.760]  it's so horrible
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:05.320]  now finishing up with the whole situation with genetic engineering
[1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:08.360]  google
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:12.680]  how aspartame is made and you will be on university websites you will see
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:18.600]  photos of it it is ecoli bacteria

[1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:21.400]  you know throughout history is to try and give people
[1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:27.240]  a common enemy and i think all these weak minded people will easily believe

[1:25:57.160 --> 1:26:01.480]  bunch of degenerate control freaks we got to come together we got to stop them
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:05.000]  and why is this transmission been successful because it's real

[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:35.880]  issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:38.920]  affirmation none you wouldn't want someone calling
[1:26:38.920 --> 1:26:42.920]  and doing 911 reporting you for a crime and
[1:26:42.920 --> 1:26:46.600]  not putting their reputation on the line
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:53.000]  and saying who they were yeah but they don't make people do that and i'm
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:57.560]  against 911 because it trains us to tattle on our neighbors and it's 311
[1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:01.240]  then it's text message the police then it's anonymously are you kidding they

[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:20.360]  and no no i think no no no i mean i mean i think people that accuse
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:23.960]  uh someone of something need to that that that the accused you'll be able to
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:26.440]  face their accuser and you're absolutely right
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:30.680]  my point is the police state can't live on both sides of the fence
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:34.600]  where where they don't you know make you say who you are part of the time at the
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:38.920]  other part of the time they do and they can't jump back and forth and use these
[1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:43.000]  confidential informants who are just a hired crook who'll go lie on anybody in

[1:34:00.360 --> 1:34:04.360]  really getting well alex the pennsylvania
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:08.840]  independent consumers and farmers association was formed after
[1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:13.080]  the first demonstration that a group of us put together down at the mark nalt
[1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:18.760]  farm mark nalt was threatened with jail
[1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:22.600]  because he turned his permit back into the state
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:28.280]  he had had a permit at one time and the permit permits only the sale of milk
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:32.920]  and aged cheese but his customers wanted to fear they wanted to buy cream
[1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:36.680]  they wanted to buy butter so he started making it and selling it in good
[1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:40.360]  conscience he said i cannot have this permit here
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:44.520]  which permits me only to sell milk and cheese
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:47.960]  and then also sell the other products we gave it back to the state
[1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:51.800]  and said i don't need your permit i'm new just fine thank you the state of
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:57.160]  course thought otherwise and they went to the local jp and they
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:00.680]  issued a warrant for his uh the raid to place and the first time they came in
[1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:05.080]  and sold about 25 000 bucks for the stuff wonderful cheese
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:09.720]  kefir equipment etc uh this didn't deter mark he kept
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:12.520]  right on working kept making his good stuff
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:16.920]  uh people kept supporting him and charlie after that first wave we had a
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:19.960]  of a demonstration at his farm reproached that
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:23.560]  demonstration but about three four months later they
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:28.600]  raided him again about 25 000 bucks again that time
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:32.280]  and then not short not very long after a uh
[1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:36.200]  freedom and liberty seminar that the pikfa organization put on
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:40.680]  there's an undercover cop used my name and came into mark nalt's farm and said
[1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:44.040]  uh hey i just moved in the area and i know
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:48.120]  jennison judy that's my wife real well and they suggest this might be a place
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:53.160]  to get uh some raw milk uh the parents weren't there that he was dealing with
[1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:57.480]  the children and of course they weren't maybe as astute as mark would have been
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:00.840]  they stole this undercover cop a stick of gallant milk
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:06.760]  and how dare it not be gmo hormone filled with blood pus and feces
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:10.600]  exactly i mean for those that don't know about dairy operations
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:14.200]  uh i mean i've only worked a little bit in in one
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:18.600]  uh you know the pasteurization process allows
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:22.280]  letting the cow poop get in there the blood the pus
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:25.000]  when you're selling real milk you can't do that
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:29.160]  uh and uh people will get sick of you don't and and and i've seen the
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:32.760]  statistics up until the fifties when they basically banned it
[1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:36.360]  uh for decades they had pasteurized running right up against
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:40.200]  unpasteurized unpasteurized is safer
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:44.200]  than the pasteurized and it's filled with all the enzymes the living nutrients
[1:36:44.200 --> 1:36:49.480]  the antibodies it really is good for you we don't have milk in america anymore
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:55.160]  we have a boiled milk product uh filled with feces please continue
[1:36:55.160 --> 1:37:00.520]  anyway so this uh state drop cop took the milk into the lab
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:03.800]  and they proved of course was raw milk they should another
[1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:10.280]  warrant uh and they came and rated uh mark and his uh family again now
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:14.440]  uh mark has 10 children and they raised a lot they put a lot of stuff
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:19.080]  together in storage for the children but the cops didn't differentiate between
[1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:21.560]  mark's personal stuff and the stuff he had there for
[1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:23.960]  for sale to his friends and neighbors they took it all
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:28.280]  so mark had to start over so now here we have a case where a farmer has lost
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:32.760]  over 65 000 of his stuff and lots of lost time trying to figure out how to work
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:36.520]  it all out and meanwhile we have illegal aliens running rocket attacks
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:39.720]  uh eight thousand dead two thousand on the texas border
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:43.240]  uh police being killed everywhere but don't worry we have undercover cops
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:45.560]  everywhere stopping people selling milk and eggs
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:49.480]  gotta do it it's crazy it's absolutely crazy

[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:07.720]  it's pirates of old so then that's what that's the one in that then the other
[1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:12.360]  instance up in the virgin in vermont is where they came into
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:16.920]  this woman who had this beautiful herd of a flock of milking sheep she imported
[1:39:16.920 --> 1:39:20.840]  did all those were those were al-qaeda operatives those sheep
[1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:27.880]  get right they were al-qaeda operatives straight from ben laudan i'm sure
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:32.200]  on it was just unconscious well i mean what's wrong with killing somebody
[1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:35.000]  sheep that's good that's america that's freedom
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.800]  this is something i mean well hold on hold on tell me more about that story
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:42.600]  well that story the woman wrote a book about it
[1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:46.120]  right now my memory doesn't come out and give you all that i want to get her on
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:49.800]  but i mean this reign of terror we've got a document to continue
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:53.000]  well then you have yet yet you get you may get that woman on at some point
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:56.120]  why did they slaughter the sheep that you said it was a loving thing to do
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:39:59.880]  oh yeah i'm sure they i'm just setting the precedent that they're king yeah
[1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:03.240]  they're right then they took them off the farm
[1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:07.240]  to a separate place and slaughtered them all then you have the case i think you
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:11.160]  had last week of the stars in in ohio where a swat team came in and held the
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:14.840]  family in community cod over eight yards you you heard that nothing and that was
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:21.480]  for that was for selling eggs mm-hmm yeah and it the list goes on in ohio
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:25.960]  rather the trend henry's place uh... in uh...
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:31.960]  pennsylvania talford one of his cut customers got sick from cancer bacteria
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:35.960]  it was not from trend henry's place but they shut him down for a week
[1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:40.680]  and after went back up he lost over probably a hundred thousand dollars so
[1:40:40.680 --> 1:40:45.720]  far then you have the uh... barbara and steve smith case in meadow suite new
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:49.240]  york where the the dairy dropped his permit and
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:52.760]  we're going to form a corporation and they were rated a thousand dollars for
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:57.480]  the product stolen uh... the legal defense fund has uh...
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:01.160]  spent over forty thousand dollars depending on them you have den of stall
[1:41:01.160 --> 1:41:05.560]  scooses in uh... in the libo of florida again rated by tarp part of
[1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:08.600]  agriculture on july seven though seven
[1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:13.160]  or five excuse me uh... stealing the freezer and shut down the farm for five
[1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:16.840]  six months i mean it goes on and on and of course we're back to mark then the
[1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:19.720]  mark mark mark mccathy place in orc ending
[1:41:19.720 --> 1:41:24.200]  pastors in uh... in president california farmers rated

[1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:31.240]  line he forced them off but uh... he's lost over two hundred fifty thousand
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:35.240]  dollars now out of the bigger issue is they have all these secret police that
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:40.040]  go around spying and they see you selling eggs out front your farm and
[1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:44.680]  they'll send another undercover cop to buy eggs as if it's illegal it's not
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:47.880]  and then they swat team you and steal all your computers and material
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:50.440]  but then you've got the amish and the men nights
[1:41:50.440 --> 1:41:53.720]  uh... their cps in their children because they won't vaccinate them

[1:41:57.160 --> 1:42:00.280]  in illinois alone that medical doctors on about that
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:03.880]  uh... i mean they just don't want us free living on the land
[1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:07.960]  and all these little local towns have created all these swat teams and armored
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:11.720]  paramilitary groups and and and the feds are out there all these different

[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:22.040]  are being forced to register the premises this goes against their religious
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:25.720]  freedom and when you register it it's it it then waves all your rights

[1:43:39.240 --> 1:43:42.680]  we gotta we gotta push back look the beast system
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:47.240]  is going to come for them they are not going to unless they stand up and
[1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:52.440]  unified say no to the degenerate america haters the
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:56.680]  literal communists that they hire the greenies who hate anybody look the
[1:43:56.680 --> 1:44:00.280]  greenies don't care about toxic waste genetic engineering
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:04.440]  rainforests being cut down i've seen them all they want is your property
[1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:07.880]  they're pirates okay that's all they are
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:11.080]  and they've got a liberal front with the long hair in the sandals
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:15.480]  but they got machine guns and they want your property they're degenerate
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:21.480]  anti-liberty filth traitorous garbage and we have to admit what they are please
[1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:25.240]  continue so where do we stop where do we start alex
[1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:31.880]  if this this goes on and on uh... one thing we could do perhaps is
[1:44:31.880 --> 1:44:35.720]  make some phone calls uh... to the new
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:39.800]  uh... usda uh... head bill sack i think his name is
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:45.160]  this man is supported and put in place by large corporations
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:48.600]  a very significant part alex of our problem i believe
[1:44:48.600 --> 1:44:52.360]  is the money that's being pushed by a large corporation and their ideas are
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:56.520]  being placed it off on large farmers and they really don't know that are you
[1:44:56.520 --> 1:44:59.880]  kidding the big uh... i mean the big five or six major
[1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:02.760]  gmo companies openly announces their business plan
[1:45:02.760 --> 1:45:05.160]  to shut down all the family farms ranches
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:08.200]  amish and menonites and they're doing a good job of it and they've turned loose
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:12.360]  a bunch of control freak scumbags with submachine guns to do it
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:14.920]  and i'm telling you phone calls isn't going to work with these people they're
[1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:17.720]  just going to promote them if you call and complain about these thugs they're
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:21.480]  going to be promoted they love it they hate this country
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:24.440]  i'm telling you it's going to take a lot more than phone calls and i think it's
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:27.800]  good to put these bastards on notice that we're aware of their criminal
[1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:31.480]  activity but i don't know about phone calls to these degenerates
[1:45:31.480 --> 1:45:34.920]  i'm sorry of the uh... peter out in the midwest
[1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:38.680]  that uh... had his record stolen and all his customers were visited by
[1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:43.000]  thugs from uh... montanto demanding uh... payment for the uh...
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:46.280]  uh... suppose that the infraction is in a montano's right you heard about that
[1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:49.320]  one absolutely percy spicer in canada
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:53.880]  the folks in north dakota i mean people have their seed records they don't buy
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:59.720]  from montanto montanto plants canola or soy beans right next to you
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:02.760]  it gets into your crops that's what that's that's how it works
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:07.080]  they find what they they trespass on your property they find one or two plants
[1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:11.080]  out of a million and then they own their own court
[1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:13.560]  in st louis and they come after you go ahead
[1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:16.520]  it and it goes on it just goes on and on
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:21.400]  it's it's piracy look look it's it's it's it's it's domination it's conquering
[1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:24.680]  these are global corporations their military in operation
[1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:30.280]  we're being conquered by them it's really difficult to know where to start
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:33.160]  alex where i know i don't know what you start with
[1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:38.440]  is that when the consumer realizes what the former is going through
[1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:42.360]  contact your local friendly farmer by direct from the other great big thing
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:46.280]  we have problem with is the state seems to think they own our privilege of
[1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:51.080]  operation i.e in pennsylvania i think we have to have a permit to sell
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:54.600]  food now why they're now saying all over the country without a law it's a
[1:46:54.600 --> 1:46:57.880]  regulation uh... they're trying to texas kansas
[1:46:57.880 --> 1:47:01.080]  missouri all over they're trying to say
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:04.360]  that you don't just buy a hunting license to turn right into a privilege
[1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:08.040]  just like we're back in england again now you've got to register your property
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:11.800]  and waive your rights to be able to hunt on your own land it's not even a law
[1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:16.520]  we have to say no now and and and what you said is key
[1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:20.520]  five five years ago the public woke up that human growth hormone and milk
[1:47:20.520 --> 1:47:25.160]  uh... it was cowharm on but it it mimics human hormone was hurting people
[1:47:25.160 --> 1:47:29.400]  so people started buying organic pasteurized sludge
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:34.200]  it's better than the uh... i mean not uh... the gmo pasteurized sludge
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:37.480]  but they call it milk that white stuff you buy they claims organic
[1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:40.840]  uh... but so now you can't find
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:44.040]  the growth hormone milk now they don't mention all the other hormones they're
[1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:45.080]  putting in it
[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:48.760]  uh... but the point is is that is that we can have a sea change
[1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:53.480]  and i agree you have got to go to farmers markets you have got to support local
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:47:57.560]  farming you have got to go directly to them and not be lazy butts and go to
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:00.360]  only death mart chinese slave mart
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:03.560]  uh... and uh... and uh... buy it go ahead sir
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:07.480]  well if if we go to the local farmer
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:11.480]  and buy from him he thrives there's an instance in
[1:48:11.480 --> 1:48:16.440]  in maryland where a girl said i want to buy raw milk she put together built up
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:20.920]  a buying co-op within two years she had two thousand people buying milk now this
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:24.600]  makes farmers in lancour county thrive it's all illegal
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:28.120]  it's all black market stuff but you know what alex
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:31.800]  it's working well that's like the duke's a hazard and center running moonshine
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:35.880]  they're running milk well listen i'll tell you right now i know people
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:39.080]  that literally go meet in parking lots and it's like a drug deal when they
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:42.040]  sell you the milk i mean that's how pathetic this has gotten
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:45.320]  i've done it i've done it i've delivered i've delivered
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:50.120]  meat to parking lots in maryland from my farm
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:53.000]  it's crazy it looks like it looks like a drug deal it really does it's really
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.480]  crazy alex well i mean have you heard they swat team aloe vera farms now

[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:25.240]  and folks i've studied history so that's why i start hyperventilating and getting
[1:59:25.240 --> 1:59:28.360]  angry because i know all the arguments by the enemy camp i know
[1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:31.480]  all the stuff their brainwashed idiot
[1:59:31.480 --> 1:59:37.000]  servants are told i know that in the name of consumer safety the
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:41.160]  eugenicist in the 20s took over the united states and by the 50s banned in
[1:59:41.160 --> 1:59:44.600]  most states real milk real milk got delivered
[1:59:44.600 --> 1:59:47.480]  everybody's houses uh every once in a while somebody
[1:59:47.480 --> 1:59:51.000]  gets sick from it and that company would be shut down and nobody would buy
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:54.920]  from them again instead you just have a few big conglomerates
[1:59:54.920 --> 1:59:59.960]  that boil and radiate the milk so they can feed you a bunch of poison
[1:59:59.960 --> 2:00:03.000]  and so government regulation has brought us dangerous food
[2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  it has brought us all sorts of problems and the big corporations use all these
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:11.320]  rules to shut down their competition and and as if that isn't bad enough now
[2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:14.680]  with premises and animal id they're shutting down the family farms and
[2:00:14.680 --> 2:00:18.920]  ranches then you won't have a choice see and
[2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:22.200]  they're racing because people are converting over to organic they're
[2:00:22.200 --> 2:00:25.320]  buying with their dollars they're voting with their dollars
[2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:28.520]  and so the establishments in a panic mode right now
[2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:33.320]  so they're really trying to shut down organic uh trade and and and even if
[2:00:33.320 --> 2:00:36.760]  the stuff isn't completely organic uh you know the cleaner foods that are
[2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:40.920]  being grown they don't like these farmers markets they don't like it
[2:00:40.920 --> 2:00:43.960]  and so they are creating hordes of bureaucrats to go after folks

[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:57.800]  rant and rave at you but you know the israelites
[2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:01.640]  3 000 years ago in egypt weren't allowed to grow their own food
[2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:06.040]  without a permit and slaves black slaves couldn't have their own food without
[2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:09.800]  masters saying they could grow it and this is slavery this is fundamentally
[2:02:09.800 --> 2:02:13.160]  the opposite of what this country's about and i don't care what all these slack
[2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:16.600]  jaw control freaks uh... the work for the government say about how they're
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:19.080]  protecting us you're not doing anything you're a pack of crooks
[2:02:19.080 --> 2:02:22.040]  they take everybody's blood at birth i told people that a decade ago now it's
[2:02:22.040 --> 2:02:25.000]  mainstream news for any legal dna database
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:28.520]  feds finally got sued over it so they both shine in executive order i don't
[2:02:28.520 --> 2:02:31.800]  care what that crooks says it's not the law
[2:02:31.800 --> 2:02:34.520]  and uh... you know i'm jumping all around the point is we have a completely
[2:02:34.520 --> 2:02:38.360]  bankrupt government that exists for brokerage firms and foreign banks to
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:41.080]  loot the taxpayers that's all that exists for
[2:02:41.080 --> 2:02:44.680]  uh... it's a big corporations can criminally consolidate just like a
[2:02:44.680 --> 2:02:47.560]  hundred years ago the rockefellers would send a train load
[2:02:47.560 --> 2:02:50.680]  of armed mercenaries to kill a whole town
[2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:54.520]  if they wouldn't move off a gold claim or a coal mine
[2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:58.600]  and it's the same crap and i'm sick of it and i salute you sir give your phone
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:03.560]  number out again okay that's uh... telephone number is seven one seven
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:08.840]  five three six three six one eight and the uh...
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:12.040]  the pickpaw is pickpaw
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:18.600]  um info at pickpaw.org all right thank you so much uh Jonas Stoltzfuss
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:22.280]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[2:03:22.280 --> 2:03:25.080]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:28.680]  we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to
[2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:31.080]  stand in a bread line if you have your own bread
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:34.440]  you'll never have to go to the superdome and beg for female to take care of your
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:37.160]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:40.440]  our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special
[2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:43.000]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.800]  they turned off the telephones and emailed they voted to print
[2:03:45.800 --> 2:03:48.760]  eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:51.560]  this money now owns the american and european banks
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:55.400]  the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:03:59.320]  to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:02.840]  many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation
[2:04:02.840 --> 2:04:06.680]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four
[2:04:06.680 --> 2:04:10.040]  billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast

[2:06:13.880 --> 2:06:17.080]  wide open phones previously we were taking phone calls
[2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:20.760]  from folks about what their predictions for 2009 are
[2:06:20.760 --> 2:06:23.960]  how bad they think the controlled economic implosion by the private
[2:06:23.960 --> 2:06:29.240]  central banks will be their take on the fact that 2008
[2:06:29.240 --> 2:06:32.600]  was the year where hundreds of mainstream news publications from the
[2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:35.880]  financial times of london to the wall street journal admitted
[2:06:35.880 --> 2:06:40.120]  that a secret world government has been built by the private banks and that it
[2:06:40.120 --> 2:06:43.160]  is tyrannical but that that is for our own good
[2:06:43.160 --> 2:06:46.360]  and that they have orchestrated the crisis and will now
[2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:50.040]  have take over the planet control the issuance of currencies
[2:06:50.040 --> 2:06:54.360]  and then we will buy carbon credit taxes from them that has all been announced
[2:06:54.360 --> 2:06:58.520]  in over 200 publications in the last few months that i have seen
[2:06:58.520 --> 2:07:02.520]  just unbelievable arrogance on the establishment's part
[2:07:02.520 --> 2:07:06.840]  also neoconbolton says gaza conflict may result in us attack on iran
[2:07:06.840 --> 2:07:09.560]  we're going to play that clip later in the hour
[2:07:09.560 --> 2:07:12.920]  and some of the other developments the military is now responding to the public
[2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:15.720]  saying don't worry troops are going to be on the streets
[2:07:15.720 --> 2:07:19.000]  but it's for your own good we've got the head of north com
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:22.600]  the military dictatorship over the u.s and the military publicly works for

[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:54.280]  been doing on my mind page page a lot just sending out like a lot of
[2:11:54.280 --> 2:11:58.040]  blogs and stuff and i just wanted to ask you a quick question
[2:11:58.040 --> 2:12:03.160]  um because i i told my mom earlier about the social security like how was it
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:06.520]  scheme and stuff she was like well really how was it because
[2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:09.960]  i know people that got money off social security and let me tell you how it's a
[2:12:09.960 --> 2:12:14.680]  Ponzi scheme i mean is that your question yeah okay i have a video clip i'm
[2:12:14.680 --> 2:12:18.200]  going to play later we have time in the final hour
[2:12:18.200 --> 2:12:22.840]  where uh what jim rogers describes how it's a Ponzi scheme we also have one
[2:12:22.840 --> 2:12:26.600]  max keiser who we've got coming on a couple weeks back on the show
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:30.520]  you know top financial advisor he's the adventurer of of even some of the stock
[2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:34.120]  market systems that they're used to today uh but
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:36.760]  we don't need a financial expert to tell us what a Ponzi scheme is even though
[2:12:36.760 --> 2:12:42.280]  they do in a great fashion uh in a very informative fashion
[2:12:42.280 --> 2:12:48.920]  they take in the new people's money to pay the folks that are supposed to be
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:52.600]  getting their social security that is they the government spins all the
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:57.560]  social security money that comes in on weapons systems on buying fake media
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:02.040]  on their own swiss bank accounts you know they spent the money that people
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:07.560]  that are 70 years old 65 years old put in 20 30 40 years ago
[2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:11.160]  now they spend the money as it comes in the second it comes in
[2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:14.760]  and so they're taking the new people's money
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:18.360]  and they're paying the folks that paid in previously
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:23.080]  that's the definition of a Ponzi scheme that's how a Ponzi scheme works
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:27.800]  uh there isn't an investment paying return to the members of the
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:31.000]  financial instrument it is the new people's money
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:34.920]  that is paying it that is the very definition
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:39.560]  of a Ponzi scheme does that answer your question
[2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:42.920]  yes that definitely and isn't that similar to how banks work though
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:46.440]  yes and exactly why why can the new world order always win
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:52.040]  why do they own the police the military the government the corporations
[2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:54.280]  look i appreciate your call let me comment on this right now because i
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:57.160]  need to move on other callers and and and again you bring up such incredible
[2:13:57.160 --> 2:14:01.320]  points sir god bless you have a great new year okay wilson
[2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:05.160]  yeah thanks a million because it's just i've got to keep myself to time or i'll
[2:14:05.160 --> 2:14:08.680]  never get all the calls um
[2:14:08.680 --> 2:14:12.840]  you hear christ he went into the temple with a whip
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:18.840]  he started beating people he overturned the money changers
[2:14:18.840 --> 2:14:24.680]  now who are the money changers the money changers in every culture's had them
[2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:28.760]  every culture has them the money changers people don't like to carry out a
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:32.040]  big bag of gold or silver when that's the main currency
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:35.960]  and so the wealthy wanted to lock it up in a stronghold
[2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:40.280]  and money changers learned to then put out script or checks
[2:14:40.280 --> 2:14:45.160]  you know saying you know goldsmith uh you know johnson or whatever
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:52.040]  or goldsmith moonblad or whatever you know what goldsmith john dove
[2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:58.600]  and they could then issue checks to people to say oh well you know i don't
[2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:01.400]  want to care about the gold around or silver i can be robbed by the rabble
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:06.600]  in the street uh so i write a i o u or or a script that's
[2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:10.920]  redeemable at the bank at the goldsmith's office generally the
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:15.800]  goldsmiths will also be like pawn pawn shops you know quick loans loan
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:21.160]  sharking usury it was you know primitive banks
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:25.880]  and so the goldsmiths learned that the money changers learned they could loan
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:31.160]  out let's say they had a hundred ounces of gold they could loan out a thousand
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:34.120]  they didn't really have that but they could and then goldsmiths learned they
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:39.320]  could buy things with their own script as long as nobody did a run on the bank
[2:15:39.320 --> 2:15:42.920]  now when folks are doing runs on the banks they learned how to pay off the king
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:46.760]  and the king of the guards or or or the head of the guards
[2:15:46.760 --> 2:15:50.600]  to where uh if the people tried to have a run on the bank
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:55.720]  the police would kill them and then the goldsmiths a lot of times would run a
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:15:59.720]  big Ponzi scheme and end up maybe having no gold or diamonds or jewels in their
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:02.520]  in their vault they'd already shipped that to another country
[2:16:02.520 --> 2:16:06.280]  and then they would loan out thousands and thousands of pieces of script or
[2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:08.680]  paper and then they would leave the country
[2:16:08.680 --> 2:16:12.520]  and then everybody would find out there was no gold
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:16.840]  you understand how that works but see now with fractional reserve banking
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:20.280]  that's what the banks do they get one dollar of your money put in there
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:24.520]  and for that dollar to be created debt was created that's paid to them to
[2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:28.680]  begin with us taxpayer money dollar in debt for every
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:33.160]  dollar created and then they get that very money that you're paying for
[2:16:33.160 --> 2:16:35.720]  to give them
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:43.640]  and then they can loan out 10 20 30 40 times now they do unlimited

[2:22:45.800 --> 2:22:46.680]  air
[2:22:46.680 --> 2:22:51.400]  yes hi alex at this last year my mother and i went down to
[2:22:51.400 --> 2:22:57.160]  searon paul at the rally for the republic and uh i just wanted to talk
[2:22:57.160 --> 2:23:01.080]  about a little bit what that was like to see my city
[2:23:01.080 --> 2:23:05.400]  uh it turned into the kind of police state that we saw
[2:23:05.400 --> 2:23:08.520]  and it really it made us sad in many ways because
[2:23:08.520 --> 2:23:13.880]  we can remember a time when we uh knew our our officers by first name we knew
[2:23:13.880 --> 2:23:16.920]  their families we uh we're in a much different
[2:23:16.920 --> 2:23:20.040]  relationship with them and what we saw there was like a
[2:23:20.040 --> 2:23:24.280]  standing army well they've trained them they've trained them
[2:23:24.280 --> 2:23:27.320]  uh that that's for their own good and then they've hired anarchist
[2:23:27.320 --> 2:23:31.560]  by the way i've gotten so conditioned to this but i didn't even cover it
[2:23:31.560 --> 2:23:37.400]  national greek news admits it was on prisonplanet.com sunday and monday
[2:23:37.400 --> 2:23:40.840]  on info wars dot com curtain him i'll ask you to story about it
[2:23:40.840 --> 2:23:46.120]  we guys pull that up uh just uh type into google i'm gonna put it on screen
[2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:48.920]  the headline was sorry to interrupt this is just important i keep forgetting
[2:23:48.920 --> 2:23:52.360]  about it but meaning to cover it for days the headline i believe
[2:23:52.360 --> 2:23:59.640]  was uh greek police uh caught posing as anarchist
[2:23:59.640 --> 2:24:03.640]  yes and and and but the point is it's on the news
[2:24:03.640 --> 2:24:08.280]  the cops knocking out windows attacking people's cars
[2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:11.480]  to make the the people rebelling look bad and then
[2:24:11.480 --> 2:24:16.040]  kurt was right it turns out that that was clearly staged because you notice
[2:24:16.040 --> 2:24:19.400]  it's not real gasoline it quits burning real fast it's some type of
[2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:22.840]  light alcohol you know the type they use in hollywood that doesn't burn real
[2:24:22.840 --> 2:24:25.320]  hot it's still dangerous you know where they
[2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:28.680]  have the cop throw them all off at the cop and he goes oh
[2:24:28.680 --> 2:24:31.880]  you know for the news cameras it doesn't roll and then suddenly it doesn't
[2:24:31.880 --> 2:24:35.400]  burn his clothes but turns out just like auto a canada
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:40.200]  the this year just like denver denver post police attack police
[2:24:40.200 --> 2:24:46.360]  so they are busting out the windows in the cars the truth is the public is
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:51.480]  attacking government buildings and banks but see the cops then go dress up
[2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:54.120]  like them with clubs there's video on it we'll put up there
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:58.600]  and beat people's cars and knock out windows to get the general public
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:04.040]  against each other now again again i mean how do they get cops from the u.s
[2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:08.120]  to canada to greece to do this they it's it's a criminal
[2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:12.920]  organization i mean i i'm sorry go ahead make a point now i just want to
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:17.640]  bring that up we don't know that's exactly right i mean as i said we were
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:22.280]  sad to see a city we didn't even recognize in the same way
[2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:27.480]  but we we weren't afraid which is a big difference i think for most people when
[2:25:27.480 --> 2:25:31.640]  they realize when they start waking up they realize that they have to go through
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:35.800]  a certain fear factor that it hits them when they realize how
[2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:41.160]  um how out of the loop they've been and and they realize how how frightening it
[2:25:41.160 --> 2:25:45.080]  can be but to go beyond it and to realize that
[2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:48.760]  it's important to to stand up to be there to
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:55.400]  to have a presence to participate and so my mother is 76 i'm 50 we
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:25:58.360]  we we didn't care we were not afraid we walked
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:02.680]  past a lot of these police lines and we were
[2:26:02.680 --> 2:26:08.760]  representing ourselves with our other fellow citizens and it was very inspiring
[2:26:08.760 --> 2:26:12.520]  and so for the new year resolution i hope to encourage everybody
[2:26:12.520 --> 2:26:16.520]  to get involved and to do the right thing the resistance doesn't mean
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:22.040]  it has to be offensive it can be just doing the right thing
[2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:25.000]  absolutely god bless you and go to hear from you
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:28.440]  the reason i got off on that whole jag was i talked to people that were
[2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:31.160]  there reporting for us then i talked to witnesses then it turned out it was on
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:35.320]  the local news you'd have these big burly anarchists you know
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:37.720]  they're big cops because they send the big cops in because you know it's
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:40.600]  dangerous i mean i've literally seen six foot
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:43.880]  seven austin cops dressed up like anarchists trying to start stuff before
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:48.200]  and i'm like come on you're a cop knock it off man what a criminal action
[2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:51.240]  you know a real anarchist is like five foot three
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:57.400]  on methamphetamine and then you know they just get provocative by the feds
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:01.080]  uh not all the anarchists but the point is most of them the point here is
[2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:03.960]  is that they'd have cops run out from behind the lines
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:07.080]  knock windows out tump stuff over and the news would say
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:10.920]  look at the anarchists now the police have to attack all the peaceful crowds
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:14.600]  i mean this is provocateur baloney stay with us we'll be

[2:29:47.800 --> 2:29:51.960]  in other words ozone do many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with
[2:29:51.960 --> 2:29:56.280]  ozone before and after operations and have you ever heard of ozone therapy
[2:29:56.280 --> 2:29:59.800]  ionic zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy
[2:29:59.800 --> 2:30:04.040]  ozone therapy is used among other things to raise the body's oxygen level
[2:30:04.040 --> 2:30:07.720]  which study suggests boosts the immune system you can learn more about
[2:30:07.720 --> 2:30:12.360]  ozone therapy or ionic zone ozone generators by going to ionic zone

[2:30:22.440 --> 2:30:27.080]  ninety five thirty five ionic zone
[2:30:35.640 --> 2:30:40.840]  throughout history powerful ruthless cunning individuals seek to dominate
[2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:44.280]  populations they love death they love destruction
[2:30:44.280 --> 2:30:47.880]  they love attacking the innocent
[2:30:47.960 --> 2:30:51.880]  well the greatest manifestation of this dehumanizing evil
[2:30:51.880 --> 2:30:56.040]  is now upon us it is called the new world order
[2:30:56.040 --> 2:31:00.040]  because everything the enemy does is a deception it is truly the old world
[2:31:00.040 --> 2:31:04.680]  order tyranny but the enemy wishes you to believe
[2:31:04.680 --> 2:31:08.520]  that they are something new when they are as old
[2:31:08.520 --> 2:31:14.200]  as the bones of the great old lizard the old dragon the old serpent
[2:31:14.200 --> 2:31:19.160]  beelzebob make no mistake ladies and gentlemen
[2:31:19.160 --> 2:31:24.840]  you are in the fight of your life i am in the fight of my life
[2:31:24.840 --> 2:31:29.160]  and we are together if you haven't chosen sides
[2:31:29.160 --> 2:31:35.240]  that's why you don't feel empowered it's why you
[2:31:35.240 --> 2:31:39.000]  feel so anxious it's why you feel like you're missing something in your life
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:44.440]  if you join evil you will be fulfilled because you will now have chosen your
[2:31:44.440 --> 2:31:47.720]  destiny but if you choose goodness you will be
[2:31:47.720 --> 2:31:51.400]  fulfilled in a way that evil will never fulfill you
[2:31:51.400 --> 2:31:56.200]  but i tell you now those of you that are lukewarm you are the worst
[2:31:56.200 --> 2:32:02.360]  because uh you are neither and it is a pathetic state to be in i disrespect
[2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:06.520]  you those of you that make excuses that don't admit what you're part of
[2:32:06.520 --> 2:32:10.600]  if you're going to be evil you might as well go for the gold
[2:32:10.600 --> 2:32:16.360]  go for the prize plumb the depths and if you're going to be good
[2:32:16.360 --> 2:32:20.680]  you should throw all caution to the wind and commit yourself to be a good person
[2:32:20.680 --> 2:32:24.600]  and to lead and to guide and direct and to help people
[2:32:24.600 --> 2:32:29.400]  and to ask god to lead guide and direct you all right uh look it's totally jam
[2:32:29.400 --> 2:32:32.600]  packed i want to get into the body snatchers as an analogy to what it's
[2:32:32.600 --> 2:32:37.240]  like to live in a society with these people under government mind control
[2:32:37.240 --> 2:32:41.320]  i want to get into a ton of news and yes i said i'm taking a lot of calls today
[2:32:41.320 --> 2:32:44.440]  mike kin mark david justin and others are going to you
[2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:48.200]  here in just a moment uh but i wanted to direct you to a story we're going to
[2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:52.600]  cover first national guard soldiers to usher in the new year
[2:32:52.600 --> 2:32:57.000]  at times square so we're going to be going over
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:00.200]  this report right after i tell you about a couple of our sponsors yes
[2:33:00.200 --> 2:33:04.280]  i have done an hour two hours two hours and 35
[2:33:04.280 --> 2:33:07.800]  minutes of broadcast today and i've not plugged any of our sponsors including
[2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:10.680]  my books and videos
[2:33:10.680 --> 2:33:13.960]  and that's how we fund this operation i mean this isn't cheap we got
[2:33:13.960 --> 2:33:17.480]  two guys a third guy in their training to run the tv show and things we're
[2:33:17.480 --> 2:33:21.080]  doing this on the cheap's you know we're uh got this
[2:33:21.080 --> 2:33:24.360]  office filmmaking the websites the servers
[2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:28.920]  info wars dot com is rated 2000 places above rush limbaugh dot com
[2:33:28.920 --> 2:33:32.920]  present planet dot com you know is rated above some of the biggest websites
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:36.120]  out there it's expensive just to pay for the bandwidth for these babies
[2:33:36.120 --> 2:33:39.640]  and we need your support but that's not even the reason that's an added caveat
[2:33:39.640 --> 2:33:42.680]  that when you buy books and videos from the secure online video and bookstore at
[2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:49.400]  info wars dot com you support everything we're doing here
[2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:53.320]  that's a side issue though you get material that's informative dynamic
[2:33:53.320 --> 2:33:56.920]  now this is award-winning this is one of all these top awards in europe in the
[2:33:56.920 --> 2:34:00.280]  u.s this is like you know better than some discovery channel show
[2:34:00.280 --> 2:34:05.240]  the top director out of france made it but it's it's it's in english
[2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:08.520]  the world according to monsanto we just got these in
[2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:14.920]  and uh there's a bonus film on rbgh growth hormone and milk
[2:34:14.920 --> 2:34:19.800]  plus a free audio cd with the two-hour film from age norms to genetically
[2:34:19.800 --> 2:34:23.800]  modified crops a biotech giant with your best interest at heart
[2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:27.400]  and uh here you know i'm sure you know this stuff's bad and you've seen the
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:29.960]  documents your neighbors aren't going to read documents they're not going to
[2:34:29.960 --> 2:34:33.560]  listen to the show with all the facts you give them a fancy looking video like
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:36.600]  this packaging is everything and boy let me tell you the cover
[2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:40.360]  matches the info and you give this to somebody it's available for 1995 at
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:44.440]  info wars dot com it's two films and an audio cd
[2:34:44.440 --> 2:34:49.880]  1995 info wars dot com uh go buy 10 of these suckers give them to people
[2:34:49.880 --> 2:34:53.160]  i didn't make this film so i can't tell you make copies of it my films i want
[2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:58.840]  you to get in game terror storm uh fabled enemies truth rising and i want
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:01.320]  you to make copies that's what's going to bring into their knees
[2:35:01.320 --> 2:35:04.760]  so the world according to monsanto the newest item at info wars dot com you
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:09.320]  can also call toll free to order at 888-253-3139
[2:35:09.320 --> 2:35:14.920]  triple 8253-3139 here's our latest film i produced jason bermas made it
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:17.800]  a pretty controversial 911 film for us to make
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:21.560]  and uh seven years after 911 this supposed mastermind behind the attacks
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:25.400]  is still at large and the nation is
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:29.640]  entrenched in multiple wars in the middle east has been lauding the evil
[2:35:29.640 --> 2:35:33.000]  behind the attack or a mere frontman in a larger picture
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:36.440]  a boogeyman we were told we were fighting a war on terror and that the
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:39.560]  terrorist hate us for our freedom if that is the case
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:43.240]  why do our leaders take more and more of our freedoms away and uh barry jennings
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:45.880]  the deputy head of emergency management who blew the whistle on the film
[2:35:45.880 --> 2:35:52.040]  he died so he's dead uh michael j springman visa department head who said
[2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:55.080]  that they were cia agents mohammed addon everybody
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:36:02.360]  bo dedle former nypd detective uh sythia mckinney micro vero joe biden
[2:36:02.360 --> 2:36:06.840]  i mean that you know this film needs to be seen uh the money masters
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:10.120]  three and a half hour film you want to you want to have a master's degree in
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:13.640]  the private banks the new world order here it is ladies and gentlemen
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:17.640]  the money masters how the banks create the world's money how they rule us i see
[2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:21.320]  in the near future crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me trouble
[2:36:21.320 --> 2:36:24.520]  for the safety of my country corporations have been enthroned
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:28.120]  and an era of corruption will follow and the money power of the country will
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:32.040]  endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people
[2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:35.160]  until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:38.440]  and the republic destroyed ebraham lincoln
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:42.440]  andrew jackson if congress has the right under the constitution issue paper
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:46.520]  money it has given them to use themselves not to
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:50.120]  be delegated to individuals or corporations another one from thomas
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:53.400]  deverson of the people ever allow private banks to control the
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:57.160]  issuance of their currency first by inflation and by deflation the banks
[2:36:57.160 --> 2:37:00.520]  that will uh deprive the people of all property until
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:04.200]  their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered
[2:37:04.200 --> 2:37:08.120]  the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people
[2:37:08.120 --> 2:37:12.760]  to whom it belongs thomas jefferson 1995 it's like 30 bucks everywhere else
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:18.200]  folks this is a three and a half hour film on two dvds
[2:37:18.200 --> 2:37:23.400]  uh and then we've got mart dice's resistance manifesto the new edition
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:27.560]  the rise of the fourth right the nazi system in control of the west
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:32.920]  just amazing film not nazi's the fascist system
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:36.520]  and then oh we have my journal you can't sell that
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:40.360]  this is just my little ideas and things like a little tweedy bird on it
[2:37:40.360 --> 2:37:44.040]  kind of like salacious chrome over there all right anyways folks okay that's
[2:37:44.040 --> 2:37:48.680]  it i'm done plugging the books the videos we do need your support
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:51.880]  uh the economy is falling apart as you know i won't lie to you
[2:37:51.880 --> 2:37:55.480]  uh this is the way we wake people up and get the word out and
[2:37:55.480 --> 2:37:58.600]  our video sells were down by 50 percent now they're down by 70 percent
[2:37:58.600 --> 2:38:01.880]  i'm sure your business is doing the same too everything is falling apart ladies
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:05.480]  and gentlemen that's why we are as things get worse
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:09.640]  we're expanding we're moving forward we're we're we're putting out our
[2:38:09.640 --> 2:38:13.000]  maximum effort to fight the new world order and we need your
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:17.160]  your financial support to do it so please fuel our little f-16s in the info
[2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:21.160]  war so we can drop info bombs on the enemy and unlock minds
[2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:25.880]  all right uh you know what let's go to mike kin
[2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:28.760]  mark david justin and then i'm going to get into all this military news
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:34.360]  and uh the the us ambassador to the un saying that the the this is
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:39.000]  israeli situation may be a prelude to an attack on iran very serious
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:43.320]  uh but let's well we have each caller a minute mike in new york you're on the
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:46.280]  air go ahead hello alex how are you good sir
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:49.320]  um i heard you talking earlier today in your broadcast about uh
[2:38:49.320 --> 2:38:53.800]  ecoli and ecoli byproducts um a biochemist and i work for ortho
[2:38:53.800 --> 2:38:58.040]  clinical diagnostics and i i've worked with hb 101
[2:38:58.040 --> 2:39:01.240]  which is a non pathogenic form of ecoli
[2:39:01.240 --> 2:39:05.400]  uh there's many variants of ecoli uh there's probably hundreds
[2:39:05.400 --> 2:39:08.680]  you can't be sure of everything that's out there because there's bio i thought
[2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:11.960]  there were thousands of ecoli yeah oh sure i mean there's people working with
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:15.880]  them transfecting genes constantly with them so we can change you know it's
[2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:19.560]  at a lightning speed yeah they get more mutations to find what they're looking
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:22.280]  for right i used to produce a fluorescent green
[2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:25.720]  protein with them uh the neat thing about hb 101 is they're like a blank
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:28.840]  slate you transfect genes into them and they'll make whatever you tell them to
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:32.280]  make uh we make human insulin with them which was a remarkable
[2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:35.560]  breakthrough because we have to rely on pig insulin for people who are
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:39.240]  diabetic now we have huge you know 30 000 pound vats of
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:43.720]  ecoli who are just pumping out and producing um insulin for uh people i
[2:39:43.720 --> 2:39:47.000]  know but i don't i mean my point is i tell the audience that aspartame
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:50.840]  is basically produced by ecoli and they tell me i'm a liar i mean you know right
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:54.200]  and and that's why i'm calling because uh it's absolutely true that's what's
[2:39:54.200 --> 2:39:58.440]  going on and what's really fearful as well are they making with it um
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:02.280]  you know we've we've transfected genes human genes retroviruses
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:06.520]  um and and the list goes on and on i spoke with a dr bower over at the u of r
[2:40:06.520 --> 2:40:09.560]  um university rochester with a program that they have over there where they're
[2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:13.720]  packaging viruses um this this is in you know this has become a cottage
[2:40:13.720 --> 2:40:16.360]  industry for them um they ship these things out
[2:40:16.360 --> 2:40:19.720]  uh and i'm sure it's proprietary type of technology and they're taking the
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:23.240]  genetics they breed in the bacteria and injecting it into another
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:26.920]  live form and then into another live form and it's in our food and then i
[2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:30.040]  talked to top scientists but you work and they're telling me that's correct
[2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:35.160]  that that then it's randomly mutating once it's put in another organism
[2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:38.840]  and they have no idea and this is just going on everywhere and
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:42.200]  this this is the most scary thing about biology um
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:47.240]  and that you know i don't fear nuclear uh affects nuclear war as much as uh
[2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:51.080]  or chemical warfare as i do biological warfare because once the gene is out of
[2:40:51.080 --> 2:40:53.960]  the bottle it's out of control it's in nature's hands
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:57.320]  you can't predict what it will do what will happen in the future it could be
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:00.760]  the most horrific things that nobody digs the consequences that nobody ever
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:03.560]  expected and this is the problem with um a lot of
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:07.080]  what's going on with the government's experimentation in this the militaries
[2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:10.200]  the government and militaries motives cannot be trusted um i remember the
[2:41:10.200 --> 2:41:13.400]  spider goat work up at plasberg military facility in new york state which is in
[2:41:13.400 --> 2:41:16.040]  far from me i interviewed the director of that
[2:41:16.040 --> 2:41:19.480]  yeah i have a colleague who worked at the spider thread protein project 15 years
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:23.400]  ago at the u of r um they could never get the uh protein right so someone came up
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:26.840]  with a bright idea and it was genius to transfect a spider the spider's gene
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:29.640]  to make the protein into a larger domesticated animal and they chose
[2:41:29.640 --> 2:41:32.200]  goats to do so because it's easier to extract the milk
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:36.040]  the protein out of the milk um all these things are very easily done there
[2:41:36.040 --> 2:41:39.640]  there are biochemical companies out there that have cell genes
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:43.640]  slicing and splicing agents slicing is cutting bonds are cutting cell walls and
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:47.160]  so on of the bio the biochemical world and this is a huge part of the industry
[2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:50.600]  and very common um it's it's actually can be a very good thing and there's
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:53.160]  nothing wrong with it for say but uh but when you get
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:56.600]  into the abuses of this technology the consequences are monstrous and that's
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:41:59.400]  the really very fearful thing and everything has to be monitored very
[2:41:59.400 --> 2:42:03.000]  closely um what are people doing with it what are they trying to do and now
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:08.440]  they're building 36 level 4 bio weapons labs moving them from plum island
[2:42:08.440 --> 2:42:11.880]  kansas you know moving them from uh you know
[2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:15.400]  the desert in area 51 to to san antonio texas
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:18.680]  and then who released the weaponized foot and mouth in 2000
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:22.040]  the government used to shut down the farms and ranches they admit the
[2:42:22.040 --> 2:42:26.040]  government released it but it was an accident right and uh you know the
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:29.880]  stuff we know i mean i'll see a blurb in the washington post about
[2:42:29.880 --> 2:42:33.720]  human genes and chimpanzees in argentina
[2:42:33.720 --> 2:42:37.320]  but then uh and then you tell the public that and they don't believe you
[2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:41.880]  or human animal hybrids they already have and you tell the public and imagine
[2:42:41.880 --> 2:42:46.040]  if they're admitting all that what is it we don't know about in black ops
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:49.880]  well they're not telling you i get emails um quite often in the last year or so
[2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:53.560]  from uh the department of defense uh looking for people to work in their
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:56.840]  military projects have you heard the story about my dad that you know the
[2:42:56.840 --> 2:43:00.280]  dentist oral surgeon when i was in like in the in the mid eighties
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:03.960]  they tried to hire him and a bunch of other dentists and then it was a huge
[2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:08.200]  industrial underground underground secret operation double the money was he
[2:43:08.200 --> 2:43:12.440]  said no but but exactly and see they contacted you i mean how big are these
[2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:15.800]  projects yeah there's there's so much going on that they said they would wave
[2:43:15.800 --> 2:43:18.600]  all the restrictions for military you know enrollment
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:22.120]  um your age everything else uh they they they want a lot of people they're
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:25.320]  looking for a lot of people to work on these projects and what scares me a
[2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:28.040]  little bit about the projects are that's like working for the mob it's being
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:31.400]  married to the mob you don't retire from these projects they retire you from
[2:43:31.400 --> 2:43:36.360]  now they've got the human genome project and the national geographic front
[2:43:36.360 --> 2:43:40.520]  to get everybody's uh roots and they've been taking blood for 35 years from
[2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:43.720]  everybody born that's now admitted in a secret dna database
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:47.480]  they've got race specific bio weapons for individuals and i've been told been
[2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:52.200]  top by top sources they've got these gene splicing factories
[2:43:52.200 --> 2:43:56.360]  where if they have their dna uh they now have entire factories that can
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:43:59.800]  engineer a bio weapon just for you individually
[2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:04.280]  right yeah they have tailored tailored systems tell folks about that
[2:44:04.280 --> 2:44:08.200]  well the even even age is very specific like that age was probably one of
[2:44:08.200 --> 2:44:11.000]  the first project stuff 30 years ago where
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:16.520]  um it is more prone to non-caucasians um you know there there's different types
[2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:20.040]  of our antibody systems they're a little bit different from isn't it the
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:24.200]  coupler the the uh yeah i think it's coupler 19
[2:44:24.200 --> 2:44:28.200]  and uh it um you know it becomes somewhat race specific
[2:44:28.200 --> 2:44:31.880]  and and if they've advanced you know why i mean i would be very from an
[2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:36.040]  academic perspective very interested to see how far they've come with this
[2:44:36.040 --> 2:44:39.800]  um i went back i went back to get reeducated
[2:44:39.800 --> 2:44:44.200]  uh in the biochemical field three years ago go back and then finish up uh
[2:44:44.200 --> 2:44:49.880]  with uh my masters and uh it amazed me at how far that this industry and
[2:44:49.880 --> 2:44:53.400]  this technology has come in uh the last 10 15 years
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:57.080]  and this is what we're teaching at the university level what's going on in
[2:44:57.080 --> 2:45:00.600]  in other laboratories yeah to explain what's being taught at the university
[2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:04.440]  level is generally five years behind the most advanced stuff
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:08.280]  usually well i mean i remember seeing 10 years ago 11 years ago
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:12.120]  glowing monkeys in hong kong you know just like in blade bladerunner
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:14.840]  where you know he's going around buying you know genetically engineered snakes
[2:45:14.840 --> 2:45:20.600]  or whatever or cockatoos or owls where and i mean and and this was like in the
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:24.520]  bbc in the washington post and and then i remember seeing videos of glowing
[2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:28.200]  monkeys in the dark you know they've got massive jellyfish
[2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:32.280]  genes in them right and then i cover it on air and listeners call me a liar i
[2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:36.120]  mean it it's just denial that technology is almost that specific
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:39.560]  technology is almost i gotta say 15 to 20 years old
[2:45:39.560 --> 2:45:42.840]  um we use that for right now in
[2:45:42.840 --> 2:45:47.880]  in good scenarios we use it in tracing a movement of fluids and minerals through
[2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:51.880]  plant life and uh through even perhaps animal life
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:55.240]  yeah instead of injecting uh radioactive dyes
[2:45:55.240 --> 2:45:58.840]  yeah we can use them as a visual indicator um out in cornell here in
[2:45:58.840 --> 2:46:01.480]  new york state that they use that quite extensively
[2:46:01.480 --> 2:46:05.880]  it's it's less evasive in in the field and uh you mean you can put it on the
[2:46:05.880 --> 2:46:08.840]  ground plant life will absorb it and it's not
[2:46:08.840 --> 2:46:12.280]  hazardous like using radioactive hey what do you think the chemtrails are what
[2:46:12.280 --> 2:46:15.640]  do you think they're spraying uh boy i don't know and i you know i'm
[2:46:15.640 --> 2:46:18.840]  real fearful of that because again here we go with polluting the environment
[2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:21.880]  and it's something that you almost can't escape because it gets in the air the
[2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:27.400]  water well i mean here's the big problem you're a scientist in
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:30.680]  we know the globalist or psychopathic that everything compartmentalizes was
[2:46:30.680 --> 2:46:34.040]  all set up to carry out eugenics we know the rocket fellers in the 30s
[2:46:34.040 --> 2:46:38.120]  isolated that most cancer was viral we know that their weaponized cancer
[2:46:38.120 --> 2:46:41.320]  programs what created the hiv that's declassified
[2:46:41.320 --> 2:46:43.960]  and they are sworn to kill us and i'm telling you
[2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:46.200]  they're going to get their police state in place
[2:46:46.200 --> 2:46:49.240]  they're going to get us you know uh under their control and they're going to
[2:46:49.240 --> 2:46:52.600]  kill everybody and i want the cops and people listening you think you're
[2:46:52.600 --> 2:46:55.000]  going to win you think it's going to be fun rolling america
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:59.320]  you know taking us down you got the power ha you have no idea who you're
[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:02.600]  working for and no idea what's happening to all of you
[2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:07.080]  well all of you about like with your previous guest about uh you know
[2:47:07.080 --> 2:47:11.240]  purchasing food directly from farmers um that hasn't been tampered with
[2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:15.320]  hasn't been irradiated hasn't been pasteurized i grew up with non-pasteurized
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:19.960]  milk um i grew up on a semi farm we raised our own cattle
[2:47:19.960 --> 2:47:24.360]  pigs we made our own food we made everything from our own mustard
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:28.440]  um and things like this i made maple syrup and we just lived off the land
[2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:31.000]  and that's what people really need to realize is just about everything you
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:34.120]  buy the grocery store has been tampered with altered i can't believe the
[2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:37.960]  garbage when you read the label um how many chemicals are in just
[2:47:37.960 --> 2:47:41.320]  fruit juice or something that you buy off but you know they have all these
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:43.400]  byproducts leftover from the oil industry
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:46.760]  they gotta put them somewhere so instead of being a holy
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:50.760]  yeah we have all the sodium fluoride to crack the um the oil
[2:47:50.760 --> 2:47:54.520]  yeah it's just amazing that you find that in food or even just you know they
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:57.080]  shouldn't say food or consumer products because when you read a label it tells
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:48:00.200]  you it's poison not to swallow it hey you know i'd like to have you on as a
[2:48:00.200 --> 2:48:02.600]  guest uh i don't know if you want to go public with your name
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:05.800]  or or recommend any other doctors or scientists you think we ought to
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:08.600]  interview because uh all your info you're saying checks out i'd love to have you
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:12.280]  on as a guest you're really a well-spoken fellow i will will you uh

[2:51:30.040 --> 2:51:33.720]  yeah i hope that microbiologist will send me his email and we'll have him on
[2:51:33.720 --> 2:51:37.320]  you know we've had a lot of top microbiologists on
[2:51:37.320 --> 2:51:41.000]  dealing with it and like that news clip of play yesterday
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:47.640]  they don't want most of the public knowing what they're doing
[2:51:47.640 --> 2:51:51.560]  and the problem is dr eric pionka is a biologist and he's got a bunch of
[2:51:51.560 --> 2:51:54.040]  microbiologists that graduated off of under him
[2:51:54.040 --> 2:51:58.120]  that sent me threatening emails with links to their
[2:51:58.120 --> 2:52:03.080]  their graduate papers where they said they want to kill everybody
[2:52:03.080 --> 2:52:07.240]  and then you google them and and and you see them in white lab coats and they're
[2:52:07.240 --> 2:52:10.920]  working at bio weapons labs i mean we got people saying they want to kill us
[2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:14.440]  working at bio weapons labs they don't want to kill the ruskies they don't want
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:17.160]  to kill the chikoms they don't want to kill the Arabs i know a lot of you good
[2:52:17.160 --> 2:52:21.240]  old boys you know have been dehumanized and
[2:52:21.240 --> 2:52:24.520]  you know you didn't know when you do dehumanize somebody else you get
[2:52:24.520 --> 2:52:28.360]  dehumanized oh yeah this is for you and they're going to kill you they're going
[2:52:28.360 --> 2:52:30.120]  to kill you they're going to kill your family
[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:33.400]  and that's why nothing really matters to me anymore other than saving people
[2:52:33.400 --> 2:52:36.040]  the species matters i'm not worried about being killed
[2:52:36.040 --> 2:52:40.120]  i'm not worried about being arrested or set up or taken to prison
[2:52:40.120 --> 2:52:43.720]  i only keep my nose clean and everything i do so they don't have an excuse to come
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:46.920]  after me and so they do come after me it'll be a total setup
[2:52:46.920 --> 2:52:51.320]  and i'm ready i am honored i mean if i knew it would save a million people
[2:52:51.320 --> 2:52:54.760]  right now folks i jump into a meat grinder wouldn't think five seconds
[2:52:54.760 --> 2:52:57.560]  save a million children jump in that meat grinder boom i kill myself just like
[2:52:57.560 --> 2:53:00.440]  that okay and i wouldn't call it killing
[2:53:00.440 --> 2:53:02.680]  myself i mean to stop those children being hurt
[2:53:02.680 --> 2:53:07.000]  i will not be part of this crap and i want that to be clear
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:11.640]  right now ladies and gentlemen i am i i understand that the species is what's
[2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:16.680]  important my only fear is now for the species
[2:53:16.680 --> 2:53:21.080]  god almighty folks you just cannot imagine how evil the forces are we're
[2:53:21.080 --> 2:53:24.520]  dealing with here they love destroying life they love
[2:53:24.520 --> 2:53:27.800]  destroying and wrecking everything that's good
[2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:30.440]  and none of the real environmental issues are being addressed ladies and
[2:53:30.440 --> 2:53:33.880]  gentlemen they got corn and wheat and stuff growing that's got every type of
[2:53:33.880 --> 2:53:37.480]  genetic engineered organism in it it's spreading all over all sorts of
[2:53:37.480 --> 2:53:40.680]  illnesses and sicknesses i mean we're screwed folks i mean it's
[2:53:40.680 --> 2:53:44.120]  already devastation the earth is already
[2:53:44.120 --> 2:53:48.200]  devastated by what they've done and we don't even imagine what they're doing
[2:53:48.200 --> 2:53:50.920]  we don't know about
[2:53:52.520 --> 2:53:57.160]  yeah now i'm not seeing i'm too worried about my hair falling out anymore
[2:53:57.160 --> 2:54:00.360]  now i'm not too worried about what people think of me i watch these yuppies
[2:54:00.360 --> 2:54:02.680]  walk into restaurants or something they're all real insecure so they act
[2:54:02.680 --> 2:54:05.640]  real tough and cool or the general public you see
[2:54:05.640 --> 2:54:07.960]  poor folks that feel real insecure about themselves
[2:54:07.960 --> 2:54:11.400]  when they come in places you know who cares man we're on a giant
[2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:15.480]  rock planetoid with a tiny thin atmosphere hurtling through space
[2:54:15.480 --> 2:54:20.600]  with psycho scientists running the planet bringing in tyranny
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:24.520]  it's i'm like the guy at the end of the body snatchers going you're in danger
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:27.880]  we've got a fight of people going shut up crazy man
[2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:32.520]  i swear it's deadly i've interviewed all the top scientists it's killing you
[2:54:32.520 --> 2:54:36.120]  it's hurting you know shut up i love gmo
[2:54:36.120 --> 2:54:39.720]  you know and i'm like no please let their psychos their own documents look
[2:54:39.720 --> 2:54:43.960]  oh i bet there's documents
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:50.680]  and i i can't believe i'm the cutting edge the front
[2:54:50.680 --> 2:54:53.880]  the tip of the spear i don't have some big giant image of myself
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:58.120]  i'm just a normal person who read history studied history happened to run
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:55:00.520]  into history i read history because it was entertaining
[2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:05.720]  it was interesting you know my mom was a history major so when i was growing up
[2:55:05.720 --> 2:55:10.520]  i cracked a history book at every page was jam packed
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:15.160]  with action packed info and this wasn't fiction this was real
[2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:18.040]  so i learned how government worked and then i went to college and they lied and
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:21.400]  said that wasn't how it worked and and told me world government was good and
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:24.120]  then i'd see CNN telling me world government didn't exist at night
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:28.360]  that at school they tell me world government was good
[2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:32.120]  and then i found out who the world government is that they want to kill us
[2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:35.880]  and they constantly talk about it and then i learned
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:39.720]  top scientists give speeches where they say they want to kill 90 percent of us
[2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:43.480]  at least and they get standing ovations with the scientists crying
[2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:47.640]  this is a cult ladies and gentlemen oh yes kill everyone oh it's so
[2:55:47.640 --> 2:55:52.280]  oh oh god and then i criticize them so i get
[2:55:52.280 --> 2:55:55.960]  their graduate students going here's my paper on humans being a parasite
[2:55:55.960 --> 2:56:00.440]  i can't wait till we're all dead by the way i work in a bio weapons laboratory
[2:56:00.440 --> 2:56:07.080]  i mean can you understand what we're facing

[2:58:26.280 --> 2:58:31.480]  hello alex jones uh i got a couple comments before i make my 2009
[2:58:31.480 --> 2:58:35.640]  prediction if that's all right yes sir watching you here on
[2:58:35.640 --> 2:58:40.440]  prisonplanet.tv the difference in prisonplanet.tv and
[2:58:40.440 --> 2:58:44.760]  listen on the radio is night and day i'm telling you alex is
[2:58:44.760 --> 2:58:49.640]  entertaining as hell and uh y'all won't believe it but he has a
[2:58:49.640 --> 2:58:56.920]  fantastic smile and the other point is uh i am so grateful for
[2:58:56.920 --> 2:59:01.240]  this program i've gotten so much information i really appreciate it
[2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:04.520]  but most importantly i appreciate the listeners
[2:59:04.520 --> 2:59:08.600]  because the listeners is what's changing this country
[2:59:08.600 --> 2:59:12.920]  and the world now my prediction is i believe this year that
[2:59:12.920 --> 2:59:18.120]  that we the people are literally going to change this country and the world they
[2:59:18.120 --> 2:59:23.080]  say it only takes five percent and i heard on gcn ready i don't know
[2:59:23.080 --> 2:59:26.200]  whether it's alex jones show or some other show
[2:59:26.200 --> 2:59:29.640]  that there's over one billion people in the world
[2:59:29.640 --> 2:59:34.440]  are aware of what's going on and who's been causing all these problems and one
[2:59:34.440 --> 2:59:37.240]  billion is twenty percent of the population
[2:59:37.240 --> 2:59:41.160]  the problem is they're isolated and they feel like they're alone
[2:59:41.160 --> 2:59:45.960]  the final illusion that has to fall is that we're not the majority that we are
[2:59:45.960 --> 2:59:49.080]  the majority you know it's like 92 percent in every major poll it's
[2:59:49.080 --> 2:59:53.320]  90 95 but i think 92 is the average knowing the government killed jfk
[2:59:53.320 --> 2:59:56.440]  that eight percent sits up there and tells us we're a bunch of kooks
[2:59:56.440 --> 3:00:00.360]  i don't care what they say on their high horses or how many fake tv programs they
[3:00:00.360 --> 3:00:03.960]  make with baloney evidence the evidence is out we know
[3:00:03.960 --> 3:00:07.320]  and i don't care if the news says i'm a liar and there's not spider goats or
[3:00:07.320 --> 3:00:11.000]  genetic engineering or that it didn't kill in the rats they feed it to i'm
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:13.400]  going to keep telling the truth and we're going to keep showing their pack of
[3:00:13.400 --> 3:00:16.040]  liars and they're trying to shut the web down right now
[3:00:16.040 --> 3:00:18.840]  but i'm telling you it's too little too late
[3:00:18.840 --> 3:00:22.920]  well i have a few more things if it's all right go ahead
[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:29.160]  uh i found out and i'm sure everyone else knows i'm not the genius here
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:33.960]  but i found out the number one problem is we the people are me
[3:00:33.960 --> 3:00:39.240]  kin because uh and i think other people are waking i'm
[3:00:39.240 --> 3:00:43.000]  sorry we're waking up to the fact that we're the problem because all these
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:47.400]  problems and they're infinite is a reflection of ourselves and we're
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:50.680]  waking up to that fact and now that we are
[3:00:50.680 --> 3:00:55.000]  we're going to do something about it and the moment we start talking to each
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:01:00.120]  other about solutions this country and the world will change
[3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:04.520]  literally not literally but uh figuratively speaking overnight
[3:01:04.520 --> 3:01:09.560]  oh yeah they know we want that this year is the change coming on
[3:01:09.560 --> 3:01:13.400]  no they know we want full of fear constantly because they don't want us
[3:01:13.400 --> 3:01:17.160]  to know and they're terrified like david ike said
[3:01:17.160 --> 3:01:21.080]  but they're terrified of us because let me assure you
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:24.360]  and everyone knows this i'm not mystery expert
[3:01:24.360 --> 3:01:28.920]  we the people made this country great not that handful of rich
[3:01:28.920 --> 3:01:34.920]  elite absolutely hey that's all i have to say and i thank you alex
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:38.600]  hey good to hear from you i really appreciate that call kin
[3:01:38.600 --> 3:01:43.480]  no i totally agree with kin and we all hang together we all hang separate in
[3:01:43.480 --> 3:01:47.640]  fact i wrote a bunch of notes last night you know i get reflective late at night
[3:01:47.640 --> 3:01:50.360]  i'm not really ever been a morning person but i get up at like six thirty
[3:01:50.360 --> 3:01:54.280]  seven in the morning and then i always kind of wake up by five six at night
[3:01:54.280 --> 3:01:57.640]  i'm going to buy an audio recorder david don't we have that one i bought
[3:01:57.640 --> 3:02:01.080]  to do interviews we never use it's kind of big
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:05.000]  i want to start having that at home at night because that's when i really
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:07.720]  want to that's when i really have clear thoughts
[3:02:07.720 --> 3:02:10.680]  and i'm going to start doing a little ten minute show maybe every day
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:15.080]  that's just an upload to that audio uh where because i've got a big list of
[3:02:15.080 --> 3:02:18.920]  things i want to go over today and i'm i've got to cover that too
[3:02:18.920 --> 3:02:25.000]  so stay with us uh mark david justin stay with us corby
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:29.880]  stay with us hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:33.240]  it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever
[3:02:33.240 --> 3:02:36.840]  we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to
[3:02:36.840 --> 3:02:40.280]  stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the
[3:02:40.280 --> 3:02:43.080]  super dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:02:43.080 --> 3:02:46.920]  in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:50.440]  good old boy bailout for a special interest so they ignored your screams
[3:02:50.440 --> 3:02:52.600]  not to do it they turned off the telephones and
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:56.120]  email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:02:59.800]  out of thin air this money now owns the american and european banks
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:03.640]  the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings
[3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:07.560]  to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond
[3:03:07.560 --> 3:03:12.040]  many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[3:03:12.040 --> 3:03:16.040]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[3:03:16.040 --> 3:03:19.960]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:22.440]  in sight the private banks merging with our
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:25.560]  government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[3:03:25.560 --> 3:03:28.520]  shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:32.360]  stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be
[3:03:32.360 --> 3:03:34.920]  ready everything is zeroing in on food one third
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:37.800]  of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:41.080]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:44.520]  get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very
[3:03:44.520 --> 3:03:47.640]  important for you understand that by having a supply of storeable food the
[3:03:47.640 --> 3:03:50.840]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a
[3:03:50.840 --> 3:03:54.200]  mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[3:03:54.200 --> 3:03:57.480]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[3:03:57.480 --> 3:04:01.240]  you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from

[3:04:51.480 --> 3:05:05.720]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[3:05:05.720 --> 3:05:09.080]  all right we are back live we have 51 and a half minutes left
[3:05:09.080 --> 3:05:15.640]  in this final transmission of 2008 i want to go to mark david justin corby
[3:05:15.640 --> 3:05:20.360]  and others but before i do that i need to get to this body snatcher club
[3:05:20.360 --> 3:05:24.600]  first for around a time here and uh at least get some of the news
[3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:27.560]  and a little bit more detail then we'll take calls for the balance
[3:05:27.560 --> 3:05:33.000]  of the transmission last hour i was talking about genetic engineering and
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:36.360]  the fact that aspartame is the fecal matter of a type of
[3:05:36.360 --> 3:05:41.960]  genetically engineered ecoli bacteria now they came up with this in the 60s the
[3:05:41.960 --> 3:05:47.000]  army came up with this in the 1960s now i mean is that
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:52.440]  not body snatcher-esque uh i mean we have our own criminal
[3:05:52.440 --> 3:05:55.880]  species psychopath control freaks power
[3:05:55.880 --> 3:06:00.440]  hungry nuts nihilistic people running the world government they openly admit
[3:06:00.440 --> 3:06:03.240]  that they're eugenicists they openly admit that they want to reduce world
[3:06:03.240 --> 3:06:07.800]  population by at least 80 to 90 percent depending on which document you look at
[3:06:07.800 --> 3:06:12.520]  united nations biological diversity assessments and others
[3:06:12.520 --> 3:06:20.280]  state department random 200 and dr erick vianca has these standing ovations
[3:06:20.280 --> 3:06:23.400]  where he says kill 90 percent of us and you know the issue is the standing
[3:06:23.400 --> 3:06:27.080]  ovation the scientists are crying you know it's it's on the news oh yes kill
[3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:30.920]  everyone oh so beautiful while he projects a power point with a bunch of
[3:06:30.920 --> 3:06:34.120]  human skulls behind him and then as i said earlier
[3:06:34.120 --> 3:06:37.240]  his graduate students when i talked bad about him and it broke in national news
[3:06:37.240 --> 3:06:40.360]  a few years ago he's just one of thousands of these guys sent me
[3:06:40.360 --> 3:06:43.720]  threatening emails and saying here's my graduate paper i believe humans are a
[3:06:43.720 --> 3:06:47.400]  parasite we should all be gotten rid of and then i would search their name and
[3:06:47.400 --> 3:06:50.520]  it'd be them at a bio weapons lab in a white coat on the website
[3:06:50.520 --> 3:06:53.720]  it's like my god these people are in control of that
[3:06:53.720 --> 3:06:57.640]  they want to kill us and they're in bio weapons labs
[3:06:57.640 --> 3:07:03.640]  um and they're building 36 level four bio weapons labs under bio shield
[3:07:03.640 --> 3:07:07.640]  they know that potatoes they approved 15 20 years ago
[3:07:07.640 --> 3:07:11.240]  were killing the guinea pigs and rats they fed them to they know
[3:07:11.240 --> 3:07:15.160]  the aspartame killed at least half of the baby monkeys they gave it to when they
[3:07:15.160 --> 3:07:18.040]  approved it back in the 80s they knew prozac
[3:07:18.040 --> 3:07:22.120]  caused massive increases in suicide and psychopathic activities
[3:07:22.120 --> 3:07:25.560]  now we fortunate to put it on the label it'll stop your depression we make you
[3:07:25.560 --> 3:07:28.680]  want to kill your family and make you want to go shoot the school up
[3:07:28.680 --> 3:07:32.920]  all of this is going on this is diabolical by design
[3:07:32.920 --> 3:07:38.120]  and when you know this i feel like the guy at you know the doctor and body
[3:07:38.120 --> 3:07:41.320]  snatchers uh where you know he goes in and
[3:07:41.320 --> 3:07:44.440]  starts on the police department listen something is going on
[3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:47.960]  you know just something bad is happening that's how folks felt in
[3:07:47.960 --> 3:07:51.080]  nazi germany when it was leading up to it you know for the really bad times in
[3:07:51.080 --> 3:07:54.760]  the late 30s early 40s that's how people throughout history feel
[3:07:54.760 --> 3:08:00.440]  and and you know this is an analogy uh but the crises they face
[3:08:00.440 --> 3:08:04.920]  that we face in the real world are comparable but it's our own species
[3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:08.440]  who believes the elite believe there are new species they believe
[3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:11.240]  eugenics that they're going to make this god race
[3:08:11.240 --> 3:08:15.400]  it's the brave new world system that's what the un has said they want
[3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:18.600]  and it's and and and they believe it's their right to kill us
[3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:24.200]  they believe it's their right to to euthanizes to sterilizes as they've
[3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:27.960]  been caught adding sterilization compounds to the tetanus shots worldwide
[3:08:27.960 --> 3:08:31.640]  and the hiv's been declassified you know bio weapon
[3:08:31.640 --> 3:08:35.560]  it's part of the advanced uh cancer warfare program in the 70s
[3:08:35.560 --> 3:08:39.480]  it's a cancer virus all of this is going on it's just a cancer virus that
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:43.000]  attacks teal emphasize which are basically the generals or the commanders
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:46.120]  of your white blood cells you know they go out and command the forces they
[3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:49.560]  program everybody and i mean we know this is
[3:08:49.560 --> 3:08:53.000]  going on we know they're already using soft kill weapons on us
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:08:57.240]  we know we've gone from one in 33 with cancer 50 years ago to one in three
[3:08:57.240 --> 3:09:01.640]  we know we've gone from one in 500 depending on the study
[3:09:01.640 --> 3:09:05.240]  higher with diabetes to now one in five we know
[3:09:05.240 --> 3:09:09.800]  that uh that our life expectancy has gone down they have just
[3:09:09.800 --> 3:09:14.840]  infant mortality has has has gone down there's been less of that so so if you
[3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:18.040]  take that out of the equation the fact that babies survive more often
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:20.680]  the past around third of the children would die then you then you know we're
[3:09:20.680 --> 3:09:26.120]  living about 15 years less on average all of this is happening and and and
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:29.880]  you know i go to urban warfare drills 12 years ago
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:34.680]  11 years ago 10 years ago i witnessed marines with role players hired in
[3:09:34.680 --> 3:09:38.840]  california in maryland all over the country
[3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:42.600]  people send me footage from everywhere with marines walking up with machine
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:46.840]  guns telling people turn your cameras off then the local news says oh it's just a
[3:09:46.840 --> 3:09:49.480]  drill but then they're actually arresting people in the town
[3:09:49.480 --> 3:09:52.680]  they're working with the local boy scouts to tattle on their neighbors and do
[3:09:52.680 --> 3:09:56.840]  mock gun confiscations and the and the local boy scouts on video go out and
[3:09:56.840 --> 3:10:01.880]  help identify militia members and they have role players playing the part of
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:06.120]  us patriots and then i i i bring you the footage of all of this
[3:10:06.120 --> 3:10:09.240]  and people can't believe it oh no that's fake footage
[3:10:09.240 --> 3:10:12.200]  you know those helicopters landing and those troop carrying ships and those
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:16.920]  thousands of marines that's fake now they announce
[3:10:16.920 --> 3:10:20.600]  oh yes we're going to put 20 000 army and 5000 marines and

[3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:58.200]  the ivy league they openly set it up to bring in narcotics
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:02.120]  to launder the money to run these scams fractional reserve banking
[3:11:02.120 --> 3:11:06.120]  these private families issue the currency uh they control everything
[3:11:06.120 --> 3:11:10.280]  they're telling congress were under martial law bloomberg has the headline
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:16.280]  that war powers act has been declared and that congress is now under martial law
[3:11:16.280 --> 3:11:21.080]  and people just go on about their business like it's normal
[3:11:21.080 --> 3:11:24.920]  so let's go ahead and play this clip from the 1950s body
[3:11:24.920 --> 3:11:28.760]  snatchers uh right here from youtube i i suggest you

[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:34.840]  somewhere but i was rummaging around last night and couldn't find it so i
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:48.920]  just got to youtube uh but uh here it is
[3:11:48.920 --> 3:12:04.120]  oh dr hill and dr vestig well where's the patient

[3:12:40.520 --> 3:12:48.040]  suppose we just sit down over here dr bono and you tell me what happened
[3:12:48.040 --> 3:12:53.960]  well it started for me it started last thursday
[3:12:53.960 --> 3:12:56.760]  in response to an urgent message from my nurse i'd
[3:12:56.760 --> 3:13:00.840]  hurried home from a medical convention i've been attending
[3:13:00.840 --> 3:13:05.640]  at first glance everything looked the same
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:12.040]  it wasn't something evil had taken possession of the town
[3:13:12.040 --> 3:13:17.000]  these two all right so that's the intro now again
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:20.200]  people who know me in person i'm a calm nice friendly guy i start thinking
[3:13:20.200 --> 3:13:23.320]  about my god it's all real there's fema camps i've been to them
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:25.880]  uh you know they've been training for years to put us in camps and take our
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:28.680]  guns they're they're putting poison in the food i mean
[3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:31.800]  it's abnormal to not freak out like a human
[3:13:31.800 --> 3:13:35.880]  a homo sapien and say look out man we got a problem come on
[3:13:35.880 --> 3:13:38.920]  you know i mean that's what we do that's what your dog does as a mammal when
[3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:42.440]  somebody comes the door they they hop around they get upset you know
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:46.760]  i mean i'm normal folks it's abnormal to not be upset about this
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:50.040]  now that's that's from the beginning of the film and it i'm gonna tell you how
[3:13:50.040 --> 3:13:52.680]  it ends here is next to the end though and this
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:55.960]  is how i feel a lot of days and this is what i want to do i want to run down
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:13:59.160]  the street because this is really a normal behavior see we've just been
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:03.400]  eased into accepting it eased and oh be calm about it alex and people will
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:06.680]  listen to you bull we've been the most effective out
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:09.400]  there and we're not perfect i'm sick but we're still the most effective
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:12.920]  it's just kind of scary because we are able to reach out to people with the
[3:14:12.920 --> 3:14:16.600]  intellectual evidence but also we take hey man listen here
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:21.720]  this is serious business our species is under threat right now
[3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:25.880]  we got a bunch of criminal control freaks who just love crapping all over
[3:14:25.880 --> 3:14:29.480]  everything because they like to play god in control and they got to be stopped
[3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:32.680]  right now and they they're stopped when you wake up and admit
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:36.120]  the ambient nightmare has been turned up quietly when you weren't paying
[3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:40.840]  attention to now it's just at a crescendo here it is
[3:14:41.400 --> 3:14:45.400]  i've been afraid a lot of times in my life but i didn't know the real meaning
[3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:50.520]  of fear until until i'd kiss back me a moment's
[3:14:50.520 --> 3:14:55.560]  sleep and the girl i loved was an inhuman enemy bent on my destruction
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:14:59.080]  that moment's sleep was death to becky soul just as it had been for jack and
[3:14:59.080 --> 3:15:02.840]  teddy and dan koffman and all the rest their bodies were now hosts
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:06.280]  harboring an alien form of life a cosmic form
[3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:10.600]  which to survive must take over every human man so i ran i ran
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:13.320]  i ran as little jimmy grimoire had run the other day
[3:15:13.320 --> 3:15:16.440]  my only hope was to get away from san amir to get to the highway
[3:15:16.440 --> 3:15:34.040]  to warn the others of what was happening
[3:15:34.040 --> 3:15:38.840]  wait no no we gotta get away let him go they'll never believe me

[3:32:01.520 --> 3:32:03.480]  to be put on this earth
[3:32:03.480 --> 3:32:07.520]  and uh... and if god is good and he allowed it to those governments have to
[3:32:07.520 --> 3:32:08.920]  be good

[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:31.080]  is is going to be down hill into the latrine
[3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:33.320]  but i don't know nine is the slide
[3:33:33.320 --> 3:33:35.080]  into the surdline
[3:33:35.080 --> 3:33:37.920]  well you know maybe it has to happen you know you gotta hit bottom before you
[3:33:37.920 --> 3:33:40.400]  can but kickoff and get back to the surface man

[3:33:45.120 --> 3:33:48.040]  for the uh... new world order leaders out there
[3:33:48.040 --> 3:33:52.680]  hey guys we know who you are okay and we're not gonna forget it
[3:33:52.680 --> 3:33:54.960]  and and you're threatening our children
[3:33:54.960 --> 3:33:57.000]  you're threatening the lives of children
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:34:00.080]  that our children are supposed to have after us
[3:34:00.080 --> 3:34:03.840]  you know you've lied to us you've stolen from us you've swindled it
[3:34:03.840 --> 3:34:05.120]  and buffalo didn't
[3:34:05.120 --> 3:34:06.680]  left us out
[3:34:06.680 --> 3:34:10.760]  and illegally taxed it's a propaganda and i think it's been fooled and threatened
[3:34:10.760 --> 3:34:13.800]  and purposely poisoned and dumbed it down
[3:34:13.800 --> 3:34:15.280]  and extorted it
[3:34:15.280 --> 3:34:16.560]  and hurt it up
[3:34:16.560 --> 3:34:19.680]  and blackmailed and sold us a bill of good
[3:34:19.680 --> 3:34:22.680]  you're trying to destroy it
[3:34:22.680 --> 3:34:25.040]  let me get this straight
[3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:28.240]  we give bankers our money to hold for us
[3:34:28.240 --> 3:34:31.840]  we pay them for the privilege of writing checks against our own money that they
[3:34:31.840 --> 3:34:32.560]  are
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:37.520]  quote holding for us we pay penalties for any discrepancies in the monthly
[3:34:37.520 --> 3:34:39.320]  balance and
[3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:43.480]  they take the money that they are quote holding for us they wanted out of the
[3:34:43.480 --> 3:34:48.600]  ten times at interest they invested in shaky deals they make ridiculously risky
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:49.680]  loans
[3:34:49.680 --> 3:34:54.280]  they gamble in insurance scams against the money they've already gambled away
[3:34:54.280 --> 3:34:58.480]  in horrible long time long shot margin investment
[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:00.240]  they follow up cash
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:04.160]  in a million different ways they lose incredible amounts of
[3:35:04.160 --> 3:35:09.960]  money that they created from nothing out of our hard earned money
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:11.760]  and then
[3:35:11.760 --> 3:35:16.600]  when they've created squattered stolen gambled mismanaged and distributed all
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:17.320]  of this
[3:35:17.320 --> 3:35:18.040]  fake
[3:35:18.040 --> 3:35:18.960]  money
[3:35:18.960 --> 3:35:20.280]  to their cronies
[3:35:20.280 --> 3:35:22.840]  plus all of these illegal taxes
[3:35:22.840 --> 3:35:23.960]  they somehow
[3:35:23.960 --> 3:35:26.320]  quote lose everything
[3:35:26.320 --> 3:35:31.400]  and then the ability to hold on to the sea and search for a trillion times over
[3:35:31.400 --> 3:35:33.240]  and then they tell us
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:36.320]  that quote we are on the hook for it
[3:35:36.320 --> 3:35:38.240]  that's right how the hell does that work
[3:35:38.240 --> 3:35:40.240]  i gotta jump i appreciate your call
[3:35:40.240 --> 3:35:43.480]  uh... we gotta give everybody else time here
[3:35:43.480 --> 3:35:46.680]  and not just that we're not just on the hook for it we're gonna pay income tax
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:48.960]  for the foreign offshore banks at interest
[3:35:48.960 --> 3:35:49.800]  and
[3:35:49.800 --> 3:35:52.960]  the bankers are gonna be above congress declare the war powers act that's
[3:35:52.960 --> 3:35:54.160]  mainstream news
[3:35:54.160 --> 3:35:57.960]  and they will then set up world government that we pay taxes to for
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:36:00.720]  carbon tax because it's for the earth
[3:36:00.720 --> 3:36:04.400]  we've got a watch idiot mainline liberals dance around and for the uh...
[3:36:04.400 --> 3:36:07.960]  i'm for the uh... i pay a tax
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:11.760]  you know it just cynical scam
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:15.360]  we're gonna go to uh... justin rich and chris before the transmission ends
[3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:16.400]  uh...
[3:36:16.400 --> 3:36:20.600]  i'm gonna do a huge news blitz here just a moment but i wanted to bring ted up
[3:36:20.600 --> 3:36:23.000]  right now for five minutes uh...
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  at the deals ted is offering there's basically no profit he bought gold last
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:27.720]  week
[3:36:27.720 --> 3:36:31.600]  when it was seven seventy this is the last day he was telling me he can do this
[3:36:31.600 --> 3:36:35.080]  because it's now eight ninety something today
[3:36:35.080 --> 3:36:38.520]  yes it's up over a hundred twenty dollars from when he bought it last week
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:41.760]  he's almost out of the frank's the sovereigns
[3:36:41.760 --> 3:36:44.920]  uh... i don't know he has buffaloes left i gotta ask him
[3:36:44.920 --> 3:36:48.560]  uh... the american eagles at that price now it took two weeks ago we were
[3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:50.240]  selling for seven hundred
[3:36:50.240 --> 3:36:54.360]  now it's seven seventy an ounce when it's eight ninety
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:36:55.840]  and if you want to wait
[3:36:55.840 --> 3:36:59.440]  till and i'm on the same way you know i got a lot of money for a few silver
[3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:01.280]  coins a few gold coins
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:04.920]  i need them it's so busy i keep meaning to call ten of them you know as i'm gonna
[3:37:04.920 --> 3:37:06.720]  do that today
[3:37:06.720 --> 3:37:07.720]  before
[3:37:07.720 --> 3:37:12.440]  i've got to pay eight fifty
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:13.680]  a thousand whatever
[3:37:13.680 --> 3:37:15.560]  now to say everywhere else in the industry
[3:37:15.560 --> 3:37:16.680]  gold
[3:37:16.680 --> 3:37:19.600]  it's hard to find most places are sold out of you can only buy one coin and
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:21.840]  there's a twenty thirty forty percent
[3:37:21.840 --> 3:37:23.000]  mark up on it
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:24.920]  not with ten you don't just get
[3:37:24.920 --> 3:37:28.680]  no no markup above what spot is
[3:37:28.680 --> 3:37:30.120]  you get
[3:37:30.120 --> 3:37:32.600]  the fact that he bought this when it was a hundred
[3:37:32.600 --> 3:37:36.760]  and twenty dollars less than it is now
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:40.080]  and of course you know he he bought a little bit of a premium and you know has
[3:37:40.080 --> 3:37:42.200]  a four percent of their for the brokers or whatever you know to make the
[3:37:42.200 --> 3:37:46.320]  transaction but but no one can get even close to this
[3:37:46.320 --> 3:37:48.880]  because he bought gold seven seventy level
[3:37:48.880 --> 3:37:50.240]  a big position
[3:37:50.240 --> 3:37:54.080]  couple week what we can have a go now it's eight ninety
[3:37:54.080 --> 3:37:56.320]  eighty five eighty nine going back and forth
[3:37:56.320 --> 3:37:57.440]  uh...
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:38:01.800]  it's unheard of right around christmas for this to happen as long as slow time
[3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:04.480]  regardless folks uh...
[3:38:04.480 --> 3:38:07.920]  gold would have to drop by a hundred plus dollars an ounce for this to be a bad
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:09.720]  deal for you
[3:38:09.720 --> 3:38:13.120]  understand and and and all the evidence shows the next year it's only going up
[3:38:13.120 --> 3:38:13.680]  so
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:17.760]  get into golden silver now do not procrastinate do not wait
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:20.080]  uh... ten anderson uh...
[3:38:20.080 --> 3:38:22.640]  tell folks the coin offer you got today
[3:38:22.640 --> 3:38:26.120]  yeah you like you said alex gold is up another ten dollars
[3:38:26.120 --> 3:38:30.600]  i'm still offering the franks the same prices yesterday two or five
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:34.000]  i also have the british sovereigns two fifty four
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:36.400]  how people have to realize when you're buying coins
[3:38:36.400 --> 3:38:38.200]  nobody buys coins at spot
[3:38:38.200 --> 3:38:41.280]  not even when spots at seven seventy it's a little higher than spot
[3:38:41.280 --> 3:38:44.040]  just to get them even in the wholesale market that's what it is
[3:38:44.040 --> 3:38:45.160]  well when the when the
[3:38:45.160 --> 3:38:46.320]  spot price
[3:38:46.320 --> 3:38:48.560]  goes up and i've already taken on a position
[3:38:48.560 --> 3:38:51.160]  it eats up that premium there's nothing left that's why
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:54.560]  if you call around the united states to other dealers to try to find these
[3:38:54.560 --> 3:38:55.240]  coins
[3:38:55.240 --> 3:38:58.440]  at these prices you're not gonna because nobody else has them at these
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:38:59.400]  prices
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:03.400]  and then again that that buffalo quite i i like that point to
[3:39:03.400 --> 3:39:06.640]  and i i'm just keeping a very limited because i know i'm just getting a little
[3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:08.120]  trickle them coming in
[3:39:08.120 --> 3:39:10.680]  but i will commit to doing another fifty today
[3:39:10.680 --> 3:39:12.800]  and uh... and they're there
[3:39:12.800 --> 3:39:17.120]  you know silver has been a hot item to everybody's forget about silver eleven
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:18.840]  dollars and fifteen cents an hour
[3:39:18.840 --> 3:39:20.080]  and ounce today
[3:39:20.080 --> 3:39:23.960]  and uh... in here we're looking at uh... silver walking liberty has still
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:25.480]  at that seven seventy level
[3:39:25.480 --> 3:39:27.960]  or in this case right around nine dollars
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:32.320]  in sixty cents an ounce for silver and there's a little eight forty again
[3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:35.560]  i mean don't confuse it i mean you're buying coins that normally trade a
[3:39:35.560 --> 3:39:39.620]  premium in the marketplace nobody selling coins right at spot
[3:39:39.620 --> 3:39:41.360]  yet at this particular moment
[3:39:41.360 --> 3:39:43.680]  you're able to get the coin so close to mouth
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:44.640]  from mitis
[3:39:44.640 --> 3:39:47.280]  and you can't find them like that anywhere else because the fact that it
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:48.480]  picked up a position
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:52.040]  let's explain people aren't just buying gold right now at the eight eighty five
[3:39:52.040 --> 3:39:53.040]  eight ninety level
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:56.760]  they're paying huge premiums because the dealers are having to pay that you've
[3:39:56.760 --> 3:39:58.540]  been in business thirty years
[3:39:58.540 --> 3:40:01.960]  you've all you've never screwed any of these big international dealers so
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:06.360]  you're able to get gold and silver when most people can't even get it and
[3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:07.400]  you're getting it
[3:40:07.400 --> 3:40:10.760]  uh... you know you're buying big when you know it's down so that you can get
[3:40:10.760 --> 3:40:14.520]  people huge savings as it goes up but again two weeks ago
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:17.600]  you had people at a seven hundred and four dollar position
[3:40:17.600 --> 3:40:21.160]  now it's at seven seventy clearly next time we're gonna be saying it's an eight
[3:40:21.160 --> 3:40:24.680]  hundred dollar position and gold nine hundred and something by now
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:28.280]  they'll still have the deal for you next week but it probably won't be this good
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:31.480]  the way everything's going with the dollar in the new world order
[3:40:31.480 --> 3:40:35.040]  folks the safest bet out there is golden silver is a hundred percent safe is
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:40.520]  there any panacea or or or a paragon of you everything being fine no
[3:40:40.520 --> 3:40:42.480]  but this is what i believe in
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:44.080]  this is where i would put my money
[3:40:44.080 --> 3:40:46.600]  and you're insane if you don't put twenty thirty percent
[3:40:46.600 --> 3:40:48.800]  of your liquid assets in gold and silver
[3:40:48.800 --> 3:40:52.200]  uh... silver for the poor man is the best deal that's what i've mainly invested
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:52.920]  in
[3:40:52.920 --> 3:40:56.280]  uh... and literally that's invested you know i got that little vaulted a bank
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:40:59.960]  just so that the dollar becomes worthless i can at least cash in the
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:01.800]  silver and pay my employees for a month
[3:41:01.800 --> 3:41:03.320]  or or maybe
[3:41:03.320 --> 3:41:06.600]  uh... you know i mean that we're in an emergency situation
[3:41:06.600 --> 3:41:10.320]  and uh... ten is the reason we have minus resources we have genesis
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:12.600]  and that's why i've been having him up a lot lately because this is one of the
[3:41:12.600 --> 3:41:13.760]  best solutions

[3:52:19.560 --> 3:52:23.080]  was gonna get rid of NAFTA and get total betrayal oh that's the trade
[3:52:23.080 --> 3:52:26.120]  representative the US trade representative who's unaccountable to
[3:52:26.120 --> 3:52:33.160]  the Congress well Congress I never got to it today Congress is an info or story
[3:52:33.160 --> 3:52:36.160]  that was in the Associated Press is bitching at North com saying you've
[3:52:36.160 --> 3:52:39.600]  signed deals to use foreign troops you've signed deals to put troops on our
[3:52:39.600 --> 3:52:44.440]  streets you didn't consult us I mean this is happening ladies and gentlemen

[3:52:50.440 --> 3:52:54.280]  air rich hit me hard let's go right on thanks for taking my call Alex I'm a
[3:52:54.280 --> 3:52:58.440]  Marine Corps vet and I hold degrees in psychology and philosophy and I'm not
[3:52:58.440 --> 3:53:02.520]  saying that to brag I'm just saying that I've been on the inside of the machine
[3:53:02.520 --> 3:53:06.320]  on many levels my so-called psych education which by the way was at
[3:53:06.320 --> 3:53:09.400]  Western Carolina University where they did a lot of the human genome project
[3:53:09.400 --> 3:53:13.000]  that education disturbed me I'll give an example the Milgram experiments and
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:17.120]  something else more important to me was the concept of learned helplessness the
[3:53:17.120 --> 3:53:20.960]  experiments where they would place puppies into cubicles with electric
[3:53:20.960 --> 3:53:24.880]  torture plates and consecutively shot the poor animals to the point of utter
[3:53:24.880 --> 3:53:29.480]  submission now further while I was in the Marine Corps I spent some time in
[3:53:29.480 --> 3:53:34.520]  Guantanamo you know what stop there can I go into overdrive absolutely no no
[3:53:34.520 --> 3:53:38.360]  I mean we're in a studio and I haven't I need to ask my guys how do I get these
[3:53:38.360 --> 3:53:42.080]  Genesis callers transferred over can you get this phone number up real fast so I
[3:53:42.080 --> 3:53:45.520]  can give it to them so they can call in because I want to get now now I know
[3:53:45.520 --> 3:53:49.040]  about the Milgram study and others that's where they found that they could get
[3:53:49.040 --> 3:53:54.680]  something like 90% of people one of them was 70 to torture people to death if
[3:53:54.680 --> 3:53:59.120]  they were ordered to do so right and then they've done it with rats and
[3:53:59.120 --> 3:54:03.560]  puppies on how to shock the public into submission take us out and then I'm
[3:54:03.560 --> 3:54:06.800]  gonna finish up an overdrive with you because a special show into the year
[3:54:06.800 --> 3:54:10.040]  we'll do 20 minutes overdrive but I'm gonna keep you on the Genesis line I'll
[3:54:10.040 --> 3:54:12.120]  go a few minutes over on then and then we'll put up the number for everybody
[3:54:12.120 --> 3:54:19.000]  else Rich and Chris and Ronnie and Rosalia Rosalin in Canada but real fast
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:23.640]  tell folks about the torturing the puppy what they would do is put a puppy
[3:54:23.640 --> 3:54:27.640]  inside of a cage and inside it they have this electric shock plate and they
[3:54:27.640 --> 3:54:33.080]  would call the puppy or pull it over with food or some other means to get it
[3:54:33.080 --> 3:54:36.120]  over and then they would shock and of course the animal is gonna react and
[3:54:36.120 --> 3:54:41.320]  jump away well then in the next stage they would put a larger plate and they
[3:54:41.320 --> 3:54:44.520]  would continue to increase the size of the plate until it was completely covered
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:48.240]  the bottom of the cage so the dog actually had nowhere to run nowhere to
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:52.480]  hide and it would cower in the corner while being shocked just just shivering
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:54:59.160]  and they're testing with the television the culture to train us to do that stay
[3:54:59.160 --> 3:55:03.240]  there we're gonna go into overdrive and the only place to hear it is info
[3:55:03.240 --> 3:55:07.840]  wars.com on those audio screens end of view it on prisonplanet.tv we're

[3:56:08.280 --> 3:56:11.200]  others can call too but I want to give them a chance to get in first so let's
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:15.440]  open the phone system up now so they can call in finishing up with you Mark tell
[3:56:15.440 --> 3:56:25.880]  people about what they're teaching people go ahead or or or or rich rich I'm
[3:56:25.880 --> 3:56:30.360]  sorry go ahead I'm out is it cool I wanted to say something about the time
[3:56:30.360 --> 3:56:34.200]  that I spent in Guantanamo that's cool yeah I mean I would like to do that but
[3:56:34.200 --> 3:56:39.560]  but finish up with what happens with the puppy ultimately the the dog as the
[3:56:39.560 --> 3:56:45.000]  phrase implies learned helplessness it's basically a means by which to
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:49.920]  completely utterly in control the animal to where it will not react it will not
[3:56:49.920 --> 3:56:54.000]  even come to get its own food it would literally the animals would starve rather
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:56:59.440]  than that subject himself yeah it's it's it's called capitulation and and and
[3:56:59.440 --> 3:57:03.320]  they admit then the rat dog and monkey studies and now they've done it with
[3:57:03.320 --> 3:57:07.160]  humans at Guantanamo I think you're about to get to that I'm guessing what
[3:57:07.160 --> 3:57:10.600]  they found because it's a laboratory they admit that so they take innocent
[3:57:10.600 --> 3:57:15.920]  people there and I want to hear this story what they're doing is for listeners
[3:57:15.920 --> 3:57:19.760]  that understand when they taser you for no reason when they arrest a girl for
[3:57:19.760 --> 3:57:25.440]  giving a friend a over-the-counter cough drop or they're training you that the
[3:57:25.440 --> 3:57:29.680]  government can do whatever corrupt asinine abusive things they want to set
[3:57:29.680 --> 3:57:34.400]  that precedent and to make you feel like you're helpless and can't resist it's
[3:57:34.400 --> 3:57:38.400]  it's total psychological warfare to make you feel helpless we are not helpless
[3:57:38.400 --> 3:57:41.560]  we are going to beat the new world order now you got the floor for the next three
[3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:46.560]  minutes sir go ahead and tell folks about what you saw at Guantanamo Bay now
[3:57:46.560 --> 3:57:51.320]  what I saw in Guantanamo this isn't relating to the psychological aspect
[3:57:51.320 --> 3:57:58.080]  I was in 1995 during operation C signal I I saw firsthand the way the Clinton
[3:57:58.080 --> 3:58:01.440]  administration and the military treated the the Cuban folks like a quick
[3:58:01.440 --> 3:58:06.480]  example my unit was on a morning run and because operation C signal was all
[3:58:06.480 --> 3:58:11.640]  branch of the service there's an army unit and they were passing cigarettes to
[3:58:11.640 --> 3:58:15.600]  eight nine ten-year-old children through the fence the Cuban migrants and I
[3:58:15.600 --> 3:58:20.200]  immediately broke ranks and did as did most of my unit and the branch
[3:58:20.200 --> 3:58:24.400]  rivalry stoked us and we kicked the snide of these guys whom we found out later
[3:58:24.400 --> 3:58:29.160]  with the so-called elite 82nd Airborne and a bunch of marine computer
[3:58:29.160 --> 3:58:33.600]  programmers a mechanic and some radio techs whipped them pretty good another
[3:58:33.600 --> 3:58:36.320]  time I have a more gruesome story perhaps for another day if you're
[3:58:36.320 --> 3:58:41.480]  interested that but I wanted to tell me some story go ahead okay I was in a
[3:58:41.480 --> 3:58:46.000]  camp I was guarding this particular camp and there was a family they brought
[3:58:46.000 --> 3:58:49.800]  him was a large group of folks they brought him one night and I got to be
[3:58:49.800 --> 3:58:52.800]  good friends with a doctor fellow he had really good English my Spanish is
[3:58:52.800 --> 3:58:57.480]  terrible and he told me what happened of a family member of his living in Miami
[3:58:57.480 --> 3:59:01.760]  sent them a boat and all these folks got on board this boat and they were high
[3:59:01.760 --> 3:59:06.240]  telling to Miami well they were just about out of Cuban waters and no bear
[3:59:06.240 --> 3:59:09.840]  mind this is just the story I got from the doctor and the Cuban Coast Guard
[3:59:09.840 --> 3:59:14.240]  without any warning open fire on them and they they they called for bullhorn
[3:59:14.240 --> 3:59:17.920]  we've got women we've got children please stop well they didn't and so they
[3:59:17.920 --> 3:59:22.280]  sped away trying to evade them and just as the American Coast Guard you know
[3:59:22.280 --> 3:59:27.000]  intercepted there was a pregnant lady on board and she fell hit her head broke
[3:59:27.000 --> 3:59:31.520]  her neck well that was about that time about three days later Janet Reno came
[3:59:31.520 --> 3:59:36.200]  down to Guantanamo and made the declaration that pretty much all the
[3:59:36.200 --> 3:59:40.400]  Cubans are going to be sent back well this this doctor fellow told me he was
[3:59:40.400 --> 3:59:44.240]  terrified and he told me what happened to several of his doctor friends who
[3:59:44.240 --> 3:59:50.760]  spoke out in the government and whatnot but um these these folks were sent
[3:59:50.760 --> 3:59:59.760]  essentially the entire group of them were charged with murder amazing mind
[3:59:59.760 --> 4:00:03.560]  boggling and it was so so so so they were charged with murder for her
[4:00:03.560 --> 4:00:09.680]  breaking her neck as if their attempt to escape the freedom was a murder yes sir
[4:00:09.680 --> 4:00:13.720]  well that's tyranny that's Cuba for you and that's what we're becoming here it's
[4:00:13.720 --> 4:00:19.400]  so sad now what was the other story um you were about to say something else and
[4:00:19.400 --> 4:00:22.760]  I said no tell that story oh it wasn't much of a story of just moral of a
[4:00:22.760 --> 4:00:25.960]  declaration they're reverting back to the learned helplessness in my own
[4:00:25.960 --> 4:00:30.040]  awakening which you know coupled with a lot of problems I had you know major
[4:00:30.040 --> 4:00:33.760]  depression and it kept me very reclusive and very apathetic for way too long and
[4:00:33.760 --> 4:00:38.280]  I saw I guys about three months ago and I was awakened and I want to put out a
[4:00:38.280 --> 4:00:43.000]  message to the New World Order your indoctrination camps failed you hijacked
[4:00:43.000 --> 4:00:47.560]  my beloved Marine Corps and although I'm no longer enlisted I swore an eternal
[4:00:47.560 --> 4:00:51.920]  oath to the Constitution and the Republic and I dedicate my life to your
[4:00:51.920 --> 4:00:56.400]  complete destruction and lastly Alex I appreciate your brother you're a 21st

[4:03:14.800 --> 4:03:18.880]  issues and topics and points I wanted to make so we'll take a few calls and I'll
[4:03:18.880 --> 4:03:22.600]  hit a few of those and we'll end this transmission let's go ahead and talk to
[4:03:22.600 --> 4:03:29.760]  Chris in Florida Chris you're on the air hi thanks for calling back hey man
[4:03:29.760 --> 4:03:34.440]  hey I think we did a lot of good in 2008 a lot of people showed up to protest
[4:03:34.440 --> 4:03:40.720]  Soderbergh and more people like you said the never protesting the Federal Reserve
[4:03:40.720 --> 4:03:44.160]  know that it's private but what I wanted to call you about was something that I
[4:03:44.160 --> 4:03:49.000]  had come across a lot job hunting and I was wondering if you knew about it knew
[4:03:49.000 --> 4:03:52.320]  what were they going to do with it it's called that the Minnesota multi-phasic
[4:03:52.320 --> 4:04:00.840]  personality inventory yeah they give you these big psychology 600 question test
[4:04:00.840 --> 4:04:05.720]  to see if you're deceptive or evasive or to get your personality type and as
[4:04:05.720 --> 4:04:09.880]  freaked out as people are about those and insurance companies give companies
[4:04:09.880 --> 4:04:14.440]  breaks to do it so they're standardizing it the real thing is Google or your
[4:04:14.440 --> 4:04:17.680]  digital cable it's tracking what you watch and do and that's much more detailed
[4:04:17.680 --> 4:04:22.440]  psychological algorithmic profile but but no I mean tell me specifically what
[4:04:22.440 --> 4:04:28.200]  was happening with the with the psychological profile test well was a
[4:04:28.200 --> 4:04:32.880]  particular job interview I had spoken one-on-one with one of these men
[4:04:32.880 --> 4:04:37.320]  management people and you know he liked me we got along great and everything I
[4:04:37.320 --> 4:04:44.320]  went and I took the test and afterwards I wasn't supposed to I guess enter it you
[4:04:44.320 --> 4:04:48.640]  know when I finished and when I did it broke it down to some subcategories and
[4:04:48.640 --> 4:04:55.680]  it said you know follows orders excessively it said sociability and
[4:04:55.680 --> 4:05:00.320]  then it said fair it said you know like listening to good fair poor certain
[4:05:00.320 --> 4:05:04.480]  touch and then at the bottom it said overall fit for a job and then it said
[4:05:04.480 --> 4:05:08.280]  good so when he came over he reviewed it he said well you weren't supposed to you
[4:05:08.280 --> 4:05:13.040]  know finish the test and see the answers and I said what says overall fit good and
[4:05:13.040 --> 4:05:18.200]  he said well I've never seen an excessive before I have to go and you
[4:05:18.200 --> 4:05:22.280]  know review this with my boss so you know here we had gotten along real well and
[4:05:22.280 --> 4:05:26.000]  everything I thought I was gonna get the job and is that pretty much blue for me
[4:05:26.000 --> 4:05:29.080]  but if I was following orders excessive that wouldn't have pressed enter I'm
[4:05:29.080 --> 4:05:35.160]  pretty satisfied so I just like those tests aren't those tests aren't complex
[4:05:35.160 --> 4:05:42.600]  enough to accurately peg somebody of humans are too multifaceted but it's
[4:05:42.600 --> 4:05:46.800]  just it it's just more crap it you look everybody plays God psychologist
[4:05:46.800 --> 4:05:50.520]  psychiatrist know it all these little petty managers feel like they're an
[4:05:50.520 --> 4:05:54.760]  elite guilds and it's all a bunch of quackery and that's why our country's
[4:05:54.760 --> 4:05:59.320]  falling apart yeah I just wanted to get your thoughts on it Alex I appreciate
[4:05:59.320 --> 4:06:06.360]  you now you too my friend yeah this is like the oracles for 30 40 years hundreds
[4:06:06.360 --> 4:06:09.960]  of thousands of people went to prison probably millions but I know hundreds of
[4:06:09.960 --> 4:06:13.200]  thousands went to prison off lie detectors and it turned out a lot of
[4:06:13.200 --> 4:06:20.720]  more completely innocent they say I'm not lying it was an excuse for the FBI
[4:06:20.720 --> 4:06:24.400]  and it turned out the FBI crime lab frame tens of thousands that's admitted
[4:06:24.400 --> 4:06:28.040]  that Frederick waters went public about that Dr. Frank waters and all these other
[4:06:28.040 --> 4:06:31.440]  state crime labs and city crime labs came out a few years ago the Houston crime
[4:06:31.440 --> 4:06:34.720]  lab framed anybody and everybody you know they would just say anything was
[4:06:34.720 --> 4:06:39.360]  cocaine they'd say proof you murdered somebody but what they do is they just
[4:06:39.360 --> 4:06:45.840]  say oh well the lie detector says you're a liar well it got proven that that was
[4:06:45.840 --> 4:06:51.080]  a fraud now the reason I say this is like an oracle is that in Greece they
[4:06:51.080 --> 4:06:58.860]  would have a drug doubt Vestal virgin on hallucinogenic drugs and she would
[4:06:58.860 --> 4:07:02.480]  mumble and babble a bunch of bulls to the royalty and people would come pay to
[4:07:02.480 --> 4:07:05.720]  hear what I had to say and then a priest would say and she'd be like ah
[4:07:05.720 --> 4:07:12.320]  boogie mazula pacanda or you know whatever a booga booga or our cadian
[4:07:12.320 --> 4:07:18.980]  ice isis you know who knows what babble and then the priest would say they say
[4:07:18.980 --> 4:07:23.440]  give more money to the priesthood I mean literally and that's why you know they
[4:07:23.440 --> 4:07:27.200]  have it in like 300 kind of a stylized deal you know where the enemy comes and
[4:07:27.200 --> 4:07:33.160]  pays off the oracles to tell them they're gonna lose I mean it's the same
[4:07:33.160 --> 4:07:37.120]  thing over and over again so the oracle the lie detector says you're guilty
[4:07:37.120 --> 4:07:43.160]  turns out it's total bull now it could be used when somebody was lying to say
[4:07:43.160 --> 4:07:47.440]  oh this shows you're being evasive to trick people thinking it was magic into
[4:07:47.440 --> 4:07:51.640]  admitting they were lying so yeah but again the operator can lie the machine
[4:07:51.640 --> 4:07:59.120]  is not anywhere close to a hundred percent it's bull it's called quackery
[4:07:59.120 --> 4:08:03.560]  okay you like if I claim this this pin could find water and you know sold it
[4:08:03.560 --> 4:08:07.560]  for a million bucks with this magical pen blessed by bubble schnobble you know
[4:08:07.560 --> 4:08:14.360]  says says that it can find water I'm sure I could find an idiot to buy it so
[4:08:14.360 --> 4:08:19.840]  it's the same thing over and over again now they have passive brain scanners in
[4:08:19.840 --> 4:08:23.480]  the airports why the brain scanner showed an area of your brain was upset or
[4:08:23.480 --> 4:08:28.600]  oh you know now they'll show you an image of a dead body or an image of the
[4:08:28.600 --> 4:08:33.560]  crime scene and if your brain registers that it's seen it before that means that
[4:08:33.560 --> 4:08:38.400]  you did the murder but we've seen millions of simulated murders and most
[4:08:38.400 --> 4:08:41.920]  people have seen something similar because of television to that so there's
[4:08:41.920 --> 4:08:46.120]  already studies showing that these computer programs that they're
[4:08:46.120 --> 4:08:53.320]  convicting people with it's bull I mean they show you a you know picture of a
[4:08:53.320 --> 4:08:59.560]  14 year old naked girl and it's similar enough to a 20 year old naked woman that
[4:08:59.560 --> 4:09:04.720]  your brain clicks recognize they go all that said he's a pedophile prison there's
[4:09:04.720 --> 4:09:09.400]  cases of that now or you know they show you a woman you know handcuffed with her
[4:09:09.400 --> 4:09:15.080]  guts cut out murder photo oh your your brain says you recognize that well of
[4:09:15.080 --> 4:09:20.160]  course it recognizes it it's seen that a million times on television similar
[4:09:20.160 --> 4:09:24.160]  things the brain you know has his categories as a computer electrochemical
[4:09:24.160 --> 4:09:28.480]  and they've got new lie detectors they hook you up to and they go these tests
[4:09:28.480 --> 4:09:34.920]  on this bull and it is true that these multi-phase you know test can find a
[4:09:34.920 --> 4:09:38.960]  low-grade moron liar or someone who thinks they're smart and deceptive there's
[4:09:38.960 --> 4:09:46.440]  lots of those but generally it's it's it's it's it's not reliable I mean it's
[4:09:46.440 --> 4:09:50.760]  not anywhere near a hundred percent a lot of people be lazy and just kind of
[4:09:50.760 --> 4:09:55.680]  one may find out they're lazy so there's all sorts of stuff going on also the
[4:09:55.680 --> 4:09:58.920]  elite is having to do all this because they destroyed society by design the
[4:09:58.920 --> 4:10:06.680]  public's completely fallen apart my dad was sent he's a medical company mid-level
[4:10:06.680 --> 4:10:11.280]  mid-high you know what do you say between mid and high you know kind of a
[4:10:11.280 --> 4:10:15.840]  lower-level high-level executive for a pretty good sized medical company
[4:10:15.840 --> 4:10:22.360]  and they send him to this expensive multi-thousand dollar a person and
[4:10:22.360 --> 4:10:24.880]  then people from all over the country but happened to be at the Four Seasons a
[4:10:24.880 --> 4:10:28.200]  few years ago and he calls up and he goes I'm out here in the lobby right now
[4:10:28.200 --> 4:10:31.680]  they're telling us world government's good everything's wonderful but the
[4:10:31.680 --> 4:10:36.240]  New World Order wanted to done everybody down to make them surf slaves that would
[4:10:36.240 --> 4:10:41.080]  you know basically follow easy orders and that the German kindergarten
[4:10:41.080 --> 4:10:44.760]  brainwashing model worked too well so everybody's annihilated now so they're
[4:10:44.760 --> 4:10:50.160]  either immoral or stupid or both and so now what corporations want to find is
[4:10:50.160 --> 4:10:55.080]  actually anti-New World Order people who are still intelligent and moral but
[4:10:55.080 --> 4:10:57.960]  then your problem is that if you're doing something immoral you can't really
[4:10:57.960 --> 4:11:01.760]  control on me and all this stuff and I mean that's what it is they have just
[4:11:01.760 --> 4:11:07.040]  annihilated the public to where they're just a but because they've dumbed us
[4:11:07.040 --> 4:11:11.280]  down just a bestial level where they just program primitive responses then
[4:11:11.280 --> 4:11:14.280]  they just punch those buttons and to make us more easily controllable they've
[4:11:14.280 --> 4:11:21.960]  dumbed us down narrowed our psychological vision our overall psyche's plane of
[4:11:21.960 --> 4:11:27.520]  view you know the overall universe and it just is devastating it's a great
[4:11:27.520 --> 4:11:31.600]  crime against humanity and they're just now getting started so they have to ask
[4:11:31.600 --> 4:11:35.520]  all these questionnaires and have drug tests and spy on their employees because
[4:11:35.520 --> 4:11:40.760]  the public itself is just filled with scum and trash and criminals and delusion
[4:11:40.760 --> 4:11:43.840]  the public is under mass delusion instead of wanting to know the truth instead
[4:11:43.840 --> 4:11:46.400]  of really wanting to know what's really going on with yourself your neighbors
[4:11:46.400 --> 4:11:49.320]  of your life instead of wanting to get real find out the fundamentals of
[4:11:49.320 --> 4:11:53.960]  humanity being alive on this planet people have gotten into lying to
[4:11:53.960 --> 4:11:57.760]  themselves being deceitful of being delusional imagining there's something
[4:11:57.760 --> 4:12:00.840]  they're not whether it's good or bad you know Madison Avenue is there to make
[4:12:00.840 --> 4:12:05.640]  good people who have who are really high quality and wondrous souls just
[4:12:05.640 --> 4:12:10.320]  literally radiating with potential and power and beauty and creativity and
[4:12:10.320 --> 4:12:14.360]  the universe they make you feel inadequate because your hips are a little
[4:12:14.360 --> 4:12:18.360]  plump which is actually what men want you don't look like a 10-year-old boy
[4:12:18.360 --> 4:12:23.920]  you know when you're a 30-year-old woman because that's the that's the the men
[4:12:23.920 --> 4:12:27.960]  that run the fashion thing like 10-year-old boys they don't like 30-year-old
[4:12:27.960 --> 4:12:32.160]  women and so that's why men all these studies don't like the supermodel look
[4:12:32.160 --> 4:12:39.160]  they like the you know what do they call it milfs you know I'm getting a lot of
[4:12:39.160 --> 4:12:46.120]  control here the point is is that this is the mass programming and there's
[4:12:46.120 --> 4:12:51.360]  thousands of different points along those those lines and they've just wrecked
[4:12:51.360 --> 4:12:54.440]  society to make it more easily controllable but they haven't gotten to
[4:12:54.440 --> 4:12:59.000]  their robotic society yet where the mechanized robots and drones and
[4:12:59.000 --> 4:13:02.840]  militaries are in place yet and so they're having trouble finishing their
[4:13:02.840 --> 4:13:07.280]  new world order because they've wrecked people so bad and so they make good
[4:13:07.280 --> 4:13:12.400]  people feel inadequate they give men a false image of what a warrior is not
[4:13:12.400 --> 4:13:16.640]  helping your society your culture your children not being informed it's loving
[4:13:16.640 --> 4:13:22.480]  football and acting tough and having tattoos and writing a Harley and I'm
[4:13:22.480 --> 4:13:24.200]  not saying you're bad if you have tattoos around Harley you know what I
[4:13:24.200 --> 4:13:30.920]  mean that's their whole image you know just kind of real stupid but but on the
[4:13:30.920 --> 4:13:35.320]  other side it's about being people feel inadequate and also then making the
[4:13:35.320 --> 4:13:38.840]  petty yuppies and other subclasses feel real secure and good and their own
[4:13:38.840 --> 4:13:44.120]  little niches which are pre-programmed little social engineer niches that are
[4:13:44.120 --> 4:13:48.080]  controlled and serviced by substrat a propaganda conduits from the overall
[4:13:48.080 --> 4:13:53.640]  master matrix integration center okay so the big mainframe comes up with the
[4:13:53.640 --> 4:13:58.520]  different countercultures through the systems and they deliver that down knowing
[4:13:58.520 --> 4:14:02.360]  people want to be individualistic and rebel they give them false individualistic
[4:14:02.360 --> 4:14:08.000]  rebel constructs to enter into in the overall scheme and then they play the
[4:14:08.000 --> 4:14:12.840]  different subgroups off against each other in that nexus port and they got
[4:14:12.840 --> 4:14:18.160]  the police in their subculture they've got all the other subcultures and so
[4:14:18.160 --> 4:14:20.800]  that's why I found even bashing the police which I still primitively do
[4:14:20.800 --> 4:14:26.800]  actually plays in to the overall vortices as they play the public off
[4:14:26.800 --> 4:14:30.360]  against the police when we're really all in the same substrat a together with the
[4:14:30.360 --> 4:14:34.040]  enemy and placements engaging in the social engineering attacks against us
[4:14:34.040 --> 4:14:39.320]  all only by breaking through those membrane separation points and seeing
[4:14:39.320 --> 4:14:43.480]  our commonality and our common goal and our common future to work together in
[4:14:43.480 --> 4:14:47.920]  defense of humanity and honor and liberty can we overall invade the matrix
[4:14:47.920 --> 4:14:51.840]  level system before it gets to its next phase when it'll be really hard to get
[4:14:51.840 --> 4:14:55.800]  rid of when the armies are robotic when and when when the attack craft are all
[4:14:55.800 --> 4:15:00.080]  pre-programmed and drone where one globalist can launch an entire worldwide
[4:15:00.080 --> 4:15:04.520]  military attack even if the military says no it won't matter because a pre
[4:15:04.520 --> 4:15:10.320]  programmed war game system has been put into function and that attack profile
[4:15:10.320 --> 4:15:15.280]  they'll have hundreds of attack profiles put in for their robotic drone forces
[4:15:15.280 --> 4:15:21.960]  with entire factories and robotic armored reservations separate from human
[4:15:21.960 --> 4:15:26.080]  activity other than highly compartmentalized technicians that go in and
[4:15:26.080 --> 4:15:30.200]  service the overall system and then and then those compartmentalized even in
[4:15:30.200 --> 4:15:34.400]  NORAD and other areas won't see it because the overall attack plans which
[4:15:34.400 --> 4:15:39.000]  they'll have hundreds of will be pre-programmed in the name of simulations
[4:15:39.000 --> 4:15:43.800]  they will then just go green light with the real simulation and attack whoever
[4:15:43.800 --> 4:15:49.920]  they want and I see the main attack not being a biological one though the elite
[4:15:49.920 --> 4:15:53.240]  have shown the genetic engineering they may be reckless and do that because they
[4:15:53.240 --> 4:15:57.280]  know that can get out of hand and they might not have proper cures or could
[4:15:57.280 --> 4:16:01.320]  mutate the cleaner way to go and then the way I believe they're going to attack
[4:16:01.320 --> 4:16:08.400]  by the year 2020 is their go date is a drone robot fleet attack with aircraft
[4:16:08.400 --> 4:16:13.280]  dropping neutron bombs on every major city in town and I believe that is the
[4:16:13.280 --> 4:16:22.520]  main attack profile but again that's my own mass integration war game studying
[4:16:22.520 --> 4:16:26.120]  enemy operations and past operations that you know the same projection I was
[4:16:26.120 --> 4:16:30.720]  able to give pre-911 because I saw their preparation I knew their attack
[4:16:30.720 --> 4:16:35.720]  profile I integrated thousands of pieces of data into that prime projection I
[4:16:35.720 --> 4:16:40.120]  will tell you that the neutron bomb attack on every major city and they may
[4:16:40.120 --> 4:16:45.240]  not even drop them they may have robotic delivery trucks did you know deliver
[4:16:45.240 --> 4:16:48.440]  them into every city I mean I mean they've got this at every level I'm
[4:16:48.440 --> 4:16:52.800]  saying the neutron attack is what we are facing I'll guarantee you that's a
[4:16:52.800 --> 4:16:57.040]  battle plan being prepared and it's one of the major attack profiles that we are
[4:16:57.040 --> 4:17:02.280]  facing as a species now you can you can you can laugh at me all you want or you
[4:17:02.280 --> 4:17:07.320]  can decide to check out the information and fight against the enemy control
[4:17:07.320 --> 4:17:12.560]  freak bastards from hell now let's just take three final calls Jeff Russell and
[4:17:12.560 --> 4:17:15.840]  Carol my wife's gonna kill me I'm supposed to be home to help her with
[4:17:15.840 --> 4:17:21.760]  something Jeff and Oregon go ahead got three words for you project loopy yeah
[4:17:21.760 --> 4:17:26.640]  fake alien attack yes the fake rapture they could they could program it into
[4:17:26.640 --> 4:17:30.440]  anywhere in the world whatever predominant religious belief that's what
[4:17:30.440 --> 4:17:35.520]  you will see in the sky well they can also with these cross poisons they put
[4:17:35.520 --> 4:17:40.120]  in us then apply another poison only certain people will drop dead and so
[4:17:40.120 --> 4:17:43.440]  they've been prepared for that as well yeah I was reading about the Kim trail
[4:17:43.440 --> 4:17:48.400]  that would actually act like a movie screen for their satellite imaging your
[4:17:48.400 --> 4:17:53.160]  3d holographic they've been testing that you know oh yeah freaking ridiculous man
[4:17:53.160 --> 4:17:58.020]  playing god the new years anything else sir I wanted to give a shout out to
[4:17:58.020 --> 4:18:02.240]  Alex answering I'm here in Portland and he's the one who woke me up good going
[4:18:02.240 --> 4:18:07.280]  Alex on Oracle broadcasting outside the box yeah I just want to say this though
[4:18:07.280 --> 4:18:10.960]  he's a really nice guy and because people like him I'm nice I don't
[4:18:10.960 --> 4:18:18.560]  appreciate the if if I was in this for myself I would sue people like that but
[4:18:18.560 --> 4:18:22.640]  just because those delusional people make lies up about me doesn't then make it
[4:18:22.640 --> 4:18:28.280]  true and I mean just endless lies endless how I'm the bad guy yeah I mean
[4:18:28.280 --> 4:18:32.880]  I've done nothing I had some of those people accuse me of taking them off the
[4:18:32.880 --> 4:18:37.880]  air one day I mean it's insane lies and I just I don't deserve it and then I
[4:18:37.880 --> 4:18:41.960]  get a sponsor calling up going you know what you know what is this about them
[4:18:41.960 --> 4:18:46.960]  saying this and I didn't say something it's all crap man they all made up lies
[4:18:46.960 --> 4:18:50.160]  and somebody called in earlier about another talk show host another
[4:18:50.160 --> 4:18:53.920]  internet radio network you know about I'm gonna debate them or something and I
[4:18:53.920 --> 4:18:57.360]  didn't say that somebody called up all paranoid saying this person says you're
[4:18:57.360 --> 4:19:00.640]  attacking them and I said no I didn't attack them but ought to have him on as
[4:19:00.640 --> 4:19:03.720]  a guest sometime and then it turns into there's gonna be a big debate or you're
[4:19:03.720 --> 4:19:07.440]  afraid of the debate I'm like no I said I didn't say anything about you and we
[4:19:07.440 --> 4:19:10.680]  want to be friends no you don't want to be so just get the hell out of my way
[4:19:10.680 --> 4:19:14.520]  though enjoy your cancer viruses and just drink all your diet coke and you
[4:19:14.520 --> 4:19:17.920]  were the hell you want man but don't none of you will ever take away from the
[4:19:17.920 --> 4:19:21.200]  fact that I'm legitimate none of you'll ever take away the fact that I do love
[4:19:21.200 --> 4:19:25.480]  you and I do love humanity and I really am for real people can't deal with the
[4:19:25.480 --> 4:19:28.640]  fact that I snuck into Bohemian Grove they can't deal with the fact that I'm
[4:19:28.640 --> 4:19:31.560]  in some Hollywood movies they can't deal with the fact that I know Willie
[4:19:31.560 --> 4:19:35.520]  Nelson and and Charlie Sheen and all these other and Keanu Reeves all these
[4:19:35.520 --> 4:19:38.440]  people they can't deal with the fact that I've reached hundreds of millions of
[4:19:38.440 --> 4:19:41.800]  people they can't deal with the fact that I've made all these films they can't
[4:19:41.800 --> 4:19:45.320]  deal with the fact that every once in a while tell a story about you know being
[4:19:45.320 --> 4:19:48.160]  jumped by a bunch of people and kicking their ass they go you're a liar you're a
[4:19:48.160 --> 4:19:51.560]  wimp as if at a primitive level you know that I can't even have at the
[4:19:51.560 --> 4:19:56.840]  primitive level that I am a man and I fight back I've done everything real
[4:19:56.840 --> 4:20:01.600]  I'm legitimate it's the real deal and all the exploits all the things we've done
[4:20:01.600 --> 4:20:07.320]  is a testament to humanity and the power of humanity taking action and that's
[4:20:07.320 --> 4:20:11.000]  why the Cointel pro and the operatives and the disinformation people and all of
[4:20:11.000 --> 4:20:18.240]  them savagely attack me 24-7 everywhere because they can't stand it the
[4:20:18.240 --> 4:20:22.200]  government has to pull down the image of Alex Jones because it's an image that
[4:20:22.200 --> 4:20:25.680]  others can emulate and then make make even better and they could be leaders
[4:20:25.680 --> 4:20:30.720]  and dynamic and it's so sad because I've always wanted to work with people and be
[4:20:30.720 --> 4:20:35.040]  nice to people but I've learned 90% of the time when I've tried to reach out to
[4:20:35.040 --> 4:20:39.960]  other people to build them up they stabbed me in the back because they're
[4:20:39.960 --> 4:20:43.360]  not in this to fight the new world order they don't understand just how real it
[4:20:43.360 --> 4:20:47.800]  is and how it's affecting them where they do it's it's it it hasn't sunk into
[4:20:47.800 --> 4:20:50.920]  their subconscious they consciously know it but they don't subconsciously
[4:20:50.920 --> 4:20:54.880]  integrate it and realize we're all in this together in a red level crisis of
[4:20:54.880 --> 4:21:02.520]  humanity together and so I'm the big shot I'm the big name I'm the big guy in
[4:21:02.520 --> 4:21:08.320]  the in the Liberty Awakening movement worldwide and they can't stand it it is
[4:21:08.320 --> 4:21:14.520]  so upsetting to all these people so they make up lies they twist things they take
[4:21:14.520 --> 4:21:20.840]  5% truth 95% lies they take rumors they mix them with things that are true they
[4:21:20.840 --> 4:21:28.720]  you know just just just just do things you can't even imagine and most of it
[4:21:28.720 --> 4:21:30.960]  isn't because they're even government operatives government operatives always
[4:21:30.960 --> 4:21:35.400]  get the ball started rolling but it snowballs because they've been programmed
[4:21:35.400 --> 4:21:40.520]  by the society to be back stabbing hateful petty delusional people instead
[4:21:40.520 --> 4:21:43.760]  of really working instead of really fighting instead of being on a mission
[4:21:43.760 --> 4:21:49.000]  to reach people and then that brings in the success they think if they just all
[4:21:49.000 --> 4:21:51.520]  attack you and they'll do to each other they all attack each other they're
[4:21:51.520 --> 4:21:55.040]  always in fighting with each other they're always bringing up grand master
[4:21:55.040 --> 4:22:02.840]  plans and ideas and they're never implementing it and it's sad but at
[4:22:02.840 --> 4:22:06.960]  the end of the day I do what I do for my children and my family and people
[4:22:06.960 --> 4:22:12.160]  around me that I trust and I love and I do it knowing that humanity will mature
[4:22:12.160 --> 4:22:14.800]  and that we're going to a better place and that we don't have a choice we're
[4:22:14.800 --> 4:22:18.440]  fighting great evil but at this end of the year show it is very frustrating to
[4:22:18.440 --> 4:22:25.120]  me that that I turn the cheek over and over again you know on my myspace I see
[4:22:25.120 --> 4:22:28.560]  people come on and promote their their operations and I even tend to leave it
[4:22:28.560 --> 4:22:32.800]  there you know see them post and say oh thank you and say hi and I even happen
[4:22:32.800 --> 4:22:36.680]  to know that very person's talking crap about me and it's very painful and I
[4:22:36.680 --> 4:22:41.200]  try to be Christ like it's just million miles away from that but I try on my
[4:22:41.200 --> 4:22:44.480]  own feeble way I go I'm just gonna leave that I'm gonna let them go ahead and
[4:22:44.480 --> 4:22:47.880]  promote themselves even though they've persecuted me and born false witness
[4:22:47.880 --> 4:22:51.840]  hundreds of times I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead but but at the same
[4:22:51.840 --> 4:22:56.680]  time some of these groups are so dangerous some of these groups are so
[4:22:56.680 --> 4:23:01.180]  dangerous I mean I mean trying to send me to prison folks I mean stuff you can't
[4:23:01.180 --> 4:23:05.400]  imagine the wheel about on air some of the locals that I have to fully block
[4:23:05.400 --> 4:23:12.120]  them and fully so it's kind of a catch 22 but I don't want to turn into somebody
[4:23:12.120 --> 4:23:17.880]  who just goes out and and and crushes people you know anytime they do anything
[4:23:17.880 --> 4:23:23.800]  to me I tend to just kind of shields up break all contact say nothing give no
[4:23:23.800 --> 4:23:30.880]  response and hope that they fend off like sharks onto somebody else but but but
[4:23:30.880 --> 4:23:34.360]  I don't even do that overall it's the moral thing to do but the moral thing
[4:23:34.360 --> 4:23:39.160]  ends up helping you because then you don't waste your time spending your
[4:23:39.160 --> 4:23:43.960]  wheels in fighting and running around dealing with people you spend your time
[4:23:43.960 --> 4:23:48.720]  actually reaching out to others that do care and so that's what I'd say people
[4:23:48.720 --> 4:23:52.080]  trying to argue with you that go on YouTube and Google and say there's no
[4:23:52.080 --> 4:23:58.400]  new world order you're crazy you're a racist just ignore them folks they're
[4:23:58.400 --> 4:24:03.280]  operatives or they're of the same spirit you know being directed by the same
[4:24:03.280 --> 4:24:11.000]  system the same programming just ignore them reach out to those that care you
[4:24:11.000 --> 4:24:19.960]  know reach out to to to people that that do want to change things and also you
[4:24:19.960 --> 4:24:23.680]  know you don't even so much need to work with others at first you will find
[4:24:23.680 --> 4:24:26.040]  others you can work with later I mean you know people say well what kind of
[4:24:26.040 --> 4:24:29.080]  access TV showed I need to do well what kind of website I need to start what
[4:24:29.080 --> 4:24:32.760]  kind of community group I don't know I don't have all the answers go in
[4:24:32.760 --> 4:24:36.720]  different directions do different things you will reach others you will
[4:24:36.720 --> 4:24:45.560]  affect change you will change the world around you but you know here locally in
[4:24:45.560 --> 4:24:49.560]  Austin I I never went to a lot of events because I'm busy doing media I mean I
[4:24:49.560 --> 4:24:52.920]  can go speak to a crowd of 200 people or a thousand people or whatever or I can
[4:24:52.920 --> 4:24:57.280]  talk to millions I can go do other radio interviews I can I can write
[4:24:57.280 --> 4:25:03.280]  articles I know that's what's the more effective but I mean you go to a
[4:25:03.280 --> 4:25:06.880]  patriot meeting and but especially those that think their main line those
[4:25:06.880 --> 4:25:09.800]  they're trying to make themselves the leadership they'll just sit around
[4:25:09.800 --> 4:25:14.600]  talking crap about everybody and I hate being even sucked into that because you
[4:25:14.600 --> 4:25:19.760]  know I you know it's it and so it's like these communities of shared hate and so
[4:25:19.760 --> 4:25:24.600]  it's now like a religion to hate me I mean the vast majority of people love
[4:25:24.600 --> 4:25:28.040]  the show the information put up with my obnoxiousness they you know they've seen
[4:25:28.040 --> 4:25:32.520]  my predictions my kernels of knowledge my info you know they know it's valuable
[4:25:32.520 --> 4:25:37.560]  they have discernment they know it's for real but it is kind of weird and I know
[4:25:37.560 --> 4:25:42.480]  that's a mark of success to have an entire sub religion that's just about
[4:25:42.480 --> 4:25:48.640]  hating me and where everything you know it's like a dynamism you know around the
[4:25:48.640 --> 4:25:52.800]  fable the lie but I realize that's those people hating themselves it's a
[4:25:52.800 --> 4:25:58.360]  self-hate they don't want there to be a successful good pure image trying to be
[4:25:58.360 --> 4:26:03.720]  pure of someone actually affecting things having change in the world reaching
[4:26:03.720 --> 4:26:09.600]  out to people they don't want that they I'm gonna go to your calls three final
[4:26:09.600 --> 4:26:11.720]  calls Jeff Russell and Carol but I've got to say this I'm going to say this
[4:26:11.720 --> 4:26:16.600]  earlier in the show a caller called and said America Freedom to Fascism is
[4:26:16.600 --> 4:26:21.720]  airing on the official PBS channel in Denver and I said that is super news and
[4:26:21.720 --> 4:26:24.600]  I said give out their call letters people can find out what it's on that's
[4:26:24.600 --> 4:26:28.640]  three times give that out again give that out again I mean I was buoyed by
[4:26:28.640 --> 4:26:34.760]  that and I but I know that eighty percent of people on the quote patriot
[4:26:34.760 --> 4:26:38.600]  movement are still they're awake to the new order but they're diseased still by
[4:26:38.600 --> 4:26:41.760]  the world the flesh itself they go all that movies not that good that guy's a
[4:26:41.760 --> 4:26:45.880]  Jew or and I mean 80% wouldn't say that but of the 80% different percentage of
[4:26:45.880 --> 4:26:49.720]  savory things are at movies not that good or well now he's dead so most folks
[4:26:49.720 --> 4:26:54.480]  aren't as jealous of him so you know maybe 50% would attack Russo because
[4:26:54.480 --> 4:26:58.000]  because again that's the weird instinct they've taught us all to fight with each
[4:26:58.000 --> 4:27:02.760]  other I instantly was oh how wonderful tell folks how they can listen oh good
[4:27:02.760 --> 4:27:07.040]  and I realized that there'll be a lot of people though in that Arizona PBS they
[4:27:07.040 --> 4:27:09.880]  won't realize that some directors probably gonna lose their job over it
[4:27:09.880 --> 4:27:15.080]  there's probably been internal fights over it that that that this is a real
[4:27:15.080 --> 4:27:20.000]  rebellion this is people in the system really trying to to fight for America in
[4:27:20.000 --> 4:27:25.280]  liberty and then risking their job and and and going to such extremes to get
[4:27:25.280 --> 4:27:30.560]  it out no people will just not be able to believe that we were having a
[4:27:30.560 --> 4:27:35.000]  success as the awakening movement taking the culture back that they'll just
[4:27:35.000 --> 4:27:40.200]  say ah that's cuz he's a Jew or something like that you know that's all
[4:27:40.200 --> 4:27:43.840]  the reason they let that on there because it's disinfo or they'd say
[4:27:43.840 --> 4:27:51.360]  something else because they don't want to actually beat the New World Order at a
[4:27:51.360 --> 4:27:55.080]  conscious and subconscious level they don't want to act like winners they
[4:27:55.080 --> 4:28:00.120]  don't want to say hey we could fix this or hey we could make this better you
[4:28:00.120 --> 4:28:03.600]  know they just want to say they just want to say oh it's all bad there's
[4:28:03.600 --> 4:28:08.080]  nothing you can do I screw it and the feds play on that I mean we have to be
[4:28:08.080 --> 4:28:14.200]  ready to take over the system have a renaissance we have to speak to the elite
[4:28:14.200 --> 4:28:21.080]  we have to speak to the establishment we have to reach out to people we have to
[4:28:21.080 --> 4:28:24.800]  ask people in the establishment do you really want to be part of this do you
[4:28:24.800 --> 4:28:28.240]  do you really want to kill the majority of the public I mean do you really want
[4:28:28.240 --> 4:28:30.960]  to have genetic engineering on wild I mean you really want to even endanger
[4:28:30.960 --> 4:28:35.480]  yourselves because it's very alluring to those that are in darkness who aren't
[4:28:35.480 --> 4:28:38.560]  completely turned over to it a lot of them were just seduced through
[4:28:38.560 --> 4:28:42.120]  competition or whatever and got deep into it now are scared that they can come
[4:28:42.120 --> 4:28:46.080]  out that they can join us that we can defeat the New World Order and then
[4:28:46.080 --> 4:28:48.800]  most people are just compartmentalized and bind the propaganda now their
[4:28:48.800 --> 4:28:52.200]  blinders are coming off and our information is becoming you know very
[4:28:52.200 --> 4:28:57.320]  mainstream and as cutting edge as it gets this isn't some niche or even movement
[4:28:57.320 --> 4:29:01.120]  this is just humans saying wow what's going on on this planet wow there's this
[4:29:01.120 --> 4:29:05.960]  whole universe around us and we want to be in fellowship together like-minded
[4:29:05.960 --> 4:29:09.120]  people that want liberty the enemy then goes well you're black or you're white
[4:29:09.120 --> 4:29:12.360]  or you're Mexican or you're Catholic or you're Protestant or you're Jewish or
[4:29:12.360 --> 4:29:15.880]  you're German or you're Chinese you can't be part of the group you can't be
[4:29:15.880 --> 4:29:18.320]  part of the group only we're part of the group or well I don't totally agree
[4:29:18.320 --> 4:29:24.040]  with everything he says we have to get past that and come together against
[4:29:24.040 --> 4:29:28.840]  anything that's dehumanizing you know it doesn't matter if it's black people
[4:29:28.840 --> 4:29:34.600]  Jews Easter bunnies Chewbacobras that run the New World Order we say we're
[4:29:34.600 --> 4:29:37.360]  against unelected regional government taking control of our local
[4:29:37.360 --> 4:29:41.960]  governments and taking the power of the people away you say that to people and
[4:29:41.960 --> 4:29:46.080]  99.9% are going to say absolutely no matter what color they are what
[4:29:46.080 --> 4:29:49.040]  religion they are I want local government control I don't want an
[4:29:49.040 --> 4:29:52.400]  unelected regional corporate controlled thing taking my freedom we're against
[4:29:52.400 --> 4:29:57.800]  a 21 or I don't want unelected international bodies setting up deals
[4:29:57.800 --> 4:30:02.280]  to use US troops on the streets of America as part of a NAFTA SPP deal and
[4:30:02.280 --> 4:30:05.400]  now Congress is saying hey you're gonna use military on the streets we didn't
[4:30:05.400 --> 4:30:11.840]  approve that see instead of the oh you're for the Zionist huh you didn't say it
[4:30:11.840 --> 4:30:16.480]  was Zionist hey I'm just saying I want to work with everybody and be friendly
[4:30:16.480 --> 4:30:21.280]  and I just want to say we don't want troops on the streets and violence
[4:30:21.280 --> 4:30:24.760]  and positive commentators and Congress didn't approve it don't we all agree
[4:30:24.760 --> 4:30:27.800]  that's a bad thing don't we all agree that's tyranny yeah we all agree we all
[4:30:27.800 --> 4:30:33.960]  agree well then a fed jumps up Jews or Catholics he's a Catholic he's one of
[4:30:33.960 --> 4:30:37.680]  them he works for the black pope then you find out the guy saying that actually
[4:30:37.680 --> 4:30:41.800]  isn't Israeli operative you know and then I'm not gonna go hate and only
[4:30:41.800 --> 4:30:46.200]  attack on Israel just because I've got Mossad after me I mean look at who's
[4:30:46.200 --> 4:30:49.840]  being attacked folks look at who they're after look at who they're going after

[4:31:35.680 --> 4:31:40.000]  in as much as I like to I'm running the magazine down here but I mean I you've
[4:31:40.000 --> 4:31:43.360]  affected a lot of the change this year I think I've done it as well with the
[4:31:43.360 --> 4:31:48.040]  magazine this year oh it's been a great year I agree with you earlier and I'm
[4:31:48.040 --> 4:31:53.560]  not I'm as weary as of oh nine as you are but I think oh no they didn't agree
[4:31:53.560 --> 4:32:01.080]  here and man keep it up I just want to have a couple comments you know the
[4:32:01.080 --> 4:32:06.040]  everything is going digital Alex with the with the TV series and I guess
[4:32:06.040 --> 4:32:11.440]  January and I'm wondering you know it's up is this whole everything going
[4:32:11.440 --> 4:32:16.360]  digital does it have any effect with the emergency alert system yes the EIS in
[4:32:16.360 --> 4:32:23.640]  96 takes over all cable TV radio unless it's micros and with the digital what
[4:32:23.640 --> 4:32:28.480]  that does is it makes a lot of AM and FM go out of business because a lot of
[4:32:28.480 --> 4:32:32.000]  these stations are barely hanging on you know the thousands of mom and pops and
[4:32:32.000 --> 4:32:37.480]  they can't afford a you know new digital transmitter or the new permitting from
[4:32:37.480 --> 4:32:41.600]  the FCC you know for a say an FM station that might cost a half a million bucks
[4:32:41.600 --> 4:32:46.000]  million bucks and so it's a way to shut them down also it's better for the
[4:32:46.000 --> 4:32:50.040]  mind control patterns they flicker everything they do and this is my
[4:32:50.040 --> 4:32:54.480]  control hold on let me tell folks this is my control to right here we're going
[4:32:54.480 --> 4:32:57.040]  to run more slower images in the background this is kind of a news
[4:32:57.040 --> 4:33:03.200]  background thing we do and the reason it's mind control is it gives more
[4:33:03.200 --> 4:33:08.640]  action on the screen and so it makes people to be able to take in multiple
[4:33:08.640 --> 4:33:12.480]  feeds of information it makes you switch into a subconscious mode now this
[4:33:12.480 --> 4:33:16.840]  doesn't do it fully one thing in the background really just keeps people's
[4:33:16.840 --> 4:33:20.400]  interest but when they put two or three screens in the background would say
[4:33:20.400 --> 4:33:25.840]  bullfighting going on and a plane crashing and people have football game
[4:33:25.840 --> 4:33:29.560]  behind me and then scrolling in front of me and then a blue mist up here with an
[4:33:29.560 --> 4:33:35.240]  American flag I mean this is taught in school all of and in in in RTF in the
[4:33:35.240 --> 4:33:40.760]  higher degrees this all to where the mind can't watch that it's like watching
[4:33:40.760 --> 4:33:44.880]  10 TV sets so you switch into subconscious mode and now all of it there
[4:33:44.880 --> 4:33:49.480]  we go we got a little bit more of that going on all of it then bombards and so
[4:33:49.480 --> 4:33:54.200]  now your rational mind can't analyze it to go straight through so I've been
[4:33:54.200 --> 4:33:57.800]  meaning to go with the more newsy backgrounds this is just a news feed we
[4:33:57.800 --> 4:34:00.840]  have we're gonna get rid of this soon we'll bring it back from time to time
[4:34:00.840 --> 4:34:06.920]  but that is a form of mind control but but but again it's only meant by the
[4:34:06.920 --> 4:34:12.200]  establishment to keep attention and then divert your conscious mind so then
[4:34:12.200 --> 4:34:18.160]  verbally with the semantics they put in the dis info and then that goes into
[4:34:18.160 --> 4:34:21.880]  your subconscious rather we are putting out the truth with this in the
[4:34:21.880 --> 4:34:26.640]  background but it is borderline unethical and so that's why I'm announcing
[4:34:26.640 --> 4:34:30.880]  in here and letting folks know about it well and the second point I wanted to
[4:34:30.880 --> 4:34:35.360]  make is I mean I've heard a lot of I have a lot of friends that have you know
[4:34:35.360 --> 4:34:38.920]  thought of and I haven't heard you speak to this in all this year but I mean I
[4:34:38.920 --> 4:34:42.680]  will go ahead and mention it on your show here but I mean I've heard some
[4:34:42.680 --> 4:34:48.000]  people mention oh Barack Hussein Obama he's the Antichrist and all of this you
[4:34:48.000 --> 4:34:52.200]  know and and oh and the way he people worship them newsweek articles and all
[4:34:52.200 --> 4:34:56.800]  of this the savior of the world and all of this and I don't know if that's true
[4:34:56.800 --> 4:35:02.520]  but I did notice that Barack Hussein Obama has 18 letters in it you divide
[4:35:02.520 --> 4:35:07.520]  that by three at six yeah three six six six I don't know I'm just speculating
[4:35:07.520 --> 4:35:11.120]  there but I'm just going that out there at you hey Russell fire out your website
[4:35:11.120 --> 4:35:16.640]  for folks yeah it's weird magazine calm I need to update that side ruling folks
[4:35:16.640 --> 4:35:20.800]  can get in touch with us at my space that seems to be the the most of the
[4:35:20.800 --> 4:35:24.320]  activities on the myspace.com forward slash weird magazine all right buddy
[4:35:24.320 --> 4:35:28.120]  good to hear from you have a great year I want to take one final call from Carol
[4:35:28.120 --> 4:35:35.160]  in Montana here in just a moment but I was just thinking here I was just
[4:35:35.160 --> 4:35:40.360]  thinking about you know the whole Antichrist thing with Barack Obama there
[4:35:40.360 --> 4:35:45.440]  are many Antichrist the Bible says and whether you believe the Bible or not I
[4:35:45.440 --> 4:35:48.960]  mean they really did you know two thousand years ago revelations about a
[4:35:48.960 --> 4:35:53.880]  mark in the hand or the forehead to buy and sell and big metal machines dropping
[4:35:53.880 --> 4:35:59.280]  firebombs out this and explosions the size of mountains and world leaders and
[4:35:59.280 --> 4:36:02.840]  ten kingdoms and then you see the club of Rome in the UN saying we'll be under
[4:36:02.840 --> 4:36:07.000]  ten world kingdoms they use the word kingdom and you'll have a mark and they
[4:36:07.000 --> 4:36:11.080]  call it digital angel and and people say well that's predictive programming you
[4:36:11.080 --> 4:36:13.960]  know they they they planted that two thousand years ago and now they're
[4:36:13.960 --> 4:36:19.240]  doing it whatever it okay I mean the thing is it's heavy duty folks I mean it
[4:36:19.240 --> 4:36:24.280]  is heavy duty and I've never seen an American president especially while
[4:36:24.280 --> 4:36:27.920]  they're still alive even Roosevelt if he was dead or Kennedy after they were
[4:36:27.920 --> 4:36:32.920]  dead it wasn't this endless the one the Savior the King the God the you know
[4:36:32.920 --> 4:36:35.320]  toward no matter what happens with the economy it doesn't matter just do what
[4:36:35.320 --> 4:36:38.360]  he says and he'll fix it they're certainly setting him up now they may
[4:36:38.360 --> 4:36:41.720]  destroy him down the line but I've never seen something like this this is
[4:36:41.720 --> 4:36:53.080]  it larian and so Barack Obama it is it is it is bad news written all over that
[4:36:53.080 --> 4:36:56.720]  guy and he's betraying the people that voted for him at every front they just
[4:36:56.720 --> 4:37:01.280]  still don't care they go I don't care I love him oh I don't care go ahead and
[4:37:01.280 --> 4:37:04.600]  expand after and get go ahead and take the guns go ahead and attack more
[4:37:04.600 --> 4:37:10.560]  nations go ahead and spy on me he's black it's a change it's a change and
[4:37:10.560 --> 4:37:16.120]  it's sick I know that they're like what are you for a McCain no they owned them
[4:37:16.120 --> 4:37:21.600]  both don't you understand that it's like a Don King fight Carol in Montana last
[4:37:21.600 --> 4:37:31.920]  caller of 2008 all right for Montana hell yeah hey Alex I gotta comment you on
[4:37:31.920 --> 4:37:35.240]  helping all of us people out there I don't know what in the world we would do
[4:37:35.240 --> 4:37:38.960]  without a person like you don't you let that trash get you down I don't even
[4:37:38.960 --> 4:37:42.160]  bother with trash I don't waste my time talking about him I don't waste my
[4:37:42.160 --> 4:37:47.000]  breath talking back to him blow it off we know good from bad don't let him get
[4:37:47.000 --> 4:37:51.240]  you down like my problem is this hold on it doesn't get me down when I'm
[4:37:51.240 --> 4:37:57.640]  attacked for myself you know my ego is there and I and it's a propulsion system
[4:37:57.640 --> 4:38:01.000]  but it's a very small part of my propulsion system now my overall love
[4:38:01.000 --> 4:38:06.200]  of humanity the species my love affair with creativity my love affair with
[4:38:06.200 --> 4:38:10.720]  beauty of all forms and in just basic human decency and honor in our
[4:38:10.720 --> 4:38:14.680]  interesting history and what's coming in the future and my love of my children
[4:38:14.680 --> 4:38:19.560]  wanting them to have a better future that is what drives me but then I'm
[4:38:19.560 --> 4:38:25.640]  sad for people that I can't work with I'm sad for people that have tried to
[4:38:25.640 --> 4:38:29.000]  destroy me and tried to bring me down whether they're agents or not I'm sad
[4:38:29.000 --> 4:38:34.280]  that that that they're mentally ill because most of them believe a false
[4:38:34.280 --> 4:38:38.240]  little fake thing they make up you know that's why their failures that's why
[4:38:38.240 --> 4:38:41.840]  they're unhappy because they're not into the real world they're into a delusion
[4:38:41.840 --> 4:38:47.840]  you know kind of a child and dress up you know who's fault is posing and so
[4:38:47.840 --> 4:38:52.400]  that's why I'm sad go ahead well you're definitely a person above me because
[4:38:52.400 --> 4:38:56.200]  I'm not sad over trash I'm done with trash there's too much evil in this
[4:38:56.200 --> 4:39:00.000]  earth right now for the good to eat and try to survive and and I mean you are
[4:39:00.000 --> 4:39:05.000]  over and above me well over and above me my problem is this Alex and this is
[4:39:05.000 --> 4:39:09.280]  really sincere the pop total population of the state of Montana maybe equals a
[4:39:09.280 --> 4:39:13.120]  million people I believe that they are up here just Kenny pig in the hell out of
[4:39:13.120 --> 4:39:17.160]  it and the reason I say this isn't the last it started last February where our
[4:39:17.160 --> 4:39:21.400]  skies occasionally would turn purple and we know that that is the harp towers
[4:39:21.400 --> 4:39:24.560]  and they were turning them on and off and playing all the games I have a farm in
[4:39:24.560 --> 4:39:28.040]  a ranch up here and I have cows that were literally going lethargic on me
[4:39:28.040 --> 4:39:31.960]  going off of feed for two and three days I'll blow that you could normally not
[4:39:31.960 --> 4:39:35.600]  even walk up to but when those towers are on hot and heavy you can walk up to
[4:39:35.600 --> 4:39:38.600]  them and you could see in his highs that he wants to move and he wants to run
[4:39:38.600 --> 4:39:44.160]  and he can't no I know I'm no expanding on that all over the nation they're
[4:39:44.160 --> 4:39:48.600]  fluoridating small towns and then everybody's cows and horses die
[4:39:48.600 --> 4:39:51.880]  because they're drinking so much water and then they take them into the state
[4:39:51.880 --> 4:39:55.400]  vets and they go yeah fluoride poisoning you know and they don't and the
[4:39:55.400 --> 4:39:58.400]  government just laughs and go that's right keep drinking it you sons of
[4:39:58.400 --> 4:40:03.160]  bitches just we're gonna murder your ass we're gonna murder your ass I mean we
[4:40:03.160 --> 4:40:08.880]  just got murdering psychos in control I mean I want to stop these bastards I'm
[4:40:08.880 --> 4:40:15.200]  sorry what if you're what you're really worked up today just makes me sick man

[4:40:19.960 --> 4:40:25.320]  government oh god I mean it's just sick okay here's here's the here's the deal
[4:40:25.320 --> 4:40:28.680]  this is I mean we're talking Montana we're talking ranches we're talking
[4:40:28.680 --> 4:40:33.560]  well water okay we're also talking now cable TV we have a high antenna out on
[4:40:33.560 --> 4:40:38.200]  the outside of our hop okay they hit these hot towers our skies are all
[4:40:38.200 --> 4:40:42.200]  purple and black I mean this has been like this for the last two months every
[4:40:42.200 --> 4:40:45.640]  single day we have I call it the piss boy spraying the chemicals over the top
[4:40:45.640 --> 4:40:50.560]  of us one has been on us all year long and we get to and then on Friday we get
[4:40:50.560 --> 4:40:53.640]  three and four of them but they just literally shut our sky off our great
[4:40:53.640 --> 4:40:57.160]  governor who runs around want to be movie star won't do a damn thing about
[4:40:57.160 --> 4:41:01.840]  just the people of this whole area here I live by the second largest airport
[4:41:01.840 --> 4:41:05.440]  close to the second largest airport in the state of Montana and you cannot
[4:41:05.440 --> 4:41:08.680]  even begin to believe what's going on right now the skies are purple when they
[4:41:08.680 --> 4:41:13.200]  do the purple skies all of a sudden we get all the winds and all the storms and
[4:41:13.200 --> 4:41:16.320]  they take them from east to west and then they'll turn around this isn't a
[4:41:16.320 --> 4:41:20.080]  valley and they'll take them from north to south this is another doing they're
[4:41:20.080 --> 4:41:24.560]  doing they're doing weather modification they're doing barium salts aluminum
[4:41:24.560 --> 4:41:29.120]  sprays other spring biologicals and now the guy and listen I appreciate your
[4:41:29.120 --> 4:41:34.720]  call good good good last call the year carol from Montana they have the high
[4:41:34.720 --> 4:41:37.720]  altitude you know aerosol spraying programs with all the Department of
[4:41:37.720 --> 4:41:41.480]  Energy and Department of Agriculture and they admit that they're manipulating the
[4:41:41.480 --> 4:41:46.280]  weather and and and all these years and then they show satellite photos of how
[4:41:46.280 --> 4:41:51.000]  they were spraying off California and they put it in children's textbooks now
[4:41:51.000 --> 4:41:54.600]  in the high school textbooks they have multiple versions the feds put out you
[4:41:54.600 --> 4:41:58.400]  know the federal approved say we're spraying the skies to keep the earth
[4:41:58.400 --> 4:42:03.320]  safe from global warming and then you you call the FAA and they go you're a
[4:42:03.320 --> 4:42:06.280]  conspiracy theorist that doesn't exist you're like I have a government text
[4:42:06.280 --> 4:42:09.760]  book says you're doing and I have all these universities they just go we're
[4:42:09.760 --> 4:42:14.200]  not you're crazy and we go but okay well we have hundreds of newspapers saying
[4:42:14.200 --> 4:42:19.440]  that you set up a world government that it's good and you know and they go no
[4:42:19.440 --> 4:42:22.760]  that that isn't in there and that young man we had on a few days ago it's in
[4:42:22.760 --> 4:42:25.080]  this textbook world government new world order is good
[4:42:25.080 --> 4:42:27.600]  chapters called new world order and he wouldn't complain they said doesn't say
[4:42:27.600 --> 4:42:33.040]  that and he said he said yeah it says it right here and they go no I mean so it's
[4:42:33.040 --> 4:42:36.960]  like it's like zombies man it's like they're all mentally ill going around
[4:42:36.960 --> 4:42:41.760]  saying we're not seeing this happening and you know the foreign troops they've
[4:42:41.760 --> 4:42:44.360]  announced they're gonna use foreign troops in America it's all it's in major
[4:42:44.360 --> 4:42:48.960]  newspapers and then you say you don't want it and they say it doesn't exist in
[4:42:48.960 --> 4:42:55.000]  fact I've got an article right here military backpedals on troops in

[4:43:02.000 --> 4:43:09.440]  Reinhart junior recently told a press conference and it links to his press
[4:43:09.440 --> 4:43:12.800]  conference and he goes well the troops are gonna be on the streets but only to
[4:43:12.800 --> 4:43:16.560]  help you and yes they're here in case there's a chemical or bio attack and
[4:43:16.560 --> 4:43:19.840]  don't worry only the National Guard will do law enforcement but they're
[4:43:19.840 --> 4:43:24.000]  absorbing the National Guard under a federal so say he's running a psi op
[4:43:24.000 --> 4:43:27.840]  it's all about deception and they give each other pats on the backs great job
[4:43:27.840 --> 4:43:31.720]  lying to the enemy general good we're bringing them down God y'all to see my

[4:50:11.600 --> 4:50:15.480]  of Helena what's on the Arkansas I've been in this capacity since January the
[4:50:15.480 --> 4:50:22.000]  first of 2006 what led us to having this curfew or saturation zones in our
[4:50:22.000 --> 4:50:28.480]  community chiefly was this ten block area involves and I guess I can't hear
[4:50:28.480 --> 4:50:33.480]  anymore I can't hear anymore look your bosses shipped in the narcotics at huge
[4:50:33.480 --> 4:50:37.600]  black market to make huge profits knowing it would bring down society just
[4:50:37.600 --> 4:50:41.280]  like the British shipped opium into China to corrupt the police create massive
[4:50:41.280 --> 4:50:46.320]  crime waves you got to legalize the stuff dumbass that's why the bigger the
[4:50:46.320 --> 4:50:50.600]  drug war gets the more drugs we have and things fall apart do you get me you

[4:51:16.840 --> 4:51:22.240]  area involves and I guess the best way to describe some bad guys who didn't
[4:51:22.240 --> 4:51:25.120]  necessarily live there but they knew it was tough area and they were coming over
[4:51:25.120 --> 4:51:30.160]  there more or less it seemed as though they were trying to claim territory and
[4:51:30.160 --> 4:51:34.160]  this is an interview with him back peddling I want to the point is just
[4:51:34.160 --> 4:51:39.000]  just Google 24 hour curfew I don't have time here to go through all these clips

[4:51:42.160 --> 4:51:45.200]  the area and then it went city-wide and then two other towns did it and it's all
