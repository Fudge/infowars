[00:00.000 --> 00:26.780]  We are 54 days out from the inauguration of President-elect Donald J. Trump.
[00:26.780 --> 00:33.480]  From the moment we learned that he had won in the middle of the night on November 9th
[00:33.480 --> 00:38.120]  in the early morning hours, I knew that they would try to overthrow his election.
[00:38.120 --> 00:39.120]  They're going to try to impeach him.
[00:39.120 --> 00:40.120]  They're going to try to dig up dirt.
[00:40.120 --> 00:45.080]  They're going to try to kill Donald Trump because Donald Trump is a nationalist.
[00:45.080 --> 00:47.560]  Donald Trump is an anti-globalist.
[00:47.560 --> 00:52.360]  Now the new Thoros push is to say he's betraying people when there's not any real evidence
[00:52.360 --> 00:53.760]  of that.
[00:53.760 --> 00:57.840]  The real proof will be when the rubber meets the road coming up January 20th when he enters
[00:57.840 --> 01:03.040]  office to see what he actually starts doing, securing our borders, cutting taxes, going
[01:03.040 --> 01:09.760]  after ISIS, things like that, setting up fairer trade deals.
[01:09.760 --> 01:14.840]  We have massive leverage because all these deals are one-sided via globalism to deindustrialize
[01:14.840 --> 01:15.840]  us.
[01:15.840 --> 01:16.840]  That's the admitted plan.
[01:16.840 --> 01:20.040]  So he's got such an enemy force of raid against him.
[01:20.040 --> 01:24.040]  Hillary, who said she would accept the results, has now come out and joined the recount with
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.040]  Jill Stein.
[01:25.040 --> 01:30.520]  He's got such a force of raid against him, I'm fully backing him until he gets into
[01:30.520 --> 01:31.520]  the office.
[01:31.520 --> 01:33.680]  Then, if things go sideways, I have nothing but integrity.
[01:33.680 --> 01:39.520]  I will, sadly, be very painful, start exposing what's going on, but that's cart before the
[01:39.520 --> 01:40.520]  horse.
[01:40.520 --> 01:43.640]  Here's what we know, and there's so much today we're going to cover.
[01:43.640 --> 01:45.640]  This is probably one of the most important broadcasts ever.
[01:45.640 --> 01:53.320]  I tend to say that more and more because there's a quickening and acceleration happening.
[01:53.320 --> 01:59.280]  Jill Stein is calling for a recount in five states that are all battlegrounds Donald Trump
[01:59.280 --> 02:00.280]  won.
[02:00.280 --> 02:02.800]  That's completely transparent.
[02:02.800 --> 02:07.360]  Bev Harris and other top election fraud experts who are bipartisan, and she's a liberal.
[02:07.360 --> 02:08.920]  Most are team are liberals, but they're real liberals.
[02:08.920 --> 02:11.760]  They just go where the facts are.
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.280]  They said all the evidence is showing fraud against Trump across the country, but his
[02:16.280 --> 02:19.560]  landslide was so big, he won.
[02:19.560 --> 02:22.520]  She's later exposed that Al Gore was robbed, and you know what, I didn't like Al Gore,
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.040]  but I went with that because the evidence was there, I covered it.
[02:26.040 --> 02:27.480]  Al Gore got robbed.
[02:27.480 --> 02:30.320]  I don't know who'd be worse though, him or Bush.
[02:30.320 --> 02:33.560]  The point is, the facts and the facts, they tried to steal it from Trump.
[02:33.560 --> 02:37.000]  Now, Trump doesn't want to sound like he's a sore winner and come out and say that, but
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.040]  I said weeks ago, he better do it because they're blaming him when she's only doing,
[02:42.040 --> 02:44.640]  he called it a scam to raise money, and that's part of it.
[02:44.640 --> 02:50.760]  No, it's a scam from Democratic Party donors to make Trump look illegitimate to cause a
[02:50.760 --> 02:54.240]  civil war in this country, and I said that last week.
[02:54.240 --> 02:59.280]  I said that Monday and Tuesday before I went to Thanksgiving, and now Fox News is saying
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.280]  that.
[03:00.280 --> 03:04.240]  And again, I just, I make that point because we're the trailblazers here, we'll say things
[03:04.240 --> 03:10.560]  that are obvious before other people will, because they want to go along with the establishment
[03:10.560 --> 03:11.560]  narrative.
[03:11.560 --> 03:12.560]  They think that's how they get ahead.
[03:12.560 --> 03:18.480]  Now, that said, Roger Stone's going to be popping in in the second hour, and I'm not
[03:18.480 --> 03:21.840]  going to get into all the inside baseball, but believe me, it's very interesting.
[03:21.840 --> 03:26.880]  I'll just leave it at that, but somebody has spent quite a bit of time with El Presidente.
[03:26.880 --> 03:30.840]  But we're going to get into the recount, Mitt Romney, what's really going on.
[03:30.840 --> 03:33.720]  It just, I've talked to him hours the last few days.
[03:33.720 --> 03:35.840]  This is going to be important in the second hour.
[03:35.840 --> 03:45.400]  Former head of Trump's campaign, kind of that wild card that Trump keeps under the table.
[03:45.400 --> 03:47.080]  Pun intended.
[03:47.080 --> 03:51.200]  Now that said, quite frankly, all that news pales with what I'm going to come back with
[03:51.200 --> 03:53.080]  on the other side.
[03:53.080 --> 03:59.040]  We're one of the first groups in the WikiLeaks back in early November, the first few days
[03:59.040 --> 04:05.440]  of November to expose the Satanism and the occult and the code words for pedophilia.
[04:05.440 --> 04:08.440]  These are admitted law enforcement code words that were being used in the emails.
[04:08.440 --> 04:10.760]  Did people accidentally use these?
[04:10.760 --> 04:14.200]  Did somebody in the administration set folks up and say, use these code words for something
[04:14.200 --> 04:15.200]  else?
[04:15.200 --> 04:16.200]  They're talking about something else.
[04:16.200 --> 04:17.200]  I mean, that might be it.
[04:17.200 --> 04:22.480]  I'm not making excuses for it, but this is a real radio broadcast and over 230 affiliates,
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.440]  way bigger than the BBC online, according to Quantcast and other major rating services.
[04:27.440 --> 04:30.800]  I'm just not going to go on the air like some reddit poster can do.
[04:30.800 --> 04:35.360]  I'm not bashing reddit posters, but and just say this person is a pedophile or this person
[04:35.360 --> 04:36.360]  rapes children.
[04:36.360 --> 04:41.720]  So I've seen this criticism that we're not covering pizza gate enough, even though we
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.120]  covered it every day, but that's how little people on the internet just feel big.
[04:46.120 --> 04:48.800]  They say, Joel's never exposed the Federal Reserve's private.
[04:48.800 --> 04:51.960]  Now I'll say this, I went back and looked at it more because it's so sickening.
[04:51.960 --> 04:55.680]  I don't like to even hard to look into it and I've been busy with other big news, but
[04:55.680 --> 04:59.240]  it is big and we got big breaking news on pizza gates and stay with us.
[04:59.240 --> 05:03.680]  More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research into what has been
[05:03.680 --> 05:05.680]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[05:05.680 --> 05:10.360]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate
[05:10.360 --> 05:16.000]  IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride,
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.720]  the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[05:18.720 --> 05:22.400]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[05:22.400 --> 05:26.920]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[05:26.920 --> 05:29.360]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[05:29.360 --> 05:34.840]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[05:34.840 --> 05:40.600]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[05:40.600 --> 05:42.240]  ever concerning iodine.
[05:42.240 --> 05:44.160]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[05:44.160 --> 05:48.440]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[05:48.440 --> 05:50.680]  any optimum health regimen.

[06:02.040 --> 06:31.040]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:33.040 --> 06:40.120]  Hard to believe we're about to enter the final month of 2016, and old November is long in
[06:40.120 --> 06:41.120]  the tooth.
[06:41.120 --> 06:44.280]  It is the 27th day of November, 2016.
[06:44.280 --> 06:46.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.640]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday edition.
[06:48.640 --> 06:54.080]  I'll be back tomorrow, or dwelling, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time with the week
[06:54.080 --> 06:55.080]  day broadcast.
[06:55.080 --> 06:57.120]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern.
[06:57.120 --> 07:02.320]  You can find the free apps with video feeds and more at infowars.com forward slash app.
[07:02.320 --> 07:06.840]  We also have a paid app for exclusive videos, commentary, analysis, and more.

[07:12.480 --> 07:16.880]  We also have a six, seven-year-old iPhone app that's still super popular, over two-and-a-half
[07:16.880 --> 07:20.680]  million downloads that just has a news feed and audio of the show.
[07:20.680 --> 07:22.720]  It's an oldie but a goodie and very popular.
[07:22.720 --> 07:26.160]  That's at infowars.com forward slash show.
[07:26.160 --> 07:29.000]  You'll find the free video feeds, audio feeds, and more.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.760]  That way, if you're listening to us on a local AM or FM station in your area, don't just
[07:32.760 --> 07:36.800]  spread the word to locals, which is very important in this fight against the globalist, but also
[07:36.800 --> 07:40.600]  call your friends, your neighbors, your family, people in other cities, other states, and
[07:40.600 --> 07:43.200]  say, listen to infowars.com.
[07:43.200 --> 07:48.200]  It's got Hillary and the globalist and the entire establishment hopping mad against it.
[07:48.200 --> 07:56.320]  Find out why they're trying to openly censor it at infowars.com forward slash show.
[07:56.320 --> 07:58.320]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[07:58.320 --> 07:59.320]  There is a lot.
[07:59.320 --> 08:04.720]  We have the Democrats organized with Hillary trying to overturn the election of Donald J.
[08:04.720 --> 08:05.720]  Trump.
[08:05.720 --> 08:10.080]  I don't like to say, see, I told you so, but when I left Tuesday at the end of the show,
[08:10.080 --> 08:12.440]  I said repeatedly, this is real.
[08:12.440 --> 08:13.960]  This is a real threat.
[08:13.960 --> 08:15.160]  The Democrats are behind it.
[08:15.160 --> 08:19.320]  Ford Soros is behind it, they're going to try to overthrow the electors.
[08:19.320 --> 08:24.760]  We won't know till December 19th or the 20th if they're able to do it.
[08:24.760 --> 08:30.640]  And the electors who represent the voters of those states and who go then to vote in
[08:30.640 --> 08:37.120]  the electoral college, they are being death-threaded and you think juries in gangster trials get
[08:37.120 --> 08:38.120]  messed with.
[08:38.120 --> 08:41.160]  They are getting jacked with just huge.
[08:41.160 --> 08:44.960]  I've got mainstream news reporting this all over the country.
[08:44.960 --> 08:47.000]  So that's happening.
[08:47.000 --> 08:54.080]  So you think it's Byzantine with the primaries and the delegates and superdelegates in both
[08:54.080 --> 08:55.080]  parties.
[08:55.080 --> 08:59.320]  You think those rules are twisted like a barrel of snakes.
[08:59.320 --> 09:02.680]  Wait till you get into the electoral college and what's happening with the electors being
[09:02.680 --> 09:05.360]  death-threaded and physically attacked and guns pointed at them.
[09:05.360 --> 09:06.360]  You name it.
[09:06.360 --> 09:11.480]  I mean, this is a soft civil war going on between the dupes of the globalist and the
[09:11.480 --> 09:15.960]  people that are somewhat awake fighting for a future where at least we have fair trade
[09:15.960 --> 09:20.800]  deals, not one-sided screw jobs that enrich the globalist.
[09:20.800 --> 09:23.320]  So we're going to break all this down today.
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.920]  We're now learning more that Obama and the Trump folks have confirmed this.
[09:26.920 --> 09:31.160]  So has the Hillary folks called Hillary that night at 1.30 Eastern.
[09:31.160 --> 09:34.840]  That's 12.30 central.
[09:34.840 --> 09:38.000]  They still didn't announce for over an hour and said, this is embarrassing.
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.240]  You're supposed to go out and concede.
[09:40.240 --> 09:41.560]  And then Hillary had to be sedated.
[09:41.560 --> 09:43.640]  She threw a big fit and went crazy.
[09:43.640 --> 09:49.520]  So the Obama folks coming out and telling the Hill and Bloomberg this confirms what
[09:49.520 --> 09:51.120]  we already knew from our sources.
[09:51.120 --> 09:52.760]  So that's triple confirmed now.
[09:52.760 --> 09:59.280]  And she went into a total tizzy because she knows Obama controlled at that time and still
[09:59.280 --> 10:05.080]  for another 54 days, the Justice Department, the FBI, you name it.
[10:05.080 --> 10:08.760]  And he was saying, look, I'm not going to stand by you if you try to contest this and
[10:08.760 --> 10:10.320]  have a civil war at this point.
[10:10.320 --> 10:12.800]  So Obama basically flushed Hillary at that point.
[10:12.800 --> 10:14.560]  She attacked Podesta.
[10:14.560 --> 10:18.280]  She reportedly attacked others, had to be sedated and then rolled out the next day looking
[10:18.280 --> 10:21.560]  completely drugged out of her mind for just a few minutes and then disappeared for about
[10:21.560 --> 10:26.560]  a week and a half, then popped back up looking like she'd aged 15 years, completely mentally
[10:26.560 --> 10:27.560]  ill.
[10:27.560 --> 10:31.560]  So we've got that to get into.
[10:31.560 --> 10:35.680]  We've got Trump to pressure foreign leaders to probe Clinton Foundation.
[10:35.680 --> 10:37.000]  That's on infowars.com.
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.040]  I was told this on Thanksgiving by one of our sources that let's just say is extremely
[10:44.040 --> 10:45.680]  close to the president.
[10:45.680 --> 10:48.040]  And look, the Clintons have figured this out so I can say this now.
[10:48.040 --> 10:52.200]  I was told this a few weeks ago and I was told this again a few days ago.
[10:52.200 --> 10:58.520]  What, what, what was Tuesday that was Thanksgiving so like four days ago.
[10:58.520 --> 11:05.720]  I was told that, hey, of course, Trump's not going to go after Hillary.
[11:05.720 --> 11:06.720]  That's not a president's job.
[11:06.720 --> 11:08.560]  It'll be his AG.
[11:08.560 --> 11:11.440]  So what we had already been surmising is clearly the plan.
[11:11.440 --> 11:15.240]  And I was also told there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.720]  Now I didn't so much want to come out and shoot a video about this because it hadn't
[11:18.720 --> 11:19.720]  broken yet.
[11:19.720 --> 11:23.000]  And I almost don't want the other side to know this, even though I think they're smart
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.080]  enough to know Trump's playing possum with them.
[11:25.080 --> 11:28.880]  That's why they're trying to overthrow his election, why they've got death threats, the
[11:28.880 --> 11:30.640]  the electors are being death-threaded.
[11:30.640 --> 11:35.520]  All hell is breaking loose while so many libertarians and constitutionalists and conservatives
[11:35.520 --> 11:39.800]  and nationalists and folks that just want a free market system.
[11:39.800 --> 11:44.400]  While we're all celebrating, folks, we're far from out of the woods as I kept saying
[11:44.400 --> 11:47.560]  for the last two weeks and I've now confirmed it.
[11:47.560 --> 11:51.840]  Now the New York Post came out today with the big headline and they've talked to the
[11:51.840 --> 11:58.880]  insiders as well and that indeed he is going to push for foreign governments to release
[11:58.880 --> 12:03.240]  the information on the foundation, just like we pressure the Swiss, it's all legal and
[12:03.240 --> 12:07.440]  lawful to release info on Americans here that are doing illegal stuff or have illegal
[12:07.440 --> 12:12.280]  Swiss bank accounts or questionable accounts, the Obama's did that some.
[12:12.280 --> 12:15.720]  He's going to legally and lawfully do that and that will destroy them because there's
[12:15.720 --> 12:17.880]  reportedly tens of billions.
[12:17.880 --> 12:22.120]  You don't think she sold out the whole world just for a couple hundred million, do you?
[12:22.120 --> 12:27.200]  So Trump to pressure foreign leaders to probe Clinton Foundation and notice this is all
[12:27.200 --> 12:30.200]  coming out now because Hillary reneged on her deal.
[12:30.200 --> 12:35.160]  There was word that the word came down, you're going to be left alone as long as you behave
[12:35.160 --> 12:38.400]  because it'll be too embarrassing for the country, but you got to step down and shut
[12:38.400 --> 12:43.080]  up now or you know what else is about to come out in the WikiLeaks.
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.640]  Hillary didn't do it, folks.
[12:44.640 --> 12:49.040]  And I'm not saying that these behind the scenes conversations, it's like at 2.30 in the morning
[12:49.040 --> 12:56.440]  central, 3.30 in the morning Eastern when Trump finally walked out, said, sorry, folks,
[12:56.440 --> 12:57.960]  sorry, I've been having to wait.
[12:57.960 --> 13:00.560]  It's been really complicated behind the scenes.
[13:00.560 --> 13:07.960]  It was Trump, Obama, Hillary, I mean major deals going on.
[13:07.960 --> 13:08.960]  Major deals.
[13:08.960 --> 13:12.360]  Notice right around that time or about a week and up before Assange disappeared, he's ever
[13:12.360 --> 13:16.720]  been seen or heard from since except in one phone call that sounds fake.
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.680]  So to say we're living in the middle of a spy thriller is a joke.
[13:21.680 --> 13:23.960]  This is like a spy killer to the power of 10.
[13:23.960 --> 13:26.080]  This is over the top crazy town.
[13:26.080 --> 13:29.760]  It's all coming up in the second hour as well.
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.280]  Trump administration will pressure foreign states, Clinton, Trump administration will
[13:34.280 --> 13:39.080]  pressure foreign states to probe Clinton Foundation.
[13:39.080 --> 13:40.080]  Another article.
[13:40.080 --> 13:42.600]  Trump supporters target George Soros over protest.
[13:42.600 --> 13:46.440]  So that's USA Today, New York Post, infowars.com.
[13:46.440 --> 13:51.520]  It's all up on infowars.com right now.
[13:51.520 --> 13:52.520]  So we've got that.
[13:52.520 --> 13:58.440]  Then we've got a really important stack of news that deals with the latest salvos to
[13:58.440 --> 14:01.000]  censor free speech.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.400]  They're never going to claim their censoring or shutting down real journalists.
[14:04.400 --> 14:05.760]  No, no, no, no, no.
[14:05.760 --> 14:08.960]  They're going to decide what real journalism is.
[14:08.960 --> 14:17.600]  And then now that the UN International Consortium has taken over the internet, now this can
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.560]  be implemented and basically directed from the Hague.
[14:22.560 --> 14:27.040]  So we've got stacks of news from the New York Times, the Washington Post, RT, you name
[14:27.040 --> 14:28.040]  it.
[14:28.040 --> 14:33.600]  Openly announcing, including infowars.com, Drudge has been now added to the list.
[14:33.600 --> 14:39.840]  The most influential news portal in the world, hands down, breaking more stories than probably
[14:39.840 --> 14:42.680]  any other news institution out there of global import.
[14:42.680 --> 14:44.960]  They're now announcing Drudge is fake.
[14:44.960 --> 14:45.960]  Shut it down.
[14:45.960 --> 14:51.000]  In fact, the new media blacklist calls it Russian propaganda.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.560]  Isn't that a joke?
[14:52.560 --> 14:55.040]  So guess who put the new list out?
[14:55.040 --> 14:59.840]  The Washington Post, owned by Mr. Bezos, a Democratic Party operative.
[14:59.840 --> 15:00.840]  But it gets worse.
[15:00.840 --> 15:01.840]  Guess where the list came from?
[15:01.840 --> 15:05.280]  They're fencing it because they know they can get sued for torturous interference for
[15:05.280 --> 15:09.080]  this to an unknown website and no one knows who owns it.
[15:09.080 --> 15:12.800]  So this professor backs down after a week of her fake list out there.
[15:12.800 --> 15:16.000]  Of course, the onion isn't on it.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.560]  We are because we're so hardcore and so effective.
[15:20.560 --> 15:21.560]  That disappears.
[15:21.560 --> 15:22.880]  They take that down because it's fraud.
[15:22.880 --> 15:29.240]  And then now some imaginary group wanted to put their name on it is the new media chiefs.
[15:29.240 --> 15:31.160]  Can you say Southern Poverty Law Center?
[15:31.160 --> 15:33.400]  Can you say George Soros?
[15:33.400 --> 15:37.480]  So just some group, we don't know who has a website and they just tell you what reality
[15:37.480 --> 15:38.480]  is.
[15:38.480 --> 15:39.480]  Now, you know, don't trust yourself.
[15:39.480 --> 15:40.720]  Don't do your own research.
[15:40.720 --> 15:41.720]  They're going to tell you.
[15:41.720 --> 15:43.520]  Well, that's coming up.
[15:43.520 --> 15:47.160]  But first, when we return, remember all the devil worship stuff that came out?
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.400]  All the bizarre blood drinking and weirdness in the Podesta emails and the spirit cooking?
[15:51.400 --> 15:56.560]  Well, now it's exploded the last few weeks into pizza game and they're shocking new developments
[15:56.560 --> 15:57.560]  straight ahead.
[15:57.560 --> 16:04.960]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense,
[16:04.960 --> 16:05.960]  probiotic.
[16:05.960 --> 16:12.680]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[16:12.680 --> 16:20.360]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[16:20.360 --> 16:25.320]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[16:25.320 --> 16:31.960]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[16:31.960 --> 16:36.520]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[16:36.520 --> 16:39.040]  probiotic on the market.
[16:39.040 --> 16:43.440]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at info wars life.com
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.720]  today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[16:47.720 --> 16:51.960]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public.
[16:51.960 --> 16:57.760]  So please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[16:57.760 --> 17:02.280]  We have the new product at info wars life.com bio true selenium.
[17:02.280 --> 17:07.040]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able
[17:07.040 --> 17:13.400]  to source a certified organic bio available selenium from mustard seed extract.
[17:13.400 --> 17:17.840]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[17:17.840 --> 17:18.840]  body.
[17:18.840 --> 17:20.960]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[17:20.960 --> 17:26.760]  It helps detoxify selenium is another one of those absolute must have the highest concentration
[17:26.760 --> 17:30.280]  of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[17:30.280 --> 17:36.600]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[17:36.600 --> 17:41.920]  So it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[17:41.920 --> 17:43.680]  I'm taking it now every day.
[17:43.680 --> 17:48.920]  This is soaking bio true selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[17:48.920 --> 17:52.360]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price exclusively available at info
[17:52.360 --> 17:58.760]  wars life.com or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine
[17:58.760 --> 17:59.760]  brain force.
[17:59.760 --> 18:00.760]  It's completely different.
[18:00.760 --> 18:01.760]  Try a bottle of it.
[18:01.760 --> 18:03.600]  Rob do joins us.
[18:03.600 --> 18:06.080]  You worked, I guess like 20 plus hours.
[18:06.080 --> 18:07.600]  Tell us what brain force get.
[18:07.600 --> 18:08.600]  I've been working all day.
[18:08.600 --> 18:11.040]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[18:11.040 --> 18:13.040]  I get in here at 830.
[18:13.040 --> 18:14.480]  I was kind of run down.
[18:14.480 --> 18:17.240]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good
[18:17.240 --> 18:18.240]  job on the interview.
[18:18.240 --> 18:20.120]  I got my bottle of brain force right there.
[18:20.120 --> 18:25.160]  Pop two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like being everything just kind of clears
[18:25.160 --> 18:26.160]  up.
[18:26.160 --> 18:27.160]  It's got four and a half stars.
[18:27.160 --> 18:28.160]  People really love it.
[18:28.160 --> 18:29.160]  Read about it.
[18:29.160 --> 18:33.320]  Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really
[18:33.320 --> 18:38.040]  does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[18:38.040 --> 18:40.840]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have
[18:40.840 --> 18:42.080]  done it without brain force.
[18:42.080 --> 18:47.320]  I went home about 645 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain
[18:47.320 --> 18:48.320]  force and came in.
[18:48.320 --> 18:58.440]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[18:58.440 --> 19:03.840]  We're selling a product, DNA force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[19:03.840 --> 19:04.840]  produce.
[19:04.840 --> 19:08.140]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[19:08.140 --> 19:11.560]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[19:11.560 --> 19:13.800]  it's very, very important.
[19:13.800 --> 19:20.440]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[19:20.440 --> 19:22.720]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[19:22.720 --> 19:24.800]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[19:24.800 --> 19:29.120]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[19:29.120 --> 19:32.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[19:32.000 --> 19:33.680]  It works like an antioxidant.
[19:33.680 --> 19:36.560]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[19:36.560 --> 19:39.760]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[19:39.760 --> 19:40.800]  It's in powder form.
[19:40.800 --> 19:43.480]  We have so many five star reviews.
[19:43.480 --> 19:44.480]  I take this.
[19:44.480 --> 19:49.000]  This is the product that I take, infowarslife.com, and the product we make.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  We fight the globals.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  We fight the new world order.
[19:51.000 --> 20:02.880]  Secure your DNA force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[20:02.880 --> 20:13.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:13.440 --> 20:15.280]  We are on the march.
[20:15.280 --> 20:18.320]  The empire is on the run.
[20:18.320 --> 20:22.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[20:22.240 --> 20:27.560]  Okay, so this video was on the nightly news on Thanksgiving.
[20:27.560 --> 20:30.320]  John Baum, one of our investigative journalists, put it together.
[20:30.320 --> 20:31.320]  It's five minutes long.
[20:31.320 --> 20:33.920]  I'm going to air it in about four minutes.
[20:33.920 --> 20:38.120]  And the headline is pizza gate is real.
[20:38.120 --> 20:40.000]  Only question is exactly what is it?
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.640]  But something with codes is going on.
[20:43.640 --> 20:47.400]  Now the New York Times and the Washington Post and every other major publication in
[20:47.400 --> 20:52.920]  the last few days has done stories basically saying, oh, it's part of the Russian propaganda
[20:52.920 --> 20:57.960]  fake news claiming that there's all these code words in the Podesta emails.
[20:57.960 --> 21:09.320]  Well, if you go back to the first days of November, it was all over the news.
[21:09.320 --> 21:13.880]  The weird satanic rituals and stuff like, we'll have the kids for your entertainment
[21:13.880 --> 21:21.000]  ages six, seven and eight in the hot tub waiting and Obama wants $60,000 plus worth of hot
[21:21.000 --> 21:26.920]  dogs and then they're getting delivered and then you go to law enforcement, sex code documents.
[21:26.920 --> 21:28.960]  They're using all the key codes.
[21:28.960 --> 21:33.440]  The codes for kids, the codes for men, the codes for women, the codes for black people,
[21:33.440 --> 21:34.960]  the codes for Latinos.
[21:34.960 --> 21:37.360]  I mean, it's all there, folks.
[21:37.360 --> 21:40.680]  Get out of FBI source manuals.
[21:40.680 --> 21:42.680]  And so we're one of the first groups to cover it.
[21:42.680 --> 21:46.320]  I just said, could this be code for drug dealing?
[21:46.320 --> 21:47.680]  Could this be code for something else?
[21:47.680 --> 21:48.680]  I don't know.
[21:48.680 --> 21:51.840]  It's so horrible that I just said, what is this?
[21:51.840 --> 21:56.720]  It's like photos of kids at parties with images of people bleeding to death with women and
[21:56.720 --> 22:02.280]  satanic outfits, drinking blood and then Podesta says, I'll see you at the spirit cooking dinner
[22:02.280 --> 22:07.680]  and it's the most dark form of black magic that Aleister Crowley was involved in.
[22:07.680 --> 22:12.200]  So we covered it and then every few days we've had reporters cover it, new reports.
[22:12.200 --> 22:15.600]  I've talked about it and I saw this meme, you know, Alex Jones isn't covering this
[22:15.600 --> 22:19.280]  and I thought, you know, that really was a big area of thousands of emails.
[22:19.280 --> 22:20.280]  Where did that go?
[22:20.280 --> 22:23.320]  So I went back to last few days and looked at it and found out John Bound had done a report
[22:23.320 --> 22:25.960]  I missed and it was just so horrifying.
[22:25.960 --> 22:29.960]  I'm just like, I don't see how you see anything else watching this.
[22:29.960 --> 22:34.120]  For radio listeners, you'll hear it and say, okay, that sounds pretty bad, but when you
[22:34.120 --> 22:40.840]  look at the logos from law enforcement manuals on how pedophiles, traffic kids, the codes
[22:40.840 --> 22:48.000]  they use and you see the very images on businesses connected to Podesta and then you read Washington
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.720]  Post articles where the Podestas are talking about how they love to photograph the naked
[22:51.720 --> 22:55.480]  kids in their neighborhood and then as soon as we report it, the Washington Post pulls
[22:55.480 --> 23:01.560]  the article the next day from like seven years ago and then they just say, oh, it's fake
[23:01.560 --> 23:02.560]  news.
[23:02.560 --> 23:03.560]  Don't listen to it.
[23:03.560 --> 23:06.560]  Listen, I don't know what this is.
[23:06.560 --> 23:13.200]  It's like you're driving along in the country and you see some rotting dead animal in the
[23:13.200 --> 23:14.200]  ditch.
[23:14.200 --> 23:15.200]  He goes, is that a cow?
[23:15.200 --> 23:16.200]  Is that a horse?
[23:16.200 --> 23:17.200]  Or is it like maggots all over?
[23:17.200 --> 23:18.200]  It's something big.
[23:18.200 --> 23:19.200]  It's something dead.
[23:19.200 --> 23:20.200]  It's something stinks really bad.
[23:20.200 --> 23:25.000]  So fearing at another witch hunt, Reddit bans it and so I went to see how about Reddit
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.600]  was censoring and found Alex Jones was in there, Alex Jones won't cover this either.
[23:29.600 --> 23:35.880]  Well, no, I'll cover it responsibly because there's thousands of these emails.
[23:35.880 --> 23:37.120]  Some of them may be innocuous.
[23:37.120 --> 23:42.040]  I'm sure some of the folks are innocent or did they give them code words to use for politics
[23:42.040 --> 23:43.160]  knowing it was a setup?
[23:43.160 --> 23:44.480]  I'm not giving them a way out.
[23:44.480 --> 23:50.400]  I'm just saying, man, when you go on air and you point fingers at people and say they're
[23:50.400 --> 23:54.800]  trafficking kids, you better have your act together because listen, we have to process
[23:54.800 --> 23:56.640]  in this country.
[23:56.640 --> 24:01.680]  I'm drawing major attention to this, but I'm not somebody on an email or or anonymously
[24:01.680 --> 24:03.080]  commenting.
[24:03.080 --> 24:08.600]  We have according to Quantcast and other major rating services, the biggest radio show in
[24:08.600 --> 24:11.160]  the world now.
[24:11.160 --> 24:17.200]  Hands down, hands down info wars.com alone is 126 on the worldwide web way bigger than
[24:17.200 --> 24:25.520]  bbc.com way bigger than New York Times.com only thing bigger is drudge in news, drudge.
[24:25.520 --> 24:27.360]  Now that's a responsibility.
[24:27.360 --> 24:31.200]  Now that said, I'm not responding this because a few trolls say, hey, you're not covering
[24:31.200 --> 24:32.200]  it.
[24:32.200 --> 24:33.200]  We have covered it.
[24:33.200 --> 24:35.680]  We drudge carried our big story about spirit cooking and the occult stuff.
[24:35.680 --> 24:37.640]  It was the biggest story on the web for two days.
[24:37.640 --> 24:40.400]  We had like six million readers on our website alone.
[24:40.400 --> 24:41.400]  Everyone else copied it.
[24:41.400 --> 24:44.400]  I can't even tell you how big it is.
[24:44.400 --> 24:47.960]  Hope asked me how big is your audience, I said, I can't tell you president elect because
[24:47.960 --> 24:51.080]  you know, maybe you have an article with six million readers, one of the biggest in a month.
[24:51.080 --> 24:52.080]  Everybody else copies it.
[24:52.080 --> 24:53.080]  We don't know, sir.
[24:53.080 --> 24:56.760]  You know, I'm going to keep talking until we come back to the next step because it'll
[24:56.760 --> 24:58.200]  take me some time to go over all this.
[24:58.200 --> 25:02.720]  The point is this is so dangerous, so big, so important.
[25:02.720 --> 25:08.440]  We shouldn't half-ass this and then not get it right so people that are involved in whatever
[25:08.440 --> 25:12.520]  it is don't get in trouble because let me tell you something.
[25:12.520 --> 25:16.920]  I got caught up in the campaign, I get caught up in WikiLeaks and Where's the Sange, I get
[25:16.920 --> 25:21.960]  caught up in all these talk of wars and the economy and who is Trump going to appoint and
[25:21.960 --> 25:24.840]  trying to just get tax cuts for Americans.
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.720]  And so I kind of have my reporters covering Pizza Gate and I've mentioned it some.
[25:29.720 --> 25:34.480]  But you know, quite frankly, I just instinctively shy away from stuff like this.
[25:34.480 --> 25:38.120]  I'll be watching, you know, TV and flip to the channels will have some special on pedophiles
[25:38.120 --> 25:41.800]  and I just keep flipping or Jeffrey Dahmer, man, I'm not into this stuff.
[25:41.800 --> 25:45.480]  But yes, I have a responsibility to cover it and yes, it's important.
[25:45.480 --> 25:50.440]  And yes, quite frankly, now that I've looked into more of the humant indigenous research
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.560]  of just millions of people, it's horrible.
[25:54.560 --> 26:00.960]  And I couldn't sleep last night and you know, people want me to look into it.
[26:00.960 --> 26:03.560]  I may as well take off a week and just only research this and actually go to where these
[26:03.560 --> 26:04.560]  places are and stuff.
[26:04.560 --> 26:07.480]  In fact, I'm looking at it on a plane.
[26:07.480 --> 26:09.240]  I just like Bohemian Grove and stuff.
[26:09.240 --> 26:12.120]  I can't just say something and not see it for myself.
[26:12.120 --> 26:13.360]  They go to these pizza places.
[26:13.360 --> 26:16.440]  There's like satanic art everywhere.
[26:16.440 --> 26:22.440]  There's art of these people where they're shoving children into women's vaginas.
[26:22.440 --> 26:23.640]  I can't even say this stuff on air.
[26:23.640 --> 26:27.280]  I mean, you know, something's going and then they have rock bands that come play there.
[26:27.280 --> 26:29.960]  They talk about their preference being kids and stuff.
[26:29.960 --> 26:35.920]  You know, I don't man, I'm telling you, man, I like spent five hours yesterday looking
[26:35.920 --> 26:37.840]  to this and I feel dirty right now.
[26:37.840 --> 26:47.640]  I mean, I feel spiritually raped and listen, I'm not bitching and I'm not complaining,
[26:47.640 --> 26:49.760]  but I just can't do this this hard anymore.
[26:49.760 --> 26:50.760]  Okay.
[26:50.760 --> 26:53.560]  I just cannot continue to look at, look at Hillary and these people all the time.
[26:53.560 --> 26:54.560]  I just can't do it.
[26:54.560 --> 26:55.560]  Okay.
[26:55.560 --> 26:58.760]  You know, they say cops get screwed up for months when they find a seller full of dead
[26:58.760 --> 27:02.320]  kids or, you know, come in and they see a dead toddler, you know, that snorted a bunch
[27:02.320 --> 27:03.320]  of cocaine.
[27:03.320 --> 27:05.400]  I've got a friend who's an EMT and he did it for like eight years.
[27:05.400 --> 27:08.400]  He finally had to quit cause it was just like the six or seventh dead kid.
[27:08.400 --> 27:13.040]  You see, you know, you want to kill their parents, you know, a pit bull kill somebody's
[27:13.040 --> 27:14.040]  three year old.
[27:14.040 --> 27:15.040]  You want to go to the house.
[27:15.040 --> 27:16.040]  There's a freaking dead kid.
[27:16.040 --> 27:17.040]  You want to kill the people.
[27:17.040 --> 27:18.040]  That's why I couldn't work.
[27:18.040 --> 27:19.040]  Have that job.
[27:19.040 --> 27:20.040]  I get it.
[27:20.040 --> 27:21.040]  I look at this stuff and I can't handle it.
[27:21.040 --> 27:23.800]  I want to buy airplane tickets.
[27:23.800 --> 27:25.880]  So but get this through your damn head.
[27:25.880 --> 27:27.080]  I'm not covering any of this up.
[27:27.080 --> 27:29.080]  I never cover anything up.
[27:29.080 --> 27:30.080]  There's just so much evil.
[27:30.080 --> 27:34.440]  I'm not trying to drink Lake superior through a freaking pixie straw and listen, I can't
[27:34.440 --> 27:37.480]  do it anymore.
[27:37.480 --> 27:40.200]  And then I start thinking before the show, you know, I didn't even, I'm not even doing
[27:40.200 --> 27:41.200]  this justice.
[27:41.200 --> 27:45.600]  There are thousands of mainstream news articles in England with Jimmy Savelle and the Royal
[27:45.600 --> 27:49.560]  Family and little kids they dig up on their estates and his torture dungeons and him raping
[27:49.560 --> 27:53.560]  dead bodies of kids and slitting throats of kids in front of the prime minister and devil
[27:53.560 --> 27:54.560]  worship.
[27:54.560 --> 27:57.880]  And then they say it's national security in the UK and they can't even go there cause
[27:57.880 --> 27:58.880]  it's so big.
[27:58.880 --> 28:03.600]  And then the Catholic church and then Boys Town and then Penn State, Jerry Sandusty raping
[28:03.600 --> 28:11.120]  little kids in the field house on Tuesday morning, Saturday morning, Sunday afternoons.
[28:11.120 --> 28:16.320]  Field houses when I played high school ball were like airports during the day.
[28:16.320 --> 28:21.800]  A freaking college field house I've been in one once was incredibly busy during the week.
[28:21.800 --> 28:26.760]  So I had friends that played at UT that I went to high school with and then they went
[28:26.760 --> 28:28.640]  to UT and they invited me to see the field house once.
[28:28.640 --> 28:29.800]  It was just the same thing.
[28:29.800 --> 28:33.680]  Let me tell you that he ran a foundation that was supplying kids to a whole bunch of people
[28:33.680 --> 28:34.680]  and I just don't get it.
[28:34.680 --> 28:38.240]  I mean I don't get it but I get it they're vampires that want to feed on the energy of
[28:38.240 --> 28:39.240]  kids.
[28:39.240 --> 28:40.240]  Is everybody in these thousands of emails guilty?
[28:40.240 --> 28:41.740]  No.
[28:41.740 --> 28:44.400]  That's why I try to read these thousands of emails and it's so sick.
[28:44.400 --> 28:47.680]  Oh I love the sauce on the hot dogs.
[28:47.680 --> 28:52.360]  Oh God yes, Obama wants 60 plus thousand dollars in hot dogs delivered right now.
[28:52.360 --> 28:53.360]  That's a lot of hot dogs.
[28:53.360 --> 28:54.360]  Oh these are good hot dogs.
[28:54.360 --> 29:00.560]  I'm craving sucking on hot dogs it's like what the hell introducing vitamin mineral fusion

[29:34.520 --> 29:38.840]  and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[29:38.840 --> 29:43.200]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.

[29:48.640 --> 29:50.360]  quality lab standard.
[29:50.360 --> 29:51.800]  That means it's clean.
[29:51.800 --> 29:52.800]  That means it's pure.
[29:52.800 --> 29:55.880]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.

[29:59.040 --> 30:00.920]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[30:00.920 --> 30:02.920]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[30:02.920 --> 30:05.800]  It's the air we're breathing especially for our children.
[30:05.800 --> 30:11.840]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[30:11.840 --> 30:16.800]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[30:16.800 --> 30:21.080]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze.
[30:21.080 --> 30:25.280]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family,
[30:25.280 --> 30:26.280]  your children.
[30:26.280 --> 30:28.600]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[30:28.600 --> 30:33.640]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[30:33.640 --> 30:36.600]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[30:36.600 --> 30:38.840]  The general public doesn't.
[30:38.840 --> 30:42.760]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[30:42.760 --> 30:46.400]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[30:46.400 --> 30:49.960]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[30:49.960 --> 30:53.160]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[31:08.280 --> 31:12.880]  appliances at your house like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.

[33:16.120 --> 33:21.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[33:21.800 --> 33:23.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:23.800 --> 33:29.280]  You want to understand the globalist thinking people that have no soul and enjoy hurting
[33:29.280 --> 33:32.400]  innocents and sucking life force out of it.
[33:32.400 --> 33:38.360]  That's what all the live sale, all the old legends tell us about evil people is they
[33:38.360 --> 33:43.880]  go after our children and history shows that every major elite in history, once it became
[33:43.880 --> 33:50.240]  corrupt, set up a priesthood that sacrificed children to dark gods and that is still going
[33:50.240 --> 33:51.240]  on today.
[33:51.240 --> 33:56.600]  Now, I want to be clear on everybody in the WikiLeaks is involved in this, clearly.
[33:56.600 --> 34:00.680]  You have to go investigate it for yourself, but I will warn you, this story that's been
[34:00.680 --> 34:07.280]  the biggest thing on the Internet for several weeks, PizzaGate, as it's called, is a rabbit
[34:07.280 --> 34:09.160]  hole that is horrifying to go down.
[34:09.160 --> 34:13.240]  Now, if you're a radio listener, this is a powerful video, but I've had it reposted
[34:13.240 --> 34:16.160]  because, again, he finished it, I guess, on Wednesday.
[34:16.160 --> 34:20.760]  It went out Thursday on the nightly news that was taped the other day before.
[34:20.760 --> 34:22.160]  This is on infowarsteam.com.
[34:22.160 --> 34:23.160]  PizzaGate is real.
[34:23.160 --> 34:26.680]  The only question is, what exactly is it?
[34:26.680 --> 34:30.720]  Because I'd said, man, I hope this is drug dealing code word or something, or maybe
[34:30.720 --> 34:35.800]  they got the wrong manual because this is the FBI says this is pedophilia manuals.
[34:35.800 --> 34:39.760]  Now, these are the terms they use, and then here's the New York Times.
[34:39.760 --> 34:43.400]  Fake news on Target's pizzeria as nest of child traffickers.
[34:43.400 --> 34:48.640]  Hey, I don't know why the pizzeria and the one down the street have symbols of the FBI
[34:48.640 --> 34:49.640]  dossier.
[34:49.640 --> 34:50.640]  I don't know why there's devil worship part on the walls.
[34:50.640 --> 34:52.160]  I don't know why it's connected to Patesta.
[34:52.160 --> 34:56.760]  I don't know why they got rock singers there talking about, you know, going after kids
[34:56.760 --> 34:57.760]  or whatever.
[34:57.760 --> 35:00.880]  This is what's going on, though.
[35:00.880 --> 35:03.000]  And so maybe it's just some genre they picked up.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  They don't know what they're involved in.
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  I'm not accusing of anything.
[35:05.000 --> 35:12.000]  I mean, it's not like they look like little piggy people or anything.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.640]  It's not like they fit all the cliches or anything when you go to the, just like nice
[35:16.640 --> 35:17.640]  people to me.
[35:17.640 --> 35:22.440]  But the point is, is that this is tied into Patesta with thousands of emails with, we're
[35:22.440 --> 35:27.000]  going to have the six-year-old, the seven-year-old, and eight-year-old in the hot tub for your
[35:27.000 --> 35:30.080]  entertainment out at the ranch house.
[35:30.080 --> 35:34.680]  They can be a little persnickety, but they are also willing and enjoy it.
[35:34.680 --> 35:39.440]  I mean, there's thousands of these, and you're reading it going, what the hell is this?
[35:39.440 --> 35:41.240]  And you start reading it.
[35:41.240 --> 35:45.920]  There's thousands and thousands and thousands, and you know you're reading something real
[35:45.920 --> 35:47.920]  bad.
[35:47.920 --> 35:51.120]  Oh, I'll see you at the feast tonight.
[35:51.120 --> 35:53.000]  Oh, we'll have lots of blood and semen.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  Oh, good.
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.320]  And then they had like Time Magazine worshiping this high priestess the week after we exposed
[35:58.320 --> 36:02.760]  her about news, all this PR, like, oh, we'll show them they're attacking our high priestesses.
[36:02.760 --> 36:06.440]  We'll just put them in the news better, like, we're all upstanding and out in the open and
[36:06.440 --> 36:07.440]  good people.
[36:07.440 --> 36:10.600]  Look, I've been careful about all this.
[36:10.600 --> 36:11.600]  This is lawsuit city.
[36:11.600 --> 36:13.360]  I don't know what the hell is going on with these people.
[36:13.360 --> 36:17.120]  I know straight up devil worship when I see it and find quotes of her saying it's real
[36:17.120 --> 36:18.640]  when she does it privately.
[36:18.640 --> 36:20.760]  Could you harass me anything?
[36:20.760 --> 36:21.760]  Reddit accounts.
[36:21.760 --> 36:27.080]  I mean, I know real bathroomette worship when I see it, but thousands of emails.
[36:27.080 --> 36:29.200]  I'm not ready to accuse those of these people of this.
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.240]  It's up to you to research it for yourself, but you've got to go to m4wars.com and actually
[36:33.240 --> 36:36.240]  see the photos and videos inside these places.
[36:36.240 --> 36:39.160]  You've got to see their menus.
[36:39.160 --> 36:41.680]  You've got to see it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:41.680 --> 36:45.600]  And then you've got to see the FBI law enforcement manuals showing the code words that are used.
[36:45.600 --> 36:47.320]  And by the way, I didn't just believe this.
[36:47.320 --> 36:48.520]  I went to the FBI site.
[36:48.520 --> 36:52.040]  I went and looked it all up and people asked, well, why weren't you on this earlier?
[36:52.040 --> 36:53.280]  We were on it from the beginning.
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.880]  We've been on it the last couple of weeks since the election, but we're fighting on hundreds
[36:57.880 --> 37:00.080]  of fronts here.
[37:00.080 --> 37:01.240]  Let's go ahead and go to the report.
[37:01.240 --> 37:02.840]  Pizza gate is real.
[37:02.840 --> 37:04.320]  The question is how real is it?
[37:04.320 --> 37:05.320]  What is it?
[37:05.320 --> 37:06.320]  Something's going on.
[37:06.320 --> 37:07.320]  Something's being covered up.
[37:07.320 --> 37:08.320]  It needs to be investigated.
[37:08.320 --> 37:09.800]  You just call it fake news.
[37:09.800 --> 37:10.920]  These are real WikiLeaks.
[37:10.920 --> 37:12.280]  This is real stuff going on.
[37:12.280 --> 37:13.280]  Here it is.
[37:13.280 --> 37:17.360]  A warning to viewers, the following images are disturbing.
[37:17.360 --> 37:22.600]  This all began after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange released hundreds of thousands of
[37:22.600 --> 37:27.880]  secret documents detailing a backstabbing Clinton Foundation, but it now appears the
[37:27.880 --> 37:34.040]  real truth Assange was leading us to was hidden between the blurred lines of Hillary Clinton's
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.400]  campaign manager, John Podesta's, released emails.
[37:38.400 --> 37:44.880]  As forward past John Podesta's brother, Tony's, casual email exchange with the lemak spirit
[37:44.880 --> 37:49.480]  cooking adherent Marina Abramovic, the Rosetta Stone was needed next.
[37:49.480 --> 37:55.960]  A verification that high level Washington DC predatory pedophiles were using a code
[37:55.960 --> 38:01.440]  to communicate child sex trafficking as casually as ordering a pizza.
[38:01.440 --> 38:07.840]  An FBI unclassified document from WikiLeaks revealed symbols and logos used by pedophiles
[38:07.840 --> 38:10.520]  to identify sexual preferences.
[38:10.520 --> 38:15.400]  To include those who sexually abuse children as well as those who produce, distribute and
[38:15.400 --> 38:21.440]  trade child pornography are using various types of identification logos or symbols
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.840]  to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences.
[38:26.840 --> 38:32.920]  Investigators should also be attentive to pedophilia symbols advertised on websites.
[38:32.920 --> 38:38.360]  During examinations of computer files, investigators should be conscious of subjects who try to
[38:38.360 --> 38:44.160]  conceal child pornography by labeling them with symbols instead of typical suggestive
[38:44.160 --> 38:45.800]  explicit names.
[38:45.800 --> 38:49.880]  Thus, the interest in code words now clues.
[38:49.880 --> 38:52.040]  The menu from Comet Ping Pong.
[38:52.040 --> 38:58.280]  Notice the symbol of the ping pong paddles and its clever resemblance to the FBI documents
[38:58.280 --> 39:00.160]  symbol for child love.
[39:00.160 --> 39:06.040]  Alright, hang on New York Times, before you declare this fake news from your ivory tower,
[39:06.040 --> 39:12.160]  now look at the symbol for Besta Pizza, just two doors down from Comet Ping Pong Pizza.
[39:12.160 --> 39:18.640]  Boldly using the symbol for boy lover as was recorded on the unclassified FBI document.
[39:18.640 --> 39:25.320]  The evidence begins to reveal that Besta Pizza and Comet Ping Pong Pizza may be competing
[39:25.320 --> 39:29.880]  for the lucrative Washington DC pedophile market right out in the open.
[39:29.880 --> 39:36.320]  Comet Ping Pong owner James Alifantis needs to explain himself, and so he did, via the
[39:36.320 --> 39:42.640]  Hillary Clinton colluding New York Times, but so many questions remain unanswered.
[39:42.640 --> 40:06.680]  Why was this said by the band Heavy Breathing performing in Comet Ping Pong?
[40:06.680 --> 40:12.840]  Why is the artwork adorning Comet Ping Pong's walls at the very least so insanely creepy,
[40:12.840 --> 40:15.440]  especially for a family restaurant?
[40:15.440 --> 40:20.800]  Why is Alifantis so close to Tony Podesta as revealed in the WikiLeaks emails?
[40:20.800 --> 40:27.120]  And why does Mr. Podesta collect questionable artwork specializing in grotesque eroticism
[40:27.120 --> 40:32.560]  and pedophilic images, not to mention Podesta's dabbling in what appears to be cannibalistic
[40:32.560 --> 40:38.960]  rituals while continuing his old friendship with convicted pedophile Dennis Hastert?
[40:38.960 --> 40:43.300]  Why is this man wearing an I Love Children shirt in this situation?
[40:43.300 --> 40:49.020]  Why did you write hashtag murder next to this incredibly creepy photo you posted?
[40:49.020 --> 40:52.680]  Why do you find it amusing that this baby is for sale?
[40:52.680 --> 40:55.400]  Why do you associate with this artist?
[40:55.400 --> 40:57.680]  Why is any of this okay?
[40:57.680 --> 41:02.960]  If these code words are eventually proven to be just another method of communication,
[41:02.960 --> 41:08.800]  then why did the Podesta emails mention the code word pasta for either little boy or sex
[41:08.800 --> 41:14.480]  78 times, code word cheese for little girl 85 times?
[41:14.480 --> 41:19.600]  And what does Podesta's friend, Her, mean by this statement from a Podesta email?
[41:19.600 --> 41:25.200]  PS, do you think I'll do better playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta?
[41:25.200 --> 41:32.200]  According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the FBI, 460,699
[41:32.200 --> 41:34.720]  children went missing in 2015.
[41:34.720 --> 41:35.720]  That we know of.
[41:35.720 --> 41:41.240]  Mr. Alifantis, this isn't a witch hunt and it isn't an attack from fake news that your
[41:41.240 --> 41:45.920]  boyfriend David Brock, founder of Media Matters, would have us all ignore.
[41:45.920 --> 41:51.840]  Either you are the unlucky victim of a fake news onslaught due to your own poorly initiated
[41:51.840 --> 41:57.880]  publicity or a decades old pedophile ring operating in the power hoarding shadows of
[41:57.880 --> 42:07.160]  Washington D.C. is about to be opened from your front door, John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[42:07.160 --> 42:11.160]  Trump won, Hillary stole five states was ordered to stand down by the intelligence
[42:11.160 --> 42:13.240]  agencies or everything else to come out on this.
[42:13.240 --> 42:16.360]  If you're a radio listener, you're lucky you didn't actually see the video.
[42:16.360 --> 42:21.800]  The art they tweet and Facebook is of children being murdered, cut in pieces and raped by
[42:21.800 --> 42:23.800]  men with a giant genitalia.
[42:23.800 --> 42:34.560]  So, oh yeah, oh yeah, so I don't know anymore, but that's what they're pushing, what they
[42:34.560 --> 42:37.560]  got hanging up in there and it's what they're doing.
[42:37.560 --> 42:39.720]  And I can't go out there and investigate it myself.
[42:39.720 --> 42:40.920]  We've had reporters on that have been there.
[42:40.920 --> 42:46.200]  They say it's really creepy because I don't have the self-control to be around these
[42:46.200 --> 42:47.200]  top people.
[42:47.200 --> 42:49.680]  So, you want us to cover Pizza Gate?
[42:49.680 --> 42:50.680]  We have covered it.
[42:50.680 --> 42:51.680]  We are covering it.
[42:51.680 --> 42:52.680]  All we know is God help us.
[42:52.680 --> 42:53.680]  We're in the hands of pure evil.
[42:53.680 --> 42:54.680]  We'll be right back.
[42:54.680 --> 42:55.680]  I'm Alex Shoneson, ForWars.com.
[42:55.680 --> 43:01.680]  Well, it looks like President-elect Donald Trump is making good on his promise as day
[43:01.680 --> 43:04.960]  one of the Trump presidency to withdraw from the TPP.
[43:04.960 --> 43:08.960]  We have an article that's up on our website, infowars.com, and aggregated from CNS News.
[43:08.960 --> 43:12.760]  It talks about how Trump characterized the move, a part of a plan to advance the simple
[43:12.760 --> 43:15.160]  core principle of, quote, putting America first.
[43:15.160 --> 43:16.800]  Of course, that's been his credo.
[43:16.800 --> 43:18.520]  Down with globalism, the entire campaign.
[43:18.520 --> 43:22.320]  And now that President-elect Donald Trump, who set on Monday that his first day in office
[43:22.320 --> 43:27.200]  next January, will begin the process of withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a prospective
[43:27.200 --> 43:30.840]  trade deal which has been the centerpiece of the Obama administration, he's going to
[43:30.840 --> 43:31.840]  rebalance it.
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.840]  Now, the Obama administration wanted to rebalance to Asia, but Trump called that a horrible idea.
[43:36.840 --> 43:40.880]  He sang in an online video message that one of his top priorities in the first 100 days
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.120]  is to ask his transition team to, quote, develop a list of executive actions we can take on
[43:45.120 --> 43:48.640]  day one to restore our laws and bring back our jobs.
[43:48.640 --> 43:52.480]  It's about time when he echoes a sentiment that everyday Americans afield cross this
[43:52.480 --> 43:55.000]  country and it looks like he's making good on his promise.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.840]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for infowars.com.
[43:57.840 --> 44:01.280]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[44:01.280 --> 44:06.560]  Deep Cleanse by infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolines
[44:06.560 --> 44:10.680]  and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[44:10.680 --> 44:14.760]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanse is our most affordable
[44:14.760 --> 44:15.880]  all-in-one cleanser.
[44:15.880 --> 44:22.400]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, folvic acid, orange peel, zeolines
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.320]  and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[44:25.320 --> 44:29.720]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old
[44:29.720 --> 44:33.920]  scientific research that puts together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[44:33.920 --> 44:38.920]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary
[44:38.920 --> 44:41.240]  spike-GRX herbal processing technique.
[44:41.240 --> 44:45.520]  We use only the highest-quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring
[44:45.520 --> 44:47.480]  it to you at the best price out there.

[44:52.560 --> 45:22.400]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[45:22.560 --> 45:27.320]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[45:27.320 --> 45:31.280]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[45:31.280 --> 45:35.840]  nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting
[45:35.840 --> 45:40.120]  the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats and amino acids it
[45:40.120 --> 45:45.520]  needs to do its healing work, you need to check out infowarsteam.com.

[45:51.560 --> 45:54.840]  Follow the web at infowarsteam.com.
[45:54.840 --> 45:58.640]  That's infowarsteam.com.
[45:58.640 --> 46:03.120]  We have the new product at infowarslife.com, Biotru Selenium.
[46:03.120 --> 46:07.920]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently we were able
[46:07.920 --> 46:13.960]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[46:13.960 --> 46:18.720]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[46:18.720 --> 46:19.720]  body.
[46:19.720 --> 46:23.920]  It balances the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[46:23.920 --> 46:26.400]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[46:26.400 --> 46:30.360]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[46:30.360 --> 46:31.360]  all over the body.
[46:31.360 --> 46:37.440]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium,
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.760]  so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[46:42.760 --> 46:44.520]  I'm taking it now every day.
[46:44.520 --> 46:45.520]  This is soaking.
[46:45.520 --> 46:48.000]  Biotru Selenium is the product.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.200]  The best selenium that we could bring you, we believe is the best out there at a very,
[46:51.200 --> 46:52.200]  very low price.
[46:52.200 --> 47:02.880]  Exclusively available at infowarslife.com, or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five-three-three-one-three-nine.
[47:02.880 --> 47:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.080]  All right, now I'm officially blown away, folks.
[47:07.080 --> 47:18.440]  Get ready for this.
[47:18.440 --> 47:24.640]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[47:24.640 --> 47:26.640]  GCN radio network.
[47:26.640 --> 47:30.880]  All right, Julie DeSanche has disappeared, other than one interview doesn't sound like
[47:30.880 --> 47:31.880]  him over on telephone.
[47:31.880 --> 47:38.000]  They admit the embassy's basically holding him now criminally in a locked-up room and
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.400]  having prosecutors from Europe come and visit him.
[47:41.400 --> 47:42.400]  We've got that.
[47:42.400 --> 47:44.240]  We've got Phil Castro dying.
[47:44.240 --> 47:45.240]  I haven't even gotten to that.
[47:45.240 --> 47:46.240]  There's so much happening.
[47:46.240 --> 47:47.720]  But you went about crazy.
[47:47.720 --> 47:52.520]  Matt, one of the great producers, was showing me the official Andrew Breitbart Twitter.
[47:52.520 --> 47:58.160]  From 2011, I went and looked, yeah, it's Andrew Breitbart, the pioneer journalist.
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.000]  The Drudge Help Launch, it's Tim, and it's a comment about Podesta being a world-class
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.400]  child trafficker.
[48:04.400 --> 48:09.040]  Now, I was shown this about an hour ago, 10 minutes before showtime.
[48:09.040 --> 48:10.160]  I hadn't got to it yet.
[48:10.160 --> 48:19.160]  Joe Biggs, look at this, just texted me, how pronguru, John Podesta isn't household name
[48:19.160 --> 48:29.160]  as world-class underage sex slave, op cover, defending unspeakable dregs escapes me.
[48:29.160 --> 48:32.920]  And of course, Breitbart was dead in a year later.
[48:32.920 --> 48:38.040]  He said he had stuff coming out that would destroy forever, Obama.
[48:38.040 --> 48:43.640]  And the word we had was it was all the gay stuff out of Chicago.
[48:43.640 --> 48:47.800]  Hey, I'm all about people having free will with adults.
[48:47.800 --> 48:51.880]  My thing is you don't mess with kids, heterosexual, homosexual, I don't care, keep your hands
[48:51.880 --> 48:52.880]  off.
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.040]  But we're going to retweet Andrew Breitbart's comment, triple check, that's his verified
[48:57.040 --> 48:58.040]  account.
[48:58.040 --> 48:59.040]  It says it is.
[48:59.040 --> 49:00.040]  That is so wild.
[49:00.040 --> 49:03.440]  Yeah, I mean, the Podestas are so arrogant, part of this is doing it publicly.
[49:03.440 --> 49:10.880]  One of his brothers that's heavily involved in D.C. put out an article about how they
[49:10.880 --> 49:14.280]  take naked photos of the neighborhood kids and have them hanging up around their house.
[49:14.280 --> 49:16.240]  And that was like seven, eight years ago.
[49:16.240 --> 49:18.320]  He covered that in the Washington Post pulled it.
[49:18.320 --> 49:19.760]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[49:19.760 --> 49:23.160]  This is so.
[49:23.160 --> 49:24.160]  This is so crazy.
[49:24.160 --> 49:28.840]  The point is, whoever that was, Andrew Breitbart or whoever that was, that was five years ago.
[49:28.840 --> 49:35.920]  I want to segue into some other news now, obviously, but these are times that, you know,
[49:35.920 --> 49:36.920]  try folks souls.
[49:36.920 --> 49:41.240]  I want to get into some fake news and how the mainstream media is the main purveyor of
[49:41.240 --> 49:42.240]  that moment.
[49:42.240 --> 49:48.440]  So the other news out of Roger Stone joining us briefly, we're running Black Friday specials
[49:48.440 --> 49:49.720]  right through the weekend.
[49:49.720 --> 49:53.480]  And these are already great products at very low prices that everybody should want and use.
[49:53.480 --> 49:57.520]  Plus, even if they weren't great products, which they are, it's funding the tip of the
[49:57.520 --> 50:01.840]  spear that tells the truth like no other organization will put people to say, hey, Alex, you shouldn't
[50:01.840 --> 50:02.840]  have sponsors.
[50:02.840 --> 50:04.720]  That's mainstream media and trolls.
[50:04.720 --> 50:06.200]  You shouldn't fund yourself.
[50:06.200 --> 50:10.440]  We have the funding of a small town newspaper and we are bigger than the BBC and the New
[50:10.440 --> 50:12.440]  York Times online.
[50:12.440 --> 50:13.440]  Go to Quantcast.com.
[50:13.440 --> 50:14.440]  I'm not bragging.
[50:14.440 --> 50:15.440]  It's a fact.
[50:15.440 --> 50:18.760]  You're getting colloidal silver, silver bullet for $9.95.
[50:18.760 --> 50:22.360]  We get it from the national manufacturer that supplies whole foods that sells it for more
[50:22.360 --> 50:23.360]  than $20.
[50:23.360 --> 50:24.560]  But it's a sale.
[50:24.560 --> 50:26.120]  They sell it for $9.95.
[50:26.120 --> 50:28.240]  We sell it for $9.95 day in, day out.
[50:28.240 --> 50:32.520]  Silver bullet, our private label, 30 parts per million, the cleanest, purest out there.
[50:32.520 --> 50:33.520]  Not yellow folks.
[50:33.520 --> 50:34.520]  It's silver.
[50:34.520 --> 50:35.520]  That's when it's oxidized.
[50:35.520 --> 50:37.720]  It turns that word yellow meaning it wasn't done properly.
[50:37.720 --> 50:40.040]  This is pure clear water.
[50:40.040 --> 50:42.040]  Ionized water with the colloidal silver.
[50:42.040 --> 50:44.160]  I had it fourth row a few days ago.
[50:44.160 --> 50:45.160]  Drank some of this.
[50:45.160 --> 50:46.160]  Worked great for me.

[51:50.120 --> 51:54.680]  shield, nascent iodine X2, the good halogen, go research about the iodine conspiracy, the
[51:54.680 --> 51:59.480]  federal government's own documents that they've added iodine in the Midwest, well nationwide
[51:59.480 --> 52:03.720]  it started in the Midwest from the 20s through the 70s because IQs were so low, Gorder was
[52:03.720 --> 52:09.440]  so bad, thyroid problems were so huge, and IQs boosted up to 15% on average.
[52:09.440 --> 52:14.400]  Just Google, thyroid added to salt, 15% IQ increase.
[52:14.400 --> 52:17.840]  But most of the iodine on store shelves will kill you if you drink it, it's for topical.
[52:17.840 --> 52:22.840]  This is real iodine, not bound, not garbage, not chemical iodine, not from rotting seaweed,
[52:22.840 --> 52:26.320]  not from, this is from deep breath crystals, nobody else has got this.
[52:26.320 --> 52:30.760]  We were searching for a true iodine to put out and we got persecuted by enemies that
[52:30.760 --> 52:35.800]  found our supplier and shut it down and then just, God dropped it in our lap, a deep breath
[52:35.800 --> 52:39.880]  source that we've had now for four years, what a blessing, no weapon formed against
[52:39.880 --> 52:44.440]  us so prosper, want to thank you all for your support.

[53:02.720 --> 53:10.320]  I have delved into pizza gate, thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands
[53:10.320 --> 53:16.600]  and thousands, I mean there's thousands of emails, more than 30,000 just dealing with
[53:16.600 --> 53:21.520]  all this talk about, I can't wait for the succulent hot dogs, Obama wants 60,000 plus,
[53:21.520 --> 53:27.200]  oh my God, they're the best, oh, we're going to have them in DC and Hawaii, the hot dogs.
[53:27.200 --> 53:31.160]  Okay, Obama likes men and hot dogs, I mean I'll say for positive thing, it looks like
[53:31.160 --> 53:36.120]  he's after adult men, that's legal and lawful, I mean you know and then Hillary wants this
[53:36.120 --> 53:41.240]  and all this crap, I mean you cannot make this stuff up, you look at Weiner who's involved
[53:41.240 --> 53:47.000]  in all this, I mean what do you expect from these people and it's like what, we will have
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.680]  the children in the hot tub, one is six, one is seven, one is eight, some can be persnickety,
[53:51.680 --> 53:58.840]  but they do enjoy themselves, you know, go read it for yourself and then you see them
[53:58.840 --> 54:04.160]  having rock bands play, talking about stuff with kids and then kids being, I can't even
[54:04.160 --> 54:10.440]  say it on air folks, the video, we're going to tweet it out with Breitbart statement on
[54:10.440 --> 54:16.280]  infowarstore.com dealing with pizza gate, we're going to tweet it out right now at Real
[54:16.280 --> 54:20.800]  Alex Jones on Twitter and you just send it out, send it out because here's the deal,
[54:20.800 --> 54:25.920]  there's massive censorship on Reddit, on Twitter, on Facebook, everywhere and I'm not
[54:25.920 --> 54:32.720]  just going to come out and say what all this is, they may just have you know symbols that
[54:32.720 --> 54:37.240]  look closely like symbols the FBI says is what traffickers have and you may just have
[54:37.240 --> 54:40.720]  images of naked kids on the walls and may just be tweeting the stuff out and talking
[54:40.720 --> 54:44.000]  about torture and death of children and then may just have rock bands that are talking
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.840]  about you know your preferences of children because it's just an accident, probably is,
[54:48.840 --> 54:54.760]  I'm sure that's all that's going on here, see I start down this line, I can't stop
[54:54.760 --> 55:04.120]  see, what's Ben Grimm say, it's clobbering time, my instinct to see I'm not a killer,
[55:04.120 --> 55:20.240]  but when people mess with kids, it flips switches, really scary switches and I've been doing
[55:20.240 --> 55:25.400]  this too long, I've seen too much and I'm done for now talking about this because I
[55:25.400 --> 55:30.800]  can't stand it once I start looking into it, you go look into it, you're the human, you're
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.880]  the individuals, you're the listeners, just go out and do it, my crew will cover it but
[55:35.880 --> 55:42.360]  I just you know, it gets to me, I already know all this stuff and telling you for years
[55:42.360 --> 55:47.200]  they're much devil worse first, I don't know how some people can bitch at me when I'm the
[55:47.200 --> 55:51.600]  progenitor of exposing what they're into, how can some general who's won hundreds of
[55:51.600 --> 55:55.320]  wars for everybody be bad because I'm not just constantly obsessing on something that
[55:55.320 --> 56:00.320]  I quite frankly can't mentally deal with, now let's get into the other news here coming
[56:00.320 --> 56:02.000]  up.
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.680]  Fake news onslaught targets pizzeria as nests of child traffickers, New York Times, fearing
[56:07.680 --> 56:12.040]  at another witch hunt, Reddit bans pizza gate, Washington Post, pizza gate shows how
[56:12.040 --> 56:16.760]  fake news hurts real people, I'm sure you may insert in the email somebody who's innocent
[56:16.760 --> 56:21.480]  one involved, that's not our issue, the point is this got hacked by intelligence agencies
[56:21.480 --> 56:28.120]  to warn the world, the NYPD has told me directly and through sources that it's horrible child
[56:28.120 --> 56:31.880]  trafficking, I don't know about pizza gate and some other town, all I know is there's
[56:31.880 --> 56:35.120]  some stuff going on, will they red herring some innocent grip, maybe that's what we got
[56:35.120 --> 56:38.040]  to be careful.
[56:38.040 --> 56:43.160]  A fake conspiracy for our fevered age, Bloomberg, the same guy that says he doesn't want our
[56:43.160 --> 56:49.320]  guns, is there any relevance for pizza gate Reddit CEO, fans conspiracy theory flames
[56:49.320 --> 56:53.920]  by banning discussion of it, yeah, shouldn't do that, I don't know thousands of emails
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.920]  talking about code words and stuff, but the FBI issues and says our code words for pedophilia,
[56:58.920 --> 57:04.760]  but let's get into this right now, here's what's really important, EU censoring free
[57:04.760 --> 57:12.600]  speech with fake news claims says IFJ, we have some nebulous unnamed group that has
[57:12.600 --> 57:16.680]  come out, the Washington Post has now put out a new fake list and you go to the website
[57:16.680 --> 57:22.680]  and want me to say who it is, listing dredgerport.com, infowars.com is fake, and the International
[57:22.680 --> 57:25.920]  Federation of Journalists very respected has come out and said this is the way to stifle
[57:25.920 --> 57:29.920]  journalism, this is a fraud, and a lot of the sites listed, they're saying a lot of
[57:29.920 --> 57:33.560]  great work, yeah exactly, you let bad sites, good sites be there, we all know the Washington
[57:33.560 --> 57:37.800]  Post is fake news, CNN is fake news, and so I love how the fake news is saying we're fake
[57:37.800 --> 57:42.560]  news, and they're specifically crapping themselves over pizza gate, and their answer is to say
[57:42.560 --> 57:48.240]  it's all fake, no WikiLeaks release this, this is ending.
[57:48.240 --> 57:51.440]  Not a group you develop living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it, why
[57:51.440 --> 57:53.160]  is this so good?
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.840]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most,
[57:57.840 --> 58:02.480]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[58:02.480 --> 58:08.160]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[58:08.160 --> 58:13.920]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism, right now with all the refugees,
[58:13.920 --> 58:18.360]  spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere, these are all
[58:18.360 --> 58:21.600]  parasites, tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it,
[58:21.600 --> 58:26.560]  you have the name in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, I recommend
[58:26.560 --> 58:30.440]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year, alright well I'm glad we've got some
[58:30.440 --> 58:34.240]  back in because I'm going back on it today, it just came back in yesterday, living defense,
[58:34.240 --> 58:37.560]  infowarslife.com, and folks you can't lose, it's full of stuff that's great for your

[59:22.840 --> 59:27.400]  our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading

[59:52.840 --> 01:00:10.120]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war, it's
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:23.360]  a great show, Roger Stone former head of the Trump campaign, and the guy that plays down
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.300]  is Axis Influence will be joining us, I've only covered a third of the news I wanted
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:33.480]  to hit so far, if you go to our Twitter at realalexjones you can see that we're tweeting
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:40.400]  about what's really going on with pedophile gate or pervert gate, but you know it sounds
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.920]  totally alien to the normal person, but if you study history elites are always seeking
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.960]  after the innocence, most cultures end up getting a weird priesthood running it that
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.600]  are obsessed with the sacrifice of human children, so as I said I'm going to retweet
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.760]  out Andrew Breitbart's tweet from five years ago, have we done that yet, let's scroll down,
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:04.000]  I usually tweet myself when I'm on air obviously can't do it, where yeah, where reportedly
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.160]  Andrew Breitbart, I mean it was a real account, it looks like it says from five years ago,
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:17.280]  talked about the podestas and their activities, then you find them in the Washington Post
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.000]  talking about how much they love hanging up pictures of the naked neighborhood kids in
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.160]  their house, they called it a what radical art, revolutionary art, but I'm done talking
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.760]  about that now, I'm going to shift gears into what we can totally prove when we can document
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.200]  and they're coming after our free speech, when we talk about the EU being unelected,
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.120]  they call that fake news or wanting to ban it, the International Federation of Journalists
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.320]  is coming out saying it's a threat to free speech, using fake news against opposing views,
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:52.880]  a lot of the Washington Post and others have come out and promoted a new fake list, I don't
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.680]  even say who came up with the list, they just list some website that doesn't say who it
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:04.880]  is, absolutely no attribution, no proof, no bibliography, the one thing they put on a
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.800]  big list of fake news and then showed a bunch of examples per news agency who was fake,
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.080]  I called Paul Watson today and I said I'll do it if you don't have time, but I want
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.160]  to take the list we mentioned a few weeks ago that Ron Paul kind of picked up on and
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.840]  put back out and he said fake news is mainstream media that launched all these wars that lies
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.920]  to us that puts out fake debate questions beforehand and gets caught rigging everything,
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.880]  that's who's fake news, not us or exposing it, but we should just put out that whole
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:35.080]  list and then just point out, definitive list and hey by the way, info wars is saying this,
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.960]  here's our name, here's who we are, but you want to wonder how they're going to strike
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:47.160]  back as they lose control and lose their grasp over the people, this is it, tensions are
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:52.480]  reportedly rising and CNN as the network aims for Trump since the election, CNN has out
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:59.560]  MSNBC'd MSNBC, oh yeah it is, it is, he stole the election, he's not the president, the
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:06.800]  recount's reasonable, Hillary's involved now, it goes on and on and on, what a joke, the
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:13.160]  Clinton news network, speaking of them, the fake news, CNN accidentally falsely admitted
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.840]  it aired pornography for 30 minutes on Thanksgiving, it turned out it was their Boston affiliate
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.200]  aired 30 minutes of tranny porn and it was CNN feed that was supposed to be there, so
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:28.600]  they just can't get anything right, but that's okay because they're CNN, imagine they aired
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:35.760]  30 minutes of spirit cooking, a bunch of supermodels and people drinking blood, coming up Washington
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:48.440]  Post, Minion, Donald Trump's enemy, Barack Obama, has come out and again further basically
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.440]  worship for the El Castro, we're going to get to all of that coming up, meanwhile Obama
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:59.400]  urged Clinton to concede on election night, journalist tricked into spreading hoax Trump
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.760]  inspired attack, there's a video on that we're going to be getting to and so much more, oh
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:13.120]  yeah, folks they have turned the fake news game up to a whole new level, I'm seeing quotes
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.000]  and things that I never even said, it's not even edited quotes, it's not even quotes
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.560]  where they cut stuff off out of context, they're now just putting out entirely fake quotes
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:28.480]  on us to the point of I can't even keep track of it anymore, so it really is up to everybody
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:33.720]  out there just to stay focused and to remember what you saw and what you read and not believe
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.680]  anything MSM says because I bust my butt to actually give you what they said, what they
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:43.400]  did, what they claimed, who they stood for, but it is so hard with mainstream media because
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.880]  as they collapse, as they die, as they fail to deliver the wind to Hillary and George
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.600]  Soros and the globalists, they're not giving up, they are just doing what they always did
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:57.840]  but three or four times worse, hoping that they'll win, that's the definition of insanity
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:03.840]  in my book, please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will

[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.800]  45 after, then I'm going to get some other news we haven't gotten to in the last segment,
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.680]  no calls today because there's just so much on the plate, now I've talked to roger stone
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:44.480]  off record about the weird devil worship in the pedestrian emails, the weird talk about
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:48.280]  obama wants $60 plus thousand dollars in hot dogs, oh they're so luscious, I can't wait
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.880]  to get one, we'll have three kids in the hot tub for you at the farmhouse, you know they're
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.840]  going to be responsive, I mean this is scary stuff folks, I'm not saying everybody involved
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.240]  in emails or pedophiles, I'm not saying clearly that goes on in England, it goes on here,
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.800]  it's come out that a lot of political elites are involved in that, I brought it up to him
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.160]  and he talked about some heavy hitters that said no there's definitely something going
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.760]  on here, I've talked to people involved in the NYPD over a month ago, they said look
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:21.080]  that's what's being held over the head that if Hillary tries to go forward is going to
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:26.840]  be brought out, Assange hasn't done a real interview, he did supposedly some phone interview
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:32.720]  but it doesn't even sound like him in 40 something days, so a lot is going on, I want to get
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:38.320]  into Romney, I remember talking to a little bird separate from Stone but calling Stone
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.080]  over a week ago and saying I hear that Conway is doing the right thing and is against this
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:47.440]  Romney deal and I talked to others so but now she's in the news today openly coming
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.280]  out saying did Romney even vote for Trump, so wow it's good to see her standing up, we
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:56.400]  know Bannon's against it but really it's a major line of the sand for a lot of people
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:00.840]  and it's a test of will Trump stand up for the base and what he stood for, I'm giving
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.560]  him benefit of the doubt till he gets in, that's what really matters to me, I know major
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.760]  enemies in this country are his enemies so I'm giving him benefit of the doubt but because
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.960]  he may just put these folks in because they know how to run things and later kick them
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:17.480]  out, Trump's a smart guy, we've got that, we've got the recount that I knew was serious
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:21.600]  and now Hillary's joined it, so Trump's been forced to actually respond to it, it was a
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.920]  big joke three or four days ago, it's not now, so Roger Stone and this whole pantheon
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.320]  where do you want to begin?
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:35.360]  Well Mitt Romney's probably an excellent place to start Alex, like you I commend Kellyanne
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.680]  Conway for saying what everybody at the grassroots of the Trump movement is saying, I mean there's
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.920]  several dimensions to this, Mitt Romney didn't just not support Donald Trump, he called him
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:55.120]  and I quote a con man, close quote a quote phony quote and a fraud, that's not like saying
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:01.240]  he's not qualified but more importantly his appointment would send a signal to world leaders
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:06.880]  and everybody in the United States that you can essentially don't find Trump and nothing
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880]  happens to you.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:11.360]  That's right, he's running up a white flag, he's saying bend me over a barrel and let
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.920]  me just add something to interrupt here, this is the guy that helped write Obamacare, Mitt
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:19.640]  Romney, this is the guy that ran all these pump and dumps, the guy that ran all these
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.400]  corporate takeovers of legitimate businesses, this is the guy that movies like Wall Street
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.040]  are made about, he's everything wrong with the Republican Party, he's a slime bag so
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.320]  Trump better stand up against him, sorry go ahead, he's the con man's what I'm saying.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:40.200]  Not only that but he is more, he's more bellicose on Russia than Trump, he kind of takes the
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:48.760]  neocon hard line, he basically borrowed his ideology, such as it is, with the Bushes,
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.000]  he was not even a registered Republican two years before he ran for governor, he ran to
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.360]  the U.S. Senate, to Ted Kennedy's left, if there is any space over there.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.280]  But more importantly, he doesn't share the president's vision, I would say this, that
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:08.040]  if you look at it historically, the greatest secretary of states and the ones who had the
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.520]  most credibility in the world were the ones that had a personal relationship with the
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:17.680]  president, Baker and Bush, Nixon and so on.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:25.240]  So I think that speaks to Rudy Giuliani, now Rudy and I are not a perfect ideological
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:30.920]  fit, I just drew them on many things but I will say this, when the fight came, he gave
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:33.560]  the only fight speech at the convention other than General Flynn.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.220]  And let's go further, I don't know if you can say this because I've got issues with
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:40.920]  Giuliani, he's not perfect, but since the campaign got down to the rubber meet and the
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:46.160]  road, Giuliani with the NYPD and stuff, they really came through exposing the Clintons
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:50.560]  at the key clinch moment, I mean Giuliani really helped deliver the White House.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:57.640]  Well, I think that's true, I also think that in terms of getting the NYPD to publicly lay
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:03.120]  this record out at an appropriate time, if there is an attempt by the Justice Department
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.200]  to bury it, to cover it up, would Giuliani may yet have a role to play in this?
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:12.440]  So you can confirm what my sources are saying, the torpedoes are on them with the emails,
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.320]  if the Clintons or anybody else tries anything torpedoes will launch.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:24.040]  Well, here's what I do know, that on the Monday before the election, when Director Comey of
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:30.360]  the FBI said nothing did folks keep track of the base, there was enormous pressure put
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:38.440]  on NYPD, that members of the department would be indicted in the Eric Garner case, if NYPD
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.280]  did not stand down for some period of time.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:51.040]  You know, through the election, but the fact that the president has elected, that he doesn't
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:57.200]  want to prosecute the Clintons, that's fine, but it's almost outdated because I think there
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:03.760]  will be substantially more proof of wrongdoing, and at some point the American people are
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.760]  going to demand justice.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.320]  Sure, Roger Stone, I want to get to that, I don't want to give inside baseball out that
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.840]  I've gotten from my other sources, but talk to you about, clearly it's not the president's
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.160]  job to go out for someone, and the Democrats already know he is planning to do justice,
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.560]  his constituents demand it, justice demands it, it was in the New York Post today, I knew
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.640]  this four days ago but didn't go with it, that he's basically going to have foreign
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:34.720]  leaders, just like Obama had Switzerland exposed to his bank accounts, Trump is going to tell
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.240]  foreign leaders do the right thing and release the Clinton Foundation info, that's the New
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:44.880]  York Post, it's on infowars.com, Kit Daniels wrote about it, I don't sit on this, but at
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.800]  a certain point at this level of strategy, I don't want to sit there and give them what's
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.760]  coming down the pipe, but I think they're smart enough to know Trump's playing possum
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.760]  till he gets in.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:02.600]  Well, maybe this is Alex Parton's insurance, you see, perhaps that is what's going on here,
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.760]  Trump is a shrewd poker player, perhaps he understands that if he expressed his desire
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.440]  to move ahead aggressively today on the question of the prosecution, that they would get an
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:16.560]  immediate pardon and therefore would legally evade justice.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.280]  So maybe that is what he's doing.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:25.480]  Never second-guess him, I learned that a long time ago, I think at the end of the day it
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.880]  may be premature.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:33.560]  Now, I saw on infowars that pressure had been put on, not pressure, but Chelsea had lobbied
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:38.080]  one of the Trump children to, you know, can't we all be friends?
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.520]  Is that accurate info I got from one of my other sources?
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.240]  Yes, it is 100% correct.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.320]  I heard it from an additional source.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:52.360]  So you know that they have a concern, you can tell they have a concern.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:59.160]  Well, I mean, Sessions, I'm told from another source, did not take the appointment unless
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.360]  he could have a free hand and the two men really like each other and the word is Sessions
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.840]  is going to have a true free hand.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:12.280]  Yes, I think that's true, which in one sense, I'm happy if you could come and order me on
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:19.680]  the question of legalized marijuana, was havoc to us, has only enforced the same law in the
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.000]  states that are already legally have been-
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.720]  Sure, I don't agree with Sessions on the whole drug war thing, but you know, you can't throw
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.720]  the baby out with the bath water.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.440]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, looking at this then, starting to get into
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.560]  this now, we'll get into recount coming on the next segment.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.200]  From what I've seen in the tea leaves and the news, with Bannon coming out public, with
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.040]  Conway coming out public, obviously myself and others coming out public, I mean, it looks
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:49.840]  like Trump is getting the fact that Mitt Romney is really like a turd in the punch-pull.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:58.760]  This week, it has not gotten reviews from the grassroots, the real question of course
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:04.880]  is where is Wright's previous in this, Wright's is after all, you know, his chairman of the
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:10.840]  party when Romney was the nominee and they are close friends, so he has denied to several
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:17.760]  media outlets that he is an advocate for this, but my, that would you-wise, I think that's
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.040]  how perfunctory hello got to be this.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.080]  I don't think this is serving the president well.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:29.240]  Somebody who shares his worldview and that's not met me, somebody who has to denigrate
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.240]  it.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.560]  All right, Roger Stone of StoneColdTruth.com is our guest.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.560]  He's on cell phone.

[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.360]  I'm going to try to see if he can do audio Skype when we come back, but regardless, we're
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.040]  going to come back with Roger Stone on the other side.

[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.280]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.480]  it's very, very important.
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:20.120]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.880]  These are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.480]  And when it runs out, you start dying.

[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:11.840]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I get in here
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.200]  at 830, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.600]  and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brain force
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.560]  right there, I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like bing, everything
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:28.240]  just kind of clears up, it's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:32.880]  about it, find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.960]  really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.920]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while but I probably could not have done
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:41.920]  it without brain force.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:46.920]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.240]  force and came in.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:20:02.360]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:20.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:39.080]  Thanks to Tyrants, his obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:44.520]  Donald Trump on his Twitter calls Roger Stone loyal and tough and that is certainly the
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:50.400]  case, great guy, works harder than I do, it makes my head spin how his age he can do it.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.640]  He's with us for one more segment after this, then I'm going to get to Donald Trump at a
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:02.360]  rare video from Fox 9, the number one channel in New York, on 9-11 saying bombs in the buildings,
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.840]  wow, just had some more credibility to Donald Trump because there were bombs in the buildings,
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:08.840]  I've talked to the firefighters, we don't know who planted them or what was happening,
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.080]  we just show there's a cover up but amazing, it just makes me like Donald Trump that much
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080]  more.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.360]  Finishing up with Romney because your audio was cutting out a bit, Roger Stone of StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.680]  I'm going to add you're now hosting a once a week show in the fourth hour, Wednesdays
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:26.040]  in my fourth hour of this Wednesday, I'm going to be hosting for two hours, very excited
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.040]  about that.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:31.880]  And soon I'm going to be adding more shows here in my own network, so I'll be with GCN,
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.080]  they'll syndicate my show but I'm going to add more broadcasts here with quality folks
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.080]  like Roger Stone.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.440]  But just briefly, I want to get into the whole recount of the big enchiladas, obviously,
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:46.320]  but I know we don't want to be wrong, only Trump knows, but it does seem like the sun
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:49.600]  is setting a bit on Romney, or am I wrong?
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:57.080]  Well, Alex, it is my understanding that Romney will see the president-elect on Tuesday, so
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:03.800]  I think we will know shortly, but I think that the grassroots reaction to it is something
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.880]  the president can't fail to be seeing.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:11.960]  Now I'm not going to suggest what he should do, not tell him what to do, but I've outlined
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:18.600]  all the reasons here and elsewhere that why Romney is a bad idea, his bellicose position
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.800]  on Russia, his personal assaults, and insults to Donald Trump.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.960]  Big laughs of Ted Kennedy.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.480]  And working against us in Utah.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:35.360]  So, and I think Rudy would be a superior appointment if that is the choice, then Rudy
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.360]  has again.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.360]  What about Petraeus?
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.360]  What about Petraeus?
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:41.080]  Well, Petraeus, that would be an interesting pick.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:46.040]  I mean, it would certainly make it very hard not to prosecute Hillary going forward if
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:50.160]  General Petraeus got this job because it would highlight his conviction.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.400]  Well, sure, he's not perfect, but he didn't write Obamacare and he didn't call Trump
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.400]  a con artist.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:02.520]  Well, and he didn't make documents available to former foreign countries through an unsecured
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.520]  service.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:07.280]  Well, my word is from really high-level patriots is that Petraeus tried to clean up the CIA
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.840]  and that's why they did that to him.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:18.560]  I think that he probably was set up, but look, his transgression is not nearly as egregious
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.560]  as what Hillary has done.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:20.560]  It's not 100,000.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.800]  I mean, it literally is like not even on the same universe.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:32.720]  And this shows you the inequity here, wasn't the lesson of Watergate that no one is above
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:33.720]  the law?
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.040]  Isn't that what they said endlessly?
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.040]  That's right.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.040]  Okay, I interrupted you with that.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.240]  Let's get into the big enchilada as you were saying.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:44.400]  What in your research view is behind this recount that Hillary's now joined?
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.960]  She swore she wouldn't join it.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:46.960]  What's behind that?
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.280]  Well, let's look at this for a moment.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.840]  There's two ironic things going on here.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:58.240]  When I wrote for the Hill newspaper a long piece on the fact that I was concerned that
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.640]  these computerized voting machines can easily be hacked.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.640]  You were a total cook.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.640]  It didn't exist.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.640]  No such thing.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.640]  Now she's saying that.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.640]  Right.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:10.680]  She was on the other foot and they're demanding a recount.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.400]  Clearly Jill Stein is fronting for someone.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.960]  She was unable to raise $5 million for her presidential campaign, but she raised $5 million
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.280]  overnight for a recount.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.760]  It's now 7 million.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:28.840]  The recount is unnecessary, I guess I should say, in any two-day period.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.920]  She raised $5 million in two days.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:33.000]  This didn't come from the grassroots.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.800]  This probably came from some Hillary bot.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.200]  Oh, they admit that and she's only going at her state's Trump one.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.680]  How obvious is that?
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:46.480]  Well, what's interesting in Wisconsin is the analysis of Nate Silver, formerly the New
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:53.240]  York Times, who points out that the inconsistencies between the returns in the paper ballots and
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:59.440]  the computerized machines is explained by demographics, not device.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.480]  Of course, rural areas are more likely to have paper ballots.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.600]  Rural areas are more likely to have machines.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.520]  I mean, I don't think there's anything to recount here.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:16.600]  They would have to, by my arithmetic, flip, I guess three states and that's just not
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.600]  going to happen.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.280]  I don't think Trump's victory is insecure any place.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:29.920]  So this is a last minute dodge by Soros and the boys to try to hijack this.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.240]  And by the way, I'm queuing up the clip of her during the debate saying she would never
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:37.040]  challenge the election and that Trump was insane.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.560]  So how does she do this now?
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.560]  That's exactly right.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:45.080]  That's the other half of this, which is they excoriated him for not blindly saying, I'll
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.160]  accept the results of the election, even if I don't know if there's been cheating.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.640]  And when he wouldn't say that, they went crazy saying he was tearing at the very fabric
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.800]  of American democracy that he was undermining our democratic process.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:02.080]  But now the shoes on the other foot, it just shows you what epic hypocrites the clip.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080]  I agree.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.320]  So let me ask you a quick question here.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.320]  What is the real strategy?
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.360]  Is it just to embarrass him, make it look like he's not really the president?
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.120]  Or is it really try to get the electors who admit they're getting death-threaded, guns
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.120]  pointed at him?
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.240]  I mean, that's even, you know, in the New York Times, the World Net Daily's reporting
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.240]  on it.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.240]  They're getting threats everywhere and we won't know, I guess, till the 19th of the
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.240]  20th of December.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.760]  Yeah, I think that is exactly right.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:33.920]  Look, I think this week is gonna tell us a lot in terms of the president elect's appointments.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.080]  I think you're gonna get a secretary of the interior this week.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.880]  I think you're gonna get a secretary of state this week.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.960]  And those are pivotal, I mean, Trump has made a lot of pledges regarding, you know, federal
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.680]  lands and easing up on control of federal lands and people are going to be seeing whether
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.600]  he is going to fulfill his commitments.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:57.560]  All right, stay there, we're gonna come back in a final segment with Roger Stone.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:02.600]  I want to play a clip, though, of Hillary during a debate with then-candidate Republican
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.760]  nominee for president Donald Trump breaking down election results.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.760]  Here it is.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.680]  Well, Chris, let me respond to that because that's horrifying.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:17.320]  You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.680]  it is is rigged against him.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:24.840]  The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my emails, they concluded there was no
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.840]  case.
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.440]  He said the FBI was rigged.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.120]  He lost the Iowa caucus, he lost the Wisconsin primary.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.880]  He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.720]  Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.240]  He claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.920]  There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.320]  and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.520]  This is a mindset.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:01.240]  This is how Donald thinks, and it's funny, but it's also really troubling.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.760]  That is not the way our democracy works.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760]  We've been around for 240 years.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.200]  Roger, we're gonna break in 40 seconds, but this is just outrageous that she's joined
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.200]  this whole deal.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.880]  Again, what do you think they're really trying to get here?
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.640]  I think it's a last-ditch effect.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:18.600]  Maybe they are concerned about going to jail.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:24.280]  Maybe they aren't really buying the assurances of the president, which I think are heartfelt
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:29.280]  to try to heal the nation, but probably premature due to the fact that we don't even have a
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.520]  catalog of their crimes.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.200]  These people are, you know, they're operators, they're drifters.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.040]  They will never, ever give up and Soros is not going to abandon his goal of...
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.040]  That's right.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.000]  They think we're all dumb and they're never gonna give up.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.760]  We gotta run them over politically.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.680]  Roger Stone's our guest on all the shows with infowars.com.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.040]  They're censoring that site.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.040]  They don't want that out.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.040]  They're attacking it.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.040]  The president's attacking it.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.040]  Hillary's attacking it.
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.360]  Spread those links, folks.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:59.480]  It's coffin nails politically to these dirtbags.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:04.480]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:10.080]  constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.480]  ignorance of the nature of coin, credit, and circulation.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.360]  Those are the words of John Adams.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.600]  The second president of the United States.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.160]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.240]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:28.120]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.520]  and to profit from it?
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.200]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.600]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.960]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.960]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.560]  Join the InfoWars.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.560]  Spread the information.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.560]  Educate yourself and others.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.480]  The truth shall set you free.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:59.040]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.840]  We have the new products at InfoWarsandLife.com.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.560]  Bio, true, Selenium.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.320]  We've had so many requests over the years for Selenium and just recently we were able
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:14.320]  to source a certified organic bioavailable Selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:19.160]  When you take Selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.160]  body.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.240]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.760]  It helps detoxify.
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.840]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:30.800]  The highest concentration of Selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:31.800]  all over the body.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:37.880]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon Selenium,
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:43.200]  so it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.360]  I'm taking it now.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:45.360]  Every day.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360]  This is so key.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.480]  Bio, true, Selenium is the product.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.200]  The best Selenium that we could bring you.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.440]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:56.960]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsandLife.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five,
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.800]  three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:02.760]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:03.760]  nutraceuticals.

[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.600]  Check it out for yourself today.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.400]  I want to tell you about a brand new Off The Rib product.
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.600]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.600]  Even though it's so small, you can put it in your pocket.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:10.840]  It can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators to keep
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.280]  your food from spoiling.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.880]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:15.880]  It's mobile.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.720]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:25.280]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, basically creating
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.720]  your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:28.720]  A true innovation.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.000]  I have never seen anything like this.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.680]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:35.240]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:39.360]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.520]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.520]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.720]  Limited one for household.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:11.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.760]  We are on the march.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.840]  The empire is on the run.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:27.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.880]  All the back tomorrow, picking off 11 a.m. Central, 12 noon Eastern for the four-hour
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:32.880]  weekday transmission.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.840]  I cannot stress to you that I'm not trying to act big here, but I know that the president's
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.840]  attacking us as fake news.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:46.360]  The New York Times, Washington Post, the Sunday Morning Herald, the BBC.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:52.680]  We're really freaking out because infowars.com, according to Quantcast and Google Analytics,
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.200]  is the 126th biggest website in the world.
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.840]  And it's only 27% of our reach every day.
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:04.600]  We're huge on Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.200]  And I tell people during the election, we had 85 million people conservatively watch
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.200]  the videos, the live videos, the tape videos.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.080]  We just counted them up that week just on our own platforms and a few others.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.600]  We can't add them all up.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.600]  There's too many.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.600]  The way the Internet works.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.160]  A trestle radio went from 3 million a day to like 5 million a day.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.960]  Now that went down a little bit since the election, but it's still a whole new plateau
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:29.200]  of 40 million video views a week, 20 million radio listeners a week.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.040]  I mean, we've gone to like 250 something affiliates.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.560]  I'm cutting affiliate agreements and new promos for stations every day now.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:39.360]  I'm not bitching, but boy, let me tell you, it's taking my life over.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:46.480]  So Info Wars and its success is only an example of the vacuum mainstream media left open.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.320]  It's not that I'm that good.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.320]  It's that they're that bad.
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.920]  But I'll tell you who is good, it's you, the listeners.
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.920]  You are amazing.
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.920]  I want to thank you for your support.
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.220]  Keep spreading the word.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:59.240]  We're having a huge effect, but the fight has just begun.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.240]  Roger, in the time we've got left, I want to thank you.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:06.760]  I know you're going to be co-hosting some this week doing a lot of great work here with
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.960]  the syndicated radio show.
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.000]  But I want to move through a bunch of points now with you.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.680]  But before I get into Fidel Castro, before I get into Sheriff Clark is the head of Homeland
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:16.680]  Security.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.680]  I think it'd be a great guy.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:20.920]  Before I hit a few other pieces, anything else, any other tidbits you'd like to talk
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:21.920]  about that I haven't raised?
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:25.120]  I mean, Alex, you pretty much covered my agenda.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.120]  I'm trying to chart this transition very carefully.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.880]  And I think it is also the inaugural committee is going to get off the ground this week.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:40.840]  And it's still a very exciting time with a lot of intrigue as the establishment types
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.960]  try to invade the new administration.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.840]  So far, I think they have been fairly unsuccessful.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.800]  So the neoconboarding parties, as you call them, have been repulsed?
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.920]  Well, it's not over yet.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.920]  I mean, it's never over until it's over.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.200]  And Trump has to form a full government.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.200]  We shall see how that works out.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.200]  All right.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:04.840]  And getting to my questions, what do you make of Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau worshiping
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:05.840]  Castro?
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.840]  I don't know if you saw it.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:07.840]  We have a clip of it.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.840]  I'm not going to play it because of time constraints.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.080]  Just saying he's the biggest.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.080]  The guy's an icon.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.080]  The guy was amazing.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:16.080]  He didn't kill most folks, like other communist regimes, he only killed a couple hundred
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.080]  thousand.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.200]  But he did terrible things.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.480]  He lived like a king as his people became poor.
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:25.880]  I mean, to watch the leftist politicians worship Castro makes me sick.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:26.880]  Yeah.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.160]  Look, the guy was a mass murderer.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.480]  He was a tyrant.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.920]  He was an oppressor of Christians and gays and women.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.960]  He was a thug.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.600]  And now, frankly, we had a whack, Raul.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.680]  I mean, this doesn't mean democracy comes to the island.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.080]  All it means is that Castro finally is dead.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.880]  This guy almost made it from Eisenhower to Trump.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.320]  It's quite a run.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.280]  Imagine how it feels to see from France, to you name it, leftist politicians like Hollande
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.800]  way behind the polls, Marie Le Pen way ahead, you know, the media is saying, oh, it's the
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.800]  Trump effect.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.800]  Isn't it really the national?
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:06.280]  I mean, I want to give Trump credit, but isn't it the nationalism, the global awakening
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.280]  to globalism?
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.520]  Isn't that what we're seeing?
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:09.840]  Take everybody to power.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:12.360]  Well, I think it is.
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:13.880]  It is both things.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:20.960]  I think in this country, it is widespread unhappiness about the two-party duopoly and the policies
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.360]  that have driven us into the ditch.
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.640]  And the people were just ready for something new.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:31.880]  And the mainstream media miscalculated enormously their attempts to discredit and destroy Trump
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:34.200]  only made him stronger.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.200]  Classic Jiu Jitsu.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:41.760]  I'm going to reveal all of this in my upcoming book, Making a President 2016, how Donald
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.200]  Trump orchestrated an American Revolution, which will be out actually from Sky Horse
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.600]  on Inauguration Day.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:51.200]  There's no doubt if he is the real deal, which I think he is.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.160]  This will be the second American Revolution, and by the way, I've already put in the biggest
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.680]  pre-order that Sky Horse has.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.320]  We will have it here, folks, and then I'll support the broadcast.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.400]  But I'm told this book is going to be legend.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.400]  It's just amazing.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.560]  Getting back to Inside Baseball, I haven't asked you this question.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.280]  I was told this by another source that Obama actually called Hillary that night, and then
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.640]  she blew up and had to be sedated.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.400]  You told me about her having to be sedated.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.360]  That came out even in CNN a week later.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.280]  Obama urged Clinton to concede on nine of election.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.960]  Is that what you were told, or have you heard this?
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.440]  I have heard that, but I think they were going by the returns that they had.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:31.720]  This new confection coming out of Jill Stein, I mean, I just don't know that there's enough
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:36.920]  evidence to justify a recount, but when I talked about my concerns about the system,
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:39.800]  I was derided as a crank.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:44.960]  When I talked about the fact that these machines could be inaccurate, I was treated like some
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.960]  kind of pariah.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:50.360]  And we may remember Media Matters called on the Hill to never publish another office.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.360]  Oh, I know.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.360]  I was there with you.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.840]  But listen, that's discredited media.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:59.840]  I mean, it's pox upon their houses, so even Obama has basically split with the Clintons.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.120]  More and more, I'm told, they're totally alone.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.240]  They're completely freaked out.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:06.280]  I think they realize that their day is coming.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.480]  I think that is true, and they're endowed.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:12.560]  I mean, this is going to be a long haul, but I think we have to continue to make the
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:17.840]  case that we are a nation of laws not men, and if we're in jury, we should make this
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:18.840]  decision.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.040]  Well, Alex, I got to run.
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.040]  Many thanks.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.040]  All right.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.040]  Thank you.
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.040]  There goes Roger Stone.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.040]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.560]  There's so much to break down, so much to go over.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.560]  This whole Fidel Castro thing, yeah, the guy was a man's man.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.560]  He was iconic.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.480]  He wore two Rolexes on his arm.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.480]  Who else does that?
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.680]  You know, to see a communist actually go out and fight himself.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.880]  I mean, I'll give it to Castro, you know, he was a great speaker.
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.000]  He was a good looking guy.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.800]  He was a prolific reader.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.640]  He also tortured and murdered over 200,000 of his own people and imprisoned millions
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.200]  and lived like a king while this was all happening.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.200]  He was a dirtbag.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:03.240]  Now, on the pile of crap that is communism, he was, you know, one of the smaller, smaller
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:10.640]  piles of crap, but what do you think Roger Stokes talking to?
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:13.920]  I know it was calling him in the last 20 minutes of the show.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.720]  He had to go in the call came five minutes early.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.720]  I know I'll get to hear about it after the show ends.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.720]  Not bragging.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.720]  It's just weird inside baseball.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:24.720]  I wouldn't care if it was some globalists he was talking to, but if he's talking to
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.640]  a real deal, that's something different, isn't it?
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:34.320]  So Castro, U.S. thorn inside 50 years who survived 638 assassination attempts.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.080]  They admit they tried to kill him at least 15 times.
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.960]  I don't know if it's 638.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.880]  That's getting a little ridiculous.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:43.480]  Inside Fidel Castro's life of luxury and ladies while country starved.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.640]  Well, at least it wasn't little kids.
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.640]  That's the New York Post.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:52.160]  I'm not defending him, but Cuban communist icon for El Castro dead at 90.
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.160]  Right.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.160]  Mark got it right.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.160]  He was an icon.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:02.160]  One good thing about Fidel is the Che Guevara who's the communist poster boy was there in
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:08.160]  the late 60s and talking crap about poor people and how stupid they were and how people that
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:13.720]  were part black weren't humans and how the Mesoamericans were quote cockroaches and reportedly
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.960]  Phil Castro backhanded him and broke his nose and said, that's the end.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.880]  Get the hell out of the country.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:26.440]  I mean, Che Guevara was a piece of crap, folks.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.440]  He wrote books.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.440]  You can pull them up.
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:34.040]  There's screenshots in Spanish talking about how my attas are retarded and dumb and how
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:38.520]  the damn Mexicans wouldn't get behind what he was doing because they were too stupid.
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.520]  You know, and all this crap.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:46.040]  I mean, he was a real racist folks and you know, here's my complaint whites now demographically
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:50.880]  are the 16th most unsuccessful group with only blacks behind us.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.240]  I feel bad for blacks being one of the most unsuccessful demographic groups.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:57.360]  Native Americans are number 18 behind blacks.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.360]  They're the most unsuccessful.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.360]  I'm part Native American.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:00.520]  I feel sad for that.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:05.440]  I'm not pissing on people to say that, but man to constantly hear how I'm running things
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:13.120]  and how and how I'm screwing everyone over when the Chinese and the Indians and the well,
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:20.120]  they're like two and three, who's number one, the Lebanese, you know, everybody, oh, Lebanese
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:23.360]  privilege or Chinese privilege or Indian privilege.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.680]  These people work 20 hours a day.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.840]  They save their money for decades.
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.640]  They live 10 people to a house with already millionaires to buy as much as they can.
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:35.880]  I'm just sick of hearing that I'm a bad person.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:40.080]  Are there a bunch of white people living off their grandparents' wealth?
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080]  Yeah.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.920]  But I watched the decline of white people.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.360]  Let me give you the decline of white people.
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.480]  White people don't have kids, man.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:47.480]  You're not having kids.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:48.480]  You're dead.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480]  And I'm not bashing white folks.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:53.320]  I'm just sick of hearing how we're the problem all day and I've got all the demographic
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.320]  numbers.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.320]  We'll be back.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.320]  Stay with us.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:02.360]  Introducing vitamin mineral fusion from infowarslifes.com.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.360]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful

[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:29.120]  Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:34.480]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.800]  and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:43.180]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.

[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.360]  quality lab standard.

[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:52.800]  That means it's pure.
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:55.840]  That's infowarslifes.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:57.680]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:58.680]  Hey, everyone.
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:02.560]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.800]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:07.080]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:11.680]  Spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:12.680]  this country.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.160]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.440]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.080]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:26.240]  If you are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.200]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:34.760]  nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting

[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:46.320]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.760]  Head over to infowarsteam.com.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.640]  Your body will be very grateful.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.760]  On the web at infowarsteam.com.
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:45:05.280]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.280]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:09.360]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:14.480]  devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.240]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:21.920]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.480]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.920]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:34.360]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:40.160]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.760]  ever concerning iodine.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.720]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:48.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.320]  any optimum health regimen, stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at InfowarsLife.com, or by
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:58.520]  calling 888-253-3139.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.400]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:02.440]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:05.320]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:11.360]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:16.320]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:21.240]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.360]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.120]  you can to purify your air.
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:33.120]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:36.120]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.320]  The general public doesn't.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:42.280]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:45.880]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:49.440]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:52.640]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:47:02.760]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, and then fullwarstore.com.
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:20.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:26.880]  Okay, so I have told folks with a Trump operation, not Trump, that over a week and a half ago
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.800]  I said, look, they're starting recounts.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.800]  They're saying that you didn't win a popular vote.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:32.840]  They're going to come after you.
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:35.800]  More than 3 million illegals voted, more than 3 million dead people voted.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.200]  It's like 7 million, you add it all together.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.600]  That's admitted, even mainstream news.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:43.520]  You've lost by 2 million, they're claiming.
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:47.520]  Even in states that don't have electronic voting, they're putting out fake numbers like
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.400]  Michigan, you need to watch out.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.400]  This is real.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.400]  Like, oh, we won.
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:52.400]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:57.240]  Well, now Trump knows it's serious, because they mean businesses, he's 54 days out.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.240]  They can stage false flags, race riots.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.120]  I mean, they are pulling out all the stops, people.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.480]  They know Trump's for real.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.560]  Things are more crazy now than they were.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.560]  We're actually winning.
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.200]  I didn't even know this happened.
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.760]  He tweeted about an hour ago, Kit Daniels has written about it.
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:16.720]  We're going to add two videos I shot a few days ago, but also a few weeks ago, where
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:20.800]  I said, Trump won the popular vote.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.480]  And now Trump's come out and pointed that out.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:25.800]  Trump, I won popular vote if illegal voters excluded.
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:27.240]  That's on infowars.com.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.480]  We need maximum coverage of this article.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:35.960]  President-elect Donald Trump had this to say in response to the ongoing Democratic push
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:39.880]  for an election recount, limits to only states.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:40.880]  Trump won.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:41.880]  Yeah.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:42.880]  Again, only the states he won.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.280]  And he went on to break down that all the illegals, dead people voted, and if you count
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:49.360]  them out, he won by six, seven million votes.
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:51.720]  Take two million out, he won by five million votes.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:52.720]  That's up on infowars.com.
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.640]  We're going to add these two videos that I shot on Monday.
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:58.640]  There they are.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:03.240]  Proof Donald Trump won the popular vote and proof Donald Trump won popular vote.
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:06.240]  Dem's trying to oversee overturn election.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:10.800]  And what happened is I shoot a tape feed, just so I can add documentation, and also
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:15.520]  shoot a live feed of the tape feed.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:16.760]  One's got 100,000 views.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:18.400]  One's got a quarter million views.
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:23.120]  These things need 10 million views to counter the globalists.
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.120]  So there you go.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:28.720]  I haven't even gotten into where Julian Assange is and how suspicious this all is.
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.840]  WikiLeaks admit he's on house arrest now.
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:33.240]  They basically got him locked up.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.800]  They're at that South American embassy in London.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:40.640]  So all that's coming up tomorrow, 11 a.m. central time.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:44.680]  But this article, Trump, I won popular vote to be legal.
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:45.680]  Voters excluded.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.600]  That is exactly what happened.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:53.200]  And then you had, you know what, let's add the Bev Harris interview November 9th where
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.640]  she broke down that Hillary tried to steal an election but failed.
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.840]  I should probably change the headline because it was like Hillary stole five states but
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.240]  Trump still won.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.560]  But let's add that video too because this is key intel for Trump and his people.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.840]  They have got to get ahead of this.
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.760]  They're trying to delegitimize folks.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.920]  One of the biggest landslides ever, Hillary, was involved in fraud everywhere.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.880]  Bev Harris is a big liberal.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.680]  She only tells the truth, folks.
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:20.320]  She's exposed Republicans crap over and over and over again.
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.160]  And she came on my show the day after and she said, look at all these anomalies.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:28.520]  Five states where, you know, it was very close margins, a hundred percent in some areas voting
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.520]  for Hillary.
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.520]  That's BS, folks.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.400]  And it's all late at night, right when they're trying to stuff everything.
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:39.440]  They tried the same thing in the battleground state she lost but his tsunami victory was
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:41.920]  so big they failed.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:45.800]  Man, that's amazing, so that's uponem4wars.com.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:48.000]  Let's get this article out to everybody.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  This is big news.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.360]  Well, let's go to drudgerport.com because he's got the headline.
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.000]  She's back.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.480]  Globals were just plotting a week ago for their survival now.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.480]  She's back.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:02.480]  Looks like, you know, she's dying but it's okay.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:08.720]  She's back in the recount, something she said she'd ever do because there's no such thing.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:16.440]  She is back, ladies and gentlemen, with a vengeance.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:21.560]  Never going to stop like the energizer bunny, the gift like herpes that just keeps on giving.
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.640]  Clinton campaign will participate in Wisconsin recount with an eye on outside interference.
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:28.600]  Lawyers say, I told you, the Russians did it.
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:30.680]  That's why they can barely run their own country.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:34.840]  They got sorrows trying to collapse them but the Russians was in the New York Times when
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:39.040]  m4wars was run by the Russians, boy, I sure wish they were running things.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.040]  Where's the paycheck?
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.040]  Where's the money?
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.680]  I got to go out and figure out how to raise it with great products.
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.680]  It's still hard.
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:49.600]  By the way, we end the free shipping with promo code free at checkout, m4warsstore.com,

[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.480]  is key to the fight.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:24.880]  I want to salute and thank all of you who aren't just watching football tonight but are
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:27.560]  tuned in, actually caring about freedom.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:30.160]  I want to thank our crew, our affiliates, everybody.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:31.160]  You're amazing.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:41.240]  Speaking of amazing, I was sitting there on Thanksgiving evening, thinking about Donald
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:46.920]  Trump and his wild card, his Trump card of exposing government-sponsored terror and how
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:49.920]  the Republicans and Democrats worked with the Saudis on 9-11 knowing I've talked to
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:53.840]  congressmen and women and black ops commanders and others about what's in the 28 pages, they've
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:57.120]  said what's in it that our government stood down on 9-11, well FBI agents said that at
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:58.600]  the time, they were in the newspapers.
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:03.720]  Well, I thought the FBI's corrupt, no, their agents on average aren't but the top is.
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:08.280]  This all came out in the news, folks, I was on the radio then, I covered it every day.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:15.760]  And then out of Fox 9 that is in New Jersey and New York, the top station, Trump on 9-11
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.080]  said there had to be bombs in those buildings.
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:22.640]  If he was an insider, folks, the word had gone out to cover up the bombs.
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:25.920]  The firefighters exposed it, the police exposed it, I've interviewed firefighters, police,
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:30.040]  I've interviewed a deputy police chief, I've interviewed a deputy fire chief, Leigh Ann
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:36.240]  has as well, one of her interviews has 6 million views, look it up for yourself.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:39.960]  So it's a big deal to have him doing this, it just signifies how independent he is and
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:44.920]  how he's his own man and why that pisses them off so much and why that scares them.
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:51.160]  So here's Donald Trump on bombs inside Tower One and Tower Two on September 11th, 2001.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:54:00.520]  Donald, you're probably the best known builder, particularly of great buildings in the city.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:05.880]  There's a great deal of question about whether or not the damage and the ultimate destruction
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:10.800]  of the buildings was caused by the airplanes, by architectural defect or possibly by bombs
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.800]  or aftershocks.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:12.800]  Do you have any thoughts on that?
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:13.800]  Well, it wasn't architectural defect.
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:14.800]  The World Trade Center was always known as a very, very strong building.
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:15.800]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb at the basement.
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:16.800]  Now, the basement is the biggest building in the world.
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:23.800]  And I got to see that area about three or four days after it took place because one
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:34.000]  of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour because he did the building.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.520]  And I said, I can't believe it, the building was standing solid and half of the columns
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:39.520]  were blown out.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.520]  I mean, so this was an unbelievably powerful building.
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:46.240]  If you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:47.240]  from the outside.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:51.360]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows is that in between
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:55.240]  all the windows, you had the steel on the outside, the industry on the outside of the
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.240]  building.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:00.080]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams, when I first looked at
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:05.160]  it, I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel, and this is steel that
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:08.280]  was, you remember the width of the windows in the World Trade Center, folks.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:13.200]  I think, you know, if you ever up there, they were quite narrow and in between was this
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:14.200]  heavy steel.
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:20.600]  And how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or 747 or whatever it might have been,
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:22.600]  how could it possibly go through the steel?
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.400]  I happened to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.640]  almost simultaneously because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:31.640]  that wall.
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:35.040]  Most buildings are built with the steels on the inside around the elevator shaft.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:39.200]  This one was built from the outside, which is the strongest structure you can have, and
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.200]  it was almost just like a can of soup.
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.080]  In Alabama, we were looking at pictures all morning long of that plane coming into building
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:54.200]  number two, and when you see that, approach the far side, and then all of a sudden, within
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:58.600]  a matter of millisecond, the explosion pops out the other side.
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:01.400]  I just think that there was a plane with more than just fuel.
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:06.280]  I think, obviously, there were very big planes that were going very rapidly because I was
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:10.280]  also watching where the planes seemed to be not only going.
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:13.040]  The full thing is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:16.640]  By the way, I would just send a tweet by one of our crew members, Matt Taibbi, who told
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:20.480]  us the Federal Reserve was private and won a bunch of prizes, told us big bags were
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:22.520]  reading the stock market and interest rates.
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:27.400]  Oh my God, they told us Matt Taibbi, Rolling Stone, oh my God, I'm like hundreds of times
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:31.760]  bigger than you on the Internet, according to Quantcast and others.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:36.840]  Oh, but Matt Taibbi is so celebrated, he's come out with all his tweets.
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:39.520]  I guess he's got a new payroll boss.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:44.120]  He says, Alex Jones thinks juke's boxes make frogs gay.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:48.600]  No, I talked about a new scientist article about the chemicals in the plastic making
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:51.120]  humans asexual and screwing up reproductive stuff.
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:53.920]  But just say about juke's boxes and make us gay.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:59.240]  Yes, Jones really scooped us on the government sending tornado-steering weapons.
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:00.960]  Never said that, made up.
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:03.320]  Lady Collins said, could this tornado be steered?
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:08.640]  And I said, whether a channel admits weather weapons, but no, not tornadoes, why?
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:12.680]  But Trump also wants, and he goes on to say, in the tweet I saw, that we're going to have
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:14.880]  four years of Alex Jones in the White House.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:20.200]  This is another butt-hurst lap, here it is, congratulations America, you've turned the
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.400]  presidency into four-year Alex Jones broadcast.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:29.640]  The arrogance of these people, make up whatever you want, jackass, our audience is hundreds
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:35.240]  of times bigger than you bucktooth, you damn arrogant son of a bitch, you think just because
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:37.480]  you run around all arrogant means you run the world.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:41.720]  All men just showed up, get ready for it, you're going to have a real problem with it.
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:45.720]  Listeners, I love you, spread the word in fourwars.com, they hate it, spread that link.
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:58:08.920]  We'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
