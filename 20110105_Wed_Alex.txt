[00:00.000 --> 00:12.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.760 --> 00:21.200]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.200 --> 00:37.280]  jones
[00:37.280 --> 00:41.720]  on into twenty twelve that's right sunday monday tuesday and now it is
[00:41.720 --> 00:47.160]  wednesday the kickoff the fifth day of january twenty eleven we're gonna be live
[00:47.160 --> 00:51.880]  here for the next three hours maybe longer we have dr. nick baggage always
[00:51.880 --> 00:57.000]  informative his brother also u.s. senator will be joining us baggage for
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.280]  many years and talking about harp and weather modification and other secretive
[01:02.280 --> 01:06.280]  programs now more and more of what he covered two decades ago and wrote
[01:06.280 --> 01:12.400]  seminal works on from deep research of the u.s. patent office is now a public
[01:12.400 --> 01:16.480]  information so we'll go even further today we'll look into tesla technologies
[01:16.480 --> 01:22.300]  you name it and tie it in to the blackbirds and all the other big fish
[01:22.300 --> 01:25.880]  die-offs happening not just here but around the world mass birds and fish
[01:25.880 --> 01:30.160]  die-offs go global spark in times panic i do not believe that's what's
[01:30.160 --> 01:35.000]  happening here and there could be some type of plausible reason this is
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.080]  happening but it's the liquefaction of their innards many of these birds when
[01:39.080 --> 01:42.840]  they hit the ground on the snow or on the concrete there's a pool of blood
[01:42.840 --> 01:46.720]  around them i mean they have been turned into liquid and and to say that
[01:46.720 --> 01:50.280]  fireworks scared them and they ran into each other and did this i've shot
[01:50.280 --> 01:58.880]  similar sized birds with shotguns and again bird hunting doves quail and they
[01:58.880 --> 02:02.040]  get hit by two or three of the bbs of the hundred or so bbs that go out the end
[02:02.040 --> 02:06.000]  of the shotgun they just shoot little holes in them nothing gets pulverized
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.560]  nothing gets liquefied in fact there's usually hardly any blood they die so
[02:10.560 --> 02:14.680]  quickly and then it makes doing delicious eating don't criticize me for
[02:14.680 --> 02:17.920]  hunting folks if you eat any type of meat i know you don't want to see the
[02:17.920 --> 02:20.480]  chicken that lives in a cage being tortured to death you don't want to
[02:20.480 --> 02:24.560]  actually learn how to butcher a deer like the old timers you have to take a
[02:24.560 --> 02:28.840]  chicken out back and cut its head off instantly you know dying and then pull
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.320]  its feathers but but that's a side issue i'm only getting into my experience
[02:33.320 --> 02:41.840]  with shooting birds of similar size and anatomy to tell you birds don't fall out
[02:41.840 --> 02:46.160]  of trees and then have their insides liquefied okay that that's not birds
[02:46.160 --> 02:51.080]  running into each other i've several times been out at my grandmother's house
[02:51.080 --> 02:56.320]  and she had has big glass windows the house is still there she died about six
[02:56.320 --> 03:03.880]  years ago and you will occasionally see a game bird like a dove fly into the
[03:03.880 --> 03:07.960]  window and break its neck at high speed boom you go out get it go ahead and
[03:07.960 --> 03:14.600]  cook it up it's not really a meal but a snack and if there's no blood okay
[03:14.600 --> 03:20.600]  there's no blood i will assure you birds don't turn into little blood bags and
[03:20.600 --> 03:24.880]  just fall from the sky so something's going on here and i want to get to the
[03:24.880 --> 03:29.560]  bottom of it okay and we'll get into all the big developments on that front
[03:29.560 --> 03:33.400]  mike Adams asked the question as well we have his article up on info wars
[03:33.400 --> 03:37.000]  dot com prison punnet dot com why are the animals dying birds fish wiped out in

[08:33.960 --> 08:40.720]  day of January 2011 Dr. Nick baggage getting into Tesla technology the massive
[08:40.720 --> 08:46.200]  increase in earthquakes worldwide the bird deaths and a big mainstream news
[08:46.200 --> 08:51.040]  admissions of governments all over the world setting up heart type antenna
[08:51.040 --> 08:56.440]  arrays and manipulating the weather now this has been public for decades but if
[08:56.440 --> 09:01.640]  you talk about it the general population out there had never heard of it so they
[09:01.640 --> 09:06.560]  were conditioned to laugh at you it was public in the patents in the government
[09:06.560 --> 09:18.760]  documents but was not reported on by ABC 90 news or the New York Times so things
[09:18.760 --> 09:24.320]  like that were relegated to the X files the documents are real but they stick it
[09:24.320 --> 09:29.040]  in the X files show and mix it in with stories about Chewbacca brothers and hope
[09:29.040 --> 09:37.400]  that that discredits everything that's been the establishment tack but more and
[09:37.400 --> 09:41.520]  more of this information is coming out and we know that the main focus has been
[09:41.520 --> 09:46.000]  weather weapons by governments not just our so-called arm of the New World Order
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.440]  known as the United States government but other arms of it so we're gonna be
[09:49.440 --> 09:54.400]  discussing that with Dr. Nick baggage coming up in the next hour another big
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.720]  story I want to get into leaked document EPA knowingly approved be killing
[09:59.720 --> 10:06.080]  pesticide and it's been leaked my EPA insiders the EPA admits that the
[10:06.080 --> 10:09.320]  document is real they're very upset about it that's why they are trying to use
[10:09.320 --> 10:13.880]  the WikiLeaks fiasco as a precedent to basically throw people in prison for
[10:13.880 --> 10:18.600]  life if they leak any type of government documents that way the government can
[10:18.600 --> 10:24.040]  just basically kill everything and everybody and get away with it but a
[10:24.040 --> 10:28.600]  big report there out of natural news up on prison planet calm and info wars
[10:28.600 --> 10:33.400]  calm very important and that integrates in with mass bird and fish die offs go
[10:33.400 --> 10:37.800]  global spark end times panic we're gonna be discussing that I do not believe this
[10:37.800 --> 10:41.400]  is the end times I do not believe it's the end of the world but the media is
[10:41.400 --> 10:47.680]  gonna hype that ahead of the 2012 so that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that
[10:47.680 --> 10:52.080]  it's religious that we're going into a depression that it's religious that the
[10:52.080 --> 10:55.920]  resources are going to be more and more restricted so that people see it as a
[10:55.920 --> 11:01.920]  foregone conclusion and don't resist and as the weather weapons are used on us
[11:01.920 --> 11:07.000]  and as more and more the wildlife dies they can tell us that it's all our fault
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.040]  and acquiesce to the global government and do whatever it says for the new
[11:11.040 --> 11:16.560]  green religion and that everything will be okay that's basically what 2012 is
[11:16.560 --> 11:21.960]  all about and we're going to be breaking it down today separately another
[11:21.960 --> 11:26.600]  little tidbit of news here florida professor arrested for having a
[11:26.600 --> 11:36.120]  suspicious bagel on a plane that's the MSNBC headline passenger claim man had
[11:36.120 --> 11:41.440]  suspicious package and they overhead compartment it was a bagel and I've seen
[11:41.440 --> 11:47.000]  comedians movie stars you name it reading you know best-selling books about
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.840]  jihadist and passengers see an image of a person you know wearing a desert garb
[11:52.840 --> 11:58.200]  on a book and see an Anglo reading it and the plane is landed and the people
[11:58.200 --> 12:01.640]  are pulled off that's just how the globalist wants you just the wicked
[12:01.640 --> 12:07.000]  fling when none pursueth collapsing in fear from things that are non-existent
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  or that you have a better chance of being struck by lightning than dying from
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.680]  terrorism even if you believe it's all real I mean it through the movies the
[12:14.680 --> 12:19.200]  culture the hundreds of TV shows about terrorist attacking and how they're
[12:19.200 --> 12:25.240]  everywhere in these plots of the heroic CIA and FBI agents torturing people and
[12:25.240 --> 12:30.440]  other things to stop the bad guys the average person out there at least was in
[12:30.440 --> 12:36.960]  years past shaking in fear just five six years ago the number one pole you know
[12:36.960 --> 12:40.280]  the number one threat that people talked about a national polls was terrorism
[12:40.280 --> 12:44.160]  now it's less than 10% think it's important I mean it's just it's just like
[12:44.160 --> 12:48.320]  getting into it it's like imagining that there's flesh-eating zombies you know
[12:48.320 --> 12:53.480]  out in the countryside you ever taken somebody out camping back in college and
[12:53.480 --> 12:59.680]  things I would I would take girlfriends camping and we go with friends and I knew
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.280]  a lot of girls from the city who would get spooked by just driving through the
[13:03.280 --> 13:07.120]  countryside or spooked at night you know they thought that grizzly bears were
[13:07.120 --> 13:10.760]  gonna come out and eat them and that's because their ancient instincts are to
[13:10.760 --> 13:15.200]  be afraid out in the woods but man's killed everything that's basically
[13:15.200 --> 13:18.880]  dangerous except for rattlesnakes and things but they're never scared of
[13:18.880 --> 13:22.480]  something that's actually a threat it's just scared of the dark and so that's
[13:22.480 --> 13:28.840]  what this national or international mass psychosis is is they just take the
[13:28.840 --> 13:34.680]  instincts of man's fear of the dark and then put a turban or a burka on it and
[13:34.680 --> 13:39.920]  the media can just show you an image of a Muslim in desert garb and everyone
[13:39.920 --> 13:44.560]  just falls down and grobbling in fear and basically soils themselves and begins
[13:44.560 --> 13:49.080]  crying out for men in black uniforms to save them meanwhile it's the men in
[13:49.080 --> 13:55.160]  black uniforms financing in almost every case the Muslim extremist so that of
[13:55.160 --> 13:59.960]  course is a major issue Florida professor arrested for having a
[13:59.960 --> 14:05.240]  suspicious bagel bagels are without kind of now passengers claim man had
[14:05.240 --> 14:09.600]  suspicious package in the overhead compartment so if you see something say
[14:09.600 --> 14:13.160]  something and we now have confirmed the walmarts all over the country are
[14:13.160 --> 14:17.040]  beginning to phase in telescreens at every checkout counter and then some
[14:17.040 --> 14:20.880]  big giant ones at the back of walmart with government announcements watch
[14:20.880 --> 14:25.200]  everyone oh my gosh you're under danger and this will intensify the paranoid's
[14:25.200 --> 14:31.280]  out there to just run around in fear looking around corners and and creeping
[14:31.280 --> 14:36.360]  through the clothing aisles and the auto parts area just looking under every
[14:36.360 --> 14:42.160]  can of Folger's coffee for a deadly al-qaeda and so suddenly as part of
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.880]  this mass hallucination that's in forced by the media and the thousands of
[14:45.880 --> 14:49.280]  anti-terror drills where they'll blow up a bus in the middle of the town and
[14:49.280 --> 14:53.080]  announced for a few hours terrorist have hit and they'll lock down the schools
[14:53.080 --> 14:57.240]  this happens just right up in Belton close to where I live just north of me
[14:57.240 --> 15:01.040]  I got word about one and went to the drill they blew up a car and blew up
[15:01.040 --> 15:04.480]  some stuff and the mayor announced terrorists were hitting and it was even
[15:04.480 --> 15:08.680]  the paper the next day the terrorist had hit but in the last paragraph of a long
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.120]  half-page story it said by the way it was just a drill so it hits people with
[15:14.120 --> 15:18.760]  suspended disbelief that al-caeda has hit him and hit him hard so that then a
[15:18.760 --> 15:26.360]  few years later they're on a plane and see a guy with a bagel I mean they see
[15:26.360 --> 15:29.600]  that bagel and suddenly it's wearing a turban suddenly it's got a big black
[15:29.600 --> 15:35.760]  beard sesame seeds are seen as as legions of al-qaeda forces meanwhile all
[15:35.760 --> 15:41.080]  sorts of tyranny death mass murder bad drug interactions flesh-eating bacteria
[15:41.080 --> 15:45.400]  from overuse of antibiotics a massive plague all over the country deaths just
[15:45.400 --> 15:50.640]  all over the place rocket attacks truck bombs machine gunning deaths police and
[15:50.640 --> 15:56.000]  media being killed on the US border 28,000 deaths and growing dogs and cats
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.680]  raining you know out of the sky basically and that's no issue no problem
[16:00.680 --> 16:07.800]  nothing out of sight out of mind but a bagel can now like a mirage just morph
[16:07.800 --> 16:15.200]  into some type of deadly Gorgon a Florida professor was arrested and
[16:15.200 --> 16:23.880]  removed from a plane Monday good notice he was arrested not just that well you
[16:23.880 --> 16:27.520]  never can be too safe about the terrorist and then you go well in every
[16:27.520 --> 16:31.080]  case we study the government's protecting them and funding them and
[16:31.080 --> 16:35.280]  their commanders Muslim extremists are always secretly hanging out at the
[16:35.280 --> 16:38.720]  Pentagon and military bases here it's all confirmed oh let's just not look at
[16:38.720 --> 16:45.720]  that isn't it much more fun to be scared of the bagel so again just just be glad
[16:45.720 --> 16:49.680]  a Florida professor was arrested removed from a plane Monday after his
[16:49.680 --> 16:55.320]  fellow passengers and see government like attack dogs have been trained the
[16:55.320 --> 16:59.040]  most ridiculous phone call the most ridiculous warning they hyperventilate
[16:59.040 --> 17:03.960]  over all of that and get all upset but when I call the FBI threat fusion center
[17:03.960 --> 17:09.600]  that Janet Napolitano is you know handing out nationwide at universities and
[17:09.600 --> 17:12.920]  high schools and government buildings and private corporations if you see
[17:12.920 --> 17:16.960]  anything suspicious or have any tips about terrorism call and so I call and

[17:21.120 --> 17:25.600]  operationally and we're all a walkie is in every case admittedly hanging out
[17:25.600 --> 17:29.480]  secretly at the Pentagon and then commanding the Fort Hood attack the
[17:29.480 --> 17:33.600]  underwear bomber the shoe bomber and I'd like to send you this and the guys
[17:33.600 --> 17:38.640]  just like click and hangs up so you give them a real terror threat I mean you
[17:38.640 --> 17:41.920]  tell them right where the terrorists are and exactly what's going on and
[17:41.920 --> 17:46.640]  admitted fact and they just don't want to hear it but if you say a bagel scary
[17:46.640 --> 17:53.600]  people are going to jail just like every week I see articles sometimes even more
[17:53.600 --> 17:57.280]  where neighbors are walking through generally through some suburb middle
[17:57.280 --> 18:01.240]  class area it's almost always an old man who thinks they're still in America
[18:01.240 --> 18:05.840]  who's in their tanker and garage cleaning a rifle neighbor sees it they
[18:05.840 --> 18:09.440]  call the SWAT team the old man's lucky if he makes it out alive sometimes they
[18:09.440 --> 18:12.560]  run up and just shoot them right there on the spot or they're holding a garden
[18:12.560 --> 18:16.160]  hose watering now the end of it looks like a gun barrel police come and kill
[18:16.160 --> 18:21.480]  them San Francisco and it's always the same MO or a carpet cleaners in your
[18:21.480 --> 18:27.160]  house or the cable guy and sees a gun case and calls the police and says your
[18:27.160 --> 18:30.440]  shotguns a machine gun and they show up and a lot of times they go ahead and
[18:30.440 --> 18:33.920]  confiscate the guns well you got eight guns and we found two thousand rounds of
[18:33.920 --> 18:37.120]  ammo and the local police spokesman will go out and have a press conference say
[18:37.120 --> 18:41.360]  we have arrested mr. Johnson he had an arsenal and then people say is there a
[18:41.360 --> 18:48.760]  law against those the press never asked that they just sit there and you'll
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.040]  hear the radio announcers and the local TV news people they always have like that
[18:52.040 --> 18:56.280]  happy sounding announcer going mr. Johnson was taking into custody by
[18:56.280 --> 19:00.280]  police officers I heard him last night on the radio announcing oh they're trying
[19:00.280 --> 19:04.040]  to pass a law in Texas that if you've ever had a DWI it'll be marked on your
[19:04.040 --> 19:08.160]  license isn't that good and they had so much enjoyment talking about the police

[24:21.600 --> 24:27.000]  patrol the next few weeks that the 2000 National Guard who are on the border are
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.080]  not allowed to talk to anybody, interdict to anyone they must sit in one
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.760]  spot driving white trucks where everyone can see them and it's a big joke with the
[24:37.760 --> 24:42.360]  smugglers and there's more news on that today where even high school kids can
[24:42.360 --> 24:46.720]  just walk back and forth on both sides of the border of the fence they were
[24:46.720 --> 24:51.520]  gonna build they only built a few miles of it with giant holes in it and Reuters
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.680]  and Fox did report two years ago the illegal aliens were hired to build the
[24:55.680 --> 25:00.160]  fence so this is a complete joke it's also been reported the illegal aliens
[25:00.160 --> 25:04.840]  when they are arrested in the few staged raids they have every year of meat
[25:04.840 --> 25:08.640]  packing plants and other things that that ice then takes them and gives them

[25:13.240 --> 25:17.600]  total stunts they arrest them they apologize and they give them a job I
[25:17.600 --> 25:23.640]  mean it's just all completely staged okay that's wide open but then they've
[25:23.640 --> 25:27.280]  got to absolutely stick their hands down your pants they've got to arrest you
[25:27.280 --> 25:30.960]  for the bagel they've got to do all they've got to spend tens of billions
[25:30.960 --> 25:35.120]  of dollars putting in threat fusion centers and federalizing all the police
[25:35.120 --> 25:39.840]  and 2 billion in New York and more than 2 billion in Boston and a billion plus in

[25:49.800 --> 25:53.120]  Homeland Security from the last administration and the current
[25:53.120 --> 25:56.400]  administration are getting the money from it and they're training police that
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.040]  domestic groups militias conservatives are going to kill police any minute and
[26:02.040 --> 26:07.960]  attack all the police stations now the public's told that all of this police

[33:15.320 --> 33:28.400]  radio network initiate implosion of the economy acceleration of world
[33:28.400 --> 33:36.200]  government as solution deploy George solos to attack opposition and Ron Paul
[33:36.200 --> 33:50.400]  Alex Jones and others why do you think I'm broke if there's a new way I'll be
[33:50.400 --> 34:09.720]  the first in line the first in line I didn't know you had any feelings good to
[34:09.720 --> 34:13.240]  know old Dave Mustaine as a Christian and is on board to fight against the New
[34:13.240 --> 34:16.840]  World Order and to know that Muse is on board to fight against the New World
[34:16.840 --> 34:23.800]  Order big supporters the show we salute them why I hit somebody out there I know
[34:23.800 --> 34:28.520]  Bob Dylan's doesn't like the New World Order I know so many other people don't
[34:28.520 --> 34:33.400]  like the New World Order our own Jimmy Vaughan right here in Austin Tejas he
[34:33.400 --> 34:41.480]  doesn't like it either I'll be the first in line okay we are back live getting
[34:41.480 --> 34:44.960]  serious here you know I'm thinking about why I've been goofing off a little bit
[34:44.960 --> 34:47.760]  more in the show I'm gonna be quite honest I've analyzed
[34:47.760 --> 34:52.040]  psychoanalyzed my own psychological condition and that's one of them hard
[34:52.040 --> 34:55.440]  core realist a hard charger who believes in liberty and knows the power of the
[34:55.440 --> 35:04.280]  individual a dynamic spirit of humanity highly motivated but all working no
[35:04.280 --> 35:08.960]  play mix jack no boy and I've got to have a little fun sometimes here they
[35:08.960 --> 35:14.160]  call it gallows humor and that's what it is I do all the research analyze late
[35:14.160 --> 35:17.520]  into the night hours of research this morning and then I get in here with the
[35:17.520 --> 35:23.240]  stacks of news and it is a paradox that I then don't want to go back over it
[35:23.240 --> 35:31.480]  again it is a paradox I don't want to have to cover when I'm about to cover it
[35:31.480 --> 35:37.080]  is kind of like a dog revisiting his vomit but I have to I have to because
[35:37.080 --> 35:41.040]  we got to cover it we got to resist it and admitting the tyranny admitting the
[35:41.040 --> 35:47.040]  problem is half the solution then overcoming the problem and restoring
[35:47.040 --> 35:53.520]  liberty is the full solution in that eloquent equation okay let's get into
[35:53.520 --> 36:00.720]  associated present let's get into the hardcore news World Bank issues its first
[36:00.720 --> 36:10.160]  yawn bonds in Hong Kong now before I get into this AP article I want to lay
[36:10.160 --> 36:13.600]  this out a little bit just again it would not do justice to just read that
[36:13.600 --> 36:19.920]  one headline for those that may not know a month ago the oruse keys and the
[36:19.920 --> 36:29.240]  chai comms made a deal that they were not going to engage in any trade between
[36:29.240 --> 36:33.760]  their two nations in the World Reserve currency the dollar and when they
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.240]  announced that and then went ahead with it two weeks later now two weeks ago it
[36:38.240 --> 36:45.440]  fired one of the biggest fattest longest black nails into the lid of the coffin
[36:45.440 --> 36:49.520]  and the corpse that is the dollar now the globalist have always planned this the
[36:49.520 --> 36:53.640]  trilaterals back in the 70s talked about how they do it they will also destroy
[36:53.640 --> 36:58.640]  the other currencies later and as the dollar sucks down to this vortex this
[36:58.640 --> 37:02.680]  black hole it will then suck in the other currencies with it and will be left
[37:02.680 --> 37:09.280]  with the global sdr backed by a basket of global taxes vat international vat
[37:09.280 --> 37:15.000]  national a raft of carbon taxes the list goes on and on travel taxes you name
[37:15.000 --> 37:24.040]  it security taxes the the proliferation of this in financial and military
[37:24.040 --> 37:30.600]  conquest by the banking board and so now you've seen a rapid scurrying from the
[37:30.600 --> 37:35.640]  dollar and then all the hundred plus 160 plus countries that have invested
[37:35.640 --> 37:39.320]  mailing the dollar as the dollar plunges they then get desperate and go buy
[37:39.320 --> 37:43.240]  more dollars trying to prop it up but now the consensus as you watch the dollar
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.280]  and the aggregate go down over time as George Soros said last year and we
[37:47.280 --> 37:50.040]  aired it here last year for some reason it's getting a bunch of attention now
[37:50.040 --> 37:54.240]  heard it on local talk radio this morning I was on man cow he wanted to talk
[37:54.240 --> 37:59.800]  about it George Soros saying yes it is ideal to have the dollar slowly declined
[37:59.800 --> 38:05.800]  and China replaced the United States as the world consumers it's more of a
[38:05.800 --> 38:09.440]  Henry Kissinger type imitation so that's finally getting attention because
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.920]  yeah a year ago it hadn't quite yet started to unfold now people are
[38:13.920 --> 38:18.880]  thinking it's a new clip since we posted it two days ago it's amazing to watch
[38:18.880 --> 38:23.080]  how more and more this radio show my websites info wars.com and present
[38:23.080 --> 38:29.720]  by the dot com are setting the media agenda we really are beginning to do that
[38:29.720 --> 38:34.000]  similar to what the drudge report does drudge report.com and I was sitting
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.200]  there after I got out of the shower after one for a jog this morning I was
[38:37.200 --> 38:45.280]  looking at myself in the mirror and I'm like I don't like this power I don't
[38:45.280 --> 38:51.560]  it's freaky and I can't imagine a lot of people out there get power and go wild
[38:51.560 --> 38:54.800]  and become very arrogant and self-assured it's the opposite with
[38:54.800 --> 39:07.440]  Alejandro Jones. It makes me think of a line from Full Metal Jacket it's a good
[39:07.440 --> 39:17.320]  thing God gave us so much power to keep heaven stocked with fresh souls but this
[39:17.320 --> 39:23.400]  is real power and I don't want to keep heaven stocked with fresh souls it's
[39:23.400 --> 39:30.720]  weird I I don't feel worthy I'm not worthy to have this much power and watch
[39:30.720 --> 39:35.400]  the power growing and I really am gonna try to focus and take it to the next
[39:35.400 --> 39:43.520]  level but it is creepy I have to tell you very creepy pretty much anything we
[39:43.520 --> 39:46.920]  cover or push now but enters the news cycle and becomes a major news story
[39:46.920 --> 39:49.960]  we've hit the zeitgeist and I mean I don't just hit the it's like hitting a
[39:49.960 --> 39:56.040]  hole in the hole in one every day you realize the amount of eyes and
[39:56.040 --> 40:01.320]  surveillance and spin coming at us and they may destroy me soon I don't know
[40:01.320 --> 40:05.720]  but if they do that's part of the plan because it's God's plan I'm not worried
[40:05.720 --> 40:10.120]  about it I did my mission I woke people up thanks to you working with us
[40:10.120 --> 40:14.080]  symbiotically to spread the word and they can destroy me individually in my
[40:14.080 --> 40:19.680]  name or whatever they cook up but the detonator has already gone off the
[40:19.680 --> 40:26.080]  chain reaction is already in place and now I'm suddenly seeing a major flux
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.840]  where suddenly there are thousands of sites and individuals that are really
[40:31.840 --> 40:37.760]  getting the deep knowledge and understanding the paradigm shift and I
[40:37.760 --> 40:41.560]  feel like I've completed a lot of my mission now I want to go forward with
[40:41.560 --> 40:48.760]  that but it's a good feeling but it's also very daunting but enough about
[40:48.760 --> 41:00.600]  that I'm just telling you what's on my mind it is bracing it is chilling it's
[41:00.600 --> 41:10.160]  also like a fire in my chest but overall I've had amazing success because I'm
[41:10.160 --> 41:16.000]  real and humans can instinctively communicate when they turn on their
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.480]  discernment when people use it and folks know I'm real that's why the
[41:20.480 --> 41:25.520]  enemy's main drumbeat attack is that I'm not legitimate that I'm not real
[41:25.520 --> 41:33.640]  because they're trying to assail the bonafide legitimacy the genuineness of
[41:33.640 --> 41:43.080]  it oh and I'm genuine warts and all I'm genuine in the boorish appearance I'm
[41:43.080 --> 41:53.200]  genuine and they can't deal with people that are real they can't face it and
[41:53.200 --> 42:03.360]  realism is infectious and the controllers know that we're infecting
[42:03.360 --> 42:08.880]  their minds or to use a better term seducing them with the truth and when
[42:08.880 --> 42:15.840]  you get so close to darkness the light the light for some becomes beautiful and
[42:15.840 --> 42:21.720]  that unknown quantity that unknown country they want to go back to it many
[42:21.720 --> 42:27.800]  of them were born into evil born into conditioning and now as they near the
[42:27.800 --> 42:33.200]  dark flame they can look back across the chasm out of purgatory on their final
[42:33.200 --> 42:39.320]  journey into their own self-made Hades and they could see up on the mountain
[42:39.320 --> 42:48.920]  top the glowing light of heaven flowing down like living water and they thirst
[42:48.920 --> 42:55.520]  for it well come and drink you want real knowledge you want your mind to be so
[42:55.520 --> 43:00.320]  fulfilled that it burns in a trillion fractal designs of understanding and
[43:00.320 --> 43:05.760]  almost limitless discernment as we as the little creations of the great
[43:05.760 --> 43:15.800]  creator glimpse the majesty you think the devil can deliver one one trillionth
[43:15.800 --> 43:20.840]  of what the true creator of the universe can deliver to you you think you
[43:20.840 --> 43:25.280]  found power because you're willing to break the laws of God's creation in
[43:25.280 --> 43:32.000]  nature as a cancer you think the ability to destroy his power it is nothing
[43:32.000 --> 43:45.040]  creation is power the darkness runs from the light the light is unlimited
[43:45.040 --> 43:51.400]  compared to darkness darkness is the absence of light it is the void it is
[43:51.400 --> 43:58.440]  the emptiness all right I'm gonna stop preaching
[43:59.640 --> 44:03.800]  maybe I should take a week off more often every time I leave for a week I
[44:03.800 --> 44:09.720]  get wound up for months World Bank issues its first bonds of the Chinese
[44:09.720 --> 44:15.000]  currency in Hong Kong the World Bank is issuing its first bonds denominated in
[44:15.000 --> 44:27.080]  Chinese Yon in Hong Kong joining a growing number of borrowers tapping the
[44:27.080 --> 44:35.960]  new debt market as Beijing gradually promotes of its tightly controlled
[44:35.960 --> 44:43.680]  currency abroad that's a weird line the World Bank shed buyers of its 500
[44:43.680 --> 44:52.120]  million Yon 76 million dollars two-year bond were mainly Hong Kong based
[44:52.120 --> 44:55.840]  financial institutions companies and wealthy individuals it said the money
[44:55.840 --> 44:59.880]  will go into its general fund rather than being raised for a specific purpose
[44:59.880 --> 45:04.200]  the Chinese currency is not traded on the global currency markets but Beijing
[45:04.200 --> 45:08.160]  has loosened controls and allowed Hong Kong banks to use it Hong Kong is
[45:08.160 --> 45:11.840]  Chinese territory but has its own currency in Western style legal system
[45:11.840 --> 45:16.040]  and often is used as a site for mainland companies to interact with foreign
[45:16.040 --> 45:21.640]  investors yeah the British pretty much rule there as the twin-headed eagle with
[45:21.640 --> 45:26.040]  the chai comes Beijing began allowing foreign companies to issue their
[45:26.040 --> 45:30.040]  currency debt last year the Asian Development Bank Caterpillar Inc and
[45:30.040 --> 45:34.320]  McDonald's group have sold the currency denominated debt to finance
[45:34.320 --> 45:40.680]  activities in China so that is a move away and you notice US bonds aren't as
[45:40.680 --> 45:44.520]  valuable now US based companies aren't as value the premium isn't as value
[45:44.520 --> 45:51.280]  valuable they're definitely moving away from it here is another one World Bank
[45:51.280 --> 45:57.360]  tabs offshore Yon bond market for first time so the World Bank is issuing its
[45:57.360 --> 46:02.720]  first Chinese currency dominated bond so they're now accelerating towards it
[46:02.720 --> 46:06.520]  the move away people are kind of getting up kind of like when a party you see one
[46:06.520 --> 46:09.680]  first group kind of leaves and people kind of see it and then they start to
[46:09.680 --> 46:14.640]  leave and then pretty soon everybody's leaving ever seen blackbirds or ducks or
[46:14.640 --> 46:19.280]  seagulls there could be 500 out there you know eating dead fish or whatever it
[46:19.280 --> 46:23.160]  may be and when one takes off they kind of look and ignore it then two take off
[46:23.160 --> 46:27.280]  and three than five then all sudden they all take off a couple birds have taken
[46:27.280 --> 46:30.760]  off now four or five just took off now the whole group is getting their wings
[46:30.760 --> 46:36.760]  out getting ready to take off the average Americans look in a field games but
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.120]  really great haven't they you guys at gas station counters I'll ask and you're
[46:40.120 --> 46:44.720]  like yeah yeah zombie I wish you could talk about real issues and a guy behind
[46:44.720 --> 46:50.040]  you's like yeah did you see UFC and they're all real concerned it's real
[46:50.040 --> 46:54.240]  important to them as men because that's that tribal war area of their mind that
[46:54.240 --> 46:58.520]  should be reserved for political war and defending their position in life but
[46:58.520 --> 47:02.320]  instead it's just kind of little boys yeah did you see the simulated combat on
[47:02.320 --> 47:07.720]  TV yeah I watched it a bunch of rich gladiators that could care less about me
[47:07.720 --> 47:13.960]  did you see it yeah I'm empty too yeah I did I fill my head with faction figures
[47:13.960 --> 47:16.960]  that don't matter instead of learning the political system and standing up for
[47:16.960 --> 47:22.360]  myself yeah I wonder why women don't respect me I wonder why I'm not
[47:22.360 --> 47:28.160]  successful in business yeah we're all in a rested development isn't it fun let's
[47:28.160 --> 47:31.480]  talk about it to get it I mean if they were having a real discussion that's
[47:31.480 --> 47:35.280]  what it be but instead it's like when you don't want to talk about they go oh
[47:35.280 --> 47:39.280]  you don't know all this and they kind of just look at each other and go all the
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.440]  time I'll be at a restaurant or a grocery store or some event and some guys
[47:43.440 --> 47:47.600]  will come over even people who know who I am they'll go hey Alex or I'll be a you
[47:47.600 --> 47:51.080]  know soccer game with my kids or whatever get I'm not saying sports are
[47:51.080 --> 47:54.960]  bad end of themselves if you're involved in it but not when it's your whole
[47:54.960 --> 47:59.360]  focus and they'll go hey what do you think of the cowboys what do you think
[47:59.360 --> 48:02.800]  what do you think of this and that they'll throw out some statistics and
[48:02.800 --> 48:05.520]  I'll just go I'm not really that interested in they'll just kind of
[48:05.520 --> 48:10.040]  smile each other and go oh and then I mean I'll sit there and listen to grown
[48:10.040 --> 48:15.080]  men in the gym trying to act like they're sportscasters and these elaborate
[48:15.080 --> 48:19.200]  combinations of information and history and what they're predicting and what
[48:19.200 --> 48:22.560]  they're what they're betting on and what they're doing or you'll hear even more
[48:22.560 --> 48:26.400]  pathetic discussions of systems to win lotteries and hey have you heard the
[48:26.400 --> 48:32.160]  mega millions is 200 million hey are you gonna bet on it I mean it's just
[48:32.160 --> 48:35.840]  George Arwell 1984 wrote all about that all they cared about was sports and a
[48:35.840 --> 48:42.000]  lottery in that fictitious police state look we're going to Hades in a giant
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.320]  stinking handbasket okay the blood is running out of the country we're going
[48:47.320 --> 48:53.840]  ash and white we're flatlining and I'm sorry if I can't get all upset and paint
[48:53.840 --> 48:58.960]  myself up like a clown and go to a game and get drunk I'm sorry I'm not a real
[48:58.960 --> 49:07.640]  man I'm sorry okay so laugh at me there's something wrong with me okay I've
[49:07.640 --> 49:11.040]  just predicted everything that was gonna unfold and broken down all the
[49:11.040 --> 49:17.120]  government staging terror attacks that that isn't creepy and I warned you about
[49:17.120 --> 49:20.920]  the flu being dangerous the flu vaccine that's all now come out and been
[49:20.920 --> 49:24.840]  confirmed and the government's training for mass arrest in the US of anyone who
[49:24.840 --> 49:29.640]  criticizes the government I agree with you that's not a problem not when there's
[49:29.640 --> 49:36.800]  global soccer to watch and so to all of those guys that really get it and you
[49:36.800 --> 49:43.160]  know how to basically put on this fake suit of clothes of who they are that's
[49:43.160 --> 49:46.840]  what it is it's like a it's like who they are and they repeat what the news
[49:46.840 --> 49:52.120]  says and what ESPN says and they walk up and you know you're sitting there to
[49:52.120 --> 49:55.960]  bar on a trip waiting for your dinner to come and there's guys come up to you

[54:09.120 --> 54:13.240]  not dr. Nick baggage is joining us at the eight after I want to continue with
[54:13.240 --> 54:20.280]  news here so the pace of moving away from the dollar worldwide is gaining a
[54:20.280 --> 54:24.680]  lot of speed right now and they're moving towards the Chinese currency as an
[54:24.680 --> 54:30.800]  interim balance to that which is already massively devalued in its own right
[54:30.800 --> 54:35.240]  so the message is there is not confidence in the dollar also consumer
[54:35.240 --> 54:41.080]  bankruptcies hits a five-year high in 2010 they now have those numbers out
[54:41.080 --> 54:48.920]  Reuters is reporting that that broke the previous record of 2009 and so the
[54:48.920 --> 54:53.920]  bottom line here is the economy is not in very good shape continuing commodities
[54:53.920 --> 55:01.560]  outlook for 2011 oil above 100 and gold 1500 singing in has interviewed a
[55:01.560 --> 55:05.320]  spectrum of commodities experts and the lion's share of them believe that gold
[55:05.320 --> 55:10.040]  is going to go above $1500 an ounce I think that's very conservative as you
[55:10.040 --> 55:14.160]  notice they can drive it down with paper manipulation for a few days or even a
[55:14.160 --> 55:18.240]  few weeks but it always goes right back up the ten-year graph is going
[55:18.240 --> 55:23.240]  hyperbolic on average investment strategies and money managers are
[55:23.240 --> 55:28.760]  predicting oil prices will rise 4% and global edge up 1% by the end of 2011
[55:28.760 --> 55:33.680]  according to an exclusive CNN money survey commodity prices had a stellar
[55:33.680 --> 55:38.640]  2010 and experts expect that momentum to carry over to the next year and of
[55:38.640 --> 55:43.800]  course they don't tell you till deeper in here that it's dollar devaluation and
[55:43.800 --> 55:49.160]  they say that the recovery is endangered by increased commodity prices the
[55:49.160 --> 55:53.120]  recovery if this is a recovery I certainly don't want to see a recession or
[55:53.120 --> 55:58.040]  depression here's another one world food prices rise to record on sugar meat
[55:58.040 --> 56:03.720]  cost that's out of Bloomberg world food prices we told you this few years ago
[56:03.720 --> 56:09.520]  what happened to a record in December on higher sugar grain and oil seed cost the
[56:09.520 --> 56:14.240]  united nations said exceeding levels reached in 08 that sparked deadly riots
[56:14.240 --> 56:18.440]  from Haiti to Egypt an index of 55 food commodities tracked by the food and
[56:18.440 --> 56:24.760]  agriculture organization gained for a six-month 214.7 points above the
[56:24.760 --> 56:29.680]  previous all-time I have 213.5 in June of 08 again that's global dollar
[56:29.680 --> 56:35.840]  devaluation causing that that's the main contributor but have you noticed
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.360]  since they got rid of Glass-Steagall in the US and similar laws worldwide to
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.360]  create all this counterfeit financial instruments for the bankers to buy
[56:44.360 --> 56:48.160]  everything up they know on the back end of it it'll cause a global meltdown
[56:48.160 --> 56:53.760]  which then they'll be asset-rich they can buy up even more but they also know
[56:53.760 --> 56:56.600]  there's gonna be civil unrest that's why the British Ministry of Defense four
[56:56.600 --> 57:00.920]  years ago that's why the Department of Defense the last two years all they've
[57:00.920 --> 57:05.800]  been doing is gearing up for this and now this year and late last year they
[57:05.800 --> 57:10.080]  make the announcements oh gee we just discovered there's gonna be financial
[57:10.080 --> 57:13.760]  unrest good thing we set up this police state for the Muslims it's really for

[57:30.480 --> 57:34.960]  use it on you good thing we started building this in acceleration 11 years
[57:34.960 --> 57:42.000]  ago when we set it all up this total premeditated continuity of agenda
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.400]  worldwide same programs same uniforms same everything just global financial
[57:47.400 --> 57:52.680]  takeover with a military takeover on the tail end of it as the solution I mean

[58:18.920 --> 58:23.480]  fragile recovery financial times of London oils continue steady climb here's

[58:29.880 --> 58:34.440]  stimulus Fed says oh they've got to keep QE 2 and QE 3 giving themselves
[58:34.440 --> 58:38.680]  trillions they've got to continue that to help you of course you got to pay it

[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:38.360]  recovery not strong enough to ultra stimulus the Federal Reserve says I sleep
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.720]  a lot better knowing the Fed that engineered all this publicly and that
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.280]  it's private won't tell Congress where the trillions went I sleep good knowing
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.160]  they run everything secretly don't you and keep telling us that if we just give
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.160]  them more power and unlimited money they'll fix it all though they want a
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.880]  depression Federal Reserve officials officials not private corporate
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.840]  criminals officials authorities financial veterans Federal Reserve
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:16.480]  officials oh their officials stuck with the pace of their 60 billion Treasury
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:22.800]  bond buying program last month becoming the trillions because the economy
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.080]  wasn't improving fast enough to make a noticeable dent in unemployment minutes
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.680]  of the December meeting show then that's their little public quasi public
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.880]  meeting where they give us a bunch of baloney spending by consumers and
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:44.800]  businesses has improved heading into the final month of 2010 and Congress was on
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.480]  the verge of enacting a tax cut package that would bolster the economy Fed
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.160]  officials said that made them more confident the economic recovery would
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:56.680]  gain momentum according to the minutes of the Fed's closed-door meeting December
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.360]  14th then they go back into the double-talk risk still loomed the minutes
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:06.240]  said particularly a weak housing market and spending cuts and layoffs from state
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:14.640]  and local governments hmm and then Kurt Nemo has an article boiling down why we
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:20.360]  see the oil going up so much on December 16th Lindsey Williams told Alex Jones
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.640]  the price of crude oil would soon hit 150 to 200 per barrel and this would
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:34.440]  translate into gas prices in the range of four to five dollars per gallon
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.840]  Williams an ordained Baptist minister who went to Alaska in 1971 as a
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.160]  missionary was told about the price increases by insiders in the oil
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:50.640]  industry he had befriended and he went through all of his predictions and since
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:56.560]  then crude oil has gone up more than ten dollars and now we've seen head
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.840]  executives at Shell and other places say oh yeah hundred and fifty two hundred
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:10.200]  dollars a barrel by 2012 five dollars plus at the gas pump and there's a
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.800]  really disgusting article I mean the fact senator disgusting by the economic
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:20.440]  collapse blog up on info wars dot com everything is falling apart 20 facts
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.480]  that you will not want to read if you still want to feel good about America's
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.280]  decaying infrastructure and we're not trying to be negative here we're being
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.120]  honest about what's happening so we can stop the policies that have engineered
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:38.400]  this number one one-third of Americans major roads are in poor or mediocre
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:43.320]  condition number two traffic on more than half the miles of interstate
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:49.920]  highways see 70% of capacity and nearly 25% of the miles are strained at more
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.400]  than 95% of capacity number three Americans waste 4.2 billion hours and
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:00.640]  2.8 billion gallons of fuel a year sitting in traffic equally to nearly one
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.520]  full work week and three weeks worth of gas for every traveler number four over
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:11.880]  the next 30 years our nation is expected to grow by 100 million and highway
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.800]  traffic will double again even of the highway capacity grows no faster the
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.120]  next 25 years Americans can expect to spend 160 hours or four work weeks each
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:27.120]  year in traffic by 2035 number five nearly a third of all highway fatalities
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:33.760]  are due to be substandard road conditions obsolete road designs and
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:39.880]  roadside hazards number six over 4095 dams are unsafe and have deficiencies
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.880]  that leave them more susceptible to failure especially during large flood
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:49.240]  events and earthquakes well that's only six points out of the 20 you know in
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.360]  Europe the trains go over 200 miles an hour in Japan close to 300 same thing
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.920]  in China our trains can hardly go 50 miles an hour 100 years ago they were
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.920]  going over a hundred because they've got ancient railways they don't fix

[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.640]  ones food is your only ammunition how much do you want when do you want it
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.920]  now or after the battle starts when will you need it can you buy it without
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.040]  proper identification will there be any food will it make your children sick if
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.600]  there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself will you go to the gathering
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.960]  center and be immunized you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.960]  supply food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life how much
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.520]  will you need we don't know how much do you want all you can get I'm Alex Jones
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:51.880]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day call 1-800-409-5633
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:08:01.000]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.720]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:14.480]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.720]  we're live eight minutes into the second hour of worldwide broadcast Dr. Nick
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.520]  baggage eldest son of late United States congressman from Alaska Nick baggage
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:40.600]  senior his brother is the US senator from Alaska and he's a best-selling
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:48.040]  author of the website is earth pulse.com he heads up the lay group that's
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:53.880]  studying electromagnetic and advanced technologies he's got a long bio he
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:59.200]  really doesn't need any introduction here he's also the author of course of
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:04.360]  angels don't play this harp we're gonna get into Tesla technologies with him
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.200]  which now again more and more mainstream news is admitting is much more
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.520]  advanced than we even know that the FBI confiscated the documents and it's
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.160]  suppressed much of it I want to get into the bees dying the bumblebees four
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:23.320]  species of those more than half of them gone all sorts of bizarre bird die-offs
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.640]  that are going on the government says it isn't pesticides though there is a
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.720]  pesticide sprayed generally in December and January that is restricted in use
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.720]  that only kills blackbirds jaren's in there researching it right now all these
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:42.400]  big fish die-offs the increase in volcanic activity here in the United
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.480]  States we're going to discuss it all with Dr. Nick baggage plus that daily mail
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.200]  article you guys pull that out of the stack the other day we printed it in
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.720]  color admitting that they're putting up harp type technology in Middle Eastern
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.960]  nations causing rainstorms which is what dr. baggage and others have gone over
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.640]  the patents and shown harp and other systems are a big part of so this has
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.760]  always been in the scientific literature if you know how where to look
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.600]  weather modification known as Kim trailing the geoengineering but what
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.200]  has changed is the internet has forced all this out in the open so the mainstream
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.680]  corporate media is playing catch-up dr. Nick baggage great to have you here
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.480]  with us well thanks for having me again Alex and it's always good to be with you
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.080]  especially on on these topics these days so pretty important issues you know
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:35.640]  it's funny we called you Monday and I'd already told jaren I wanted to get you
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.960]  on the show to talk about the birds and the news reporting on electromagnetic
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:45.480]  weather modification systems farms they're putting in all over the world
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.640]  most of them of course are covert but the Arabs are admitting they've got them
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.800]  and then right after that happened I guess great minds think alike coast to
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.320]  am called and got you and I on together that was certainly an informative and
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.960]  fast-paced hour yeah that was great you know and it's been a long time since
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:06.880]  we've been together on radio and it's always always great to be on with folks
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.560]  that stay informed on this stuff because as you know so many people are just
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.400]  unaware and it and it is a little bit technical but these are the things of
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.920]  the 21st century and things that all of us can can weigh in on well it certainly
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.240]  is what do you want to tackle first you want to get into the weather
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.840]  modification of the Tesla technologies or do you want to get into the leaked
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.080]  document EPA knowingly approved be killing pesticide mass burden fish die
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:41.200]  off scope global spark in times panic let's jump into the weather modification
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.720]  going on in the Middle East right now because that I think is perhaps one of
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.560]  the big drivers for a lot of these things that we're starting to see you know
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.640]  the idea that we can modify weather utilizing technologies is you know has
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.840]  been around a long time people remember the stories of cloud seeding and using
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:03.720]  various chemicals and compounds to try and suck a little moisture out of the
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:08.560]  atmosphere but really some big changes happen in the understanding of how
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:14.000]  energy interacts with weather systems became interesting for many researchers
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.160]  electro statics the stuff of the article in the Middle East being able to
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:23.480]  create and stimulate a rainfall that's been around quite a while in fact if you
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:29.680]  go back to number years ago back in the 90s there were some very large fires in
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:35.280]  Indonesia blowing smoke into Malaysia many will remember that situation is
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.720]  pretty horrendous but at that time missed by most but the mainstream did pick it
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.160]  up there was an article about a Russian company offering electro statics
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.720]  basically saying hey we can steer the here we can create up artificial
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:54.240]  hurricane and blow the smoke right out of the way during the Olympics I came up
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.840]  both in in Russia and China at various times that weather modification was one
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.600]  way to keep the Olympics free of bad weather all of this while all of this is
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:10.040]  going on and gaining you know great currency in terms of science the there's
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.040]  been no sort of regulation of it you know when you look at the planet you can't
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.400]  alter weather in one place and just expect that everything sort of stays in
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:22.200]  that neighborhood that isn't how it works whatever we do in one place has
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:30.120]  profound and usually unexpected results elsewhere and that's where some pretty
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:35.080]  significant risk come in the other place going back to some of the work that
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:40.000]  Bernard Eastland was doing when he invented harp that that whole system
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.720]  was predicated on huge huge amounts of energy being available for manipulating
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:51.760]  weather formations and what Eastland discovered in 2004 2005 couple years
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:56.080]  before he died was the idea that harp could manipulate what are called
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.520]  gravitational waves which he believed were the root of weather systems using
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.640]  energy one sixteen hundredth of the energy he originally thought was needed
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.440]  in other words just a small small fraction of energy was needed to
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:14.120]  manipulate gravitational waves that then would have this cascading reaction
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.840]  through geophysical systems including weather systems and and that that
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.680]  research he actually presented when I was working as executive director of the
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:29.840]  Institute we had dr. Eastland in Dallas for a conference on mind effects and one
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.720]  of the things that he talked about course was harp and some of its
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:38.720]  applications particularly in this area of weather modification from your deep
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.560]  research I know you've gone through that harp is multifaceted over the horizon
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:50.120]  radar type systems weather modification I mean really it's an array of things but
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:56.280]  when you talk about gravitational waves it's interesting Fox News and others are
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.560]  pointing out that meteorologists climatologists appears Corbin who we've
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:09.440]  had on before stunningly can predict the weather with many times more accuracy
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:14.560]  than these big so-called computer models because he focuses on gravitational
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.120]  waves and he goes back to the multi-hundred-year-old science for the
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:23.600]  old-timers didn't know why but it was connected to the moon changing and they
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.600]  didn't know what the action was then they just knew that when the moon was in
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.840]  certain cycles it was doing certain things now they know that it's the moon
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:38.040]  causing different gravitational events but also shielding the earth or or
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:43.000]  exposing the earth more to the solar winds of different ionizing particles so
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.280]  there's a lot of things within the earth without the earth that are driving
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:54.560]  whether the science shows more than what mainline global warming type kook
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.560]  scientists say and they know this too they just want to ignore it and claim
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.240]  that you know humans exhaling carbon dioxide is causing it so so a what what
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:07.480]  is harp really a b I've seen the reports that they're really harp centers all
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:12.200]  over the world they just call them other things and then a c could this be
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:16.720]  connected to the increase in earthquakes it could be you know go let's go for the
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.960]  first thing there are many facilities that have phased arrays radiofrequency
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.960]  transmitters designed like harp harp is the acronym for this specific project
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.840]  but these arrays exist in several locations around the world including the
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:34.440]  former Soviet Union Canada throughout Europe the Chinese even have a wanted
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.920]  Antarctica so you know that it's pretty widespread in terms of that the
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:44.480]  technology what harp is designed for is manipulating the ionosphere changing
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:49.600]  this layer above the earth's surface that is so it's responsible in large
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.560]  part for the quality and character of communications for the fact that we have
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:17:00.000]  biological life even on this planet and using energy essentially as the base of
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.480]  this system to alter the geophysics of the planet the things that actually make
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:10.680]  the planet outrun at work so think about it as sort of a man-made component
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:17.040]  shoved on the machine of earth to change its character in certain respects and
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.000]  the way it works using energy itself and so when you think about for the
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.760]  direction in which this science has taken us it's not just about harp it's
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.320]  this whole revolution of military affairs I know you've talked to your
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:36.720]  audience about before this this rma includes a whole class of weapons and
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.800]  technologies of which harp is really just a very small part it's just the
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:45.920]  one part that happens to have gotten a good bit of notoriety because we sort of
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:51.840]  attacked that as you know one very fine example of where where this technology
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:56.840]  is going and more importantly it is the largest radio transmitter of its kind
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.640]  ever designed and built in the world and it presents huge challenges
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:06.240]  particularly in the areas we're talking about today and of course when we talk
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.800]  about this only being one component we look at things like the Hadron super
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.560]  conducting super collider and just like 10 15 years ago they'd make fun of us
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.320]  have we even said harp existed now it's common knowledge right I read what the
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:26.520]  directors of Hadron have said they've admitted yeah there's a small
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.880]  probability that this could create a strange lit or that a black hole could
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.760]  get purchased and actually get enough mass into it but it's a low probability
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:42.000]  but then that makes me go back to the 1950s and 60s where the US was
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.520]  detonating high-powered hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere and they thought
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.720]  there was a good chance it might actually destroy the atmosphere but they
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.920]  still did it so when I see statements like that it I mean what do you I mean
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.160]  there's no way to quantify it but I mean just from a layman this looks like this
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:06.480]  could really damage the planet or even destroy our civilization right well you
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.960]  know this is again where science kind of moves on and sort of forgets the rest of
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.120]  us in the background as that we didn't if we didn't exist a lot of scientists
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.280]  are very incensed when laypeople are the average person that starts to weigh in
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:25.480]  on their issues they feel like it's sort of their exclusive domain and no one
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:30.160]  else is qualified the reality is when you talk about effects of technologies
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:35.520]  we're all qualified to weigh it we may not be the engineers or designers but
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.400]  that should not matter and in this century what we're doing with this
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:45.000]  technology is either gonna make us free or make us slaves and we all should
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.200]  have a debate and have input on that stay there let's get into Hadron let's
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.120]  get into other advanced technologies that you're concerned about also want to
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.880]  ask the question why are so many of these heart programs the Chinese and
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:02.120]  others why are they near the polls what's important about that is it really
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.920]  possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys 18 years
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:09.800]  ago we developed a program that has made thousands debt free in just 90 days
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:14.520]  it's called zero debt in 90 days and it works for all credit card debt medical
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:19.280]  bills even collection lawsuits when I first joined I was being sued so I use
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:24.040]  the program methods and after filing one piece of paper the collection lawsuit
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:28.240]  was dismissed with zero debt in 90 days your success is guaranteed in writing
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.840]  there is no other program of its kind don't be along with creditors gang up
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:35.520]  on you let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.840]  creditors in only 90 days guaranteed prevent wage garnishments bank levies
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.600]  and stop collection calls with our proven program call zero debt in 90 days
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:49.240]  now 800 477 9256 and ask for free information from an expert who also
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:56.760]  completed our program 800 477 9256 or zero debt guarantee dot com 800 477
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:03.360]  9256 or zero debt guarantee dot com gold it's like nothing else on earth from
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.000]  the Romans through the Renaissance from the industrial age to the space age
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.160]  gold has weathered the test of time for 6,000 years gold has remained the
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.840]  ultimate store of wealth according to the world gold council in the US Mint
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:20.600]  demand is at an all-time high the stage is being set for the reemergence of gold
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:24.840]  as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker

[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.320]  Parliament he of course has been the president of both the Alaskan Federation
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:42.080]  of Teachers and the Anchorage City Council of Education and I'm getting to
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:47.920]  his doctorate all day his brother is a US senator his father was a doctor I mean
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:53.600]  was Nick Baggett's senior this is a short segment long segment coming up but
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.800]  dot getting back into this what are your concerns overall with something like the
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:04.000]  Hadron superconducting supercollider and are there other technologies and other
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.680]  scientific operations that you're more concerned about well the the risks
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:12.640]  associated with big science you know is there they even identified I mean the
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:18.560]  idea of creating a catastrophic event with this type of technology again this
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:23.880]  is why we need a little closer scrutiny and I am I am actually more concerned
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.880]  about the things that we we don't see I mean what we see in the open literature
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:34.200]  certainly hair-raising in some in some cases and pretty disturbing in others
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.040]  but what what we do know is that the direction in which the technologies have
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:45.760]  moved is really more about how do you affect biological systems like human
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:52.120]  beings and other other systems in a way where you can literally manipulate the
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.320]  players I mean when you think about military interventions you know and
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.880]  we're looking at it right now you look at our budget on rebuild on countries
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:06.760]  after we go in and annihilate them it's pretty pretty costly expense and a lot
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:10.920]  of this is based on the idea that hey is there a better way is there a way to
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.160]  affect the human beings without tearing up their infrastructure so we have to
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.360]  rebuild it and there is and it's this direction in technologies that allows
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:24.760]  that possibility and the difference is when you start to target the human being
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:28.640]  in this way it is much much different than bombs and bullets and starts to
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.040]  raise the bigger kinds of questions of you know what's rational and we've said
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:39.400]  biological and chemical weapons are immoral and yet weapons that affect on
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:44.520]  in a much more profound way than chemicals aren't even restricted at all
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:49.120]  and this I think is is critically important is the reactions of chemicals
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:53.160]  or chemical constituents that we're so appalling in World War one have been
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:57.840]  replaced by electronic systems that essentially deliver the same kind of
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.320]  effects so we're not talking about a different outcome we're just talking
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.760]  about a different delivery and to simplify it you're talking about mind
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.720]  control and I've seen the patents that you've covered I looked at them at the
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:13.480]  patent office I I've seen articles in the Baltimore Sun where it goes oh
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:20.720]  DARPA is looking at putting up towers to calm you during emergencies and I mean
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.600]  just like 10 15 years ago they'd make fun of us talking about harp now it's
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:29.120]  mainstream now more and more they're like we are gonna put cameras everywhere
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:32.320]  to make sure that our AI and make sure you're behaving yourself in your house
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:37.320]  we are gonna mind control you this is a brave new world and and so you talk
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:42.280]  about for whatever bit of technology we see there's an iceberg beneath that
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:46.320]  right I mean how much of this stuff we even know about doc very very a little
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:50.280]  actually what you see in the open literature is just a fragment a grain
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:54.880]  of sand on the beach and knowledge if you will there's just so much more out
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.480]  there when you look at the area of any of the areas that we've covered you know
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.760]  from a mind effects to weather effects you know we've been covering them now
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:07.920]  over 15 years and consistently and this is the true test in my opinion you go
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:14.280]  back to our original writings in 1994 and nothing has changed you can look
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:19.000]  through those those articles those books the materials we produced and we have
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.720]  not changed our opinion one IO to the facts that we identified then and the
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.760]  sources that we referenced them primarily government military and
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.680]  mainstream documents that were unclassified nothing has happened to
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.520]  change our opinions only to prove that we were correct and you've experienced
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:38.560]  same thing in a lot of your work and and the mainstream does eventually catch
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.760]  up but but usually it's sort of when the train has left the station it is
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.440]  already arriving somewhere else that's where we are on this technology and
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:54.160]  again you know the idea of affecting weather systems of affecting other forms
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.960]  of living organisms including you know the latest thing with the birds you know
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:02.280]  now we hear another situation in Louisiana very similar to what was in
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:08.440]  Arkansas yep and so there was a very interesting study and this gets back to
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.880]  you know people want to blame the chemistry and I was in a conference in
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.760]  Brussels it was a closed conference for a group called globe which is 44
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:22.080]  government legislators and then they're 12th the General Assembly in 1997 I
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.880]  attended and the people that we were an lecturing with on the other side was a
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:31.360]  group that had just written a book on chemicals creating false hormones in the
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.000]  environment and I was talking with the guys from MIT and from Washington that
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.680]  was possible for that and the overlay is energy itself because it triggers very
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:46.000]  bizarre chemical that's right instead of putting chemicals in you they can use
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.600]  harmonics or waves to make you produce it yourself stay there doctor we'll be
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:56.640]  right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:00.000]  GCN radio network
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:06.760]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:12.160]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.600]  will be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:20.320]  an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:25.600]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:30.160]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:34.840]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:38.880]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.560]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:47.600]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:53.680]  a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.960]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:10.720]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:14.680]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:19.040]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:23.480]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:28.240]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:32.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:35.640]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:40.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.160]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:46.840]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:51.600]  can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:55.880]  backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:33:09.400]  backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 we now take you live to the central Texas
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:14.320]  command center and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:17.200]  Jones show
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:25.800]  we are back live dr. nick of baggage riding shotgun with this honor to have
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.760]  him we're gonna go back to him in a moment you know we're carrying two new
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:34.240]  films one of which I produced one illustrates the political rulers of
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:39.880]  this planet and their open call to set up a global planetary dictatorship for
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:45.240]  the orderly population reduction of at least 80% of the planet and then a
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:50.560]  scientific dictatorship over the 500 million that remain so we know they've
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.760]  built this system and are accelerating its completion and we know that they do
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:59.760]  not have our interest at heart that is covered in the film invisible empire a
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.600]  new order to find Jason Bermas's excellent work available at info wars
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:08.200]  dot com and in this film what in the world are they spring getting into now
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:12.200]  there's so many of the public admissions of the geoengineering just what the
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:18.920]  researchers 15 16 17 years ago said aluminum to oxide barium salt turns out
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.960]  that's exactly what they are spraying the patents for mixing it in the jet fuel
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:26.760]  you name it it is what the world are they spring all available at the online
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:33.240]  video bookstore of info wars dot com and they are discounted I might add for you
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:42.640]  you can also call toll free 888 253 3139 888 253 3139 or write to us peel box
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:50.520]  19549 Austin Texas 787 6 0 going back to dr. nick baggage a start over because
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.440]  that was a short segment you got interrupted by the break you were
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:57.920]  getting into going to this important global meeting you've also advised the
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:06.400]  EU parliament you also again are really covering serious issues here and so go
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.240]  back to the point you were having an argument will it be chemical suppression
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:13.920]  we know that's the old 60-year-old system of fluoride the water or will it be
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:18.120]  electromagnetic go ahead right and and and so we have this discussion and the
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:22.840]  biggest concern of the folks with the chemical model was yeah and their
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:26.600]  answer was grand kind of like this yeah we know about all that but it's hard
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:31.040]  enough to tell the public about the chemicals much less their interactions
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.280]  now with all these various forms of energy surrounding us but but let me
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:38.880]  explain just a little bit you know when you look at Tesla's work and I've read
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:44.080]  all of his patents I've looked at all of his work in in English and in German and
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:49.840]  and and in looking at at Tesla his big thing really boils down to one thing and
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:55.080]  it's a resonance harmonies to be the ability to transmit a signal and receive
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:36:00.480]  a signal has everything to do with resonance and creating resonance
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:05.160]  resonance signals and reaction so when you look at that and sort of the the
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:09.240]  mechanical side of the world although he did touch into into health issues through
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:14.280]  his dithermia units and others then I look at my good friend reho macaela's
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:19.520]  work as an electrophysiologist looking at the same mechanism but applying it to
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.880]  living living things particularly humans when you look at how that works as you
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.640]  can have for instance all of us have a little bit of iodine in our body and and
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:33.880]  we need that and it regulates a lot of our biological functions if we don't
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.480]  have enough we got problems we have way too much we have a toxic situation well
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.600]  there was a guy named Becker who wrote some excellent work that use this as an
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:49.960]  example and you can send in for instance the signal that harmonizes with iodine
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:53.960]  and actually when you then look at the body the person being impacted by this
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:58.640]  external signal they show all the symptoms of iodine poisoning except when
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:02.840]  you do the blood work to check the thyroid there's no indication of why
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:08.400]  that could be just the symptoms appear a mystery illness if you will and it it's
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:12.480]  the same effect as the chemicals without them now you think about that for a
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:16.880]  moment and you start to apply that sort of the randomness of signals that come
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:23.760]  across and through us every day of various various not just premeditated
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:29.080]  governments or corporations with these technologies but what about the cell
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.800]  phones and and the wireless in this and and being bathed in this frequency
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.280]  pollution this is I'm actually in Europe and I know people are going to
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:43.280]  say it's another greeny conspiracy but actually it's not there was a Swiss
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.040]  reinsurance went and looked at the insurance industry and they are like
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.880]  one of the guys that tell the rest of the industry hey guys don't ensure these
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:54.960]  risks because you'll lose your rear end and what they said about electromagnetic
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:59.160]  pollution or what they called electro smog is anyone who ensures these kinds
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:04.400]  of risks in terms of physical effects it will likely lead to the bankruptcy of
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:07.800]  the insurance industry if we start to ensure these risks and even Lloyds the
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:13.440]  London at last my last check would not would not sign on to biological risk to
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:18.000]  risk of say cell phones affecting or creating tumors or this kind of thing
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.440]  because the scientific literature is telling the insurance industry which
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.480]  tends to respond a little bit faster than most because they have real money at
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:31.840]  stake won't ensure these risks now if you take that and you overlay it across
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.560]  everything we've done and this is one of the observations in Europe in Europe
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:39.920]  they noticed that a certain species of pine tree was just dying out they
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.920]  couldn't figure it out and then people started to look at the science and if
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.840]  these forests were sitting between microwave transmitters that were
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:52.960]  transmitting millimeter waves very short wavelengths that happened to correlate
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:59.040]  harmonize with the needles of that particular pine tree and they acted
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:03.440]  like little antennas receiving that signal but then altering the nature of
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:08.320]  those plants and causing them to die off that is how resonance works you know
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:11.840]  when you think about the bees and what's going on with these right now you
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:14.680]  know by the way I mean just interrupt you because I want to but that was all
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:19.240]  over mainstream news the last month it is confirmed that this is going on but
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:24.520]  I've just talked to highway repair crews and and because I've seen this
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.720]  visually myself and I've I've said are you cutting the plants more often right
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:35.720]  around these microwave towers and they'll say no and I'll say well I mean
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.560]  have you noticed that the grass doesn't grow as fast or doesn't grow as well or
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:44.560]  is dead when it gets dry and they said absolutely I mean you can drive around
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:51.800]  and just visually see on how unhealthy plants are around these towers and
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:56.640]  there's all the studies about increases in tumors I mean as you know for decade
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.240]  schools right would get money to put a cell phone tower right on top the school
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:05.080]  and then the kids on the third floor you know massive cancer same things in
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:09.920]  buildings I mean we know I mean there's how many thousands of studies have
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.160]  shown the same thing well plenty and I'll tell you even in other health
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.840]  authorities around the world pay attention to the German health
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:22.520]  authorities do not allow towers to be erected around places where children
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:27.440]  congregate daycare centers in schools they in Europe in Great Britain they
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:30.840]  warn parents every school year before school begins don't let your kids use
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:34.640]  cell phones under a certain age because they're still developing and the effects
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.080]  of these are pretty profound and the difference is they use what's called the
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:41.840]  precautionary principle in Europe on environmental and health issues where
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:45.360]  they start to tell the public about the time the insurance companies start to
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:48.760]  get concerned the public gets to get the information so we get to make the same
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:53.080]  kind of decision some insurance company gets to make which is do we want to take
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:57.720]  the risk or not even though all the science might not be in and you know in
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.280]  over 40 years that they've applied this principle throughout Europe they have
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.960]  never once been wrong well I mean to magnify that that's just like the FDA
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.400]  doesn't want us to know if we have a genetically engineered cross-bc salmon I
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.360]  mean in America we have to fight to even know if we're eating a clone well and
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.920]  you know here in Alaska we don't allow farm a farm salmon because we actually
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:25.080]  have a good product it's created naturally we're the 12th largest fishery in
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:28.840]  the world that's ranking us against every country in the world Alaska alone
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:34.680]  we produce 90% of all of the fresh caught salmon that people consume in the
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:38.160]  United States and most people don't know it and there is a difference when you
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:42.600]  start to genetically modify and this gets back in to the topic of the day you
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:47.800]  can deliberately manipulate salmon species so they grow 30 times faster by
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:53.040]  you know messing around with the DNA but you could also also alter salmon
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.480]  species in a couple of other ways you can alter their migration patterns
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:01.400]  because they orient by magnetic field lines and our technologies are now
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:06.920]  interfering causing disruptions in those migrations and secondly you can alter
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:13.520]  using again electromagnetic field you can manipulate what happens within a
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:19.960]  DNA structures so you can alter species either accidentally as a side effect or
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.680]  a deliberate effect and this is again where the problem comes in you know
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:27.720]  those same microwaves that transfer all of our communications a slight change
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:33.120]  just a slight change in the wavelength might eliminate the biological
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.600]  interactions in other words they're so precise they're like dialing through the
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:41.520]  radio station they only count when you get harmony resonance between the
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.960]  transmitter and receiver you get a nice clear signal like people dialing to the
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:50.000]  dial and hearing us today the same is true with the earth and all of the living
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.520]  things on the earth including us but in between the station it's just static no
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:01.040]  harm no foul that's what we need to learn to express and so much of the work
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:06.480]  in this area has been classified for weapons application yet the understanding
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:11.360]  of sort of what areas and what energy ranges do you avoid we used to think it
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:15.760]  was just high energy heat producing kind of energy but it's not the subtle
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:20.120]  energies also have huge effects and we can segregate that through knowledge and
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:25.280]  then run our technologies in a much safer conducive way in fact there are
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:31.000]  certain energy fields that actually increase our our potential health wise
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.080]  rather than depress it and so we need to be more mindful of what we're doing and
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:41.240]  be more deliberate in it so that we don't interfere with people and living
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:45.120]  creatures and that we're good stewards on this planet in a balanced and
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:51.880]  appropriate way in your gut dr. Nick baggage do you believe humanity is
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:55.040]  going to make it to a type one civilization for those that don't know
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.680]  that means a civilization viable not just bound to this planet I mean will
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:04.360]  humanity survive because the attitudes and the behaviors of the globalist is
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:11.760]  they seem to social Darwin in a social Darwinistic way just embrace anything
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:16.000]  no matter how horrible and they make a lot of self-destructive nihilistic
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.480]  statements and they claim there's this big method to their madness and they're
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:25.680]  good at screwing stuff up and stealing and robbing but I don't have a lot of
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:31.720]  confidence unless free humanity forces a renaissance of real debate and then it
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:36.280]  takes control of our global civilization and forces a real debate about this I
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:40.000]  don't have a lot of hope for us and I unfortunately you know don't even know
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.400]  if I'll be able to live to see grandchildren if we don't turn this
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:48.520]  around what's your gut tell you well I am obviously concerned or I wouldn't be
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:53.480]  engaged in the work and and I joke with people like I call myself a pathological
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:58.480]  optimist because I still think there's a way for humanity through this I I just
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:02.360]  really believe that and I believe it on a fundamental basis I think that human
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:07.560]  beings and this is my personal belief you can debate it or not but I believe
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:12.040]  that human beings are created in the image of a creator and that means a lot
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:18.520]  more than some physical form walking around eating Cheerios we are very potent
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:23.200]  as human beings each and every one of us there is no insignificant human on this
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:28.280]  planet I don't care what you think where you think you sit at the moment you have
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.960]  the ability we each have the ability to step forward into what we are and what
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:37.360]  we've been created to be which is a much different way of living than the way
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:42.720]  we're living now as really slaves in so many respects under so many different
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.160]  systems that control every aspect of our beautifully said the globalists have
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:57.400]  created really like a false almost zoo like human rarium type type system where
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.320]  we're in a fake habitat a false habitat and they're slowly changing the
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.280]  habitat and more and more towards a dehumanizing control grid and I agree
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.480]  the dynamic limitless creativity of the human spirit and I want us to have that
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:16.960]  destiny I'm saying if we don't those of us that can see it intellectually and
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.880]  feel it in our gut and know it if we don't act on our survival instincts and
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:25.840]  then intellectually and scientifically face this and blow the horn warning
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:30.000]  people I think the globalists are gonna destroy all of us I think you're right
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.520]  on that and I think it is up to us and you know when you talk about mind
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:38.480]  control issues and I've researched them now for many many years and you know the
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:42.160]  biggest thing that the military discovered in all of this wasn't you
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:46.280]  know the kinds of things people usually default to out of fear it's about the
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:50.240]  Manchurian kind of candidate or about manipulating me or each of us to do for
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:54.560]  things you know that kind of feeling of imposition and the fear that goes with
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:59.200]  it and here is the reality of fear and worry and anxiety as if you look at an
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:03.640]  EEG brain activity of people experiencing those emotions the kind of brain
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.640]  activity you see is not associated with intellectual processing of any great
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:12.680]  degree it's not associated with the kind of thinking and higher-order capability
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:17.560]  that humans often demonstrate those brain waves are only demonstrated when
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:22.960]  you're experiencing the emotions of compassion empathy love yes and and
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:26.480]  those emotions are associated with higher-order thinking and that higher-
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:30.640]  ordered thinking happens to be associated and this is what military
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:34.640]  research might control showed with what are called anomalous human
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.800]  capabilities or what used to be called a few thousand years ago gifts of the
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:44.280]  spirit in some quarters other things another quarter how we use our gifts
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:49.160]  and what those are intended to do will change the face of this planet and I
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:52.320]  believe that absolutely believe it totally agree dr. Beggart I want you
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:56.360]  to elaborate on this that's why the social engineers who are greedy and
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:01.760]  wicked who know these secrets and consciously decide to dumb us down so
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.880]  that we're not in the equation of having any input on the type of civilization
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.080]  we build that's why everything they do is to create a false almost matrix of
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:18.880]  disinformation and media control to suppress us within small boxes and
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:23.000]  for me at a gut level that is the ultimate crime against the species
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.840]  but ultimate crime against who we are and I just burned with a desire to
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:34.080]  defeat these people well and it's and I think that that is possible doesn't
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.640]  take millions and millions of people to make change in the world it takes one
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:43.320]  or two to see it slightly differently and found and I won't be found the alarm
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:48.480]  like you're in a panic but to awaken the rest of our brothers and sisters on
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:53.200]  this planet to our possibilities and I think that's where so much of what we've
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:57.160]  seen is about tearing tearing things down rather than building them up and we
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:02.320]  have an opportunity to build one another up this planet can I say this loudly it
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:08.280]  can support the billions of people that live here no one arrived by accident and
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.960]  anyone who believes that I think has missed the miss the deeper meaning of
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:17.560]  this experience and we have an opportunity this generation is the
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:23.080]  generation that will decide whether or not we have a world that frees us to our
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:29.200]  higher possibilities and potentials or continues to suppress us in really what
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:35.040]  is a scripted program I mean you're not watching the programs we are the
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.000]  programs and we can either change it by by recognizing what we are and move
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.160]  forward and I think that's that's really the challenge and it's overcoming each
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:47.920]  of us overcoming our own anxieties and fears and worries and starting to step
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:53.000]  in with confidence knowing a that we're not alone there are in fact millions of
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.920]  people doing the same thing and we don't have to wait for some formal
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:00.240]  organization to form we're already standing in it was created long ago at
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:05.480]  the human race and we need to rise to the potential that was given us as our
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.920]  birthright and claim it back and change the world around us I mean it's so easy
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.880]  I know to get lost in the fear and worry of the time we're facing

[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:23.440]  everyone feels that and everyone knows it and again I want to emphasize there
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:27.440]  are no insignificant events people need to step into what they believe to be
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.320]  right and true begin acting responsibly not with fear and worry but with
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:35.080]  confidence knowing that each step we take is to step in a different and a right

[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:25.280]  Baggage 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 Dr. Baggage we were talking during the break
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:28.360]  about the global social engineers we know there's several different power
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:32.880]  blocks and I know they know these secrets that we're discussing here but
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:36.920]  they've made the conscious decision to do dehumanizing things so they
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:42.240]  greedily can control the future and I was asking you how can they know these
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:47.520]  great truths and consciously turn against those how when they tune in to
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:51.680]  what those of us that have discovered the larger scope of reality how could they
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:57.360]  gaze upon this and the human potential and decide to engage in the type of
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:03.000]  activities they are well firstly I'll tell you two things that are very
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.640]  telling in this is firstly what all that research showed was that people have
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:11.040]  these capabilities late within us in fact there's two studies being done by
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.000]  DARPA now in California for looking at methods for figuring out how telepathy
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.960]  works mental telepathy knowing what people think now imagine yourself being
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:25.640]  in the new world order crowd and the population knowing what you think you
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:28.920]  know there's a lot of people with a lot of dark secrets that would prefer not to
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:33.760]  have them open in the light of day and that's that's again part of this fear
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:38.480]  is if people really had these potentials active in their lives on a regular basis
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:44.440]  there would be no place to hide we'd be laid bare I mean think about it all of
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:51.200]  our sins all of our good things that have happened in our life laid bare but
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:55.160]  that's already there just people don't know how to recognize it I don't want to
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:59.360]  get off into this but I've had many dream dreams that come true exactly I
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:04.120]  constantly I mean it's just constant and then most people just don't know how
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:08.080]  to recognize that it's already there that we're already electromagnetically
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.720]  tied into everything yeah and the fact is everyone's wrong we get little
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:14.720]  glimpses and all of us have experienced that we go wow that was really
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:18.800]  interesting but here's what also is known is that there's specific biological
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:23.880]  activity that is associated with those kinds of events and this is where the
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:29.680]  science went in the 60s and 70s is figuring out hey can we make someone
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:33.720]  else experiencing same kinds of things and as they discovered that everybody
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:39.120]  every human has a natural capacity for these things scared the heck out of them
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.120]  and then the question well how do you control this kind of activity from
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:47.480]  breaking out you know within populations where they can actually be free you do
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.480]  it with fear and worry because you really I'm telling you that if you look
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:56.560]  at this under with scientific instruments to measure brain activity you
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:01.400]  cannot I repeat cannot reach higher states of consciousness as long as you
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:07.600]  were worried and fearful and think back on on on on your upbringing in terms of
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:12.000]  how people related to fear and how fear was used and you really recognize how
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:19.880]  powerful it is but how evil it is at the base to use that to motivate people
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:25.280]  rather than the logic and the good sense of good argument and that's what's
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:28.760]  driving so much and here's the other part of the problem is the planners
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:32.880]  military planners you know in the military and even the west it's in a
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.120]  closet because they're not run by the military they're run by the civilian
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:40.560]  sector the reason for that is military has to have this sort of paranoid
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:44.280]  mindset where they think of every horrible thing that could ever happen
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:48.320]  and then build a plan to safeguard the country that's their job and I don't
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:52.320]  begrudge the poor fact I'm glad they're there doing that job but because that
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:57.600]  thinking has to do with this trust has to do with dealing with the evilest of
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.040]  evil people that look at this is okay what do we do to get on top of it keep
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:05.400]  people from falling into these positions of them but then you have
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:09.320]  bureaucrats deciding that maybe they know best what people ought to be thinking
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:12.520]  well they call it full spectrum dominance they say the truth must be
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:17.680]  guarded by a bodyguard of lies they fill every vacuum of possible evil in the
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:21.720]  name of full spectrum dominance but they have now become evil they have not
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:27.080]  defeated all the avenues of other evil by filling every criminal spectrum right
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:31.360]  it's like it's like the war on terror is supposed to reestablish freedom we
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:37.440]  got the most oppressed surveys society ever exactly stay there analyzing the
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:42.040]  enemy attack profile though it's completely premeditated are you tired
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:47.680]  of searching for great talk radio something more important search no more we

[01:59:55.520 --> 02:00:01.640]  corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:13.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:20.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:26.920]  Alex Jones I tell you I think during the breaks a lot of times even better
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.480]  radio zone air with these guests I mean I'm just as intrigued as excited as
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:35.320]  you are even more so constant discussions with my guests during the
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:39.240]  breaks but it is the breaks that allow us you know in this system to get the
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:43.520]  energy cubes we need to be on air and you know finance this whole thing so it
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:47.560]  is symbiotic we appreciate all of our sponsors but I was bringing up the fact
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:52.720]  really asking dr. baggage to judge who I am because it's always good to have
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:58.440]  outside perspectives and I said well you know I really am fearless but it's
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:01.640]  because I know I've got to do this because it's the right direction and
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:05.240]  that we are basically going down the wrong road of I don't so it's not a
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:09.240]  thing of courage fighting corruption it's something I've got to do like a
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.200]  tropism it was something that's just ingrained in me but sometimes it comes
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:17.960]  off like fear for me if my neighbor's house is on fire and I call them and say
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:23.840]  wake up your house is on fire that's not fear that's taking action right and
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:28.440]  dr. baggage agreed with me I mean what's your view on on yourself and what
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:31.760]  you do what I'm doing yeah I think that's true and you know each of us have
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:36.280]  a gift and when we recognize the gift to begin to work within it it doesn't
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:41.560]  create fear create the opposite confidence a sense of a purpose because
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:45.920]  you are doing what you're talented and good at and that's again for the rest
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:49.840]  of the public out there you know each of us have those gifts and we all have a
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:54.320]  sphere of influence whether it's our families and friends or a radio audience
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:59.120]  but when you're working within your gifts and within that realm you don't
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:05.400]  experience fear you know as an individual I don't I know you don't Alex and it's
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:08.880]  because we're doing what we know we can do what we're capable of doing we know
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:12.960]  we're not alone we're being assisted in lots of different ways but we move
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:17.400]  forward in that knowledge safely and confidently and without fear if you're
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:23.120]  experiencing fear and worry as you engage to engage a conflict perhaps you
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:27.160]  need to pull back a little bit and analyze whether it's you that should
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:30.840]  engage this conflict or whether you should hand the baton to another or
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:34.600]  whether it's the right time you know ask yourself you know those those things
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:39.480]  are normal emotions to tell us hey be careful be cautious if you plow through
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:43.960]  them you have a lot of risk and I don't think we're ever put into a battle that
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:47.400]  we're not equipped to fight but we have to know that going into the battle so each
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:51.760]  one that we each individually pick becomes incredibly important yeah if you
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:56.860]  are hearing a danger will Robinson back off ease back I mean my problem Dr.
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:03:02.520]  Beckett's I never hear the danger will Robinson it's just full speed ahead but
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:05.720]  you know occasionally I got to say this occasionally though Alex and I know you
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:08.840]  do this as well as I do you'll be in the course of your work you'll run into
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:13.800]  someone that you just have that thinking bad feeling about yes and you just go
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:17.040]  well I don't know why I don't know how but I'm just going to ignore this
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:20.840]  situation or avoid this individual then you know six months rolls by and you
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:25.920]  figure out why well I think that's important and so it's not really fear as
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:31.400]  much as it is awareness again of what's around you and and what what can come
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:35.560]  against you and whose interest you're opposing because people like to keep
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:40.600]  their self-interest preserved and when you're stepping on toes as we are you
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:45.120]  know you excite some people but you know I look at it this way it that's great
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:48.840]  that means it's working you know when they start hammering on you it's working
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:52.760]  and you can look at at the work we've done over the years and it does make its
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:56.280]  way in you know in a number of the technical reports dealing with personal
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:01.040]  privacy issues first pulse and the work that we've done is cited there because
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:05.320]  it's it's quality material the stuff that we do to alert the public and
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:09.880]  stimulate activity is just that stimulating activity but the listeners
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:14.640]  people who hear these words and act on them do things that we could never do
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:19.240]  and and people go well I'm just this little guy doing this little thing what
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:24.120]  you don't know a guy walking down the street just as simple as a smile to the
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:27.960]  guy walking the other way and the guy walking the other way maybe gets that
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:32.600]  bit of encouragement and goes off and creates some great invention now who is
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:37.000]  the stimulator of that invention the guy who invented it or the guy who
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.160]  acted as the catalyst by a little use I think the guy who acted as the catalyst
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:46.040]  each of us is a catalyst and well it's the listeners of this broadcast that
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:50.680]  make it so incredibly powerful and dangerous to the globalist paradigm
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:52.800]  we're gonna come back and take phone calls this has been one of the most

[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:08.480]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:11.840]  Dr. Nick Baggins is our guest for the rest of this segment and I got a bunch of
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:15.440]  news and your calls from the beginning into John Markville Donna will get to
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:19.880]  at least you for Dr. Nick Baggins here in a moment but he said something that
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:28.640]  really struck home for me that I've been really focusing on lately and that's
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:34.600]  that we're not alone there are billions of people on this planet who are now
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:39.600]  awake and Zbigniew Brzezinski earlier last year he bemoaned that that it
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:43.720]  doesn't mean people have all the answers but they're now awakening and and
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:48.160]  shattering the tiny a little little cave that they've been put into and that
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:52.240]  and that we stand not just with those that are alive but literally with all
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:56.600]  other truth seekers and lovers of liberty throughout history and that's the
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:01.040]  most valuable thing in the world it's the only thing that's going to fulfill is
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:06.400]  fulfilling your destiny and being a good person I'm I'm totally with you you know
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.880]  and I think all of us again I want to emphasize you know some of the most
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:14.520]  profound things in my life have been triggered by people who think themselves
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:21.000]  insignificant and man I just can't say it enough is we beat ourselves up pretty
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.240]  thoroughly pretty regularly because we're sort of their worst critics of
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:28.840]  ourselves but cut yourself just a little bit of slack and if you know your
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:33.680]  problems try and overcome but more importantly take control of the things
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:36.760]  you can't take control of and that's where you start to build your confidence back
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.840]  you know on these issues if somebody asked you or me years ago when we began
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:45.120]  our work and it had laid out for us the past we would have traveled we had a
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:51.080]  looked at them like they were absolutely out of their mind and yet by stepping into
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:55.360]  what we could do we discovered all these other things that we could do and I
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:00.120]  think that's the true nature of this experience and you know the the backdrop
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.920]  of technologies and the evil in the world that so much of what we've had to
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:09.280]  talk about you know that's disturbing to folks but again it's the spirit in
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:12.840]  which the information is delivered like we were talking off there you know we're
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:17.440]  there to try and awaken the public to the issues that are important in this day
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:22.160]  and and in doing so we take a lot of responsibility I mean what people do as
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:27.240]  result of my words I don't just let go of it I know Alex you don't either that
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:31.360]  those words that influence other people's actions make me partially
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:35.600]  responsible for what others do and that was my next point I talked about that
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:39.720]  before you were on the day the only thing that freaks me out and it's not
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:44.120]  even freaks me out it's the only area where I get butterflies is that I
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:50.000]  genuinely am affecting people and I can see the growth curve it's exponential
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.880]  and and then I look at myself and I do beat myself up and I say you've got to
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:58.360]  do a better job look at the effect you're having but then I realized look
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:03.160]  all I'm doing is the best job I can and I've got a good heart I'm going in
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:07.360]  the right direction and so I just turn it over to God yeah I'm with you there
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:11.320]  absolutely with you there and and you know and I tell you you know even
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.240]  those of us that do this work every day you know we experience all the same
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:19.720]  kinds of things that everyone else does you know no one's free of anything in
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:23.720]  terms of attention in their lives in fact busy people tend to have very
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:31.040]  complex lives and that's kind of the way we thrive I think but again opportunity
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:36.360]  for change is there these technologies offer offer us great opportunities to
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:39.840]  enhance our possibilities and that's a lot of the work that I'm taking in the
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:44.680]  in this last year and moving forward I stopped lecturing for a couple of years
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:48.960]  and I may get back into a little more of that as time moves on but mainly to get
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:54.200]  a focus back on sort of a chance to look at what I've been doing look at the
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:57.600]  effect of it and then saying you know what are the most important things I
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:02.000]  need to address I was about to say I haven't for some reason you know years
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.800]  blip by and I hadn't called you in over a year to have you on and then I call you
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:11.440]  and I want to say you sound changed but I think like everybody you sound
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:17.000]  accelerated in the trajectory you were already on but you sound even more
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:22.120]  powerful I feel I feel like with the directions clear for me and the
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:27.280]  opportunity now to really offer encouragement and to try and take the
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:30.800]  messages that we've been giving on technology and show the other side of
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:35.960]  that sort and really start to focus more on okay these are the things that can
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:42.800]  be done to us what can we do ourselves what can we do to open up the
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:46.840]  understanding of what's happening and more importantly perhaps trigger some of
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:52.300]  our own latent capabilities so going off of defense on the offense absolutely
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:56.800]  let's let's look for the tools for transformation the things that allow us
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:00.760]  to move forward and I'm not you know there's there's two sides to this there's
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:05.360]  a mechanical side of things we can make and build that will help us be healthier
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:08.960]  think clearer you know do those kinds of things and then there's a spiritual
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:12.600]  component that is an individual component that we have to search out in
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:17.200]  our own ways and I'm you know I'm not that is not my direction in life to
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:22.320]  define that for folks but having said that anyone that I've ever met that's
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:27.960]  done anything decent in the world has a deep underlying religious philosophical
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:32.280]  underpinning and that matters well that was my next point we got to get to
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:35.840]  calls here or hold you longer if you can do it yeah but I promise to get to
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:41.880]  these I'm not bashing atheist I don't dislike atheist and I run into some
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:47.320]  who are overall good people but on average not as good and they can always
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:52.760]  use aberrant state-driven examples of religion being used as a cover or an
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:14:00.160]  envelope for bad but the people I see facing down real corruption now I mean
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:03.600]  they have an underlying you know tie into the universe they understand that
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:09.000]  justice you know the universe bends towards justice and I see the globalist
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:17.040]  always pushing an atheistic view a cynical view and but then when I actually
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:22.160]  study the New World Order they are secretly extremely religious but what
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:26.280]  would be called the dark side right I agree with that and again the
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:29.560]  recognition of what we are is is fundamental to the change you know we're
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:33.560]  talking about changing the way the world works we have to change the way we
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:38.680]  operate as individuals by recognizing first and individually what we are and
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:42.720]  then begin to act and then as we do we learn more about what we're capable of
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:47.720]  just like a little child it doesn't end it continues that's the whole living
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:53.920]  experience and we're being told stop thinking stop contemplating stop just
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.560]  fall into the herd and that is not what humans are intended to be and this
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:04.160]  globalist elitist type of attitudes paternalistic type of attitude needs
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:08.560]  to end and I think again it's been with us a long time you know religions
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:12.160]  tend to be corrupted usually a generation or two after as people discover
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:17.560]  the mysteries within the religion within the philosophy that actually you know
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.040]  science doesn't operate in a vacuum either you know God created order and
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:27.480]  out of that comes one tenth some science and you know helps us understand the
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:31.600]  creation but it isn't the creation in and of itself and that I think is again
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:35.520]  getting back to this basic thing about changing the world requires changing
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:39.120]  ourselves and getting rid of fear and worry is the first step in making that
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:44.480]  change and then opening up our eyes to the things that we can do and acting on
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:48.360]  it and seeking I believe it's important to seek the face of God or whatever that
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:53.120]  means to you I think that is incredibly important and in the seeking of the
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:57.120]  finding and I'm not going to help because that opens you up I mean now the
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:02.720]  box is gone when you start to seek it then you realize that you can see much
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:06.640]  further than you thought that's exactly it and then you also get this
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:11.000]  recognition you're not alone and then you start to recognize a little bit about
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.880]  what is possible as you start to run into what you call coincidences and you
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:18.440]  realize they're not coincidence at all you start to do things that all the
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:22.240]  sudden the resources appear when you didn't think there were any those are
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:27.400]  you know that's that's miraculous living and it starts with a changed attitude
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:33.000]  and a change to outlook and it is a struggle every single day to change who
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.840]  we are but it is critically important to recognize that's what life is on this
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:42.520]  planet from the time we're born to the time we die it's an evolution it's a
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:45.800]  recognition of our exactly the globalists try to create an artificial
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:50.400]  system we're on the surface there's no struggle right in that is actually the
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:56.480]  death you know of your individualistic drive it is through the struggle that we
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:00.240]  are empowered absolutely and in fact that's our best learning environment
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:03.200]  and you know in the one sense you know we're going through a rough time in the
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:06.440]  economy we're going through a lot of rough times around the country and we
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:09.560]  see the awakening and the awakening happens because that's when we
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:13.400]  recognize our own strengths because it's either die or live we have to make
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:17.960]  choices and then we start to recognize the neighbors that we have around us who
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:24.360]  we never even saw before who have their hand out and always did that's where the
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:29.160]  change well beautifully said let's take some calls and do one more short
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:32.840]  seven because the doc's got to go at 30 after and I really want to get to these
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:36.800]  calls but what a profound interview and I talked to the doc it was his idea but
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:40.520]  it's funny at the same time I've been thinking about folks to fill in more
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:44.440]  often when I'm working on films are going out of town and he just volunteered
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:47.160]  I could fill in some time so we're getting a great list of folks the
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:52.320]  health ranger dr. Nick baggage Paul Joseph Watson Lou Rockwell let's go
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:57.120]  ahead and talk to John in Colorado John you're our first caller for dr. Nick
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:03.680]  baggage yes hi how you doing good you got a question for him yeah I do I'm an
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:08.200]  electronics technician and I just love what you guys are talking about they
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:12.800]  have always been interested in physics and quantum physics and stuff like that
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:20.040]  but anyway the question I had was it does harp use a particular frequency yeah
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:25.440]  it does and it's a it's in the high-frequency range but it covers it
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:29.440]  because you have a technical background you can manipulate the primary signal
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:33.760]  and create a secondary effect which actually gives you the range of 16
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:37.480]  decades of frequency which covers everything from ultra low to visible
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:42.280]  light is that the modulation yes this is by modulating it or pulsing the signal
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:46.400]  to create varying effects in the coupling with the ionic spirit to utilize it for
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:50.360]  creating a fact but it's essentially a high-frequency transmitter if you you
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:54.360]  can go to the official harp website and get the specific frequency I don't have
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:59.080]  it right in front of me but again it's the narrow band of high-frequency that's
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:02.440]  used then to create this larger going back to that question I never had time
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:05.480]  to jam in and then we'll get another quick one to go to break them back with
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:10.760]  other callers but why are so many of these towers near the poles I mean is
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:14.240]  it easier to manipulate there well you want to be close to where the magnetic
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:18.280]  field lines intersect the earth which is at the pole and you also need a high
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:24.080]  available source of energy and of course in Alaska we have the oil and gas fields
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:27.800]  with an or slope 25 percent of all the undiscovered oil in the world is in the
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:32.520]  Arctic and so that's important but the magnetic field line locations is the
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:35.720]  critical element the closer they are to the ground the easier it is to inject
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:40.760]  energy into them much more efficient is there any evidence they're actually
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:46.360]  sucking some type of energy source out of the polar vortex well that you know
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:49.640]  that's a question that has not been adequately answered there's really a
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:53.240]  question of whether they can tap energy out of the ionosphere which is that
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:56.240]  because you I mean you have those magnetic fields correct coming in at that
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:59.480]  point into the atmosphere and into the pole will they ride back with more
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:03.840]  calls great question John this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:08.280]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:12.320]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:15.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:20.240]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:24.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:28.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:32.640]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:36.240]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:40.560]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:43.680]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:47.400]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:52.160]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:19.240]  Americans at home turn in this influence on our president in Congress and they
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:24.360]  really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:28.720]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our

[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:23.320]  left with dr. baggage I've hogged him for myself but we're going to your calls
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:29.920]  with quick questions who's up next here John Mark in Minnesota quick question or
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:36.040]  comment for dr. baggage yes doctor I was wondering your take on I don't know I
[02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:38.640]  didn't catch a whole show here so I don't know if you've covered this but I
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:44.640]  was wondering about the the Gulf oil spill and if some of the toxins could be
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:49.240]  coming out of the Gulf and coming on shore and developing some kind of a
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:55.240]  plow of gas or toxins and and killing the birds and animals down there that's a
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:59.000]  good question doc a great question I don't have any specific information on
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.240]  that and I've not I've not seen anything on that but you know we did see a huge
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:08.320]  release of toxic material there similar to what we had at the Valdez Exxon spill
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:13.760]  but we didn't see those kinds of effects associated with our spill here so it's
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:17.640]  hard to say I think the judge is out on that but it's certainly a good
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:21.440]  issue to raise because it did bring in a lot of toxins that weren't in the
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:25.360]  environment before well we we know when they say all the seafood safe the test
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:29.040]  have showed no it's not they've been a lot about that mark great question Bill
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:34.920]  in Florida you're on the air but under Nick baggage hi Alex um I've got a
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:40.200]  question how do I protect myself against a cell phone tower that is 200 yards
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:47.280]  away there's not a lot you can actually do I mean sort of creating a fair day
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:51.240]  cage and shunting the energy away from you and that's not a practical solution
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:56.880]  I can tell you up to 1500 meters cell towers have a biological effect that was
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:01.320]  documented years ago I left it with one of the scientists in Switzerland some
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:07.040]  years ago on this same subject and that's the range is 1500 meters which is
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:12.080]  you know quite a bit further out than you are the greater effect is with young
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:15.960]  children or developing children they tend to be more affected by this if you
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:19.920]  remember the old EPA studies power lines when they involved children they
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:23.240]  showed all kinds of negative effects so they read it the studies with just
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:29.240]  adults and showed no effects that's important the only real solution is
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:33.360]  reconsideration of your location if you feel it's affecting your health and
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:37.720]  in a deleterious way and we see this across the spectrum with fluoride many
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:41.600]  times worse for children it's radiation many times worse I guess it's
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:46.520]  something to do with the fast you're growing fast dividing cells right we
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:51.200]  know that radiation adults targets the gums the intestines fast-growing cells
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:54.640]  with a child the whole thing's fast-growing that's exactly it and
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:57.800]  and then for other technologies like cell phones where you're placing them
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:04.000]  against your head the skull thickness is half at age five of an adult and so
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.560]  or less than half so you have a lot more energy transiting into the brain and so
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:12.600]  there's lots of physical characteristics with children that affect them much
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:16.920]  differently than adults particularly when you're considering these new forces
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:22.000]  of concern good question bill Donna and Louisiana you're on the air worldwide
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  yes hello Alex yes okay nice to talk to you thank you for all you do and thank
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:35.720]  you dr. baggage as well I was wondering about empathy jeans pertinent to what
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.960]  you were talking about earlier they did some studies several years ago I know
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:44.640]  five ten years ago I remember at wondering why at the time they were
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:50.120]  interested in such a thing but this may play into some of your discussion about
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:57.080]  mind control and fear and the empathy that we have that they're trying to
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:00.840]  press or something we know the Pentagon has been working on turning off empathy
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:04.480]  to have got a biological android I mean who needs a terminator machine when
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:08.440]  you've got a human that's had their thinking process turned off dr. baggage
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:12.480]  yeah absolutely in fact there's a lot of work being done now because of post
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:17.400]  traumatic stress and syndrome of wiping out memory now I would be very concerned
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:22.000]  about this because of several reasons one is you wipe the memory clean on the
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.040]  surface you may not wipe it out in other words you continue to play with it in
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:31.560]  your subconscious which could lead to huge huge and new forms of psychosis the
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:35.600]  other thing is is what if all those troops were involved in some illegal
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:40.320]  immoral unethical evil activity that normal human beings wouldn't
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:44.280]  participate in which is why they're experiencing post traumatic stress
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:47.920]  syndrome and that what you're trying to do is wipe out their memory so you can
[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:52.800]  deny that whatever they saw participated never happened that's that's my
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:56.160]  that's like studies show that people don't get very depressed when they see
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:29:00.240]  killing is something that was in defense or righteous but your body your brain
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:04.960]  actually attacks you if it thinks you've done bad even if you've rationalized
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:09.600]  consciously your subconscious wants to kill you yeah and it it's you know I
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:13.720]  think we're playing in an area that is very very dangerous you know trying to
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:20.240]  wipe out a memory rather than deal with what it is that has changed person you
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:23.640]  know we do the same thing with in this country you every day with with chemicals
[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:27.200]  issued by doctors instead of people sitting down with counselors getting to
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:31.640]  the root of their problems now we want to just wipe out the memory so we can
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:35.680]  excuse bad behavior I don't think it's a good idea knock I won't keep you any
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:40.280]  longer after the break just we'll just do two minutes and plug earth pulse and
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:43.520]  your work and how folks can support it and we'll let you go they'll get into
[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:46.800]  all the big news folks and more your calls stay with us we'll be right back
[02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:50.040]  info wars.com and their side of course we'll give you on the other side of this
[02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:56.960]  break we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:56.960 --> 02:30:04.280]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:08.600]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:12.720]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:16.640]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:20.280]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:24.840]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:29.480]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:33.240]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:30:33.240 --> 02:30:36.720]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:40.640]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:43.800]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:47.640]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can
[02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:52.280]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:53.160]  were created to lift each other up that is our obligation to the creation

[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:31.440]  reach not even recharge just just more more informative and insightful than
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:36.560]  ever and everybody either people are giving in more to evil and corruption
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:41.560]  and getting more into that or they're getting more into freedom and liberty and
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:46.040]  I I can just feel it every day I can hardly contain myself I mean but then
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:49.400]  it's also very frustrating to see all the corruption and bad things growing as
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:57.400]  well and and I don't even so much get angry as I just get motivated to sweep
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:02.080]  these people aside because I can just see them I can tell you they're weak I
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:06.120]  know they're bad and it's because we haven't stepped into who we really are
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:11.760]  that they've been able to get away with this it is a joke it is a joke it's like
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:20.760]  watching an ant whip an elephant and it that is absolutely backwards okay when I
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:25.000]  see stories like this it it makes my mind as I said in the first hour
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.840]  explode in a thousand fractals of understanding it's like a shaken bake
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:41.080]  it's like box made brownies or biscuits I mean all you do is add milk it's it's a
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:47.560]  prepackaged tropism it's always done the same how do we know different terrorist
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:52.280]  stage we look at it it has all the same characteristics the patsies the people
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.480]  being protected the the setups they're giving them the passports their their
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:37:07.480]  boss being Pentagon run and when I saw the bombing in Egypt over the weekend I
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:12.960]  was I was please let it be real Muslim terrorists please please that's much less
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:18.320]  scary in my gut than knowing the government's doing it please please please
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:24.200]  please please let 911 be the way they say it is but it isn't and it's always the
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:28.560]  same story they were being protected the police had folks evacuate there was
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:32.680]  inside knowledge government intelligence was involved it's always the same
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:38.000]  they're gonna use it as a crackdown measure I mean you think I'm happy that
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:43.240]  and we're all a locky one of the top Al Qaeda people is admittedly a Pentagon
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:50.280]  secret asset and running the attacks I mean I'm not concerned about about a
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:55.560]  bunch of rag tag idiots running around in the desert rag tag idiots can't pull
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:00.280]  off 9-11 ladies and gentlemen they didn't okay and it's the same thing this
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:10.000]  top Pentagon aid to Bush senior and junior and Reagan involved in all sorts
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  of very suspicious things who done research on him in the White House in
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:26.560]  the Pentagon he's found in a trash can that was then dumped into a landfill now
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:32.120]  in fami Malik fame the Arkansas medical examiner they they killed people that is
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:35.680]  someone in the government killed people and then fami Malik would declare it
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:39.400]  suicide when they've been shot arms and legs got off I mean ridiculous stuff
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:43.120]  okay you like seeing I cut my own arms and legs off then put myself in a trunk
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:50.440]  and and through the Atlantic Ocean it's impossible but a few days ago we
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:58.400]  learned he's dead dead in a landfill and now they want to imply that he was a
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:03.920]  bad guy showing that he must have gotten some information out to the media or
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:14.680]  somebody and now they want to discredit him now they want to discredit him ahead
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:20.360]  of that info coming out now now get ready for this this has drugged up mind
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:28.320]  control written all over it that's what it has written all over it or something
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:32.120]  similar because it's always the same MO they always do stuff like this
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:37.960]  disoriented and wearing at just one shoe bizarre last sighting of top
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:45.040]  White House aid found murdered and dumped in a landfill top Pentagon aid found
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.560]  dead at a landfill site was seen in a confused state 48 hours before his
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:55.080]  death wandering around the car park and wearing only one shoe John Wheeler was
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:58.000]  disoriented and not wearing a coat despite the freezing temperature
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.280]  according to the car park attendant in Wilmington Delaware asked if he felt
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:07.800]  okay the 66 year old simply replied no the following day he was also
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:11.200]  seen wandering around the town in the last sighting before his body was
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:19.560]  discovered dumped into the landfill now he gets even more insane this is out
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:27.760]  today the 5th of January 2011 here's the next one man found in landfill tied to
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:33.840]  arson attempt John P. Wheeler the third planet incendiary devices that neighbors
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:37.320]  home in Delaware days before his disappearance and this is from the
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:42.000]  Delaware police do you believe any of this I mean I hope they don't find
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.800]  yours truly dead in a landfill sometime and then claim I put bombs in my
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:50.640]  neighbor's house now he's a terrorist if you really believe this now he's Al
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:56.400]  Kida what do I go to Walmart and reporting to big sis police found
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:01.720]  evidence leaking John Pete Parsons Wheeler the third the devices planted
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:05.400]  at the Newcastle home of a neighbor with whom he had been feuding said the
[02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:08.760]  source he was close to the investigation and then on top of it he's
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:14.000]  running around drooling in the freezing temperature with one shoe they got him
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.720]  drugged him up threw him back out of the car and then somebody else said just go
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:21.360]  ahead and kill that guy the feud was over the size of the neighbor's house
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:25.320]  which was under construction in the city's historic district yeah I bet I
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:30.680]  mean who writes this stuff who makes this stuff up now it'll all be about him
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:35.600]  being an arsonist instead of who killed him and throw him in a stinking landfill
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:41.480]  now they're showing surveillance footage of him wandering around the source
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:45.720]  emphasized that the evidence does not shed light on the murder itself but has
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:48.840]  helped detectives understand Wheeler state of mind before he disappeared yeah
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:55.800]  sure both the detectives are just absolutely sure that he planted a bomb
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:04.320]  I mean this is ridiculous this is fogging up you know the whole discussion
[02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:09.640]  Wheeler was found dead in a landfill on Friday and the police are trying to
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:15.800]  retrace his movements between December 28th and then that's good with the video
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:22.800]  guys thanks continuing here the case is draw national attention Newark police
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:28.120]  receive roughly 70 media calls Tuesday because Wheeler 66 lived such a
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:33.760]  distinguished public life oh he was so distinguished until he wasn't wearing a
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:38.680]  shoe or a coat outside and was acting crazy
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:44.880]  guy running for his life probably is what happened and boy they got him and to
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:49.680]  make sure everybody knows mr. Wheeler is a bad man involved in all the key
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:55.120]  Pentagon operations why would he plant those bombs or maybe he was mind
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:59.080]  control the whole time and blew a gasket you don't know you don't know with
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:05.640]  these people the sky is the limit but it's got black ops written all over it
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:11.080]  people are like oh that's a conspiracy theory where else does it go where else
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:16.080]  does it point running around like he's out of his mind not wearing a shoe and
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:23.880]  freezing arctic weather for days bombs at people's houses bush aid found in a
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:34.800]  landfill I remember having the DC madam on a few months before she was killed and
[02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:40.040]  I told her I said if you know more stuff about the Johns that your went with
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:45.200]  your women were seeing top brass White House you name it is reportedly what was
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:52.560]  in there you better tell people right now and she's like no I'm gonna hold on to
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:59.360]  all of that and then I called her landlord at the condo she owned and she
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:02.480]  wasn't gonna kill herself she said she was being followed she was going to hide
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:08.720]  the stuff with her mommy and they hung her in the garage it didn't matter if I
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:13.840]  had audio tapes of her live on air saying she never killed herself old friends
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:16.640]  went on the news with no evidence and said that she said she was gonna kill
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:25.720]  herself mm-hmm we tell you something I will never commit suicide never never
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:31.320]  never never never never and anybody that pops up and says that I told him I
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:35.320]  was that person's a stinking new world order piece of trash I want that on
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:44.000]  record right now okay I love life I've got total gusto for it so much I love
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:48.280]  life so much I want to put myself in the crosshairs for everybody including my
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:54.760]  children because people before me did it so we'd have some basic dignity I'm in
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:59.520]  love with life I'm in love with creation I'm in love with everything good I know
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:03.120]  how to recognize what's wholesome this new world order is the opposite of wholesome
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:05.520]  and I don't like it
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:13.680]  oh my gosh all right I said I'd get into the news here it is this was pointed
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:16.240]  out by jaren has been doing a bunch of research on it today I've sent it over
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:19.040]  the Watson brothers and one of them chooses to do a story
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:30.680]  starless side or gold toxic is a chemical that's used to kill European
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:36.000]  starlings and gulls but less toxic to other birds and mammals and it's got
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:44.400]  restricted use and jaren looked at 99 2000 2008 2009 constant scandals with
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:49.120]  starless side killing birds and it's sprayed for some reason in December and
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:53.520]  January dealing with soybeans which are grown heavily in Arkansas and
[02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:57.840]  surrounding areas but the state could be covering up that it was used and saying
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:03.120]  oh they didn't die from any poison but could starless side liquefy their organs
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:10.440]  I doubt it needs to be looked into but something that jaren dug up there and
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:13.600]  that is important we know they use restricted pesticides all the time
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:16.720]  without authorization it would be the first time the state covered it up
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:24.320]  because the states are caught all the time using restricted pesticides okay
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:27.520]  let me just look there's only one way to get to all this news I'll just go through
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:30.960]  it stack by stack because it's all out of control in here leak document EPA
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:37.480]  knowingly approved be killing pesticide that's confirmed by natural news and it
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:44.080]  goes to the fact that they knew that the pesticide cloth E anodin cloth E anodin
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:49.400]  would wipe out honey bees but the EPA quietly gave authorization for it to be
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:52.560]  used nationwide and it's used in Europe and those are the main zones where the
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:57.960]  honey bees are dying in mass along with most species of bumblebee which pollinate
[02:46:57.960 --> 02:47:01.960]  the plants but corporations don't care they'd rather tax your carbon dioxide
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:05.680]  that plants breathe instead of caring about anything serious open air clones
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:11.080]  open air cloned animals toxic waste everywhere chemical warfare biological
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:15.240]  weapons genetic engineering mouse pox flu shots everywhere all these dangerous
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:18.160]  things all these mutagens let's not worry about that let's worry about
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:23.800]  mother's milk to the earth carbon dioxide just absolute buffoonery get all
[02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:26.600]  the hippies worried about something that doesn't matter instead of all these real
[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:32.600]  crises whatever whatever they want to do that's it mass bird and fish die off
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:37.040]  go global spark in times panic Brazil Sweden New Zealand hit with strange
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:41.920]  phenomenon as speculation rages key article by Paul Joseph Watson boiling
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:46.720]  all of that down why are the animals dying birds fish wiped out in mysterious
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:53.200]  deaths Mike Adams got a good report on that Victorian River up in Canada turns
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:58.400]  bright green very mysterious don't know what's going on with that humans have
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:01.480]  intentionally modified weather for military purposes and climate control
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:05.440]  for decades so how do we know all this freak weather written caused by that or
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:08.360]  chain reactions from weather modification the answer is a lot of it is
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:13.200]  caused by that and we've seen a lot of floods and things in the past have been
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:16.680]  connected directly to army testing and Navy testing right here where I live in
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:20.560]  Texas it came out and about 12 years ago in the San Antonio Express News they
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:25.680]  caused a bunch of floods so that continues this is just one stack I got
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:31.320]  like 10 I'm never gonna get to all this so that's an important area here's
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:35.640]  another report New York City Blizzard feds open criminal probe into alleged
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:40.000]  city worker conspiracy during storm response it's been confirmed that they
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:46.600]  had a Union slowdown you know how do you do that when people are dying can't you
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:56.440]  have your protest some other time but it it's just insane continuing oh no not
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:49:02.240]  another ice age and even Fox News covered this this is a report here from
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:10.880]  IMVA about how incredibly accurate the predictions were of Pierce Corbin we had
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:15.320]  him on here early last year he predicted exactly what happened dealing with the
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:19.920]  solar winds and also magnetic effects of the earth in relationship to moon
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:24.920]  cycles amazing and there's a lot of reports about how devastatingly accurate
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:30.640]  he is we're gonna be getting him on but the government's answer is oh this is
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.280]  global warming causing the cold temperatures in 1,000 years in Europe
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:39.720]  in the United States in many other areas incredible article London Guardian the
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:44.400]  Tories are gonna turn over the national parts of England completely for private

[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:13.960]  doesn't exist that's their total contempt for you as long as your

[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:26.480]  got to most of you we'll be back tomorrow live and I've got to get to the
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:30.520]  satellites that they claim were to stop global warming that were to analyze it
[02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:34.640]  and now the wiki leaks and the Germans have admitted it's true working with the
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:39.880]  US government their pure spy satellites infrared now what they don't tell you is
[02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:45.200]  the big secret weapon is on the ground they get an infrared scan of your body
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:51.600]  from passive cameras they then attach it with a face scan integrated in that they
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:54.920]  already have from your digital photo and your passport or your driver's license
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:55:00.200]  now they have your heat resonance then they create a model of that from the top
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:04.960]  of your body and off your heat signature from your shoulders and the top of your
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:09.920]  head they can identify you from space and that's what this is really all about
[02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:13.120]  and that's the big secret weapon Bob Woodward talked about that he wouldn't
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:21.360]  tell you what it was over in Iraq and they've also got other wavelength systems
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:26.600]  that send out but basically a sonar wave that goes through your clothes then
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:30.880]  they could scan a 360 your body but they need a biometric scan that's what the
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:35.920]  naked body scanners are for one use is to get that 360 bio scan and I told you
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:40.200]  that two years ago and now it's even the Wall Street Journal told you that look
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:45.320]  I know what they're doing okay I can just and it's disgusting and but oh it's
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:51.640]  for the earth and global warming satellites it's all lies something
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:56.640]  really important Ventura confirmed that Homeland Security and others threatened
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:01.200]  Time Warner so they removed his show the police state episode that breaks down the
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:05.640]  whole takeover plan they had a hole in one we had a hole in one I was a big
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:09.320]  consultant on that very proud of that episode and that's why I freaked out when
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:13.000]  actually air and I called Ventura that night congratulated him and I called
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.720]  them all we talked about it and couldn't believe it got on air and then they
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:21.600]  took it off they're now remotely erasing it off of DVR's and it's confirmed
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:25.400]  they're doing it so and they're now starting to erase the JFK and Wall
[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:30.960]  Street and water they do not want this scene they're erasing it off YouTube as
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:35.720]  well that we found some sites that do have it and in pretty good quality and
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:40.600]  it's up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com this cost around 300
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:47.640]  grand to make so it's a 45-minute show and they are very upset about this okay
[02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:54.480]  this episode shows you the total martial law the 10 FEMA governors this really
[02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:58.440]  upset Homeland Security I mean there were all sorts of things I can't talk
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:02.720]  about that went on with this men in black showing up people being broken too
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:06.240]  I'm just gonna leave it at that in fact I'm not even supposed to I'm gonna shut
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:10.480]  up now they're pretty freaked out there probably won't be a show next year
