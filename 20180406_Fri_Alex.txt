[00:00.000 --> 00:14.880]  Live from the InfraWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now
[00:14.880 --> 00:17.800]  your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:17.800 --> 00:25.880]  We're live, it is Friday, April 6th edition of the Alex Jones show, I'm Paul Joseph
[00:25.880 --> 00:29.280]  Watson in for Alex Jones in this first hour.
[00:29.280 --> 00:34.280]  In the second hour, we've got the full on-air Ted Nugent interview coming up.
[00:34.280 --> 00:37.280]  Of course, you've seen clips of it, he's talking about gun control, he's talking about
[00:37.280 --> 00:39.080]  a threat to the Second Amendment.
[00:39.080 --> 00:43.360]  The full interview, which has not yet been seen by anyone, will air in the second hour,
[00:43.360 --> 00:45.680]  so be sure to stay tuned for that.
[00:45.680 --> 00:50.560]  In the meantime, we've got a raft of news, obviously this caravan coming from Mexico,
[00:50.560 --> 00:53.920]  the Central American immigrants has been turned back to the time being, it looks like it's
[00:53.920 --> 00:59.920]  been disbanded, but the fallout at least rhetorically continues, there was a CNN panel, and we're
[00:59.920 --> 01:05.000]  going to go to this video in the next segment, which basically said Trump must have been
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.800]  watching Alex Jones because of his comments on this caravan, and in particular his comments
[01:10.800 --> 01:15.680]  regarding the connection between illegal immigrants and rape, which by the way is a completely
[01:15.680 --> 01:21.480]  proven connection not by Breitbart, not by Fox News, not by InfraWars, but by The Huffington
[01:21.480 --> 01:25.400]  Post, not quite renowned as a far right outlet, is it?
[01:25.400 --> 01:31.040]  But you had CNN panelists up there saying that Trump said this in his remarks yesterday
[01:31.040 --> 01:34.720]  when he went off script because he's been talking or listening or watching too much
[01:34.720 --> 01:36.600]  of Alex Jones.
[01:36.600 --> 01:41.240]  We'll get into the true facts behind that, we also have a Young Turks co-host who says
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.880]  that Donald Trump could stage, or at least he suggests that it could happen.
[01:45.880 --> 01:52.280]  He could see a terrorist attack or a conveniently timed war before the midterms to help the
[01:52.280 --> 01:58.120]  Republicans try and regain or retain at least the House of Congress, of course the so-called
[01:58.120 --> 02:01.560]  blue wave is expected by everyone.
[02:01.560 --> 02:06.280]  This Young Turks co-host says that that might not happen, and it might not happen because
[02:06.280 --> 02:11.680]  Donald Trump could take advantage of or he could, I mean the suggestion is quite conspiratorial
[02:11.680 --> 02:16.160]  here, if this was an InfraWars.com article, they'd be calling us conspiracy theorists,
[02:16.160 --> 02:20.560]  but they can write about it in CNBC, and no one bats an eyelid, so we're going to get
[02:20.560 --> 02:23.000]  into that as well.
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.200]  Now Breitbart yesterday had its big masters of the universe town hall about big tech
[02:28.200 --> 02:33.560]  censorship, social media, monopolies, and one of the participants in that forum, Robert
[02:33.560 --> 02:38.240]  Epstein, who is a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research
[02:38.240 --> 02:44.800]  and Technology, came up with some very interesting comments about how Google changed its algorithm,
[02:44.800 --> 02:49.000]  and you can bet your bottom dollar they're still doing this today, and they'll intensify
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  it up until the midterms.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.200]  They changed their algorithm deliberately to make the search results positive for, you
[02:56.200 --> 02:58.520]  guessed it, Hillary Clinton.
[02:58.520 --> 03:04.920]  Now this is not a right-wing guy, this is an academic voice telling us this, Google
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.000]  algorithms can change millions of votes, that's been proven, this is going to be a huge issue,
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.320]  big tech censorship and algorithm manipulation going into the midterms, and this guy's sounding
[03:15.320 --> 03:19.120]  the alarm bell about it once again, so we'll get into that.
[03:19.120 --> 03:25.040]  Now in the UK last night we had six, or in London we had 16 ages stabbed within 90 minutes
[03:25.040 --> 03:26.200]  of each other.
[03:26.200 --> 03:29.200]  This violent crime on the streets of London is getting out of control.
[03:29.200 --> 03:35.920]  We know now that London, at least in February, has been more violent in terms of murders
[03:35.920 --> 03:37.800]  than New York City.
[03:37.800 --> 03:43.960]  Same population, London more violent, 16 ages stabbed within 90 minutes of each other last
[03:43.960 --> 03:44.960]  night.
[03:44.960 --> 03:49.000]  Nigel Farage has come out and said this is due to political correctness, this is due to
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.920]  stop and search being reduced, but what is the government blaming it on?
[03:52.920 --> 03:55.000]  They're blaming it on social media.
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.480]  Again, Sadiq Khan's been besotted, been obsessed with mean tweets for the past year, he's
[04:00.480 --> 04:05.080]  been obsessed with transgender bathrooms, meanwhile we have an actual crime wave unfolding
[04:05.080 --> 04:07.920]  on the streets, nothing's being done about it.
[04:07.920 --> 04:12.080]  They sent out a tweet earlier saying, oh please don't carry knives, yeah, like that's going
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.080]  to solve the problem.
[04:13.080 --> 04:14.480]  It's not going to solve the problem.
[04:14.480 --> 04:18.840]  You need people on patrol, you need bobbies on patrol, you need stop and search, that's
[04:18.840 --> 04:20.040]  been removed.
[04:20.040 --> 04:26.120]  Meanwhile, they've got 900 plus specialist officers patrolling hate crime, otherwise
[04:26.120 --> 04:32.240]  known as mean tweets, so they got plenty of resources for that, not so many resources
[04:32.240 --> 04:33.240]  for actual crime.
[04:33.240 --> 04:37.360]  And remember, this is a police force, the Metropolitan Police, that basically told us
[04:37.360 --> 04:41.960]  a few months ago, they can't investigate all crimes, but they can investigate all mean
[04:41.960 --> 04:42.960]  tweets.
[04:42.960 --> 04:47.120]  They can't really investigate because they don't have the resources to investigate or
[04:47.120 --> 04:51.600]  stop the wave of stabbings that are plaguing the streets of London, we'll get into it after
[04:51.600 --> 04:52.600]  the break.
[04:52.600 --> 05:00.400]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live, breaking news at infowars.com, we'll be back.
[05:00.400 --> 05:05.040]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[05:05.040 --> 05:09.000]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.840]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[05:12.840 --> 05:16.640]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[05:16.640 --> 05:18.480]  particles in the gut.
[05:18.480 --> 05:20.920]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[05:20.920 --> 05:25.040]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[05:25.040 --> 05:28.040]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[05:28.040 --> 05:32.600]  You can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[05:32.600 --> 05:35.380]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[05:35.380 --> 05:39.600]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[05:39.600 --> 05:43.560]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[05:43.560 --> 05:47.880]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so
[05:47.880 --> 05:50.160]  you can fully digest all types of meals.
[05:50.160 --> 05:54.640]  Don't let a meal go to waste, use carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[05:54.640 --> 06:07.280]  Head to infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now, that's infowarslife.com.
[06:07.280 --> 06:16.080]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show and now your host, Paul
[06:16.080 --> 06:17.080]  Joseph Watson.
[06:17.080 --> 06:25.360]  Well, I've, it is the Alex Jones Show now yesterday, you probably saw Donald Trump
[06:25.360 --> 06:30.080]  go off script during a tax round table event in West Virginia.
[06:30.080 --> 06:33.600]  He was supposed to be talking about tax reduction, he did for a while, but then he ripped up
[06:33.600 --> 06:38.360]  the script, he started talking about illegal immigration, and he made comments about the
[06:38.360 --> 06:44.080]  connection between rape and illegal immigration, once again causing a firestorm of controversy.
[06:44.080 --> 06:46.240]  But not everything is as it seems.
[06:46.240 --> 06:48.680]  First, let's go to this Donald Trump clip.
[06:48.680 --> 06:54.000]  This is Trump in West Virginia yesterday, talking, it was at a tax round table ostensibly,
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.680]  but then he delved into something slightly more controversial.
[06:57.680 --> 06:58.680]  Here's the clip.
[06:58.680 --> 07:03.920]  A lottery system, pick them out, a lottery system, you can imagine what those countries
[07:03.920 --> 07:10.720]  put into the system, they're not putting their good ones, and remember my opening remarks
[07:10.720 --> 07:17.880]  at Trump Tower when I opened, everybody said, oh, he was so tough, and I used the word rape.
[07:17.880 --> 07:23.800]  And yesterday it came out where this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that
[07:23.800 --> 07:26.200]  nobody's ever seen before.
[07:26.200 --> 07:28.440]  They don't want to mention that.
[07:28.440 --> 07:34.600]  So we have to change our laws, and the Democrats, what they're doing is just, it's insanity.
[07:34.600 --> 07:37.680]  I don't, nobody understands what's going on.
[07:37.680 --> 07:42.680]  Now, those are Trump's comments yesterday, of course, he went off script, but this caused
[07:42.680 --> 07:46.520]  a firestorm on CNN, what a surprise that is.
[07:46.520 --> 07:51.200]  They had a round table, they were absolutely stunned that Trump would dare return to these
[07:51.200 --> 07:55.840]  comments about the link between rape and illegal immigrants, particularly the ones coming in
[07:55.840 --> 07:56.840]  from Mexico.
[07:56.840 --> 08:01.360]  And of course, this was a big thing during the 2015 presidential campaign, where Trump
[08:01.360 --> 08:06.600]  said, you know, the classic quote, they're bringing in drugs, they're bringing in rapists.
[08:06.600 --> 08:08.080]  CNN got triggered by this.
[08:08.080 --> 08:12.320]  They accused Trump of listening or watching too much Alex Jones.
[08:12.320 --> 08:13.640]  Let's go to that clip.
[08:13.640 --> 08:18.400]  You know, in the bigger picture, I wonder, I mean, there is this Senate race in West
[08:18.400 --> 08:24.880]  Virginia, sure, Josh, but he also revived his claim about rapists that he was excoriated
[08:24.880 --> 08:31.920]  for, certainly not by his base, not by his diehard supporters, in his announcement address
[08:31.920 --> 08:33.920]  speech.
[08:33.920 --> 08:35.520]  And he just revived that as well.
[08:35.520 --> 08:40.840]  I mean, this is just Trump, it's what he does, I mean, he is not, you know, doesn't
[08:40.840 --> 08:47.960]  tie himself to standards of fact and objectivity in the way that any other Republican or Democratic
[08:47.960 --> 08:48.960]  politician would.
[08:48.960 --> 08:53.600]  He simply decides to believe these things, maybe saw them on Fox News, you know, I don't
[08:53.600 --> 08:58.160]  know, maybe he's watching Alex Jones, but his habit is to continue to repeat them regardless
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.400]  of them being consistently disproven by the media.
[09:02.400 --> 09:06.680]  So they have a CNN panelist saying that Trump's claim that there's any connection between rape
[09:06.680 --> 09:10.120]  and illegal immigrants coming from Mexico is completely disproven.
[09:10.120 --> 09:15.280]  He's saying that Trump's got that information, maybe from Fox News, maybe from Alex Jones.
[09:15.280 --> 09:18.320]  Well, turns out that's not quite the case.
[09:18.320 --> 09:24.960]  Huffington Post headline 2014, if you can punch this up, 80% of Central American women girls
[09:24.960 --> 09:27.960]  are raped crossing into the US.
[09:27.960 --> 09:32.520]  This is exactly what Trump was talking about in the comments we just played.
[09:32.520 --> 09:37.520]  So no, it's not Fox News, it's not Alex Jones, it's the Huffington Post telling everyone
[09:37.520 --> 09:38.520]  that.
[09:38.520 --> 09:43.760]  Hardly the far right outlet that they tried to paint it as on that CNN panel.
[09:43.760 --> 09:46.760]  And the article states there's a number of Central American women and girls crossing
[09:46.760 --> 09:47.760]  into the US.
[09:47.760 --> 09:49.760]  And by the way, these numbers are probably even worse now.
[09:49.760 --> 09:52.800]  This is 2014 continues to spike.
[09:52.800 --> 09:56.840]  So is the staggering amount of sexual violence waged against these migrants who are in search
[09:56.840 --> 09:58.680]  of a better life.
[09:58.680 --> 10:04.400]  So they tried to make out on CNN that Trump was talking about this caravan of migrants,
[10:04.400 --> 10:07.000]  which reportedly is mainly women and children.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.680]  We don't know that for sure, but obviously many of them amongst them.
[10:10.680 --> 10:13.800]  They tried to imply that Trump was calling those people rapists.
[10:13.800 --> 10:19.440]  No, you saying they're the victims because 80% as the Huffington Post reported of women
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.320]  and girls crossing into the US by the way of Mexico are raped during their journey.
[10:25.320 --> 10:30.640]  That's up from a previous estimate of 60% according to an Amnesty International report.
[10:30.640 --> 10:36.840]  So they go through these numbers and many of these rapes aren't even being reported.
[10:36.840 --> 10:41.640]  And they explain that because they have to pay the bandits to get through the country
[10:41.640 --> 10:46.120]  in the first place, so it's part of the transaction just for them to survive and make it through.
[10:46.120 --> 10:48.720]  So they're not going to be reporting all of the rapes.
[10:48.720 --> 10:53.760]  Now it was 60%, it was 80% in 2014.
[10:53.760 --> 10:55.360]  God knows what it is now.
[10:55.360 --> 10:58.040]  But again, this is from the Huffington Post.
[10:58.040 --> 11:05.320]  So CNN claims that Trump's claim that this is off the scale, women, young girls getting
[11:05.320 --> 11:09.680]  raped as they go up through Mexico, they're saying that's a conspiracy theory that Trump
[11:09.680 --> 11:16.040]  has dredged out of the sewer of Fox News or Alex Jones or InfoWars, it's in the Huffington
[11:16.040 --> 11:17.040]  Post.
[11:17.040 --> 11:22.960]  80% of women and girls crossing into the US by way of Mexico are raped during their
[11:22.960 --> 11:23.960]  journey.
[11:23.960 --> 11:30.560]  Eleanor Goldberg 2014 Huffington Post, not Fox News, not Alex Jones.
[11:30.560 --> 11:34.720]  Other government statistics, and you can find these in the article, shocked CNN panel says
[11:34.720 --> 11:39.160]  Trump is watching Alex Jones upon infowars.com.
[11:39.160 --> 11:42.640]  Other government statistics show that illegal aliens in the US commit federal crimes at
[11:42.640 --> 11:46.360]  three times the rate of citizens.
[11:46.360 --> 11:50.760]  Now this is an important distinction to make because often what we hear from the left is
[11:50.760 --> 11:57.840]  that immigrants, all immigrants commit less crimes than citizens.
[11:57.840 --> 12:02.800]  And while it's true, according to some statistics, that legal immigrants commit less crimes than
[12:02.800 --> 12:06.600]  American citizens, which is a good thing, they're adhering to the law, which is how
[12:06.600 --> 12:09.560]  they got into the country legally in the first place.
[12:09.560 --> 12:16.160]  What they don't say is that illegal immigrants commit three times the amount of federal crimes.
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.600]  They pass that out and they take the statistic of all migrants, including legal ones, to
[12:21.600 --> 12:22.600]  downplay the problem.
[12:22.600 --> 12:28.200]  Well, obviously there's a problem if 80% of women and young girls as they come up through
[12:28.200 --> 12:31.760]  Mexico are being raped and sexually assaulted.
[12:31.760 --> 12:35.560]  Many of them use it as a form of payment to be able to get through the country in the
[12:35.560 --> 12:37.680]  first place.
[12:37.680 --> 12:42.440]  Goldberg in the Huffington Palace continues again, not Fox News, not Alex Jones, quote,
[12:42.440 --> 12:47.800]  the assaults are so common that many women and girls take contraceptives beforehand as
[12:47.800 --> 12:50.680]  preventative measures.
[12:50.680 --> 12:52.160]  So they expect it.
[12:52.160 --> 12:57.280]  They're taking contraceptives with them before the journey begins because it's so likely
[12:57.280 --> 13:00.840]  that they're going to get sexually assaulted and raped.
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.600]  She also notes the situation is probably even worse because many victims are too afraid
[13:04.600 --> 13:06.640]  to report the rapes.
[13:06.640 --> 13:10.880]  So again, Trump doesn't need to watch Alex Jones to understand that Mexico has a huge
[13:10.880 --> 13:12.040]  rape problem.
[13:12.040 --> 13:16.680]  He could just have easily read it in one of the most distinctly left-wing news outlets
[13:16.680 --> 13:19.560]  in the country, the Huffington Post.
[13:19.560 --> 13:23.120]  So now it's not a Fox News, Alex Jones talking point.
[13:23.120 --> 13:27.320]  It's widely reported that these migrants, women and children are the victims of rape
[13:27.320 --> 13:30.680]  in a vast majority of cases, 80%.
[13:30.680 --> 13:31.960]  This is a big problem.
[13:31.960 --> 13:35.480]  And you can't just blame it on Infowars or Alex Jones.
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.040]  And of course, many of these people are illegally coming into America as well, which is why
[13:40.040 --> 13:44.440]  we have so many cases of rapes on the border.
[13:44.440 --> 13:47.720]  You've seen numerous cases about it in the media over the past six months.
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.640]  It seems to have uptick a little bit, but you see them reported every single week.
[13:51.640 --> 13:52.640]  It's a big problem.
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.360]  But again, the media, CNN is not going to accurately report on that or tell you about
[13:57.360 --> 13:58.360]  it.
[13:58.360 --> 13:59.360]  They're going to spin it.
[13:59.360 --> 14:02.920]  Donald Trump ditches White House Correspondents' Dinner again.
[14:02.920 --> 14:05.360]  The press is so bad, so fake.
[14:05.360 --> 14:06.920]  This just came out a few hours ago.
[14:06.920 --> 14:09.960]  President Donald Trump has turned down an invitation to the White House Correspondents'
[14:09.960 --> 14:12.440]  Dinner for the second consecutive year.
[14:12.440 --> 14:16.520]  Well, what a surprise that is, isn't it amazing, by the way, that Trump, what was it in the
[14:16.520 --> 14:17.520]  Rasmussen poll?
[14:17.520 --> 14:18.520]  He's up to 51%.
[14:18.520 --> 14:25.240]  Better than Obama at the same time during his first term, 51%, despite the overwhelming
[14:25.240 --> 14:26.720]  negative media coverage.
[14:26.720 --> 14:32.560]  And in fact, there was another poll which found that 77% of Americans believe the mainstream
[14:32.560 --> 14:35.760]  media engages in, quote, fake news.
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.960]  So he's at 51% in Rasmussen, which they say, oh, that's a Republican bias poll.
[14:40.960 --> 14:43.440]  Well, yeah, all the other polls are Democrat bias.
[14:43.440 --> 14:47.280]  You have weighted samples vastly in Democrats' favor.
[14:47.280 --> 14:50.240]  So Rasmussen is actually quite fair in how it weights the polls.
[14:50.240 --> 14:52.720]  So he's up to 51% on that.
[14:52.720 --> 14:58.240]  And if he hadn't had the, what was it, the 95% negative media coverage over the past
[14:58.240 --> 15:03.000]  year plus, where he would be in the polls, and even now with some of the base getting
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.400]  antsy with Trump over his failure to get the wall up and running, he's still at 51%.
[15:09.400 --> 15:15.360]  So why on earth would he extend an olive branch to the media and go to this White House Correspondents'
[15:15.360 --> 15:17.000]  Dinner?
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.320]  Trump announced the news on Friday morning in an interview with Bernie and Sid Radio Show
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.080]  in New York City who said this, quote, I sort of feel that the press is so bad, so fake,
[15:26.080 --> 15:27.080]  it's so made up.
[15:27.080 --> 15:28.480]  I call them novelists.
[15:28.480 --> 15:29.480]  They make up the sources.
[15:29.480 --> 15:32.360]  In many cases, they literally make up sources.
[15:32.360 --> 15:36.280]  I just think I want to get it straightened out with the press before I go.
[15:36.280 --> 15:41.080]  So he will not attend for the second year running and really nobody's going to care.
[15:41.080 --> 15:45.920]  I mean, this event has received less and less attention, less feedback for many years now.
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.800]  It's dwindling into obscurity and Trump is rightly going to ignore it once again.
[15:50.800 --> 15:54.880]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live in the next segment in 4Wars.com.
[15:54.880 --> 16:24.800]  Don't go away.

[18:04.280 --> 18:09.400]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[18:09.400 --> 18:13.440]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:13.440 --> 18:17.800]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.800 --> 18:23.120]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[18:23.120 --> 18:29.520]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.040]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and
[18:34.040 --> 18:36.520]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[18:36.520 --> 18:41.080]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[18:41.080 --> 18:43.640]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[18:43.640 --> 18:48.040]  Brought by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[18:48.040 --> 18:51.560]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[18:51.560 --> 18:56.480]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[18:56.480 --> 18:57.840]  my favorite coffee.
[18:57.840 --> 19:00.360]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[19:00.360 --> 19:05.640]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[19:05.640 --> 19:10.800]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[19:10.800 --> 19:17.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[19:17.640 --> 19:23.480]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[19:23.480 --> 19:26.840]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:26.840 --> 19:31.760]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[19:31.760 --> 19:38.120]  of this research a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[19:38.120 --> 19:41.680]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[19:41.680 --> 19:46.440]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[19:46.440 --> 19:52.240]  triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:52.240 --> 19:54.960]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:54.960 --> 20:10.280]  Visit infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:10.280 --> 20:28.240]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your
[20:28.240 --> 20:31.680]  host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[20:31.680 --> 20:38.520]  We are live on the Alex Jones show, remember that Ted Nugent interview?
[20:38.520 --> 20:41.080]  The full interview is coming up in the second hour.
[20:41.080 --> 20:43.920]  Before we get back into the news, I want to tell you about some of the great specials
[20:43.920 --> 20:47.440]  we have available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[20:47.440 --> 20:49.120]  Of course, you've seen Alex talk about it.
[20:49.120 --> 20:54.760]  He's got the big national press club speech press conference coming up next week.
[20:54.760 --> 20:57.640]  We basically get hit by a lawsuit every week at this point.
[20:57.640 --> 21:00.520]  It's their new method of undermining us.
[21:00.520 --> 21:02.560]  It's the new purge.
[21:02.560 --> 21:05.160]  They tried to censor us, they tried to smear our characters.
[21:05.160 --> 21:08.560]  Now it's frivolous lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit.
[21:08.560 --> 21:11.120]  We're defeating them, but it's because we have your support.
[21:11.120 --> 21:12.440]  We need it now more than ever.
[21:12.440 --> 21:19.520]  We have a raft of specials available at infowarsstore.com right now, including bodies, which is the
[21:19.520 --> 21:20.520]  product that I take.

[21:25.120 --> 21:27.560]  studied ingredients known today.
[21:27.560 --> 21:32.840]  Again, this gives you great joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation

[21:48.120 --> 21:49.120]  reviewed studies.
[21:49.120 --> 21:53.680]  We're not claiming that this is part of the product, but if you look up turmeric, pretty

[24:31.360 --> 24:36.920]  infowars.com, Young Turks co-host, conveniently timed terrorist attack, that's a quote, could
[24:36.920 --> 24:43.000]  help Trump in midterms, oh who's the conspiracy theorist now, a co-host for the Young Turks
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.480]  thinks that a quote, conveniently timed war or terrorist attack could help Donald Trump
[24:47.480 --> 24:50.160]  turn out Republican voters for the midterms.
[24:50.160 --> 24:56.880]  In an article for CNBC, big mainstream website, CNBC, John I. Adderola, a left-wing political
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.840]  pundit, warns that the blue wave that is expected to see Democrats regain the house may not
[25:01.840 --> 25:07.880]  transpire if Trump can rally his base, what's one of the methods by which this Young Turks
[25:07.880 --> 25:12.760]  co-host thinks he can do that, well he thinks it could be a terrorist attack, it could be
[25:12.760 --> 25:13.760]  a war.
[25:13.760 --> 25:20.000]  Now the suggestion here is quite conspiratorial, let's just put it that way, this is the quote.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.840]  The base that today might be weary of Trump could rally to his defense if they believe
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.600]  they face some true threat in the form of a conveniently timed war, terrorist attack
[25:29.600 --> 25:34.280]  or existential threat to Donald Trump's presidency itself.
[25:34.280 --> 25:40.520]  So he's clearly suggesting that Trump would welcome a terrorist attack to boost Republicans
[25:40.520 --> 25:43.840]  hopes in the midterm elections.
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.360]  Basically this whole article is a big whinge fest about how Republicans have got an unfair
[25:47.360 --> 25:52.640]  advantage, he talks about a defamation campaign against special counsel Robert Moller which
[25:52.640 --> 25:57.120]  is basically just people pointing out that it's completely desperate at this point, they've
[25:57.120 --> 26:02.200]  got no evidence of collusion, that's not a defamation campaign, that's telling the truth.
[26:02.200 --> 26:07.120]  He talks about racist defunding of polling places in lower socioeconomic areas, basically
[26:07.120 --> 26:11.840]  his paranoid that the Democrats could throw this away, he's talking about they need to
[26:11.840 --> 26:16.680]  get more progressive candidates on board and not focus on the establishment, not rely on
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.120]  the establishment candidates, but he's saying that a conveniently timed war or terrorist
[26:21.120 --> 26:28.560]  attack could, Trump could take advantage of that like George W. Bush did back in 2002.
[26:28.560 --> 26:33.440]  Now this Hawkins back to a Washington Post report which came out in January, which prompted
[26:33.440 --> 26:39.760]  this slew of alarmist op-eds and articles from left-wing publications where they quoted
[26:39.760 --> 26:45.600]  Trump as saying, and again this is probably a leak, the accuracy of it we don't know,
[26:45.600 --> 26:49.880]  the Washington Post said that Trump said he doesn't think the 2018 election has to be
[26:49.880 --> 26:57.480]  as bad as others are predicting because he flashed back to 2002, the Republicans having
[26:57.480 --> 27:04.640]  their success in the midterms then as a result of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.
[27:04.640 --> 27:08.920]  So of course he made reference to it, he's not directly invoking it, he's certainly
[27:08.920 --> 27:12.680]  not saying, oh my God, we really need a terrorist attack.
[27:12.680 --> 27:17.200]  Even from the Washington Post quote, even if it's true, Trump basically just said, well
[27:17.200 --> 27:21.680]  that helped the Republicans, but it prompted a rash of alarmist responses from left-wing
[27:21.680 --> 27:27.680]  media outlets like Alternate and Box, which basically implied, if they didn't outright
[27:27.680 --> 27:32.000]  say it, that Trump was hoping for a terror attack to improve his fortune.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  So it's just interesting how if certain other news outlets came out with that kind of story,
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.440]  we would be bashed from pillar to post as extremist fringe conspiracy theorists, the
[27:42.440 --> 27:48.640]  Young Turks co-host can come out and say it, it's in an article on CNBC.com, buried in
[27:48.640 --> 27:54.920]  this article and nobody really cares, absolutely incredible.
[27:54.920 --> 27:59.320]  Another headline up on inforwars.com, exacerbated, frustrated Trump agrees to keep troops in
[27:59.320 --> 28:01.720]  Syria after pressure from Pentagon.
[28:01.720 --> 28:06.040]  Of course he came out with the announcement a couple of days ago that the US was going
[28:06.040 --> 28:11.360]  to pull troops out of Syria, didn't commit to a timetable, which of course set off the
[28:11.360 --> 28:15.920]  alarm bells for a lot of people in Trump's base, and now Pentagon officials reportedly
[28:15.920 --> 28:20.640]  pressured him into keeping our troops in place with no timetable for a withdrawal.
[28:20.640 --> 28:26.640]  Now because everyone supports Trump helping the Syrian government, if indirectly, to crush
[28:26.640 --> 28:31.000]  ISIS, they're saying that we need to make sure that ISIS has been crushed before we
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.640]  set a timetable for withdrawal.
[28:32.640 --> 28:36.760]  But again, the elements of the deep state still don't want that.
[28:36.760 --> 28:42.360]  They want to topple Bashar al-Assad because they want to outflank the Russians in Syria.
[28:42.360 --> 28:44.420]  So this isn't about a timetable.
[28:44.420 --> 28:49.400]  This is about them attempting to remain in the country and fulfill the same geopolitical
[28:49.400 --> 28:53.920]  agenda that Obama and Hillary Clinton pushed for, which is the overthrow of Assad.
[28:53.920 --> 28:55.400]  We'll get into it more after the break.
[28:55.400 --> 28:58.720]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live, Infowars.com.
[28:58.720 --> 28:59.720]  We'll be back.

[30:05.180 --> 30:06.180]  life.

[30:10.540 --> 30:12.300]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[30:12.300 --> 30:15.540]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[30:15.540 --> 30:16.620]  It's back in stock.
[30:16.620 --> 30:19.820]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[30:19.820 --> 30:23.300]  It's got the preglonone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[30:23.300 --> 30:27.620]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids, so you can upload it.

[30:51.420 --> 30:54.900]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread
[30:54.900 --> 30:55.900]  the word.
[30:55.900 --> 30:58.820]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[30:58.820 --> 31:02.020]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[31:02.020 --> 31:03.020]  Go ahead.
[31:03.020 --> 31:05.340]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[31:05.340 --> 31:08.980]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[31:08.980 --> 31:16.020]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[31:16.020 --> 31:22.140]  As a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex.
[31:22.140 --> 31:24.540]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[31:24.540 --> 31:25.540]  Thank you.
[31:25.540 --> 31:29.540]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[31:29.540 --> 31:30.540]  toothpaste fans.
[31:30.540 --> 31:35.300]  The super blue is awesome, and thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars life products.
[31:35.300 --> 31:36.500]  They are quality.
[31:36.500 --> 31:41.140]  I can't wait to get some more, and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[31:41.140 --> 31:42.140]  Absolutely.
[31:42.140 --> 31:47.500]  Yes, because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[31:47.500 --> 31:52.380]  understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order
[31:52.380 --> 31:59.980]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[31:59.980 --> 32:03.140]  Get ready for Alex Jones to invade the swamp.
[32:03.140 --> 32:08.460]  Jones is set to give a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on April 10,
[32:08.460 --> 32:12.900]  during which he'll make a statement on the raft of anti-free speech lawsuits targeting
[32:12.900 --> 32:14.860]  his First Amendment rights.
[32:14.860 --> 32:18.620]  Numerous lawsuits have been launched on the premise of attracting media attention and
[32:18.620 --> 32:22.140]  defaming Alex Jones and InfoWars' reputation.
[32:22.140 --> 32:27.020]  Jones will address the left's new tactic of trying to bury InfoWars under a deluge of
[32:27.020 --> 32:31.900]  lawsuits, several of which do not rest on any sound legal basis.
[32:31.900 --> 32:36.220]  While the mainstream media and many on the left routinely celebrate these lawsuits when
[32:36.220 --> 32:41.540]  they're first filed, those same people are noticeably silent when the lawsuits collapse.
[32:41.540 --> 32:45.860]  These lawsuits are yet another attempt to shut down free speech, and they are doomed
[32:45.860 --> 32:46.860]  to fail.
[32:46.860 --> 32:51.940]  Alex Jones will go live at 9 a.m. Eastern from the National Press Club in Washington,
[32:51.940 --> 32:57.060]  D.C. You can find live streams of the press conference at InfoWars.com.
[32:57.060 --> 33:21.980]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex
[33:21.980 --> 33:23.980]  Jones show.
[33:23.980 --> 33:27.700]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[33:27.700 --> 33:32.420]  Well, back it is, the Alex Jones show.
[33:32.420 --> 33:37.100]  We're going to get into the spate, the surge of violent crime on the streets of London
[33:37.100 --> 33:43.900]  with 16 ages last night being stabbed within 90 minutes of each other, within an hour and
[33:43.900 --> 33:46.340]  a half, 16 ages stabbed.
[33:46.340 --> 33:48.300]  It's completely out of control.
[33:48.300 --> 33:49.300]  It's only getting worse.
[33:49.300 --> 33:51.220]  Oh, but they put out a tweet.
[33:51.220 --> 33:54.940]  Like Sadiq Kahn put out a tweet today, so I guess it's problem solved.
[33:54.940 --> 33:55.940]  We're going to get into that.
[33:55.940 --> 34:00.140]  We're going to get into how they're having to do an investigation as to how many potential
[34:00.140 --> 34:04.060]  terrorists are working in the London transport system.
[34:04.060 --> 34:09.180]  Meanwhile, of course, people like Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern, you know, mild-mannered
[34:09.180 --> 34:12.020]  conservative YouTubers are being banned from the country.
[34:12.020 --> 34:15.420]  Oh, but we've got terrorists literally working in our transport system.
[34:15.420 --> 34:16.420]  No biggie.
[34:16.420 --> 34:20.140]  Well, then in returning ISIS jihadists from Syria, no biggie.
[34:20.140 --> 34:22.300]  Let's ban people for their political opinions.
[34:22.300 --> 34:27.100]  Let's ban people for handing out edgy leaflets on the streets of Luton, which is what happened,
[34:27.100 --> 34:28.100]  of course.
[34:28.100 --> 34:31.940]  Absolute joke situation in the United Kingdom right now.
[34:31.940 --> 34:33.260]  We're going to get into that.
[34:33.260 --> 34:39.820]  But first of all, Breitbart had a town hall last night called Masters of the Universe
[34:39.820 --> 34:43.980]  in which they talked about how we can combat, how we can fight back against social media
[34:43.980 --> 34:51.020]  censorship against big tech monopolies because, of course, there was another banning yesterday
[34:51.020 --> 34:56.500]  on Twitter, Owen Benjamin, a comedian who wasn't even political from what I can understand
[34:56.500 --> 34:58.020]  about three or four months ago.
[34:58.020 --> 35:02.660]  He became political, started building up a presence on Twitter and on YouTube, banned,
[35:02.660 --> 35:03.660]  gone.
[35:03.660 --> 35:04.660]  Why?
[35:04.660 --> 35:10.340]  Because he made some edgy comment, some edgy jokes towards everyone's favorite gun salesman
[35:10.340 --> 35:14.100]  David Hogg, because he did that, he's gone, silenced.
[35:14.100 --> 35:17.940]  Another conservative banned for their political persuasion.
[35:17.940 --> 35:23.660]  This is a huge issue because they can literally change the votes of millions of people in
[35:23.660 --> 35:24.660]  elections.
[35:24.660 --> 35:25.900]  Google's proven that.
[35:25.900 --> 35:30.380]  And Epstein, Robert Epstein, I talked about this at the start of the show, he's a senior
[35:30.380 --> 35:34.740]  research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology.
[35:34.740 --> 35:40.500]  That was Breitbart, Epstein at Masters of the Universe Town Hall, Google favored search
[35:40.500 --> 35:43.460]  results for Clinton over Trump.
[35:43.460 --> 35:47.660]  Now we told you about this at the time, right before the election, they all called it conspiracy
[35:47.660 --> 35:48.660]  theory.
[35:48.660 --> 35:50.420]  It was completely true.
[35:50.420 --> 35:55.860]  Now this guy's done the studies which shows dependent on the first two search results
[35:55.860 --> 36:02.340]  on Google, you can switch the votes of millions of millions of people in any national election.
[36:02.340 --> 36:06.660]  So long as you get those top two search results and they're positive towards the candidate
[36:06.660 --> 36:12.180]  you want to push or negative towards the candidate you don't want to push, that can change the
[36:12.180 --> 36:13.900]  outcome of an election.
[36:13.900 --> 36:18.820]  So they talk about Russian bots, they talk about fake news and collusion that had no
[36:18.820 --> 36:20.940]  impact on the election.
[36:20.940 --> 36:21.940]  This did.
[36:21.940 --> 36:25.940]  I mean, Hillary won by three million votes, obviously in the popular vote.
[36:25.940 --> 36:29.900]  If they had not have gamed it for us, you probably would have lost those, that three million
[36:29.900 --> 36:30.900]  lead.
[36:30.900 --> 36:35.060]  They've done studies where in India in all these other elections it changed a huge number
[36:35.060 --> 36:36.260]  of votes.
[36:36.260 --> 36:41.500]  This is the power of the algorithm and you can bet your bottom dollar are going to turn
[36:41.500 --> 36:45.700]  it up to 11 coming up in these 2018 midterms.
[36:45.700 --> 36:47.900]  So this is Robert Epstein.
[36:47.900 --> 36:51.740]  He said that Google favored positive search results of Hillary Clinton above those of
[36:51.740 --> 36:52.740]  President Trump.
[36:52.740 --> 36:55.500]  We'll explain exactly how in a second.
[36:55.500 --> 36:57.420]  He said there's two main things that we have found.
[36:57.420 --> 37:01.700]  We came up with a system, a monitoring system for monitoring search results on Google, Bing
[37:01.700 --> 37:06.380]  and Yahoo for six months before the presidential election in 2016.
[37:06.380 --> 37:11.260]  The story of our findings was broken by the Washington Post in early 2017 and here's what
[37:11.260 --> 37:12.260]  we found.
[37:12.260 --> 37:14.100]  This is Robert Epstein.
[37:14.100 --> 37:19.060]  We found that Google search results favored Hillary Clinton in all 10 positions of those
[37:19.060 --> 37:25.060]  search results on the first page for almost all of those six months leading up to the
[37:25.060 --> 37:26.060]  election.
[37:26.060 --> 37:30.740]  It wasn't the same situation on the other search pages, which of course are massively
[37:30.740 --> 37:35.340]  dwarfed by Google, where they had a mix of negative and positive search results.
[37:35.340 --> 37:41.220]  Google 10 positions on the first page leading up to the election all positive for Hillary
[37:41.220 --> 37:42.220]  Clinton.
[37:42.220 --> 37:47.100]  He went on to say, quote, now that's enough to shift two to three million votes at least,
[37:47.100 --> 37:51.740]  which is what Hillary won by in the popular vote, without anyone knowing that they have
[37:51.740 --> 37:53.540]  been manipulated.
[37:53.540 --> 37:54.860]  That is the power.
[37:54.860 --> 37:56.620]  And that's just one instance of it.
[37:56.620 --> 37:59.020]  I mean, I've talked about it before.
[37:59.020 --> 38:02.620]  I write articles every day, obviously, for infowars.com.
[38:02.620 --> 38:04.020]  I need to flash back.
[38:04.020 --> 38:08.020]  I need to refer back to previous articles that I've written about similar subjects.
[38:08.020 --> 38:11.980]  So if I'm writing an article about, I don't know, migration in Sweden, the problems that
[38:11.980 --> 38:18.500]  that's causing, I will refer back to a previous article that I wrote three, four weeks ago.
[38:18.500 --> 38:23.100]  So I put the headline into Google, put my name into Google, put infowars.com sometimes
[38:23.100 --> 38:28.220]  into Google, and almost every time, well, not every time, but occasionally, probably
[38:28.220 --> 38:34.740]  like 50% of the time, the top search is all is a salon.com hit piece about yours truly,
[38:34.740 --> 38:40.020]  or it's media matters, or it's one of these other Soros groups, or it's Snopes.com.
[38:40.020 --> 38:44.860]  Over the past year, and especially in intensified in the past six months, they have changed
[38:44.860 --> 38:49.780]  the algorithm where even if you directly search for a headline, and then Paul Joseph Watson
[38:49.780 --> 38:55.100]  infowars.com, sometimes they will put the hit piece, which is completely unrelated to
[38:55.100 --> 38:59.220]  the search headline, the headline that you searched, they will put the result for the
[38:59.220 --> 39:03.220]  hit piece above what you're actually searching for.
[39:03.220 --> 39:05.060]  That's not a search engine.
[39:05.060 --> 39:06.820]  That's brainwashing.
[39:06.820 --> 39:08.100]  That's indoctrination.
[39:08.100 --> 39:10.220]  That's political manipulation.
[39:10.220 --> 39:12.580]  That's exactly what Google is engaging in.
[39:12.580 --> 39:15.460]  They did it before the election, obviously, didn't do it enough.
[39:15.460 --> 39:20.340]  Now they've turned it up to 11, Facebook, the exact same thing.
[39:20.340 --> 39:23.580]  Numerous prominent people, and I've spoken to some of them, we're talking about the most
[39:23.580 --> 39:28.140]  prominent people on the conservative right, have said to me privately, and some have said
[39:28.140 --> 39:33.180]  publicly, Facebook's algorithm, not only since February, but definitely over the past three
[39:33.180 --> 39:36.060]  weeks, is completely crushing conservatives.
[39:36.060 --> 39:42.060]  Now, I remember the Western Journalism Study found that conservative websites were affected
[39:42.060 --> 39:48.020]  by this algorithm change way more than left-wing websites, which I think they went up 2%.
[39:48.020 --> 39:52.740]  Conservative websites went down, I think, 13% in traffic, even more if you take Fox News
[39:52.740 --> 39:55.340]  out of the equation because they went up.
[39:55.340 --> 40:00.140]  So they were being crushed back in February when they changed the algorithm, less traffic,
[40:00.140 --> 40:04.060]  less shares to conservative news sources from Facebook.
[40:04.060 --> 40:08.620]  The last few weeks, it's been absolutely dire.
[40:08.620 --> 40:12.820]  I'm talking about videos on Facebook where I will put a video on Facebook, one of my
[40:12.820 --> 40:20.180]  YouTube videos, put it on Facebook, it will get, in the past, 200,000, 300,000 views overnight.
[40:20.180 --> 40:24.860]  If it's a good one, eventually it'll get 2 million views on Facebook.
[40:24.860 --> 40:29.900]  Even a video that doesn't really go across that well will get at least two, three, 400,000
[40:29.900 --> 40:31.900]  views on Facebook.
[40:31.900 --> 40:36.140]  Now I put a video up last week, I think it was, it got 78,000 views.
[40:36.140 --> 40:43.100]  They've absolutely crushed us on the video views, absolutely crushed us, and many other
[40:43.100 --> 40:45.900]  people are reporting exactly the same thing.
[40:45.900 --> 40:49.620]  They're not getting the shares, they're not getting the video views on Facebook.
[40:49.620 --> 40:55.740]  Their content remains as popular as ever, but people aren't seeing it in their feeds.
[40:55.740 --> 41:00.100]  This is how they beat us with shadow banning with algorithm changes.
[41:00.100 --> 41:05.900]  So while Twitter just bans people, which is more honest in a way, Facebook, Google,
[41:05.900 --> 41:07.580]  everything is behind the scenes.
[41:07.580 --> 41:12.180]  If you can't really pinpoint what's happening, if you can't point to examples apart from
[41:12.180 --> 41:17.100]  just to say, well, my traffic's down, then what can you prove?
[41:17.100 --> 41:21.220]  But it's definitely happening because I'm hearing it from absolutely everyone.
[41:21.220 --> 41:23.820]  Google did it before the election, they're going to do it again.
[41:23.820 --> 41:30.220]  Robert Epstein, continuing at this Breitbart town hall last night, he gives the example.
[41:30.220 --> 41:34.420]  For example, we typed in on Bing and Yahoo, Hillary Clinton is, and we get Hillary Clinton
[41:34.420 --> 41:37.980]  is the devil, Hillary Clinton is sick, Hillary Clinton is dying of cancer.
[41:37.980 --> 41:42.380]  You saw this at the time, remember, we did a big piece on this, literally 8 or 10 extremely
[41:42.380 --> 41:48.060]  negative search results because that's what people were in fact searching for.
[41:48.060 --> 41:50.140]  So it was completely organic.
[41:50.140 --> 41:54.060]  People were searching for these things, they were appearing in the auto complete suggestions
[41:54.060 --> 41:58.180]  on Google search because that's what people wanted to look up.
[41:58.180 --> 42:01.780]  So then they did the same test, they went to Google and he says, I have screenshots
[42:01.780 --> 42:04.740]  of all this, we do too, we put out the article at the time.
[42:04.740 --> 42:08.940]  You type in Hillary Clinton, remember this is a few months before the election, Hillary
[42:08.940 --> 42:16.700]  Clinton is and we get Hillary Clinton is awesome, Hillary Clinton is winning and that's it.
[42:16.700 --> 42:21.100]  So it's every other search engine, it was organic, it was what people were searching
[42:21.100 --> 42:27.300]  for, but then you tried the same thing on Google.com, you only got positive suggestions
[42:27.300 --> 42:29.060]  for Hillary Clinton.
[42:29.060 --> 42:34.500]  That is political manipulation, that is in fact a violation of the Decency Communications
[42:34.500 --> 42:39.540]  Act section 230 where these big social media and search websites have to remain politically
[42:39.540 --> 42:44.700]  neutral and non-partisan, they're not, they're gaming the system because we're winning the
[42:44.700 --> 42:49.460]  argument so they have to cheat because they can't beat us on a level playing field.
[42:49.460 --> 42:53.620]  This is a massive issue, it's only going to get bigger as we head up to the November
[42:53.620 --> 42:59.460]  2018 mid-times, we'll be back on the Alex Jones Show Live, infowars.com, don't go away.
[42:59.460 --> 43:02.860]  Introducing Cell Force by Infowars Life.
[43:02.860 --> 43:07.380]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[43:07.380 --> 43:12.740]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy, they are your body's cellular engines.
[43:12.740 --> 43:17.460]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[43:17.460 --> 43:23.500]  like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency,
[43:23.500 --> 43:26.860]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[43:26.860 --> 43:32.020]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[43:32.020 --> 43:34.940]  these reactive oxygen species.
[43:34.940 --> 43:39.980]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[43:39.980 --> 43:44.780]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[43:44.780 --> 43:47.540]  species and other free radicals.
[43:47.540 --> 43:52.620]  Boost, protect and adapt with Cell Force from Infowars Life.

[43:58.980 --> 44:03.620]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest
[44:03.620 --> 44:10.380]  cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[44:10.380 --> 44:16.340]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat
[44:16.340 --> 44:22.860]  and other proteins better, and then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic
[44:22.860 --> 44:28.260]  culture of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration.
[44:28.260 --> 44:33.820]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance, but all of
[44:33.820 --> 44:42.180]  these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely
[44:42.180 --> 44:43.700]  affordable price.
[44:43.700 --> 44:49.460]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[44:49.460 --> 44:54.500]  When you purchase it at infowarsstore.com, you know you are also financing the attack
[44:54.500 --> 45:00.020]  on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[45:00.020 --> 45:04.420]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[45:04.420 --> 45:09.100]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[45:09.100 --> 45:10.620]  to detoxify the body.
[45:10.620 --> 45:12.980]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[45:12.980 --> 45:15.460]  Big metal and chemical defense support.
[45:15.460 --> 45:17.020]  It's made in the USA.
[45:17.020 --> 45:21.940]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[45:21.940 --> 45:23.780]  the body and it supports the info war.
[45:23.780 --> 45:26.020]  It is a classical 360 win.
[45:26.020 --> 45:30.500]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[45:30.500 --> 45:35.180]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[45:35.180 --> 45:36.180]  get.
[45:36.180 --> 45:39.420]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[45:39.420 --> 45:44.460]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[45:44.460 --> 45:49.700]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[45:49.700 --> 45:52.420]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[45:52.420 --> 45:55.740]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[45:55.740 --> 46:00.140]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at infowarslife.com.
[46:00.140 --> 46:05.540]  Infowars Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and
[46:05.540 --> 46:06.540]  for a good reason.
[46:06.540 --> 46:10.580]  About five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were, what were most
[46:10.580 --> 46:14.860]  popular, what were best, what people liked, and we made it even stronger.
[46:14.860 --> 46:19.900]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[46:19.900 --> 46:23.700]  We only have 150%, and then it helps funder operation.
[46:23.700 --> 46:26.500]  Well now it's 50% off.
[46:26.500 --> 46:33.380]  That means we've got a 25% markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes
[46:33.380 --> 46:36.700]  about seven days to kick in, Brain Force takes about 30 minutes.
[46:36.700 --> 46:40.260]  But the two go together, it's the mind and body challenge.
[46:40.260 --> 46:47.340]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the
[46:47.340 --> 46:49.740]  combo at infowarslife.com.
[46:49.740 --> 46:54.140]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell
[46:54.140 --> 46:55.140]  out.
[46:55.140 --> 47:06.260]  That's why we're here at infowarslife.com to get your Brain Force Plus and real red
[47:06.260 --> 47:26.460]  pill for the next few months.
[47:26.460 --> 47:36.220]  Now there's something going on with Twitter, it's talking about Big Tech.
[47:36.220 --> 47:44.660]  Twitter has been completely broke, I've been sending out tweets which basically get a handful
[47:44.660 --> 47:45.660]  of retweets.
[47:45.660 --> 47:47.900]  I can do a tweet normally about a good issue.
[47:47.900 --> 47:53.900]  It will get hundreds of retweets within about half an hour, dozens of retweets within minutes.
[47:53.900 --> 47:59.900]  Over the past two hours, these tweets that I'm sending out are getting no traction whatsoever.
[47:59.900 --> 48:03.220]  It's happening to other people as well, I've confirmed that.
[48:03.220 --> 48:07.660]  The timelines are all broken, people aren't seeing the tweets but from the people who
[48:07.660 --> 48:08.660]  they follow.
[48:08.660 --> 48:13.100]  Now obviously there's some kind of bug here but there's also speculation that this could
[48:13.100 --> 48:18.340]  be Twitter instituting or testing a shadow banning system.
[48:18.340 --> 48:23.020]  Now we know people have complained about that in the past where suddenly they have voracious
[48:23.020 --> 48:27.580]  retweets, they get 500, 1,000, 2,000 retweets per tweet on average.
[48:27.580 --> 48:28.580]  Suddenly it drops off.
[48:28.580 --> 48:32.700]  They don't know why, it's because they've been shadow banned because their tweets aren't
[48:32.700 --> 48:34.300]  showing up in people's timelines.
[48:34.300 --> 48:38.500]  Well that's been happening for the past two hours at least on Twitter.
[48:38.500 --> 48:42.380]  Everybody's complaining about it so it is a bug but there's also speculation it could
[48:42.380 --> 48:48.420]  be a test for them to institute shadow banning on certain accounts.
[48:48.420 --> 48:50.500]  So we're going to keep an eye on that.
[48:50.500 --> 48:54.740]  Obviously we've been censored, we've been lobbied to be censored by CNN.
[48:54.740 --> 48:59.100]  They were in direct communication with YouTube about a month ago trying to get our channel
[48:59.100 --> 49:00.420]  shut down.
[49:00.420 --> 49:04.060]  We have frivolous lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit which is why we need your support.
[49:04.060 --> 49:09.300]  We've got a new 34 hour broadcast special coming up next week which is going to start
[49:09.300 --> 49:12.500]  at 8am on Thursday and go to 6pm on Friday.
[49:12.500 --> 49:17.140]  It's going to be absolutely massive, ton of guests, new people hosting, it's going to
[49:17.140 --> 49:18.140]  be very exciting.
[49:18.140 --> 49:22.380]  So mark that in your diary, a new 34 hour special broadcast.
[49:22.380 --> 49:27.580]  Of course Alex Jones is also going to give his speech at the press club on Tuesday, April
[49:27.580 --> 49:28.580]  10th.
[49:28.580 --> 49:32.860]  I've streamed as well so we're sure to mark your diary for that.
[49:32.860 --> 49:37.500]  And please continue to support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[49:37.500 --> 49:40.620]  We have alpha power back in stock.
[49:40.620 --> 49:45.620]  The fan favourite is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[49:45.620 --> 49:49.580]  It may be one of our newest products but it's one of the fastest selling products we've
[49:49.580 --> 49:50.580]  ever had.
[49:50.580 --> 49:54.700]  And you can tell why by reading all those five star reviews and that's why we're dropping
[49:54.700 --> 49:59.340]  it by 25% to help you experience it before it goes back out of stock.
[49:59.340 --> 50:04.620]  As you age, as we all do, your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every
[50:04.620 --> 50:05.620]  single year.
[50:05.620 --> 50:07.860]  You don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[50:07.860 --> 50:11.780]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[50:11.780 --> 50:18.340]  And again, you look at the studies, testosterone in the west is dropping off rapidly due to
[50:18.340 --> 50:21.540]  a number of different factors including diet.
[50:21.540 --> 50:25.860]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you help you beat the test of time
[50:25.860 --> 50:29.820]  and assist in restoring that reduced energy and change your mood that often comes with
[50:29.820 --> 50:31.260]  time and age.

[51:08.100 --> 51:12.420]  Now last night in London, 16 ages were stabbed within 90 minutes of each other.
[51:12.420 --> 51:16.860]  London is now more violent since February than New York City.
[51:16.860 --> 51:18.060]  Let that sink in.
[51:18.060 --> 51:22.540]  Same population, way more violent, you're talking three times more burglaries.
[51:22.540 --> 51:28.300]  Look at these stats on the city corn, our Mayor of London, our Islamist Mayor of London.
[51:28.300 --> 51:34.220]  12% crime increase since he took office, epidemic levels of acid attacks.
[51:34.220 --> 51:38.620]  February and March have outpaced New York City in homicides for the first time in modern
[51:38.620 --> 51:39.620]  history.
[51:39.620 --> 51:45.500]  16 stabbed across the city in 90 minutes last night, stabbing every single day.
[51:45.500 --> 51:46.660]  What is going on?
[51:46.660 --> 51:51.980]  Well, we know what Sadiq Khan has going on, he's complaining about mean tweets.
[51:51.980 --> 51:56.700]  He was literally in Austin, what was it about a month ago, complaining about mean tweets
[51:56.700 --> 52:01.180]  while young people across the capital are getting acid attacks, are getting stabbed.
[52:01.180 --> 52:05.540]  Yes, some of it is gang related, which is why a lot of people don't seem to care about
[52:05.540 --> 52:06.540]  it.
[52:06.540 --> 52:12.300]  We have all these remoners, all these liberal progressives here in the metropolitan elitist
[52:12.300 --> 52:17.820]  bubble of London who claim to be anti-racist, probably about 50% at least, are these kids
[52:17.820 --> 52:21.500]  getting stabbed or black kids, they don't really care about it, they don't care about
[52:21.500 --> 52:22.500]  it.
[52:22.500 --> 52:23.500]  There's no outrage about it.
[52:23.500 --> 52:27.060]  There's more outrage about Islamophobic tweets after terror attacks.
[52:27.060 --> 52:29.820]  They don't care about black kids getting stabbed.
[52:29.820 --> 52:35.620]  Now Nigel Farage has come out and we have the clip right now saying that political correctness
[52:35.620 --> 52:40.060]  can be blamed for some of this violent crime, here's the clip.
[52:40.060 --> 52:45.860]  Well, I think we've got a breakdown of law and order in certain districts in London and
[52:45.860 --> 52:52.140]  remarkably, this Mayor of London has not visited a single one of the crime scenes.
[52:52.140 --> 52:58.340]  He has not met any of the bereaved families and he's simply burying his head in the sand.
[52:58.340 --> 53:03.020]  Everyone's scared of the police and the authorities being called racist, so we've taken our foot
[53:03.020 --> 53:08.180]  off the pedal and I would say that political correctness has directly led to the murder
[53:08.180 --> 53:10.820]  rate going up in London.
[53:10.820 --> 53:14.420]  That is Nigel Farage identifying political correctness.
[53:14.420 --> 53:15.420]  What does he mean by that?
[53:15.420 --> 53:21.500]  Well, we had stop and search which was reduced drastically over the past few years as those
[53:21.500 --> 53:27.500]  stop and searchers fell because they didn't want to profile mainly black gang members,
[53:27.500 --> 53:30.860]  they didn't want to stop and search them because, God forbid, they might be called
[53:30.860 --> 53:31.860]  racist.
[53:31.860 --> 53:36.420]  What's happened as a result of that is these gang members are more emboldened to carry
[53:36.420 --> 53:39.620]  weapons, to carry acid, to carry knives.
[53:39.620 --> 53:43.900]  So that's one of the reasons why the attacks are increasing because the police are afraid
[53:43.900 --> 53:50.040]  of being called racist, but if you make an edgy tweet or a mean Facebook post, they'll
[53:50.040 --> 53:55.180]  be knocking on your door, literally knocking on your door, 3,000 people in the UK arrested
[53:55.180 --> 53:57.900]  every year because of tweets.
[53:57.900 --> 54:04.060]  They have 900 plus, this is a tweet by the Metropolitan Police, they've got 900 plus
[54:04.060 --> 54:11.140]  specialist officers, specialists across London, one city dedicated to investigating hate crime.
[54:11.140 --> 54:12.820]  And what is hate crime?
[54:12.820 --> 54:13.820]  It's mean comments.
[54:13.820 --> 54:17.900]  In fact, we had an article in Infowars not long ago where they literally sent police
[54:17.900 --> 54:23.620]  to a school playground because one of the children had called some, one of the other
[54:23.620 --> 54:28.300]  kids a homophobic slur, call the cops.
[54:28.300 --> 54:33.260]  Meanwhile, people are being stabbed, 16 ages stabbed in 90 minutes, not dealing with that,
[54:33.260 --> 54:35.780]  dealing with playground insults.
[54:35.780 --> 54:40.540]  This is Sadiq Khan, this is his policy in 2016.
[54:40.540 --> 54:45.180]  Khan announced millions in taxpayer cash would to be spent on an online hate crime hub to
[54:45.180 --> 54:49.900]  police speech online and criminalize people offending others on social media.
[54:49.900 --> 54:53.180]  God forbid, anybody might have their fee fees hurt.
[54:53.180 --> 54:57.340]  So they spent all the money, they're whining about budget cuts, they're whining about no
[54:57.340 --> 55:02.700]  money for police, they're whining about lack of resources, they spent millions on policing
[55:02.700 --> 55:04.540]  mean tweets.
[55:04.540 --> 55:11.020]  Meanwhile, reducing stop and search, the very process that, you know, makes these criminals
[55:11.020 --> 55:14.540]  less inclined to carry weapons and stab people.
[55:14.540 --> 55:18.260]  All the resources are going towards patrolling speech.
[55:18.260 --> 55:22.820]  In 2017, London police announced they no longer had the resources to investigate many low
[55:22.820 --> 55:23.820]  level crimes.
[55:23.820 --> 55:28.180]  If there's an actual crime going on, forget about it, but this online hate crime hub,
[55:28.180 --> 55:32.500]  this is what's important, including some assaults and forms of fraud.
[55:32.500 --> 55:36.780]  We had a story last week where a guy he was being burgled, his home was being invaded
[55:36.780 --> 55:41.660]  by two robbers, he stabbed one of them with a screwdriver, trying to get them away from
[55:41.660 --> 55:43.340]  him, trying to get them off him.
[55:43.340 --> 55:44.580]  He was arrested.
[55:44.580 --> 55:48.020]  The guy who defended himself was arrested.
[55:48.020 --> 55:51.540]  The police aren't going to turn up because somebody said something mean on Twitter about
[55:51.540 --> 55:54.740]  Islam, that's what they're focused on.
[55:54.740 --> 55:56.740]  Absolute joke.
[55:56.740 --> 56:00.660]  Despite the massive focus on offensive speech and hate crimes, prosecutions for which have
[56:00.660 --> 56:05.080]  actually fallen despite a large increase in reporting, indicating that many allegations
[56:05.080 --> 56:06.940]  are flimsy or even fictional.
[56:06.940 --> 56:08.460]  So again, it's like the whole Brexit myth.
[56:08.460 --> 56:12.980]  There was this myth after Brexit, oh, surging hate crimes, no.
[56:12.980 --> 56:18.100]  The actual prosecuted ones went down because it was people riled up by this hysteria put
[56:18.100 --> 56:19.620]  out by the media.
[56:19.620 --> 56:22.780]  When they were actually investigated, it turned out to be nothing whatsoever.
[56:22.780 --> 56:28.620]  It goes on to say, a hate incident only needs to be perceived by the victim or someone else
[56:28.620 --> 56:31.060]  to be logged by police with no evidence needed.
[56:31.060 --> 56:36.620]  They actually had a police description of a hate crime on the website or a hate incident
[56:36.620 --> 56:41.860]  where they said, you don't have to be committing a crime to commit a hate crime or a hate incident.
[56:41.860 --> 56:46.860]  If the victim perceives it to be offensive, then it's a crime.
[56:46.860 --> 56:47.860]  Absolutely Orwellian.
[56:47.860 --> 56:53.180]  Meanwhile, people are being stabbed every 90 minutes in that six teenagers stabbed in
[56:53.180 --> 56:54.180]  90 minutes.
[56:54.180 --> 56:56.460]  While I've been on air, there's probably been another three.
[56:56.460 --> 56:58.980]  It's just an epidemic at this point.
[56:58.980 --> 57:02.220]  An ex-metropolis and police chief are going to get into this after the breakers come out
[57:02.220 --> 57:07.540]  and said, London police have lost control of the streets.
[57:07.540 --> 57:08.540]  And why?
[57:08.540 --> 57:13.780]  Because they're superiors are telling them 900 plus of them to investigate mean comments
[57:13.780 --> 57:14.780]  on the internet.
[57:14.780 --> 57:19.860]  Meanwhile, we're banning conservative YouTubers like Lauren Southern and Brittany Pettibone
[57:19.860 --> 57:24.580]  as actual potential terrorists work in the London Transport Network.
[57:24.580 --> 57:29.980]  There's now a huge concern about potential terrorists working on London's transport
[57:29.980 --> 57:30.980]  system.
[57:30.980 --> 57:34.540]  As one of them did, the guy who carried out the London Bridgetite was actually working
[57:34.540 --> 57:36.700]  within the transport system.
[57:36.700 --> 57:38.260]  That's not being focused on.
[57:38.260 --> 57:43.900]  What's being focused on is conservative YouTubers mean tweets and playground insults.
[57:43.900 --> 57:45.300]  The UK is a joke.
[57:45.300 --> 57:47.780]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones show live.
[57:47.780 --> 57:49.380]  Don't go away.
[57:49.380 --> 57:52.180]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[57:52.180 --> 57:58.540]  It's micro ZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up signed to your contract
[57:58.540 --> 58:03.420]  with even bigger organic manufacturer and producer scalability.
[58:03.420 --> 58:10.060]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39 50% off because there's a lot
[58:10.060 --> 58:12.460]  of product and a lot of ingredient micro ZX.
[58:12.460 --> 58:14.020]  Now, it's the other side of the equation.
[58:14.020 --> 58:18.020]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins
[58:18.020 --> 58:21.900]  in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the
[58:21.900 --> 58:27.100]  probiotics help us place yeast mold, create slime walls.
[58:27.100 --> 58:31.660]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes
[58:31.660 --> 58:32.660]  all sorts of syrups issues.
[58:32.660 --> 58:37.380]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy
[58:37.380 --> 58:39.340]  that slime wall.
[58:39.340 --> 58:41.540]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[58:41.540 --> 58:50.020]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved micro ZX plus now from the info wars store.
[58:50.020 --> 58:56.340]  I want to plow into all of this that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[58:56.340 --> 59:02.740]  listeners to understand that when you buy t shirts or water filtration systems or books
[59:02.740 --> 59:09.980]  or videos or other material from info wars store.com, you are funding the revolution.
[59:09.980 --> 59:14.900]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[59:14.900 --> 59:15.900]  at info wars store.com.
[59:15.900 --> 59:19.580]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste
[59:19.580 --> 59:24.740]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that for
[59:24.740 --> 59:25.740]  children and adults.
[59:25.740 --> 59:28.500]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[59:28.500 --> 59:33.900]  That's my dad, the colloidal silver and iodine as well info wars life.com or triple A two
[59:33.900 --> 59:38.500]  five three three one three nine and your purchase of the products stands with us stands with
[59:38.500 --> 59:42.820]  America stands with Trump stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies
[59:42.820 --> 59:46.460]  and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against
[59:46.460 --> 59:53.620]  us so we need your support.
[59:53.620 --> 01:00:13.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:26.340]  Jones, my name is Jake Lloyd, your host for the second and third hours.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:30.620]  It's not Alex Jones actually it's Jake Lloyd, but I'm happy to be hosting the Alex Jones
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.620]  show today filling in a little bit.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:36.540]  It's April 6th tax season is almost over.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:41.220]  Speaking of tax season, I wanted to take a second to read this article, 20% of Americans
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:47.700]  will pay 87% of the income tax and I just thought that was I thought it was really interesting.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.700]  Is it right?
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:53.980]  Is it just that 20% of Americans should be paying the 80% of the income tax and I'm not
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.460]  I'm not somebody who believes in total equality.
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.820]  I don't believe in that.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:04.760]  But progressive income taxes I think are distinctly immoral so I wanted to take just a second
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:12.940]  to think about that up until when when early 1900s early 1900s around FDRs time we had
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:18.980]  nothing but sales tax, maybe some property tax here and there depending on where you
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.300]  lived in the States but there was no income tax.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.220]  Constitution doesn't afford for that but that's just an interesting thought.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:30.420]  I just think that it's interesting that 20% of Americans are paying over 87% of the income
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:35.740]  tax and maybe that could be done with if we get rid of some of the socialism, the entitlements,
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:39.900]  the welfare, all those different things especially since we have all these people coming in all
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.300]  these illegal immigrants coming in unfettered.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.420]  So be sure to do your taxes.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.900]  Maybe you can get a little bit of your tax money back since the government takes more
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:53.980]  than they're owed just so that they can give some of it back to you if they feel like it.
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:56.020]  So that's interesting.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:01.420]  Be sure to be paying attention on April 10th, Alex Jones will be going to D.C. to do a press
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.420]  conference.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:08.780]  He will be doing it at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. 9 a.m. on April 10th
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:16.800]  is doing it to discuss the attacks Roger Stone has called it lawfare but they're essentially
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.860]  trying to drive Alex Jones infowars other independent media sources.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:28.460]  Anybody that threatens their hegemony in the media sphere, they're attempting to drive
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:31.700]  us out of business by way of legal fees.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:32.900]  They mount up these legal fees.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:38.780]  It doesn't matter that they won't win but we have to pay to defend ourselves because
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:42.220]  we can't allow them to do this with impunity.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:49.820]  So they mount these frivolous lawsuits against us, numerous, numerous multitudes of lawsuits
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:55.040]  to try and drive us out of business and so Alex Jones will be going to the National Press
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:02.540]  Club in Washington D.C. in order to do a Q&A to talk about what we're doing so we can answer
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:03.540]  your questions.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.020]  They'll also be addressing our tactics to fight against them.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.620]  There are laws in Texas, for example, and in other states that prevent, they're called
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:17.220]  anti-slap laws which is just a law that prevents people from doing these frivolous lawsuits
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:22.020]  so hopefully we can have those addressed but April 10th, Alex Jones will be traveling
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.020]  to the swamp.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:27.420]  We're going to have live coverage at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:34.300]  It's in the Zanger Room, 52914 St. or excuse me, Street, Northwest Washington D.C.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:39.540]  Be sure to email any media inquiries to press at infowars.com.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.420]  You do have to RSVP.
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.580]  You can also text the number.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.420]  It doesn't look like the number's up here right now but there's a number you can text
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:51.220]  but RSVP at press at infowars.com and that brings us to another issue.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.460]  We're going to be playing for the rest of this hour.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:54.900]  I'll be bringing it in and out.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:59.780]  We're going to be playing the interview that Infowars, Alex Jones in particular, conducted
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:02.740]  with Ted Nugent a couple weeks ago.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.740]  It's an excellent interview.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.980]  I've seen some of it here and there.
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:10.740]  Ted Nugent is really just a brilliant patriotic American who's doing what he can to fight
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.460]  back against the globalist attack on America.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:18.900]  So please tune into that and caveat to that.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:24.020]  If you want to see content like this continue and if you want to see us survive against
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:30.180]  these frivolous lawsuits, the multitude, please go to InfowarsStore.com to support us.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.700]  We need your support.

[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.820]  We also need it to hire new people.
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:39.620]  We need it to continue producing excellent content like the Ted Nugent interview.

[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.100]  We need your help more than ever.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.100]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.780]  We will be right back with the Ted Nugent interview.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.300]  Absolutely hard hitting stuff.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.460]  Firestorm with Ted Nugent.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.460]  My name is Jay Floyd.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.460]  Thank you very much.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.460]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:56.460]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:02.820]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:03.820]  in Fuller's life.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.060]  They take hours.
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.540]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.540]  It's stronger.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:13.540]  It's the other equation in probiotics and knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.660]  It's back in stock.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:17.860]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.060]  It's got the preglonone.
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.260]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:25.620]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids, so you can upload it.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:30.180]  And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:34.820]  fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:35.820]  That's a spray you do.
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.060]  You can also swallow it.
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:42.540]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.740]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:49.460]  So thank you all for remembering infomerstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:52.940]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:53.940]  the word.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:06:10.540]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:14.300]  Welcome to you from the former United States of America.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:26.540]  From deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:32.740]  Luckily, however, a beachhead, we have a beachhead with Donald Trump.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.860]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.540]  My name is Jake Lloyd, your host.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:39.580]  For the rest of this segment, this hour, we're going to be going to the Ted Nugent interview
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.460]  we conducted a few weeks back.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.460]  Firestorm with Ted Nugent.
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:07:09.940]  Here it is.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:24.980]  We're at Ted Nugent's amazing Texas ranch, and I feel like I'm following the white rabbit
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:25.980]  down the rabbit hole.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.980]  It's good to be in America.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:27.980]  It's good to be in Texas.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:28.980]  It's good to have a Second Amendment.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:29.980]  Even though these bastards are trying to steal our nambarth right, we're going to let them
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:30.980]  stand up and not stop us.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980]  Thanks to folks like Ted Nugent and all of you out there.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:32.980]  Thank you.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:42.980]  We have the right to keep and bear arms, not just the king, the people, we, the people
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:43.980]  have the right to keep and bear arms.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.980]  You try and take away from us, we'll shoot you.
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:45.980]  I'm kind of hesitant to even share this information, but once again, information is knowledge.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.980]  Knowledge is power.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.980]  Power is the capability of correcting law.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.980]  I'm usually dead on the boat.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:49.980]  I'm actually sweating.
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:50.980]  I'm sweating.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:51.980]  I'm sweating.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:52.980]  I'm sweating.
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.980]  I'm sweating.
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:54.980]  I'm sweating.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:08:04.980]  I'm sweating.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:16.220]  I'm sweating.
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:22.380]  hunting dogs in the world. I had machine guns and everything I want in life. The best sounding band,
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:27.660]  the best grinding rhythm and blues rock and roll band in the world. We have reached critical mass
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:32.860]  and I'm walking every greasy, glory rhythm and blues motown minute of it. Yeah! The people who
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:38.540]  make me their hands because I'm so happy. Onside Ted Nugent's awesome ranch with his great wife and
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:51.020]  family, this is America. This is the heart of 1776. So everybody want coffee? Sure, we love some.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:56.140]  All right, here's some good Nugent Java and I'm not kidding, this isn't Tom Petty coffee man.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:01.020]  My coffee is the only coffee that's holistically coefficient.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:05.020]  I like this good cup of joe man.
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:14.860]  New coffee brought to you by Stay On Point. Now take a slug on that Jones. Yes sir.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.540]  Some serious stuff. Star boys can kiss my dead dog's level nut.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:24.540]  And here's the boss now. And that is Rich. Hey, how are you? Hey, it's awesome to meet you. I've
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:28.140]  talked to you for a while, but soon to see you in person. Yeah. Thanks for having us here home.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:31.820]  Yeah, thanks for being here. Thank you. Glad to finally meet you.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:36.380]  Living up boys, you're welcome. You're in a hospitable environment here.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.740]  And don't give this polite **** what's I let you on my ranch, you're my friends.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.420]  And as friendly as I am, I'm prepared to kill each other.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:51.740]  And I think the most important thing we can say, if I do say so myself, that I just have to know
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:59.260]  what that most important thing is. Before we get into the disaster that surrounds us, the dishonesty,
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:06.380]  the political pressure. We should celebrate the good stuff. There are so many great Americans out
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:12.780]  there that get up early and bust their **** and live by the truth logic and common sense that we
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:19.420]  celebrate and promote. It is alive and well across this country. And here's to them. At the feed mill,
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:27.740]  at the hardware store, at the grocery store, at the coffee shop, at the schools, at the churches,
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:34.860]  everywhere I go. It's like truth logic and common sense. Second amendment, absolutists, earning
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:40.060]  your own way, saving for a rainy day, giving to the needy instead of expecting Uncle Sam to take
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:47.340]  care of them. So what you and I live by is not rare. It is a protein ubiquity across this country.
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.940]  And they're trying to steal it because they're desperate and know that they've lost the culture
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:58.780]  war. They really have. And academia, media, the hell, the government itself in Hollywood.
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:06.940]  In my 70 years of clean and sober radar in my world around me, I watched the dumbing down of
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:13.500]  America manifest itself in all things liberal, Democrat, Rhino, anti-constitutional, infringement,
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:21.100]  oath violation that is running amok. But in spite of that, I'm living the American dream every day.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:27.180]  I hunt, I fish, I shoot, I make music, I tour, I do charity work, I hang with working hard, playing
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:32.460]  hard Americans. So the positive spirit is still soaring across this country.
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.580]  Well, I gotta tell you, I needed thousands of interviews during the election and everybody
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:39.340]  gets credit. But if you hadn't worked your ass off so hard, I don't know from what I got in.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:47.980]  I don't remember sleeping in 2016. What I did is I focused on the, they called Michigan, Wisconsin,
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:53.740]  Pennsylvania, the reliably blue states. Every time they reported, what a nasty thing to say,
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:58.380]  the reliably blue states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. So I focused my attention on those
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:06.060]  three states. And I wallpaper and carpet bomb the media, scolding the conservatives, the licensed
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:11.100]  hunters of those states, 800,000 per state. And I scolded them that they didn't vote for
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:17.340]  McCain and Romney. You can't blame them, really, because McCain and Romney didn't represent anything
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:22.540]  that we believe in. But by not voting for McCain and Romney, they gave it to Barack Obama.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:27.740]  And they got all the judges. Yeah, I went really nuts on them. And I didn't do it alone. But that
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:32.940]  was the driving force in those reliably blue hell zones, because those states are not reliably blue.
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:37.100]  In fact, it's important to know to talk about the positive. You look at a map of America,
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:43.820]  political map, and it's just red as can be, except for the little blue high crime smudges
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:51.500]  of liberal Democrat insanity, where liberal Democrats have, literally, brainwashed people to
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:57.500]  think that they don't have to earn their own way, and that self defense is not desirable and unarmed
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.500]  helplessness and gun free zones will somehow keep us safe. And if you think about it, those little
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:07.980]  cancer spots across the red blooded map know that their time is running out. They admit that.
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:13.180]  My favorite thing is not that you and I and everybody I know agree with logic, truth, and
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:18.460]  common sense. My favorite thing is watching liberals and Democrats attempt to make their
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:24.780]  points on television and not knowing how stupid they look. They are the masters of shooting
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:29.180]  themselves in the foot. So if you and I were to have a date with God, which by the way,
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:37.100]  I think we do. And we said, God, could you design our foil? Could you design someone who could actually
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:47.820]  look so obnoxious and rude and dishonest and unkempt to counter what we believe in?
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:51.500]  He go, I already did. Maybe Michael Moore. Exactly. Nancy Pelosi. Or Hillary Clinton.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:56.300]  Or Hillary Clinton. Nor Barack Obama. Or Eric Holder. Or W. Litch. My favorite is, I think,
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:02.220]  the Democrats, when they put forth the Pelosi's and the Boxers, and especially the Maxine Waters
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:08.060]  and the Sheila Jackson Lee's, they struggle to form syllables. I couldn't have gone to Central
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:13.500]  Caster and go, could you create a big dirt bag to represent the... Or the guy from Georgia that
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:20.620]  thinks islands float. Perfect. Exactly. Let him talk. Give him the microphone. My fear is that the
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:31.740]  whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize. Sacred is the
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:36.300]  Second Amendment is. The First Amendment is not important because we can say what we want.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:41.500]  It's because idiots can say what they want. So the rest of us will go, gosh, that's an idiot.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:47.660]  So I think we're in a good place right now. And I think the fact that the left is so
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:54.300]  brain-dead and comfortably numb with political correctness and fake news and dishonesty that
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:59.500]  they're doing a better job than we are. No, I agree. But since we're here getting the Second
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:05.260]  Amendment, we're seeing right now the biggest purge online of conservative sites, veteran sites,
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:10.300]  gun sites, shooting clubs, Christian sites. I've never seen such a purge. Oh, I've been,
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:16.300]  I've been thrown off. I won't mention any names now in hopes that the negotiations can continue
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:23.420]  and move forward on an honest level. But I have been thrown out by the biggest promoters in the
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:29.900]  world because I'm on the board of the NRA. And I promise you, if I was recently arrested for
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:36.060]  heroin distribution, they would have not thrown me off exactly. But because I'm on the board of
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:41.260]  the Family Grassroots Organization of the National Rifle Association that stands for self-defense,
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:47.660]  I've been thrown off tens of millions of dollars in revenue. Look at all the claims that I'm a
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:52.140]  child. No, Ted Nugent back in 2011 was kind of a voice crying out in the wilderness against
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:56.380]  anti-PC. We'll be back with more on the other side. This is Alex Jones, show I'm Jake Lloyd.

[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:03.900]  It looks like America is starting to wake up from the lies and disinformation. 77% of Americans
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:09.820]  polled recently by Monmouth University believe that the old legacy media like CNN and the New York
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:15.900]  Times regularly report fake news. The survey asked respondents, do you think these sources report
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:20.620]  these stories on purpose in order to push an agenda or do they tend to report them more by
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:26.460]  accident or because of poor fact checking? The majority of respondents at 42% said they believe
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:32.140]  it is to push an agenda while 26% went with poor fact checking. Additionally, the survey found
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:38.060]  that 83% believe special interest groups are intentionally trying to implant false information
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:43.180]  into the news cycle and even more believed those tentacles reached all the way into social media
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:48.860]  sites and YouTube. And it's not just conservatives who are waking up to the obvious bias and propaganda
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:20:16.860]  pushing of the legacy media. A whopping 61% of Democrats are in agreement. You are fake news.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:32.540]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:38.940]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, Alex Jones. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm Jake
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:43.660]  Lloyd. One of our allies crashing through the lies and disinformation is Ted Nugent,
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:48.300]  a great patriot that we interviewed. Alex Jones particularly interviewed a few weeks back. We're
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:55.180]  going back to the special interview right now. But I have been thrown out by the biggest promoters
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:21:01.660]  in the world because I'm on the board of the NRA and I promise you, if I was recently arrested
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:07.500]  for heroin distribution, they would have not thrown me off exactly. But because I'm on the
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:11.980]  board of the family grassroots organization of the National Rifle Association that stands for
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:19.420]  self-defense, I've been thrown off tens of millions of dollars in revenue. Look at all the claims that
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:26.380]  I'm a child molester, a draft dodger, that I diss the Native Americans. It's all lies. What nasty
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:31.420]  things, especially my relationship with the Native Americans. I've been invited to almost every Native
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:38.540]  American tribe to teach their children the Native lifestyle of clean and sober, hands-on
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:46.700]  conservation, self-sufficiency, hunting, fishing, outdoor conservation, shared sweat lodges with
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:54.220]  their spiritual leaders. Since the 60s, I have been given felonious eagle feather war bonnets by
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:59.740]  the elders of numerous tribes because I, in my song Great White Buffalo and in my promotion of
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:04.620]  conservation, especially bow hunting, they feel a kinship, a blood brotherhood there with me. So
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:10.780]  meanwhile, the Native Americans and I are spiritual blood brothers, so the Huffington Post claims that
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:19.100]  I called him unclean vermin. And then some people actually fell for it. So you can see that as I
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:23.420]  say these things, as nasty and horrific and dishonest as they are, you notice I'm still smiling.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:28.380]  It is a pain in the purge because I agree with you, they know that culturally they've lost the
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:32.780]  soul of America. I mean, you go to the Rolling Stone articles attacking you and I this week,
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:38.220]  they'll get one or two comments. Your side has thousands per story, so it's mine and 50 times
[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:41.980]  the traffic. That's what I'm saying. You're right, they have had a cardiac arrest, they're falling
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:45.900]  apart, but I don't want to underestimate their counter-accident. No, no, we don't, we don't,
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:50.460]  doesn't mean that we are complacent by any stretch of the imagination. I think political correctness
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:58.300]  has backfired and even though fake news and the orchestrated lies of the media, starting in the
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:04.060]  late sixties, quite honestly, some people fell for it. But then when they really tune in and pay
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:09.900]  attention, they see how dishonest it is. And my backing and my support is at an all-time high
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:14.140]  right now. I couldn't be more, I couldn't be more proud. That's what I, that's why I mentioned the
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:19.900]  good, honest, smart, intelligent, hands-on asset column Americans, those are my blood brothers.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:23.500]  I'll be clear, I'm not trying to like do propaganda for the enemy and say boy, they're
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:29.100]  powerful. I'm saying they have proven that they are totally and completely ruthless and Apple is
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:33.900]  moving to China. People. Apple is moving to China and it's going to hire the Chinese government
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:38.620]  to actually oversee internet censorship worldwide and tending its works. They just removed Easter
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:43.020]  off the calendar. I saw it. And when they contacted Apple said, yeah, we did do that.
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:49.260]  I mean, this is just, I mean. And the Southern Poverty Law Center is now in charge of censorship
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:53.660]  in social media. The Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the worst racist hate groups in the history
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:58.380]  of the world. And everybody knows it except the comfortably known stoners who just hate freedom
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:04.700]  and hate the Constitution and hate hardworking people because they, you know, I deserve, I deserve
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:10.620]  to have my college tuition waived. A bunch of dirt bags. I mean, you look at the average Ted
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:16.220]  Nugentator and I couldn't be more proud. I'm more proud of that than the great people that I connect
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:20.860]  with. Growing up, it's like I didn't have to have Twilight Zone or Mad Magazine or One Fleur
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:25.980]  or the Cuckoo's Nest or the Planet of the Apes or Clockwork Orange. I got the media, academia,
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:32.300]  Hollywood and half of our government to keep me entertained. But even as I chuckle, stating these
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:39.980]  things, because you have to laugh or you'll, you'll cry. If I didn't believe that conservative values,
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:47.180]  basic constitutional bill of rights, golden rule, 10 commandments, common sense was alive and well.
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:52.300]  I'm not even going to say publicly what I would do, but you don't damn well what I would do. But I
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:59.180]  believe that that positive force is going to win in the end and that we are winning incrementally
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:05.580]  every day, even though the media is in their scramble to dishonestly create fake news as
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:10.940]  representing otherwise. I believe the positive spirit is as strong as it's ever been. And because
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:15.020]  the spirit is coming back, it makes it that much more important. Don't you feel that we've
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:18.940]  got to fight and win and to realize what we're up against because we've really drawn out the
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:24.220]  other side to show they're true America hating evil. They're true prosperity hating evil. Then I
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:28.780]  ask, why do they love communism? Why do they love collapse? Be careful asking those questions. I have
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:34.700]  people asking me, well, why would they want to ban this bullet or this? And I don't go down the Y
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:39.740]  road. If you start asking why, why does a woman who gets up there and says you don't need to read
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:45.900]  this, you need to sign it to find out what's in it. I mean, why wasn't she tackled on the house floor
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:53.340]  and handcuffed and given some sort of treatment? You don't ask why. Just know that evil dishonesty
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:58.940]  and scam artists have always been around. And that right now they're liberal, they're Democrat,
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:04.220]  they're rhinos, they're Hollywood, they're fake news, they're media, they're academia and they're
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:09.580]  half of our government at least. So come to that realization. There are rabid coyotes running
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:14.300]  around. You don't wait till you see one to go get your gun. Keep your gun handy and every time you
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:18.700]  see one you shoot one. They're trying to conquer us. I can feel their will. I can see it. They're
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:23.660]  control freaks. So for me, it's such an animating contest just to get them off my back. Well,
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:27.980]  and that's why they hate me so much because I'm uncontrollable. And in all this observation of
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:32.460]  the good, the bad and the ugly, it's important to note that my name is Ted Nugent. I'm entering my
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:38.220]  70th rock and roll year of the American dream, my 70th hunting season. I have 14 grandkids and
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:42.060]  seven wonderful kids, the most beautiful, dangerous wife in the world, the greatest hunting dogs in
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:48.060]  the world. I have machine guns and everything I want in life, the best sounding band, the best
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:52.860]  grinding rhythm and blues rock and roll band in the world. But there's the most important thing I
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:58.060]  can say is there's only one thing more dangerous than a sow grizzly bear with cubs nearby. And
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:03.420]  that's Ted Nugent with more confidence. We have reached critical mass and I'm walking every greasy
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:23.980]  glory rhythm and blues Motown Bear Ruffles.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:35.260]  When all hell breaks loose, I go back to the sanctity of perfection.
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:41.740]  Not only do I want to make America great again, I want to make America healthy again. So that's
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:46.700]  one of the things that I'm working on. We can't control everything that's going on right now,
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:52.780]  but we can control how we're feeling and how we're exercising and living our daily lives. And
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:28:00.060]  we're not perfect. Ted and I eat kind of whatever we want, but 80% of what we eat is pure lean
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:05.180]  protein, venison, lots of veggies, but you've got to take care of yourself. Who wants to stand
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:10.860]  in line waiting for the doctors, go into the hospital? Not me. So I'm going to take care of
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:15.340]  myself. Well, she may have a Queen of the Forest segment on her Spirited Wild Show. It's been the
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:21.100]  number one show for 28 years on Outdoor Channel. I can't imagine why. And her Queen of the Forest
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:28.140]  is a reach out. It's educate. Well, I started it because I wasn't raised in a hunting family.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:34.540]  My dad didn't hunt. I never had been around. Never touched a gun. She met me or rock and roll.
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:39.420]  We'll be right back to Ted Nugent and Alex Jones, two of the greatest American patriots in the modern
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:44.460]  area, two of the greatest American voices of the present moment. We'll be right back. This is the

[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:35.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. My name is Jake Lloyd, your host filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:41.420]  We are about to go back to the Ted Nugent interview. It's great. I'm enjoying it just as much as you
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:44.460]  are. I'm sure Ted Nugent was one of the first people I started paying attention to when I was
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:49.980]  younger, getting into politics. So let's go back right now to the Ted Nugent interview Firestorm.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:57.340]  I started it because I wasn't raised in a hunting family. My dad didn't hunt. I never had been around
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:02.860]  guns. Never touched a gun until she met me. Or rock and roll, but that's another story. So I was
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:09.420]  basically baptized by fire walking into Ted's world and I realized, wow, I'm actually a tomboy
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:15.100]  at heart. I used to race motocross. She was a motocross champion. I loved getting my hands dirty
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:22.140]  and I loved being outdoors. So this really fit in with my lifestyle, the hunting outdoor adventure
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:27.660]  lifestyle. But I realized there's a lot of women. What if they never had that opportunity to be
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:33.980]  exposed to hunting or guns? How would they feel? So I took women who hunt, women who don't hunt.
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:40.380]  I paired them together and I let them sit in a tree stand and watch nature unfold because if
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:45.020]  you've never hunted, how can you have an opinion about it? If you've never shot a gun, how can
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:52.940]  you have an opinion about it? Healing powers of nature and 100% of the non-hunting women fell
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:59.660]  in love with it. Many of them were either already anti-hunting or inclined to be anti-hunting with
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:05.580]  the propaganda, their cowards because they murdered defenseless animals until they realized
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:10.780]  that it's about conservation, wise use, balancing of wildlife and each and every one of them were
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:14.940]  chained by them. And we do it all the time. You remember when I had Anthony Bourdain out here who
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:20.460]  is a liberal left-wing anti-gun zealot from Manhattan? Within 15 minutes of him shooting some
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:25.420]  of my guns, he went, this is so much fun, I can't believe it. He's eating griniot on his face and
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:34.460]  it's escapable. I've done that with thousands of people. I have literally eliminated the brainwashing
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:41.580]  of thousands of people just by honestly articulating the joys of aim small, miss small, marksmanship,
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:46.220]  the mystical flight of the arrow and the healing powers of nature. And the most dramatic and profound
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:52.540]  example is my 50-year-old son, Fleetwood, Theodore Fleetwood Nugent, who I put up for adoption in
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:36:00.140]  1968 and we got back together when he was 42, raised in New York City, surrounded by liberal
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:05.980]  propaganda all his life, voted for Barack Obama, and I sat down, it was an emotional reunion.
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:14.060]  So here we have the poster child of liberal indoctrination and he discovered that Ted Nugent
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:19.740]  was his dad. So once he came out and had more texts of culture shock, which only lasted a
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:24.620]  couple of minutes because I hugged him, we cried, we celebrated our lost time and how we're going
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:31.180]  to be dedicated to make up for it, father, son of blood and spirit. And not five minutes later,
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:42.700]  I completely reversed his anti-gun brainwashing. I completely reversed his anti-conservative
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:47.740]  liberal policies because he owns three restaurants and I explained to him why all those regulations
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:54.940]  destroy his bottom line. And you could see he would wince a bit, furrow his brow and go,
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:00.620]  boy, dad, I never thought of it like that. We took him to the firing range and I said,
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:07.260]  there's a tool, handle it with care, conscientiously, and he fell in love with the shooting sports,
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:19.420]  fell in love with hunting. So I promise with sincere genuine articulation, you can eliminate
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:27.180]  the liberal brainwashing of any age, a kid, a grown man, an old man, an old woman,
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:35.100]  with just a few moments of articulating why it's wrong, the evidence that is unlimited evidence
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:41.020]  to prove that liberal policies destroy everything, and the unlimited evidence that the Constitution,
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:44.700]  the Bill of Rights, the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, and a work ethic is the only path
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:51.980]  to quality of life. The truth will metastasize. The truth will spread the more we can get our
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:56.940]  side, conservatives, people in the asset column, people who work for a living, people who believe
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:03.420]  in the self-evident truth in our founding documents. They are with us, but the dumbing down of America
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:09.740]  didn't just hit leftists, it's hit the conservatives as well. And there's a lot of knee-jerk over
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:15.580]  reaction going on. And the minute Donald Trump even invites someone from the other side, a lot of
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:19.660]  our friends will go, why is he even dealing with those people? He should never talk to those people.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:25.500]  Well, that's not how you get things done. And I know how he operates. There's a term, and I'll
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:31.260]  give it to you, and you can beep at whatever you want. But what drives the American dream and quality
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:36.860]  of life are shit-kickers, people who bust their ass to be in the asset column, make sacrifices and
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:42.380]  take risks, entrepreneurs, welders and carpenters, and hard-working ranchers and farmers and guitar
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:48.460]  players, and people that know they have to be productive. That's what makes America great
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:54.220]  every day, always has, always will. But a lot of our side will get angry the minute you even give a
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:58.780]  nod to the other side, and you have to give a nod to the other side, so it encourages them to speak
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:05.660]  up, to expose their dishonesty and their horrible agenda. President Trump is the ultimate shit-kicker.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:11.100]  He is a strategist. You can't build an empire like that if you don't meet with all concerns
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:16.220]  and get them comfortable and get them to believe that you are listening to their points of view,
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:22.220]  no matter how absurd it is, so it knocks down their guard. Now, I'm not going to get any more
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:27.420]  detail in that, but all I can tell you is that when Donald Trump meets with maniacs like Dianne
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:32.380]  Feinstein, who will not let her constituents carry a gun, while she has a 38 in her purse,
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:38.780]  a king, a tyrant does that. That's why we wrote down after we shot the British at Concord Bridge
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:42.300]  that we can say what we want to say, we can choose our religion, we're going to have a media that
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:47.260]  was supposed to monitor the government, we have the right to keep and bear arms, not just the king,
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:50.540]  the people. We, the people, have the right to keep and bear arms. If you're trying to take away
[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:54.060]  from us, we'll shoot you. We're not slaves. We're not slaves. We're not slaves. We're not subject.
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:58.540]  We're free citizens. It was a brand new hallelujah experiment of self-government.
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:01.740]  It worked. Everybody wants to come here and now the left wants to blow it up.
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:09.500]  So here's the perfect thing. So you say America first and Democrats hate you. So who is first
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:25.260]  if not America, a dirt van? They claim it's a Russian plot to make America great again.
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:17.660]  We know the media has lied about me since the 1960s because I'm a hunter and I'm a gun advocate
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:22.700]  and more and more people are waking up and get wiser every day and they're realizing what this
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:26.940]  fake news thing is all about. That's why Donald Trump is such an important guy because he finally
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:31.500]  put the spotlight on the fake news cockroaches and people are getting smarter all the time and
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:35.260]  there's more and more support for truth logic and common sense. We celebrate it every damn day.
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:42.220]  Follow Ted Nugent's lead. You can't just watch shows like this. You can't just watch interviews.
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:48.220]  You have to go out there into the world. Bring new converts into the liberty movement. Practice
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:52.780]  those traditions in your real life. This is the epic Ted Nugent interview. This is the Alex Jones
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:43:06.860]  show. My name is Jake Lloyd. We'll be right back on the other side with more. Thank you for watching.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:52.460]  I'm the national rifle.
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:59.340]  America and I'm freedom's safest place. We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:04.220]  and I make it really easy. We went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:10.700]  that are healthy for energy stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:14.220]  than some of the best selling formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and looked,
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:17.740]  what is the top? What is the best? We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it better.
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:24.220]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60. We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:31.820]  It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top of the line new tropic for $19.95. Believe me,
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:36.540]  we're selling it for $35 on average. We need that $15, $20. We make the fund this operation
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:40.700]  in the face of the global threat of it. But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:45.500]  in two weeks. I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in. And I want people that
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:50.940]  haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why. It's got 6,000 plus five star reviews.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:56.140]  It's amazing. Infowarsstore.com, infowarslive.com or AAA 2533139.
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:03.740]  The Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged the discovery of a rogue network of cellular
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:08.620]  eavesdropping devices discovered throughout Washington DC. The devices can be mounted in
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:14.220]  vehicles, drones, helicopters and airplanes and are often used by spies and criminals to track
[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:20.060]  an eavesdrop on private cellular devices. The agency did not say how many devices were detected
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:25.020]  or where they found them. American intelligence and law enforcement agencies routinely use
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:30.300]  similar eavesdropping equipment in the field. The Stingray units operate by tricking a cellular
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:35.420]  device into locking onto them instead of a legitimate cell tower. Stingray devices allow
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:40.940]  the user to gain highly specific information on the location of any particular phone down to a
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:46.940]  particular apartment complex or hotel room. More sophisticated versions can eavesdrop on calls by
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:53.420]  forcing phones to step down to the older unencrypted 2G wireless channel. Some Stingray devices can
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:59.820]  even plant malware on a phone. Lee and McAdooInfoWars.com. You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:05.820]  about the 60 plus products, we have an Infowars Live. It'd take hours. Michael ZX Plus now has
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:10.540]  a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast,
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:17.100]  the mold, the candida. It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.

[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:52.140]  just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:47:06.940]  spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:21.340]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I am your fill and host, Jake Lloyd. You're watching an
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:27.900]  inside look that Ted Nugent granted us, the Infowars crew, into his life on his ranch.
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:33.900]  This is the Ted Nugent interview, Firestorm. I think most of the dirt bags on the left hate me
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:38.940]  because I'm so damn happy. I mean, I come out here and I got all these bows and arrows. I let
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:46.380]  it come out here every day. And I take, I think arrow with my name on it. And I come out here
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:51.740]  with Shaman and we shoot our bows every day. We go to the range a lot. If you don't do it, you can
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:56.700]  learn something from Ted Nugent. It is the following. Get yourself a bow and arrow.
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:05.820]  And when you are looking at your target and you're preparing to draw your bow, it goes all the way
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:14.780]  back to the origins of Zen. And the mystical flight of the arrow right here tunes out everything
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:22.380]  liberal, everything democratic. And you become the path of your arrow with life. I just hit
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:28.300]  the booger I was aiming at. Look out, there's Alex in the hole. And it's real touchy trigger,
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:34.780]  real touchy. Get that top pin in that top peep and sweep. Nicely done. I'm usually dead on with a
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:39.020]  bow, but I'm actually sweating because Ted Nugent is watching. It's like guitars, women and guns,
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:46.780]  man. It's got to be fit for you. All right, let's see. Okay. And just zero that in there
[01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:52.620]  and just squeeze that son of a bitch. There you go. Double lungs, brother. All right, good.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:05.020]  I've studied Columbine, Virginia Tech, San Bernardino, Sandy Hook. I've studied Aurora.
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:10.860]  I studied the Paul's Night Club. I studied all these mass slaughters. In every one of those
[01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:17.500]  instances, there were good Americans who would have been armed and capable of stopping the shooter,
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:23.820]  but law forbid them to be armed and prepared. When I finally realized what was occurring,
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:31.900]  I thought, I got him. And I reached for my purse. He was maybe 12 feet away. You know,
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:36.220]  is it possible my gun could be insured? Is it possible I could have missed sure? But I can tell
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:42.700]  you, I've hit much smaller targets at much greater distances. But then I realized that a couple of
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:48.860]  months earlier, I had made the stupidest decision of my life. I took my gun out of my purse and left
[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:55.260]  it in my car. Because as you well know, in the state of Texas, it's sometimes a felony offense to
[01:49:55.260 --> 01:50:01.100]  carry a gun in your purse. It is San Bernardino. In that building, there were Americans in California
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:04.620]  that would have carried a gun and could have responded to the shooter if they were allowed to
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:10.700]  by law. In the Paul's Night Club, in Sandy Hook, in Virginia Tech, in Columbine, there were people
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:16.220]  that would have been armed. They were unarmed and helpless because the law forced them to be
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:22.540]  unarmed and helpless. As I mentioned, I'm not really mad at the guy that did this. And I'm
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:26.460]  certainly not mad at the guns that did this. They didn't walk in there by themselves and pull
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:31.580]  their own triggers. The guy that did it was a lunatic. That's like being mad at a rabid dog.
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:37.500]  I'm mad at my legislators for legislating me out of the right to protect myself and my family.
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:43.660]  Now, myself, I've never been in a gun threesome. Because as soon as I arrive, it fails to be one.
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:51.100]  But unarmed and helplessness is a self-inflicted curse and an intellectually dishonest and not
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:59.100]  vacuous choice to be a victim. So all we have to do is reverse the great society and the new deal
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:05.500]  zombies of the liberal Democrats scourge and start in the 50s and 60s and teach people that
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:10.140]  unarmed and helpless is dangerous and asking for trouble. You know, the problem today is though
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:17.660]  there are a lot of people, especially women, in my situation, I wasn't born and raised in a hunting
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:25.260]  family or surrounded by guns in my family. So had I not married you, I don't know how I would have
[01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:31.180]  thought. And you wouldn't have been very happy. I would not have been happy at all. No venison.
[01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:37.820]  Yes. No saving happy. I do have a lot of friends that I find myself educating them about gun ownership
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:44.540]  and that they're ignorant about what it really takes. And I mentioned to them,
[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:50.940]  every time I've been around you and your teenage girls, I've been armed and I'm not dangerous.
[01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:58.780]  So it's interesting that I think the problem now is that we have to educate people who really have
[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:07.980]  no idea what to do and they're scared and they get misinformation. They hear about big, you know,
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:14.700]  ARs and assault weapons and, you know, I could assault you with, I could actually. Yes, I could.
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:20.540]  Well, bottom line is that dumbing down of America, we're witnessing the manifestation
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:27.820]  of a cultural abandonment where people literally are hyper fearful of a simple firearm. When I was
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:32.780]  growing up, everybody understood firearms as a standard tool, like a blow torch or a steak knife
[01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:38.620]  or a jackhammer or a chainsaw. And didn't you say you used to bring your guns? Well, here's a great
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:44.540]  story. All right, yeah. This is going to be the greatest Alex Jones story. You want that, don't you?
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:52.060]  You need this. So there it was. There it was, in 1966 at St. Vidar's High School outside of Chicago.
[01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:58.620]  It's an all boys Catholic Academy and I was in the future priest club. Well, sure I was.
[01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:05.420]  It was just before I wrote Wang Dang's report. So I'm in the future priest club at the All Boys
[01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:10.540]  Catholic Academy, and we're going to the future priest club weekend retreat. And we're going to
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:19.340]  learn about Kyrie or LaSone and the blood is the wine and the thing is the body. All this voodoo
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:25.340]  stuff, which is I was fat. I was just not paying any attention. I had a rock and roll, but I had
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:32.220]  the Amboy Dukes. We're kicking more ass than the stones. So I'm going to the future priest club retreat
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:37.980]  and I go watch. I know where that is. There's a lot of woods over there. So I took my dad's 1187
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:45.180]  12 gauge pump. It breaks down snow. We're too trench gun. I put that 12 gauge in a box of six
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:49.580]  shot in my little bag. And I went to the future priest club retreat when everybody else was going
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:54.060]  to the seminars. I put that son bitch together, loaded that up with number six shot when I was
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:54:01.420]  squirrel hunting every day. So here I am. Um, an uppity individually rather spirited almost,
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:08.380]  you know, I take back the word almost defiant young man. And I got a 12 gauge shotgun in a
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:15.500]  gun free zone outside of Chicago shooting squirrels problems to society is zero. All my buddies before
[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:20.300]  opening day have guns season for the deer season. All had their rifles and shotguns in their trucks
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:29.100]  in some in school lockers problems in society zero access to firearms 100% unlimited school
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:35.820]  shootings is zero. Now you have firearms more restricted access to firearms more difficult
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:41.660]  today than ever in American history. And you have this because it's the coming down. It is the
[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:48.860]  the brainwashing failure to teach our children what the trail of tears was. No kids know what
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:53.420]  the trail of tears. Everybody knows the trail of tears. It was our version of the baton death march.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:55:00.380]  And nobody knows what the rape of man king was. So we don't believe that man could be so evil.
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:06.380]  Man could be so evil. Might want to check out the Auschwitz tapes. So meanwhile, if you're
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:13.260]  denied the information of such abject evil, you can pretend that peace and love is the answer
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:19.100]  and that why can't we all just get along that manifestation of cultural deprivation now
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:24.860]  scares the entire left agenda and it manifests itself and people being afraid of a simple pistol
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:28.380]  when in fact the simple pistol could save your family's life.
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:38.540]  The timing of every one of these shootings if they were using a bird gun with buckshot
[01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:44.140]  they could have killed more people per shot fired than with any AR-15 because nobody's resisting.
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:49.340]  Three and a half inch triple odd buck literally is a cinderblock wall destroyer. You can be behind
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:53.260]  a cinderblock wall and I could take five of these. The first two will take out the wall the rest of
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:58.620]  them will cut you in half. Well these are what we use when we back up bear and lion hunters.
[01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:05.740]  These are three and a half inch magnum double odd bucks and each round shoots over 30 pellets.
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:11.820]  So it's like every time I pull the trigger once with that round it's 30 people shooting 30 bullets
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:18.540]  come out of there 30 rounds come out of this. So this is a standard AR-15 that Eugene Stoner
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:24.940]  invented in the 1950s. It's a semi-automatic sporting rifle. It is not a weapon of war.
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:31.100]  No society would be so irresponsible to send heroes of the military into war with a semi-automatic
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:37.580]  weapon. It is not an assault rifle and it is not a weapon of war. It is a standard American family
[01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:43.500]  modern sporting rifle that shoots one bullet per trigger pull one trigger pull one bullet.
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:50.540]  It shoots a 22 caliber bullet and it's available everywhere because it's such an effective wonderful
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:58.300]  home defense hunting competition family weekends you know families in America millions of them
[01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:04.460]  every weekend shoot their guns problems in society is zero here goes a couple shots
[01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:11.820]  so you can see it makes a little 22 caliber hole in the target
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:23.820]  and then you would have to ask an honest person so you would feel okay if your kids were killed
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:29.500]  with a goose gun because you're afraid of an AR because who can't get a goose gun or a pheasant
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:33.740]  gun or a no-gun I would not encourage the breach of the law in any way but do you really can you
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:39.100]  imagine somebody being sent to jail for stopping a mass shooting in a gun-free zone with their own
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:43.900]  personal weapon I personally can't but I'm not advocating you do that my name is Jake Lodwell

[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:32.620]  of filming just a couple weeks back please stay tuned for the rest of it in this next hour we
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:38.460]  will be going to i wanted to take a couple minutes at the beginning of this hour to talk about china
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:43.580]  and the economy because we're seeing you know if you look at if you look at drudge right now
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:49.260]  a bunch of the headlines are all talking about china and the trade war the tariff war that we
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:54.620]  are experiencing right now under the leadership of president trump right all up there in the top
[02:00:54.620 --> 02:01:00.940]  left corner china warren's arrogant america trump threatens 100 billion more tariffs dow down 500
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:07.020]  you see all of these different headlines so does china really have all that much power
[02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:14.060]  we have a lot more leverage and i think people are willing to admit at least people on the left
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:21.180]  neo cons you know ben Shapiro types who who disagree with the idea of a trade war libertarian
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:26.140]  types who don't think that the government should play any role in economics at all but unfortunately
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:34.140]  a libertarian nation has to play ball with the rest of the world's nation so how much ammo does china
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:42.140]  have not as much as you think and that relies upon or excuse me that is related to the role of the
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:50.140]  united states dollar in the global trades agree in the global trade system because the dollar is not
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:56.140]  just used in the united states the dollar is used internationally and just because the dollar
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:02:02.140]  is treated as the international reserve currency the united states is essentially the bank of the
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:09.140]  world so we can get more into china and america and our trade tariffs with each other those
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:14.140]  different things but the u.s. dollar is essentially the reserve currency for the world under the
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:22.860]  breton woods program in the 1940s america became the world's reserve currency under the gold standard
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:27.340]  and that you know you can other countries could exchange the dollar for us gold that went away
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:34.700]  with nixon however in the 70s the u.s. struck a deal with saudi arabia that all oil sales would be
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:40.860]  priced in the denominations of the u.s. dollar which means you know because oil is is basically
[02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:48.380]  the world's most in high demand commodity or resource so everyone because most people go
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:54.060]  through the middle east obviously russia and a few other nations the u.s. has has massive oil
[02:02:54.060 --> 02:03:00.700]  reserves and oil in the ground still so it's not everyone has to do this but every nation in the
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:05.260]  world virtually every nation has to go through saudi arabia and the other opaque nations in
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:09.980]  order to get oil which means that if china now china could go through russia they can go through
[02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:15.180]  other but it the effect is that every nation has to go through the u.s. dollar which means they
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:22.860]  have to buy u.s. dollars they have to buy bonds in the government so look into that whenever
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:28.460]  you're thinking about china's ability to beat us in a trade war they're more reliant on the
[02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:32.380]  dollar than you think and if they went to go to a petro you on they'd have to totally restructure
[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:36.620]  their economy they'd have to stop flooding markets with their cheap chinese goods so
[02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:40.860]  so we have more leverage than you think please have faith in what president trump is doing at
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:46.860]  least in this aspect he is doing the right thing please stay tuned april 12th we will be having

[02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:38.780]  a little 22 caliber hole in the target and then you would have to ask an honest person so you feel
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:44.780]  okay if your kids were killed with a goose gun because you're afraid of an ar because who can't
[02:06:44.780 --> 02:06:49.100]  get a goose gun or a pheasant gun or a dope gun this is a goose gun this is a gun this is a pheasant
[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:55.100]  gun and loaded with standard ammunition that's available everywhere the first fully automatic
[02:06:55.100 --> 02:07:00.380]  rifles go back to the deck guns because they were shooting out a bunch of grapes i mean that's what
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:06.060]  this is this is the originals this is the original assault rifle well again my my sheriff buddy
[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:10.540]  showed me his pen the other day that if you wanted to it would be an assault pen because i could assault
[02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:17.900]  you with it so here's a standard sporting shotgun with double odd buck that you can buy at any hardware
[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:23.100]  store in any gun store and you should all around the world and by the way this range right here is
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:28.140]  about what the shooters had to deal with because no one resisted no one was trained how to fight back
[02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:32.940]  for how to deal with a shooter so a shooter with a with a goose gun could have done this fire in the
[02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:44.620]  holy clear it's really a wallop man that sucker kicks it's really a lot of power and i know i
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:50.860]  know this is just paper but it will show you the terminal ballistics of your standard firearms in
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:56.140]  america your standard sporting shotguns that we hunt rabbits and pheasants and quail and doves
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:03.260]  and turkeys and it's more deadly than an ar-15 this is one trigger squeeze of a 12 gauge shotgun with
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:10.300]  buck shot if you really want to crush the left and want to crush freedom haters not only should
[02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:14.540]  you be a member of the national rifle association but you should give away membership to everybody
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:19.900]  you know it work and church and school your family the nra should have 50 million members because i
[02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:24.700]  know there's over 100 million gun owners in this country and so far five to six million nra members
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:30.380]  are doing the hefty lifting for freedom that's right the giants only half awake and we're starting
[02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:34.860]  to win and we've just got to get the giant fully awake and restore the republic and people want to
[02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:39.100]  go to north korea or venezuela and live in hell they can go but here we're going to go back to what
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:49.020]  made the country great when president shrunk took the unprecedented the most politically incorrect
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:56.220]  move i have ever seen from a politician when he lifted the ban on trophies from africa importation
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:09:02.860]  what a hot button controversial issue that talking about political correctness so he reauthorized
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:08.540]  the importation of african trophies because we all know that if you don't have trophy hunting dollars
[02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:14.700]  there's no money for game wardens or radio telemetry or anti coaching squads so as soon as you ban a
[02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:21.580]  hunting area the poachers take over because there's no money to stop the poachers i mean who doesn't
[02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:28.300]  know this stop so president a lot of people don't know well by the point is the president does know
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:34.140]  this so he lifted the ban and none of the hunting organizations organizations came up and stood up
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:39.180]  with him so they had to rescind it he did a bold brave move then he had to rescind it because
[02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:44.780]  none of the people stood up for him sci nothing ducks eliminated nothing finaz nothing rocky mountain
[02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:49.340]  nothing wild turkey nothing so we're starting our organization called hunter's nation and
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:55.020]  donald trump jr is one of our directors alongside me and a bunch of chris colbeck and some great
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:59.020]  people in fact i'm gonna put you on it but hunter nation is going to pick up the slack when the
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:04.460]  president does something good if the people behind him don't rally i'd like to thank them for nothing
[02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:09.260]  it's it's in our hands it's not just up to our election i'm glad you're excited about the hammer
[02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:13.580]  these people what you said though when there's not hunting and there's not conservation like you
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:19.500]  said then there's no regulations prince burnhardt who founded the world wildlife fund got caught
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:24.140]  making zones in tiny and all these other areas no hunting so he could control the poachers and he
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:29.500]  got caught running billion dollar operations uh back in the 70s and 80s tell me tell me you know
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:35.500]  about president richard lakie and how he got caught selling the ivory from his protected elephants
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:43.820]  this is real important hunting fishing and trapping is perfect nature if you don't hunt fishing trap
[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:50.060]  the wildlife overruns its carrying capacity of habitat and they wipe it out and it's been documented
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:57.740]  google sabo tsa bo in kenya and watch what happens when you ban hunting the wildlife overpopulates
[02:10:57.740 --> 02:11:02.940]  and it becomes a moonscape within the years and not just to the elephants die but everything
[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:07.820]  is gone and then you got scott honey park in illinois you got uh brown county park in indiana
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:12.540]  where they did the same thing you got the uh kennysburg park in pennsylvania where they did
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:17.900]  allow hunting and there was nothing green it was a moonscape and the deer were tipping over with a
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:23.740]  thousand percent increase in highway deer accidents and human death so the point is you have to balance
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:29.500]  the wildlife every natural season of harvest thanksgiving to make room for next year's fawns
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:34.940]  and cubs and calves if you don't know that call 1-800-NUM-NUT and michael more will explain why
[02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:40.060]  you don't have to have personal hygiene hunting is perfect and every time you compromise it it comes
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:45.900]  from people who hate nature and hate wildlife they're ignorant and they're not they're worse than
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:50.860]  ignorant they know this they just well it's also overgracing when you don't have money it causes them
[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:57.180]  to eat down to the roots and then it floods out sure i was celebrating my 28th anniversary of the
[02:11:57.180 --> 02:12:03.740]  10 newton camp for kids it's a non-profit 501c3 all volunteer charity to teach kids about nation to
[02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:07.900]  be clean and sober and put their heart and soul into being the best that they can be the immediate
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:14.940]  zen of aim small miss small marksmanship and the mystical flight of the arrow hunting fishing
[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:22.060]  trapping wisdom ship planting trees putting more back into nature than you take out i mean just
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:27.260]  beautiful like mother teresa wishes she had a narrative that good and i was celebrated on my
[02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:32.220]  facebook and of course tens of millions this back when they before the facebook started cutting them
[02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:43.020]  off we had like 36 million responses and of the 36 million like 35 million 991 were just wonderful
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:48.460]  teaching kids about nature and clean and sober and working hard and playing hard and being the best
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:52.620]  that you can be and putting more back into nature than you take out but then somebody comes on and
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:13:00.060]  goes you're an evil bastard i hope your family dies of cancer for murdering the fessels animals
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:05.820]  but you can't make this stuff up i mean that's beyond the cuckoo's mess ross serling would have
[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:12.140]  not taken that concept for a rofer ishcock would have rejected the concept of that show so there
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:18.940]  are evil subhuman mongrels out there you've got to know that the neighbors are saying hello this
[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:27.980]  small arms fire i usually return with itself so i am not deterred i i in fact i'm more inspired
[02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:34.380]  now than i've ever been because i see that what i know to be truth logic and common sense is indeed
[02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:44.860]  universal in communities of spirit heart soul and intellect and education and honesty that that
[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:53.260]  truth logic and common sense is spreading beautifully and that's why the left and the fakers hate me
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:58.860]  and i couldn't be more perfect ten a lot of historians a lot of researchers say that you're
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:06.140]  almost like the first re-emergence of 1776 going back to the late 60s and 70s when you were doing
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:10.940]  things that are even called politically correct today that you really kind of led the re-emergence
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:15.100]  i figure whatever you're going to do you might as well do it all the way because if anything's worth
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:20.860]  getting into is get it's worth giving all your attention to and focusing on that given endeavor
[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:25.340]  to the point where you can apply your energies and your capabilities to making sure that you
[02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:30.300]  maximize the potential of any given endeavor and uh i only do a few things in life you know i raise
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:38.700]  my children i rock and roll and i hunt my fish and i uh like to go off in the mountains and stuff
[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:44.460]  four-wheel drive and then people uh like charleston has been helped but a lot of folks say you're
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:52.780]  patient zero the left does going back 45 50 years ago reigniting uh 1776 spirit i agree
[02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:58.220]  i just wanted to play chuck brian bow diddly music i just wanted to practice my guitar and
[02:14:58.220 --> 02:15:04.140]  outdo the ventures and lani mac and dwayne eddy so i had bands in detroit in the shadow of motown
[02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:11.660]  and when i was born in detroit everybody knows detroit was the global epicenter of work ethic
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:19.100]  and productivity neighborliness goodwill a work ethic that was unprecedented maybe in the history
[02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:25.420]  of our our species except for maybe glory in the year six when he finally got made fire
[02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:32.700]  so i was in such a positive environment where america had proven to the globe that if you have
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:39.900]  freedom you are more dedicated to good over evil and that's how we defeated the japs and the nazis
[02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:44.780]  you heard of here folks from ted newgent truth logic and common sense those are the only things
[02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:49.660]  you need in this world stay tuned this is the alex john show i'm jake loyde stay tuned for

[02:20:10.860 --> 02:20:15.580]  coming in and there are these isolated bubbles of insanity and i think by getting more insane
[02:20:15.580 --> 02:20:20.220]  and bullying more we'll submit but there's no put the genie back in the bottle and trying to suppress
[02:20:20.220 --> 02:20:25.260]  us is only making people seek us out that much more i'm going to be a historian to know that this
[02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:29.420]  is going to backfire him on big time i don't know where leftism and globalism is going to be in 10
[02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:33.820]  years as long as we stay course well it's certainly backfired on them and they tried to take me to
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:38.060]  task for doing what i knew was the right thing and meanwhile then they would start condemning me
[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:42.300]  because i wouldn't start their cocaine and i wouldn't smoke their dope because i had to get close to
[02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:46.380]  a white tail deer and i guess if you're comfortably numb you'll numb you'll end up buying chicken
[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:50.700]  so i wanted to be cocked like we're ready to run they're all dead by 70 and you look like you're
[02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:56.780]  50 yes so they're all dead by 70 and you look like you're 50 well i i i encountered when you look
[02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:02.620]  like you're a good shape 50 year old i i mean look at this guy 70 70 years old holy hell i mean
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:07.260]  that is just crazy i mean i didn't invent the middle finger but i perfected it a long time
[02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:13.660]  ago so my point is is that i i finally realized that i've i've hit a brick wall of insanity
[02:21:13.660 --> 02:21:17.820]  and i saw that it was a culture war and that they were against everything i believed in
[02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:22.620]  and so i just it inspired me to continue to stand up because i knew they were wrong i told
[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:26.540]  john belushi was going to die after he laughed at me for not snorting his cocaine i told jimmy
[02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:30.780]  henrichs he was going to die after he laughed at me for not taking this the pills i laughed to
[02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:35.980]  keith moon i said you're going to die and he laughed at me for not getting drunk i by scott laughed
[02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:40.140]  at me for not drinking his whiskey and i told him you're going to die and i can go on and on john
[02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:44.780]  edwards like i told all these guys that were going to die and they laughed at me and thought i was
[02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:52.380]  on the hip because i carried a gun and i murdered innocent animals what the it's like insanity so
[02:21:52.380 --> 02:21:57.100]  what they are as followers they got control of the leftist and and by these institutions that
[02:21:57.100 --> 02:22:02.220]  wanted to gild and masturbate america in the west and so they all lined up so that they could be
[02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:07.900]  big stars they all lined up and sold out you didn't and were still successful that is true americana
[02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:13.580]  that's maverick and i mean folks know you are one of the quintessential mavericks it's just true

[02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:51.620]  that's so essential to spread the word.
[02:31:51.620 --> 02:31:53.260]  Again, thank you so much for being part
[02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:54.940]  of the Second American Revolution.

[02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:59.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:07.380 --> 02:33:12.380]  You're listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:26.380]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:27.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:28.380]  Everybody, my name is Jake Lloyd.
[02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:31.380]  If you've been with us for a while now,
[02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:35.380]  you just witnessed the interview
[02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:38.380]  that Infowars conducted with Ted Nugent, Firestorm.
[02:33:38.380 --> 02:33:40.380]  He announced the debut of his new album
[02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:43.380]  to come out soon called The Music Made Me Do It.
[02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:45.380]  And Nugent is really an excellent example
[02:33:45.380 --> 02:33:47.380]  of living out your values,
[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:49.380]  not just talking about them politically.
[02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:52.380]  But now we're going to a video of Alex Jones,
[02:33:52.380 --> 02:33:55.380]  and we'll be right back after that.
[02:33:55.380 --> 02:33:58.380]  Adam, you're on the air from Florida. Go ahead.
[02:33:58.380 --> 02:34:03.380]  You versus Ken Guger, pay-per-view.
[02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:05.380]  At first, a little debate,
[02:34:05.380 --> 02:34:08.380]  and then maybe like wrestling or bare knuckles.
[02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:10.380]  I think you could, how much to charity
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:12.380]  do you think that could bring in?
[02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:17.380]  Well, again, I would love to bust that little demonic toad up.
[02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:19.380]  You know, in a fair fight or whatever,
[02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:20.380]  I'm not saying I'm going to hurt him
[02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:22.380]  physically unless he wanted to get into the ring with me.
[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:24.380]  He's a total coward.
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:27.380]  They've had me on their show years ago.
[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:29.380]  He can't debate me.
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:31.380]  None of them can debate me.
[02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:33.380]  The hag that's on the show ran up and said,
[02:34:33.380 --> 02:34:37.380]  get your effing fat bleep off the stage.
[02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:39.380]  He actually says, arrest people that call people fat,
[02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:41.380]  but she can say it to me.
[02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:43.380]  They spit iced tea in my face.
[02:34:43.380 --> 02:34:45.380]  We walked by. They said, hey, Alex, come over here.
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:47.380]  And I said, well, we're going over to the interview first,
[02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:48.380]  but I'll come back later.
[02:34:48.380 --> 02:34:49.380]  Then I kind of got lost wearing my hat,
[02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:50.380]  and he goes, no, they're over there.
[02:34:50.380 --> 02:34:52.380]  So they're doing a break. I see them go to break.
[02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:53.380]  I jump, hey, how you doing?
[02:34:53.380 --> 02:34:54.380]  He's acting nice.
[02:34:54.380 --> 02:34:56.380]  He sees Roger Stone, blows up, freaks out.
[02:34:56.380 --> 02:34:58.380]  Then they took our videos down.
[02:34:58.380 --> 02:34:59.380]  10 minutes after it happened,
[02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:01.380]  because it was the Google stage they were on,
[02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:04.380]  YouTube stage, as you can see right there.
[02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:06.380]  On screen for TV, we were 2 million views.
[02:35:06.380 --> 02:35:09.380]  Young Turks flip out on Alex Jones.
[02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:11.380]  And so that's what happened.
[02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:13.380]  Everybody was jumping on everybody's stages too.
[02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:15.380]  It wasn't like I was in their building on their facility.
[02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:17.380]  It was in a huge parking garage, air conditioned.
[02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:19.380]  They closed up with hundreds and hundreds
[02:35:19.380 --> 02:35:21.380]  of just open air booths.
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:24.380]  And like 10 feet from where I'm sitting,
[02:35:24.380 --> 02:35:25.380]  there's another booth.
[02:35:25.380 --> 02:35:27.380]  So everybody's everywhere.
[02:35:27.380 --> 02:35:29.380]  But they said he broke into our studio
[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:31.380]  and came into our building and got on and misrepresented.
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:33.380]  Because again, they're about preying on their audience.
[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:35.380]  But see, it's all just open air.
[02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:36.380]  There's other booths just right over there
[02:35:36.380 --> 02:35:37.380]  if you're watching on TV.
[02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:39.380]  But then I showed the right Bill Clinton shirt
[02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:42.380]  and they went crazy and said,
[02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:43.380]  okay, get out of here.
[02:35:43.380 --> 02:35:44.380]  And then Roger Stone was 20 feet away,
[02:35:44.380 --> 02:35:45.380]  not even on their stage.
[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:47.380]  They said, Roger Stone's trying to take over.
[02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:48.380]  Roger Stone's trying to take over.
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:49.380]  Get him out of here.
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:52.380]  Roger's like, if you, I'm not coming on your show.
[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:54.380]  So that's what happened.
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:55.380]  Of course it would get big ratings,
[02:35:55.380 --> 02:35:57.380]  but I would destroy him.
[02:35:57.380 --> 02:35:58.380]  Just like you go to a leftist march,
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:35:59.380]  none of them can talk.
[02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:00.380]  None of them are allowed to talk.
[02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:01.380]  They have talking points.
[02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:02.380]  They can't have real debates.
[02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:06.380]  He named his show after the Armenian genocide group.
[02:36:06.380 --> 02:36:07.380]  Go ahead, Adam.
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:09.380]  They're total hypocrite morons
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:12.380]  and you really showed it when they tried to fat shame you.
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:15.380]  And every time they,
[02:36:15.380 --> 02:36:17.380]  every time you bring up,
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:18.380]  every time Chang hears your name,
[02:36:18.380 --> 02:36:20.380]  the first thing he does is,
[02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:22.380]  oh, the lizard people, men on Mars
[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:23.380]  and things that you never said.
[02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:25.380]  It's only, he tries to just, you know,
[02:36:25.380 --> 02:36:26.380]  kind of almost like Hillary does
[02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:28.380]  when you call her out on something real.
[02:36:28.380 --> 02:36:30.380]  She just starts to laugh like it's a joke.
[02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:32.380]  But he'd like to change the subject
[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:33.380]  to something you've never done
[02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:35.380]  to try to discredit you.
[02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:37.380]  It would have huge ratings.
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:38.380]  And I would love,
[02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:40.380]  I'm not in that good of shape or whatever.
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:42.380]  He doesn't look like he's in the best shape,
[02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:44.380]  but I've lost a lot of weight from what I used to be.
[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:46.380]  I would love to do three rounds,
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:48.380]  MMA with him, however he wants it.
[02:36:48.380 --> 02:36:49.380]  We can wear gloves.
[02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:54.380]  And I would donate $200,000 a charity
[02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:56.380]  of his choice if he'd do it.
[02:36:56.380 --> 02:36:58.380]  The event would raise $100 million,
[02:36:58.380 --> 02:36:59.380]  probably on pay-per-view,
[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:00.380]  $100 million.
[02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:01.380]  He wants to work for Soros.
[02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:02.380]  He wants to work for the globalists.
[02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:04.380]  But yes, I challenge,
[02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:05.380]  how do you say his name?
[02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:06.380]  I can never say it right.
[02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:07.380]  I don't even know.
[02:37:07.380 --> 02:37:10.380]  I just know that you guard the ogre,
[02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:11.380]  the last part, ogre.
[02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:13.380]  You just know to sink the ogre.
[02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:15.380]  And then the other one's called Harpy,
[02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:17.380]  red-lipped Harpy.
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:20.380]  And so I challenge them to a pay-per-view event,
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:22.380]  first a two-hour debate,
[02:37:22.380 --> 02:37:24.380]  and then a three-round,
[02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:25.380]  if he wants to go bare knuckles,
[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:26.380]  we could, you know,
[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:28.380]  go to some state where it's legal.
[02:37:28.380 --> 02:37:30.380]  I'd really actually like to do that better.
[02:37:30.380 --> 02:37:31.380]  Who knows?
[02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:32.380]  He might be a good boxer.
[02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:33.380]  He might beat me if the gloves are out.
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:35.380]  He's not going to win if there's no gloves.
[02:37:35.380 --> 02:37:38.380]  I'd love to do it, believe me.
[02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:40.380]  So we'll see.
[02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:42.380]  We'll see if the turk can take on the Texan.
[02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:44.380]  That's a great idea, Adam.
[02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:45.380]  We love you.
[02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:47.380]  I had one of a Jones threatens to beat
[02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:51.380]  the wonderful young turk up.
[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:53.380]  No, I said I'd get in the ring
[02:37:53.380 --> 02:38:02.380]  if it was what I said.
[02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:04.380]  If you want to know the spirit
[02:38:04.380 --> 02:38:06.380]  that dominates the UK, Europe,
[02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:08.380]  and the United States,
[02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:10.380]  Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
[02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:11.380]  to a great extent,
[02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:13.380]  it's a spirit of conformity,
[02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:15.380]  a spirit of cowardice,
[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:16.380]  a spirit of being bullied
[02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:19.380]  by the political correct gods.
[02:38:19.380 --> 02:38:21.380]  So when we talk about real doctor evil here,
[02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:23.380]  ladies and gentlemen, that's him.
[02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:25.380]  Hillary is his minion,
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:27.380]  and what he does, and his family,
[02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:29.380]  and his son, the documents came out
[02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:30.380]  where they're funding antifa
[02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:32.380]  to engage in violent riots.
[02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:34.380]  Criminal activity, how they work
[02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:37.380]  with blue state police, blue city police,
[02:38:37.380 --> 02:38:39.380]  blue state areas to then let them
[02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:41.380]  attack and burn and corral crowds
[02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:43.380]  into them so they can attack them.
[02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:45.380]  Those documents came out, what,
[02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:47.380]  three months ago, no news coverage of it.
[02:38:47.380 --> 02:38:48.380]  Just like five years ago,
[02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:50.380]  we broke the Stingray documents
[02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:52.380]  nationwide from DC to Washington state
[02:38:52.380 --> 02:38:53.380]  and exactly how they work,
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:55.380]  but AP, they're saying,
[02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:56.380]  might get a Pulitzer Prize
[02:38:56.380 --> 02:39:00.380]  for their report about it two days ago.
[02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:02.380]  So let's go ahead now and play
[02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:05.380]  the clip that Soros doesn't want you to hear.
[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:08.380]  He thought he would just somehow sell us on this idea,
[02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:10.380]  and then you've got the young turds
[02:39:10.380 --> 02:39:12.380]  and you've got Anderson Cooper
[02:39:12.380 --> 02:39:14.380]  following behind him like he's a dog
[02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:15.380]  going to the bathroom on the sidewalk,
[02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:16.380]  trying to pick it up for him.
[02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:17.380]  Here it is.
[02:39:17.380 --> 02:39:19.380]  My understanding is that you went out
[02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:21.380]  with this protector of yours
[02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:25.380]  who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[02:39:25.380 --> 02:39:26.380]  Yes, yes.
[02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:28.380]  Went out, in fact, and helped him
[02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:30.380]  the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:31.380]  That's right.
[02:39:31.380 --> 02:39:32.380]  Yes.
[02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:34.380]  Was it difficult?
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:38.380]  Not at all, not at all.
[02:39:38.380 --> 02:39:43.380]  Maybe as a child, you don't see the connection,
[02:39:43.380 --> 02:39:48.380]  but it created no problem at all.
[02:39:48.380 --> 02:39:49.380]  No feeling of guilt?
[02:39:49.380 --> 02:39:50.380]  No.
[02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:53.380]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life,
[02:39:53.380 --> 02:39:56.380]  that year of German occupation.
[02:39:56.380 --> 02:39:58.380]  For me, it was a very positive experience.
[02:39:58.380 --> 02:40:00.380]  It's a strange thing,
[02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:03.380]  because you see incredible suffering around you,
[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:08.380]  and in fact you are in considerable danger yourself.
[02:40:08.380 --> 02:40:11.380]  But you're 14 years old and you don't believe
[02:40:11.380 --> 02:40:13.380]  that it can actually touch you.
[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:15.380]  You have a belief in yourself,
[02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:17.380]  your belief in your father.
[02:40:17.380 --> 02:40:21.380]  It's a very happy-making, exhilarating experience.
[02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:23.380]  George Soros is one of those people
[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:26.380]  that actually helps back these individuals.
[02:40:26.380 --> 02:40:27.380]  Who is he?
[02:40:27.380 --> 02:40:29.380]  I think he's from Hungary.
[02:40:29.380 --> 02:40:30.380]  I think he was Jewish,
[02:40:30.380 --> 02:40:32.380]  and I think he turned in his own people to the Nazis.
[02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:35.380]  Do you think George Soros funded the neo-Nazis
[02:40:35.380 --> 02:40:37.380]  who marched in Chelsea?
[02:40:37.380 --> 02:40:38.380]  Wouldn't it be interesting to find out?
[02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:40.380]  These conspiracy theories were first spread
[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:42.380]  by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:40:42.380 --> 02:40:46.380]  The idea also that the way that congressman is saying is like,
[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:49.380]  well, we're learning this, or we're finding this out,
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:51.380]  as if it's sort of the full weight of his office
[02:40:51.380 --> 02:40:52.380]  or the U.S. Congress,
[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:56.380]  when in fact it seems like he's just getting stuff from Alex Jones.
[02:40:56.380 --> 02:41:00.380]  That seems to be where the news is coming from Alex Jones,
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:03.380]  claims to have sources all throughout the government,
[02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:06.380]  but George Soros did not fund these people.
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:08.380]  What he's saying is not true.
[02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:09.380]  He's deeply anti-Semitic.
[02:41:09.380 --> 02:41:11.380]  Now, why do I say that?
[02:41:11.380 --> 02:41:12.380]  For a number of reasons,
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:15.380]  he has attacked George Soros over and over again
[02:41:15.380 --> 02:41:18.380]  with references to his background.
[02:41:18.380 --> 02:41:21.380]  He attacked Michael Wolf who wrote the book about Donald Trump.
[02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:23.380]  They both happened to be Jewish.
[02:41:23.380 --> 02:41:26.380]  He, where you'll see it in a second as well,
[02:41:26.380 --> 02:41:29.380]  says that Soros worked with the Nazis.
[02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:31.380]  It's just like to say someone who,
[02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:34.380]  I don't know if you know that Soros survived the Holocaust.
[02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:36.380]  Alex Jones, the worst guy on earth.
[02:41:36.380 --> 02:41:39.380]  He called George Soros a Nazi collaborator.
[02:41:39.380 --> 02:41:41.380]  Of course that's not true.
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:42.380]  Of course he's done it.
[02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:44.380]  And Soros was a kid at the time.
[02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:46.380]  The guy survives the Holocaust.
[02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:50.380]  And this clown,
[02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:52.380]  and I'm trying not to use worse words against him,
[02:41:52.380 --> 02:41:54.380]  but he is more than earned it,
[02:41:54.380 --> 02:41:57.380]  then turns around and calls a Holocaust survivor
[02:41:57.380 --> 02:41:59.380]  and Nazi collaborator.
[02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:02.380]  And you're named your organization off the young Turks,
[02:42:02.380 --> 02:42:05.380]  who were the brown Turks that carried out the extermination
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:07.380]  of a million and a half Christians,
[02:42:07.380 --> 02:42:09.380]  and your program is anti-Christian.
[02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:10.380]  We get it.
[02:42:10.380 --> 02:42:11.380]  That's what the globalists are all about.
[02:42:11.380 --> 02:42:13.380]  Hating flyover country.
[02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:15.380]  They hate me because I'm Americana.
[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:17.380]  They hate you because you're Americana.
[02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:18.380]  That's it.
[02:42:18.380 --> 02:42:19.380]  They hate us, except it.
[02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:20.380]  Know it.
[02:42:20.380 --> 02:42:21.380]  He wrote a book.
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:22.380]  His dad wrote a book.
[02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:24.380]  They helped round up for years.
[02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:25.380]  Over a thousand Jews
[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:28.380]  and steal their money with the Nazis.
[02:42:28.380 --> 02:42:30.380]  It's well known the Nazis would recruit Jews
[02:42:30.380 --> 02:42:32.380]  that would work with them to help round people up.
[02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:33.380]  That's a fact.
[02:42:33.380 --> 02:42:34.380]  Poland talked about that,
[02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:36.380]  and Netanyahu flipped out on them.
[02:42:36.380 --> 02:42:37.380]  I'm not against Netanyahu,
[02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:40.380]  but Netanyahu gets your history straight.
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:41.380]  Poland is right.
[02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:43.380]  There are a lot of people like Soros
[02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:44.380]  that help round up other Jews.
[02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:46.380]  They're called Judas Goats.
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:49.380]  There's two recorded reports of Alex Jones.
[02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:50.380]  We will be right back on the other side
[02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:51.380]  with more Alex Jones show.
[02:42:51.380 --> 02:42:52.380]  I am filling in.
[02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:53.380]  My name is Jake Lloyd,
[02:42:53.380 --> 02:42:55.380]  your host for the rest of the hour.
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:57.380]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough
[02:42:57.380 --> 02:42:58.380]  in modern medicine,
[02:42:58.380 --> 02:43:00.380]  introducing pollen block.
[02:43:00.380 --> 02:43:02.380]  We have found an extraordinary,
[02:43:02.380 --> 02:43:04.380]  new, natural way to alleviate
[02:43:04.380 --> 02:43:05.380]  seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:07.380]  including promoting clear nasal
[02:43:07.380 --> 02:43:09.380]  and sinus passageways,
[02:43:09.380 --> 02:43:12.380]  eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:43:12.380 --> 02:43:15.380]  In the 1960s, researchers in France
[02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:17.380]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:19.380]  experienced less seasonal immune
[02:43:19.380 --> 02:43:21.380]  and inflammatory responses.
[02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:23.380]  They began studying this effect
[02:43:23.380 --> 02:43:24.380]  in published trials,
[02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:25.380]  and decades later,
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:27.380]  we now have the fruit of this research,
[02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:29.380]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:32.380]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:35.380]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:36.380]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:38.380]  In fact, current research has found
[02:43:38.380 --> 02:43:40.380]  that it actually acts by blocking
[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:41.380]  the activity of triptase,
[02:43:41.380 --> 02:43:43.380]  which is an enzyme that amplifies
[02:43:43.380 --> 02:43:45.380]  immune and inflammatory responses
[02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:46.380]  in the body.
[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:49.380]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:51.380]  Head to infowarslife.com
[02:43:51.380 --> 02:43:53.380]  and grab a pack of our pollen block
[02:43:53.380 --> 02:43:54.380]  chewable tablets.
[02:43:54.380 --> 02:43:57.380]  Get ready for Alex Jones to invade the swamp.
[02:43:57.380 --> 02:43:59.380]  Jones is set to give a speech
[02:43:59.380 --> 02:44:02.380]  at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
[02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:03.380]  on April 10th,
[02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:04.380]  during which he'll make a statement
[02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:07.380]  on the raft of anti-free speech lawsuits
[02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:09.380]  targeting his First Amendment rights.
[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:11.380]  Numerous lawsuits have been launched
[02:44:11.380 --> 02:44:13.380]  on the premise of attracting media attention
[02:44:13.380 --> 02:44:15.380]  and defaming Alex Jones
[02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:17.380]  and Infowars' reputation.
[02:44:17.380 --> 02:44:19.380]  Jones will address the left's new tactic
[02:44:19.380 --> 02:44:21.380]  of trying to bury Infowars
[02:44:21.380 --> 02:44:23.380]  under a deluge of lawsuits,
[02:44:23.380 --> 02:44:26.380]  several of which do not rest on any sound legal basis.
[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:29.380]  While the mainstream media and many on the left
[02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:31.380]  routinely celebrate these lawsuits
[02:44:31.380 --> 02:44:32.380]  when they're first filed,
[02:44:32.380 --> 02:44:34.380]  those same people are noticeably silent
[02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:36.380]  when the lawsuits collapse.
[02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:38.380]  These lawsuits are yet another attempt
[02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:40.380]  to shut down free speech,
[02:44:40.380 --> 02:44:42.380]  and they are doomed to fail.
[02:44:42.380 --> 02:44:44.380]  Alex Jones will go live at 9 a.m. Eastern
[02:44:44.380 --> 02:44:47.380]  from the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:50.380]  You can find live streams of the press conference
[02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:52.380]  at infowars.com.
[02:44:52.380 --> 02:44:55.380]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo, Infowars.com.
[02:44:55.380 --> 02:44:58.380]  Infowars Life Brain Force Plus
[02:44:58.380 --> 02:45:00.380]  is our number one selling product
[02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:02.380]  by leaps and bounds, and for a good reason.
[02:45:02.380 --> 02:45:03.380]  Going back about five years ago,
[02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:05.380]  we did research on what top-selling
[02:45:05.380 --> 02:45:07.380]  new tropics were, what were most popular,
[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:09.380]  what were best, what people liked,
[02:45:09.380 --> 02:45:11.380]  and we made it even stronger.
[02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:13.380]  Then we cut the price, because leading competitors
[02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:15.380]  have five to seven times markup.
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:17.380]  We only have 150%,
[02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:19.380]  and then it helps fund our operation.
[02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:22.380]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:25.380]  That means we've got a 25% markup,
[02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:28.380]  and we've got it paired with the real red pill
[02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:30.380]  that takes about seven days to kick in.
[02:45:30.380 --> 02:45:32.380]  Brain Force takes about 30 minutes,
[02:45:32.380 --> 02:45:34.380]  but the two go together.
[02:45:34.380 --> 02:45:36.380]  The mind and body challenge,
[02:45:36.380 --> 02:45:39.380]  they're both 50% off individually,
[02:45:39.380 --> 02:45:41.380]  or together they're 50% off,
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:44.380]  and free shipping with the combo
[02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:46.380]  at infowarslife.com.
[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:48.380]  But it's got to end in a couple days,
[02:45:48.380 --> 02:45:50.380]  because both of these bestsellers
[02:45:50.380 --> 02:45:52.380]  are about to sell out.
[02:45:52.380 --> 02:45:54.380]  Infowarslife.com to get your Brain Force Plus
[02:45:54.380 --> 02:45:56.380]  and real red pill today.
[02:45:56.380 --> 02:45:58.380]  After being sold out for months,
[02:45:58.380 --> 02:46:00.380]  our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste
[02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:02.380]  is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:02.380 --> 02:46:04.380]  Super blue sold out in one week.
[02:46:04.380 --> 02:46:06.380]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:08.380]  And since then, people are beating down our doors,
[02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:10.380]  wanting to be able to resupply their super blue.
[02:46:10.380 --> 02:46:12.380]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:14.380]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:46:14.380 --> 02:46:16.380]  When bacteria infect your gums,
[02:46:16.380 --> 02:46:18.380]  it can enter your bloodstream,
[02:46:18.380 --> 02:46:20.380]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:22.380]  That's why the Last Surgeon Generals report
[02:46:22.380 --> 02:46:24.380]  on oral health warns that your oral health
[02:46:24.380 --> 02:46:26.380]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:46:26.380 --> 02:46:28.380]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste
[02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:30.380]  is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:32.380]  It's a new formula that helps you
[02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:34.380]  to remove the bad halogen iodine
[02:46:34.380 --> 02:46:36.380]  so the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:46:36.380 --> 02:46:38.380]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients
[02:46:38.380 --> 02:46:40.380]  used in biblical times
[02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:42.380]  to help wipe out bad bacteria
[02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:44.380]  and eliminate bad breath.
[02:46:44.380 --> 02:46:46.380]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue
[02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:48.380]  chosen by our dental experts include
[02:46:48.380 --> 02:46:50.380]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[02:46:58.380 --> 02:47:02.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:26.420]  Welcome back, everybody.
[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:29.620]  Everybody, my name is Jake Lloyd, your host filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:32.020]  He's out today in the previous segment.
[02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:37.620]  You saw two reports from him talking about the young Turks and their allegations of anti-Semitism
[02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:42.980]  just for criticizing a couple people who happen to be Jewish.
[02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:47.100]  It's very telling that, well, Alex has not said anything about there being Jewish.
[02:47:47.100 --> 02:47:52.980]  It's weird how a racist group like the young Turks would be the ones to point out the fact
[02:47:52.980 --> 02:47:54.740]  that they're Jewish.
[02:47:54.740 --> 02:47:55.740]  It's very telling.
[02:47:55.740 --> 02:48:01.020]  Now, we're about to go to a report again here in a few minutes talking about immigration
[02:48:01.020 --> 02:48:02.900]  and other such issues.
[02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:09.100]  I don't know if this is credible, so I can't speak to the validity of this, but on Twitter,
[02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:15.140]  it looks like the migrant caravan has not been completely disbanded by Mexico.
[02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:22.540]  It says that they've just received in Puebla, Mexico, received hardly by news crews, first
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:26.380]  aid trucks, food, water, state reps for the commission of human rights.
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:27.980]  So we don't know if that's true.
[02:48:27.980 --> 02:48:31.180]  Mexico said that they're going to disband the caravan.
[02:48:31.180 --> 02:48:33.420]  We don't know if they actually will or not.
[02:48:33.420 --> 02:48:34.540]  They don't seem to care.
[02:48:34.540 --> 02:48:41.780]  It's interesting how Mexico is totally complicit in the invasion of America by Mexican nationals.
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:45.740]  So now we are going to another clip from Alex Jones talking about immigration.
[02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:53.860]  Well, the videos are up on infowars.com, both of them, a Republican senator has come out
[02:48:53.860 --> 02:48:55.260]  and said that Trump is nuts.
[02:48:55.260 --> 02:48:57.500]  We're going to give that a moment.
[02:48:57.500 --> 02:49:03.060]  Also, Bill O'Reilly has now written an article and shot a video and exposed the fact that
[02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:08.500]  David Hogg is funded by known sorrow script, something we broke two days after the shooting
[02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:09.500]  on February 16th.
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:10.500]  That happened on February 14th.
[02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:12.740]  I'm going to give that a moment.
[02:49:12.740 --> 02:49:16.940]  And Hogg has flipped out now and basically demanded that he be de-platformed, like Laura
[02:49:16.940 --> 02:49:19.740]  Ingram needs to be de-platformed.
[02:49:19.740 --> 02:49:23.820]  The problem is Hogg, he's already been de-platformed and some will say, well, he might have sexually
[02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:24.820]  harassed women or whatever.
[02:49:24.820 --> 02:49:25.820]  I'm not defending Bill O'Reilly.
[02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:29.220]  I don't like him personally, but I like some of his politics and his information.
[02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:32.500]  He's not a Nazi collaborator like George Soros is the point.
[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:35.140]  And George Soros is the main funder of the Women's March.
[02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:39.700]  The day after the shooting on February 15th, it was in the news that the Women's March
[02:49:39.700 --> 02:49:43.820]  had decided to help with their funding and organization, with planes, with buses, with
[02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:46.500]  money, with Democrat coordinators.
[02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:49.660]  And it was the same production we saw a year ago, the day after the inauguration that we
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:53.980]  saw at the march for the destruction of the Second Amendment or the march for our lives,
[02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:55.480]  as it's called.
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:49:59.100]  So that's the reality of what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:02.780]  And I just went for a little hike here, about to go back in the house and get ready for
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:07.580]  the show today with Paul Watson, myself, Ted Dujans, going to be on it so much more today.
[02:50:07.580 --> 02:50:12.540]  And again, that's 11 to 3 p.m. central in fullwords.com forward slash show.
[02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:16.300]  But getting back to the fact that you've got this Republican senator and others coming
[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:18.940]  out saying the president's nuts for what he's doing with China.
[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:24.340]  China has a $900 billion trade deficit with us, $500 billion in cash, $300 billion very,
[02:50:24.340 --> 02:50:30.100]  very, very conservatively in tariffs and trade and other issues, another $100 billion in
[02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:31.380]  other security issues.
[02:50:31.380 --> 02:50:35.700]  Let's just say it's $600, $700 billion, $900 billion is at the tops.
[02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:40.740]  Some comes out with a $50 billion tariff on them, and then they put even more tariffs
[02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:41.740]  on us.
[02:50:41.740 --> 02:50:43.460]  They have internal tariffs on our goods.
[02:50:43.460 --> 02:50:44.780]  They are screwing us over.
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:46.900]  They've been screwing us over.
[02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:48.220]  This is globalism.
[02:50:48.220 --> 02:50:51.380]  We lost the trade war a long time ago because our government surrendered.
[02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:52.460]  It capitulated.
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:55.460]  Like Vice President Pence has said, that's the truth.
[02:50:55.460 --> 02:50:58.460]  And now you've got all these globalists that wanted to teach America a lesson.
[02:50:58.460 --> 02:51:03.700]  Bring flower country to heal, deindustrialize the country to politically control us.
[02:51:03.700 --> 02:51:04.900]  And that's what they've done.
[02:51:04.900 --> 02:51:08.020]  They wanted us to be top-heavy, only military.
[02:51:08.020 --> 02:51:09.020]  That's globalism.
[02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:12.940]  And then let China be military and industrial and end up being the Chinese century as the
[02:51:12.940 --> 02:51:15.140]  CFR and other traders say.
[02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:19.260]  So Trump would be nuts for not standing up for this country and not doing all the basic
[02:51:19.260 --> 02:51:22.420]  things he's done, like pulling us out of the TPP, the transfer all our power to these
[02:51:22.420 --> 02:51:23.420]  unelected groups.
[02:51:23.420 --> 02:51:27.420]  Remember when liberals used to be against things like the TPP and NAFTA and GATT and
[02:51:27.420 --> 02:51:32.020]  the IMF and the World Bank and the World Trade Organization, the transfer and power overseas?
[02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:36.620]  But the peace movement got smashed in 1999 when Bill Clinton used the military and others
[02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:39.940]  in Seattle to stage riots to then blame the peaceful protesters.
[02:51:39.940 --> 02:51:40.940]  I made a film.
[02:51:40.940 --> 02:51:42.260]  I'll police say to the takeover.
[02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:43.380]  Go watch it.
[02:51:43.380 --> 02:51:48.620]  See how the antifone, that's what was called then, was brought in, trained in Oregon, brought
[02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:53.780]  in, the Delta Force ran them and had them break out windows to then demonize and blame
[02:51:53.780 --> 02:51:56.740]  the 100,000 peaceful protesters who were then attacked.
[02:51:56.740 --> 02:52:02.620]  I had Esquire interviewing me a few years ago, a famous guy, a famous biographer, famous
[02:52:02.620 --> 02:52:07.580]  author, Richardson, and his father, of course, the CIA section chief, famously in Vietnam.
[02:52:07.580 --> 02:52:10.020]  He didn't believe me about the Delta Force.
[02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:12.940]  He never heard about it until he went and looked up the Seattle Post intelligence and
[02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:14.820]  everything and saw the videos I shot.
[02:52:14.820 --> 02:52:17.300]  I know this stuff sounds freaking crazy, okay?
[02:52:17.300 --> 02:52:18.300]  It's the truth.
[02:52:18.300 --> 02:52:21.540]  Now, I knew about it from people in the Army at the time.
[02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:22.860]  So I've got my sources.
[02:52:22.860 --> 02:52:24.300]  The globalists can't stand it.
[02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:28.380]  By the way, CNN just attacked Trump last night and said, he's crazy, just like the senator
[02:52:28.380 --> 02:52:29.380]  said.
[02:52:29.380 --> 02:52:30.380]  He gets his news from Alex Jones.
[02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:34.900]  Only Alex Jones is saying that women making the trek up via coyotes, smugglers into the
[02:52:34.900 --> 02:52:37.300]  U.S. out of Mexico get raped.
[02:52:37.300 --> 02:52:39.820]  That is the U.N. and the State Department's own numbers.
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:43.860]  The Huffington Post and AP broke that three years ago.
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:47.300]  So Trump talks about how 80% of the women get raped, just like he said, women are getting
[02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:51.140]  raped in Sweden, and they go, you're crazy, nobody's raping women.
[02:52:51.140 --> 02:52:55.020]  So when Muslims are doing it or Hispanic counties are doing it to women, smugglers,
[02:52:55.020 --> 02:52:56.020]  it doesn't exist.
[02:52:56.020 --> 02:52:59.300]  But then all males in America are rapists, according to feminists.
[02:52:59.300 --> 02:53:04.260]  So it's just the way the left defends all these corrupt things that are happening, and
[02:53:04.260 --> 02:53:05.260]  it's just sick.
[02:53:05.260 --> 02:53:10.460]  Now, getting back to David Hogg, it is a fact that weeks after I broke all this, just look
[02:53:10.460 --> 02:53:13.900]  at the names of the groups who funded him and who was funding Hogg, they took those
[02:53:13.900 --> 02:53:14.900]  four students.
[02:53:14.900 --> 02:53:16.020]  They weren't crisis actors.
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:18.860]  They were picked because they were anti-gun to be the little PR stars.
[02:53:18.860 --> 02:53:22.380]  They were picked out of the drama department because their parents were anti-gun, and they
[02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:25.460]  were good to go and had the message and had feet on the ground.
[02:53:25.460 --> 02:53:26.980]  And that's what the globalists did.
[02:53:26.980 --> 02:53:27.980]  That's what unfolded.
[02:53:27.980 --> 02:53:28.980]  That's the reality.
[02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:32.740]  So I'm right about Soros funding the march to destroy the Second Amendment.
[02:53:32.740 --> 02:53:35.660]  I'm right that they want to repeal the Second Amendment, they now admit it.
[02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:36.660]  Trump is right about all that.
[02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:40.140]  Trump is right about what's happening with these people and how the massive rapes and
[02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:43.980]  murders and abuse that happened to people coming up through Mexico and Latin America
[02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:48.220]  into the U.S., not by Don Johnson shooting pregnant Hispanic ladies like the fiction
[02:53:48.220 --> 02:53:53.980]  movie that came out a few years ago, where all the white people are racist and all this
[02:53:53.980 --> 02:53:54.980]  stuff.
[02:53:54.980 --> 02:53:55.980]  No.
[02:53:55.980 --> 02:53:56.980]  What was that stupid movie?
[02:53:56.980 --> 02:53:57.980]  Machete.
[02:53:57.980 --> 02:54:01.500]  The reality is hundreds of thousands of Mexicans are dead the last decade we know of.
[02:54:01.500 --> 02:54:04.660]  They estimate there's hundreds of thousands buried in the desert in Mexico of people that
[02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:08.220]  didn't have enough money to come across or didn't have money from the shakedown who
[02:54:08.220 --> 02:54:10.100]  got raped or killed.
[02:54:10.100 --> 02:54:14.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality, and CNN's job is destroying reality.
[02:54:14.940 --> 02:54:19.900]  CNN's job is taking admitted fact and then saying it's insane and then saying, look,
[02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:22.300]  Jones claims Soros is a Nazi collaborator.
[02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:23.300]  This came from Jones.
[02:54:23.300 --> 02:54:29.420]  No, it came out of Soros' mouth in 60 minutes, or Jones says that there are, you know, massive
[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:33.260]  amounts of people being killed and raped coming out of Mexico by the Mexican drug gangs and
[02:54:33.260 --> 02:54:34.260]  the smugglers.
[02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:38.180]  Total admitted fact, university studies, you name it, fed the professors on.
[02:54:38.180 --> 02:54:42.380]  We have trailblaze exposing this for over two decades, but this is now mainstream news.
[02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:46.500]  And then again, the fact that China has one-sided deals screwing us over with globalist traders
[02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:48.820]  in our country, they get paid off to do it.
[02:54:48.820 --> 02:54:52.660]  They move our companies over there, they nationalize them, and then the U.S. companies are tax-exempt
[02:54:52.660 --> 02:54:56.780]  for these globalists to live like kings while they lecture us to raise taxes on Americans
[02:54:56.780 --> 02:54:58.380]  and pose as liberals.
[02:54:58.380 --> 02:55:03.140]  Amazon, Google, Facebook, all you people, your reign of terror over America is over.
[02:55:03.140 --> 02:55:08.660]  The surrender is over, ladies and gentlemen, infowars.com, newswars.com, Paul Watson is
[02:55:08.660 --> 02:55:12.540]  hosting part of the broadcast today, Ted Nugent, so much more.
[02:55:12.540 --> 02:55:13.540]  Remember, you're part of the rebellion.
[02:55:13.540 --> 02:55:17.060]  When you spread these links, these videos, these articles, you override their bots, you
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:19.580]  override their AI, you override their censorship.
[02:55:19.580 --> 02:55:24.180]  When you talk to people in person and talk about infowars.com, you change the world.
[02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:27.100]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, back to the live transmission.
[02:55:27.100 --> 02:55:31.660]  David Knight on in the morning doing a great job, 8 to 11, 6, we're up to 10 hours live
[02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:36.660]  a day, adding more, want to be 20 hours a day by the end of 2018, so I got to get cooking.
[02:55:36.660 --> 02:55:40.060]  I appreciate you all, Pat Riley, want to make any comments about all this garbage?
[02:55:40.060 --> 02:55:41.660]  Keep America free and great again.
[02:55:41.660 --> 02:55:45.420]  And what do you make of them calling him crazy, saying Mexican women get rape coming up through
[02:55:45.420 --> 02:55:48.900]  Mexico when it's all over the news, or saying he's crazy that people are getting their heads
[02:55:48.900 --> 02:55:53.420]  chopped off, or him saying it's crazy that China has one sided trade deals with us, or
[02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:57.420]  you know, saying that he's crazy that Muslims are raping people in Sweden, or saying that
[02:55:57.420 --> 02:55:59.540]  I'm crazy that George Soros is a Nazi collaborator.
[02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:02.340]  The truth's crazy, you know, the truth's crazy.
[02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:04.220]  Sometimes crazy happens and it's crazy.
[02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:08.140]  Got to believe that, got to believe that on the show, but that's a good quote, the truth
[02:56:08.140 --> 02:56:09.140]  is crazy.
[02:56:09.140 --> 02:56:10.140]  The truth is crazy.
[02:56:10.140 --> 02:56:12.540]  I mean, we're standing on grass, it's green, somebody's going to say it's not green and
[02:56:12.540 --> 02:56:13.540]  we're not standing on grass.
[02:56:13.540 --> 02:56:14.540]  We're not on the green screen.
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:18.740]  CNN, CNN, that is not green grass, that is not a tree, that is not clouds, this is not
[02:56:18.740 --> 02:56:19.740]  planet Earth.
[02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:22.620]  And I'm not a real human, and I don't pay real taxes.
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:26.260]  But they just gas like their audience, how do people tune into that and go, God, Trump's
[02:56:26.260 --> 02:56:29.380]  crazy, he claims Mexico's abusing people.
[02:56:29.380 --> 02:56:33.380]  I just, I think people need to open their eyes and you know, listen to what's being
[02:56:33.380 --> 02:56:37.380]  said and presented and take account for other people's actions.
[02:56:37.380 --> 02:56:38.380]  Incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:38.380 --> 02:56:40.460]  Well, that's it for this live transmission.
[02:56:40.460 --> 02:56:43.780]  Again, more at infowars.com, they're trying to take us down because they know where the
[02:56:43.780 --> 02:56:44.780]  tip of the spear.
[02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:49.020]  I salute you all, Sunday, Shokin' Up to Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. as well, and then I'll be hosting
[02:56:49.020 --> 02:56:54.340]  the show from D.C. with Owen Schreuer, back at the Central Texas Command Center Monday,
[02:56:54.340 --> 02:56:58.100]  Tuesday and Wednesday at the big press conference coming up at the National Press Club.
[02:56:58.100 --> 02:57:00.860]  On Tuesday, there's already folks trying to shut that down and already trying to have
[02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:02.940]  the National Press Club not let us be there.
[02:57:02.940 --> 02:57:06.980]  But the press club said, you know, just don't use our logo, which everybody else does and
[02:57:06.980 --> 02:57:10.860]  the contract doesn't say it, and we're going to maybe let you still have speech, see, because
[02:57:10.860 --> 02:57:14.300]  America's so free, you can't let Alex Jones be at the National Press Club and respond
[02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:15.700]  to all these fake lawsuits.
[02:57:15.700 --> 02:57:19.780]  And the counter suits, we are preparing, and my lawyers will be there, so you'll want
[02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:20.780]  to be there Tuesday.
[02:57:20.780 --> 02:57:23.140]  Everybody should call C-SPAN, tell them to come cover it.
[02:57:23.140 --> 02:57:24.220]  This is real news.
[02:57:24.220 --> 02:57:27.460]  Find out why we're the most feared news organization in the world by tyrants.
[02:57:27.460 --> 02:57:28.460]  Find out today.
[02:57:28.460 --> 02:57:29.460]  Defend the Republic.
[02:57:29.460 --> 02:57:30.460]  Awaken humanity.
[02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:34.620]  We will win, God bless you all, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:34.620 --> 02:57:45.300]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:48.020]  Mike in Arizona here on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:50.540]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:57:50.540 --> 02:57:54.220]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[02:57:54.220 --> 02:58:00.420]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:58:00.420 --> 02:58:06.380]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce
[02:58:06.380 --> 02:58:07.380]  Anthroplex.
[02:58:07.380 --> 02:58:09.700]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[02:58:09.700 --> 02:58:10.700]  Thank you.
[02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:14.780]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[02:58:14.780 --> 02:58:15.780]  toothpaste fans.
[02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:17.620]  The Super Blue is awesome.
[02:58:17.620 --> 02:58:20.540]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:58:20.540 --> 02:58:21.740]  They are quality.
[02:58:21.740 --> 02:58:23.660]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:58:23.660 --> 02:58:26.580]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:58:26.580 --> 02:58:27.580]  Absolutely.
[02:58:27.580 --> 02:58:32.700]  And because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[02:58:32.700 --> 02:58:37.620]  understand that there's a bigger problem going on and if we can get our houses in order
[02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:46.220]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:58:46.220 --> 02:59:08.180]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy and healthy.
[02:59:08.180 --> 02:59:16.180]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy and healthy.
[02:59:16.180 --> 02:59:45.420]  Thank you so much.
[02:59:46.180 --> 02:59:59.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:59.820 --> 03:00:03.780]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:03.780 --> 03:00:05.780]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.780 --> 03:00:15.920]  You can run-on for a long time, run-on for a long time, run-on for a long time sooner
[03:00:15.920 --> 03:00:21.180]  or later gotta cut you down, sooner or later gotta cut you-
[03:00:21.180 --> 03:00:24.180]  Headline CNN Republican Senators called Trump nuts on China.
[03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:28.460]  Yea they got a $900 billion deficit with us, if you argue maybe 700 billion is the lowest
[03:00:28.460 --> 03:00:29.460]  end.
[03:00:29.460 --> 03:00:35.100]  He does a $50 billion trade take on them and they flip out because we rich 4d corporate
[03:00:35.100 --> 03:00:39.020]  corporate tax, they were at 15. We went to 15 to match it. That's a tariff. When they
[03:00:39.020 --> 03:00:46.660]  had a much lower corporate tax, those people base there. They went to zero. The communists
[03:00:46.660 --> 03:00:54.660]  had the corporate bosses pay zero. Now you know why Bezos and all the rest of them are
[03:00:54.660 --> 03:00:59.100]  China files. You know why they're basing themselves there. You know why Warren Buffett and all
[03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:05.100]  these people, because they pay zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. They're offshore people.
[03:01:05.100 --> 03:01:08.700]  And the left's like screw you. We're not going to cut taxes on the middle class. You'll never
[03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:12.300]  bring America back. And the white blank find it Goldman Sachs. You'll never bring the country
[03:01:12.300 --> 03:01:16.260]  back to the infrastructure tweeting at Trump. You people, they had to hire people that hated
[03:01:16.260 --> 03:01:20.860]  America because the globalists are conquering the country. And you can't hire more moral
[03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:23.980]  people to undermine a nation, sell it out economically, culturally. You've got to hire
[03:01:23.980 --> 03:01:29.180]  scum and dumbasses and fools that have an existential envy of strength and honor and
[03:01:29.180 --> 03:01:34.220]  will and productivity. And what is the chivalrous archetype of the West? And so you have to
[03:01:34.220 --> 03:01:41.300]  pull down that Arthurian or that Roland archetype, the French ethos, you know, the Iliad, the
[03:01:41.300 --> 03:01:49.300]  Greek ethos. You have to pull down that ethos because it threatens you. The ethos of 300
[03:01:49.300 --> 03:01:54.700]  in Sparta. You have to pull it down. You have to celebrate weakness, celebrate the soy boys,
[03:01:54.700 --> 03:01:58.020]  celebrate the beta so that when people who are slaves have been made beta chemically
[03:01:58.020 --> 03:02:00.780]  and culturally by mom and the wouldn't let them ride their bike outside because they
[03:02:00.780 --> 03:02:03.900]  live in a high rise building, they've got to take these little poistured brain damaged
[03:02:03.900 --> 03:02:08.420]  people and put them into assault. Those of us that don't want to die, those of us that
[03:02:08.420 --> 03:02:11.820]  still want to have children, those of us that still enjoy life, those of us that don't see
[03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:16.100]  someone else's success as a bad thing. See, you had your simulated victories as I'm sued
[03:02:16.100 --> 03:02:19.860]  and attacked and mind about. We're only getting bigger and stronger. This is what I came to
[03:02:19.860 --> 03:02:24.780]  do is fight you people. I came to show people that there aren't just cowards in this world
[03:02:24.780 --> 03:02:29.060]  and I came to try to get other people to take action and they're listening and they're
[03:02:29.060 --> 03:02:35.860]  getting involved and we're winning. So our era of surrender is over. I am not surrendered
[03:02:35.860 --> 03:02:39.460]  to any of this. Our powerful listeners who are activists of every race, color and creed,
[03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:45.900]  I salute you. We're not giving up and we understand the score and we understand that it's the
[03:02:45.900 --> 03:02:50.260]  globalist and the Antifa and Soros funding them that have been caught staging riots.
[03:02:50.260 --> 03:02:53.340]  We have the documents on the site all over the country. They wanted to create martial
[03:02:53.340 --> 03:02:59.260]  law in 2015 for Obama. All that came out. David Hogg writes about how he wants to seek
[03:02:59.260 --> 03:03:05.820]  billions die. It's the religion of the globalist. It's an anti-human death cult and those that
[03:03:05.820 --> 03:03:10.020]  are in it take their part of the winning team. You're the losers and I'm not just telling
[03:03:10.020 --> 03:03:14.460]  you you're a loser. They use their bots and social media to bot spam libertarians, conservatives,
[03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:18.460]  Christians and make us all feel alone. We know it's fake. We know it's controlled. We
[03:03:18.460 --> 03:03:22.980]  know 95% of its bots. We understand we're just there reaching out transmitting to the few
[03:03:22.980 --> 03:03:26.620]  humans on Facebook and Twitter that we can still reach out to and let them know we're
[03:03:26.620 --> 03:03:30.460]  not giving into the bullying. We understand we're building alternative networks and systems.
[03:03:30.460 --> 03:03:34.580]  We're taking the country back. We're turning the life support of the economy back on. We're
[03:03:34.580 --> 03:03:37.980]  turning the free speech back on where we're battling for the right to self-defense. We're
[03:03:37.980 --> 03:03:41.940]  battling the attempt to repeal the Second Amendment. We're battling the federalization
[03:03:41.940 --> 03:03:45.620]  and the globalization through the World Council of Churches of the takeover of our churches.
[03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:50.220]  We are identifying the enemy cancer and we are standing against it. We are the front
[03:03:50.220 --> 03:03:54.180]  line of the resistance. We're real and we can feel the energy level rising as the enemy
[03:03:54.180 --> 03:03:58.220]  is in its death rows right now. We're not offering some utopia, but this big wave of
[03:03:58.220 --> 03:04:02.140]  the globalists is failing and their whole Battle of the Bold counter-offensive led by
[03:04:02.140 --> 03:04:06.620]  their Zeb Dietrichs of the modern age or Michael Mores and the rest of them are going
[03:04:06.620 --> 03:04:10.340]  to come right in and face us and we are going to defeat them and then the full collapse
[03:04:10.340 --> 03:04:14.500]  is on and already your funding is being cut off, the Saudi funding, the Chinese funding,
[03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:18.620]  it's all being cut off and more of it's going to be cut off because this is World War 4.
[03:04:18.620 --> 03:04:24.100]  It's economic, it's cultural, it's informational and we are the Info War. We were dug in 23
[03:04:24.100 --> 03:04:28.780]  years ago. We have the intel. We have the information. We're dug in and we're on the
[03:04:28.780 --> 03:04:32.380]  offense at the same time and our information spreading and governments and intelligence
[03:04:32.380 --> 03:04:36.100]  agencies across the world are listening because they know the data they're getting is absolutely
[03:04:36.100 --> 03:04:41.460]  historical and on point and victory is in our sales. I salute you all. Now come on in
[03:04:41.460 --> 03:04:54.540]  for the big win.
[03:04:54.540 --> 03:04:58.540]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy. We went
[03:04:58.540 --> 03:05:02.940]  out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy
[03:05:02.940 --> 03:05:08.740]  stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula than some of
[03:05:08.740 --> 03:05:11.860]  the best selling formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and looked at what
[03:05:11.860 --> 03:05:15.380]  is the top, what is the best. We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it better.
[03:05:15.380 --> 03:05:20.700]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60. We put $10 in it and sell
[03:05:20.700 --> 03:05:26.540]  it for $30. It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top of the line new tropic
[03:05:26.540 --> 03:05:32.740]  for $19.95. Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average. We need that $15, $20. We
[03:05:32.740 --> 03:05:36.340]  make to fund this operation in the face of the global, the rest of it. But I'm doing
[03:05:36.340 --> 03:05:40.740]  this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks. I want to shell it all out before
[03:05:40.740 --> 03:05:44.940]  the big supply comes in. And I want people that haven't tried Brainforce to try it and
[03:05:44.940 --> 03:05:51.860]  find out why it's got 6,000 plus five star reviews. It's amazing. Infowarsstore.com, InfowarsLive.com
[03:05:51.860 --> 03:06:10.700]  or AAA-2533139. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex
[03:06:10.700 --> 03:06:19.860]  Jones. And welcome to this edition of Alex, the Infowars.com, Infowars, Alex Jones, Doug
[03:06:19.860 --> 03:06:23.140]  Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones. I'll get it right. Just hang right there. I'll get
[03:06:23.140 --> 03:06:28.340]  it right. Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones. HagmanReport.com. That's my home base,
[03:06:28.340 --> 03:06:34.380]  of course. And I got a lot of information to talk about. By the way, wasn't that film
[03:06:34.380 --> 03:06:39.940]  with Ted Nugent, did you watch that? If not, go back and watch that. To me, that was so
[03:06:39.940 --> 03:06:45.500]  refreshing to see a real American and real Americans talking about the way America needs
[03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:54.420]  to be bringing back America to its roots. And I love Ted Nugent. I love his everything
[03:06:54.420 --> 03:06:59.660]  he stands for. And the fact that he's speaking out, the fact that this documentary was made,
[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:05.100]  that this film was made, the fact that we've got the freedom at this point to do exactly
[03:07:05.100 --> 03:07:12.860]  that. This says a lot. And it says a lot about Infowars.com, Infowars.com, Alex Jones. It
[03:07:12.860 --> 03:07:18.500]  says a lot about where we are headed, but also about the fight that we're in. Because
[03:07:18.500 --> 03:07:25.380]  if it was up to the gatekeepers of information, that would never see the light of day. Ted
[03:07:25.380 --> 03:07:30.660]  Nugent would not be allowed to show his guns. Of course, that's already been decided on
[03:07:30.660 --> 03:07:36.700]  YouTube. You can't do that. You can't show guns. It's already been decided by the people
[03:07:36.700 --> 03:07:46.260]  who are the unallocated arbiters of the media, or at least what you are allowed to see and
[03:07:46.260 --> 03:07:50.420]  what you're not allowed to see. I started my show this morning, early this morning,
[03:07:50.420 --> 03:07:57.100]  The Dukheim Radio Show. And I was thinking about the entire week and thinking about Alex
[03:07:57.100 --> 03:08:03.740]  and thinking about his battle with lawsuits. And our battle, yours and mine, with fake news
[03:08:03.740 --> 03:08:09.700]  and being accused of being purveyors of fake news and being accused of everything from
[03:08:09.700 --> 03:08:16.740]  being racist to working with the Mossad, to working with the Russians. Just take your
[03:08:16.740 --> 03:08:26.020]  pick. To the progressive liberal fascists, we are nothing but the devil incarnate as
[03:08:26.020 --> 03:08:32.380]  opposed to the truth tellers and the truth seekers. So I got to be thinking about that.
[03:08:32.380 --> 03:08:39.620]  And I searched the origin of the phrase fake news. Because if you stop and think about
[03:08:39.620 --> 03:08:43.900]  it, when did it, when all of a sudden did we hear this phrase fake news? When did this
[03:08:43.900 --> 03:08:50.900]  come to pass? When did it become, when was this suddenly inserted into our lexicon, fake
[03:08:50.900 --> 03:08:57.300]  news? Did you think about that? A lot of times people don't. I didn't. I haven't been thinking
[03:08:57.300 --> 03:09:02.980]  about it. And then I did some searching and I found that Cheryl Atkinson, the CBS News
[03:09:02.980 --> 03:09:10.940]  performer, CBS News reporter, who was treated very well, was treated criminally by members
[03:09:10.940 --> 03:09:16.660]  of the intelligence community, former reporter and truth teller. And I found a timeline she
[03:09:16.660 --> 03:09:25.340]  had done. And follow me, come with me on this journey, okay? Talking about fake news. According
[03:09:25.340 --> 03:09:31.820]  to the timeline that Cheryl Atkinson had done, the very first iteration or the very
[03:09:31.820 --> 03:09:39.660]  first use of the phrase fake news in its current iteration by the leftist media took place
[03:09:39.660 --> 03:09:48.180]  on September 13th of 2016, not 2017, not 2018, not 2010, not, no, no. Just two years
[03:09:48.180 --> 03:09:55.900]  ago, less than two years ago, the nonprofit First Draft funded by Google, whose parent
[03:09:55.900 --> 03:10:04.900]  company is run by Major Hillary Clinton supporters and donor Eric Schmidt, announces an initiative
[03:10:04.900 --> 03:10:13.980]  to tackle fake news. This is on September 13th, two years ago, 2016. That appears to
[03:10:13.980 --> 03:10:20.460]  be the first use of the phrase in its modern context. All right, now, so again, woke up
[03:10:20.460 --> 03:10:27.300]  doing my show. Where did fake news come from? Where did this whole thing come from? Firstdraftnews.org.
[03:10:27.300 --> 03:10:34.580]  Well, who's Firstdraftnews.org and why are they stepping up to make sure that you and
[03:10:34.580 --> 03:10:39.420]  I, the idiots out there, apparently, we can't decide what's fake and what's not. And we
[03:10:39.420 --> 03:10:46.020]  have to be told, really, what's fake and what's not. Because, again, we know we're not smart
[03:10:46.020 --> 03:10:54.340]  enough on our own, so we've got to be educated. We cannot, goodness knows, that they cannot
[03:10:54.340 --> 03:11:00.620]  allow us to look at a Facebook posting or a Twitter posting and ask if it's genuine
[03:11:00.620 --> 03:11:09.900]  or authentic. God forbid that we would actually think for ourselves, so enter Firstdraftnews.org.
[03:11:09.900 --> 03:11:13.540]  They step in and they say, hey, we'll take care of you. Don't worry about it, Sonny.
[03:11:13.540 --> 03:11:17.740]  Don't worry about it, little girl. We're going to take care of you. If that sounds insulting,
[03:11:17.740 --> 03:11:23.580]  it was meant to be. It was meant to sound insulting. So I got to looking at Firstdraftnews
[03:11:23.580 --> 03:11:26.780]  and I'm thinking, all right, let's scroll down a little bit. Where's Firstdraftnews?
[03:11:26.780 --> 03:11:32.340]  Where does this come from? Well, it appears to be, and I was able to verify this, an offshoot
[03:11:32.340 --> 03:11:38.020]  of the Shorenstein Institute. And I'm looking at that and looking at that. All right, now
[03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:44.540]  hang on a second. Now, I'm grabbing some notes here. So I found that the Shorenstein Center
[03:11:44.540 --> 03:11:50.140]  on Media Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University, Der John F. Kennedy School of
[03:11:50.140 --> 03:12:00.140]  Government is the parent of this organization, Firstdraftnews.org. Which, again, when you
[03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:05.340]  dig deeper there and you go to that link, the Shorensteincenter.org and you go to that
[03:12:05.340 --> 03:12:12.940]  link and you click on this maze about us and who we are and all this. And we find out that
[03:12:12.940 --> 03:12:18.740]  it's funded, of course, by the usual suspects, funded by the progressive left, funded by
[03:12:18.740 --> 03:12:24.460]  the Ford Foundation, funded by all of the usual suspects who want to protect you, want to protect
[03:12:24.460 --> 03:12:29.820]  you and us, all of us, because we can't think for ourselves from fake news. All right, now
[03:12:29.820 --> 03:12:36.420]  why did I bring this up now? Well, what do we see taking place right now? All of a sudden,
[03:12:36.420 --> 03:12:42.900]  censorship. But it's not all of a sudden, they had this planned. They had this planned
[03:12:42.900 --> 03:12:52.020]  for a long time. This is a multifaceted war. We're seeing the censorship, the taking away
[03:12:52.020 --> 03:12:56.100]  of our First Amendment rights. We see that taking place right now. But it's not just
[03:12:56.100 --> 03:13:00.820]  the First Amendment. There is a great town hall piece, in fact, it's just up on the screen,
[03:13:00.820 --> 03:13:08.740]  by Kurt Schlifter. And I don't know the author of this piece, but he's dead right on this
[03:13:08.740 --> 03:13:13.860]  one, dead correct on this one. Folks, this is not just about taking the Second Amendment.
[03:13:13.860 --> 03:13:17.380]  This is about taking the Second Amendment and the First Amendment. In fact, the title
[03:13:17.380 --> 03:13:23.100]  of that article is they take the Second Amendment first and the First Amendment second. We've
[03:13:23.100 --> 03:13:27.780]  talked a lot, of course, about this liberal assault, this fascist assault on our right
[03:13:27.780 --> 03:13:35.860]  as American citizens to keep their arms, to protect against the rise of the potential
[03:13:35.860 --> 03:13:40.620]  rise of the tyrannical government. And people say, well, do you think that could really
[03:13:40.620 --> 03:13:48.140]  happen today? Well, I don't know. Look at history. Look at the democracies, and I use
[03:13:48.140 --> 03:13:52.980]  that term intentionally, as opposed to our constitutional republic. Look at the countries
[03:13:52.980 --> 03:13:58.740]  who are subjugated under the jack-booted thuggery of socialism and communism over the last,
[03:13:58.740 --> 03:14:11.380]  well, just during the 20th century. 262 million people were exterminated under the jack-booted
[03:14:11.380 --> 03:14:16.700]  thuggery of socialism and communism. You've got Stalin, and you know all of this. So what
[03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:21.060]  is happening here? They're using that template, they meaning the progressive left, the liberal
[03:14:21.060 --> 03:14:28.260]  fascists, the people like the Feinstein's, like the Bloomberg's out there, like the mayor
[03:14:28.260 --> 03:14:38.260]  of New York and governor of New York. I mean, anyone who speaks against gun ownership and
[03:14:38.260 --> 03:14:45.780]  the code language here, oh, we need sensible gun ownership. We need sensible gun laws.
[03:14:45.780 --> 03:14:51.300]  That's what they say. That's not what they're doing. You heard it before. You heard it last
[03:14:51.300 --> 03:14:56.340]  week and the week before, March 4, our lives, they give us an inch. We're going to take
[03:14:56.340 --> 03:15:03.300]  a mile. They're exploiting all of these incidents. And Ben Shapiro, just to kind of veer off
[03:15:03.300 --> 03:15:09.900]  a little bit, Ben Shapiro was taught, I heard an interview between him and Piers Morgan.
[03:15:09.900 --> 03:15:18.460]  And this was just a brilliant interview because coming out of the gate, Ben Shapiro told Piers
[03:15:18.460 --> 03:15:24.900]  Morgan, accused him of standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook. And that destabilized
[03:15:24.900 --> 03:15:30.740]  Piers Morgan for the entirety of the interview. Folks, we need to take command. We need to
[03:15:30.740 --> 03:15:38.420]  take back control of the debate. Learn from interviews like that to we need to frame the
[03:15:38.420 --> 03:15:42.700]  debate because we are under attack. They're not just coming for this. Our guns, they're
[03:15:42.700 --> 03:15:49.220]  coming for us. I've talked about this many, many times. Steve Gwyle on this episode, this
[03:15:49.220 --> 03:15:52.540]  platform as well. Folks, you're going to write back, stay right where you're at. Doug Hagman

[03:17:55.260 --> 03:18:00.260]  The Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged the discovery of a rogue network of cellular
[03:18:00.260 --> 03:18:04.940]  eavesdropping devices discovered throughout Washington, D.C. The devices can be mounted
[03:18:04.940 --> 03:18:10.260]  in vehicles, drones, helicopters and airplanes and are often used by spies and criminals
[03:18:10.260 --> 03:18:15.860]  to track an eavesdrop on private cellular devices. The agency did not say how many devices were
[03:18:15.860 --> 03:18:20.460]  detected or where they found them. American intelligence and law enforcement agencies
[03:18:20.460 --> 03:18:25.660]  routinely use similar eavesdropping equipment in the field. The stingray units operate by
[03:18:25.660 --> 03:18:31.020]  tricking a cellular device into locking onto them instead of a legitimate cell tower. Stingray
[03:18:31.020 --> 03:18:36.340]  devices allow the user to gain highly specific information on the location of any particular
[03:18:36.340 --> 03:18:41.700]  phone down to a particular apartment complex or hotel room. More sophisticated versions
[03:18:41.700 --> 03:18:47.820]  can eavesdrop on calls by forcing phones to step down to the older, unencrypted 2G wireless
[03:18:47.820 --> 03:18:54.380]  channel. Some stingray devices can even plant malware on a phone. Leigh Ann McAdoo InfoWars.com.
[03:18:54.380 --> 03:18:58.780]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[03:18:58.780 --> 03:19:03.500]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[03:19:03.500 --> 03:19:09.180]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield. Toxic metal and chemical defense
[03:19:09.180 --> 03:19:15.060]  support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[03:19:15.060 --> 03:19:19.180]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars. It is a classical
[03:19:19.180 --> 03:19:24.300]  360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we
[03:19:24.300 --> 03:19:29.580]  believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[03:19:29.580 --> 03:19:33.700]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[03:19:33.700 --> 03:19:38.660]  this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[03:19:38.660 --> 03:19:43.940]  you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[03:19:43.940 --> 03:19:47.820]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and
[03:19:47.820 --> 03:19:51.620]  your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies

[03:20:21.620 --> 03:20:31.100]  Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones, InfoWars.com. That's where you need to go for all of your
[03:20:31.100 --> 03:20:36.380]  current news information. My home base, by the way, is HagmanReport.com. I'm sitting
[03:20:36.380 --> 03:20:43.540]  here in freezing Northwest Pennsylvania, of course, but you know, it's, hey, I got into
[03:20:43.540 --> 03:20:48.140]  my office at 4.30 this morning, saw snow on the ground and what is this day? I mean, it's
[03:20:48.140 --> 03:20:52.980]  April, it's spring, come on now. An interesting discussion with Dan Wiginton about the weather
[03:20:52.980 --> 03:20:56.780]  yesterday or last night on our flagship show, the Hagman Report. But that aside, the last
[03:20:56.780 --> 03:21:02.020]  segment I was talking about really the origin of fake news, where this came from, it just
[03:21:02.020 --> 03:21:09.740]  got my attention. And following it backwards, I can see where the progressive left the fastest
[03:21:09.740 --> 03:21:14.060]  and the progressive left, when I say that, it just kind of, I have this thing in my mind
[03:21:14.060 --> 03:21:19.900]  where, what's progressive about this, it's regressive. But the left, the liberal fascist,
[03:21:19.900 --> 03:21:27.500]  my terms, by the way, the duggers believe that you are not smart enough to, you know,
[03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:32.380]  to decide what's correct and what's not, they've got to tell you. And by the way, see, here's
[03:21:32.380 --> 03:21:41.740]  the thing, and here's why this is important. If the leftists, the general, the usual suspects,
[03:21:41.740 --> 03:21:47.020]  the Democratic Party that is really turned into the Socialist slash Communist Party,
[03:21:47.020 --> 03:21:52.100]  which has turned into the Fascist Party, have you seen the evolution of what's going on
[03:21:52.100 --> 03:21:53.100]  taking us to today?
[03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:59.580]  Have you seen, have you noticed this? And this is why, for example, Alex Jones is going
[03:21:59.580 --> 03:22:06.820]  to be speaking at the National Press Club on Tuesday, April 10. Well, this is part of
[03:22:06.820 --> 03:22:14.660]  it. It's not exactly why this is all part of it. The progressive or the liberal fascists,
[03:22:14.660 --> 03:22:18.980]  what they want you to believe is you're not intelligent enough to determine what's fake
[03:22:18.980 --> 03:22:26.700]  news and what's real news. So they're going to help you along. But here's the key. If
[03:22:26.700 --> 03:22:32.980]  you don't follow their advice, if you don't accept them as the sole arbiters of the truth,
[03:22:32.980 --> 03:22:40.380]  they will pull the plug. In other words, what we're seeing today, because the pushback against
[03:22:40.380 --> 03:22:48.020]  fake news, Donald Trump's grabbing of that phrase and using it, turning it back onto
[03:22:48.020 --> 03:22:53.020]  the progressive or the liberal fascists, what they have done is they've kind of, what Donald
[03:22:53.020 --> 03:22:59.420]  Trump has done, President Donald Trump has done is kind of put them on the run. And now
[03:22:59.420 --> 03:23:06.820]  the only, really at this point, the only way that they can respond is to censor the content,
[03:23:06.820 --> 03:23:15.060]  the ideology, the morals, the pro-second amendment, pro-life, pro-free speech. So the only thing
[03:23:15.060 --> 03:23:20.460]  they can do is pull the plug. That's it. And that's what we're seeing today. So this was
[03:23:20.460 --> 03:23:25.540]  not a sudden move by YouTube. This wasn't a sudden move by Facebook. This wasn't an
[03:23:25.540 --> 03:23:31.660]  organic spontaneous operation. This was heavily planned out. And this really started under
[03:23:31.660 --> 03:23:38.700]  Obama. And why? Well, it was just merely to stifle up the opposition. Yes, but it was
[03:23:38.700 --> 03:23:47.060]  also to cover criminality. So for just to be clear now, and again, the townhall.com and
[03:23:47.060 --> 03:23:51.180]  call them this by the name of Kurt Schlichter. This past week wrote an excellent column.
[03:23:51.180 --> 03:23:54.700]  They take the second amendment first and the first amendment second. It was up on the screen
[03:23:54.700 --> 03:23:57.580]  before. They don't want you to speak freely. They don't want you to have access to a free
[03:23:57.580 --> 03:24:00.580]  press. They don't want you to practice your religion as you see fit. All of this in the
[03:24:00.580 --> 03:24:07.060]  crosshairs of these loony-tuned liberal fascists. And in the view of the elite, of course, you're
[03:24:07.060 --> 03:24:12.260]  helpless. You need them. And if you don't feel that you need them, they're going to
[03:24:12.260 --> 03:24:19.340]  force compliance, force you to compliance. So that's that. Now, this is an important
[03:24:19.340 --> 03:24:25.100]  part that are important issue that I want to get into. And some news that came here
[03:24:25.100 --> 03:24:32.340]  this week. In fact, just last night, there was some information about McCabe and about
[03:24:32.340 --> 03:24:36.540]  the ongoing coup that's taking place in this country. But before I get to that, let me
[03:24:36.540 --> 03:24:42.820]  just let me just ask you folks to support this operation, fund this operation, fund
[03:24:42.820 --> 03:24:48.300]  in the full wars. Go to infowarstore.com. They've got a marvelous selection of products, things
[03:24:48.300 --> 03:24:54.540]  that if you take the products that they offer, if you use them, and I mean use them, you're
[03:24:54.540 --> 03:24:59.820]  going to feel better than you've ever felt in your life. And they've got a number of
[03:24:59.820 --> 03:25:05.180]  weekly deals, a number of monthly deals. I'll say what, self-force right now, 50% off. It's
[03:25:05.180 --> 03:25:13.260]  a cellular energy production, promoting free radicals, scavenging. The benefits of this
[03:25:13.260 --> 03:25:17.020]  would take me, I'd be here all day talking about the benefits of the self-force. Right
[03:25:17.020 --> 03:25:25.220]  now, apparently, 50% off. Retail price, $149.99. And directory sale price, 50% off, $74.95.
[03:25:25.220 --> 03:25:32.060]  There it is, right there. You save $75 over just a tad over 50%. And of course, Brainforce
[03:25:32.060 --> 03:25:38.580]  Plus and Real Red Pill Mind and Body Challenge Pack, 50% off in store for a limited time.
[03:25:38.580 --> 03:25:45.620]  So put your, how can you help? You might say, well, I can't do anything. I'm not behind
[03:25:45.620 --> 03:25:52.060]  on a microphone. I don't have any internet presence. You can help by funding the operation.
[03:25:52.060 --> 03:25:57.660]  Go to infowarstore.com because it's so important. If you want this, if you want the information
[03:25:57.660 --> 03:26:03.500]  to keep coming, and I'm a big believer in that. In the remaining couple of minutes I
[03:26:03.500 --> 03:26:09.260]  have, I want to talk directly about McCabe, what happened here recently. Folks, you remember,
[03:26:09.260 --> 03:26:17.100]  and this is my introduction to the next segment. You remember McCabe? He had a GoFundMe page.
[03:26:17.100 --> 03:26:20.740]  Did you know that that GoFundMe page, and this is kind of one of those little details
[03:26:20.740 --> 03:26:26.100]  that you're not going to hear anywhere else. It was sponsored by a PR firm in DC that just
[03:26:26.100 --> 03:26:32.180]  happens to be founded by McCabe's lawyer. This, based on my information, as best I can
[03:26:32.180 --> 03:26:41.100]  come up with, Michael Bromwich. Bromwich did work in the Obama regime. It used to be against
[03:26:41.100 --> 03:26:48.220]  the cannons of ethics to do things like this. Did it not? Lawyers out there? Well, a lawyer
[03:26:48.220 --> 03:26:54.220]  forming a firm from which you raise funds on behalf of a client so you can pay yourself
[03:26:54.220 --> 03:27:00.820]  on behalf of your client. This appears to be, at least in my assessment, this appears
[03:27:00.820 --> 03:27:06.940]  to be what is taking place with McCabe GoFundMe page. I'm just, again, this is what appears
[03:27:06.940 --> 03:27:11.620]  to me when I follow the breadcrumbs and look at this and look at the investigative links
[03:27:11.620 --> 03:27:18.460]  and follow my nose in the investigative trail. McCabe's GoFundMe page was sponsored by a PR
[03:27:18.460 --> 03:27:24.740]  firm in DC, again, that just happened to be founded by McCabe's lawyer. Where's the ethics
[03:27:24.740 --> 03:27:32.060]  in this? Case 3 PR firm right there on the screen. Is this not unethical? That's my question.
[03:27:32.060 --> 03:27:41.220]  Or is this not against the cannons of ethics to do things like this? So yesterday, actually,
[03:27:41.220 --> 03:27:44.780]  and this leading into the next segment, which you've got to stick with me on this because
[03:27:44.780 --> 03:27:49.620]  this is going to be some mind-blowing information. We just heard this week, Fox News just reported
[03:27:49.620 --> 03:27:56.460]  last night, that the McCabe firing, based on a new documentation, this is not old stuff.
[03:27:56.460 --> 03:28:01.700]  This is confirming, but it's also new that McCabe's firing was the consequence of three
[03:28:01.700 --> 03:28:08.220]  violations. Now, their language is lack of candor. Under oath, lack of candor, not under
[03:28:08.220 --> 03:28:12.260]  oath. And then the improper disclosure of non-public information, meaning confidential
[03:28:12.260 --> 03:28:16.580]  information to the media about the investigation in the Clinton Foundation. Let me tell you
[03:28:16.580 --> 03:28:22.900]  something about this. It's lying under oath. It's lying, not under oath. And it's leaking.
[03:28:22.900 --> 03:28:31.700]  So you can cut the fancy words here. Let's talk plain speak. When you learn what I'm
[03:28:31.700 --> 03:28:37.140]  about to tell you next about McCabe, about McCabe's wife, this letter, the information,
[03:28:37.140 --> 03:28:41.940]  this letter from the Devin Dunes, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,
[03:28:41.940 --> 03:28:45.820]  is going to make your socks roll up and down. So stay right where you're at. You're listening

[03:33:14.780 --> 03:33:30.260]  InfoWars, fighting the battle, fighting you, being at the tip of the spear of the resistance
[03:33:30.260 --> 03:33:33.980]  and boy does it feel good to be at the tip of that spear, leading the resistance, Doug
[03:33:33.980 --> 03:33:39.620]  Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones, who's away going to be speaking at the National Press
[03:33:39.620 --> 03:33:47.340]  Club April 10th in the Zanger Room. This about the tactics of the liberal fascists, of course,
[03:33:47.340 --> 03:33:53.540]  the unleashing of all of the attacks against InfoWars, the attacks against Alex Jones himself.
[03:33:53.540 --> 03:33:58.540]  He's going to engage in remarks and a question and answer with respect to the anti-first
[03:33:58.540 --> 03:34:04.260]  amendment lawsuits levied against him. And of course, myself, Steve Cuell and others,
[03:34:04.260 --> 03:34:10.060]  no stranger to those. Alex, of course, is as usual at the tip of the spear on that,
[03:34:10.060 --> 03:34:15.860]  fighting and exposing. It will be exposing the swamp and delivering remarks and again,
[03:34:15.860 --> 03:34:21.500]  an engaging question and answer on the anti-first amendment lawsuits at the National Press Club.
[03:34:21.500 --> 03:34:25.540]  Zanger Room, and just look on the screen. Now, if you're listening to this via radio
[03:34:25.540 --> 03:34:30.460]  or if you have this up and you're driving, don't look at any screen. Look at the road.
[03:34:30.460 --> 03:34:35.820]  Zanger Room, 529 14th Street, Northwest Washington, DC. That's where it's at Tuesday,
[03:34:35.820 --> 03:34:44.060]  April 10th, 8 o'clock Central, 9 o'clock Eastern. And you've got to RSVP to press at InfoWars.com.
[03:34:44.060 --> 03:34:50.580]  You know, I'm going to do my best to get there because I want to, I understand what he's going
[03:34:50.580 --> 03:34:58.340]  through. And folks, if you don't think this is a war, I'll just say this. Everybody who is anti-first
[03:34:58.340 --> 03:35:05.260]  and second amendment, everyone who is anti-truth is just pulling out all stops to silence InfoWars,
[03:35:05.260 --> 03:35:10.500]  silence this operation, the operation you're listening to, which is why I consider, I'm very
[03:35:10.500 --> 03:35:17.380]  humbled, but I considered privilege to be sitting in for Alex Jones because the level of crap that
[03:35:17.380 --> 03:35:21.260]  he's going through. And it's not, you know, when he mentions a little about the lawsuits,
[03:35:21.260 --> 03:35:27.820]  as I mentioned on my morning show this morning, it's not just about whether you win. It's not
[03:35:27.820 --> 03:35:34.660]  that. It's about the progressive fascists, the haters of the freedom, the haters of us,
[03:35:34.660 --> 03:35:41.060]  the people who seek and then tell the truth. It's about how much damage they can inflict.
[03:35:41.060 --> 03:35:46.500]  And I just want to ask you a question to those people out there listening and viewing. Have
[03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:54.100]  you ever been the defendant in a meritless lawsuit? Do you know what kind of havoc that
[03:35:54.100 --> 03:35:58.540]  wreaks on a business? How about your personal life when you've got a shell out 10, 20, 30,
[03:35:58.540 --> 03:36:06.140]  40 grand for a retainer and then expend three, four, $500 an hour for attorneys? Ultimately,
[03:36:06.140 --> 03:36:13.420]  is it to have it dismissed? Hey, you won. Oh, yeah? You won? Yeah, what did you win? You
[03:36:13.420 --> 03:36:17.860]  invested a whole lot of money, you diverted resources, you diverted time into this. This
[03:36:17.860 --> 03:36:23.500]  is exactly the tactics. These are the tactics of the left. This is what's happening. So this
[03:36:23.500 --> 03:36:32.540]  is a new front, the weaponization of the judicial system, the weaponization of courts. And in
[03:36:32.540 --> 03:36:38.180]  my case, I was threatened with a gag order for just merely speaking like this. And I'm
[03:36:38.180 --> 03:36:43.700]  going to tell you right now, I'm not going to be gagged, nor will Alex Jones be gagged.
[03:36:43.700 --> 03:36:48.860]  And thank God we've got patriots like that. But that's not really, that kind of got off
[03:36:48.860 --> 03:36:53.660]  on a left-handed trail there. What I want to talk about, and I made a mistake before,
[03:36:53.660 --> 03:37:00.580]  is talking about McCabe and some things that happened with McCabe this week. I want to,
[03:37:00.580 --> 03:37:05.140]  and I said, I had some information about McCabe's wife. Wait a second, that's Jill McCabe.
[03:37:05.140 --> 03:37:10.100]  We all know her. We all know that, but hold on a second here. What I meant to say, I've
[03:37:10.100 --> 03:37:19.620]  got some information about Rod Rosenstein's wife. This ties into what had happened this
[03:37:19.620 --> 03:37:27.860]  week with McCabe, Lisa Page, the information that she provided. But who is Rod Rosenstein?
[03:37:27.860 --> 03:37:36.020]  Of course, Rod Rosenstein, essentially the guy running the Department of Justice, Justice
[03:37:36.020 --> 03:37:43.340]  Maine. Of course, he's Deputy Attorney General under Jeff Sessions. But he's really running
[03:37:43.340 --> 03:37:51.860]  the special counsel as well. Let's take a look at Rod Rosenstein's wife, shall we,
[03:37:51.860 --> 03:38:03.180]  Lisa H. Barsoomian. Who is she? And does it matter? I know this. I go home and speak
[03:38:03.180 --> 03:38:09.140]  with my wife after work and we talk about things and over the dinner table or whatever.
[03:38:09.140 --> 03:38:16.140]  And there is some influence that my wife has with respect to what I say and where I direct
[03:38:16.140 --> 03:38:23.220]  my focus. I mean, it's just normal, right? We're guys. We talked to our wives. So when
[03:38:23.220 --> 03:38:30.060]  we look at really the dynamics here, this woman, this mystery woman of intrigue, let's
[03:38:30.060 --> 03:38:35.180]  take a look at what's involved here. Now, everything I'm about to say, it's open source
[03:38:35.180 --> 03:38:41.180]  information and or the results of my investigative findings. If I am wrong in any of these, oh,
[03:38:41.180 --> 03:38:46.980]  I'd love to be heard. Let me know. But a check on using the electronic record system, the
[03:38:46.980 --> 03:38:53.940]  PACER system and other proprietary databases has led me to this and other information.
[03:38:53.940 --> 03:38:58.880]  Did you know that the Rod Rosenstein's wife, a U.S. Attorney who graduated from George
[03:38:58.880 --> 03:39:07.980]  Sharm Law is a protege of James Comey and Robert Mueller? Now, I guess that makes sense, right?
[03:39:07.980 --> 03:39:16.700]  With her boss, our Craig Lawrence represented Bill Clinton in 1998. Now, Lawrence also represented
[03:39:16.700 --> 03:39:23.740]  Robert Mueller three times. And this is associated with Lisa Barsoomian, who is Rod Rosenstein's
[03:39:23.740 --> 03:39:29.580]  wife. Got to follow you and keep a scorecard with all these people. Represented James Comey
[03:39:29.580 --> 03:39:38.620]  five times, Barack Hussein Obama 45 times, Kathleen Sibelius 56 times, Bill Clinton 40
[03:39:38.620 --> 03:39:47.300]  times, and Hillary Clinton 17 times between 1998 and 2017. She herself, Barsoomian herself,
[03:39:47.300 --> 03:39:53.820]  Rod Rosenstein's wife represented the FBI at least five times during that period. And
[03:39:53.820 --> 03:40:00.220]  you may ask yourself again, well, who cares about the work history of this woman, Rod
[03:40:00.220 --> 03:40:09.060]  Rosenstein's wife? Well, someone does. When you start looking at her background, you start,
[03:40:09.060 --> 03:40:15.300]  if you use certain search terms, for example, Rod Rosenstein's wife, wife of Rod, whatever
[03:40:15.300 --> 03:40:20.380]  variation of these search terms that you use, you're going to find that a lot has been
[03:40:20.380 --> 03:40:27.500]  purged about the, about the wife of Rod Rosenstein, Lisa Barsoomian, court documents for her Clinton
[03:40:27.500 --> 03:40:34.660]  representation in Hamburg v. Clinton back in 1998. And it's a subsequent appeal in 99
[03:40:34.660 --> 03:40:41.180]  from the DC District Court and appeal dockets, court dockets gone, gone. Of course, you're
[03:40:41.180 --> 03:40:45.860]  going to see what they want you to see, which ties into the censorship, which ties into
[03:40:45.860 --> 03:40:51.180]  the fact that, wait a minute, we have to determine what's fake news, which ties into the fact
[03:40:51.180 --> 03:40:58.020]  that if we can't direct you to what we want you to see, we are just going to call it fake
[03:40:58.020 --> 03:41:02.820]  news and even worse, purge it from the Internet. This is what's taking place. And this is why
[03:41:02.820 --> 03:41:08.700]  all of this is connected and so important. Someone out there cares so much that the
[03:41:08.700 --> 03:41:15.180]  Internet has purged all information or virtually all of it with respect to the working relationship
[03:41:15.180 --> 03:41:22.700]  with the swamp. So Rod Rosenstein, his wife, looking at this, yeah, there's some stuff
[03:41:22.700 --> 03:41:28.380]  going on. And it's interesting because one particular piece of information, and I don't
[03:41:28.380 --> 03:41:32.860]  know who you'd have credit this on, but I'm going to just go with this and whoever found
[03:41:32.860 --> 03:41:38.660]  this, I want to thank you for doing so. Barsoomian has been involved in hundreds of cases representing
[03:41:38.660 --> 03:41:44.980]  the D.C. office and the U.S. Attorney. Her email address is, if you look at it, Lisa Barsoomian
[03:41:44.980 --> 03:41:56.260]  at NIH.gov. Now, why is that important? The NIH stands for National Institutes of Health.
[03:41:56.260 --> 03:42:05.260]  When I saw that, I knew exactly what that is. You see, this is a tactic. Using NIH or
[03:42:05.260 --> 03:42:14.620]  using other government fronts is a tactic to protect operatives of the CIA. It's Standard
[03:42:14.620 --> 03:42:22.700]  Operating Fair. It's SOP Standard Operating Policy. It's used to shield their CIA or classified
[03:42:22.700 --> 03:42:28.580]  CIA type activities. Pay attention to the details here. You might think, well, it's
[03:42:28.580 --> 03:42:32.780]  a cover, so no big deal. What is one more attorney with the rise of the U.S. Intelligence
[03:42:32.780 --> 03:42:37.620]  Community, really? What does that matter? Well, it matters a whole bunch, and I'm going
[03:42:37.620 --> 03:42:43.380]  to be explaining why it matters as we move to close out today's program. It's going to
[03:42:43.380 --> 03:42:50.620]  be very interesting. I'm getting hand signals from my tech here. You're listening to Dan
[03:42:50.620 --> 03:42:53.260]  Fowler, Stug Hamion, sitting in for Alex Jones. I'm going to be right back.
[03:42:53.260 --> 03:42:58.460]  It looks like America is starting to wake up from the lies and disinformation. 77 percent
[03:42:58.460 --> 03:43:04.580]  of Americans polled recently by Monmouth University believe that the old legacy media like CNN
[03:43:04.580 --> 03:43:09.660]  and The New York Times regularly report fake news. The survey asked respondents, do you
[03:43:09.660 --> 03:43:14.260]  think these sources report these stories on purpose in order to push an agenda, or do
[03:43:14.260 --> 03:43:18.780]  they tend to report them more by accident or because of poor fact-checking? The majority
[03:43:18.780 --> 03:43:24.580]  of respondents at 42 percent said they believe it is to push an agenda, while 26 percent
[03:43:24.580 --> 03:43:29.500]  went with poor fact-checking. Additionally, the survey found that 83 percent believe special
[03:43:29.500 --> 03:43:34.660]  interest groups are intentionally trying to implant false information into the news cycle,
[03:43:34.660 --> 03:43:39.860]  and even more believed those tentacles reached all the way into social media sites and YouTube.
[03:43:39.860 --> 03:43:44.580]  And it's not just conservatives who are waking up to the obvious bias and propaganda pushing
[03:43:44.580 --> 03:43:50.060]  of the legacy media. A whopping 61 percent of Democrats are in agreement. You are fake
[03:43:50.060 --> 03:43:50.900]  news.
[03:43:50.900 --> 03:43:56.420]  And MacadooInfoWars.com. After years of research working with top developers here in the United
[03:43:56.420 --> 03:44:03.180]  States with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut
[03:44:03.180 --> 03:44:09.540]  aids. One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break
[03:44:09.540 --> 03:44:16.500]  down meat and other proteins better. And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live
[03:44:16.500 --> 03:44:22.580]  probiotic culture of the very best strains in fluorolife advanced restoration. And we
[03:44:22.580 --> 03:44:28.060]  also have an everyday, extremely affordable fluorolife everyday maintenance. But all of
[03:44:28.060 --> 03:44:36.420]  these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely
[03:44:36.420 --> 03:44:43.540]  affordable price. That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price
[03:44:43.540 --> 03:44:48.700]  when you purchase it. And then for our store.com, you know, you are also financing the attack
[03:44:48.700 --> 03:44:52.660]  on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:44:52.660 --> 03:45:00.580]  Let's go to Debit in Florida. Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:45:00.580 --> 03:45:05.940]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're
[03:45:05.940 --> 03:45:12.020]  amazing. Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got caveman, superman vitality,
[03:45:12.020 --> 03:45:15.860]  secret swell, vitamin, and infusion. I've got the body armor.
[03:45:15.860 --> 03:45:20.020]  Wow, thank you. You're the top of the list that makes it all possible. Which pharmaceutical
[03:45:20.020 --> 03:45:24.900]  does you like best? I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest. That's amazing.
[03:45:24.900 --> 03:45:28.820]  That's really incredible. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:45:28.820 --> 03:45:33.420]  Like, I haven't felt sweet. My morning was fantastic. And I love the guys, I love the
[03:45:33.420 --> 03:45:39.460]  info, it's true. And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody
[03:45:39.460 --> 03:45:44.020]  out there who's on the fence, just buy it. You will love it. I'm telling you, I've never
[03:45:44.020 --> 03:45:48.580]  bought a bad product. What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products
[03:45:48.580 --> 03:45:54.260]  at infowarslife.com. It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[03:45:54.260 --> 03:46:00.940]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back. It's mycozx plus lower price, more ingredients
[03:46:00.940 --> 03:46:06.540]  because we scaled up, signed to your contract with even bigger organic manufacturer and
[03:46:06.540 --> 03:46:13.780]  producer scalability. But now we're able to go 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off
[03:46:13.780 --> 03:46:18.020]  because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient, mycozx. Now, it's the other
[03:46:18.020 --> 03:46:21.580]  side of the equation. Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your
[03:46:21.580 --> 03:46:25.420]  gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides. But more importantly
[03:46:25.420 --> 03:46:31.980]  than bad bacteria, the probiotics help this place. Yeast mold creates slime walls. And
[03:46:31.980 --> 03:46:36.980]  once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts
[03:46:36.980 --> 03:46:41.420]  of serious issues. Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds
[03:46:41.420 --> 03:46:45.980]  known to destroy that slime wall. Don't wait to start any toxifying your body until it's
[03:46:45.980 --> 03:47:05.060]  too late. Pick up a bottle of the new and improved mycozx plus now from the info wars store.
[03:47:05.060 --> 03:47:22.340]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[03:47:22.340 --> 03:47:28.660]  to Alex Jones.
[03:47:28.660 --> 03:47:35.020]  Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones, Alex Jones who's off in part going to the National
[03:47:35.020 --> 03:47:40.860]  Press Club. I'm going to be talking about the attempted gagging and he's going to have
[03:47:40.860 --> 03:47:47.020]  none of it of Alex Jones by those people who want to shut you up, shut him up and by extension
[03:47:47.020 --> 03:47:52.340]  shut all of us up. And of course, Alex Jones is going to be appearing at the National Press
[03:47:52.340 --> 03:47:57.420]  Club Tuesday, April 10th. You've got it. Yeah, I'll tell you what, you got to either get
[03:47:57.420 --> 03:48:03.980]  there, listen to him, but the importance of what he's going to say is I cannot overstate
[03:48:03.980 --> 03:48:09.900]  how important this is. Just if you're watching this, it's on screen. If you're listening
[03:48:09.900 --> 03:48:14.220]  to this and you're playing this on an iPhone or other similar device and you've got a screen.
[03:48:14.220 --> 03:48:18.220]  Don't look at the screen if you're driving, but it's going to mean a zinger room of 529
[03:48:18.220 --> 03:48:25.260]  14th Street, Northwest Washington DC Tuesday, April 10th, 9 o'clock Eastern time for RSVP.
[03:48:25.260 --> 03:48:31.300]  And the two press at infowars.com. Again, this is going to be about the anti-first amendment
[03:48:31.300 --> 03:48:38.980]  lawsuits levied against info wars and hey, against even us and myself and the people
[03:48:38.980 --> 03:48:44.980]  such as Steve Cuell and others on the receiving end of lawsuits, anti-defamation suits designed
[03:48:44.980 --> 03:48:51.980]  to or intended to cripple us because if they can't control what we say and they can't control
[03:48:51.980 --> 03:48:57.060]  what you listen to, they've got to take a step further and that's to basically attempt
[03:48:57.060 --> 03:49:01.540]  to shut us down through a number of means and this is one of those means.
[03:49:01.540 --> 03:49:05.380]  Before the break, I was talking about Rosenstein's wife and you might say, well, why is this
[03:49:05.380 --> 03:49:11.500]  important? Well, Rosenstein is the de facto head of the Attorney General Department of
[03:49:11.500 --> 03:49:17.620]  Justice under sessions appointed Mueller Special Counsel. Rosenstein, of course, has control
[03:49:17.620 --> 03:49:24.740]  over the special counsel information this week about Rosenstein or about McCabe, the
[03:49:24.740 --> 03:49:33.620]  firing, which was a consequence of the blowback against or the, which was a consequence of
[03:49:33.620 --> 03:49:40.140]  the parallel, let's just say parallel, the investigation can be conducted in part by
[03:49:40.140 --> 03:49:45.340]  the Inspector General Michael Horowitz in response to or in tandem with the Mueller
[03:49:45.340 --> 03:49:48.660]  investigation on opposing sides.
[03:49:48.660 --> 03:49:53.980]  So news about that, but I want to finish up here with Rosenstein's wife with respect
[03:49:53.980 --> 03:49:59.300]  to her, why this is a big deal, why you need to know about her. Because as the wife of
[03:49:59.300 --> 03:50:04.180]  the Deputy Attorney General, you ought to be paying attention to this and you've got
[03:50:04.180 --> 03:50:11.740]  to know that why is this important? It's quite simple. The guys you know this, women you
[03:50:11.740 --> 03:50:16.820]  know this, if you're out there and your husband and wife, traditional husband and wife, you've
[03:50:16.820 --> 03:50:24.540]  got influence on the spouse at least at some level. She's the Assistant Attorney General,
[03:50:24.540 --> 03:50:32.700]  Rod Rosenstein's wife, that's why it's important. Her name again, Lisa Bar-Sumion, and her loyalties
[03:50:32.700 --> 03:50:38.660]  basically, and these are my words, are tainted. How could this not, how could her loyalties,
[03:50:38.660 --> 03:50:44.620]  when you look back, and you consider that Attorney General Jeff Sessions essentially
[03:50:44.620 --> 03:50:53.580]  has recused himself and some say he's taking what, a 16 month nap or a 14 month nap with
[03:50:53.580 --> 03:51:00.580]  occasional forays into throwing himself into the legalization of marijuana mix or the anti-legalization
[03:51:00.580 --> 03:51:02.900]  there.
[03:51:02.900 --> 03:51:07.740]  But Mueller's never ending investigation into collusion between the Donald Trump team and
[03:51:07.740 --> 03:51:14.020]  the Russians now. One more time, why does Bar-Sumion, the wife of Rod Rosenstein, CA
[03:51:14.020 --> 03:51:20.460]  operative merit, any mention? Because again, she's his wife. Her loyalties are appear to
[03:51:20.460 --> 03:51:24.980]  be tainted. How could anything that she doesn't said in the past, how could that have not
[03:51:24.980 --> 03:51:30.340]  influenced Rosenstein's decisions current and former? Both owe their careers by the
[03:51:30.340 --> 03:51:40.460]  way to U.S. Attorney's to Mueller, to Obama, to Bush, and to Clinton. Impartiality, not
[03:51:40.460 --> 03:51:45.580]  quite there. And again, I don't know who to cite on this, the compilation of information
[03:51:45.580 --> 03:51:52.380]  and forgive me for the lack of citation, but this is also part, not only their citations
[03:51:52.380 --> 03:51:56.820]  or not only their information, but things I've put together. But you'll find all of
[03:51:56.820 --> 03:52:03.940]  this to be out there on open source places. But some of this is not, some of this has
[03:52:03.940 --> 03:52:08.140]  already been purged and they want you to remain in the dark about this.
[03:52:08.140 --> 03:52:13.300]  But when you look at this, does Rod Rosenstein have, in fact, have any business involving
[03:52:13.300 --> 03:52:18.540]  himself in the Hillary Clinton DNC funded steel dossier in the ongoing Russia investigation
[03:52:18.540 --> 03:52:27.700]  considering the loyalties? And this brings me to, well, the ethics there, or lack thereof,
[03:52:27.700 --> 03:52:32.340]  which brings me into something that happened this week, which I've got to tell you about
[03:52:32.340 --> 03:52:33.340]  before I do.
[03:52:33.340 --> 03:52:38.340]  I just want to mention one more time, folks, this operation, InfoWars, depends on your

[03:53:25.060 --> 03:53:30.300]  decades, but put packed a lot of life into it, and the information, the spunk that that
[03:53:30.300 --> 03:53:37.540]  man has, and the family has. It's fantastic, and part of that is feeling good, feeling
[03:53:37.540 --> 03:53:44.740]  good, of course. You can use the goodinfosstore.com and grab yourself some Brainforce Plus and

[03:53:54.660 --> 03:54:00.180]  to fight at a moment's notice. But Catherine Harage, getting back to the content here,
[03:54:00.180 --> 03:54:07.060]  Catherine Harage confirmed Lisa Page statements this week that contradict, where Lisa Page
[03:54:07.060 --> 03:54:13.660]  actually contradicted Andrew McCabe, and again, who's Andrew McCabe. Well, Andrew McCabe
[03:54:13.660 --> 03:54:21.700]  is part of the DOJ FBI morass. We had a situation where we're looking at, by the way, I have
[03:54:21.700 --> 03:54:27.140]  tipped to conservative treehouse Sundance for all of the information, and I'm getting short
[03:54:27.140 --> 03:54:28.140]  on time here.
[03:54:28.140 --> 03:54:33.100]  So for all of the information with respect to the nuances of the McCabe, Rosenstein
[03:54:33.100 --> 03:54:40.140]  sessions, that whole, that whole morass, this whole Mueller mess, conservative treehouse
[03:54:40.140 --> 03:54:46.900]  Sundance, Sarah Carter has done just a tremendous job, as has Hannity and Greg Jarrett. And
[03:54:46.900 --> 03:54:51.100]  if you think that people are not sitting up and paying attention to that, well, you're
[03:54:51.100 --> 03:54:52.500]  not paying attention.
[03:54:52.500 --> 03:54:57.140]  But really quickly in closing this week, and let me see if I grab my notes here on this.
[03:54:57.140 --> 03:55:02.660]  This week, Devin Nunes, who is the head of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,
[03:55:02.660 --> 03:55:06.940]  the majority head of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, drafted
[03:55:06.940 --> 03:55:13.140]  a letter, as I look through my notes here, letters here somewhere. But ultimately, demanding
[03:55:13.140 --> 03:55:20.100]  the unredacted, here it is right here, sent on April 4th, 2018, sent a letter to Rod Rosenstein,
[03:55:20.100 --> 03:55:25.220]  remember I talked about his wife, and Christopher Wray, the head of the FBI, demanding compliance
[03:55:25.220 --> 03:55:32.380]  with the previously submitted subpoena for unredacted documents pertaining to electronic
[03:55:32.380 --> 03:55:38.140]  communications about who. Ultimately, when you read this letter, it ultimately leads
[03:55:38.140 --> 03:55:44.620]  back to Brennan, which ultimately leads back to Obama. The Obama regime, the reason I'm
[03:55:44.620 --> 03:55:51.460]  kind of closing out with this is because what is taking place right now? Is everything
[03:55:51.460 --> 03:55:57.160]  is being exposed for all of us to see? And it's clear that the Mueller investigation
[03:55:57.160 --> 03:56:04.300]  is nothing but a distraction, an unethical one at that against or to prevent the exposure
[03:56:04.300 --> 03:56:08.900]  of the criminal collusion and the attempted coup against Donald Trump and the will of
[03:56:08.900 --> 03:56:10.580]  the American people.
[03:56:10.580 --> 03:56:15.700]  Devin Nunes on Wednesday, submitting a letter saying enough is enough. I want the unredacted
[03:56:15.700 --> 03:56:23.300]  version of the documents he provided previously. And what that will show is the connections,
[03:56:23.300 --> 03:56:28.420]  the names, not the least of which could be, and is very likely, John Brennan, the former
[03:56:28.420 --> 03:56:37.540]  head of the CIA, and his involvement, perhaps, into the coup attempt that began before Donald
[03:56:37.540 --> 03:56:39.020]  Trump was elected.
[03:56:39.020 --> 03:56:44.100]  So there are some things that are happening there. In addition to that, Catherine Heritage
[03:56:44.100 --> 03:56:48.980]  has reported this week, and this is the other part of the coin, the other side of this issue
[03:56:48.980 --> 03:56:54.300]  that we have to follow. Additional confirmations to why McCabe was fired. McCabe, of course,
[03:56:54.300 --> 03:57:01.540]  was fired for three, for cause, three purposes, lying under oath, lying while not under oath,
[03:57:01.540 --> 03:57:05.700]  and improper disclosure or leaks of information to the media about the investigation into
[03:57:05.700 --> 03:57:06.700]  the Clinton Foundation.
[03:57:06.700 --> 03:57:12.620]  I don't know if you can really see this, but you see all of this ties together? And why
[03:57:12.620 --> 03:57:17.340]  are we being silenced now? Why are we being silenced right now? Because they don't want
[03:57:17.340 --> 03:57:22.340]  the information, the liberal fascists, the media, they don't want this information to
[03:57:22.340 --> 03:57:27.700]  get out. It's as simple as that. Really, it is. But it's quite complex when you get into
[03:57:27.700 --> 03:57:29.460]  the minutiae of it.
[03:57:29.460 --> 03:57:34.340]  Folks, Doug Hagman, again, sitting in for Alex Jones, infowars.com, the tip of the spear,
[03:57:34.340 --> 03:57:38.380]  fighting for your right to speak, fighting for your right to bear arms. To speak, God
[03:57:38.380 --> 03:57:42.740]  bless each and every one of you. Thank you so much for listening. Until next time, InfoWars,
[03:57:42.740 --> 03:57:43.740]  Doug Hagman, sending in.
[03:57:43.740 --> 03:57:49.020]  InfoWars Life Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds. And
[03:57:49.020 --> 03:57:50.020]  for a good reason.
[03:57:50.020 --> 03:57:53.780]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were, what
[03:57:53.780 --> 03:57:58.340]  were most popular, what were best, what people liked. And we made it even stronger. Then
[03:57:58.340 --> 03:58:03.980]  we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup. We only have
[03:58:03.980 --> 03:58:10.180]  150 percent. Then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's 50 percent off. That means
[03:58:10.180 --> 03:58:16.860]  we've got a 25 percent markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes
[03:58:16.860 --> 03:58:21.700]  about seven days to kick in. Brain Force takes about 30 minutes, but the two go together.
[03:58:21.700 --> 03:58:27.700]  It's the mind and body challenge. They're both 50 percent off individually or together
[03:58:27.700 --> 03:58:33.700]  they're 50 percent off and free shipping with the combo at infowarslife.com. But it's got
[03:58:33.700 --> 03:58:39.700]  to end in a couple of days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out infowarslife.com
[03:58:39.700 --> 03:58:44.020]  to get your Brain Force Plus and real red pill today.
[03:58:44.020 --> 03:58:50.380]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[03:58:50.380 --> 03:58:56.780]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[03:58:56.780 --> 03:59:04.420]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution. I mean, I
[03:59:04.420 --> 03:59:09.420]  cannot say it any clearer. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[03:59:09.420 --> 03:59:13.580]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[03:59:13.580 --> 03:59:18.620]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it. You cannot beat that
[03:59:18.620 --> 03:59:22.660]  for children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones. That's my
[03:59:22.660 --> 03:59:29.820]  dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well. infowarslife.com or triple-A2533139. And your
[03:59:29.820 --> 03:59:34.580]  purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against
[03:59:34.580 --> 03:59:38.100]  the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies. And that's who they are and they
[03:59:38.100 --> 03:59:45.100]  know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
