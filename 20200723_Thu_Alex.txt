[00:00.000 --> 00:20.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show.
[00:20.840 --> 00:25.280]  This is Info Wars Live.
[00:25.280 --> 00:30.160]  I am Owen Schreuer, sitting in studio for Alex Jones today.
[00:30.160 --> 00:36.440]  We're going to be hearing from Alex coming up in the next segment and after that with
[00:36.440 --> 00:39.200]  some breaking news.
[00:39.200 --> 00:46.680]  You know, I was thinking to myself last night, I even wrote this note here.
[00:46.680 --> 00:53.120]  And it's not like one of those things where, oh, never bow to the mob or never apologize.
[00:53.120 --> 00:54.120]  You know what?
[00:54.120 --> 01:02.240]  I really do want to apologize today because I am guilty of just, I don't even know what
[01:02.240 --> 01:07.360]  it is, but I just, I get on air and I get all wound up and it's obnoxious and I rant
[01:07.360 --> 01:09.280]  and I yell and I say inappropriate things.
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.320]  And I really do wish I could do better than that.
[01:13.320 --> 01:21.480]  It's just this broadcast and Info Wars is like an atom bomb, a nuclear bomb of information
[01:21.480 --> 01:23.440]  every day.
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.560]  And so you're going to get a little radioactive when you're at the center of it.
[01:28.560 --> 01:34.180]  And when you stare into the abyss for so long, you become the abyss.
[01:34.180 --> 01:39.680]  And then there's this underlying frustration that just builds up and mounts up every day.
[01:39.680 --> 01:46.200]  It just gets worse and worse when it's not even to say that we have the solutions or
[01:46.200 --> 01:52.440]  we have all the answers or like, hey, we told you so, it's just like, how much longer do
[01:52.440 --> 01:58.240]  we have to sit here and put up with this knowing what's going on, pretending it's not there,
[01:58.240 --> 01:59.640]  having it covered up?
[01:59.640 --> 02:02.760]  I mean, does everything like, is it total death?
[02:02.760 --> 02:04.000]  Is that what it'll take?
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.280]  Because it'll be too late then.
[02:08.280 --> 02:12.560]  And so there's frustration, there's passion, and I don't mean to yell at you.
[02:12.560 --> 02:13.560]  It's rude.
[02:13.560 --> 02:15.080]  It's obnoxious.
[02:15.080 --> 02:19.400]  And so I'm thinking to myself last night, I'm going to make sure that I don't do that.
[02:19.400 --> 02:25.560]  In fact, why don't you just stay away from the news and just try to keep that filth away
[02:25.560 --> 02:31.720]  from you and just open up phone lines on the Alex Jones show today.
[02:31.720 --> 02:32.720]  And then I can't even help it.
[02:32.720 --> 02:34.520]  It's like a vortex.
[02:34.520 --> 02:35.520]  I just fall right into it.
[02:35.520 --> 02:42.320]  I've got all these stacks of news, lack lies matter, leaders that are pedophiles with child
[02:42.320 --> 02:43.320]  porn.
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.600]  I mean, the list just goes on and on, just the total madness, the total destruction,
[02:47.600 --> 02:52.520]  the total chaos in Portland and all these other Democrat run cities, how they blame
[02:52.520 --> 02:55.040]  Trump for everything that's their fault.
[02:55.040 --> 02:58.320]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[02:58.320 --> 02:59.560]  Now they're blaming Trump.
[02:59.560 --> 03:02.880]  I mean, literally, we saw it all coming.
[03:02.880 --> 03:04.880]  Trump is friends with Maxwell.
[03:04.880 --> 03:06.320]  Trump knew Maxwell and Epstein.
[03:06.320 --> 03:08.600]  Well, Trump was running Maxwell and Epstein.
[03:08.600 --> 03:16.840]  That'll be what they say next, but it's really, it's really a sick twisted.
[03:16.840 --> 03:18.200]  It's not even an ideology.
[03:18.200 --> 03:23.560]  It's a sick twisted state of being state of mind.
[03:23.560 --> 03:25.600]  It's it's psychopathic.
[03:25.600 --> 03:27.400]  It's sociopathic.
[03:27.400 --> 03:28.400]  It's suicidal.
[03:28.400 --> 03:30.400]  It's a death cult.
[03:30.400 --> 03:34.720]  It's modern day liberalism.
[03:34.720 --> 03:40.400]  And you have Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland going out last night, and it's the protesters
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.720]  that throw objects at him and chant, you know, F Wheeler, get out Wheeler, kind of like
[03:44.720 --> 03:48.560]  what they did to the mayor of Minneapolis Frey.
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.280]  And then what does the news say?
[03:50.280 --> 03:57.880]  Oh, Trump's feds attack again, Trump's feds attack Wheeler, even though it's all on video
[03:57.880 --> 04:02.800]  of him being harassed by the citizens, by the protesters, by the writers.
[04:02.800 --> 04:04.520]  It doesn't even matter.
[04:04.520 --> 04:05.880]  The news just covers it up.
[04:05.880 --> 04:07.480]  The news just lies about it.
[04:07.480 --> 04:11.480]  You see, I'm already getting worked up and I'm not even five minutes into the broadcast
[04:11.480 --> 04:14.360]  and I don't want to go there today.
[04:14.360 --> 04:15.520]  I want to stay calm today.
[04:15.520 --> 04:18.360]  I don't want to raise my voice today.
[04:18.360 --> 04:26.160]  So what I think I may just have to do before my guest Andrew Torbuck comes on is just take
[04:26.160 --> 04:29.880]  your phone calls and maybe just let you rant and rave.
[04:29.880 --> 04:35.440]  We just give you the baton to rant and rave because I just don't want to do that today.
[04:35.440 --> 04:40.360]  Now when we come back, Alex Jones has some breaking news.
[04:40.360 --> 04:42.960]  So Alex is going to give you the latest updates.
[04:42.960 --> 04:47.080]  And then when I take over in about 30 minutes, I may just go right to your phone calls.
[04:47.080 --> 04:51.040]  I may just skip the news from my own mental health today and go right to your calls.
[04:51.040 --> 04:52.040]  But we shall see.
[04:52.040 --> 04:54.480]  It's all coming up on the Alex Jones show.
[04:54.480 --> 04:59.080]  Alex Jones up in 60 seconds.
[04:59.080 --> 05:00.480]  It's Christmas in July.
[05:00.480 --> 05:01.720]  We ran the sale last year.
[05:01.720 --> 05:03.520]  It was very, very popular.
[05:03.520 --> 05:08.400]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important
[05:08.400 --> 05:09.400]  election year.
[05:09.400 --> 05:15.320]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[05:15.320 --> 05:21.000]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.400]  And the shirts are on sale right now in FullerStore.com.
[05:23.400 --> 05:29.560]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign having a similar shirt to be called Nazi, which of
[05:29.560 --> 05:30.560]  course it isn't.
[05:30.560 --> 05:33.400]  And since it's so triggering to the left, just the globalist, well, we're going to make
[05:33.400 --> 05:38.240]  sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise our First
[05:38.240 --> 05:39.840]  Amendment in the face of these targets.
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.560]  We also have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[05:43.560 --> 05:48.240]  So whatever great item it is that you want, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points
[05:48.240 --> 05:52.240]  on your next order, and at least 50% off across the board.
[05:52.240 --> 05:55.080]  Now I'm going to have to get this sale very, very soon because all these products are about
[05:55.080 --> 05:56.080]  to sell out.
[05:56.080 --> 06:10.640]  Just take advantage of it right now at FullerStore.com.
[06:10.640 --> 06:18.240]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:18.240 --> 06:22.840]  But this administration, this president has demonstrated that they have a capacity to
[06:22.840 --> 06:25.920]  go lower than we can even possibly imagine.
[06:25.920 --> 06:28.880]  So yeah, I think we have to be concerned about that.
[06:28.880 --> 06:33.960]  His attempt to talk about mail-in voting and all the fraud that is associated with it is
[06:33.960 --> 06:35.400]  factually incorrect.
[06:35.400 --> 06:41.040]  He's just trying to set up a situation where he has the ability to delegitimize a vote that
[06:41.040 --> 06:42.560]  he might lose.
[06:42.560 --> 06:47.200]  If he loses, and I expect that he will, then we have to be prepared for what he is going
[06:47.200 --> 06:51.560]  to do in the immediate aftermath of such a loss, and what he'll do for the time period
[06:51.560 --> 06:56.080]  between the election and the inauguration of the next president.
[06:56.080 --> 07:00.040]  We have to be prepared for things that this nation has never faced before.
[07:00.040 --> 07:05.520]  And unfortunately, that could involve the use of these forces.
[07:05.520 --> 07:11.480]  Who knows what he'll do, and the people who are as part of his administration will support
[07:11.480 --> 07:13.600]  him in doing it.
[07:13.600 --> 07:23.160]  When President Trump was elected in November of 2016, immediately, Obama Pentagon officials,
[07:23.160 --> 07:27.240]  people sworn to destroy the United States and set up China as the new dominant world
[07:27.240 --> 07:34.680]  power, publicly canvassed the Pentagon, going door to door, finding out how many of the
[07:34.680 --> 07:41.400]  military brass and others would support a military coup through COG.
[07:41.400 --> 07:48.920]  It's totally illegal, it's totally unconstitutional, it is not in a continental government.
[07:48.920 --> 07:54.720]  Battle plans that were started in the late 1940s, right through to today, it is nothing
[07:54.720 --> 07:56.440]  short of a coup.
[07:56.440 --> 08:03.360]  So they opted instead to go with the fake legal coups of Russiagate, Ukraine, and all
[08:03.360 --> 08:04.960]  the rest of it.
[08:04.960 --> 08:11.840]  But now that that has failed, they are publicly, first in the Council on Foreign Relations
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.040]  and other establishment organs like the Atlantic.
[08:16.040 --> 08:26.280]  And now with Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and CNN and MSNBC all stating that Trump is already
[08:26.280 --> 08:33.760]  a dictator and illegitimate, and they are inverting reality in saying he stole the 2016
[08:33.760 --> 08:34.760]  election.
[08:34.760 --> 08:40.120]  They decided to do it again and that they are going to contest the election and that
[08:40.120 --> 08:47.960]  if he can test their contesting that that is dictatorship, which of course it's not,
[08:47.960 --> 08:54.040]  and that they will then remove him using COG.
[08:54.040 --> 09:00.520]  Now Pelosi came out three days ago and said this, last night the former Attorney General
[09:00.520 --> 09:07.320]  under Obama, Eric Holder, came out and said that Trump is planning on using paramilitary
[09:07.320 --> 09:17.960]  troops across the United States to basically take over local governments and set up his
[09:17.960 --> 09:18.960]  own martial law.
[09:18.960 --> 09:24.720]  Now, of course, we've laid all this out with exact specifics and told you it was coming.
[09:24.720 --> 09:31.360]  Two years ago I did a special report on this and I said they will trigger race war nationwide
[09:31.360 --> 09:38.240]  in all the major cities, surround the White House and demand that the President step down.
[09:38.240 --> 09:43.640]  Even predicted they would do it specifically during the midterms or during the next 2020
[09:43.640 --> 09:49.480]  election because they'll use that as cover to say that the President is contesting the
[09:49.480 --> 09:52.360]  election when it's them that are contesting it.
[09:52.360 --> 09:56.040]  That's how I would battle plan it, that's how I would run it, studying their operations.
[09:56.040 --> 10:00.240]  Well, that is exactly the play that they are running.
[10:00.240 --> 10:06.440]  So understand, this has gone from the drawing board as one of their main attack profiles
[10:06.440 --> 10:15.160]  that if I was them I would run to now operational with them lining up the propaganda, the talking
[10:15.160 --> 10:17.240]  points for all this to unfold.
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.480]  So again, while we're all worried about the lockdown of the virus, while we're all worried
[10:20.480 --> 10:25.880]  about the race riding, all of that, that's the backdrop.
[10:25.880 --> 10:30.600]  So the American people are used to being locked down when they remove Trump.
[10:30.600 --> 10:37.360]  So people are used to the new normal of things not being normal and being under martial law.
[10:37.360 --> 10:45.840]  All of this is about normalizing blue cities, blue states, multinational corporations, taking
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.920]  governmental control of the United States and of Western Europe, Canada, New Zealand,
[10:51.920 --> 10:52.920]  Australia.
[10:52.920 --> 10:58.240]  This is a corporate takeover with China, militarily with intelligence agencies and money backing
[10:58.240 --> 10:59.480]  it up.
[10:59.480 --> 11:02.560]  This special globalism is a corporate takeover.
[11:02.560 --> 11:07.080]  And so you notice they are keeping the country locked down, Trump tries to stop, he tries
[11:07.080 --> 11:12.600]  to expose their fraud, then they blame him for the virus and Pelosi even calls it the
[11:12.600 --> 11:15.920]  Trump virus as China is now calling it the Trump virus.
[11:15.920 --> 11:23.560]  So not only are the Democrats and their minions engaged in treason, they're working with multinational
[11:23.560 --> 11:28.560]  foreign powers and the communist Chinese that have killed over 100 million of their own
[11:28.560 --> 11:35.880]  people and have 3 million Muslims, Christians and Buddhists in slave labor death camps on
[11:35.880 --> 11:36.880]  record.
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.680]  But remember, Democrats, globalists, Hollywood, while they shake their finger at you about
[11:42.680 --> 11:48.840]  a cop that might have killed somebody wrongfully, so we're all bad, literally are backing up
[11:48.840 --> 11:49.920]  modern death camps.
[11:49.920 --> 11:56.280]  So we're 100 days out from the election right now, about to be less than 100 days out.
[11:56.280 --> 12:01.000]  And Trump is starting to understand how much danger he and the country are in, he's not
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.840]  naive anymore, he's already made it through 3 coups or what's called the rolling coup.
[12:06.840 --> 12:15.200]  But I have begged all the other publications like The Daily Caller and Breitbart and The
[12:15.200 --> 12:20.720]  Gateway Pundit, everybody, to really make this the central issue.
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.480]  Because it's not just Alex Jones telling you this three and a half years ago now, because
[12:24.480 --> 12:30.080]  I was reading it in globalist battle plans, white papers, it's now out in the open and
[12:30.080 --> 12:32.880]  they're going to do this.
[12:32.880 --> 12:36.640]  So Trump's doing the right thing, sidelining Fauci and bricks and all the rest of them,
[12:36.640 --> 12:42.600]  but during these briefings, he needs to go directly at the fact that the NIH is still
[12:42.600 --> 12:48.200]  in control of policy and for every coronavirus positive, they're counting 15 more people
[12:48.200 --> 12:49.200]  bare minimum.
[12:49.200 --> 12:53.080]  That's why you see stories all over the country of people that don't even go into a clinic
[12:53.080 --> 12:57.000]  getting an email saying you've got coronavirus because somebody they knew tested positive
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.240]  or someone who goes into a clinic, they say no need to test you, then they go home and
[13:01.240 --> 13:02.640]  they're told you have coronavirus.
[13:02.640 --> 13:06.960]  Again, that's just one part of this fraud and then CNN has the nerve of all these stories
[13:06.960 --> 13:13.000]  about Trump's fumbling, Trump's doesn't believe in science, Trump's making stuff up when they're
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.400]  the ones that have made up this entire fraud and sent people that were sick to nursing
[13:18.400 --> 13:21.800]  homes to actually get a high kill number.
[13:21.800 --> 13:26.920]  Trump must go on the total offensive instead of being nice to Governor Newsom and nice
[13:26.920 --> 13:34.480]  to Governor Cuomo and nice to all these other pieces of trash, he has to expose the monstrous
[13:34.480 --> 13:39.960]  criminal globalist conspiracy they've been involved in with the Wuhan lab, which again
[13:39.960 --> 13:45.880]  Bill Gates and Fauci and the rest of them openly ran.
[13:45.880 --> 13:49.960]  This was a setup from the beginning when the impeachment was failing.
[13:49.960 --> 13:54.280]  They released the virus, which does spread, which has amazing gain of function.
[13:54.280 --> 13:59.240]  No one would kill a bunch of old people and then they could hype up the fear and any time
[13:59.240 --> 14:01.640]  they want to shut the economy down.
[14:01.640 --> 14:07.760]  So again, we're already under a form of martial law right now.
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.400]  The question is, are you going to let them put us into full martial law because now you
[14:12.400 --> 14:15.800]  notice they're talking about once Trump's gone, we're going to wipe out his base and
[14:15.800 --> 14:16.800]  take their guns.
[14:16.800 --> 14:18.120]  You're like, well, that'll start a war.
[14:18.120 --> 14:20.200]  They want a war to start.
[14:20.200 --> 14:25.360]  The chai comms and the globalists want a civil war to take the United States out of the equation.
[14:25.360 --> 14:28.520]  So for those of you that think, oh, the government doesn't want to destabilize things and wreck
[14:28.520 --> 14:31.040]  things, even if it's a corrupt government, they want the money in power.
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.920]  No, no, no, no, no, no, my friends, that's what the New World Order wants.
[14:35.920 --> 14:37.120]  That's their plan.
[14:37.120 --> 14:41.600]  And that's why only telling the truth about how much trouble we're in will defeat these
[14:41.600 --> 14:45.640]  rats, only telling part of the story we're going to lose.
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.800]  Whether he knows it or not, he will be leaving just because he might not want to move out
[14:50.800 --> 14:55.720]  of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate
[14:55.720 --> 14:59.320]  a duly elected president of the United States.
[14:59.320 --> 15:07.960]  And I'm second in line to the presidency and just last week I had my regular continuation
[15:07.960 --> 15:10.280]  of government briefing.
[15:10.280 --> 15:14.440]  This is my interest to you because I say to them, this is never going to happen.
[15:14.440 --> 15:16.160]  God willing, it never will.
[15:16.160 --> 15:17.600]  But there is a process.
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.320]  It has nothing to do with it, the certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving
[15:22.320 --> 15:27.880]  and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency.
[15:27.880 --> 15:30.360]  It's not geography or location.
[15:30.360 --> 15:36.760]  Here you have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[15:36.760 --> 15:43.400]  And you have so many rank and file military personnel saying, whoa, we're not a military
[15:43.400 --> 15:44.400]  state.
[15:44.400 --> 15:45.400]  This is not who we are.
[15:45.400 --> 15:50.080]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with
[15:50.080 --> 15:52.080]  great dispatch.
[15:52.080 --> 15:56.160]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back
[15:56.160 --> 15:57.160]  at you.
[15:57.160 --> 16:02.120]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[16:02.120 --> 16:04.960]  You can wear them out to political events, you can trigger live darts.
[16:04.960 --> 16:10.600]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party
[16:10.600 --> 16:16.200]  or at Halloween, but on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely
[16:16.200 --> 16:18.840]  nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[16:18.840 --> 16:23.360]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations and contact
[16:23.360 --> 16:25.440]  tracing of their openly, announce it.
[16:25.440 --> 16:27.240]  It's an act of submission.
[16:27.240 --> 16:30.680]  It's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down.
[16:30.680 --> 16:34.520]  But a big reason to wear these is then into stores, when people ask you why you're wearing
[16:34.520 --> 16:40.440]  a Halloween mask, say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth masks that you're wearing.
[16:40.440 --> 16:44.240]  On the M95 mask, only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[16:44.240 --> 16:47.800]  So they quote spread COVID-19, they don't protect from it.
[16:47.800 --> 16:50.760]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freak's faces.
[16:50.760 --> 16:56.960]  You buy one for 9.95, you get four more free, they're at cost infowarstore.com.
[16:56.960 --> 17:00.600]  Another part of the great awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been
[17:00.600 --> 17:06.160]  religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches
[17:06.160 --> 17:09.040]  have been burned in Europe and the US.
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.840]  Hundreds of Christian icons have been burned destroyed, Jesuses have had their heads cut
[17:13.840 --> 17:18.040]  off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all over Europe, Virgin Mary's are getting
[17:18.040 --> 17:19.040]  torn down.
[17:19.040 --> 17:20.800]  I mean, crosses are being torn down.
[17:20.800 --> 17:25.640]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real,
[17:25.640 --> 17:31.280]  it is spiritual, and it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface
[17:31.280 --> 17:32.280]  and now it's emerged.
[17:32.280 --> 17:35.480]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[17:35.480 --> 17:39.360]  I'm praying for America, I'm praying for you, and I know the power of prayer is real
[17:39.360 --> 17:40.360]  and God hears it.
[17:40.360 --> 17:44.880]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening, pray for Donald Trump
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.560]  to be protected, pray for him to win a landslide, and pray for the people under deception of
[17:50.560 --> 17:53.480]  the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[17:53.480 --> 18:08.800]  God bless you all, please pray for him for us as well.
[01:42.340 --> 18:40.680]  already underway.
[18:40.680 --> 18:45.600]  Major corporations backed by the communist Chinese with blue cities and blue states have
[18:45.600 --> 18:51.120]  already usurped power from Congress and from the president and are already in control of
[18:51.120 --> 18:57.680]  most of the United States, 800 plus sanctuary cities are only a small part of this larger
[18:57.680 --> 19:03.600]  operation where illegal aliens, many of them felons who have committed serious crimes are
[19:03.600 --> 19:09.360]  above the law and police are instructed not to even let ICE know where they are if they
[19:09.360 --> 19:13.760]  happen to pull them over and find out that they're a rapist or even a murderer.
[19:13.760 --> 19:18.520]  That's just one example of the lawlessness of the globalist and how Nancy Pelosi admits
[19:18.520 --> 19:23.380]  MS-13 is basically part of their paramilitary arm.
[19:23.380 --> 19:30.240]  This is the reality of communist China through their offices in the US shipping and fentanyl.
[19:30.240 --> 19:36.240]  This is part of the global alliance against the United States and now they're going to
[19:36.240 --> 19:42.520]  use the election as the trigger to create nationwide unrest, pretend Trump is a dictator
[19:42.520 --> 19:46.920]  and try to drive him from office through intimidation and lies.
[19:46.920 --> 19:52.240]  If that happens, Congress and the federal agencies will be completely stampeded under
[19:52.240 --> 19:57.360]  globalist communist control and a giant purge of the American people will explode onto the
[19:57.360 --> 19:58.360]  scene.
[19:58.360 --> 20:01.360]  That is the next phase of their operation.
[20:01.360 --> 20:02.760]  It always is.
[20:02.760 --> 20:08.080]  They're following a tried and true playbook because it's almost always worked, ladies
[20:08.080 --> 20:09.080]  and gentlemen.
[20:09.080 --> 20:15.440]  I cannot express to you enough the level of magnitude and danger that our constitutional
[20:15.440 --> 20:19.560]  republic is in, that the world is in.
[20:19.560 --> 20:26.640]  Paramilitary leftist forces have been turned loose to burn down buildings, attack police
[20:26.640 --> 20:31.240]  stations, burn police stations, occupy police stations.
[20:31.240 --> 20:37.160]  In some cities like Minneapolis, 400 plus businesses burned, dozens killed and the media
[20:37.160 --> 20:38.480]  calls them peaceful.
[20:38.480 --> 20:43.600]  They are setting the stage for total anarchy and death and when citizens stand up and defend
[20:43.600 --> 20:48.080]  their property like the McCluskey's in St. Louis, they are SWAT team rated and then they
[20:48.080 --> 20:54.560]  are indicted in the face of common law and the Second Amendment and the right to defend
[20:54.560 --> 20:55.840]  your property.
[20:55.840 --> 21:00.660]  This is all about the green light for the globalist and their communist ground forces
[21:00.660 --> 21:02.400]  to make their move.
[21:02.400 --> 21:08.960]  Trump must meet this head on and expose their entire paradigm before it's too late.
[21:08.960 --> 21:14.960]  They are now on record admitting Pelosi, Holder, Schumer, the list goes on and on that they
[21:14.960 --> 21:19.360]  plan to forcibly remove President Trump and anyone that doesn't go along with it will
[21:19.360 --> 21:21.480]  quote be put in prison.
[21:21.480 --> 21:26.480]  These are terrorists, these are people holding us hostage with the lockdown, preparing us
[21:26.480 --> 21:33.880]  for a bigger lockdown, normalizing that this alliance of criminal states and cities can
[21:33.880 --> 21:37.440]  carry out their lawless blockade of the country.
[21:37.440 --> 21:43.360]  We are under siege, we are under attack, this is a made a emergency situation.
[21:43.360 --> 21:51.480]  The denial must end, the fraud must stop, the people must speak out and say no before
[21:51.480 --> 21:55.120]  it is too late.
[21:55.120 --> 21:56.640]  Thank you, Alex.
[21:56.640 --> 22:01.680]  Back inside the Info Wars world headquarters in Austin, Texas, Owen Shroyer with you.
[22:01.680 --> 22:05.480]  Here's what we're going to do, I'm going to give out the phone number in the next segment.
[22:05.480 --> 22:10.120]  I'm going to cover some news now and then.
[22:10.120 --> 22:16.760]  And you know, I can understand if you're President Donald Trump and you got into office
[22:16.760 --> 22:19.920]  and you really weren't expecting this onslaught against you.
[22:19.920 --> 22:23.000]  You really didn't understand the forces of evil that were going to be lined up against
[22:23.000 --> 22:29.800]  you, against America to be in this position, but it's gotten so out of hand now.
[22:29.800 --> 22:34.720]  You either just have to be honest and say that this whole thing is getting blown right
[22:34.720 --> 22:42.920]  now by the White House, or you are a QAnon type who really believes that there's secret
[22:42.920 --> 22:45.960]  things going on behind the scenes and so all is going to be well.
[22:45.960 --> 22:49.760]  Now I don't necessarily believe that, I hope that with all my heart, I think like anybody
[22:49.760 --> 22:58.200]  else would, but for example, Operation Legend, it's a total failure, it's a total failure
[22:58.200 --> 22:59.200]  on its face.
[22:59.200 --> 23:00.200]  Why?
[23:00.200 --> 23:05.520]  Because what is the real goal, what you're going to go into these cities and stop the
[23:05.520 --> 23:06.520]  violence?
[23:06.520 --> 23:12.880]  Not going to stop the violence, just going to lead to more violence.
[23:12.880 --> 23:20.120]  And again, I get it, like you've got to go in and do something, but why do you think
[23:20.120 --> 23:23.080]  the mayor of Portland was out on the streets?
[23:23.080 --> 23:27.680]  Do you think he was out there to be a part of the solidarity of the movement?
[23:27.680 --> 23:31.200]  No folks, it was a setup.
[23:31.200 --> 23:36.360]  They knew if he went out there with his armed security that he'd be attacked and he'd be,
[23:36.360 --> 23:41.520]  you know, objects on Adam and Assault didn't curse that, they didn't care because they
[23:41.520 --> 23:45.240]  knew they could use that footage to blame the feds.
[23:45.240 --> 23:49.120]  So see, you lost.
[23:49.120 --> 23:54.960]  You are now playing checkers and they're playing chess.
[23:54.960 --> 24:00.320]  Operation Legend should have been, okay, we're going into Chicago and Portland in these cities
[24:00.320 --> 24:06.400]  and in the fog of the war, you go rip these Democrat mayors out of their offices and bring
[24:06.400 --> 24:09.960]  them in for questioning.
[24:09.960 --> 24:20.120]  You go rip any politician who has been in support of these riots, who has taken any
[24:20.120 --> 24:25.800]  foreign money, any Soros money, you go bring them in for questioning.
[24:25.800 --> 24:30.240]  That is Operation Legend.
[24:30.240 --> 24:33.520]  What's happening right now is Operation Setup.
[24:33.520 --> 24:39.000]  Look, I get it, you got to send the feds in, the Democrats are letting their cities burn
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  to the ground.
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.040]  In fact, better yet, the Democrats are burning their own cities to the ground to blame Trump.
[24:46.040 --> 24:52.680]  So until you deal with the cause and the root of this problem, which are Chinese funded,
[24:52.680 --> 25:01.080]  Soros funded Democrats in mayors offices, governor's offices, prosecuting attorneys,
[25:01.080 --> 25:08.200]  district attorneys, you're never going to win.
[25:08.200 --> 25:10.200]  You're always going to get beat.
[25:10.200 --> 25:19.240]  You're always going to get set up when I got to take a deep breath here because I'm
[25:19.240 --> 25:21.280]  starting to get mad again.
[25:21.280 --> 25:27.480]  It's just, how can you not see the total setup that the Democrats and the media engage in
[25:27.480 --> 25:29.400]  all day long?
[25:29.400 --> 25:34.120]  All these people do is alley-oop themselves up fake stories, whether it's Bubba Wallace
[25:34.120 --> 25:36.520]  or Jesse Smallette or now Ted Wheeler.
[25:36.520 --> 25:40.280]  Oh my gosh, Ted Wheeler got attacked by his own supporters.
[25:40.280 --> 25:42.760]  Oh, but what does the media tell you?
[25:42.760 --> 25:48.000]  Oh, it was the feds, the feds, the feds attacked Wheeler.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  No, they didn't.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.000]  That's a lie.
[25:50.000 --> 25:57.800]  It was all the BLM riders who, by the way, are 90% white.
[25:57.800 --> 25:59.080]  But see, it's all a joke.
[25:59.080 --> 26:02.720]  And you know, I really don't understand why Americans don't get this yet, like the headline
[26:02.720 --> 26:08.440]  from the Federalist, renaming the Redskins won't save a single black life.
[26:08.440 --> 26:09.440]  Really?
[26:09.440 --> 26:13.120]  Folks, none of this is about saving a black life.
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.240]  Black lives matter isn't even about black people.
[26:17.240 --> 26:22.600]  This is all about a takedown of America, a communist revolution.
[26:22.600 --> 26:26.280]  That's what this is.
[26:26.280 --> 26:33.440]  And if you try to deal with it as anything less than insurrection and treason, you will
[26:33.440 --> 26:34.440]  lose.
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.360]  I'm going to do a news blitz on the other side and give out the phone number because
[26:38.360 --> 26:41.760]  if I just, if I stare into this abyss for too long, I'm just going to start yelling
[26:41.760 --> 26:45.040]  again and I promised I wouldn't do that.
[26:45.040 --> 26:48.880]  So we're going to give out the number when we come back, do a news blitz.
[26:48.880 --> 26:50.680]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.920]  Here, Christmas in July, sale at infowarstore.com, free shipping store wide.
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.640]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[27:00.640 --> 27:02.360]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[27:02.360 --> 27:04.680]  Really they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[27:04.680 --> 27:09.080]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai
[27:09.080 --> 27:14.480]  Combs especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.880]  to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.000]  predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.520]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[27:29.520 --> 27:30.920]  In their own words, they admit it.
[27:30.920 --> 27:34.920]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than
[27:34.920 --> 27:35.920]  a decade.
[27:35.920 --> 27:39.360]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're Faraday cages, they just look like
[27:39.360 --> 27:42.640]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great.
[27:42.640 --> 27:47.640]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[27:47.640 --> 27:50.720]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to, because
[27:50.720 --> 27:51.720]  it's other business.

[28:06.160 --> 28:10.600]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[28:53.880 --> 28:59.320]  There are many reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown, but the
[28:59.320 --> 29:03.000]  number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.960]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[29:07.960 --> 29:12.280]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny forced
[29:12.280 --> 29:18.360]  inoculation, but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that
[29:18.360 --> 29:26.520]  we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over
[29:26.520 --> 29:29.480]  the jobs that people once had by design.
[29:29.480 --> 29:34.360]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[29:34.360 --> 29:39.760]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[29:39.760 --> 29:45.160]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks
[29:45.160 --> 29:51.640]  that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[29:51.640 --> 29:58.840]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[29:58.840 --> 30:13.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:13.400 --> 30:14.680]  I'm going to cover some news here.
[30:14.680 --> 30:17.520]  Give out the phone number at the end of this segment because I don't want to do a totally
[30:17.520 --> 30:18.960]  open phone line situation.
[30:18.960 --> 30:25.440]  I want to at least lay out some stories here that will get your brain churning before you
[30:25.440 --> 30:30.800]  dial on into the Alex Jones show today when Shroy are filling in.
[30:30.800 --> 30:34.600]  Let me just not hesitate and let me dive right in here.
[30:34.600 --> 30:40.480]  The COVID hoax continues, ladies and gentlemen, and I've decided there's going to be some
[30:40.480 --> 30:44.560]  headlines if you're a daily listener and stuff or even just old stories, older headlines
[30:44.560 --> 30:50.320]  that I'm just going to go back over today because, see, we have this weird thing where
[30:50.320 --> 30:54.720]  in a way we're almost like the drive-by media where, yeah, we'll cover a story and then
[30:54.720 --> 30:58.400]  there's no resolution and we just forget about it.
[30:58.400 --> 31:01.480]  And so because of that, that's like taking the loss.
[31:01.480 --> 31:05.200]  So I know you've read this story and heard this story before.
[31:05.200 --> 31:11.880]  I know that it's been on Infowars once, twice, three times, but I mean, it's still there.
[31:11.880 --> 31:17.200]  It's still like we should be carving it into mountains.
[31:17.200 --> 31:19.080]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[31:19.080 --> 31:22.680]  People who never took COVID tests being told they're COVID positive.
[31:22.680 --> 31:24.840]  So I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[31:24.840 --> 31:29.080]  It's like, yeah, I can cover this one day and move on or I can sit here and say it every
[31:29.080 --> 31:32.960]  day until people actually get it.
[31:32.960 --> 31:40.040]  They're faking a pandemic.
[31:40.040 --> 31:44.600]  I'm going to have to take a lot of deep breaths to not scream today and I really am going to
[31:44.600 --> 31:50.960]  focus on not doing that, but yeah, I tend to get a little worked up.
[31:50.960 --> 32:00.640]  I tend to get a little mad when they're faking a pandemic and destroying my future, destroying
[32:00.640 --> 32:09.680]  my country, lying about it the entire time, taking my liberties, taking my freedoms, faking
[32:09.680 --> 32:10.680]  a pandemic.
[32:10.680 --> 32:17.040]  Yeah, I'm pissed off.
[32:17.040 --> 32:21.080]  And so I guess it's just like a sign to just show y'all pissed I am, I start screaming and
[32:21.080 --> 32:23.560]  banging on the desk.
[32:23.560 --> 32:25.200]  I'm pissed, man.
[32:25.200 --> 32:32.240]  I mean, this shouldn't even be political.
[32:32.240 --> 32:33.240]  That's what's so frustrating.
[32:33.240 --> 32:38.000]  It shouldn't even be political.
[32:38.000 --> 32:44.440]  Connecticut State Lab finds 90 false positives out of 144 COVID tests.
[32:44.440 --> 32:48.280]  So they're faking the numbers, they're making up the numbers, they're rigging the numbers,
[32:48.280 --> 32:53.360]  they're inflating the numbers, they're faking a pandemic.
[32:53.360 --> 32:55.400]  Why is this even political?
[32:55.400 --> 32:58.680]  But I'll tell you why.
[32:58.680 --> 33:00.240]  Here's why.
[33:00.240 --> 33:07.600]  We know why Fauci and Gates and China and all these other people are faking the pandemic.
[33:07.600 --> 33:09.960]  They've got a secret plan for a new world order.
[33:09.960 --> 33:13.040]  Basically, I mean, really what it comes down to is they just want to have all their slave
[33:13.040 --> 33:15.080]  labor in China.
[33:15.080 --> 33:20.080]  And so all the worldwide corporations agreed, okay, well, you've got billions of people,
[33:20.080 --> 33:22.160]  you've got a slave labor force.
[33:22.160 --> 33:27.920]  So we'll put all the manufacturing and industry in China, but first we have to destroy America
[33:27.920 --> 33:31.560]  because they're still going to want to have that prosperity.
[33:31.560 --> 33:33.560]  So we've got to destroy America first.
[33:33.560 --> 33:36.840]  And then once we do that, we can just do all the slave labor in China and then we'll make
[33:36.840 --> 33:41.360]  all the goods and stuff and then we'll kind of roll out everything after that.
[33:41.360 --> 33:45.200]  Then Gates is involved and Fauci is involved, Obama was involved, they're all involved.
[33:45.200 --> 33:51.160]  All the big corporations that are faking this pandemic, they're all involved.
[33:51.160 --> 33:53.560]  But so why is it political?
[33:53.560 --> 33:58.240]  Why does the average dumbass liberal in the street buy into it?
[33:58.240 --> 34:06.000]  Folks, because they've been, this isn't a matter of just rhetoric here.
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.640]  These people have literally been brainwashed.
[34:08.640 --> 34:11.440]  They're literally under mind control.
[34:11.440 --> 34:23.760]  They're literally under a scientific light pattern and radio wave frequency mind control.
[34:23.760 --> 34:27.720]  Literally how do you deal with that?
[34:27.720 --> 34:36.840]  I would suggest all of these people that are getting arrested, not be taken to jail.
[34:36.840 --> 34:40.440]  We need to reopen mental institutions.
[34:40.440 --> 34:45.840]  All these leftists on the street need to be put in a mental institution and sat down with
[34:45.840 --> 34:50.240]  a doctor to explain what it is they're doing out there.
[34:50.240 --> 34:52.560]  I mean, let's try to get into their minds.
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.160]  This is a, this is a giant scientific experiment.
[34:57.160 --> 35:03.720]  They are the pawns of a scientific mind control device.
[35:03.720 --> 35:05.960]  They need to be evaluated.
[35:05.960 --> 35:10.960]  They need to be evaluated.
[35:10.960 --> 35:12.920]  I'm saying this because I care.
[35:12.920 --> 35:15.160]  If I didn't care about these people, you know what?
[35:15.160 --> 35:16.600]  I would be an authoritarian.
[35:16.600 --> 35:18.120]  I would want Trump to be a tyrant.
[35:18.120 --> 35:22.240]  I would want him to send in the feds, not with rubber bullets, not with paintballs,
[35:22.240 --> 35:25.960]  not with pepper balls, you understand?
[35:25.960 --> 35:27.560]  I care about these people.
[35:27.560 --> 35:29.920]  We need each other.
[35:29.920 --> 35:31.280]  I hate this, man.
[35:31.280 --> 35:34.760]  When I tune out of news for the night and I like to listen to music or, you know, watch
[35:34.760 --> 35:39.920]  a movie or something, and I can escape from the politics of thinking, man, America is
[35:39.920 --> 35:41.400]  so great.
[35:41.400 --> 35:47.000]  Look at all these great creative artists and musicians and like, it's just, it's awesome.
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.720]  Why do we fight all the time?
[35:48.720 --> 35:51.800]  How can we heal America?
[35:51.800 --> 35:55.840]  How can we heal America?
[35:55.840 --> 35:57.720]  They're faking a pandemic.
[35:57.720 --> 36:00.360]  It shouldn't even be political.
[36:00.360 --> 36:02.680]  Black lives matter is not about black lives.
[36:02.680 --> 36:11.960]  More black people have died in America because of black lives matter than have been saved.
[36:11.960 --> 36:13.440]  None of this should even be political.
[36:13.440 --> 36:14.920]  Why is it political?
[36:14.920 --> 36:24.080]  Because these people are under mind control, scientific mind control.
[36:24.080 --> 36:28.560]  They tested light patterns and frequencies on the TV.
[36:28.560 --> 36:30.640]  It's mind control.
[36:30.640 --> 36:37.480]  They know these radio waves from your cell phone weaken your inhibitions and your ability
[36:37.480 --> 36:41.200]  is to think slows your brain function.
[36:41.200 --> 36:45.400]  We are under attack humans, folks.
[36:45.400 --> 36:54.640]  Humanity is under a scientific attack.
[36:54.640 --> 36:56.280]  Let me just go on.
[36:56.280 --> 37:00.920]  Fox News, the N95 masks aren't stopping coronavirus.
[37:00.920 --> 37:03.360]  Health experts say, again, the masks don't even work.
[37:03.360 --> 37:08.400]  You had Cuomo in Georgia, Cuomo in Georgia, not wearing a mask.
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.200]  He's all praise for the mass murder he committed in the nursing homes and he tells you you'd
[37:12.200 --> 37:13.200]  have to wear a mask.
[37:13.200 --> 37:15.720]  He's down there in Georgia, doesn't even put on a mask.
[37:15.720 --> 37:20.160]  DC mayor exempts city and federal workers from mask policy.
[37:20.160 --> 37:24.160]  On same day, she launches investigation into President Trump for not wearing a mask in
[37:24.160 --> 37:28.360]  his own hotel.
[37:28.360 --> 37:32.440]  Again, folks, why do we put up with these people?
[37:32.440 --> 37:34.760]  Why does Trump put up with these people?
[37:34.760 --> 37:40.000]  Lincoln, very controversial president if you actually look into his history, but you talk
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.720]  to the average person, you study the average history textbook.
[37:42.720 --> 37:47.040]  They don't really get into the weeds of the controversy of Lincoln.
[37:47.040 --> 37:51.280]  Lincoln was arresting journalists and writers and all kinds of crap.
[37:51.280 --> 38:00.160]  It's like they don't even know about Robert E. Lee and it's just, you know, it's just
[38:00.160 --> 38:01.160]  a joke.
[38:01.160 --> 38:02.800]  Why do we put up with these people?
[38:02.800 --> 38:04.680]  And it always falls back.
[38:04.680 --> 38:07.520]  Mind control, brainwashing.
[38:07.520 --> 38:11.840]  Multiple vaccine doses could be necessary to protect from coronavirus, says Bill Gates,
[38:11.840 --> 38:13.840]  the guy selling you it.
[38:13.840 --> 38:20.840]  It's like you go to buy a new car and, you know, you can get a nice new car.
[38:20.840 --> 38:21.840]  You're in a little coop.
[38:21.840 --> 38:23.760]  You're like, okay, I like that one.
[38:23.760 --> 38:26.320]  And then the, and then the dealer's like, well, that's a nice coop there.
[38:26.320 --> 38:29.920]  I'll be happy to sell it to you, but you're probably going to need two of them.
[38:29.920 --> 38:31.920]  And he's, and you're just like, what?
[38:31.920 --> 38:35.520]  I don't, I'm, I just need the one.
[38:35.520 --> 38:37.520]  He's like, well, I think you're going to need two cars.
[38:37.520 --> 38:39.480]  It's like, oh, you're just trying to make money.
[38:39.480 --> 38:40.680]  You're just trying to sell a new car.
[38:40.680 --> 38:49.440]  That's literally what Bill Gates is doing, except with poison, except with poison, man
[38:49.440 --> 38:55.040]  who led Black Lives Matter protests arrested on child pornography charges.
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.920]  Ted Wheeler lies about being attacked by feds renaming the Redskins won't save a single
[38:59.920 --> 39:00.920]  black life.
[39:00.920 --> 39:02.480]  None of it's about black lives, folks.
[39:02.480 --> 39:07.160]  More black people are dead because of Black Lives Matter than alive.
[39:07.160 --> 39:13.320]  Zero national news networks cover photo of BLM supporter kneeling on white baby's neck.
[39:13.320 --> 39:16.720]  That individual, Isaiah Jackson has now been arrested.
[39:16.720 --> 39:22.400]  A special education teacher commented on that Facebook post and said, lean into it.
[39:22.400 --> 39:25.200]  Kill that baby.
[39:25.200 --> 39:26.800]  Stop effing around.
[39:26.800 --> 39:30.040]  Literally folks, lean into it until death.
[39:30.040 --> 39:33.960]  Black Lives Matter is now a mass murdering death cult.
[39:33.960 --> 39:37.760]  And what is going on with the Navy folks again, I have friends in the Navy.
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.920]  There's good people in the Navy, but Navy is investigating uniformed sailor Sarah Dudry
[39:42.920 --> 39:47.360]  for busting into pro-Trump rally, harassing protesters and screaming f-Trump.
[39:47.360 --> 39:52.280]  Plus all the Navy ships crashing into each other, standing down in the South China Sea,
[39:52.280 --> 39:55.040]  one's on fire, something's up in the Navy.
[39:55.040 --> 40:04.880]  Vicky Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated
[40:04.880 --> 40:05.880]  and then died.
[40:05.880 --> 40:10.720]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be
[40:10.720 --> 40:13.400]  an innovation, we know what's going to happen.
[40:13.400 --> 40:18.880]  It's a blue city, same story yet again, and they say her heart gave out.
[40:18.880 --> 40:23.840]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube in COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record,
[40:23.840 --> 40:26.480]  want everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed.
[40:26.480 --> 40:30.080]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[40:30.080 --> 40:34.960]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing
[40:34.960 --> 40:37.040]  an autoimmune response.
[40:37.040 --> 40:41.920]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying, it will kill you.
[40:41.920 --> 40:46.480]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.680]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[40:50.680 --> 40:55.200]  Don't end up like Vicky Gibbs or everyone.
[40:55.200 --> 40:57.120]  You can't make this stuff up.
[40:57.120 --> 41:03.200]  A consortium of the UNWHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes
[41:03.200 --> 41:08.120]  of Health, and of course, the Clinton Global Initiative, headed up by Chelsea Clinton on
[41:08.120 --> 41:14.760]  the board, are in control with Apple and Google with a hidden app on all phones that you cannot
[41:14.760 --> 41:15.760]  turn off.
[41:15.760 --> 41:19.720]  The track and trace everywhere you go, they claim for COVID, but of course, it's certainly
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.040]  the Chinese Communist social score rollout.
[41:23.040 --> 41:28.560]  These people are sick, filthy criminals, and they want total control over society with
[41:28.560 --> 41:31.040]  the official global ID system.
[41:31.040 --> 41:35.380]  That's why it's called the Clinton Global Initiative, but you can fight back with the
[41:35.380 --> 41:40.800]  privacy pockets at infowarstore.com, little Faraday cages, little envelopes, put your
[41:40.800 --> 41:46.320]  phone in it, and these dirty, scumbag, fascist pieces of garbage can't get all that data
[41:46.320 --> 41:48.960]  and rape you with that data.
[41:48.960 --> 41:49.960]  Rape your privacy.
[41:49.960 --> 41:56.000]  Tell the rapist Clintons go to hell and get your privacy pockets and infowar store.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.760]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, a second cup of the day.
[41:59.760 --> 42:04.160]  It's really strong, I shouldn't do this, because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive
[42:04.160 --> 42:06.120]  boy and the coffee adds to it, but mmm.
[42:06.120 --> 42:09.560]  Wake up America coffee there by loves, highest rated, in the choppest mountains.
[42:09.560 --> 42:12.760]  It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond Guatemalan coffee, it's the best coffee in the world.
[42:12.760 --> 42:15.600]  It's right on the border between the two countries, in those rainforests.
[42:15.600 --> 42:17.320]  Hand selected, it's beyond organic.
[42:17.320 --> 42:18.320]  Wildcrafted.
[42:18.320 --> 42:21.040]  Wake up America coffee, people are blown away by how good it is.
[42:21.040 --> 42:25.200]  Same stuff sold in Whole Foods on another name for $30 for the same size container.
[42:25.200 --> 42:28.360]  Yes, folks, we've been selling it 10 years, never raised the price.
[42:28.360 --> 42:35.040]  $15.95 is that big old bag, 99% reviews, $598 reviews, 4.9 stars on third party sites.
[42:35.040 --> 42:38.320]  Sign up for auto ship, additional 10% off, get it auto delivered to you, so don't forget
[42:38.320 --> 42:39.880]  to get it each month or every two months.
[42:39.880 --> 42:43.600]  You can click out to nine months whenever you want the new order coming in, 15 days
[42:43.600 --> 42:44.600]  up to nine months.
[42:44.600 --> 42:50.960]  Patriot blend medium roast, only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[42:50.960 --> 42:52.440]  It's not as popular.
[42:52.440 --> 42:56.960]  Anyways, it's all at infowarstore.com.
[42:56.960 --> 42:59.280]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[42:59.280 --> 43:00.280]  Thanks for holding.
[43:00.280 --> 43:01.280]  Hello, can you hear me?
[43:01.280 --> 43:02.280]  I sure can, sir.
[43:02.280 --> 43:03.280]  Thank you.
[43:03.280 --> 43:07.280]  Hey Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to
[43:07.280 --> 43:08.280]  be talking right now.
[43:08.280 --> 43:10.280]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[43:10.280 --> 43:13.720]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[43:13.720 --> 43:19.760]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers
[43:19.760 --> 43:20.760]  that drive.
[43:20.760 --> 43:26.920]  There's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on monster
[43:26.920 --> 43:32.240]  and Red Bull and Rola, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar,
[43:32.240 --> 43:34.000]  and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.520]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[43:38.520 --> 43:39.520]  there is.
[43:39.520 --> 43:42.560]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his name on
[43:42.560 --> 43:45.520]  it, because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this
[43:45.520 --> 43:49.200]  formulation, just for the design of it, and we believe it is the best, strongest, but
[43:49.200 --> 43:53.120]  healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means
[43:53.120 --> 43:54.120]  a lot to me.
[43:54.120 --> 43:55.120]  Thank you.
[43:55.120 --> 43:57.120]  I love you.
[43:57.120 --> 44:03.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[44:03.120 --> 44:22.000]  President Trump, this is an emergency warning to you.
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.960]  You're going to do everything, and you already know this, to steal the election, but here's
[44:26.960 --> 44:31.860]  what you may not know, and what your campaign staff is certainly not telling you.
[44:31.860 --> 44:38.040]  You're losing your base right now, and there's a lot of examples of this, and this is just
[44:38.040 --> 44:41.200]  giving it to you like it is, and you know what?
[44:41.200 --> 44:48.000]  Here's how I know that this is happening, and this just happened to me this week, and
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.920]  it just happened to me again today.
[44:51.920 --> 45:00.000]  I'm a creature of habit when it comes to my routine, and there's certain men that when
[45:00.000 --> 45:08.240]  they talk, I listen, and for about four or five years, President Trump has been one of
[45:08.240 --> 45:15.320]  those men, and I noticed just this week, with the Trump interview that was on Fox News,
[45:15.320 --> 45:21.920]  for the first time ever, I was completely uninterested in what President Trump was saying,
[45:21.920 --> 45:22.920]  and I didn't even realize it.
[45:22.920 --> 45:25.280]  It's just, oh, they were airing the Fox interview on Fox.
[45:25.280 --> 45:30.080]  I have a whole multimedia setup in my home to monitor everything, and usually I'd click
[45:30.080 --> 45:32.720]  over the audio, and I'd go listen to Trump.
[45:32.720 --> 45:36.280]  Instead I was listening to Dan Bongino or Michael Savage, I forget who it was, and usually
[45:36.280 --> 45:39.800]  I'd pause that, and I'd go listen to what Trump was saying, and for the first time ever,
[45:39.800 --> 45:44.560]  I just had no interest, and then it hit me, I was like, whoa.
[45:44.560 --> 45:47.280]  What does that symbolize?
[45:47.280 --> 45:50.080]  What does that symbolize?
[45:50.080 --> 45:54.160]  I've got a whole sheet of Trump clips.
[45:54.160 --> 45:57.960]  Normally I'd be going to those, hitting them all day.
[45:57.960 --> 46:00.400]  I don't want to.
[46:00.400 --> 46:01.400]  I don't want to.
[46:01.400 --> 46:02.480]  What does that symbolize?
[46:02.480 --> 46:04.640]  That's not good.
[46:04.640 --> 46:09.800]  So forget about America and all this other stuff.
[46:09.800 --> 46:14.120]  I mean, selfishly, President Trump, if you want to be reelected, you're losing a lot of
[46:14.120 --> 46:20.960]  your base, specifically women voters who now feel that they can't even leave their homes
[46:20.960 --> 46:27.680]  and feel safe, or be in their homes and feel safe, or send their kids out and feel safe.
[46:27.680 --> 46:32.120]  And I could reflect that in phone calls today if I wanted to.
[46:32.120 --> 46:34.880]  So with that, let me give out the phone number.
[46:34.880 --> 46:40.200]  Anything we discussed is fair game, but you know, what does that represent to you?
[46:40.200 --> 46:42.000]  Do you feel the same?
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.840]  Are you at the same kind of point with Trump where it's just like, you know what it is?
[46:46.840 --> 46:50.760]  It's that his words almost have no value to me anymore.
[46:50.760 --> 46:53.320]  And I'm just going to stop right there because I don't want to make a whole thing about it.
[46:53.320 --> 46:56.840]  But what does that represent to you?
[46:56.840 --> 46:58.080]  Are you in that same boat?
[46:58.080 --> 47:00.520]  Do you hang on Trump's every word like you used to you?
[47:00.520 --> 47:04.920]  Do you listen to Trump's words and speeches to give you hope and think that there's going
[47:04.920 --> 47:09.640]  to be results still, or have you moved on?
[47:09.640 --> 47:13.520]  So that'll be a main topic or any of the other news we discussed.
[47:13.520 --> 47:20.960]  The number 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[47:20.960 --> 47:24.840]  And for me, it's like, do I need to come on here and be more encouraging of Trump, or
[47:24.840 --> 47:27.560]  do I need to come on here and be more critical of Trump, or do I need to come on here and
[47:27.560 --> 47:30.560]  just act like Trump isn't there at all?
[47:30.560 --> 47:33.240]  Well, how about this?
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.400]  I mean, you know, Infowars next year is new today.
[47:37.400 --> 47:47.360]  And look, well, I'm not even going to go there, but folks, who would have predicted this series
[47:47.360 --> 47:48.360]  of news?
[47:48.360 --> 47:50.560]  Who could have seen this coming?
[47:50.560 --> 47:55.640]  Oh, a series of headlines from CNN in the last 24 hours.
[47:55.640 --> 47:56.840]  I wish her well.
[47:56.840 --> 48:00.520]  Trump's shocking support for just Lane Maxwell.
[48:00.520 --> 48:04.920]  Well, I don't know if you could call that support, but of course they're going to spin
[48:04.920 --> 48:09.000]  it because, as I told you, they're going to spin this thing so deep, they're going to
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.680]  claim Trump was running Epstein.
[48:11.680 --> 48:13.000]  You think that's nuts?
[48:13.000 --> 48:14.000]  They fake hate crimes.
[48:14.000 --> 48:15.320]  They fake pandemics.
[48:15.320 --> 48:17.120]  These people know no shame.
[48:17.120 --> 48:19.800]  They have no low.
[48:19.800 --> 48:21.280]  They reside in hell.
[48:21.280 --> 48:23.360]  Their consciousness is in hell.
[48:23.360 --> 48:24.760]  They can't go any lower than that.
[48:24.760 --> 48:26.760]  They'll fake anything.
[48:26.760 --> 48:29.080]  Another headline, CNN.
[48:29.080 --> 48:34.400]  Trump and Jislane Maxwell knew each other well, says former Epstein partner.
[48:34.400 --> 48:35.720]  You love this.
[48:35.720 --> 48:43.440]  So CNN actively reaches out to a guy who's knowingly partners with Epstein, a sex trafficker,
[48:43.440 --> 48:46.520]  a minority sex trafficker.
[48:46.520 --> 48:53.040]  I mean, as worse as it gets, me too, CNN, and they love this guy and they reach out
[48:53.040 --> 48:56.880]  to him and they get info from him and they do an interview and they, oh, he's the best
[48:56.880 --> 48:57.880]  ever.
[48:57.880 --> 48:58.880]  He's the one that will expose Trump.
[48:58.880 --> 49:01.200]  He's the one that was with Epstein.
[49:01.200 --> 49:04.000]  He's the one that was partnered with Epstein.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.560]  He's total bonkers.
[49:08.560 --> 49:14.080]  Another CNN headline, Trump claims not to be following Maxwell case despite long ties
[49:14.080 --> 49:15.440]  to Epstein.
[49:15.440 --> 49:18.600]  So it's like they literally covered up the Epstein thing.
[49:18.600 --> 49:21.120]  They literally covered up all the pedophilia.
[49:21.120 --> 49:23.840]  They literally covered up the sex trafficking.
[49:23.840 --> 49:27.920]  They literally bring on all the Epstein associates.
[49:27.920 --> 49:28.920]  And then what do they do?
[49:28.920 --> 49:31.760]  They blame Trump.
[49:31.760 --> 49:38.280]  These are sick people, sick people, sick people at CNN.
[49:38.280 --> 49:41.080]  Don Lemon is sick.
[49:41.080 --> 49:43.680]  And you know, I realized something too.
[49:43.680 --> 49:50.720]  You know, Don Lemon did a segment in 2013 about why black men in America struggle.
[49:50.720 --> 49:54.360]  And he was actually real and he said it's because there's no fathers.
[49:54.360 --> 49:55.840]  They get into a life of crime.
[49:55.840 --> 49:57.960]  They drop out of high school.
[49:57.960 --> 50:02.760]  They have a bad culture of gangbanging and drug running and pimping.
[50:02.760 --> 50:06.160]  And he called it all out in the whole CNN segment in 2013.
[50:06.160 --> 50:07.600]  Funny how that just disappears.
[50:07.600 --> 50:13.960]  But see, folks, even CNN hosts are brainwashed.
[50:13.960 --> 50:16.280]  Even CNN hosts are under mind control.
[50:16.280 --> 50:22.280]  Brianna Kylar on air yesterday with a doctor, or I'm not a doctor.
[50:22.280 --> 50:25.960]  It's like they're one of their guests and he's talking about hydroxychloroquine.
[50:25.960 --> 50:29.200]  He says, well, and she's like baskin, he's like, well, hydroxychloroquine has actually
[50:29.200 --> 50:30.680]  been used successfully in some studies.
[50:30.680 --> 50:33.480]  And she's like, how could you can't say that on my airwaves?
[50:33.480 --> 50:34.480]  Never say that again.
[50:34.480 --> 50:38.960]  And he's like, he's like, Brianna, this is coming from doctors, this has been known
[50:38.960 --> 50:39.960]  for decades.
[50:39.960 --> 50:44.160]  And she's like, I will not have you say a deadly drug is safe and effective.
[50:44.160 --> 50:47.520]  You're just repressing what the president is saying.
[50:47.520 --> 50:51.040]  And he's like, well, what are you, and she's like, I saw the doctors and scientists.
[50:51.040 --> 50:54.840]  And he goes, well, apparently not the doctors and scientists at CNN because folks, he was
[50:54.840 --> 51:02.120]  reading off a CNN story.
[51:02.120 --> 51:05.160]  They're so drunk on their own hatred.
[51:05.160 --> 51:08.520]  They're so blinded by their own hatred.
[51:08.520 --> 51:12.640]  They don't even live in reality anymore.
[51:12.640 --> 51:16.320]  How do you deal with these people?
[51:16.320 --> 51:19.960]  How do you deal with these people?
[51:19.960 --> 51:20.960]  Let me finish up this news.
[51:20.960 --> 51:24.440]  And I promise in the next segment, we're going to go all of these phone calls.
[51:24.440 --> 51:26.320]  The crew is getting them lined up.
[51:26.320 --> 51:32.440]  Adam Silver, that's the NBA commissioner, gives max donation to Joe Biden.
[51:32.440 --> 51:39.160]  Of course, the MLB opened up its season with Black Lives Matter protests and knees during
[51:39.160 --> 51:43.120]  the anthem and Black Lives Matter signs on their stadiums.
[51:43.120 --> 51:47.640]  Folks, I'm telling you something right now.
[51:47.640 --> 51:48.640]  And you know what?
[51:48.640 --> 51:51.480]  Maybe this will be part of the thing too, because I'm sure we have baseball fans and
[51:51.480 --> 51:54.720]  basketball fans and hockey fans and everybody listening right now.
[51:54.720 --> 52:00.000]  You know, I've been a St. Louis Cardinal fan for my whole life.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.960]  I used to go to, I'm not even exaggerating you.
[52:02.960 --> 52:05.280]  I would go to 40, 50 games a summer.
[52:05.280 --> 52:06.720]  It was the most fun thing.
[52:06.720 --> 52:11.720]  All I would do during the summer is I would go play baseball during the day for the local
[52:11.720 --> 52:13.440]  slobba team that I was on.
[52:13.440 --> 52:15.880]  We played about 50 to 60 games a year.
[52:15.880 --> 52:20.960]  And then at night, I would go watch the Cardinals play baseball for like three straight summers.
[52:20.960 --> 52:23.680]  It was like all I did.
[52:23.680 --> 52:29.480]  And I'd love to have a kid someday with that same experience, but let me tell you, if anybody
[52:29.480 --> 52:34.080]  on that franchise takes a knee, I'm done.
[52:34.080 --> 52:39.280]  And I guarantee you same thing for Giants fans, same things for Red Sox fans, same thing
[52:39.280 --> 52:42.880]  for all the Yankees are going to have a BLM message when they open their season.
[52:42.880 --> 52:43.880]  I mean, what a joke.
[52:43.880 --> 52:45.320]  There's no one in the stands anyway.
[52:45.320 --> 52:47.680]  They have cardboard cutouts in the stands.
[52:47.680 --> 52:49.360]  That's going to be your only fans left.
[52:49.360 --> 52:53.120]  They pipe in sound like a fake crowd on TV.
[52:53.120 --> 52:58.840]  I mean, pathetic NBA court revealed with Black Lives Matter logo.
[52:58.840 --> 53:03.640]  So the left has now killed sports, but ironically enough, COVID actually killed sports.
[53:03.640 --> 53:07.280]  And now the left, it's coming in with their propaganda just to put it in the grave.
[53:07.280 --> 53:10.400]  All right, I got some other news, but I got to do this.
[53:10.400 --> 53:12.720]  When I come back in the next segment, I'm going to go right to your calls.
[53:12.720 --> 53:20.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know about infowarstore.com.
[53:20.080 --> 53:21.800]  We have a Christmas in July special.
[53:21.800 --> 53:25.280]  Before I tell you about that, I just have to say this.
[53:25.280 --> 53:32.920]  What we've been able to do with your support at infowarstore.com is beyond miraculous, seriously.
[53:32.920 --> 53:36.640]  And in fact, it's so miraculous.
[53:36.640 --> 53:41.720]  We've got other projects that we're working on that we're trying to basically shoot the
[53:41.720 --> 53:46.680]  moon on or, you know, jump out of a skyscraper without a parachute and plan on landing on
[53:46.680 --> 53:47.680]  our feet.
[53:47.680 --> 53:49.360]  But you know what?
[53:49.360 --> 53:53.360]  I just put full faith in God and this creation.

[54:44.720 --> 54:50.640]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist
[54:50.640 --> 54:55.040]  Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[54:55.040 --> 55:00.480]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[55:00.480 --> 55:06.320]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for because the truth is powerful and
[55:06.320 --> 55:08.800]  will defeat them and will smash them.
[55:08.800 --> 55:16.120]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com,
[55:16.120 --> 55:20.400]  Paul Watson site summit.news and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive
[55:20.400 --> 55:27.840]  traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master
[55:27.840 --> 55:30.440]  of our own destinies.
[55:30.440 --> 55:35.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[55:35.200 --> 55:37.320]  a war on our economy.
[55:37.320 --> 55:41.800]  But being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[55:41.800 --> 55:46.240]  So take action or be slaves.
[55:46.240 --> 55:52.380]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile times
[55:52.380 --> 55:56.640]  compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[55:56.640 --> 56:01.920]  We don't appreciate the American way truth, justice, due process, the right to self defense,
[56:01.920 --> 56:05.280]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the
[56:05.280 --> 56:06.280]  world is.
[56:06.280 --> 56:10.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[56:10.960 --> 56:15.280]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[56:15.280 --> 56:20.440]  well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[56:20.440 --> 56:24.680]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly
[56:24.680 --> 56:30.120]  and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that
[56:30.120 --> 56:35.040]  the elites dominate, manipulate and command if you're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[56:35.040 --> 56:41.880]  And that's what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family,
[56:41.880 --> 56:43.360]  against prosperity and against your future.
[56:43.360 --> 56:48.320]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[56:48.320 --> 56:55.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:55.960 --> 56:59.840]  Bandod video presents Real Stable Genius.
[56:59.840 --> 57:06.840]  Today, we salute you, Mr. Mask in the Car Warrer.
[57:06.840 --> 57:15.640]  You go from your bed to your bathroom to your kitchen to your car and that mask never comes
[57:15.640 --> 57:17.040]  off your face.
[57:17.040 --> 57:23.080]  It doesn't matter that you live alone, sleep alone and are alone in your car.
[57:23.080 --> 57:27.640]  You won't spread that deadly virus to yourself.
[57:27.640 --> 57:29.520]  Don't make me quarantine me.
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.680]  If you're told to wear a blindfold or never leave your house, you wouldn't question because
[57:35.680 --> 57:39.840]  you'll always bow to authority.
[57:39.840 --> 57:46.720]  So crack open a nice cold cucklite, Mr. Mask in the Car Warrer and let it sit there and
[57:46.720 --> 57:51.040]  get warm since you can't drink it through your mask.
[57:51.040 --> 57:53.840]  I'm told I'm not thirsty anyway.
[57:53.840 --> 57:56.440]  Cucklite, Austin, Texas.
[57:56.440 --> 57:59.600]  Big shout out to Darren McGreen for putting that together.
[57:59.600 --> 58:04.880]  The crew, Sam, just beautifully played the role of Mr. Mask in the Car Warrer.
[58:04.880 --> 58:06.960]  I don't know who wrote that or was singing that song.
[58:06.960 --> 58:09.080]  I guess he was okay, too.
[58:09.080 --> 58:13.800]  But folks, that video, see, we don't have the power to go viral anymore, but you have
[58:13.800 --> 58:19.120]  the power to make us go viral when you download the clips from Bandod video and share them,
[58:19.120 --> 58:22.680]  of course, probably half this audience is banned on social media, too.
[58:22.680 --> 58:24.760]  The story is at newswars.com.
[58:24.760 --> 58:28.680]  Real stable genius, Mr. Mask in the Car Warrer.
[58:28.680 --> 58:34.040]  And of course, you can download the links on Bandod video to these videos.
[58:34.040 --> 58:39.520]  Guys, what channel on Bandod video is that on so that I can give them the accurate information?
[58:39.520 --> 58:40.520]  Just let me know.
[58:40.520 --> 58:42.320]  We don't have to do it right now, but folks, I'll let you know.
[58:42.320 --> 58:43.920]  You can download that and share it.
[58:43.920 --> 58:44.920]  People are watching it.
[58:44.920 --> 58:45.920]  They love it.
[58:45.920 --> 58:49.400]  This is the kind of stuff that can help defeat the New World Order, a little comedy for you,
[58:49.400 --> 58:51.520]  a little dose of reality, if you will.
[58:51.520 --> 58:57.920]  Speaking of a dose of reality, a liberal Democrat, there it is right there, the war room with
[58:57.920 --> 58:58.920]  Owen Schreuer.
[58:58.920 --> 59:02.680]  Real stable genius, Mr. Mask in the Car Warrer at Bandod.video.
[59:02.680 --> 59:04.240]  You can download that and share it.
[59:04.240 --> 59:06.920]  It's a little dose of reality there.
[59:06.920 --> 59:13.320]  Now, a little dose of reality for a liberal Democrat that goes on Fox News, Marie Harf
[59:13.320 --> 59:15.560]  is her name.
[59:15.560 --> 59:19.840]  And she was on the five today and she got a question that she really couldn't respond
[59:19.840 --> 59:23.760]  to, and it went something like this.
[59:23.760 --> 59:27.120]  May I ask a quick follow-up and then Charlie jump in?
[59:27.120 --> 59:34.240]  So Marie, is there another Republican-led city that is having the kinds of problems
[59:34.240 --> 59:37.160]  that we're seeing in the Democratic-led city?
[59:37.160 --> 59:40.640]  And since I know, well, let me let you answer that.
[59:40.640 --> 59:41.640]  Is there?
[59:41.640 --> 59:46.200]  Well, look, Democrats have been in charge of the big cities in our country for eight
[59:46.200 --> 59:47.200]  months.
[59:47.200 --> 59:48.200]  It's a yes or no question.
[59:48.200 --> 59:49.200]  It's a yes or no question.
[59:49.200 --> 59:50.520]  It's more complicated.
[59:50.520 --> 59:51.920]  It's not binary, Harris.
[59:51.920 --> 59:54.080]  The issue is that Democrats are in charge of most things.
[59:54.080 --> 59:55.080]  No, no, no.
[59:55.080 --> 59:56.080]  It's not a choice.
[59:56.080 --> 59:57.080]  Violence rates have gone up and down.
[59:57.080 --> 1:00:02.080]  Is there a Republican-led city that is having the same type of violent and unrest on its
[1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:06.200]  streets the way that a Democratic-led trail of cities is right now?
[1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:09.920]  There are many parts of this country that are led by Republicans.
[1:00:09.920 --> 1:00:13.320]  There are many parts of this country led by Republicans that have very high levels of
[1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:14.320]  violence.
[1:00:14.320 --> 1:00:16.320]  Do they look like the streets of Portland and Chicago right now?
[1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:29.000]  The streets of Portland didn't look like this until President Trump sent in federal troops
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.160]  who were anonymous.
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:31.400]  They don't have their names on.
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:32.840]  That's what anonymous means.
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:36.120]  And had them arresting people with no due process and rented.
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:43.680]  When you have an S3 marking and you have an S3 marking, it's the same thing.
[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:48.800]  As soon as the Democrats or a liberal progressive are forced to deal with their own reality,
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:51.240]  they just deflect.
[1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:53.400]  That's all they do is they deflect.
[1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:55.240]  She knows that it's, she even admits it.
[1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:58.080]  She's like, well, the Democrats have been in charge of these cities for decades.
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:00:59.080]  Yeah.
[1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:00.440]  That's why all the jobs are leaving.
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:04.040]  That's why violence and crime are up.
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:07.480]  Because the Democrats have been running the cities.
[1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:08.960]  Homelessness up.
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:09.960]  Crime up.
[1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:10.960]  Jobs down.
[1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:11.960]  Wages down.
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:15.800]  And then you simply say, hey, where's an example of a Republican area that this is happening?
[1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:20.760]  Well, the, it's Trump.
[1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:24.360]  Trump did this.
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:29.960]  Seriously, I look, I think Trump made the bad, the wrong move, sending in the feds.
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:32.160]  Let the Democrats burn their own cities, man.
[1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:35.680]  Look, I don't like Washington as much as the next guy.
[1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:39.560]  The feds aren't helping unless you're going to send in the feds or the military to arrest
[1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:45.000]  the deep state criminals in Chicago, in St. Louis, who take Soros money and take Chai
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.320]  Kan money, then don't do Operation Legend.
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:49.640]  That's Operation Legend.
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:52.080]  What you're doing is Operation Get Blamed for Everything.
[1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:55.960]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:59.040]  We'll all tell them to wear masks because they're going to die.
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:02.040]  And then we'll release the pressure for a while and then bring it back and squeeze it
[1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:03.040]  harder and release the kid.
[1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:05.040]  And then we'll be the virtuous second ones.
[1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:09.280]  We'll be the angels even though our lord and master Bill Gates helped fund the whole
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:10.280]  COVID-19.
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:11.280]  Oh.
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:12.280]  No.
[1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:13.280]  Don't seduce me.
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:14.280]  That's right.
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:18.280]  That's the code word for Bill Gates's operation.
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:25.280]  He carries out with his good little buddy, Dr. Fauci, in the surgeon cult.
[1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:29.680]  As you know, for girls, there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:30.680]  the romance novels.
[1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:36.280]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the billionaire, and who else?
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:40.280]  Oh, that's right, there's the surgeon, and then there's one other one.
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:44.280]  And it's so much fun to be ruled over by these psychotic psychopaths.
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:50.280]  It's so good to know that there are masters that are coming to rape us with their inoculations.
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:52.280]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[1:02:52.280 --> 1:03:09.280]  Oh, yeah.
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:18.480]  You know, if Jesus Christ came back today, the liberal Democrat progressives would kill
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:19.480]  him.
[1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:26.480]  In fact, I shouldn't even put that out there, I should just ask, if Jesus came back today,
[1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:30.480]  what do you think the liberal Democrat progressives would do?
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:35.480]  All right, I'm not going to hesitate.
[1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:40.200]  We're going to start taking your calls right now and all the way through till my guest,
[1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:42.720]  Andrew Torba, joins me in an hour.
[1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:48.160]  So I just ask that you skip the pleasantries and get right to your topic.
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:54.160]  Let's start with Jake calling in from Portland, where a lot of this madness is happening and
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:57.160]  has been going on for a while under Democrat control.
[1:03:57.160 --> 1:03:58.160]  Jake, go ahead.
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:01.160]  Hey, how's it going, Owen?
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:07.160]  I just wanted to say, yeah, I mean, it's funny that you brought up a kind of, I don't know,
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:11.320]  don't want to put words in your mouth, but losing hope in Trump and not kind of latching
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:12.320]  on to everything he says.
[1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:16.440]  Well, no, no, no, no, what I asked was, I gave the example of how it used to be, I would
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:22.400]  always stop whatever I was doing to listen to what President Trump said and just it wasn't
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:23.400]  even a conscious thing.
[1:04:23.400 --> 1:04:25.920]  I just realized I stopped doing it this week.
[1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:27.400]  It's like I stopped caring in a way.
[1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:32.680]  So I asked what that represents to you, so you're saying that represents to you losing
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:33.680]  hope in Trump?
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:37.320]  Well, not so much that, but like you said, like it's weird that you brought that up because
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:42.600]  I feel the same way, you know, and it's kind of like the subconscious thing that's happened,
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:44.400]  like I just don't care anymore.
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:48.760]  And, you know, I've been very, very vocal about my support for Trump.
[1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:50.360]  I've supported Trump since the very beginning.
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:53.280]  I worked on his, I volunteered for his campaign.
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:58.320]  First time around, I've been with the Proud Boys for, you know, since 2016 out here in
[1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:03.760]  the Northwest, organizing events and rallies and stuff with Joey Gibson and people out
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:04.760]  here.
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:10.280]  And, you know, I mean, I've been a very active, you know, person in this and it's like, so
[1:05:10.280 --> 1:05:15.600]  for me to now, you know, feel the way that you're feeling a little bit where it's just
[1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:21.080]  like, eh, you know, what, you know, I just, I don't, I have no interest.
[1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:23.240]  Well, and here's the problem.
[1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:27.120]  People like you and I've talked to other Proud Boys as well and some of Trump's biggest supporters
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:32.120]  of which I am at the beginning, they're all feeling the same way.
[1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:37.600]  Women who were really vocal in their support of Trump are even more upset than we are.
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:42.720]  And, you know, by the way, cause I was thinking about this, you know, it's such a shame what
[1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:47.320]  has been done to the Proud Boys because, you know, if I wanted to come on air today
[1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:53.120]  or let's say I wanted to join the Proud Boys, I would immediately be attacked from all these
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:57.160]  lying news publications and they would call me a terrorist and they would say that Proud
[1:05:57.160 --> 1:06:01.760]  Boys are terrorists, a complete lie, a complete lie.
[1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:05.200]  But if I came out today and I said, oh, I'm a leader of Black Lives Matter, I'm a leader
[1:06:05.200 --> 1:06:11.280]  of Antifa, who is literally a murderous gang, then that would be totally accepted.
[1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:17.360]  And so it's just so, it's so sad what they've done to you guys and just good for y'all
[1:06:17.360 --> 1:06:19.800]  for sticking by your guns and not bowing to this.
[1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:21.640]  But no, I think it's sad.
[1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:28.080]  I think it's sad that we kind of just subconsciously, unconsciously have just lost hope in Trump.
[1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:31.520]  If that's what you want to call it, whatever, or disinterested in what he says anymore,
[1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:33.120]  because we're just not getting action.
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:34.120]  Anything else, Jake?
[1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:38.240]  Yeah, well, like you said too, with the Proud Boys thing, it's like, you got a lot of us
[1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:40.880]  kind of standing by, like, what do we do?
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:41.880]  What can we do?
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:44.200]  But it's such dangerous times now.
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:49.680]  I mean, you see people that are being arrested or killed or charges brought against them
[1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:57.360]  for blatantly protecting themselves and their properties as the media and the leftists and
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:02.880]  BLM and Antifa, they are absolutely waiting for people like us to step up and try to do
[1:07:02.880 --> 1:07:07.960]  anything at all so that we, you know, and if, and see, and exactly, and they've already
[1:07:07.960 --> 1:07:12.760]  got their court precedent set with fields and what happened with the Proud Boys in New
[1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:13.760]  York.
[1:07:13.760 --> 1:07:15.880]  They have their Soros lawyers and judges all lined up.
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:17.120]  The whole system is rigged.
[1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:18.120]  And you know what?
[1:07:18.120 --> 1:07:21.160]  Let me, let me just say one other thing, Jake, and thank you for the great call in response
[1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:23.280]  to Jake.
[1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:31.080]  Um, think about, this is just, it's, it's literally just such a joke.
[1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:32.360]  I almost don't want to go there.
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:36.600]  But here's why you'll have, you can come on in, Rob, it's all right.
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:41.600]  Here's why you will have most conservatives and Trump supporters never say anything bad
[1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:49.160]  about President Trump because they're so afraid to eat their own words that they'll never
[1:07:49.160 --> 1:07:51.360]  come out against the president.
[1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:56.440]  Whereas if I come out and I go anti-Trump and I say Trump's the one responsible for
[1:07:56.440 --> 1:08:00.000]  all the destruction, America's going to fall under Trump and then he makes me eat crow
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:03.800]  and saves America, I'm glad.
[1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:08.520]  I'm glad I'm not in this for pride.
[1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:12.160]  I would love it for Trump to make me eat my own words.
[1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:17.280]  You see, most of the Trump supporters and media are cowards because they either rely
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:22.560]  on President Trump for all of their, for all of their breaking news or interviews and they
[1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:27.080]  don't want to, they don't want to feel shamed into eating their own words if, if they say
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:28.720]  something and then he takes action.
[1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:32.440]  They're just cowards.
[1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:34.800]  But I mean, call it as it is, folks.
[1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:36.520]  President Trump said you're going to get sick of winning.
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:38.280]  I'm sick of losing.
[1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.480]  President Trump said he's going to give the country back to us.
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:42.480]  We've never had less control of our country.
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:45.200]  Again, I hope he makes me eat these words.
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:50.120]  I'll be popping bottles, but I'm not going to sit here like a coward and not call it
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:51.120]  like it is.
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:52.120]  All right.
[1:08:52.120 --> 1:08:53.120]  Curtis in Oregon.
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:55.440]  Curtis, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:08:55.440 --> 1:08:56.440]  Go ahead.
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:08:59.760]  Hi, Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:03.880]  The first point I wanted to make to President Trump was that he lost my vote when he resigned
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.840]  the Patriot Act.
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:13.040]  But if he wants to win this election and my vote back, we need to see some major actions
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:20.000]  against the heads of these child trafficking networks and the bankers and everyone responsible
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.160]  for the downfall of America because we know what's happening right now.
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:29.520]  They are sitting there licking their lips, managing this decline, waiting to repo our
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:32.560]  houses, waiting to put us on the street.
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:36.440]  Then they're loving it and we're going to lose everything.
[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:41.000]  And we know they're going to attack voting stations and there's not going to be an election.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:44.480]  They're going to get their way with this mail-in ballot and he is going to lose.
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:45.480]  Yeah.
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:47.520]  And I'm afraid that you're right.
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:52.000]  And if Trump's approach is, oh, well, I want to heal America, hey, look, I get that.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:57.360]  You know, you can try to heal yourself from eating healthy and running and everything.
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:02.240]  But if your leg has gangrene, you got to cut the leg off.
[1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:04.200]  And that's the only way you're going to get healthy.
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:05.200]  You know?
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:07.800]  I mean, folks, we've got a cancer in this country.
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:10.640]  There is a cancer in this country, okay?
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:12.000]  We refuse to accept it.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.200]  We know what it is.
[1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:14.840]  And until it's dealt with, we're in big trouble.
[1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:16.960]  But you bring up the sex trafficking networks.
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:24.240]  Rob Dude just brought this in for me, is developing right now, Epstein floodgates open as judge
[1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:30.560]  rules, explosive docs detailing Gisling Maxwell's sex life in Virginia, Jewfree's defamation
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:32.800]  case be unsealed within a week.
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.240]  Now we'll see if this leaves anything or not.
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:41.440]  Remember Maxwell or someone in Maxwell's camp or somebody claims that Maxwell is going
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:45.680]  to cooperate and she has tapes of top-level business execs and politicians and everything
[1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:49.840]  having sex with underage people and kids.
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:51.040]  We'll see if any of it comes out.
[1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:53.960]  Again, Trump seems to be twiddling his fingers on this.
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:57.600]  I don't understand why, but that's what's going on.
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:10:59.600]  Anything else, Curtis?
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:07.960]  Well, I would say, you know, if we're going to watch the decline of our country, we need
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:12.600]  to manage this decline with the same strategy that the elites usually use.
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:18.520]  We usually mop up all of the country's assets and we're getting to the point where financial
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:21.800]  scorched earth policy is going to be our only option.
[1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:25.600]  You know, it's funny you say that because not myself and other people I'm talking to
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:32.280]  have completely changed their tact as far as like, you know, investments or asset management
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:34.440]  or financial management.
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:36.040]  You just have to at this point.
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:39.120]  And I'm not even saying, I'm not even saying I know which way to go.
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:42.040]  It's just, these are such different times.
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:44.560]  Everything, everyone's approach has to change.
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:48.880]  You're going to have to start placing bets in certain places because it's not business
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:49.880]  as usual right now.
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:51.880]  Curtis, thank you so much for the call.
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:52.880]  All right.
[1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:54.760]  When we come back, I'm going to go right back to your phone calls.
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:57.760]  Folks Christmas in July at infowarstore.com.
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:01.920]  Now look, I'm down to one privacy pocket now.
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:03.960]  So this one will probably be gone tomorrow.
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:06.240]  Some sticky fingers will come in here and take it.
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:11.480]  I'm down to one started this week with four on the desk, but, you know, I'm in pretty
[1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:12.480]  good salesman.
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:14.200]  So I guess the crew is like, Hey, I got to get me one of those.
[1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:15.200]  But folks, here it is.
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:20.440]  The privacy pocket at infowarstore.com, brand new design, by the way, the big complaint
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:22.680]  people have about ferrity enclosures for your cell phone.
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:23.680]  They're thick.
[1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:24.680]  They're bulky.
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:25.680]  They don't fit in a pocket.
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:26.680]  I don't want to wear it around.
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:28.280]  I just, you know, I want the privacy.
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:31.240]  I don't like being tracked and traced, but there's no convenient way to do it.
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:32.960]  This is it.
[1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:36.440]  Paper thin fits in any pocket.
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:38.280]  I can put it in my back gene pocket.
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:40.760]  I can put it in my jacket pocket.
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:47.560]  So convenient, so thin, stops the dangerous radiation, stops the tracking and tracing.
[1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:52.960]  It's the privacy pocket at infowarstore.com fits easily into your pocket.
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:57.440]  Much of the United States bureaucracy, all of Hollywood and most of our media is under
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:12:59.480]  international banking control.
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:04.320]  The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers on record to carry out this
[1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:05.320]  operation.
[1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:10.640]  Now, under the guise of medical security, they're bringing us medical charity.
[1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:15.000]  And we see much of the federal government, the Democrats, the Republicans, all saying,
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:21.080]  except for Trump and a few people, that we need a nationwide force mask mandate to make
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:23.120]  everyone wear a mask.
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:27.040]  Even though just months ago, we had the Surgeon General and others say, don't wear a mask.
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:28.040]  It's all fraud.
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:30.240]  Now they say you must wear a mask.
[1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:31.240]  It's a sign of slavery.
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:32.840]  It's a sign of submission.
[1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:34.920]  I know you as listeners understand that.
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:39.040]  We need sheriffs and county commissures and city councils and others to stand up and say,
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:46.200]  we are sanctuary cities for reality and for state and local sovereignty against the globalist.
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:47.840]  This isn't the federal government taking over.
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:49.920]  It's the UN through the federal government.
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:52.920]  And we as American citizens must say no.
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:54.360]  It's Christmas in July.
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:55.360]  We ran the sale last year.
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:57.360]  It was very, very popular.
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:02.240]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:03.240]  election year.
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:09.160]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:13.480]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting at the top of Betsy Ross
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:14.480]  flag.
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:17.480]  And the shirts are on sale right now and in FullmoreStore.com.
[1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:23.280]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign, having a similar shirt to media called Nazi, which
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:24.280]  of course it isn't.
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:27.280]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and the globalist, well, we're going to make
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:32.080]  sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise our First
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:33.800]  Amendment in the face of these tyrants.
[1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:37.400]  We also have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:42.080]  So whatever great item it is that you want, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:45.760]  on your next order, and at least 50% off across the board.
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:48.920]  Now I'm going to have to end this sale very, very soon because all these products are about
[1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:49.920]  to sell out.
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:56.280]  Just take advantage of it right now at FullmoreStore.com.
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:15:02.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:10.880]  Listen, Deshaun Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Nick Cannon, Ice Cube.
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:14.360]  Man, what the hell are y'all doing?
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:18.080]  Like, y'all want racial equality.
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:19.080]  We all do.
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:25.800]  I don't understand how insulting another group helps our cause.
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:28.720]  The only person called y'all on it was Kareem.
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:35.120]  We can't allow black people to be prejudice also, especially if we're asking for white
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:42.680]  folks to respect us, give us economic opportunity, and things like that.
[1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:49.120]  I'm so disappointed in these men, but I don't understand how you beat hatred with more hatred.
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:54.400]  That stuff should never come up in your vocabulary, and it should never come up in your heart.
[1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:55.840]  I don't understand it.
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:59.440]  I'm never going to accept it, and I'm asking you guys.
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:02.120]  I'm begging you guys, man.
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:03.120]  You guys are famous.
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:04.840]  You got a platform.
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:06.240]  We got to do better, man.
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:07.520]  I won't ally.
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:16.080]  I don't want to alienate anybody, and to take shots at the Jewish race, the white race.
[1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:21.200]  I just don't like it because it's not right, and I had to call them on it because it's
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:23.280]  really been on my heart.
[1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:31.920]  So that's Charles Barkley, former NBA player, Hall of Famer, and hosts many NBA talk shows
[1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:32.920]  on television.
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:34.800]  So it'll be interesting to see.
[1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:40.160]  I won't be tuned in to any of the garbage anymore, but I'd be stunned if this doesn't
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:43.120]  permeate into the basketball talk every day.
[1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:47.680]  I mean, they put Black Lives Matter on the court, so here's the thing.
[1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:49.400]  COVID killed professional sports.
[1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:55.120]  The left is just putting the dead body into the casket and into the grave right now.
[1:16:55.120 --> 1:16:58.440]  So it's really sad.
[1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:04.320]  We've gone from Rick Monday picking up a couple Chicago libtards, burning a flag at Wrigley
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:08.680]  Field, him stopping that from happening and picking it up and getting a wild round of
[1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:12.440]  applause to now it's the players burning the flag.
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:14.400]  Isn't that amazing?
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:16.640]  And you know what?
[1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:19.960]  I should also send this to you, Daria.
[1:17:19.960 --> 1:17:26.880]  There was a Russian former KGB agent in 1983 who did a TV interview.
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:28.320]  I'm going to have to send this to you.
[1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:37.520]  It's so incredible how he lays out the war on America with Chinese propaganda and liberal
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:38.800]  indoctrination.
[1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:46.000]  I mean, literally 1983 warns America, hey, here's what's about to happen.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.640]  It's all happening.
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:49.760]  I guess I collude with Russia now, too.
[1:17:49.760 --> 1:17:52.680]  See, but that's another thing, all the lies about Russia.
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:54.440]  Russia is anti-globalism.
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:56.160]  Russia is anti-petaphilia.
[1:17:56.160 --> 1:17:57.600]  Russia is anti-New World Order.
[1:17:57.600 --> 1:18:02.840]  Russia's not perfect, but they're not in on all the global corruption, pedophilia, sex
[1:18:02.840 --> 1:18:04.000]  stuff.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.680]  And so that's why they demonize Russia, and that's why Russia is another crown jewel.
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:09.120]  Yeah, that's the interview right there.
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:15.400]  We should air that whole thing in some segment today.
[1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:16.400]  I'm going to do that.
[1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:22.000]  And also, we're going to have Bishop Larry Gators on to host the fourth hour, who's going
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:25.960]  to be getting more into the weeds with the Black Lives Matter stuff and race relations
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:26.960]  in this country.
[1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:28.760]  Bishop Larry Gators.
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:31.040]  So that's all coming up on the Alex Jones show.
[1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:33.880]  For now, let me get back to your phone calls.
[1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:34.880]  Baldi.
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:36.760]  Baldi in New York.
[1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:38.400]  Go ahead, Baldi.
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:39.400]  Yes.
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:44.640]  The interview the bishop did the other week was one of the best ones you've had in a while.
[1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:52.640]  So the very first day that President Trump was first briefed on the Wuhan Chinese virus
[1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:58.880]  January 3, Baldi was the first caller into the war room predicting an imminent false
[1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:03.280]  flag pandemic, which will lead to forced inoculation.
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:08.640]  But you cannot have forced inoculation before you have gun confiscation.
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:15.520]  And all through March, I was sounding the trumpet calling it the April Fool's virus.
[1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:18.520]  Now who has been the biggest fool of them all?
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:25.760]  Sadly, President Trump, you have been fooled, you have been deceived, and you continue the
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:29.520]  masquerade because you are afraid to admit that you have been fooled.
[1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:31.360]  But, but wait, Baldi, let me ask you this though.
[1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:32.360]  Let me ask you this.
[1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:33.360]  I remember those calls.
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:35.480]  I mean, we have the most informed audience out there.
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:36.480]  There's no doubt.
[1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:37.680]  But let me ask you this though.
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:41.000]  Do you really think President Trump has been fooled or is he just playing along?
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:46.960]  Because if you remember when all of this first started, he said it's just like the flu.
[1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:48.680]  It's just the common flu.
[1:19:48.680 --> 1:19:49.680]  He said that.
[1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:52.480]  He tweeted that and he was under complete assault for it.
[1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:54.840]  And that's when he backed down and changed his rhetoric.
[1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:58.360]  So do you actually think he's fooled or is he just playing along?
[1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:06.720]  Fool would continue to bring out Dr. Burke, Dr. Fauci, instead of the doctors from Bakersdale,
[1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:11.440]  the hero, the real rock star, or the doctor in Texas.
[1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:15.640]  How come his first briefing back, he did not bring out the doctor in Texas that has been
[1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:16.640]  curing it?
[1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:17.640]  Sure, there is a rainbow.
[1:20:17.640 --> 1:20:19.040]  Yeah, no, that's a great point.
[1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:23.200]  He did sideline Fauci, but why doesn't he bring up his own team of doctors that are
[1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:24.680]  saying, hey, stop the mask.
[1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:25.680]  It doesn't work.
[1:20:25.680 --> 1:20:27.560]  Hey, the COVID is less deadly than the seasonal flu.
[1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:28.760]  Hey, they're faking the digital.
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:30.480]  Hey, I saw what they did in the nursing homes.
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:32.440]  I saw what they did in the hospitals to get more money.
[1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:35.240]  I saw them blow people's lungs out and murder them with ventilators.
[1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:36.240]  Yeah.
[1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:37.240]  How is he doing that?
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:38.240]  That's a great question.
[1:20:38.240 --> 1:20:39.240]  I don't know.
[1:20:39.240 --> 1:20:43.640]  There is a ray of hope, though, when he says that he prefers the cure as opposed to the
[1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:44.640]  vaccination.
[1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:51.000]  The problem is that President Trump constantly wants to win the favor of everybody, but he
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:56.080]  does not understand, or maybe he does now, there's a certain segment that will hate him,
[1:20:56.080 --> 1:21:00.320]  not just because he's Trump, not just because of the media, but also because they're jealous
[1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:01.320]  of him.
[1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:04.920]  It's pure jealousy, but he could turn it around tomorrow.
[1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:09.440]  Like I said, get the bakers, sales doctors on, get the doctor in Texas that's curing
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:10.440]  everybody.
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:11.440]  And I'm not taking credit.
[1:21:11.440 --> 1:21:12.440]  Baldy is not the genius.
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:13.440]  It is the genius.
[1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:18.320]  Like you said, of everybody, the infowars, I've been listening to infowars since 2005.
[1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:22.000]  I would not have half of the knowledge I have if it wasn't for Alex.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:23.720]  So thank you, Alex, wherever you are.
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:24.720]  Thank you.
[1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:25.720]  Always road warrior.
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:26.720]  Oh, and you're the best.
[1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:27.720]  Goodbye.
[1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:28.720]  Thank you, Baldy.
[1:21:28.720 --> 1:21:30.120]  Let's go to Mark in Seattle.
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:31.920]  Mark, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:32.920]  Go ahead.
[1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:40.720]  Yes, I'm watching the situation unfold here in Seattle, obviously down south there in
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:41.720]  Portland.
[1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:47.160]  And I agree with you a hundred percent, Oh, and why send the fed in to make yourself look
[1:21:47.160 --> 1:21:50.920]  like a fool if you're not going to actually dispatch them appropriately?
[1:21:50.920 --> 1:21:58.960]  I mean, the way that I'm seeing it go down is that they're letting in teeth of Black
[1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:05.440]  Lives Matter, the writer just play with them and just absolutely just play into their hands.
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:13.480]  You know, when it comes to these options and as far as Trump is concerned, you know, from
[1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:19.840]  the very beginning, you know, I voted for Trump, you know, and I have been a supporter.
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:27.080]  But, you know, me and my like minded friends, we said from the very beginning that no matter
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:35.520]  what Trump does, you know, whether it's positive or negative, it's up to the people.
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:39.600]  You know, there was a spirit that was also dispatched with all of this, whether it was,
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:42.720]  you know, Trump ignited it.
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:47.680]  When it came to there, there was also a spirit that kind of ignited in the people when it
[1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:52.560]  came, you know, to this movement that we have going on now.
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:58.960]  And you know, you look at the decision that you have, you know, are we going to vote for
[1:22:58.960 --> 1:23:00.320]  Trump or are you going to vote for Biden?
[1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:02.240]  Of course, I'm going to vote for Trump.
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:04.640]  Am I disappointed in his decisions right now?
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:05.640]  Yes.
[1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:10.120]  Am I disappointed in his rhetoric when it comes to COVID in the mask and all that?
[1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:11.120]  Absolutely.
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:15.640]  There's a bunch of stuff that Trump is doing that I'm disappointed in right now.
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:21.000]  But at the end of the day, we still come down to that decision of, I mean, there's no way
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:28.320]  I'm going to vote for Biden, but you know, at the very end of the day, this comes down
[1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:29.320]  to the people.
[1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:32.000]  Well, and here's what it's going to come down to, Mark.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:35.120]  There's going to be Trump supporters that are pissed because he's turned into a politician
[1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:36.800]  saying, oh, look, the economy is great.
[1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:39.720]  Oh, you're so sick of winning when it's not true.
[1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:41.800]  And so they're going to stay home despite him.
[1:23:41.800 --> 1:23:43.760]  And then you're going to have people that just don't want to leave their homes because
[1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:46.200]  they don't want to leave a mask or they're afraid of getting shot or beat up.
[1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:47.200]  They won't go vote.
[1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:51.200]  So, I mean, look, this is a serious situation and all his campaign is boosting his ego.
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:56.480]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:59.880]  You can wear them out to political events, you can trigger it, live darts, but one of
[1:23:59.880 --> 1:24:07.000]  the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:11.280]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:13.200]  you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:17.760]  It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations and contact
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:19.840]  tracing if they're openly announcing.
[1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:21.640]  It's an act of submission.
[1:24:21.640 --> 1:24:25.080]  It's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down.
[1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:28.720]  But a big reason to wear these is then in the stores, when people ask you why you're
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:33.760]  wearing a Halloween mask, say, it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're
[1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:34.760]  wearing.
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:38.600]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:42.200]  So they quote spread COVID-19, they don't protect from it.
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:45.120]  But again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks' faces.
[1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:51.080]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free, they're at cost, infowarstore.com.
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:56.040]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown, the number one reason
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:59.520]  is it serves every one of their purposes.
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:03.960]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:08.240]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, force
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:09.240]  inoculation.
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:17.000]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:23.560]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people
[1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:25.560]  once had by design.
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:30.320]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:35.720]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:41.120]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:47.600]  that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:51.800]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:26:01.320]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:09.080]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:16.080]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:17.080]  in males.
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:23.080]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:27.960]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  Yes.
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:35.320]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:40.360]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:41.880]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:43.920]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:46.840]  Never been a better time than right now.
[1:26:46.840 --> 1:26:54.440]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:27:04.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:34.400]  Alright, let's go right back out to your phone calls.
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:37.600]  We've got Robert in North Carolina lined up ready to go.
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:38.800]  Robert, you're on the air.
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:44.600]  The Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:50.120]  Robert going once, twice, three times, sold.
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:52.400]  Liberal in New York, you're on the air.
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:53.400]  Go ahead.
[1:27:53.400 --> 1:28:02.040]  Hey Owen, I've listened to you over the past two years, dismerging the character of people
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:07.160]  that you call from the left, we call them idiots on such and probably by the actions
[1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:11.520]  on words, they probably do deserve it, but you're on the right specifically yourself
[1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:17.520]  and Alex, with the exception of David Knight, you all have been acting like abused wives.
[1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:23.480]  Donald Trump has been making statements and his actions are the total counter to what
[1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:25.120]  he has said.
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:31.760]  He spoke about red flag laws, but you're calling on him to help you when it comes to censorship,
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:37.000]  but he is now trying to align himself with big corporations like Google to undermine
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:38.640]  the rights of people with it.
[1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:41.800]  Well, now hold on a second, I report on that.
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:43.400]  I mean, I literally report on that.
[1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:46.960]  I literally complained about what you're talking about today.
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:49.880]  Dan Crenshaw, in fact, just sided with Pelosi on red flag laws.
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:53.960]  So, hey, look, I understand what you're saying overall as a point, I guess, why haven't I
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:55.880]  totally abandoned Trump?
[1:28:55.880 --> 1:29:00.040]  But to sit here and act like I don't cover it and say that you listen every day, I mean,
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:02.040]  that's just not true.
[1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:05.400]  Okay, so, and I'm not stating that you don't cover it.
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:09.840]  What I'm stating is that you all are lukewarm and this is something that Alex covers all
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:10.840]  the time.
[1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:11.840]  You can't be lukewarm.
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:14.040]  You have to take a side.
[1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:20.120]  When Trump, you all speak about why isn't Soros being investigated or why hasn't he been
[1:29:20.120 --> 1:29:21.120]  arrested?
[1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:27.480]  And when you take a look into the history of his organization or foundation, they are
[1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:32.440]  always paired with the NAD, which is the National Endowment for Democracy, and that's a CIA
[1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:33.440]  run front.
[1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:37.160]  They are always participating in color revolutions all over the world.
[1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:42.040]  And you all expect the same guy that's backing these organizations to come on a system on
[1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:46.480]  age oil, which is why I call you abuse wise there.
[1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:52.480]  You all have this unrealistic expectation that somehow his words will certainly mirror
[1:29:52.480 --> 1:29:55.360]  his actions and his actions haven't done so.
[1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:59.560]  He spoke about not wanting vaccines when he first came in, and I know he's a proponent
[1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:00.560]  for vaccines.
[1:30:00.560 --> 1:30:01.560]  I mean, I don't understand.
[1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:04.440]  I understand what you're saying, but you're just repeating what I've said.
[1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:08.960]  I've literally said everything you're saying on the air, so I don't know what your point
[1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:09.960]  is.
[1:30:09.960 --> 1:30:11.840]  I mean, what's your political ideology?
[1:30:11.840 --> 1:30:13.160]  Where are you coming from?
[1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:20.600]  Well, to be quite honest, I do call myself a liberal, but I am unbiased as of now.
[1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:23.960]  I have seen over the years that I've lived in this country.
[1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:29.200]  I've seen both political parties participate in a specific agenda that has moved on.
[1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:35.640]  They have given their followers the football topics to play with and fight over it while
[1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:37.680]  the main agendas have kept pushing.
[1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:42.600]  Okay, so let me ask you another question then, because I actually appreciate this conversation.
[1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:46.880]  And we may have different political ideologies or whatever.
[1:30:46.880 --> 1:30:49.040]  I like being able to talk to somebody that thinks differently.
[1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:53.760]  I like someone calling in and legitimately challenging me on my ideas and not just screaming
[1:30:53.760 --> 1:30:55.680]  obscenities or calling me curse names.
[1:30:55.680 --> 1:31:00.000]  So I appreciate what you're saying, liberal, but let me ask you this then, because I completely
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  get it.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  You're right.
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  I'm a fool.
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  Trump's fooled us all.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.400]  Why should I have hope in Trump?
[1:31:06.400 --> 1:31:07.840]  But let me ask you this then.
[1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:13.280]  How do you explain how the entire corrupt establishment is against Trump?
[1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:15.320]  How do you explain that?
[1:31:15.320 --> 1:31:21.600]  I see this as theater, and theater for the areas, theater for the masses, and in order
[1:31:21.600 --> 1:31:26.120]  for, and the piece that you were speaking about earlier, what's this guy's name?
[1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:27.120]  Uri Bresmanov.
[1:31:27.120 --> 1:31:30.600]  He speaks about it in that clip that you're talking about.
[1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:35.840]  In order to have society progress, and when I say progress, I'm saying, quote, unquote,
[1:31:35.840 --> 1:31:37.680]  progress, progress to what?
[1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:39.440]  You have to have two opposing forces.
[1:31:39.440 --> 1:31:43.680]  So they have created these two opposing forces, those that are in the Trump camp and those
[1:31:43.680 --> 1:31:47.320]  that are firmly entrenched in the Democratic Party's camp.
[1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:52.640]  But that doesn't really answer my question, and you have to admit, though, I mean, Infowars
[1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:54.520]  has never really been on a side of anything.
[1:31:54.520 --> 1:31:58.160]  I mean, when Republicans were in office, we were known as Bushbashers.
[1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:02.240]  When Obama was in office, you know, we were anti-left, so I mean, Infowars has never really
[1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:03.240]  been on any side.
[1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:05.640]  I guess, you know, we had faith in Trump that he was going to be different.
[1:32:05.640 --> 1:32:07.440]  You say that we're fools for it.
[1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:12.360]  I'll accept that, but that doesn't really answer the question of how is the entire corrupt
[1:32:12.360 --> 1:32:13.480]  establishment against Trump?
[1:32:13.480 --> 1:32:15.400]  Are you saying it's all an act?
[1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:19.520]  Okay, it's psychological, Owen, and if you give me an opportunity, I'll answer it for
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:20.520]  you.
[1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:21.520]  It's psychological.
[1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:27.760]  They have made it seem as if everyone is anti-Trump, and what that does now is personally
[1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:32.480]  solidify his base, like, wow, everyone is against him, so you know what?
[1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:33.480]  But that's what I'm saying, though.
[1:32:33.480 --> 1:32:34.480]  You use that word.
[1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:35.480]  But hold on a second.
[1:32:35.480 --> 1:32:36.480]  You use that word, seem.
[1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:39.360]  So you're saying that, really, Hollywood isn't anti-Trump, really, all the media lying
[1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:42.240]  about him isn't anti-Trump, it's all just an act?
[1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:45.560]  You know what they're anti-Oan, they're anti-Constitution.
[1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:46.560]  That's what all of these people-
[1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:48.960]  Well, I agree with that, and I think they're anti-reality.
[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:54.720]  It's funny you bring up the Constitution, because isn't it funny how we've got all these
[1:32:54.720 --> 1:32:58.600]  people, it's always convenient, like, oh, America's racist, the people that wrote the
[1:32:58.600 --> 1:33:02.640]  Constitution were slave owners, burn it to the ground, remove their statues, and then
[1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:06.840]  all of a sudden when anything happens to them, oh, this is unconstitutional, you're denying
[1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:08.080]  my constitutional rights.
[1:33:08.080 --> 1:33:11.200]  I mean, isn't that hilarious how that's happening on the streets now?
[1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:16.960]  It is hilarious to one, and this is the thing, I don't listen to those idiots whatsoever.
[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:20.640]  When it comes to people like that, and what I really call to talk about, yes, I wanted
[1:33:20.640 --> 1:33:24.280]  to bring up that topic about Trump, but what I've been really wanting to speak about is
[1:33:24.280 --> 1:33:29.720]  Governor Cuomo here in New York, and I'm guessing you guys can pull this information up.
[1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:35.800]  On May 29, 2020, there's a headline in the New York Post titled, Governor Cuomo Delays
[1:33:35.800 --> 1:33:40.160]  Faced to Reopen for New York Regions of Raging Officials.
[1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:45.600]  And the eight paragraph down out of his own mug, Cuomo states that he is taking instructions
[1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:52.760]  from international experts with respect to reopening New York, and I would advise any
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:59.520]  small business owner living in the state of New York to take him to task on this, because
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:04.600]  he's the one responsible for keeping them shut down, not even him, but so-called international
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:09.640]  organization or international experts, and I want people to take him to task for that.
[1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:10.640]  Yeah.
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:11.640]  Yeah, which is globalism.
[1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:13.040]  Hey, liberal, I'd love to give you more time.
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:14.040]  This has been a great call.
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:17.280]  I've just got full lines of people who have been waiting almost an hour, but you know
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:18.280]  what?
[1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:23.680]  I appreciate a caller like this who calls me out on things that he thinks I'm wrong on,
[1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:28.360]  puts me on task with things I've said, and is someone from a different political leaning
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:30.600]  or ideology that can actually have a conversation.
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:33.860]  You see, this is what's missing in America right here.
[1:34:33.860 --> 1:34:39.280]  This is why America can't heal, and I really appreciate you calling in on this, liberal,
[1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:43.400]  and I wish there were more people, whether you're a liberal or a leftist or whatever.
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:48.040]  I wish there were more people like you that were willing to challenge my ideas or challenge
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:51.200]  my words and actually be able to have a conversation.
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:53.640]  This is what's missing, so thank you for the call, liberal.
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:56.520]  Let's go to Isaiah in Ohio.
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:34:58.160]  Isaiah, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:34:58.160 --> 1:34:59.160]  Go ahead.
[1:34:59.160 --> 1:35:02.160]  Hey, how's it going?
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:03.160]  Yeah.
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:14.360]  I want to start off by saying right now, I think we need to have faith and to be speaking
[1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:18.200]  in faith filled words right now into the earth.
[1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:29.000]  The Lord showed me a while back that the world is going to be flooded with his anointing
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.200]  stronger than it's ever been before.
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:43.040]  So just staying positive, because I know it's hard to stay positive with everything that's
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:47.960]  going on and not talk negative, but I think that's a key part.
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:54.960]  It's like the story with Anna Nyus, and it was said in the Bible that the anointing will
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:36:01.480]  be so strong that our shadows will be able to heal the sick.
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:09.720]  But with Anna Nyus, he lied to Peter about selling his property, and he, you know, him
[1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:16.040]  and his wife dropped dead in the power of the Holy Ghost that was on the earth back
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:17.040]  then.
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:19.640]  Well, you know, we got to go to a break here, and I want to just respond to what you said
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:20.640]  about being positive.
[1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:27.320]  I completely agree, and, you know, the challenge is, look, I mean, I'm going to step away
[1:36:27.320 --> 1:36:31.280]  from the mic for a couple days here to try to actually practice what Isaiah just said
[1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:32.280]  being positive.
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:34.040]  Here's the problem.
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:40.200]  You can't go anywhere now without the anti-you, anti-freedom, anti-American propaganda shoved
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:41.640]  in your face.
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:51.640]  The mask, the BLM, all the anti-Trump garbage, so it's hard not to let that upset you.
[1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:56.920]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020, the Democrats, as well
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:37:02.600]  as many Republican leaders, will be calling for the United Nations WHO edict that all
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:09.280]  Americans wear masks, be a, quote, federal order and mandate.
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:13.680]  Really unconstitutional, annihilating states' rights.
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:14.680]  Think about that.
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:16.480]  A woman can kill her baby.
[1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:21.960]  You pay for illegal aliens' health care, but you've got to wear a mask for a virus that
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:27.680]  killed 20-plus times less than what they said, even if you believe the official story.
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:32.920]  This is about the WHO, the globalist, testing their power through the media, over the federal
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:36.360]  government, to set policy in the United States.
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:40.920]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:41.920]  all of it.
[1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:43.200]  And by the way, they admit that.
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:50.520]  They say, now your carbon's down one way or another, you stupid Americans.
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:56.440]  The bad news is, Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:00.840]  Chinese-style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:06.280]  The good news is, they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:11.880]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:14.600]  and will defeat them and will smash them.
[1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:21.960]  And the good news is, there's still sites like Band.Video, NewsWars.com, Infowars.com,
[1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:26.200]  Paul Watson Sites Summit.News, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive
[1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:33.640]  traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master
[1:38:33.640 --> 1:38:36.200]  of our own destinies.
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:41.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:43.160]  a war on our economy.
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:47.640]  But being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:52.040]  So take action or be slaves.
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:59.120]  We are selling more privacy pockets a day than we were previously selling in a month
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:03.080]  because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google
[1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:06.880]  and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones, even if you opt out of it or get rid
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:08.120]  of the apps.
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:13.600]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:18.400]  your life, sharing it with Antifa, sharing it with Black Lives Matter, sharing it with
[1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:22.640]  the deep state to oppress not just high-profile people, but the general public.
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:27.240]  That's why folks are taking back control of their lives with these little Faraday cages
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:31.800]  that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers to ping
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:34.040]  at every few seconds and track your location.
[1:39:34.040 --> 1:39:38.560]  This is the only way to have your privacy and people are taking their privacy back and
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:40.080]  it's very, very exciting.
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:46.040]  They're at $19.95 apiece at infowarstore.com, before even more huge shipments coming in
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:47.040]  next week.
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:50.480]  So get yours now and be part of the movement to cut Big Brother off.
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:40:17.640]  We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water, so make sure that it's always available
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:47.080]  to you.
[1:40:48.040 --> 1:40:54.520]  Other systems just don't compare.
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:41:24.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:37.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, that was Dodger Stadium.
[1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:46.560]  I believe Cubs Dodgers, I think it was 1973 guys fact check me on that Rick Monday entering
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:54.680]  the field of play or leaving the field of play in right field sees a couple of libtards
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:41:59.680]  getting ready to burn a flag in left field and he runs up, scoops up the flag before
[1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:00.680]  he can burn it.
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:07.680]  Vince Scully, the late great, the legend calls it perfectly.
[1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:11.360]  Can you imagine, you know, I want to play that again because listen to this, imagine
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:17.360]  this happens in today's day and age and listen to the response of the crowd when they're
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:20.080]  booing when they burn the flag.
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:26.080]  They cheer when Rick Monday scoops it up and then you have Vince Scully, the legend saying,
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:28.080]  can you imagine burning an American flag?
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:32.720]  Now, just listen to that one more time and think about how far we've come from that.
[1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:33.720]  Here it is again.
[1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:44.560]  I'm not sure what he's doing out there, it looks like he's going to burn a flag and
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:50.600]  Rick Monday runs and takes it away from him and so Monday, I think a guy was going to
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:55.600]  set fire to the American flag, can you imagine that?
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:01.560]  Just beautiful and then the crowd cheers for Rick Monday and they put on the jumbotron
[1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:12.560]  Rick Monday, great play, that was an L.A., he was a Chicago cubby, 1976, wow, probably
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:17.200]  the greatest play in Cubs history right there.
[1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:22.960]  All right, and then Vince Scully, can you imagine burning an American flag, unbelievable.
[1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:26.320]  The average, you know, the average broad, in fact, you know what, I won't even say this,
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:29.720]  I'll be honest because I know a lot of these guys personally, honestly, most of them either
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:32.800]  are politically uninvolved or conservative folks.
[1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:38.520]  In fact, I'll actually be honest with you, I've walked into multiple broadcast booths
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:43.480]  when guys doing their prep work and they're listening to Info Wars and Alex Jones, okay.
[1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:48.360]  So I've also had fisticuffs with some guys in radio booths because they're liberals
[1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:49.360]  and I'm conservative.
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:54.200]  Now it was all in good fun, but man, we are a far cry from that.
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:58.160]  Now you'll probably have an American flag burning ceremony before every game, which
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:00.000]  is essentially the Black Lives Matter ceremony.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.800]  All right, let's go back out to your phone calls.
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:07.000]  By the way, we're going to air coming up before Andrew Torbitt joins me, the former
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.080]  Russian KGB agent.
[1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:12.080]  It's just so, it's just so powerful folks, we'll upload the video on Band Out video
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:13.080]  too.
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:14.080]  We're going to play that coming up.
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:18.040]  Let's go back out to the phone lines for the time being, Austin in Virginia, Austin,
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:19.040]  go ahead.
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:25.760]  Hey Owen, I really love your show, I just wanted to say I used to be an anarchist when
[1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:30.600]  I lived in Denver, I blame half of it on liberal indoctrination, so that's what I want to
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:31.600]  talk about.
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:32.600]  Did you go to Denver, you?
[1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:37.120]  No, no, I didn't go to college just in my interest, it's in the high school, you know,
[1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:40.640]  they teach that we're on stolen land, but what they failed to mention is all the land
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:43.880]  was stolen at one point until capitalism was invented.
[1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:48.880]  But anyways, I wanted to talk about these go fund me, man, because George Floyd, we all
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:49.880]  know what he did.
[1:44:49.880 --> 1:44:55.000]  He solicited individual cigarettes, he committed fraud and resisted arrest, died a criminal,
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:58.680]  he's a millionaire, he's got $20 million in his go fund me.
[1:44:58.680 --> 1:45:01.520]  Not only that, not only that, Austin, I'm glad you brought this up because I was thinking
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:02.520]  about this too.
[1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:08.200]  I mean, look, I really want to get along with everybody, I really want to heal America,
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:11.320]  and I'm thinking like, how do you even talk to a George Floyd protester who really thinks
[1:45:11.320 --> 1:45:13.680]  he was just outright murdered by a police officer?
[1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:19.280]  He was hopped up on drugs, he was committing crimes, he asked them to take them, this all
[1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:24.280]  came out in the transcripts, nobody covered it, Floyd foaming at the mouth on drugs,
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:29.320]  hanging his head against the car window, asked to be removed from the car so he could lay
[1:45:29.320 --> 1:45:30.320]  down.
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:32.440]  I mean, but they don't cover any of that.
[1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:38.640]  And yeah, you're right, they get millions, millions of dollars donated to all their go
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:42.960]  fund me, whether it's Floyd or any of these other people, they just get millions pouring
[1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:43.960]  in.
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:48.800]  So yeah, you know, but it's not just Floyd, it's like, I don't even know how they do
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:49.800]  this.
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:52.360]  It's like literally they set up go fund me and they get millions of dollars overnight.
[1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:58.280]  Yep, I also wanted to mention that Jessica Dodie Whitaker, her go fund me has less than
[1:45:58.280 --> 1:45:59.560]  $100,000 in it.
[1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:02.040]  The white mother who got shot saying all lives matter.
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:03.040]  Yeah.
[1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:04.040]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:08.040]  And the Portland, Oregon Antifa protester or rioter, they should call it bail and bond
[1:46:08.040 --> 1:46:10.440]  fund has almost a million dollars in it.
[1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:12.240]  And I did some, some research.
[1:46:12.240 --> 1:46:17.760]  I looked up some donors, three different names, three different people, all college professors,
[1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:20.800]  one in New York, one in Texas, one in California.
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:24.040]  We see where the money's at, we need to stop this liberal indoctrination because that's
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:25.520]  where the problem's coming from.
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:26.520]  Yeah.
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:32.160]  And see, this is like, these are drastic measures folks, but, and it looks like the money for
[1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:35.800]  Whitaker has actually gone up at least since you checked it's up to 85,000.
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:40.160]  But still, you know, George Floyd, the criminal, you know, he brings in a record amount of
[1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:42.880]  donations for go fund me, but it's all about promotion.
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:47.760]  It's all about the media and how they control the whole thing and have everybody brainwashed.
[1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:50.560]  And then they literally give 10 bucks to George Floyd or whatever, and they think they just
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:51.560]  saved the world.
[1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:52.560]  They feel empowered by it.
[1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:55.520]  They have no idea how they've just been totally deceived.
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:56.520]  Anything else, Austin?
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:46:57.520]  Nope.
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:46:58.520]  That was it.
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:01.160]  We just need to get out there and we need to support the Whitaker family.
[1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:02.840]  They deserve more from us conservatives.
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:03.840]  So that's it.
[1:47:03.840 --> 1:47:04.840]  Really love your show, Owen.
[1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:05.840]  Thank you.
[1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:06.840]  Thank you.
[1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:07.840]  Yeah.
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:08.840]  There is the go fund me right there.
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:11.280]  But, you know, her life doesn't matter.
[1:47:11.280 --> 1:47:16.080]  It's just so sad, folks, I mean, look, I don't know what you do.
[1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:20.920]  I really don't know how you can reason with these George Floyd protesters.
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:23.040]  The simple answer is you can't.
[1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:25.080]  And so I don't know what to do with them.
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:26.480]  They're lost.
[1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:27.480]  They're lost.
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:28.960]  They don't want to be connected to humanity.
[1:47:28.960 --> 1:47:30.680]  They don't want to be connected to reality.
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:32.120]  They don't want to be connected to God.
[1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:34.160]  They're so drunk on hatred.
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:39.520]  They're so under mind control.
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:40.640]  It's a fact, folks.
[1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:47.640]  More black lives have died because of black lives matter than lives that have been saved.
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:50.600]  Tell me one black life that's been saved by black lives matter.
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:52.680]  You can't.
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:48:00.040]  But you've had at least 20 black people dead, killed during a black lives matter riot.
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:02.600]  But then the media covers it all and says it's a peaceful protest.
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:04.560]  I mean, it's sick.
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:05.560]  It's sick.
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:07.200]  And it's all by design, by the way.
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:09.240]  And you know, Alex Jones wasn't the only person that knew it.
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:12.360]  He was just the only one in American media brave enough to report on it.
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:17.880]  But we're going to play up a clip coming up from a 1984 interview with a Russian KGB
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:23.600]  agent that just, I want to play it because, well, I work for Russia, obviously, but no.
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:26.040]  Just because it's so shocking because it just hits home.
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:28.360]  It just makes you realize the attack we're under.
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:29.360]  All right.
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:31.320]  Christine in California, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:32.320]  Go ahead.
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:33.320]  Hi.
[1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:43.320]  Well, regarding Trump's remarks about Maxwell or anybody else, excuse me, his stocking trade,
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:48.760]  part of his way of dealing with people and his career is being charming, okay, which
[1:48:48.760 --> 1:48:49.760]  is disarming.
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:53.920]  And a lot of times you'd be talking about somebody such a wonderful person when he
[1:48:53.920 --> 1:48:57.280]  hires them and stuff, he's fired them a week later.
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:02.080]  And I think it's part of a point, it's also a good way to avoid lining yourself up for
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:05.880]  some libel lawsuit or something.
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:08.880]  But these people have known him a long time.
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:09.880]  He's been around them.
[1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:10.880]  He knows what they're up to.
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:15.680]  And what's her name, Hillary, had reportedly said that if he gets elected, we'll all be
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:16.680]  hung.
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:21.200]  So they know, they know he's not reliable to them.
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:26.080]  Now, he was probably throwing them some bones and appointing those people who were swamp
[1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:28.680]  rats themselves.
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:33.640]  And confusing them or slowing down some decision to try to assassinate him or something.
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:39.880]  But I wouldn't give up on him, but I wouldn't treat him or anybody else as a messiah either.
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:44.760]  But if it is just the usual game where the Democrats are driving a train taking us to
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:50.000]  hell fast and the Republicans driving a train taking us to hell slowly, it's easier to jump
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.360]  off a slower moving train.
[1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:54.920]  So I would still go Trump.
[1:49:54.920 --> 1:50:01.640]  But that's now on the mass, here's the thing, the concept of protect is a very CDC document
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:06.560]  that's quoted and shown on air on your show and probably elsewhere that says that the
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:11.600]  mass don't protect in the same sentence as stop buying them up and leave some for the
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:16.280]  people who need them, the emergency responders and the medical people.
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:22.040]  The thing is the only real protection, which is an absolute thing, is a hazmat suit.
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:25.600]  I mean, a real one, not, I mean, a type for dealing with violars, they're not the sort
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:30.040]  they'll get up to clean and really filthy house.
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:35.520]  So what we're talking about here is partial protection.
[1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:37.520]  And now it's part of the health care flow.
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:39.040]  Well, look, they can protect us all day long.
[1:50:39.040 --> 1:50:41.760]  I mean, they could mandate you wear a condom during sex.
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:42.760]  No, they can't.
[1:50:42.760 --> 1:50:44.440]  Well, it's for protection.
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:47.520]  They could mandate you wear a helmet, you know, during a hail storm.
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:48.760]  Well, no, you can't.
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:49.760]  Well, it's for protection.
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:52.320]  No, it's all about freedom to me.
[1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:56.320]  And for statewide mass mandates to be going into place across the nation is just, it's
[1:50:56.320 --> 1:50:57.320]  just abhorrent.
[1:50:57.320 --> 1:50:59.160]  Thank you for the call, Christine.
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:04.160]  All right, folks, when we come back, we're going to air the video of the former Russian
[1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:06.560]  KGB agent laying it all out perfectly.
[1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:13.480]  It's just, I mean, it just makes it more real and we'll also get Andrew to a brawl.
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:16.600]  But you know, here's the thing about with the Trump deal, folks, this isn't this isn't
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:20.360]  like an ego thing or anything.
[1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:22.320]  It's not trying to take credit away from Trump.
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:26.880]  If it wasn't for this audience and in info wars, Trump would have not made it out of
[1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:27.880]  the RNC.
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:30.920]  He would have not made it out of the Republican nomination process.
[1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:37.560]  So there's just like an added pressure of making sure we do the right thing in these
[1:51:37.560 --> 1:51:40.760]  perilous times.
[1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:46.880]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times
[1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:51.120]  compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:56.480]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self defense,
[1:51:56.480 --> 1:51:59.760]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the
[1:51:59.760 --> 1:52:00.760]  world is.
[1:52:00.760 --> 1:52:05.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[1:52:05.480 --> 1:52:09.800]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:14.960]  well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:19.200]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly
[1:52:19.200 --> 1:52:24.640]  and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:29.560]  the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[1:52:29.560 --> 1:52:35.400]  And that's what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against
[1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:37.800]  your family, against prosperity and against your future.
[1:52:37.800 --> 1:52:40.800]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:48.400]  CNN, USA Today and other Main Street media fake news outlets came out and said that a
[1:52:48.400 --> 1:52:54.960]  new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings standing on top
[1:52:54.960 --> 1:53:01.040]  of an American flag is Nazi and they had the Soros funded Snopes groups and others fact
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:05.520]  check it and say yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazis.
[1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:10.920]  No, George Soros and funds Snopes and Media Matters and the rest of them, he's the real
[1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:15.400]  Nazi collaborator but this shirt I think is really the perfect campaign shirts.
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:18.960]  We make one even better than what Trump's people came up with, two different versions
[1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:24.360]  of it with something even worse, the Betsy Ross flag, our first flag that they also say
[1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:27.240]  is racist even though she was a famous abolitionist.
[1:53:27.240 --> 1:53:32.760]  So these shirts are at infowars.com, they're the American eagle, Betsy Ross flags, two
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:37.200]  different designs, guaranteed to spread the word and of course trigger lip tarts everywhere.
[1:53:37.200 --> 1:53:44.520]  Exercise your first mimic or lose it, infowarsstore.com.
[1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:49.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:49.520 --> 1:53:54.760]  Mr. Besminov was born in 1939 in a suburb of Moscow.
[1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:58.560]  He was the son of a high ranking Soviet Army officer.
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:03.000]  He was educated in the elite schools inside the Soviet Union and became an expert in
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:06.440]  Indian culture and Indian languages.
[1:54:06.440 --> 1:54:11.600]  He had an outstanding career with Novosti which was the, and still is, I should say,
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:17.120]  the press arm or the press agency of the Soviet Union, it turns out that this is also a front
[1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:19.480]  for the KGB.
[1:54:19.480 --> 1:54:25.080]  He escaped to the West in 1970 after becoming totally disgusted with the Soviet system and
[1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:28.000]  he did this at great risk to his life.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:32.680]  He certainly is one of the world's outstanding experts on the subject of Soviet propaganda
[1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:36.040]  and disinformation and active measures.
[1:54:36.040 --> 1:54:41.680]  When you spoke several times before about ideological subversion, that is a phrase that
[1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:44.520]  I'm afraid some Americans don't fully understand.
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:50.640]  When the Soviets use the phrase ideological subversion, what do they mean by that?
[1:54:50.640 --> 1:54:57.160]  Ideological subversion is the slow process which we call either ideological subversion
[1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:04.320]  or active measures, activity in the language of the KGB or psychological warfare.
[1:55:04.320 --> 1:55:12.440]  What it basically means is to change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent
[1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:19.720]  that despite the abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:26.040]  in the interest of defending themselves, their families, their community and their country.
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:35.480]  It's a great brainwashing process which goes very slow and it's divided in four basic stages.
[1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:37.680]  The first one being demoralization.
[1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:41.240]  It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation.
[1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:43.040]  Why that many years?
[1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:48.360]  Because this is the minimum number of years which requires to educate one generation of
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:56.480]  students in the country of your enemy exposed to the ideology of the enemy.
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:01.840]  In other words, Marxism-Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least
[1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:06.480]  three generations of American students without being challenged or counterbalanced by the
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:11.520]  basic values of American patriotism.
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:17.360]  The demoralization process in the United States is basically completed already.
[1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:23.040]  For the last 25 years, actually it's over fulfilled because demoralization now reaches
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:30.600]  such areas where previously not even Comrade Andropov and all his experts would even dream
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:33.320]  of such a tremendous success.
[1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:38.440]  Most of it is done by Americans to Americans, thanks to lack of moral standards.
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:45.320]  As I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter anymore.
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:50.480]  A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information.
[1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:54.200]  The facts tell nothing to him.
[1:56:54.200 --> 1:57:00.560]  Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures.
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:05.200]  Even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him concentration camp, he
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:12.480]  will refuse to believe it until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom.
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:16.400]  When the military boot crashes his balls, then he will understand.
[1:57:16.400 --> 1:57:17.400]  But not before that.
[1:57:17.400 --> 1:57:21.040]  That's the tragic of the situation of demoralization.
[1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:23.680]  The next stage is destabilization.
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:29.320]  This time, subverter does not care about your ideas and the patterns of your consumption.
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:33.240]  Whether you eat junk food and get fat and flabby, it doesn't matter anymore.
[1:57:33.240 --> 1:57:40.040]  This time, and it takes only from two to five years to destabilize a nation, what matters
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:46.000]  is essentials, economy, foreign relations, defense systems.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:53.680]  And you can see it quite clearly that in some areas, in such sensitive areas as defense
[1:57:53.680 --> 1:58:00.960]  and economy, the influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas in the United States is absolutely fantastic.
[1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:06.440]  I could never believe it 14 years ago when I landed in this part of the world that the
[1:58:06.440 --> 1:58:09.600]  process will go that fast.
[1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:11.720]  The next stage, of course, is crisis.
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:16.560]  It may take only up to six weeks to bring a country to the verge of crisis.
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:19.440]  You can see it in Central America now.
[1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:25.280]  And after crisis, with a violent change of power, structure, and economy, you have so-called
[1:58:25.280 --> 1:58:26.280]  the period of demoralization.
[1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:33.960]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have uploaded the full video to band.video from Yuri Benzemov
[1:58:33.960 --> 1:58:34.960]  in 1984.
[1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:38.600]  I mean, no, I play that because I'm a Russian agent.
[1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:43.440]  No, I play that because it's right and it's all happening before our eyes.
[1:58:43.440 --> 1:58:45.600]  And it's time to wake up.
[1:58:45.600 --> 1:58:51.080]  It's Christmas in July.
[1:58:51.080 --> 1:58:52.280]  We ran the sale last year.
[1:58:52.280 --> 1:58:54.080]  It was very, very popular.
[1:58:54.080 --> 1:58:59.000]  And so I am now announcing we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  election year.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:05.920]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:11.600]  It's the American Eagle boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[1:59:11.600 --> 1:59:14.600]  And the shirts are on sale right now in FullerStore.com.
[1:59:14.600 --> 1:59:20.040]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign, having a similar shirt to media called Nazi, which
[1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:21.040]  of course it isn't.
[1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:24.040]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and globalist, well, we're going to make
[1:59:24.040 --> 1:59:28.840]  sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise our First
[1:59:28.840 --> 1:59:30.920]  Amendment in the face of these tyrants.
[1:59:30.920 --> 1:59:34.160]  We also have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[1:59:34.160 --> 1:59:38.840]  So whatever great item it is that you want, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points
[1:59:38.840 --> 1:59:42.680]  on your next order, and at least 50% off across the board.
[1:59:42.680 --> 1:59:45.680]  Now I'm going to have to get this sale very, very soon because all these products are about
[1:59:45.680 --> 1:59:46.680]  to sell out.
[1:59:46.680 --> 2:00:02.880]  Let's take advantage of it right now in FullerStore.com.
[2:00:02.880 --> 2:00:22.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrat Party has been the party of racism for almost 100 years
[2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:24.840]  now, and they're bringing it back.
[2:00:24.840 --> 2:00:28.720]  The Democrats are bringing racism back.
[2:00:28.720 --> 2:00:36.200]  Every in the New York Times podcast coming from the New York Times, nice white parents.
[2:00:36.200 --> 2:00:42.360]  And the entire podcast is about how white people and white parents have destroyed America's
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:44.240]  education system.
[2:00:44.240 --> 2:00:46.080]  Wow.
[2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:48.840]  Talk about just being openly racist.
[2:00:48.840 --> 2:00:53.000]  And again, folks, it's not even about race.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:58.280]  But like, for example, you have Josh Howley, who again today says, still waiting to hear
[2:00:58.280 --> 2:01:03.080]  back from the Smithsonian on the absurd and offensive chart that they released, basically
[2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:09.360]  saying you saw the chart about white heritage and everything, and then they won't tell you
[2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:10.360]  how that got there.
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:12.640]  Well, how did this racism get on the New York Times?
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:13.640]  Here's the thing, though.
[2:01:13.640 --> 2:01:14.640]  It's not even about race.
[2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:17.600]  I mean, you could sit here and make it about race, but if you're going to say that the
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:23.040]  Western education system is designed and made by white people, then you'd have to give them
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:27.560]  credit for the best education system on the planet until the left got in control of it
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:30.040]  and destroyed it.
[2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:36.040]  You can go look in any Democrat run area, just like the violence, you have the degradation
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:42.000]  of education, dilapidated schools, unmotivated teachers.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:43.600]  That's all in Democrat run cities.
[2:01:43.600 --> 2:01:47.760]  You go out to a conservative area, Republican area, and you look at their schools and their
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:49.160]  kids.
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:50.600]  You can make it about race if you want.
[2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:51.600]  It's not.
[2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:57.080]  It's about leadership and ideology, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:01:59.800]  So that's what's going on.
[2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:07.600]  Now, Andrew Torba is with us, of course, the creator of GAB in competition with Twitter
[2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:12.520]  before it was trending, understood the censorship of Twitter was inevitable.
[2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:16.720]  So he created gab.com, dissenter.com.
[2:02:16.720 --> 2:02:22.080]  They also have GAB trends to try to replace where Drudge has failed us.
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:26.320]  Andrew Torba is with us now.
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:33.360]  You know, Andrew, there's so much to talk about the censorship, the attacks on our cities.
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:39.000]  What do you want to get into to start today?
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  This week.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:46.360]  So I don't think people understand just how powerful and influential the search results
[2:02:46.360 --> 2:02:48.120]  are from Google.
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:52.800]  And there are numerous studies out there that show that it absolutely has an impact on election
[2:02:52.800 --> 2:02:53.800]  results.
[2:02:53.800 --> 2:02:56.880]  It sways votes, it sways public opinion.
[2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:01.080]  That video that you played before is really a great example of what is going on today
[2:03:01.080 --> 2:03:06.840]  with big tech where they try to demoralize, they try to eliminate any source of alternative
[2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:10.560]  information like info wars, like GAB, like others.
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:16.240]  So you know, I think it was Monday or Tuesday, I woke up and was running a search for GAB
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:22.360]  and noticed that even if you search for our website, the actual gab.com, you search gab.com
[2:03:22.360 --> 2:03:24.360]  and it would not appear.
[2:03:24.360 --> 2:03:28.720]  So you know, I started searching some other sites too, like info wars, Breitbart, et cetera,
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:30.440]  and none of us appeared.
[2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:36.080]  So this story started breaking and inevitably Josh Hawley and some others covered the story.
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:39.160]  Paul Joseph Watson covered it on Summit News, et cetera.
[2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:43.320]  And then all of a sudden magically, you know, this quote unquote glitch as Google called
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:45.360]  it just suddenly stopped happening.
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:50.280]  So you know, it appears that we've surfaced a new blacklist here of pretty much every
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:57.120]  conservative and alt media company and website on the planet that was just totally blacklisted
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:02.200]  for five or six hours on Monday or Tuesday.
[2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:07.160]  And you know, of course, Google referred to this as a glitch, but this is clearly an internal
[2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:08.160]  blacklist.
[2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:13.280]  There's a couple of articles with former Google engineers who claim that this is likely an
[2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:18.600]  internal blacklist, which it appears that's what it is because, you know, CNN and others,
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:23.240]  you know, we're still appearing in the search results, but Breitbart, Daily Caller, info
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:26.240]  wars, SCAB, we were all totally blacklisted.
[2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:30.680]  You could actually search the exact domain and you wouldn't find the results.
[2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:32.720]  It was, it was really something to see.
[2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:37.320]  And they claim they fixed it, but I don't believe that at all because I went to search
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:43.720]  for the story about the Black Lives Matter supporter kneeling on that baby's neck and
[2:04:43.720 --> 2:04:50.040]  then the, uh, the teacher saying lean in more, kill that baby because it's white and, and
[2:04:50.040 --> 2:04:51.800]  I know that Gateway Punnett covered it.
[2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:53.880]  I know that info wars had a story.
[2:04:53.880 --> 2:04:57.880]  I know that national file had a story and I was just, I was just, I just, you know,
[2:04:57.880 --> 2:05:01.480]  just plugged it into a search engine and I assumed that it would pop up on Google because
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:02.880]  it's exactly their headline.
[2:05:02.880 --> 2:05:03.880]  I know they covered it.
[2:05:03.880 --> 2:05:04.880]  I put in their name.
[2:05:04.880 --> 2:05:05.880]  It didn't show up.
[2:05:05.880 --> 2:05:07.040]  It didn't even show up.
[2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:08.680]  I had to go right to their website to find it.
[2:05:08.680 --> 2:05:13.800]  So ironically enough, what did show up was you've got a bunch of, you know, third party
[2:05:13.800 --> 2:05:20.160]  sites now that are just people making sites that just, uh, republish news basically, um,
[2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:22.320]  and that all still showed up.
[2:05:22.320 --> 2:05:28.700]  So you can clearly tell they, we know this, but they've picked out specific URLs.
[2:05:28.700 --> 2:05:34.240]  They put them on a blacklist and it's all done for political purposes, either run by
[2:05:34.240 --> 2:05:40.600]  China or run by the Democrat party or a, or both, and they've been caught red handed.
[2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:42.600]  And then they just, oh, it's a technical error.
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:43.600]  Yeah.
[2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:45.400]  The technical error is you did it on purpose.
[2:05:45.400 --> 2:05:46.760]  Your technicians did it on purpose.
[2:05:46.760 --> 2:05:48.640]  Your technical errors, you did it on purpose.
[2:05:48.640 --> 2:05:49.640]  Right.
[2:05:49.640 --> 2:05:50.640]  Yeah.
[2:05:50.640 --> 2:05:51.640]  There's, there's no error there.
[2:05:51.640 --> 2:05:55.440]  It's, it's done with intent and it's done to bury stories like that story that you mentioned
[2:05:55.440 --> 2:06:00.160]  and others, uh, from being surface, you know, cause they know people are using Google to
[2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:04.360]  try and find these stories and they make it next to near impossible to find not only the
[2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:08.960]  stories, but also the sites that cover those stories like info wars, um, you know, like
[2:06:08.960 --> 2:06:09.960]  gab.
[2:06:09.960 --> 2:06:15.280]  Uh, and what they do instead is they, you know, prop up the Wikipedia, uh, smear articles
[2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:19.280]  about gab, about info wars, about Breitbart, about others.
[2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:24.580]  So that the only information that you can find is negative information is smeared information.
[2:06:24.580 --> 2:06:27.640]  And then, you know, we go and try to, uh, you know, edit that.
[2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:33.120]  We try to create some form of objectivity on those pages and it's not even us, right?
[2:06:33.120 --> 2:06:35.200]  Our users will go and try and do this.
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:40.240]  And, uh, you know, the pages are camped on by people who openly admit that they are Antifa.
[2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:44.480]  People who openly admit that they are communist and they just sit on the page all day.
[2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:48.500]  They, uh, they have the highest ranks in, in Wikipedia, their Wikipedia admins, their
[2:06:48.500 --> 2:06:50.800]  high level editors, and that's all they do all day.
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:55.000]  They sit there all day and, uh, and camp on the page and don't let anybody change anything
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:58.640]  to be anywhere near any level of objectivity.
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:01.720]  Um, it has to be just totally smeared the whole page.
[2:07:01.720 --> 2:07:05.960]  Um, and you know, that's, that's one of the reasons right now that we're working on improving,
[2:07:05.960 --> 2:07:10.040]  uh, our search because we want people to be able to discover this type of news.
[2:07:10.040 --> 2:07:14.720]  So with gab trends, uh, we've been collecting millions and millions and millions of articles
[2:07:14.720 --> 2:07:16.480]  for the past year and a half.
[2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:21.040]  So we have so much data on news, uh, that we could help surface and help people discover
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:26.480]  that Google is just totally varying from sites like inflores from sites like Breitbart, um,
[2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:29.720]  and from sites like gab where you're, you're not going to find this information anywhere
[2:07:29.720 --> 2:07:33.640]  else just because it's, it's buried and it's, it's hidden from view.
[2:07:33.640 --> 2:07:37.880]  And we have to do a real investigation into Google because I actually did a little, uh,
[2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:39.840]  digging into this last night.
[2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:45.960]  Um, so still in China, Google's technically not allowed in China right now.
[2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:51.120]  Uh, the only search engine that's allowed in China is the official Chinese communist
[2:07:51.120 --> 2:07:52.840]  state search engine.
[2:07:52.840 --> 2:07:56.000]  And so obviously, you know, the control that they have.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:01.160]  And so what's been going on is obviously people have probably heard about Operation
[2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:07.760]  Dragonfly, which is Google trying to build an SEO that would work in China, but it wouldn't
[2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:08.760]  be Google.
[2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:14.240]  It would be called dragonfly, but it seems to me that what Google is actually trying
[2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:20.160]  to do is just bring Google to China and they're just showing China, Hey, look, we can censor
[2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:21.160]  too.
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:22.280]  Hey, look, we know how to censor.
[2:08:22.280 --> 2:08:24.840]  Hey, we can do propaganda as good as anybody else.
[2:08:24.840 --> 2:08:28.240]  Just let us do Google there and forget about dragonfly.
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:31.960]  Now I'm not sure if that's because they don't want to rebrand themselves or if that's because
[2:08:31.960 --> 2:08:36.840]  a, a dragonfly has already been called out on the floor of Congress and they denied it.
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:41.000]  And so then they would just be caught in perjury again, but that's the investigation that
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:42.600]  needs to happen.
[2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:47.920]  What kind of communication is happening between the Chinese Communist and, uh, and, and Sundar
[2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:49.320]  Pichai and Google?
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:50.780]  We know they've lied to Congress.
[2:08:50.780 --> 2:08:54.560]  We know they've lied under oath, but how much involvement are, do they have directly
[2:08:54.560 --> 2:08:58.520]  with China and how much are they catering their search results for China?
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:00.240]  Well, it's probably a lot.
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:06.320]  I mean, you see Google and Apple allowing apps like zoom, allowing apps like TikTok
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:09.760]  to skyrocket to massive success on their app stores.
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:14.440]  And these are basically data mining apps, uh, for the communist Chinese government.
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:15.440]  So you're right.
[2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:19.000]  I think it almost seems like it's a sales pitch, but it's more nefarious than that.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  Right?
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:21.200]  It's, it's more so about the, the election.
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:26.400]  It's about control, controlling the flow of information and obviously retaining the power
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:31.520]  that they have over that flow of information and, uh, over, um, you know, the internet
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:32.520]  in general.
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:35.760]  So it does seem like a sales pitch, but I think it's, it's more obvious than that.
[2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:38.600]  It's just about them retaining control.
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:41.240]  And folks, they really just look at you like cattle.
[2:09:41.240 --> 2:09:43.440]  And so they don't give a damn about you.
[2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:46.960]  That's why they want to get into China because there's three billion more cattle members.
[2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:51.560]  They can rattle up ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller.
[2:09:51.560 --> 2:09:58.720]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as secret 12 for uneven lower price because I signed a huge
[2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:02.000]  multi year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it.
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:05.600]  And my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:07.520]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[2:10:07.520 --> 2:10:09.080]  They're getting great responses.
[2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:13.960]  They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B 12 of this type does
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:16.280]  taken under the tongue where it's more of sortable.
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:21.760]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, help the body produce more
[2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:26.200]  energy, help produce healthy blood cells essential for proper nervous system function
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:27.520]  and so much more.
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:31.440]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basics
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:36.480]  already in your body like vitamin B 12, whether you're old, whether you're young, whether
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:40.160]  you're black, whether you're white, whether you live in Japan or the United States.

[2:11:50.560 --> 2:11:55.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:12:06.080]  Last year, we served over 3 trillion searches, and just as a fact, every single day, 15%
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:10.680]  of the searches Google sees, we have never seen them before.
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:18.080]  So this is working at scale, and we don't manually intervene on any particular search
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:19.080]  result.
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:29.680]  Oh, that is called perjury, jail, arrest immediately.
[2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:33.760]  He's a pretender, all right.
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:40.000]  You know, this is what's so frustrating.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:45.600]  All I do is stand on the capital grounds with my mouth taped, and I spent 27 hours in a
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:47.560]  jail cell.
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:56.360]  That multi-millionaire, foreign operative Chinese communist wangsucker gets up there
[2:12:56.360 --> 2:13:02.080]  and commits perjury, and not a single law enforcement officer, not a single Department
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:10.600]  of Justice official even blinks their eyes, pathetic, pathetic.
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:12.080]  That right there, that's a crime.
[2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:13.160]  You get arrested.
[2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:15.040]  You get your hands cuffed.
[2:13:15.040 --> 2:13:17.440]  You get 27 hours overnight in a jail.
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:23.560]  You get full punishment of the law, but soon our Pachai gets up there and colludes with
[2:13:23.560 --> 2:13:32.320]  the Chinese Communist, lies under oath, censors people politically, and nothing, and nothing.
[2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:33.800]  I'm sick of this crap, man.
[2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:34.800]  All right, I'm sorry for yelling.
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:35.800]  I promised I wouldn't.
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:36.800]  I'm sorry.
[2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:37.800]  I really am.
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:38.800]  Excuse me.
[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:39.800]  Let me take a deep breath.
[2:13:39.800 --> 2:13:47.400]  Andrew Torbos with us, and you just had Zach Voorhees report, and he's since not necessarily
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:52.120]  redacted it, but I think he's more onto something than he realizes.
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:58.520]  Google removing the custom search option where you can custom search by date.
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:02.600]  Now, apparently Google still has this, but you can't do it on all platforms now.
[2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:06.880]  I predict Google will remove this, and here's why.
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:10.120]  If you're somebody like me, and I'm sure Andrew, you've probably done this before.
[2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:14.160]  Whenever you're researching certain topics and certain news and information, you have
[2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:22.280]  to use the custom search bar to find certain things based off date is the key one.
[2:14:22.280 --> 2:14:26.800]  Because so much propaganda just gets stacked up and stacked up and stacked up on a story,
[2:14:26.800 --> 2:14:31.920]  you have to go back in time and remove all of that fat to find the original content.
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:38.800]  So of course Google would want to do that as kind of a time eraser, and I do predict
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:42.600]  if they haven't fully done that yet, I do think they will do that in the near future,
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:43.600]  Andrew.
[2:14:43.600 --> 2:14:44.600]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:48.280]  Yeah, and again, this is one of the reasons why we're working so hard on improving our
[2:14:48.280 --> 2:14:51.840]  search results right now specifically for this reason.
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:58.000]  So we want you to be able to go back in time, say of June of 2019 and search the word Trump.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:02.920]  What was being talked about with that specific keyword at that specific point in time?
[2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:04.360]  For research purposes, it is.
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:07.640]  It's crucial, and what they want to do is they want to bury the past, and they want
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:13.920]  to rewrite it, and they want to force their narratives about what happened and how it happened
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:16.400]  and when it happened and why it happened.
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:19.480]  So I wouldn't be surprised if they removed that either, and that's why they're making
[2:15:19.480 --> 2:15:24.880]  it more and more difficult to find information from sources that aren't CNN from sources
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:30.280]  that aren't MSNBC from sources that aren't, you know, communist infested Wikipedia.
[2:15:30.280 --> 2:15:31.880]  This stuff is going to continue.
[2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:34.800]  It's Alex said it best 20 years ago, right?
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:35.920]  It's a war for your mind.
[2:15:35.920 --> 2:15:41.560]  It's an information war, and right now they're winning, but we can fight back just like we're
[2:15:41.560 --> 2:15:44.760]  doing a gap just like you guys are doing an info wars.
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:50.320]  We have to refuse to give in and to submit to their will, and the only way we're going
[2:15:50.320 --> 2:15:54.840]  to do that is by building and by, you know, fighting back against these narratives and
[2:15:54.840 --> 2:15:59.040]  calling them out and exposing this stuff so that people know what's going on because most
[2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:01.480]  people, you know, you and I are in this day to day.
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:05.320]  So we see this stuff going on constantly, and we try to keep people informed on what's
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:06.320]  happening.
[2:16:06.320 --> 2:16:09.160]  But most normal people are going about their day, and they don't know that this stuff's
[2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:10.160]  going on.
[2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:14.600]  And then they run a Google search and, you know, they just get fed this, this mush of
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:18.880]  propaganda and they don't realize why or how it happened because it really wasn't always
[2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:19.880]  like this.
[2:16:19.880 --> 2:16:23.400]  It just started getting this way really when Trump came along and started turning everything
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:24.400]  on its head.
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:30.200]  So I think it's going to continue, but, you know, there is hope and there is a way forward
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:34.480]  and a path forward, and that's by building and that's by calling these people out and
[2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:35.720]  doing something about it.
[2:16:35.720 --> 2:16:40.800]  You know, you mentioned nothing is going on, you know, from Congress, nothing is going
[2:16:40.800 --> 2:16:42.480]  on from the DOJ.
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:47.960]  There's a great article in the American conservative the other day that basically highlighted the
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:53.000]  money flow and the people flow where people are going back and forth between Silicon Valley,
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:54.560]  D.C. and Beijing.
[2:16:54.560 --> 2:16:59.160]  So you have this conservative ink to big tech pipeline is the name of the article.
[2:16:59.160 --> 2:17:03.200]  And it just outlines how all of these people from conservative ink are working with big
[2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:08.200]  tech in certain ways with lobbying and then working with Beijing for companies like TikTok
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:12.560]  to defend the Chinese as a, you know, we're talking about banning TikTok, which would
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:15.520]  be fantastic and a very smart idea.
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:16.520]  There's the article there.
[2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:17.520]  It's a great article.
[2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:18.520]  I recommend everybody check it out.
[2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:22.480]  And it basically highlights, you know, why is nothing being done?
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:25.000]  Why is Congress doing nothing about this?
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:27.120]  Why is the DOJ doing nothing about this?
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:28.840]  Well, it's, it comes down to money.
[2:17:28.840 --> 2:17:32.680]  It comes down to money, you know, they're funneling people and they're funneling money
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:37.040]  back and forth between D.C. between Silicon Valley and between Beijing.
[2:17:37.040 --> 2:17:40.840]  So until something is done about that, I don't think this is going to stop and I don't think
[2:17:40.840 --> 2:17:44.960]  we're going to see any action out of Congress or any action on the DOJ.
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:49.960]  And anything that we do see is really just Kabuki theater, nothing, nothing's really
[2:17:49.960 --> 2:17:50.960]  going to happen.
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:54.040]  We see these anti-trust investigations and all this and, you know, maybe Google will
[2:17:54.040 --> 2:17:58.000]  get a slap on the wrist, maybe a nice big fine, but it's not going to stop them from
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:17:59.640]  doing what they're doing.
[2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:03.760]  So, you know, until the money flow stops, you know, I don't think anything's really
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:08.000]  going to change on the government side of this, but in the free market, you know, people
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:12.480]  like us and people like you are doing something about it by just being an alternative voice
[2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:15.040]  and speaking some sanity to the madness.
[2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:16.040]  Yeah.
[2:18:16.040 --> 2:18:19.120]  And I mean, look, I'm not going to, I guess I'll do a little teaser.
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:24.000]  I mean, I'm looking on starting up a new project too and just like not even doing savings
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:27.600]  anymore, just like hitting the gas, doubling down like we need as many battleships in this
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:29.000]  war as possible.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  But I'll just stop right there.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:35.280]  You know, but it's actually worse than that, Andrew, because I remember, this had to be
[2:18:35.280 --> 2:18:39.120]  back in March or April and I was reading a story, it was similar to that.
[2:18:39.120 --> 2:18:44.880]  But it was about how in January, and you're aware of this, you just covered it, it was
[2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:50.720]  in the article, Apple and Google and Nike and some of these other companies.
[2:18:50.720 --> 2:18:51.720]  But Apple was the worst.
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:18:56.280]  I think it was like, Apple sends like 57 people a day to and from China.
[2:18:56.280 --> 2:18:59.240]  And then it was like Google has a little less than Nike only had a couple.
[2:18:59.240 --> 2:19:05.160]  But the point is, these corporations that really work out of China, they just operate
[2:19:05.160 --> 2:19:10.400]  under the American flag, but really it's the Chinese flag that's controlling them.
[2:19:10.400 --> 2:19:16.840]  They stop those executive flights in January.
[2:19:16.840 --> 2:19:18.000]  Now why am I telling you this?
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  Why is this significant?
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:22.560]  Folks, they knew about the COVID hoax coming.
[2:19:22.560 --> 2:19:23.560]  They knew.
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:24.680]  They knew it, Apple.
[2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:25.760]  They knew it, Google.
[2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:27.000]  They knew it, Nike.
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:29.120]  Why did they stop their flights?
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:34.400]  Why did they stop sending their executives before it all even came out?
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:36.560]  That needs to be investigated.
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:42.000]  I mean, so it's just, I mean, it's just a crime on top of crime on type of crime.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:44.320]  I think you nailed it, right?
[2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:49.120]  These are foreign entities that are operating as American corporations.
[2:19:49.120 --> 2:19:53.080]  Now, they may be American on paper, right?
[2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:58.560]  They may be a C Corp in the United States of America, but they are more or less controlled
[2:19:58.560 --> 2:20:00.560]  by the communist Chinese.
[2:20:00.560 --> 2:20:04.320]  You look at Reddit, which just accepted hundreds of millions of dollars in investment dollars
[2:20:04.320 --> 2:20:05.320]  from Tencent.
[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:06.800]  You know, these, these companies.
[2:20:06.800 --> 2:20:07.800]  Oh yeah.
[2:20:07.800 --> 2:20:08.800]  And then what happened?
[2:20:08.800 --> 2:20:09.800]  The Donald gets banned.
[2:20:09.800 --> 2:20:10.800]  Right.
[2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:11.800]  Exactly.
[2:20:11.800 --> 2:20:12.800]  Exactly.
[2:20:12.800 --> 2:20:15.000]  I mean, it's the same thing that we're seeing with Twitter, you know, banning quote, unquote
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:20.600]  Q and ons, you know, it's gaslighting to ban patriots and to ban supporters of the president.
[2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:21.600]  That's, that's all it is.
[2:20:21.600 --> 2:20:23.720]  Here's what I'm going to do when we come back.
[2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:24.720]  This is so great.
[2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:30.320]  Uh, this conversation with Andrew Torbo and it just hit an electricity memory in my head
[2:20:30.320 --> 2:20:33.600]  that this is folks, I'm going to break it all down.
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:35.920]  What this really is when we come back.
[2:20:35.920 --> 2:20:40.000]  But you know, all these leftists and liberals complaining about slave owners, I got news
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  for you.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:43.440]  The modern day slave owners are at Apple and Nike.
[2:20:43.440 --> 2:20:45.600]  I'm going to break this down when we get back.
[2:20:45.600 --> 2:20:50.360]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs
[2:20:50.360 --> 2:20:53.920]  with changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress.
[2:20:53.920 --> 2:20:58.480]  You may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals
[2:20:58.480 --> 2:20:59.480]  needed daily.
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:05.280]  That's why infowars life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula, the new platinum
[2:21:05.280 --> 2:21:08.680]  standard of advanced multivitamin formulation.

[2:21:13.440 --> 2:21:16.440]  body the tools it needs to support your body.

[2:21:45.720 --> 2:21:49.440]  There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up to the new world order and global
[2:21:49.440 --> 2:21:50.440]  government.
[2:21:50.440 --> 2:21:53.280]  But one of the biggest is privacy pouches.
[2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:56.240]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years.
[2:21:56.240 --> 2:21:58.360]  In the old days, they weren't 100% effective.
[2:21:58.360 --> 2:21:59.360]  Now they are.
[2:21:59.360 --> 2:22:03.520]  They're a little bitty, lightweight, fairer day cages that small phones and even large
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:07.640]  cell phones fit into very, very comfortably and then slip right into your pocket.
[2:22:07.640 --> 2:22:09.400]  These things work great that way.
[2:22:09.400 --> 2:22:14.040]  You're not tracked, you're not traced by government, by big corporations, by big tech, by hackers,
[2:22:14.040 --> 2:22:15.040]  by criminals.
[2:22:15.040 --> 2:22:16.040]  They're selling your data.
[2:22:16.040 --> 2:22:17.600]  They're using it against you.
[2:22:17.600 --> 2:22:21.040]  AI uses this to be able to predict the future of manipulate markets.
[2:22:21.040 --> 2:22:24.720]  It's critical that everyone stop going around with your cell phones being naked.
[2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:27.880]  Well, I got to tell you, normally we probably sold a couple hundred a month.
[2:22:27.880 --> 2:22:32.680]  We're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day, plus we have a good unit and it's also
[2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:33.680]  a good price.
[2:22:33.680 --> 2:22:35.120]  We have it in four different colors.
[2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:38.440]  It's the privacy pockets at infowarstore.com.
[2:22:38.440 --> 2:22:39.440]  People are really waking up.
[2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:43.560]  I'm seeing it all over the news that folks are aware of this and are now using these.
[2:22:43.560 --> 2:22:45.560]  Get yours at infowarstore.com.
[2:22:45.560 --> 2:22:50.320]  Cool that under the mega-opolis technocracy plan, things are going to be so incredibly
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:57.240]  fair and wonderful because at all seeing all loving computer that doesn't discriminate
[2:22:57.240 --> 2:23:02.240]  is going to decide who gets what resources, who gets what jobs, but in reality it's building
[2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:10.000]  a post-human world so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged,
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:14.840]  distracted, atomized, and then slowly killed.
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:17.600]  This is the brave new world.
[2:23:17.600 --> 2:23:19.200]  It's the post-human world.
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:24.840]  It's the dreaming of the post-human world, the wired magazine and the Wall Street Journal.
[2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:25.840]  All tell us about it.
[2:23:25.840 --> 2:23:29.440]  Oh, now they tell us our smart phones don't just track our every move.
[2:23:29.440 --> 2:23:35.000]  They're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:40.920]  You see the bear trap closed on our leg now and the vampire walked out of the bushes and
[2:23:40.920 --> 2:23:49.040]  is explaining to us how he's slowly going to bleed us and destroy us.
[2:23:49.040 --> 2:24:05.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:05.400 --> 2:24:08.280]  You know, the crew here is just so spectacular.
[2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:14.000]  I mean, they're met with an impossible task every day, which is trying to be as quick
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:19.760]  on the computer as my mind is and most of the time they have success.
[2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:23.520]  Now, I've pretty much put an impossible task in front of them.
[2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:28.840]  There was an old article written and I forget the author's name and it talked about the
[2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:35.400]  truth of the Civil War, aside from the fake news at the time, coverage of it making up
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:36.400]  things.
[2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:37.400]  Oh, it's not about slavery.
[2:24:37.400 --> 2:24:38.400]  Oh, it's not about this.
[2:24:38.400 --> 2:24:39.400]  Oh, robbery.
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:40.400]  Is this or that?
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:45.760]  In a very succinct, two-page story, he kind of lays it out all truthfully about why Robert
[2:24:45.760 --> 2:24:51.200]  Lee joined the Confederacy and why the Civil War was really fought and how really, say
[2:24:51.200 --> 2:24:55.400]  what you went about Robert Lee, that may be it, guys.
[2:24:55.400 --> 2:24:57.000]  Who's the article writer there?
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:25:00.720]  Do you know or that that's probably not even it actually.
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:03.760]  That's from an official museum anyway.
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:11.800]  The point is the author of the article points out how all this spin about the Civil War
[2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:16.200]  and why Lincoln was in it or all of this stuff, it's all BS, it was all about slavery at the
[2:25:16.200 --> 2:25:17.200]  end of the day.
[2:25:17.200 --> 2:25:23.280]  Yes, there were side issues, but really it was Democrats in the South didn't want you
[2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:26.360]  to take their property, their slaves.
[2:25:26.360 --> 2:25:29.560]  That's really what it came down to, folks.
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:31.560]  And it's highlighted so perfectly in this article.
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:33.000]  I wish I could remember who wrote it.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:34.400]  It's okay if you don't find it, guys.
[2:25:34.400 --> 2:25:42.560]  But my point is this, just like the Civil War was about Democrats not wanting to give
[2:25:42.560 --> 2:25:47.480]  up their slaves, then it's the exact same thing today.
[2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:53.520]  Now it's not really fair to say it's the Democrats versus the Republicans.
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:25:58.480]  It's really more about large corporations and they just happen to donate to the Democrats
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:02.920]  because the Democrats are the ones colluding with China more so than the Republicans.
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:12.240]  But just like it was Democrats in the South that fought to keep their slaves in the Civil
[2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:14.800]  War, that's exactly what's going on now, folks.
[2:26:14.800 --> 2:26:15.800]  It's just different.
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:18.040]  Here's what it is.
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:26.920]  All these major corporations have slave labor in China, period, period.
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:33.440]  Now Republicans have gone along with this too, but as far as the political workings are concerned,
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:36.840]  it's all being orchestrated by the Democrat Party.
[2:26:36.840 --> 2:26:38.120]  They're the ones voting for it.
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:39.520]  They're the ones fighting for it.
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:43.720]  So just like Democrats went to a war with America to keep their slaves during the Civil
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:46.480]  War, they're doing it again.
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:50.800]  The only difference is their slaves are in China.
[2:26:50.800 --> 2:26:58.520]  So Apple and Nike and Google and all these huge corporations worth trillions of dollars,
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:04.000]  they know they have slave labor in China that keeps them rich.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:10.560]  They know that Trump is trying to stop this from happening and going worldwide.
[2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:15.280]  So that's why all of these people are lined up against Trump like they were against Lincoln
[2:27:15.280 --> 2:27:19.840]  in the Civil War with the fake news and the Democrats.
[2:27:19.840 --> 2:27:23.920]  As Lincoln said, these are free men.
[2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:26.200]  You don't get to own slaves.
[2:27:26.200 --> 2:27:28.760]  And then again, there was all kinds of things stacked on top of it.
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:29.760]  Oh, it's for the union.
[2:27:29.760 --> 2:27:30.760]  Oh, it's for this folks.
[2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:31.760]  Let's be real.
[2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:32.840]  It was really mostly about slavery.
[2:27:32.840 --> 2:27:34.760]  It's the same thing today.
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:36.760]  It's the same thing today.
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:38.960]  Apple wants their Chinese slaves.
[2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:41.240]  Nike wants their Chinese slaves.
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:49.440]  Google wants their Chinese slaves and they want that 3 billion heard a cattle as a money
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:52.520]  block to continue to get more rich and powerful.
[2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:54.040]  So that's what it is, folks.
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:56.000]  That's what this comes down to.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:00.960]  At the end of the day, they all want their Chinese slaves.
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:05.580]  And that's why they're fighting like hell against America to keep their slaves.
[2:28:05.580 --> 2:28:10.120]  So just like Democrats in the Civil War fought to keep their slaves, the globalists are fighting
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:13.760]  to keep their slaves in China right now.
[2:28:13.760 --> 2:28:17.560]  Andrew Torbott from GAB with me from one more segment.
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:21.240]  Would you like to respond to that, Andrew, or make any final statements here?
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:22.240]  Yeah.
[2:28:22.240 --> 2:28:23.560]  And I think it's actually twofold, right?
[2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:28.600]  So they have actual slaves in China, like real people that are slaving away for next
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:29.600]  to nothing.
[2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:34.240]  And in some cases, nothing, which is why these trillion dollar companies exist in the first
[2:28:34.240 --> 2:28:35.240]  place.
[2:28:35.240 --> 2:28:37.080]  But then we're also slaves, right?
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:38.240]  We're also their slaves.
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:43.400]  We're their data slaves, you know, all of us that are using these big tech products.
[2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:44.600]  We are their product.
[2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:46.600]  We are giving them the information.
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:48.960]  We are making them billions of dollars.
[2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:54.000]  So you know, that's how we can control the situation one person at a time here is by
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:55.840]  waking up to that fact.
[2:28:55.840 --> 2:28:59.000]  The fact is that they are data mining all of us.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:02.360]  We are their mind slaves as long as we continue to use these products.
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:05.840]  And that's one of the reasons why I deleted GAB's Twitter account.
[2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:09.280]  We weren't banned or if people thought we were banned, I deleted it personally because
[2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:11.560]  I didn't want to be a part of that matrix anymore.
[2:29:11.560 --> 2:29:15.380]  I didn't want my mind to be enslaved to Twitter system anymore.
[2:29:15.380 --> 2:29:19.440]  So I opted out of that system and that's why I'm only exclusively on GAB right now.
[2:29:19.440 --> 2:29:22.040]  So I think, you know, it's, it's two fold, right?
[2:29:22.040 --> 2:29:26.720]  Again, we have real actual slaves that are their slave labor's force, but then in a way,
[2:29:26.720 --> 2:29:28.560]  we're also their slaves too.
[2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:29.560]  We're their data slaves.
[2:29:29.560 --> 2:29:33.320]  And until we wake up to that fact, you know, it's going to continue to happen and they're
[2:29:33.320 --> 2:29:34.320]  going to be used.
[2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:38.560]  No, no, no, let's go in on that because, because some people might not understand this.
[2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:43.320]  The data that we're giving them is what they use to make money in marketing.
[2:29:43.320 --> 2:29:45.320]  And they say, oh, here's what people are looking at.
[2:29:45.320 --> 2:29:46.320]  Here's what people are interested in.
[2:29:46.320 --> 2:29:47.760]  Here's where people are traveling.
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:51.760]  And then they sell that data to these marketing research firms.
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:55.240]  So, so I just kind of want to crystallize that for people to understand.
[2:29:55.240 --> 2:29:59.600]  They take all this data and then they use it for marketing purposes and they make billions.
[2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:00.600]  Right.
[2:30:00.600 --> 2:30:01.600]  Exactly.
[2:30:01.600 --> 2:30:05.440]  So, you know, as you're using Facebook, as you're using Twitter, as you're using Google,
[2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:08.920]  they are tracking every click, everything you search, everything you type, everything
[2:30:08.920 --> 2:30:10.840]  you say through your microphone, right?
[2:30:10.840 --> 2:30:13.760]  Your camera roll, everything is being tracked.
[2:30:13.760 --> 2:30:19.720]  That data is then being used and sold to advertisers and to marketers and to big data firms, which
[2:30:19.720 --> 2:30:23.000]  is how Facebook and Twitter and Google make all of their money.
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:28.400]  So we are their product, our information, what we're talking about, what we're sharing,
[2:30:28.400 --> 2:30:32.720]  all of these things go into this big data pool that they then turn around and sell access
[2:30:32.720 --> 2:30:35.880]  to and make billions of dollars on.
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:38.640]  So, you know, in a way, again, we are their slaves too.
[2:30:38.640 --> 2:30:41.120]  And the only way to stop that, we have control over it.
[2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:42.120]  That's the thing.
[2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:43.120]  We have control over it.
[2:30:43.120 --> 2:30:47.520]  There's a Pew study that came out saying 72% of Americans believe that social media companies
[2:30:47.520 --> 2:30:49.200]  hold too much power in politics.
[2:30:49.200 --> 2:30:54.200]  Well, 72% of people understand this and most people understand that they're being tracked.
[2:30:54.200 --> 2:30:56.760]  Most people understand that they are the product being sold.
[2:30:56.760 --> 2:30:59.840]  Why do we continue to use these products?
[2:30:59.840 --> 2:31:01.040]  That's the big question here.
[2:31:01.040 --> 2:31:04.760]  Why do we continue to allow ourselves to be enslaved to these companies and to make these
[2:31:04.760 --> 2:31:08.920]  companies billions of dollars, which they then turn around and use against us and use
[2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:13.800]  against our country and use against, you know, our freedoms to destroy them and annihilate
[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:15.760]  them and further enslave us.
[2:31:15.760 --> 2:31:21.160]  Not just enslave our minds, but now enslave our bodies and enslave us as people in this
[2:31:21.160 --> 2:31:25.320]  country when they take over completely, which is what we don't want to see happen.
[2:31:25.320 --> 2:31:29.880]  So the first step in preventing that from happening is to opt out of their matrix and
[2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:33.440]  to stop being mind slaves to these people and to stop making them money.
[2:31:33.440 --> 2:31:39.120]  And, you know, here's the thing about Kanye West is he takes really deep intellectual
[2:31:39.120 --> 2:31:42.320]  thoughts from his mind and then just lays it out in a phrase.
[2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:46.960]  And so people can't get it and maybe he just doesn't want to fully explain it or he can't
[2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:47.960]  put it into words.
[2:31:47.960 --> 2:31:51.840]  But when he said slavery is a choice, this is exactly what he's talking about.
[2:31:51.840 --> 2:31:54.760]  But to answer the question, you know, why do Americans do it?
[2:31:54.760 --> 2:31:56.560]  Well, it's so trendy.
[2:31:56.560 --> 2:31:57.560]  It's so trendy, right?
[2:31:57.560 --> 2:31:59.440]  I mean, the elites have been saying it forever.
[2:31:59.440 --> 2:32:02.680]  We will make Americans want to be slaves.
[2:32:02.680 --> 2:32:04.200]  Oh, I have to be on the Twitter.
[2:32:04.200 --> 2:32:05.200]  I have to be on this.
[2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:06.560]  I have to get that dopamine hit.
[2:32:06.560 --> 2:32:11.080]  So it's it's been designed and the Facebook, one of the creators came out and said, yeah,
[2:32:11.080 --> 2:32:14.600]  we designed it to make it addictive so that you need it.
[2:32:14.600 --> 2:32:17.280]  And then you are desperate to be our slave.
[2:32:17.280 --> 2:32:18.280]  Right.
[2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:19.280]  Exactly.
[2:32:19.280 --> 2:32:24.280]  But what you'll find is that when you free yourself, you have less anxiety.
[2:32:24.280 --> 2:32:25.800]  You have less stress.
[2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:28.280]  You can focus more time on your family.
[2:32:28.280 --> 2:32:29.280]  I've been reading more.
[2:32:29.280 --> 2:32:30.400]  I've been writing more.
[2:32:30.400 --> 2:32:34.320]  I've been spending more time with my daughter and with my wife.
[2:32:34.320 --> 2:32:37.160]  These are the things that we should be doing with our time, and these are the things they
[2:32:37.160 --> 2:32:38.920]  don't want us doing with our time.
[2:32:38.920 --> 2:32:43.440]  They want us sitting there all day, you know, refreshing the feeds and checking our notifications
[2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:48.200]  and getting those dopamine hits and staying controlled because they feed us.
[2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:52.640]  They decide what information we're allowed to see and what we're not allowed to see.
[2:32:52.640 --> 2:32:55.600]  And who's allowed to have a voice and who isn't.
[2:32:55.600 --> 2:32:56.760]  So that's where they want you.
[2:32:56.760 --> 2:33:00.640]  They want you in this little box on Twitter where they can control what information you
[2:33:00.640 --> 2:33:05.080]  have access to and who you're allowed to talk to and what you're allowed to say.
[2:33:05.080 --> 2:33:06.080]  That's where they want you.
[2:33:06.080 --> 2:33:10.760]  And when you break free from that mind prison and you come out into the real world or you
[2:33:10.760 --> 2:33:16.280]  go to, you know, other sites like Gab where you can speak freely without having to worry
[2:33:16.280 --> 2:33:20.480]  about these big tech tyrants deciding what you can say and what you can't, it's a whole
[2:33:20.480 --> 2:33:21.480]  new world.
[2:33:21.480 --> 2:33:25.160]  And you're free to think and you're free to do other things that you didn't have the
[2:33:25.160 --> 2:33:28.680]  ability to do when you were stuck in that mind prison.
[2:33:28.680 --> 2:33:32.680]  Andrew Torba, dissenter.com, gab.com.
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:33.880]  Andrew, a pleasure as always.
[2:33:33.880 --> 2:33:36.320]  Thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:36.320 --> 2:33:37.320]  Thanks for having me.
[2:33:37.320 --> 2:33:40.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to have a news blitz and a couple of phone
[2:33:40.360 --> 2:33:45.240]  calls when we come back.
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:54.760]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:34:02.520]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality specifically
[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:09.560]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[2:34:09.560 --> 2:34:10.560]  in males.
[2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:16.520]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[2:34:16.520 --> 2:34:21.240]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:34:21.240 --> 2:34:22.240]  Yes.
[2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:28.720]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[2:34:28.720 --> 2:34:33.920]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:35.320]  So what are you waiting for?
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:37.360]  Go to the Info War Store.
[2:34:37.360 --> 2:34:40.320]  Never been a better time than right now.
[2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:44.680]  Super male vitality at Info War Store.com.
[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:48.320]  Another part of the Great Awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:53.880]  religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches
[2:34:53.880 --> 2:35:00.040]  have been burned in Europe and the U.S. Hundreds of Christian icons have been burned, destroyed.
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:03.880]  Jesus has had their heads cut off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all
[2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:04.880]  over Europe.
[2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:08.520]  Virgin Mary's are getting torn down, I mean crosses are being torn down.
[2:35:08.520 --> 2:35:13.320]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real.
[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:19.000]  It is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  and now it's emerged.
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:23.200]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:26.960]  I'm praying for America, I'm praying for you and I know the power of prayer is real
[2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:27.960]  and God hears it.
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:32.640]  We need to come together and pray for even greater awakening, pray for Donald Trump
[2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:38.160]  to be protected, pray for him to win in a landslide and pray for the people under deception
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:41.400]  of the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:42.400]  God bless you all.
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:44.160]  We hope for you to offer him thorns as well.
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:49.640]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[2:35:49.640 --> 2:35:51.960]  You can wear them out to political events.
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:57.200]  You can trigger it, Lib Darts, but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:03.440]  starter at any costume party or at Halloween, but on top of that, they admit that wearing
[2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:07.320]  these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:11.980]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and
[2:36:11.980 --> 2:36:16.200]  racing, if they're openly announcing it, it's an active submission. It's an active
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:20.760]  like putting a burka on your head and bowing down. But a big reason to wear these is then
[2:36:20.760 --> 2:36:25.000]  in the stores, when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask, say it's just as
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:31.200]  useless as the stupid cloth masks that you're wearing. And the M95 mask only control what's
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:36.280]  coming in, not what's going out. So they quote spread COVID-19, they don't protect from it.
[2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:39.720]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control freak spaces. You buy one
[2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:44.720]  for 9.95, you get four more free. They're at cost infowarstore.com.
[2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:50.340]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment. Cell phones are an
[2:36:50.340 --> 2:36:55.920]  amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld. But big tech, large corporations,
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:00.960]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS especially, are using this to
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:05.780]  steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to
[2:37:05.780 --> 2:37:10.400]  scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:17.200]  happen in mass movements. Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:22.480]  their AI takeover. In their own words, they admit it. So I've been selling privacy pouches
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:26.120]  and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade. And now the units have
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:30.040]  gotten really lightweight. They're Faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope.
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:34.680]  They work absolutely great. And it just gives you that security to have power over your
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:39.160]  data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:48.160]  know what you're up to because it's other business. Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:38:01.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:09.880]  Okay, final segment for me here. Bishop Larry Gators is going to be taking over. Is he going
[2:38:09.880 --> 2:38:17.200]  to be taking over at, right at two guys? Absolutely. So he's going to be breaking it down a lot
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:22.040]  of the cultural stuff developing. People really loved the segment he had on the Alex Jones
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:26.720]  show. Was it a week or so? So we brought him back for the fourth hour. It's going to be
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:31.200]  a week. Can't miss. Harrison Smith filling in for me on the war room. I'm going to probably
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:38.040]  pop in on the first segment or two just to make a couple statements. Let me just hit
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:42.200]  some of this news, folks, before we go to the calls. If you're not on the line yet, just
[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:46.080]  don't bother calling. We've got three callers. Guys, just we'll get to those three and that
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:55.240]  will be it. Look at how big of a joke this is. And you know, I like to get along with
[2:38:55.240 --> 2:39:02.960]  people and I tend to forget that most people are weaklings and weak minded and weak foundations.
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:08.320]  But I'm sorry, I just have to call it like it is. And boy, Brad Parscale is really an
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:15.400]  embarrassment. I mean, this guy, this is sad, Brad. He puts this tweet up today. I talked
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:19.320]  to a police officer day. He said a child was shot and killed in Florida. The child had
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:24.920]  COVID after blood testing. He was marked as a COVID deaths. If this is true, this madness
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:35.360]  must stop. Brad paging Brad earth to Brad. This has been going on for months, bro. And
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:40.520]  the news organization you claim to have never heard of info wars has been breaking this
[2:39:40.520 --> 2:39:48.280]  and fighting this for months. Now you know why you got fired as campaign manager should
[2:39:48.280 --> 2:39:52.360]  have happened months ago. I mean, seriously, dude, you don't know who info wars is and
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:56.520]  you're the head of social media management for the Trump campaign. You're the campaign
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:01.600]  advisor and you don't know they've been faking COVID deaths for months. Dude, what are you
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:10.680]  doing? What are you doing? But let's move on. Andrew Cuomo, you know, you've never met
[2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:17.240]  a bigger criminal ever, I think in a governor's role, the mass murder that he's guilty of,
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:22.720]  the total fraud. He says today there should be a national mask mandate. Hey, jerk, you
[2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:27.840]  were just in Georgia, not wearing a mask. I'm going to stop before I start screaming.
[2:40:27.840 --> 2:40:35.800]  Andrew Cuomo belongs behind bars for the rest of his life. Okay. That's just for the murders
[2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:40.520]  that he committed. Who knows what kind of stuff he's involved in with these sex cults.
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:44.080]  You know Cuomo's in the nix of them cult. You know, he's probably parading around with
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:49.080]  Epstein gals with his little nipple rings, probably puts that, you know, fake cotton
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:52.640]  tip with his brother up his own butt. Excuse me. That's just, you know, that's kind of
[2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:59.560]  guy he is. Sorry. I'm sorry. It's just, this is what these people are folks. Now check
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:09.400]  this out again, info wars next month's news today from the Minneapolis star fired Minneapolis
[2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:15.000]  police officer Derek Chauvin and wife charged with tax crimes. So folks, we told you this
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:19.680]  guy was a crooked cop. He was involved with shady stuff. He was already involved with
[2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:24.320]  Floyd. Who knows what else was going on. If he was dealing drugs or taking cuts, he got
[2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:31.400]  caught with all this money, not paying taxes. Folks, he was a dirty cop. He was he knew Floyd.
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:37.600]  There's something else going on here entirely. But forget about that. It's no big deal. Two
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:42.280]  Italian teams arrested for paying Bitcoin to live stream torture and murder of children
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:49.840]  on dark web. Wow. Joe Biden is being investigated for crimes in Ukraine. I know you know that,
[2:41:49.840 --> 2:41:54.560]  but you know, might as well just remind you. Joe Biden is now back on air talking about
[2:41:54.560 --> 2:42:03.280]  how he likes nurses breathing into his nostrils. Alan Dershowitz debates RFK on mandatory vaccines.
[2:42:03.280 --> 2:42:07.720]  This goes on and on. Remember that assault, that sexual assault that that that libtard
[2:42:07.720 --> 2:42:11.240]  filed against Tucker Carlson. It's already busted. It's already completely fallen apart.
[2:42:11.240 --> 2:42:17.720]  I mean, you people are pathetic. St. Louis prosecutor's office busted altering evidence
[2:42:17.720 --> 2:42:21.640]  in the McCloskey case. They literally got busted. It turns out the pistol that the woman
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:26.720]  was carrying was unoperable and they knew it and they literally went in. You know, this
[2:42:26.720 --> 2:42:33.480]  is how O.J. Simpson got off, right? Oh, but I doubt that the McCloskeys get that same
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:39.400]  treatment in court. Unbelievable, man. When are Americans going to say we are sick and
[2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:42.120]  tired of this? Hey, you know what? Some good news real quick before we come up because we
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:48.240]  are humans. We are pioneers. We are adventurers. Scientists prepare for year long expedition
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:53.200]  to study mysterious blue hole in Florida. Hey, that's kind of cool. We talk about space
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:43:00.720]  all day long. We haven't even seen 98 percent of the ocean yet. So I think that's kind
[2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:09.200]  of cool. All right. Mandolin in Missouri, Mandolin in Missouri. Go ahead.
[2:43:09.200 --> 2:43:16.800]  I would actually like to have a message to Donald Trump. Okay. You know, I've been trying
[2:43:16.800 --> 2:43:22.600]  to get ahold of our public health officials and they keep directing me to like all these
[2:43:22.600 --> 2:43:29.000]  other people. So I'm, I'm a mother of two children. Okay. And when I saw these Black
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:33.800]  Lives Matter people, I don't know if you saw the picture of it, but it was a little white
[2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:42.720]  boy and, and it said BLM now. And that really frustrated me. So I just want to reach out
[2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:48.400]  to Donald Trump and he needs to get all of this under control. He is the president of
[2:43:48.400 --> 2:43:53.880]  the United States. I don't care what else he's doing. He needs to open up this economy
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:58.880]  before it goes down to the ground because I'm hearing all this stuff about 5G. You got
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:07.120]  5Gs on these water towers now. And it just, it blows my mind. And yes, I am very passionate
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:15.240]  about just like you and Alex Jones. And you know, I listen to you guys every single day.
[2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:19.160]  And finally, you know, I'm coming on here and speaking my mind, I've had enough.
[2:44:19.160 --> 2:44:22.640]  Well, let me ask you this, Mandolin, let me ask you this, and I'll be fair, this wasn't
[2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:27.440]  originally my theory. Actually, it was Savage Michael Savage that theorized this a month
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:31.880]  or two ago, but it's completely played out. And I didn't intentionally plan to take this
[2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:37.460]  call from you today. But Michael Savage has been doing this on this radio show that mothers
[2:44:37.460 --> 2:44:42.800]  and conservative mothers that voted Trump are more concerned right now about President
[2:44:42.800 --> 2:44:46.600]  Trump than they ever have been. They're not living in safety. They're living in fear.
[2:44:46.600 --> 2:44:50.600]  They're worried about the economy. They're worried about the schools. Are you in that
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:55.920]  category of specifically American mothers, conservative women that are kind of worried
[2:44:55.920 --> 2:44:56.920]  about Trump?
[2:44:56.920 --> 2:45:00.560]  Yeah. Oh, yes. Like, I feel it in my gut. Like, I feel sick every single day.
[2:45:00.560 --> 2:45:03.080]  See, that's what it is. It's in the gut, isn't it?
[2:45:03.080 --> 2:45:09.760]  That our country and all these stupid people that are going around and terrorizing people,
[2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:14.040]  you know what? Somebody's going to snap. I don't know if it's me. I don't know if it's
[2:45:14.040 --> 2:45:20.200]  you or Elastone. I feel you guys. I am the same exact way. And I don't mean to yell and
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:22.000]  get all upset. It's just it.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:25.840]  No, I hear you, Mandolin. And here's the thing. It's not, it's not going to be us that snaps.
[2:45:25.840 --> 2:45:31.680]  And I'm glad you said that what it's going to be is that it'll be like a James Hodgkinson
[2:45:31.680 --> 2:45:37.400]  who goes out and shoots up a Republican baseball practice, except it'll just be a psychopath
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:42.400]  who goes to one of these things with no political ideology, but just to go murder and cause
[2:45:42.400 --> 2:45:46.680]  chaos and then they'll blame it on Trump. They'll blame it on it. They're setting it
[2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:52.160]  up, folks. They're setting us up. I mean, we're about to walk into a bear trap, but
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:57.040]  it's like the biggest bear trap ever and it snaps you and it cuts your legs off. So we
[2:45:57.040 --> 2:46:00.640]  better be aware of this, Mandolin. I know you are and we are, but I mean, it's time
[2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:05.120]  for America to realize this. Thanks for the call. Jeff in Canada. Jeff in Canada. Go ahead.
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:12.840]  Thanks for taking my call on. For lack of vision, the people perish. And right now Trump
[2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:19.640]  has not got a good vision. He's doing this vaccine kabuki and it's really discouraging
[2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:27.360]  people. He will blow himself up if he gets behind the mandatory vaccine initiative.
[2:46:27.360 --> 2:46:33.520]  What Trump needs to do is a power move of setting up a therapeutic commission and pull
[2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:38.560]  all these doctors even from America and around the world together, sit them down and that
[2:46:38.560 --> 2:46:41.720]  you know what, let me just stop you right there, Jeff, because I just have to disagree
[2:46:41.720 --> 2:46:46.320]  with you. That's just playing into the COVID hoax further. He needs to just bring out a
[2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:51.200]  team that says it's a hoax. It's a hoax. That's what he needs to do. Bring out a team of doctors
[2:46:51.200 --> 2:46:56.640]  that say it's a hoax and then show all the data, show the numbers being rigged, show
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:47:00.920]  the fake tests, show the fake results. I mean, that's what this takes. I mean, here's what
[2:47:00.920 --> 2:47:05.200]  it is. You play with fire, you're going to get burned. And he's been playing with fire
[2:47:05.200 --> 2:47:08.040]  way too long.
[2:47:08.040 --> 2:47:14.640]  Right now though, I think if he would do something like that, it would prick the bubble of fear.
[2:47:14.640 --> 2:47:18.760]  It would pop the mask bubble and it would support the economy. I think the whole kabuki
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:23.640]  is to try and support the economy. But here's to my second point, what Trump needs to do.
[2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:27.360]  Not these teller rallies that he was doing. His rallies have been squashed and he wants
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:32.400]  to hold a bully pulpit right now, but he can't do that because of the COVID. What he needs
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:38.960]  to do is have a White House barbecue once a week or twice a week. Invite the prop, you
[2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:39.960]  know,
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:46.160]  But Jeff, you just said it again. He can't do something because of the COVID. Why? Why?
[2:47:46.160 --> 2:47:50.160]  Why are we allowing COVID to dictate our lives?
[2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:55.600]  I agree, but he's stuck in a bind right now. I think this is his way out. He could do.
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:48:00.080]  I wish I had more time. I'm sorry. We got 30 seconds, Jeff, and I got to let you go.
[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:03.720]  But call back in tomorrow if we take calls. I really do apologize, Jeff. It's just it's
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:07.720]  the same thing. Like I see people saying, Oh, well, Trump's wearing the mask now so
[2:48:07.720 --> 2:48:12.640]  that you can say you can go vote because you can wear a mask. Why? Why are we playing games
[2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:16.960]  with these people? Why are we swallowing fire? This is ridiculous.
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:21.200]  All right, folks, I'm signing off. Bishop Larry Gators takes over. I'm going to make a brief
[2:48:21.200 --> 2:48:25.760]  statement on the war room in an hour. Thanks everybody for tuning in. You stay classy. Info

[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:40.520]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile
[2:48:40.520 --> 2:48:45.240]  times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny. We
[2:48:45.240 --> 2:48:50.560]  don't appreciate the American way. Truth, justice, due process, the right to self defense,
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:54.120]  private property because we've had it so long. We just think that's how the rest of the world
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:48:59.360]  is. Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to
[2:48:59.360 --> 2:49:03.760]  try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:08.120]  as well as the strong is something the West invented. And that's what made our modern
[2:49:08.120 --> 2:49:13.280]  world. That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalist who say humans are ugly
[2:49:13.280 --> 2:49:18.720]  and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that
[2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:23.840]  the elites dominate, manipulate and command even lucky enough to stay alive. And that's
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:30.560]  what COVID-19 is a global UN revolution against free humanity against your family against
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:33.480]  prosperity and against your future. If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:36.280]  you get.
[2:49:36.280 --> 2:49:43.200]  You can't make this stuff up a consortium of the UN WHO, the Bill and Linda Gates Foundation,
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:47.760]  the National Institutes of Health and of course the Clinton Global Initiative headed
[2:49:47.760 --> 2:49:53.560]  up by Chelsea Clinton on the board are in control with Apple and Google with a hidden
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:59.240]  app on all phones that you cannot turn off. The track and trace everywhere you go, they
[2:49:59.240 --> 2:50:04.120]  claim for COVID but of course it's really the Chinese Communist social score rollout.
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:09.640]  These people are sick, filthy criminals and they want total control over society with
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:14.360]  the official global ID system. That's why it's called the Clinton Global Initiative.
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:20.720]  But you can fight back with the privacy pockets at mforestore.com, little Faraday cages, little

[2:50:59.760 --> 2:51:06.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I am your guest host here this afternoon. My name
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:12.400]  is Bishop Larry Gators. I am the host of the nationally and internationally syndicated
[2:51:12.400 --> 2:51:19.600]  radio show Global Spiritual Revolution Radio through the Life Radio Network, 92.9 AM, 1460
[2:51:19.600 --> 2:51:25.720]  AM on Yadav. We're also internationally syndicated through the I Heart Radio Network and the
[2:51:25.720 --> 2:51:32.000]  I Heart Media Group also here in New York City. We are so excited and so very honored
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:40.200]  to be back with you guys for this fourth installment, this fourth hour of the Alex
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:45.840]  Jones show. And just I want to give you guys kind of a preview of a coming attraction that
[2:51:45.840 --> 2:51:53.080]  what we're going to be talking about for the next 15, 20 minutes. The thing that I really
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:52:02.760]  want us to get into this afternoon is the title Kanye West, Harriet Tubman and the Prince
[2:52:02.760 --> 2:52:12.520]  Hall paradigm. Again Kanye West, Harriet Tubman and the Prince Hall paradigm. Now I'm going
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:17.520]  to say something quickly here as we're laying the Schematical Foundation, what we're going
[2:52:17.520 --> 2:52:24.040]  to be talking about in the next segment concerning Kanye West, Harriet Tubman and the Prince
[2:52:24.040 --> 2:52:32.680]  Hall paradigm. What the Bishop is going to reveal to you right now. Kanye West told
[2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:38.840]  the truth. I know this is mind blowing. I know that a lot of you think Kanye West has
[2:52:38.840 --> 2:52:47.600]  lost his mind. Kanye West and people like him, like Dave Chappelle have not lost their
[2:52:47.600 --> 2:52:56.200]  minds. It was not by accident. Okay. The Kanye West said what he said a few days ago, where
[2:52:56.200 --> 2:53:06.880]  in North Charleston, South Carolina, which is the exact geolocation. Okay. The location
[2:53:06.880 --> 2:53:17.040]  going back to June of 1863, where Harriet Tubman, okay, who is proclaimed as the Moses of that
[2:53:17.040 --> 2:53:27.160]  generation. Harriet Tubman was recruited by the Rothschilds through the Northern Military
[2:53:27.160 --> 2:53:35.640]  Industrial Complex to deliver black people out of slavery, not because the North loved
[2:53:35.640 --> 2:53:45.080]  black people, but through Rothschild money, through Albert Pike, through Levi Coffin,
[2:53:45.080 --> 2:53:56.480]  okay, through John Brown. The Rothschilds needed a woman or a man that could lead slaves
[2:53:56.480 --> 2:54:05.400]  out of from the South. For what? In other words, she was instructed to free the slaves
[2:54:05.400 --> 2:54:12.480]  anywhere from 70 to 300. And most of these slaves were engineers. I know this is mind
[2:54:12.480 --> 2:54:16.360]  blowing and a lot of this information that you never heard before. A lot of the slaves
[2:54:16.360 --> 2:54:24.600]  were engineers. They were land surveyors. They were craftsmen. They were brick masons
[2:54:24.600 --> 2:54:33.600]  and brick layers. Most of them not all. So then why would Harriet Tubman free the slaves
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:42.400]  not for the reason that you and I have been taught for the past 100 to 200 years? Harriet
[2:54:42.400 --> 2:54:53.960]  Tubman was a two of the Rothschild dynasty through the Northern Industrial Complex through
[2:54:53.960 --> 2:55:01.160]  their military arm and their financial arm that they needed black engineers and surveyors
[2:55:01.160 --> 2:55:09.600]  to prepare for the oncoming onslaught of the Civil War that started on the 12th of April,
[2:55:09.600 --> 2:55:18.360]  1861 and ended on the 9th of April in 1865. So we're going to go into a quick break. And
[2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:25.240]  when we come back, we're going to be talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman and the Prince
[2:55:25.240 --> 2:55:32.800]  Hall paradigm that is going to absolutely blow your minds. We will see you here in about
[2:55:32.800 --> 2:55:43.920]  two minutes time on the Alex Jones show.
[2:55:43.920 --> 2:55:53.560]  Vicky Gibbs, 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated
[2:55:53.560 --> 2:55:59.120]  and then died. And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch,
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:04.120]  it'll be innovation. We know what's going to happen. It's a blue city, same story yet
[2:56:04.120 --> 2:56:10.240]  again. And they say her heart gave out. If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19
[2:56:10.240 --> 2:56:14.200]  as a death sentence, it's on record when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:18.720]  get killed. Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue states? It's
[2:56:18.720 --> 2:56:23.720]  because they intubate them putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing an
[2:56:23.720 --> 2:56:29.080]  autoimmune response. And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it
[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:35.120]  will kill you. But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:39.720]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading. Don't end up
[2:56:39.720 --> 2:57:07.720]  like Vicky Gibbs or everyone.
[2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:14.460]  The Life Radio Network global spiritual revolution radio through the Life Radio Network, 92.9
[2:57:14.460 --> 2:57:20.520]  FM 1460 AM. And also were internationally syndicated through the I heart radio network
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:25.160]  in the I heart meter here in New York City, New York. Now we've been talking about for
[2:57:25.160 --> 2:57:33.200]  the past five to six minutes, the title Kanye West on here at Tubman in the Prince Hall
[2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:40.560]  era died. Now Kanye West a few days ago was in North Charleston, South Carolina. The exact
[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:48.440]  geographical location back during the month of June in 1863 were here at Tubman, being
[2:57:48.440 --> 2:57:58.800]  backed by the northern military industrial complex to three, hundreds of slaves from
[2:57:58.800 --> 2:58:06.800]  North Charleston, South Carolina. Now Kanye West and Dave Chappelle, these men I call
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:13.880]  patriots because they're leaving the plantation of the Democratic Party. Okay. And anytime
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:20.760]  going back in slavery, okay, here in the Americas and around the world, anytime when a slave
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:29.960]  was talking liberation, was talking emancipation, all of the other slaves were trained by their
[2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:39.800]  slave masters to call that man or woman mentally unstable. So what Kanye West is going through
[2:58:39.800 --> 2:58:45.200]  and what Dave Chappelle went through a few years ago is nothing new as we're talking
[2:58:45.200 --> 2:58:53.640]  about Kanye West, here at Tubman in the Prince Hall paradigm. So to understand why Ken
[2:58:53.640 --> 2:59:01.160]  Kardashian, this witch with 10 wigs, five weeks and three and a half extensions that
[2:59:01.160 --> 2:59:07.040]  she got from a dead horse in this sacrifice into devils, I don't bite my tongue why I
[2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:14.320]  am a contract assassin for the Lord Jesus Christ. So then Kanye West is being thrown
[2:59:14.320 --> 2:59:24.720]  underneath the bus by his wife, Ken Kardashian, and the deep state because Kanye West is
[2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:34.640]  a threat to the demonic order of the left. So then Harriet Tubman was born in 1822 died
[2:59:34.640 --> 2:59:41.960]  in 1913. And going back into the 1700s, it was through Rothschild money and you notice
[2:59:41.960 --> 2:59:51.280]  that photo there of Harriet Tubman. Notice her hands. That is a high ranking Prince
[2:59:51.280 --> 3:00:01.520]  Hall Masonic hand sign. Yes, according to the book Masonic abolitionists, free masonry
[3:00:01.520 --> 3:00:08.080]  and the Underground Railroad in Illinois by Daryl Lamar Andrews, he declared that this
[3:00:08.080 --> 3:00:14.920]  particular hand sign by Harriet Tubman, it represents that not only was she at Prince
[3:00:14.920 --> 3:00:22.080]  Hall Mason in the Prince Hall Masonic order was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
[3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:29.640]  the hometown of Kobe B Bryant during the month of July in 1775, a year before the Declaration
[3:00:29.640 --> 3:00:35.960]  of Independence. And also Philadelphia is the hometown of not only the Prince Hall Masonic
[3:00:35.960 --> 3:00:44.400]  order, but of the blue lay sicker society 88 years later on the 15th of May in 1904.
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:53.840]  As we're talking about Kanye West, okay, being within this Harriet Tubman conspiracy,
[3:00:53.840 --> 3:01:02.080]  which is nothing more than the paradigm of Prince Hall Masonic order. So notice again,
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:08.080]  this book Masonic abolitionists, okay, excellent picture. There's there on ladies and gentlemen,
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:18.560]  so then now one may be asking themselves, Bishop, what is a Prince Hall Mason, a Prince
[3:01:18.560 --> 3:01:29.040]  Hall Mason goes back to the man Prince Hall, who was born in the nation or Barbados, okay,
[3:01:29.040 --> 3:01:38.360]  in the early 1700s. So Prince Hall was the son of a British slave owner, Thomas Prince
[3:01:38.360 --> 3:01:47.560]  Hall, who was an agent for the Rothschild British dynasty. And the mother of Prince
[3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:55.880]  Hall, it was an African American slave or a colored woman who was a slave. So then Prince
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:02:03.960]  Hall created the black skulls and bones, the Prince Hall Masonic order, which would be
[3:02:03.960 --> 3:02:12.120]  the precursor for the upcoming blue lay sicker society, which you and I call Sigma Pi five.
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:18.520]  So then on the 6th of March in 1775 through Rothschild money, and with the backing of
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:27.480]  both the British and the Irish secret societies, Prince Hall created the Prince Hall Masonic
[3:02:27.480 --> 3:02:35.680]  system in Boston, Massachusetts, which was later established in the city of Philadelphia,
[3:02:35.680 --> 3:02:42.800]  Pennsylvania. This is some powerful information. So as we're talking about again, Kanye West
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:53.240]  on Harriet Tubman in the Prince Hall paradigm. So then not only did the Nordram military
[3:02:53.240 --> 3:03:02.640]  in a financial industrial complex chose Harriet Tubman, but also a man by the name of Albert
[3:03:02.640 --> 3:03:13.400]  Pike. Yes, Albert Pike being one of the faces of the Ku Klux Klan. And as a sign note, the
[3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:22.800]  Ku Klux Klan was not created by white people. The Ku Klux Klan was created by a Rothschild
[3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:31.400]  agent, a man by the name of Philip Benjamin Judah, who had hired both Nathan Bedford
[3:03:31.400 --> 3:03:41.880]  Forrest in Albert Pike to be the faces of the Klan. So Hollywood, a Hollywood may be
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:51.360]  a made of a Hollywood has been perpetuating a lie for the past 200 years as we're methodically
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:57.680]  and schematically breaking down for you our students here today concerning Kanye West,
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:04:07.600]  Harriet Tubman in the Prince Hall paradigm. And so there are three levels, okay, of what
[3:04:07.600 --> 3:04:14.120]  I call the redesignment of slavery. And this is what Kanye West is going through. And yes,
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:24.120]  he told the truth. So then there is a three paradigm, a mental sign up of slavery through
[3:04:24.120 --> 3:04:32.880]  the Democratic Party that we are eyewitnessing today. And that is abolition, then the word
[3:04:32.880 --> 3:04:43.240]  manu mission, then the term emancipation. Well, abolitionists like John Brown and Levi
[3:04:43.240 --> 3:04:52.680]  Koffin, they were not friends of black people during their time of systemic enslavement.
[3:04:52.680 --> 3:05:02.160]  This gentleman, John Brown, Levi Koffin, Albert Pike, including a man by the name of Rob Morse,
[3:05:02.160 --> 3:05:13.120]  who was the creator of the Eastern Stars. So Harriet Tubman was not only a Eastern star,
[3:05:13.120 --> 3:05:21.840]  but he was also a Prince Hall Mason that was specifically chosen. And I want you to listen
[3:05:21.840 --> 3:05:31.160]  to this because this is mind blown. She was specifically chosen to emancipate the black
[3:05:31.160 --> 3:05:40.240]  diaspora from the South to the North, not to liberate black people, but to recruit engineers
[3:05:40.240 --> 3:05:50.520]  and land surveyors to help the Northern military and financial industrial complex abolition. So
[3:05:50.520 --> 3:05:59.320]  they sent abolitionists to recruit Harriet Tubman in order to give forth the sigh of what we
[3:05:59.320 --> 3:06:07.840]  call manu mission. And what is manu mission? It means slavery that's been redesigned.
[3:06:07.840 --> 3:06:16.360]  So once you are touched by a abolitionist or chosen, you ought to be redesigned in order
[3:06:16.360 --> 3:06:26.640]  to be emancipated. Though we are free legally, but psychologically and spiritually, people are
[3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:33.320]  only slaves because those people have been redesigned. We will come back here in the
[3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:39.360]  second, in the third segment here on the Alex Jones show with your guest host and moderator,
[3:06:39.360 --> 3:06:52.080]  Bishop Mary Goode. It's the end of the world, as we know it. If the end of the world, as
[3:06:52.080 --> 3:07:06.880]  we know it, if it's the end of the world, as
[3:07:06.880 --> 3:07:11.200]  marshaled by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the
[3:07:11.200 --> 3:07:16.160]  Fortune 100. This is the post-human takeover. The news gets tighter when you
[3:07:16.160 --> 3:07:22.800]  comply, not looser. The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax. Now they admit that
[3:07:22.800 --> 3:07:26.120]  quote death numbers are dropping because those are fake, where they count people
[3:07:26.120 --> 3:07:29.760]  that died of something else, but it's all about how many cases there are and now
[3:07:29.760 --> 3:07:34.400]  they're saying most the population will get it and then no one can go outside
[3:07:34.400 --> 3:07:41.600]  ever again. It's totally insane. It's a fraud. It's all a lie.
[3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:52.400]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[3:07:52.400 --> 3:07:58.400]  Where did it come from?

[3:08:41.600 --> 3:09:00.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:07.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show here with your best open moderator this
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:12.960]  afternoon, Digital Irrigators. We are just talking for you, our patrons all over
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:21.840]  the world, the title of this lecture, which is Kanye West, Harriet Tubman,
[3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:28.320]  and the Prince Hall paradigm. And as a sign note, like I said before we
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:35.040]  went into the last break, that Harriet Tubman was a
[3:09:35.040 --> 3:09:41.840]  Prince Hall mason. Harriet Tubman was also a part of the Eastern
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:49.360]  Stars. And Harriet Tubman, also her bloodline goes
[3:09:49.360 --> 3:09:54.480]  back into Liberia, not just in the past, but even at this very present day,
[3:09:54.480 --> 3:09:59.840]  another topic for another day. And there were 16 Black men along with
[3:09:59.840 --> 3:10:05.920]  Prince Hall who created the Prince Hall masonic order. Oh, why is that number 16
[3:10:05.920 --> 3:10:09.440]  so important? Now remember the last time I was on the
[3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:14.480]  Alex Jones show a couple weeks ago, that according to the West African
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:20.320]  religion, Odu Aifa, which is the biblical spiritual
[3:10:20.320 --> 3:10:27.680]  demonic foundation of the Black Lives movement, it has 16
[3:10:27.680 --> 3:10:34.640]  chapters or 16 stages of demonic contact or possession.
[3:10:34.640 --> 3:10:38.160]  Okay, and at the same time Black Lives matter,
[3:10:38.160 --> 3:10:46.240]  they have 16 chapters. So then you have 16 men who found it on the Prince Hall
[3:10:46.240 --> 3:10:52.480]  masonic order during the month of July in 1775.
[3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:59.520]  And also there are 16 states of demonic possession in the religion called Odu
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:04.320]  Aifa, which is the foundation of the 16 chapters
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:09.600]  of Black Lives matter. And so then as we're talking about Kanye West,
[3:11:09.600 --> 3:11:14.320]  and people like him, and this is the reason why Kanye West is going through
[3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:19.280]  what he's going through, because Kanye West does not want to be a slave
[3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:26.800]  anymore. Okay, and so Harriet Tubman being a high-ranking masonic
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:34.000]  person within both the eastern stars and the Prince Hall masonic order.
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:38.800]  Now later on, for you, our students here today as we're talking about
[3:11:38.800 --> 3:11:43.600]  Harriet Tubman in connection with Kanye West, in connection
[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:49.680]  to the paradigm of what we call the Prince Hall masonic order,
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:54.720]  later Harriet Tubman became a spy. I want you to listen to this.
[3:11:54.720 --> 3:12:01.680]  She became a spy for the North during the advent of the Civil War
[3:12:01.680 --> 3:12:06.720]  from the 12th of April in 1861 to the 9th of April in 1865.
[3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:13.920]  And she had a powerful code name called Sarpakus. Wait a minute now.
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:19.920]  Her code name during the Civil War between 1861 and 1865
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:27.360]  was Sarpakus. And that term Sarpakus means casket or coffin.
[3:12:27.360 --> 3:12:31.680]  I'll come back to that particular term in the next five minutes
[3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:37.840]  as we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman in the Prince Hall
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:43.120]  paradigm. Okay, and so then later a man by the name of Frederick
[3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:48.400]  Douglas who created the African Methodist Episcopal Church
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:52.320]  along with Richard Allen along with Absalom Jones.
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:56.960]  All three of these men were Prince Hall masons.
[3:12:56.960 --> 3:13:03.600]  Notice the letters, African A, then you have Nuthidus M,
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:15.200]  then the term Episcopal E. So the AME church is a front code
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:24.160]  for the terms abolition, manu mission, okay capital M-A-N-U
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:31.920]  mission which means the redesignment of slavery that would give the slave
[3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:39.520]  emancipation capital E. So the African Methodist Episcopal Church
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:44.240]  or the AME church that was birthed in the city of Philadelphia,
[3:13:44.240 --> 3:13:49.040]  Pennsylvania, the hometown of Kobe Bryant, the hometown of the
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:52.480]  Prince Hall Masonic Order, the hometown of the
[3:13:52.480 --> 3:13:57.200]  Boulay Sticker Society was also the birthplace of the
[3:13:57.200 --> 3:14:02.080]  African Methodist Episcopal Church which Frederick
[3:14:02.080 --> 3:14:08.800]  Douglas, Richard Allen, and Absalom Jones were all Prince Hall masons.
[3:14:08.800 --> 3:14:16.240]  So A, abolition, M, manu mission, and emancipation.
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:23.040]  So we're going to send Black people in the South abolitionists like John
[3:14:23.040 --> 3:14:29.680]  Brown and Albert Pike, okay, and Levi Cawthon to bring about the
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:35.840]  liberation of a people that they don't even love in order to
[3:14:35.840 --> 3:14:42.160]  redesign them from being a legal slave to a
[3:14:42.160 --> 3:14:46.880]  psychological slave of redesignment that we call
[3:14:46.880 --> 3:14:52.400]  manu mission that's M in order to emancipate them.
[3:14:52.400 --> 3:14:58.240]  We're not going to emancipate them unless we first
[3:14:58.240 --> 3:15:05.360]  redesign them through manu mission AME. So nothing is by accident
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:09.360]  as we're talking about Kanye West, okay, and
[3:15:09.360 --> 3:15:12.640]  there's so-called, and I know I'm going to get in trouble today,
[3:15:12.640 --> 3:15:17.520]  but Harriet Tubman, what Kanye West was talking about,
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:22.160]  it was absolutely true. I'm going to bring this out in the next 30 seconds.
[3:15:22.160 --> 3:15:29.920]  So there were between 70 and 300 slaves, 60 percent of these slaves were
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:36.400]  engineers, okay. Now Harriet Tubman became a super spy
[3:15:36.400 --> 3:15:41.600]  for the North during the Civil War, and as we move forward here again
[3:15:41.600 --> 3:15:49.520]  abolition A, then we bring manu mission the redesignment of the slave
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:56.000]  in order to emancipate them E, AME, or African Methodist
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:15:59.120]  Episcopal Church. I know a lot of preachers are going to
[3:15:59.120 --> 3:16:03.440]  disagree with me. You see you have to understand students
[3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:10.560]  that slavery has been redesigned. Now during the time
[3:16:10.560 --> 3:16:17.760]  of the Underground Railroad between 1849 to 1863,
[3:16:17.760 --> 3:16:24.480]  this woman who was also a high-ranking worshiper of the religion
[3:16:24.480 --> 3:16:31.840]  of Odu Aifa, Harriet Tubman, made 13 trips, okay, and went through
[3:16:31.840 --> 3:16:36.560]  safe houses that were owned by Prince Hall
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:42.160]  Nations, and she would leave a mark on the wall of these houses
[3:16:42.160 --> 3:16:48.320]  in the form of a compass in the square, a compass in the square. Now remember
[3:16:48.320 --> 3:16:51.120]  during the Civil War, like I said a few minutes ago,
[3:16:51.120 --> 3:16:55.680]  the code name for this spy, Harriet Tubman,
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:17:05.840]  was sarcophus, okay, capital S-A-R-C-O-P-H-A-G-U-S, sarcophus, or
[3:17:05.840 --> 3:17:12.240]  sarcophus, which is a Greek word, signifying casket
[3:17:12.240 --> 3:17:16.880]  or coffin, okay, which also means the words
[3:17:16.880 --> 3:17:22.160]  solve, E-T, collage, okay, when you come back
[3:17:22.160 --> 3:17:26.560]  during after the next break, we're going to break this down even further,
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:30.080]  and I know your minds are being blown right now as we're talking about Kanye
[3:17:30.080 --> 3:17:33.680]  West, Harriet Tubman, and the Prince Hall
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:37.600]  Herodine, here with your host and teacher

[3:21:15.920 --> 3:21:18.640]  through the I Heart Radio Network in the I Heart
[3:21:18.640 --> 3:21:21.120]  Radio Group. Also here in New York City, New York, we
[3:21:21.120 --> 3:21:24.880]  average between 20 to 25 neonealysis each and every week
[3:21:24.880 --> 3:21:29.680]  throughout the world in the 150 countries. We're talking about Kanye West,
[3:21:29.680 --> 3:21:35.280]  Harriet Tubman, this Moses, and the paradigm
[3:21:35.280 --> 3:21:38.800]  of what we call Prince Hall Masonic Order.
[3:21:38.800 --> 3:21:42.960]  Okay, now there's another powerful book I want you guys to
[3:21:42.960 --> 3:21:50.000]  to get into. In title, The Freemasons by Jasper Ridley,
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:56.640]  a history of the world's most powerful secret societies.
[3:21:56.640 --> 3:22:01.040]  The Freemasons by Jasper Ridley, a history
[3:22:01.040 --> 3:22:04.080]  of the world's most powerful secret societies.
[3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:08.480]  He says in chapters 3, 4, and 5 that Harriet Tubman
[3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:15.120]  was actually paid by the northern powers, okay,
[3:22:15.120 --> 3:22:19.840]  during the advent of the Civil War from the 12th of April
[3:22:19.840 --> 3:22:27.040]  in 1861 to the 9th of April of 1865 which is the end of the Civil
[3:22:27.040 --> 3:22:30.960]  War. She was paid by the Northern Financial
[3:22:30.960 --> 3:22:35.760]  In-Military Industrial Complex after the advent of what we call the
[3:22:35.760 --> 3:22:40.320]  Civil War, okay, which was not bought to stop slavery,
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:44.240]  another topic for another day. So, Harriet Tubman was paid
[3:22:44.240 --> 3:22:49.360]  for bringing the slaves from the south to the north which means Kanye West has not
[3:22:49.360 --> 3:22:55.200]  lost his mind. And so, we as Black America, we have been
[3:22:55.200 --> 3:23:01.280]  lied to. We are being played. We are being bamboozled in
[3:23:01.280 --> 3:23:06.080]  lettuce trade but I'm going to expose this today. Why? Because I'm a contract killer
[3:23:06.080 --> 3:23:08.800]  representing the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[3:23:08.800 --> 3:23:12.960]  All right, so the Freemasons by Jasper Ridley, a history of the world's most
[3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:17.440]  powerful secret societies. Excellent picture there that talks
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:24.080]  about this woman by the name, okay, of Harriet Tubman
[3:23:24.080 --> 3:23:32.240]  who had freed hundreds of slaves in North Charleston, South Carolina
[3:23:32.240 --> 3:23:36.960]  during the month of June in 1863, the same geographical location
[3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:41.200]  where my brother Kanye West had exposed
[3:23:41.200 --> 3:23:47.760]  this fallacy called Harriet Tubman, okay. Now, as we move forward here, now we're
[3:23:47.760 --> 3:23:50.240]  going to be talking about, again, Harriet Tubman was a
[3:23:50.240 --> 3:23:54.800]  master spy for the North. Her code name was
[3:23:54.800 --> 3:24:00.960]  Sophicus, okay, capital S-A-R-C-O-P-H-A-G-U-S, which is a
[3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:04.880]  Greek Hellenistic term, students, means it means
[3:24:04.880 --> 3:24:11.680]  coffin or casket. So, the Northern power structure viewed
[3:24:11.680 --> 3:24:18.400]  this woman as a casket and a coffin as we're talking about Kanye
[3:24:18.400 --> 3:24:22.720]  West, Harriet Tubman in the Prince Hall
[3:24:22.720 --> 3:24:27.040]  paradigm, okay. Again, abolition, a
[3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:34.400]  manu-nition, which means that the slaves, though legally they are free,
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:39.120]  but psychologically, emotionally and spiritually,
[3:24:39.120 --> 3:24:44.000]  you're not freed because you're redesigned. They're called free slaves.
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:48.080]  Notice, they're not called free black men, women and children.
[3:24:48.080 --> 3:24:51.680]  They're called free slaves. Watch the wordage.
[3:24:51.680 --> 3:24:57.920]  So, abolition, manu-nition, which is the redesignant of the slave,
[3:24:57.920 --> 3:25:04.320]  before they become emancipated. AME or the African Nephys
[3:25:04.320 --> 3:25:08.640]  Episcopal Church, which is the Trojan horse
[3:25:08.640 --> 3:25:16.240]  for the sign of abolition, manu-nism and emancipation, as we're talking about
[3:25:16.240 --> 3:25:22.400]  Kanye West, okay, on Harriet Tubman in the Prince Hall
[3:25:22.400 --> 3:25:28.480]  paradigm, okay. So, again, notice the letter G in the middle
[3:25:28.480 --> 3:25:36.560]  of the compass in the square, which is a Masonic global symbol.
[3:25:36.560 --> 3:25:42.320]  So, that letter, capital G, within the Masonic order,
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:50.000]  it means geometric, something that is geometry
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:56.320]  of what we call geometry. So, when we're talking about Kanye West,
[3:25:56.320 --> 3:26:00.560]  Harriet Tubman in the Prince Hall paradigm,
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:07.200]  we have to pray for our brother, okay, Kanye West, because
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:14.000]  I got to say this, his life is on the line, okay. His life is on the line.
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:20.560]  So, we got to pray for him, because they're all powers that be in this country
[3:26:20.560 --> 3:26:29.280]  that want to take him out by diagnosing him as schizophrenic,
[3:26:29.280 --> 3:26:35.360]  as post-traumatic stress disordered, as a schizoid,
[3:26:35.360 --> 3:26:41.200]  schizophrenic type of person that is unstable. Allow me to bust your bubble
[3:26:41.200 --> 3:26:45.040]  here today, as we're talking about on Kanye West,
[3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:52.640]  Harriet Tubman, and the paradigm called the Prince Hall Masonic Order.
[3:26:52.640 --> 3:26:57.600]  So, Kanye West decided to leave the Democratic
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:02.160]  Plantation, and by the way, the Democratic Party
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:08.800]  instituted the system of slavery. The Republican Party had
[3:27:08.800 --> 3:27:14.880]  nothing to do with slavery. The GOP had nothing to do with slavery.
[3:27:14.880 --> 3:27:22.240]  So, it was a Rothschild agent by the name, again, an attorney who never
[3:27:22.240 --> 3:27:25.280]  graduated from law school, but his name was
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:32.560]  Judah Philip Benjamin. In July of 1865, in Pulaski, Tennessee, along with
[3:27:32.560 --> 3:27:37.200]  Albert Pike, okay, and Nathan Bedford Forrest,
[3:27:37.200 --> 3:27:40.800]  more specifically Albert Pike, who was one of the so-called
[3:27:40.800 --> 3:27:45.520]  abolitionists that not only chose Harriet Tubman,
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:53.760]  but provided the schematical blueprint of the caves, of the underground
[3:27:53.760 --> 3:27:58.480]  networks, okay, that was created with Rothschild money,
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:02.000]  going back into 1700. How would Harriet Tubman
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:05.680]  know where to go? Because she was financially
[3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:10.320]  backed by the global deep state through the Rothschilds
[3:28:10.320 --> 3:28:14.160]  during this time, just like Black Lives Matter
[3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:19.440]  is being a tool of manipulation. Always remember this, students,
[3:28:19.440 --> 3:28:24.240]  knowing enough about a subject to think you're right, but not enough about the
[3:28:24.240 --> 3:28:28.480]  subject to know you're wrong. So, my assignment today
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:35.440]  is to reveal that Kanye West is not crazy. Kanye West
[3:28:35.440 --> 3:28:41.360]  has not lost his mind. Kanye West is marked for death,
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:48.240]  because anytime a slave thinks about leaving the plantation, and notice the
[3:28:48.240 --> 3:28:55.440]  term plantation, plan or plant. So, a plantational
[3:28:55.440 --> 3:29:01.760]  thinking person is looked upon as an entertainer.
[3:29:01.760 --> 3:29:05.520]  His name is fifty-cent quarter, nickel, penny,
[3:29:05.520 --> 3:29:10.400]  iced tea, ice cube, ice tray, pit bull, little bow-wow.
[3:29:10.400 --> 3:29:15.520]  Notice that term, plantation. It has to have a plan
[3:29:15.520 --> 3:29:21.920]  in order to plant a seed within your psychology.
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:26.240]  And as we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman,
[3:29:26.240 --> 3:29:31.200]  in the Prince Hall paradigm, every blank person
[3:29:31.200 --> 3:29:37.520]  of any financial significance is not only a bully's secret society member,
[3:29:37.520 --> 3:29:41.760]  but they are a Prince Hall Mason, okay?
[3:29:41.760 --> 3:29:47.280]  As we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, and the Prince Hall
[3:29:47.280 --> 3:29:51.760]  paradigm, okay? And this is the reason why
[3:29:51.760 --> 3:29:56.320]  many black people in this nation are not free,
[3:29:56.320 --> 3:30:04.160]  because the demon-craptic party was not designed to liberate black
[3:30:04.160 --> 3:30:09.520]  people. It was designed for you to have a race card
[3:30:09.520 --> 3:30:16.560]  with an unlimited balance in order for you to be kept in victimhood
[3:30:16.560 --> 3:30:23.040]  and self-enslavement as a redesigned slave in order for you to be
[3:30:23.040 --> 3:30:27.280]  emancipated. We're going to take a quick break here and we'll be back here
[3:30:27.280 --> 3:30:30.320]  in the next few minutes as we're talking about Kanye West,
[3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:40.160]  Harriet Tubman, in the Prince Hall paradigm.
[3:30:40.160 --> 3:30:43.440]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news
[3:30:43.440 --> 3:30:47.440]  outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign
[3:30:47.440 --> 3:30:51.120]  t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings
[3:30:51.120 --> 3:30:56.400]  standing on top of an American flag is Nazi, and they had the Soros funded
[3:30:56.400 --> 3:31:00.720]  Snopes groups and others fact-checking to say, yes, now the American flag
[3:31:00.720 --> 3:31:05.200]  and, yes, the American eagle are Nazis. No, George Soros and funds Snopes and
[3:31:05.200 --> 3:31:08.160]  Media Matters, and the rest of them, he's the real
[3:31:08.160 --> 3:31:12.240]  Nazi collaborator. But this shirt, I think, is really the perfect campaign
[3:31:12.240 --> 3:31:14.080]  shirts. We've made one even better than what
[3:31:14.080 --> 3:31:16.800]  Trump's people came up with. Two different versions of it wins
[3:31:16.800 --> 3:31:20.640]  something even worse. The Betsy Ross flag, our first flag,
[3:31:20.640 --> 3:31:24.400]  that they also say is racist, even though she was a famous abolitionist.
[3:31:24.400 --> 3:31:28.400]  So these shirts are at infowars.com. They're the American Eagle,
[3:31:28.400 --> 3:31:32.480]  Betsy Ross flags. Two different designs, guaranteed to spread the word,
[3:31:32.480 --> 3:31:35.600]  and, of course, trigger lip tarts everywhere. Exercise your first amendment,
[3:31:35.600 --> 3:31:40.960]  we're Lucid, infowarsstore.com. We close and lock our doors and windows
[3:31:40.960 --> 3:31:44.480]  at night, not because we're doing anything wrong, but because it's about
[3:31:44.480 --> 3:31:48.560]  privacy and it's about security, and it's something that we do
[3:31:48.560 --> 3:31:52.400]  to protect ourselves going back thousands of years when we would post a dog
[3:31:52.400 --> 3:31:55.520]  or a century in the efforts of the village so we would know if predators
[3:31:55.520 --> 3:31:59.600]  or criminals were coming. Well, big tech, along with the federal government
[3:31:59.600 --> 3:32:03.280]  and other globalist organizations, have been tracking everybody illegally for
[3:32:03.280 --> 3:32:07.040]  years with their cell phones. But now, the public is finally waking up
[3:32:07.040 --> 3:32:10.960]  because the enemy has openly announced it's the fact, and the Clinton Foundation,
[3:32:10.960 --> 3:32:14.960]  Global Initiative with Chelsea is running the private system to spy on you and
[3:32:14.960 --> 3:32:17.360]  your family. That's right, the Democrats, the globalists,
[3:32:17.360 --> 3:32:20.480]  the chai cops, they've all got our number. They're tracking us in
[3:32:20.480 --> 3:32:24.960]  lifetime, but with privacy pockets, the best system at infowarsstore.com,
[3:32:24.960 --> 3:32:28.400]  you can protect yourself and your family by keeping your cell phone in
[3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:31.760]  side of the little pouch. We're selling more of these in a day
[3:32:31.760 --> 3:32:35.040]  than we used to sell in a month because America and the world is waking up.

[3:33:36.080 --> 3:33:41.520]  Other systems just don't compare. A lot of you have been listening for more
[3:33:41.520 --> 3:33:44.640]  than 20 years, and if you go back to those shows,
[3:33:44.640 --> 3:33:48.960]  we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones,
[3:33:48.960 --> 3:33:53.760]  how programmed master computers would manipulate control society,
[3:33:53.760 --> 3:33:58.000]  how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements and
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:00.880]  activities, but even predict what individuals would do.
[3:34:00.880 --> 3:34:03.920]  And then once you can predict what individuals were going to be doing,
[3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:08.720]  you can add stimuli through the AI systems, through the computers,
[3:34:08.720 --> 3:34:12.960]  through digital billboards, through face scanning, through the social credit score
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:15.840]  to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[3:34:15.840 --> 3:34:19.040]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say
[3:34:19.040 --> 3:34:22.560]  we were making it up. It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the
[3:34:22.560 --> 3:34:26.160]  actual corporate level blueprint documents. Well, the next level of the
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:29.040]  blueprint documents explained to us that they are
[3:34:29.040 --> 3:34:33.360]  setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out,
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:36.800]  and it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned,
[3:34:36.800 --> 3:34:41.040]  so we might want to dismantle the system now.
[3:34:43.280 --> 3:34:49.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:03.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show this afternoon for our last segment here.
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:06.880]  We're your host, guest and moderator, and teacher this afternoon,

[3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:49.440]  on radio shows and podcasts all over the world. All right, Kanye West, okay,
[3:35:49.440 --> 3:35:53.280]  in our last segment, Harriet Tubman in the
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:35:57.920]  paradigm of Prince Hall, or what we call the Prince Hall
[3:35:57.920 --> 3:36:04.640]  paradigm. Now, going back into history to understand why
[3:36:04.640 --> 3:36:08.720]  our brother Kanye West is going through what he's going through.
[3:36:08.720 --> 3:36:16.320]  In the year 111980, through Jacques de Malloy, who was the last grandmaster
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:20.240]  of a sicker society called the Knights Templar,
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:26.800]  so the term Templar means temple or the mind, okay, and so the Knights Templar
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:30.720]  became the first global military industrial complex
[3:36:30.720 --> 3:36:35.200]  representing the financial interests of the global
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:40.800]  Vatican system, okay. Now, it's very interesting if all you guys get an
[3:36:40.800 --> 3:36:45.360]  opportunity, go to Google Images and type in Balfournet
[3:36:45.360 --> 3:36:52.560]  dash, then the term of the phrase the Knights Templar. So when we say Templar,
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:57.520]  it means the temple of one's thinking or consciousness.
[3:36:57.520 --> 3:37:00.800]  So going back to, there you go, excellent picture there,
[3:37:00.800 --> 3:37:04.880]  so the Knights Templar are uplifting
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:09.200]  Balfournet, and the code word for Balfournet
[3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:15.760]  is Mohammed, from whence we get the term Mohammed. Notice at the top
[3:37:15.760 --> 3:37:19.440]  of the skull, if you guys can go back to that photo,
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:26.000]  notice the top of the skull of Balfournet is a lamp, okay. Now
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:29.920]  we have a statue, keep that picture there, as we're talking about Kanye West,
[3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:35.360]  Harriet Tubman, in the Prince Hall paradigm here on the Alex Jones show,
[3:37:35.360 --> 3:37:38.240]  with your host, moderator, and guest host,
[3:37:38.240 --> 3:37:44.160]  Bishop Larry Gators. Now notice the lamp on the top of the head of
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:50.240]  Balfournet, who is a part goat, part man, part woman, part
[3:37:50.240 --> 3:37:54.320]  beast, excellent there, and so there is a paradigm
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:38:00.240]  in black America, especially in the black sports of the
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:05.200]  vernacular, which they say that person is the goat,
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:10.160]  capital G period, capital O period, capital A
[3:38:10.160 --> 3:38:15.040]  period, capital T period, and so all of my black brothers and
[3:38:15.040 --> 3:38:18.080]  sisters, and all Americans, regardless of race,
[3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:21.840]  creed, color, or ethnicity, stop saying the term
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:25.840]  goat, because you're automatically putting that curse on yourself,
[3:38:25.840 --> 3:38:28.800]  but as you guys go back to that Balfournet picture,
[3:38:28.800 --> 3:38:34.080]  notice on the forearms, yes, of Balfournet, and if you can go to the next
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:38.880]  picture that you guys had, where it shows the term
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:45.600]  solved E.T. coagulate, there you go, and so that term solved
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:52.240]  coagula, or coagulation, is tattooed on the forearm
[3:38:52.240 --> 3:38:57.760]  of the British writer J.K. Rowland of the Harry Potter series,
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:02.960]  I kid you're not, so that term solved E.T. coagulate simply
[3:39:02.960 --> 3:39:09.600]  means students, that the deep state would dissolve a certain population,
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:17.280]  or populace, that will give way to have room for the global
[3:39:17.280 --> 3:39:20.000]  elite. So if you guys can one more time go back to that
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:25.760]  Balfournet picture, where the men are lifting him up on a chair,
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:29.440]  the one before this, yes, so the Knights Templar
[3:39:29.440 --> 3:39:32.960]  are lifting him up on a chair, but notice again,
[3:39:32.960 --> 3:39:38.000]  the lamp, okay, on the top of his head, this is where we get the term
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:47.760]  illuminato, illuminati, okay, which is Lucifer, so the term Lucifer
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:52.160]  spelt backwards from right to left, stay right there at that picture,
[3:39:52.160 --> 3:39:56.480]  so the term Lucifer spelt from right to left,
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:39:59.840]  because Hebrew is written from right to left,
[3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:03.840]  you get a Latin bogey expression, refifical,
[3:40:03.840 --> 3:40:07.120]  which means the recycling of fecal matter, okay,
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:10.240]  that's interesting, including in Ezeka 2013,
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:14.160]  the first three stones upon the breast of Lucifer were Sardis,
[3:40:14.160 --> 3:40:20.800]  S, Topaz, T, Diamond, D, STD, sexually transmitted diseases, but that lamp on
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:26.000]  the top of the head of Balfournet also represents
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:30.720]  the lamp of the Statue of Liberty, I got your attention now,
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:38.400]  well who is the woman who is portrayed as the symbol of liberty
[3:40:38.400 --> 3:40:43.040]  here in New York Harbor, a former communist,
[3:40:43.040 --> 3:40:51.440]  Marxist, and socialist, a woman by the name, okay, of Emma Lazarus,
[3:40:51.440 --> 3:40:56.720]  Emma Lazarus was a 33rd degree Scottish right mason, there you go,
[3:40:56.720 --> 3:41:02.640]  Emma Lazarus was a communist and a socialist, okay,
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:08.960]  who wrote the great Colossus, okay, she had a teenager protege by the name
[3:41:08.960 --> 3:41:15.440]  of Emma Goldman, okay, so both Emma Lazarus and later Emma
[3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:21.600]  Goldman received their financial backing from Tammy Lee Hall right here in New York
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:23.600]  City, as we're talking about in our
[3:41:23.600 --> 3:41:29.440]  conclusion, Kanye West, okay, Eric Tubman, in the
[3:41:29.440 --> 3:41:33.040]  Princehall paradigm, so then Balfournet is
[3:41:33.040 --> 3:41:38.400]  lifted on that chair, now remember a few years ago,
[3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:42.640]  Bishop Eddie Long, God rest his soul, in his church
[3:41:42.640 --> 3:41:47.040]  was lifted by black men, okay, there you go,
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:54.640]  on a chair, that is a Princehall Masonic initiation,
[3:41:54.640 --> 3:41:58.640]  signifying that Eddie Long, even though he's
[3:41:58.640 --> 3:42:03.920]  carrying the Torah, but Eddie Long has just been initiated
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:09.280]  into the dark order of what we call Princehall
[3:42:09.280 --> 3:42:13.120]  Freemasonry, oh this is powerful stuff here,
[3:42:13.120 --> 3:42:16.480]  as we're talking about not just Kanye West,
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:24.480]  in Harriet Tubman, but the paradigm called Princehall Masonry,
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:30.880]  all of these black preachers, not all, but a great percentage of Princehall
[3:42:30.880 --> 3:42:35.920]  Masons, the attorney Benjamin Krupp, I'm sure that you've heard
[3:42:35.920 --> 3:42:40.240]  of Benjamin Krupp, Benjamin Krupp is the attorney
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:46.400]  representing the family of George Floyd and Trayvon Martin, Benjamin Krupp
[3:42:46.400 --> 3:42:51.280]  is not only a part of the Bulae Sikersesade,
[3:42:51.280 --> 3:42:58.240]  of Sigma Phi Phi, but according to the Benjamin Krupp Institute website,
[3:42:58.240 --> 3:43:02.160]  okay, under about Benjamin Krupp, okay,
[3:43:02.160 --> 3:43:09.200]  paragraph three, sections four and five, it says that Benjamin Krupp is not only
[3:43:09.200 --> 3:43:13.920]  Sigma Phi Phi Bulae, he's also a Princehall Mason,
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:19.760]  he's also a member of the Michael R. Morillage
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:24.800]  in Tallahassee, Florida, notice the term Tallahassee,
[3:43:24.800 --> 3:43:31.920]  or the term olive, is inserted in Tallahassee, so we're getting back to
[3:43:31.920 --> 3:43:36.880]  Kanye, okay, Kanye West, we have to pray for him
[3:43:36.880 --> 3:43:40.640]  because the deep state wants to take him out,
[3:43:40.640 --> 3:43:44.000]  also not just Kanye West and Gay Chappelle,
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:48.720]  there was a book that was eventually banned by Barnes and Noble
[3:43:48.720 --> 3:43:55.040]  called The Adrenal Chrome Witch, I got an electronic copy, The
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:44:02.160]  Adrenal Chrome Witch by the R&B rapper Sean Puffy Combs
[3:44:02.160 --> 3:44:06.640]  or Pee Day, so I'm coming on ten four hat
[3:44:06.640 --> 3:44:09.680]  podcasts, the 29th of this month next week,
[3:44:09.680 --> 3:44:16.480]  to talk about the coming global destruction of darkness,
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:21.360]  keep that picture right there, the coming destruction of global darkness,
[3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:27.440]  where Sean P. Diddy Combs is exposing the Hollywood
[3:44:27.440 --> 3:44:32.320]  Adrenal Chrome Witch Secret Society, all notice
[3:44:32.320 --> 3:44:35.840]  wave fare putting children into furnitures,
[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:39.680]  that's not nothing new, that goes back to three to four thousand years
[3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:43.920]  within the Babylonian Empire where mothers and fathers
[3:44:43.920 --> 3:44:48.960]  were sacrificed a child once a year and put that child
[3:44:48.960 --> 3:44:55.120]  inside of a piece of a furniture that was shaped like the house god or demon
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:44:59.120]  and that child inside of that furniture, going back three to four
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:01.360]  thousand years within the Babylonian Empire,
[3:45:01.360 --> 3:45:08.640]  was to be sacrificed unto asterisk, ailing a molek, that's wave fare,
[3:45:08.640 --> 3:45:14.160]  nothing is by accident, as we're talking about in our ending today,
[3:45:14.160 --> 3:45:19.920]  Kanye West, Pirate Tommen, and the Prince Hall paradigm,
[3:45:19.920 --> 3:45:22.880]  with your host, teacher, and host and moderator,
[3:45:22.880 --> 3:45:26.880]  Bishop Larry Gates, thank you so much for being with us this afternoon,
[3:45:26.880 --> 3:45:39.920]  government.
