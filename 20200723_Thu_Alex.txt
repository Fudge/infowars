[00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:18.082]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:25.384]  This is InfoWars Live.
[00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:30.065]  I am Owen Schroer, sitting in studio for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:39.107]  We're going to be hearing from Alex coming up in the next segment and after that with some breaking news.
[00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:42.288]  You know, I was thinking to myself last night, I even wrote this note here.
[00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:54.133]  And it's not like one of those things where, oh, never bow to the mob or never apologize, but you know what?
[00:00:54.133 --> 00:01:13.257]  I really do want to apologize today because I'm guilty of just, I don't even know what it is, but I just, I get on air and I get all wound up and it's obnoxious and I rant and I yell and I say inappropriate things and I really do wish I could do better than that.
[00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:13.577]  It's just,
[00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:23.337]  This broadcast in InfoWars is like an atom bomb, a nuclear bomb of information every day.
[00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:28.419]  And so you're going to get a little radioactive when you're at the center of it.
[00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:34.081]  And when you stare into the abyss for so long, you become the abyss.
[00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:39.662]  And then there's this underlying frustration that just builds up and mounts up every day.
[00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:41.003]  It just gets worse and worse when
[00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:48.879]  It's not even to say that we have the solutions or we have all the answers or like, hey, we told you so.
[00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:51.459]  It's just like.
[00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:59.142]  How much longer do we have to sit here and put up with this, knowing what's going on, pretending it's not there, having it covered up?
[00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:02.723]  I mean, does does everything like is it total death?
[00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:03.703]  Is that what it will take?
[00:02:03.703 --> 00:02:05.824]  Because it'll be too late then.
[00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:15.011]  And so there's frustration, there's passion, and I don't mean to yell at you, it's rude, it's obnoxious.
[00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:19.354]  And so, I'm thinking to myself last night, I'm gonna make sure that I don't do that.
[00:02:19.354 --> 00:02:31.643]  In fact, why don't you just stay away from the news, and just try to keep that filth away from you, and just open up phone lines on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:02:31.643 --> 00:02:32.984]  And then I can't even help it, it's like,
[00:02:33.908 --> 00:02:34.568]  A vortex.
[00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:35.569]  I just fall right into it.
[00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.510]  I've got all these stacks of news.
[00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.893]  Black Lives Matter leaders that are pedophiles with child porn.
[00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:45.415]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:52.058]  Just the total madness, the total destruction, the total chaos in Portland and all these other Democrat-run cities.
[00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:55.080]  How they blame Trump for everything that's their fault.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.302]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[00:02:58.302 --> 00:03:00.083]  Now they're blaming Trump?
[00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:01.724]  I mean, literally, we saw it all coming.
[00:03:02.492 --> 00:03:04.654]  Trump is friends with Maxwell.
[00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:06.115]  Trump knew Maxwell and Epstein.
[00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:08.517]  Well, Trump was running Maxwell and Epstein.
[00:03:08.517 --> 00:03:14.061]  That'll be what they say next.
[00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:18.165]  But it's really, it's really a sick, twisted, it's not even an ideology.
[00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:23.529]  It's a sick, twisted state of being, state of mind.
[00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:25.551]  It's, it's psychopathic.
[00:03:25.551 --> 00:03:27.352]  It's sociopathic.
[00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:28.373]  It's suicidal.
[00:03:28.373 --> 00:03:30.355]  It's a death cult.
[00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:31.776]  It's modern day liberalism.
[00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:47.257]  When you have Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland, going out last night, and it's the protesters that throw objects at him and chant, you know, F Wheeler, get out Wheeler, kind of like what they did to the mayor of Minneapolis, Frey.
[00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:50.538]  And then what does the news say?
[00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:53.840]  Oh, Trump's feds attack again.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.787]  Trump's feds attack Wheeler, even though it's all on video of him being harassed by the citizens, by the protesters, by the rioters.
[00:04:02.787 --> 00:04:04.489]  It doesn't even matter.
[00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.830]  The news just covers it up.
[00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.952]  The news just lies about it.
[00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:13.036]  You see, I'm already getting worked up and I'm not even five minutes into the broadcast and I don't want to go there today.
[00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:15.518]  I want to stay calm today.
[00:04:15.518 --> 00:04:16.899]  I don't want to raise my voice today.
[00:04:18.348 --> 00:04:29.712]  So what I think I may just have to do before my guest Andrew Torba comes on is just take your phone calls and maybe just let you rant and rave.
[00:04:29.712 --> 00:04:35.394]  Maybe just give you the baton to rant and rave because I just don't want to do that today.
[00:04:35.394 --> 00:04:36.374]  Now when we come back
[00:04:37.549 --> 00:04:40.292]  Alex Jones has some breaking news.
[00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:42.895]  So Alex is going to give you the latest updates.
[00:04:42.895 --> 00:04:47.141]  And then when I take over in about 30 minutes, I may just go right to your phone calls.
[00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.925]  I may just skip the news for my own mental health today and go right to your calls.
[00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:52.227]  But we shall see.
[00:04:52.227 --> 00:04:54.409]  It's all coming up on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:55.751]  Alex Jones up in 60 seconds.
[00:04:59.002 --> 00:05:00.443]  It's Christmas in July.
[00:05:00.443 --> 00:05:01.663]  We ran the sale last year.
[00:05:01.663 --> 00:05:03.444]  It was very, very popular.
[00:05:03.444 --> 00:05:09.707]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[00:05:09.707 --> 00:05:15.250]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.992]  It's the American Eagle boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[00:05:20.852 --> 00:05:24.656]  And the shirts are on sale right now at infowarestore.com.
[00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:30.783]  I got the idea from the Trump campaign of having a similar shirt in the media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[00:05:30.783 --> 00:05:35.428]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and globalist, well, we're gonna make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:36.483]  I think so.
[00:06:10.678 --> 00:06:19.325]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:25.869]  But this administration, this president has demonstrated that they have a capacity to go lower than we can even possibly imagine.
[00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:28.852]  So yeah, I think we have to be concerned about that.
[00:06:28.852 --> 00:06:35.356]  His attempt to talk about mail-in voting and all the fraud that is associated with it is factually incorrect.
[00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:36.938]  He's just trying to set up a
[00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:42.540]  A situation where he has the ability to delegitimize a vote that he might lose.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:50.163]  If he loses, and I expect that he will, then we have to be prepared for what he is going to do in the immediate aftermath of such a loss.
[00:06:50.163 --> 00:06:56.066]  And what he'll do for the time period between the election and the inauguration of the next president.
[00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:59.287]  We have to be prepared for things that this nation has never faced before.
[00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:05.493]  And unfortunately, that could involve the use of these forces.
[00:07:05.493 --> 00:07:12.660]  Who knows what he'll do and the people who are as part of his administration will support him in doing.
[00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:32.477]  When President Trump was elected in November of 2016, immediately, Obama Pentagon officials, people sworn to destroy the United States and set up China as the new dominant world power, publicly canvassed the Pentagon, going door to door.
[00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:33.610]  I think?
[00:07:54.522 --> 00:07:56.363]  Nothing short of a coup.
[00:07:56.363 --> 00:08:04.846]  So they opted instead to go with the fake legal coups of Russiagate, Ukrainegate, and all the rest of it.
[00:08:04.846 --> 00:08:14.370]  But now that that has failed, they are publicly, first in the Council on Foreign Relations and other establishment organs like the Atlantic,
[00:08:15.948 --> 00:08:29.461]  And now with Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and CNN and MSNBC all stating that Trump is already a dictator and illegitimate.
[00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:34.185]  And they are inverting reality and saying he stole the 2016 election.
[00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:37.408]  He's going to try to do it again and that they are going to contest
[00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:38.947]  the election
[00:08:59.636 --> 00:09:18.904]  The former Attorney General under Obama, Eric Holder, came out and said that Trump is planning on using paramilitary troops across the United States to basically take over local governments and set up his own martial law.
[00:09:18.904 --> 00:09:23.326]  Now, of course, we've laid all this out with exact specifics and told you it was coming.
[00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:37.902]  Two years ago, I did a special report on this and I said they will trigger race war nationwide in all the major cities, surround the White House, and demand that the President step down.
[00:09:37.902 --> 00:09:45.064]  I even predicted they would do it specifically during the midterms or during the next 2020 election because they'll use that
[00:09:46.684 --> 00:09:52.126]  As cover to say that the President is contesting the election when it's them that are contesting it.
[00:09:52.126 --> 00:09:55.947]  That's how I would battle plan it, that's how I would run it, studying their operations.
[00:09:55.947 --> 00:10:00.189]  Well, that is exactly the play that they are running.
[00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:12.353]  So understand, this has gone from the drawing board as one of their main attack profiles that if I was them I would run, to now operational with them lining up
[00:10:13.857 --> 00:10:17.160]  The propaganda, the talking points for all this to unfold.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:25.787]  So again, while we're all worried about the lockdown of the virus, while we're all worried about the race riding, all of that, that's the backdrop.
[00:10:25.787 --> 00:10:30.551]  So the American people are used to being locked down when they remove Trump.
[00:10:30.551 --> 00:10:36.036]  So people are used to the new normal of things not being normal and being under martial law.
[00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:52.465]  All of this is about normalizing blue cities, blue states, multinational corporations, taking governmental control of the United States and of Western Europe, Canada, New Zealand, Australia.
[00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:59.347]  This is a corporate takeover with China militarily, with intelligence agencies and money backing it up.
[00:10:59.347 --> 00:11:01.287]  This special globalism is a corporate takeover.
[00:11:02.466 --> 00:11:02.726]  And so
[00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.749]  Are you?
[00:11:38.726 --> 00:11:49.852]  Democrats, globalists, Hollywood, while they shake their finger at you about a cop that might have killed somebody wrongfully so we're all bad, literally are backing up modern death camps.
[00:11:49.852 --> 00:11:53.414]  So, we're 100 days out from the election right now.
[00:11:53.414 --> 00:11:54.375]  About to be less than 100 days out.
[00:11:57.344 --> 00:12:00.686]  Trump is starting to understand how much danger he and the country are in.
[00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:01.667]  He's not naive anymore.
[00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:06.730]  He's already made it through three coups or what's called the rolling coup.
[00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:13.775]  But I have begged all the other publications like the Daily Caller and Breitbart and
[00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:20.517]  The Gateway Pundit, everybody, to really make this the central issue.
[00:12:20.517 --> 00:12:31.509]  Because it's not just Alex Jones telling you this three and a half years ago now, because I was reading it in Globalist Battle Plans, White Papers, it's now out in the open and they're going to do this.
[00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:48.807]  So Trump's doing the right thing sidelining Fauci and Bricks and all the rest of them, but during these briefings he needs to go directly at the fact that the NIH is still in control of policy and for every coronavirus positive they're counting 15 more people bare minimum.
[00:12:48.807 --> 00:12:50.749]  That's why you see stories all over the country of people that
[00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:57.104]  Don't even go into a clinic getting an email saying you've got coronavirus because somebody they knew tested positive.
[00:12:57.104 --> 00:13:03.047]  Or someone who goes into a clinic, they say no need to test you, then they go home and they're told you have coronavirus.
[00:13:03.047 --> 00:13:04.648]  Again, that's just one part of this fraud.
[00:13:04.648 --> 00:13:20.135]  And then CNN has the nerve to have all these stories about Trump's fumbling, Trump's doesn't believe in science, Trump's making stuff up, when they're the ones that have made up this entire fraud and sent people that were sick to nursing homes to actually get a high kill number.
[00:13:21.485 --> 00:13:31.367]  Trump must go on the total offensive instead of being nice to Governor Newsom and nice to Governor Cuomo and nice to all these other pieces of trash.
[00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:45.769]  He has to expose the monstrous criminal globalist conspiracy they've been involved in with the Wuhan lab, which again Bill Gates and Fauci and the rest of them openly ran.
[00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:48.650]  This was a setup from the beginning when the impeachment was failing.
[00:13:49.943 --> 00:14:01.571]  They release the virus, which does spread, which has amazing gain of function, knowing it would kill a bunch of old people, and then they could hype up the fear, and any time they want, shut the economy down.
[00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:06.674]  So again, we're already under a form of martial law right now.
[00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:11.898]  The question is, are you going to let them put us into full martial law?
[00:14:11.898 --> 00:14:16.782]  Because now you notice they're talking about, once Trump's gone, we're going to wipe out his base and take their guns.
[00:14:16.782 --> 00:14:18.083]  You're like, well, that'll start a war.
[00:14:18.083 --> 00:14:20.145]  They want a war to start.
[00:14:20.145 --> 00:14:25.269]  The chi-coms and the globalists want a civil war to take the United States out of the equation.
[00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:30.994]  So for those of you that think, oh, the government doesn't want to destabilize things and wreck things, even if it's a corrupt government, they want the money and power.
[00:14:30.994 --> 00:14:32.695]  No, no, no, no, no, my friends.
[00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.680]  That's what the New World Order wants.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.022]  That's their plan.
[00:14:37.022 --> 00:14:42.510]  And that's why only telling the truth about how much trouble we're in will defeat these rats.
[00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.455]  Only telling part of the story, we're gonna lose.
[00:14:45.455 --> 00:14:48.199]  Whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:48.940]  I don't
[00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:10.164]  Regular continuation of government briefing.
[00:15:10.164 --> 00:15:14.306]  This might interest you because it's I say to them, this is never going to happen.
[00:15:14.306 --> 00:15:16.088]  God willing, it never will.
[00:15:16.088 --> 00:15:17.589]  But there is a process.
[00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:18.970]  It has nothing to do with it.
[00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:27.815]  The certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency.
[00:15:27.815 --> 00:15:30.557]  It's not geography or location.
[00:15:30.557 --> 00:15:35.721]  You have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:43.886]  And you have so many rank-and-file military personnel saying, whoa, we're not a military state.
[00:15:43.886 --> 00:15:45.527]  This is not who we are.
[00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:52.011]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.
[00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:56.835]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:15:56.835 --> 00:16:02.058]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarestore.com.
[00:16:02.058 --> 00:16:03.699]  You can wear them out to political events.
[00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:04.820]  You can trigger lib darts.
[00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:12.521]  One of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[00:16:12.521 --> 00:16:18.763]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[00:16:18.763 --> 00:16:24.345]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing of their openly.
[00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:25.331]  I don't know.
[00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:40.328]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[00:16:40.328 --> 00:16:44.150]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.232]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[00:16:46.232 --> 00:16:47.713]  They don't protect from it.
[00:16:47.713 --> 00:16:50.675]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freak's faces.
[00:16:50.675 --> 00:16:53.336]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[00:16:53.336 --> 00:16:54.317]  They're at cost.
[00:16:54.317 --> 00:16:55.738]  Infowarrestore.com.
[00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:12.381]  Another part of the Great Awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches have been burned in Europe and the U.S., hundreds of Christian icons have been burned, destroyed.
[00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:15.503]  Jesus' have had their heads cut off all over the country, all over the
[00:17:15.563 --> 00:17:15.964]  I think?
[00:17:32.765 --> 00:17:35.546]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:36.647]  I'm praying for America.
[00:17:36.647 --> 00:17:37.508]  I'm praying for you.
[00:17:37.508 --> 00:17:40.649]  And I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it.
[00:17:40.649 --> 00:17:43.651]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening.
[00:17:43.651 --> 00:17:46.052]  Pray for Donald Trump to be protected.
[00:17:46.052 --> 00:17:53.596]  Pray for him to win in a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalists to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[00:17:53.596 --> 00:17:54.296]  God bless you all.
[00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:55.477]  Please pray for him for us as well.
[00:17:59.828 --> 00:18:02.438]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:32.836]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones!
[00:18:36.178 --> 00:18:40.602]  The coup against America is already underway.
[00:18:40.602 --> 00:18:52.912]  Major corporations backed by the Communist Chinese with blue cities and blue states have already usurped power from Congress and from the President and are already in control of most of the United States.
[00:18:52.912 --> 00:18:58.817]  800 plus sanctuary cities are only a small part of this larger operation.
[00:18:59.477 --> 00:19:13.621]  We're illegal aliens, many of them felons, who've committed serious crimes, are above the law, and police are instructed not to even let ICE know where they are, if they happen to pull them over and find out that they're a rapist or even a murderer.
[00:19:13.621 --> 00:19:22.244]  That's just one example of the lawlessness of the globalists and how Nancy Pelosi admits MS-13 is basically part of their paramilitary arm.
[00:19:23.144 --> 00:19:28.830]  This is the reality of communist China through their offices in the U.S.
[00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.151]  shipping and fentanyl.
[00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:35.596]  This is part of the global alliance against the United States.
[00:19:35.596 --> 00:19:46.126]  And now they're going to use the election as the trigger to create nationwide unrest, pretend Trump is a dictator, and try to drive him from office through intimidation and lies.
[00:19:46.867 --> 00:19:58.195]  If that happens, Congress and the federal agencies will be completely stampeded under globalist communist control and a giant purge of the American people will explode onto the scene.
[00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:01.297]  That is the next phase of their operation.
[00:20:01.297 --> 00:20:02.678]  It always is.
[00:20:02.678 --> 00:20:09.022]  They're following a tried and true playbook because it's almost always worked, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:09.022 --> 00:20:16.247]  I cannot express to you enough the level of magnitude and danger that our constitutional republic is in.
[00:20:17.348 --> 00:20:18.729]  That the world is in.
[00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:31.220]  Paramilitary leftist forces have been turned loose to burn down buildings, attack police stations, burn police stations, occupy police stations.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:38.446]  In some cities like Minneapolis, 400 plus businesses burned, dozens killed, and the media calls them peaceful.
[00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:41.108]  They are setting the stage for total anarchy and death.
[00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:45.730]  And when citizens stand up and defend their property, like the McCluskeys in St.
[00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:55.673]  Louis, they are SWAT team rated and then they are indicted in the face of common law and the Second Amendment and the right to defend your property.
[00:20:55.673 --> 00:21:02.135]  This is all about the green light for the globalists and their communist ground forces to make their move.
[00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:08.117]  Trump must meet this head on and expose their entire paradigm before it's too late.
[00:21:08.917 --> 00:21:21.306]  They are now on record admitting Pelosi, Holder, Schumer, the list goes on and on that they plan to forcibly remove President Trump and anyone that doesn't go along with it will quote be put in prison.
[00:21:21.306 --> 00:21:22.987]  These are terrorists.
[00:21:22.987 --> 00:21:31.733]  These are people holding us hostage with the lockdown, preparing us for a bigger lockdown, normalizing that this alliance of criminal states
[00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:33.774]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:21:33.774 --> 00:21:36.997]  Back inside the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:21:36.997 --> 00:21:37.577]  Owen Troyer with you.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.100]  Here's what we're going to do.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.462]  I'm going to give out the phone number in the next segment.
[00:22:05.462 --> 00:22:09.925]  I'm going to cover some news now and then.
[00:22:09.925 --> 00:22:19.853]  And, you know, I can understand if you're President Donald Trump and you got into office and you really weren't expecting this onslaught against you.
[00:22:19.853 --> 00:22:26.618]  You really didn't understand the forces of evil that were going to be lined up against you, against America, to be in this position.
[00:22:26.618 --> 00:22:28.119]  But it's gotten so out of hand now.
[00:22:29.718 --> 00:22:45.945]  You either just have to be honest and say that this whole thing is getting blown right now by the White House, or you are a QAnon type who really believes that there's secret things going on behind the scenes and so all is going to be well.
[00:22:45.945 --> 00:22:47.845]  Now, I don't necessarily believe that.
[00:22:47.845 --> 00:22:55.809]  I hope that with all my heart, I think like anybody else would, but... For example, Operation Legend.
[00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:56.529]  It's a total failure.
[00:22:57.585 --> 00:22:59.066]  It's a total failure on its face.
[00:22:59.066 --> 00:23:00.466]  Why?
[00:23:00.466 --> 00:23:02.067]  Because what is the real goal?
[00:23:02.067 --> 00:23:06.870]  What, you're going to go into these cities and stop the violence?
[00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.591]  Not going to stop the violence.
[00:23:08.591 --> 00:23:12.793]  It's going to lead to more violence.
[00:23:12.793 --> 00:23:14.414]  And again, I get it.
[00:23:14.414 --> 00:23:17.015]  Like, you've got to go in and do something.
[00:23:17.015 --> 00:23:22.538]  But why do you think the mayor of Portland was out on the streets?
[00:23:24.309 --> 00:23:27.652]  Do you think he was out there to be a part of the solidarity of the movement?
[00:23:27.652 --> 00:23:28.933]  No, folks.
[00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:31.155]  It was a setup.
[00:23:31.155 --> 00:23:39.862]  They knew if he went out there with his armed security that he'd be attacked and he'd be, you know, objects thrown at him and assaulted and cursed at.
[00:23:39.862 --> 00:23:45.186]  They didn't care because they knew they could use that footage to blame the feds.
[00:23:45.186 --> 00:23:46.247]  So, see?
[00:23:46.247 --> 00:23:48.989]  You lost!
[00:23:48.989 --> 00:23:52.172]  You are now playing checkers and they're playing chess.
[00:23:54.466 --> 00:24:09.878]  Operation Legend should have been, okay, we're going into Chicago and Portland and these cities, and in the fog of the war, you go rip these Democrat mayors out of their offices and bring them in for questioning.
[00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:18.164]  You go rip any politician who has been in support of these riots
[00:24:19.343 --> 00:24:25.364]  Who has taken any foreign money, any Soros money, you go bring them in for questioning.
[00:24:25.364 --> 00:24:30.085]  That is Operation Legend.
[00:24:30.085 --> 00:24:34.666]  What's happening right now is Operation Setup.
[00:24:34.666 --> 00:24:35.586]  Look, I get it.
[00:24:35.586 --> 00:24:36.926]  You gotta send the Feds in.
[00:24:36.926 --> 00:24:39.507]  The Democrats are letting their cities burn to the ground.
[00:24:39.507 --> 00:24:44.328]  In fact, better yet, the Democrats are burning their own cities to the ground to blame Trump.
[00:24:45.984 --> 00:25:08.119]  So, until you deal with the cause and the root of this problem, which are Chinese-funded, Soros-funded Democrats in mayor's offices, governor's offices, prosecuting attorneys, district attorneys, you're never going to win.
[00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:10.120]  You're always going to get beat.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.401]  You're always going to get set up.
[00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:20.209]  I gotta take a deep breath here, because I'm starting to get mad again.
[00:25:20.209 --> 00:25:29.357]  It's just, how can you not see the total setup that the Democrats and the media engage in all day long?
[00:25:29.357 --> 00:25:37.024]  All these people do is alley-oop themselves up fake stories, whether it's Bubba Wallace or Jussie Smollett or now Ted Wheeler.
[00:25:37.024 --> 00:25:40.888]  Oh my gosh, Ted Wheeler got attacked by his own supporters.
[00:25:40.888 --> 00:25:42.009]  But what does the media tell you?
[00:25:43.616 --> 00:25:44.957]  Oh, it was the Feds.
[00:25:44.957 --> 00:25:46.398]  The Feds.
[00:25:46.398 --> 00:25:47.919]  The Feds attacked Wheeler.
[00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:48.599]  No, they didn't.
[00:25:48.599 --> 00:25:50.500]  That's a lie.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.382]  It was all the BLM riders.
[00:25:53.382 --> 00:25:57.724]  Who, by the way, are 90% white.
[00:25:57.724 --> 00:25:58.985]  But see, it's all a joke.
[00:25:58.985 --> 00:26:02.087]  And, you know, I really don't understand why Americans don't get this yet.
[00:26:02.087 --> 00:26:04.228]  Like the headline from the Federalist.
[00:26:04.228 --> 00:26:08.211]  Renaming the Redskins won't save a single black life.
[00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:08.571]  Really?
[00:26:10.233 --> 00:26:12.994]  Folks, none of this is about saving a black life.
[00:26:12.994 --> 00:26:17.175]  Black Lives Matter isn't even about black people.
[00:26:17.175 --> 00:26:22.436]  This is all about a takedown of America, a communist revolution.
[00:26:22.436 --> 00:26:26.157]  That's what this is.
[00:26:26.157 --> 00:26:33.659]  And if you try to deal with it as anything less than insurrection and treason, you will lose.
[00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:45.108]  I'm gonna do a news blitz on the other side and give out the phone number because if I just, if I stare into this abyss for too long, I'm just gonna start yelling again and I promised I wouldn't do that, so...
[00:26:46.374 --> 00:26:48.775]  We're going to give out the number when we come back, do a News Blitz.
[00:26:48.775 --> 00:26:50.335]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:26:50.335 --> 00:26:54.436]  Remember, Christmas in July sale at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:26:54.436 --> 00:26:55.857]  Free shipping storewide.
[00:26:55.857 --> 00:26:57.397]  The people are awakening.
[00:26:57.397 --> 00:27:00.118]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:02.179]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[00:27:02.179 --> 00:27:04.539]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[00:27:04.539 --> 00:27:13.922]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[00:27:14.162 --> 00:27:22.748]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[00:27:22.748 --> 00:27:29.473]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[00:27:29.473 --> 00:27:30.914]  In their own words, they admit it.
[00:27:30.914 --> 00:27:35.337]  Show, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[00:27:35.797 --> 00:27:37.739]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:38.839]  They're Faraday cages.
[00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:40.541]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[00:27:40.541 --> 00:27:42.522]  They work absolutely great.
[00:27:42.522 --> 00:27:51.669]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.

[00:28:55.495 --> 00:28:59.258]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[00:28:59.258 --> 00:29:03.441]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:07.925]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[00:29:07.925 --> 00:29:13.990]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:25.039]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:30.221]  Take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[00:29:30.221 --> 00:29:34.282]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[00:29:34.282 --> 00:29:37.403]  It's been pre-planned, organized, globally.
[00:29:37.403 --> 00:29:39.663]  And it's extremely predatory.
[00:29:39.663 --> 00:29:51.446]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[00:29:51.446 --> 00:29:54.527]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[00:29:58.607 --> 00:30:01.350]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:18.985]  Alright, I'm going to cover some news here, give out the phone number at the end of this segment because I don't want to do a totally open phone line situation.
[00:30:18.985 --> 00:30:21.568]  I want to at least lay out some stories here.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:28.901]  That will get your brain churning before you dial on into the Alex Jones Show today, Owen Schroer filling in.
[00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:34.582]  Uh, let me just not hesitate and let me dive right in here.
[00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:38.143]  The COVID hoax continues, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:38.143 --> 00:30:49.525]  And, you know, I've decided there's gonna be some headlines if you're a daily listener and stuff, or even just old stories, older headlines, and I'm just gonna go back over today because... See, we have this weird thing where...
[00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:58.393]  In a way, we're almost like the drive-by media where, yeah, we'll cover a story and then there's no resolution and we just forget about it.
[00:30:58.393 --> 00:31:01.474]  And so because of that, that's like taking the loss.
[00:31:01.474 --> 00:31:05.276]  So, I know you've read this story and heard this story before.
[00:31:05.276 --> 00:31:09.117]  I know that it's been on InfoWars once, twice, three times.
[00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:11.838]  But, I mean, it's still there.
[00:31:11.838 --> 00:31:13.279]  It's still, like,
[00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:17.253]  We should be carving it into mountains.
[00:31:17.253 --> 00:31:18.835]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:23.841]  People who never took COVID tests being told they're COVID positive.
[00:31:23.841 --> 00:31:24.762]  So, I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[00:31:24.762 --> 00:31:32.871]  It's like, I can cover this one day and move on or I can sit here and say it every day until people actually get it.
[00:31:32.871 --> 00:31:34.894]  They're faking a pandemic.
[00:31:40.009 --> 00:31:46.514]  I'm going to have to take a lot of deep breaths to not scream today, and I really am going to focus on not doing that.
[00:31:46.514 --> 00:31:51.018]  But yeah, I tend to get a little worked up.
[00:31:51.018 --> 00:32:03.628]  I tend to get a little mad when they're faking a pandemic and destroying my future, destroying my country, lying about it the entire time.
[00:32:07.145 --> 00:32:10.766]  Taking my liberties, taking my freedoms, faking a pandemic?
[00:32:10.766 --> 00:32:16.967]  Yeah, I'm pissed off.
[00:32:16.967 --> 00:32:20.308]  And so I guess it's just like a sign to just show you how pissed I am.
[00:32:20.308 --> 00:32:23.649]  I start screaming and banging on the desk.
[00:32:23.649 --> 00:32:27.810]  I'm pissed, man.
[00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:32.131]  This shouldn't even be political.
[00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:33.272]  That's what's so frustrating.
[00:32:33.272 --> 00:32:34.612]  It shouldn't even be political.
[00:32:37.523 --> 00:32:44.406]  Connecticut State Lab finds 90 false positives out of 144 COVID tests.
[00:32:44.406 --> 00:32:49.628]  So they're faking the numbers, they're making up the numbers, they're rigging the numbers, they're inflating the numbers.
[00:32:49.628 --> 00:32:53.309]  They're faking a pandemic!
[00:32:53.309 --> 00:32:55.330]  Why is this even political?
[00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.571]  But I'll tell you why.
[00:32:58.571 --> 00:33:00.212]  Here's why.
[00:33:00.212 --> 00:33:06.054]  We know why Fauci and Gates and China and all these other people are faking the pandemic.
[00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:10.295]  They've got a secret plan for a new world order.
[00:33:10.295 --> 00:33:13.838]  Basically, I mean, really what it comes down to is they just want to have all their slave labor in China.
[00:33:15.063 --> 00:33:31.531]  And so all the worldwide corporations agreed, okay, well, you've got billions of people, you've got a slave labor force, so we'll put all the manufacturing and industry in China, but first we have to destroy America, because they're still going to want to have that prosperity.
[00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:40.135]  So we've got to destroy America first, and then once we do that, we can just do all the slave labor in China, and then we'll make all the goods and stuff, and then we'll kind of roll out everything after that.
[00:33:41.308 --> 00:33:45.151]  And Gates is involved, and Fauci is involved, Obama was involved, they're all involved.
[00:33:45.151 --> 00:33:51.096]  All the big corporations that are faking this pandemic, they're all involved.
[00:33:51.096 --> 00:33:53.518]  But so why is it political?
[00:33:53.518 --> 00:33:58.402]  Why does the average dumbass liberal in the street buy into it?
[00:33:58.402 --> 00:34:00.103]  Folks, because they've been...
[00:34:01.482 --> 00:34:05.885]  This isn't a matter of just rhetoric here.
[00:34:05.885 --> 00:34:08.526]  These people have literally been brainwashed.
[00:34:08.526 --> 00:34:11.328]  They're literally under mind control.
[00:34:11.328 --> 00:34:23.296]  They're literally under a scientific light pattern and radio wave frequency mind control.
[00:34:23.296 --> 00:34:25.457]  Literally.
[00:34:25.457 --> 00:34:27.838]  How do you deal with that?
[00:34:27.838 --> 00:34:30.120]  I would suggest all of these people
[00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:32.570]  We're good to go.
[00:34:48.032 --> 00:34:50.255]  To explain what it is they're doing out there.
[00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:52.457]  I mean, let's try to get into their minds.
[00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:57.103]  This is a giant scientific experiment.
[00:34:57.103 --> 00:35:03.670]  They are the pawns of a scientific mind control device.
[00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.913]  They need to be evaluated.
[00:35:05.913 --> 00:35:08.156]  They need to be evaluated.
[00:35:11.007 --> 00:35:12.868]  I'm saying this because I care.
[00:35:12.868 --> 00:35:15.288]  If I didn't care about these people, you know what?
[00:35:15.288 --> 00:35:16.689]  I would be an authoritarian.
[00:35:16.689 --> 00:35:18.269]  I would want Trump to be a tyrant.
[00:35:18.269 --> 00:35:19.930]  I would want him to send in the feds.
[00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.030]  Not with rubber bullets.
[00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.150]  Not with paint balls.
[00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.331]  Not with pepper balls.
[00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:24.831]  You understand?
[00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:27.472]  I care about these people.
[00:35:27.472 --> 00:35:28.292]  We need each other.
[00:35:29.966 --> 00:35:31.167]  I hate this, man.
[00:35:31.167 --> 00:35:41.291]  When I tune out of news for the night and I like to listen to music or, you know, watch a movie or something, and I can escape from the politics, I'm thinking, man, America is so great!
[00:35:41.291 --> 00:35:46.954]  Look at all these great creative artists and musicians and, like, it's just, it's awesome!
[00:35:46.954 --> 00:35:48.675]  Why do we fight all the time?
[00:35:48.675 --> 00:35:51.756]  How can we heal America?
[00:35:51.756 --> 00:35:55.778]  How can we heal America?
[00:35:55.778 --> 00:35:57.739]  They're faking a pandemic.
[00:35:57.739 --> 00:35:58.960]  It shouldn't even be political.
[00:36:00.162 --> 00:36:02.543]  Black Lives Matter is not about black lives.
[00:36:02.543 --> 00:36:11.926]  More black people have died in America because of Black Lives Matter than have been saved.
[00:36:11.926 --> 00:36:13.427]  None of this should even be political.
[00:36:13.427 --> 00:36:14.607]  Why is it political?
[00:36:14.607 --> 00:36:19.129]  Because these people are under mind control.
[00:36:19.129 --> 00:36:24.071]  Scientific mind control.
[00:36:24.071 --> 00:36:28.513]  They tested light patterns and frequencies on the TV.
[00:36:28.513 --> 00:36:29.413]  It's mind control.
[00:36:30.626 --> 00:36:32.587]  They know.
[00:36:32.587 --> 00:36:39.429]  These radio waves from your cell phone weaken your inhibitions and your abilities to think.
[00:36:39.429 --> 00:36:41.170]  Slows your brain function.
[00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.110]  We are under attack.
[00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.931]  Humans, folks.
[00:36:44.931 --> 00:36:54.615]  Humanity is under a scientific attack.
[00:36:54.615 --> 00:36:55.275]  Let me just go on.
[00:36:56.277 --> 00:37:01.741]  Fox News, the N95 masks aren't stopping coronavirus, health experts say.
[00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:03.302]  Again, the masks don't even work.
[00:37:03.302 --> 00:37:05.704]  You had Cuomo in Georgia.
[00:37:05.704 --> 00:37:08.266]  Cuomo in Georgia, not wearing a mask.
[00:37:08.266 --> 00:37:13.090]  He's all praise for the mass murder he committed in the nursing homes and he tells you you have to wear a mask.
[00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.752]  He's down there in Georgia, doesn't even put on a mask.
[00:37:15.752 --> 00:37:24.939]  DC Mayor exempts city and federal workers from mask policy on same day she launches investigation into President Trump for not wearing a mask in his own hotel.
[00:37:27.459 --> 00:37:32.360]  Oh, again folks, why do we put up with these people?
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.021]  Why does Trump put up with these people?
[00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:46.765]  You know, Lincoln, very controversial president if you actually look into his history, but, you know, you talk to the average person, you study the average history textbook, they don't really get into the weeds of the controversy of Lincoln.
[00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:50.126]  Lincoln was arresting journalists and writers and all kinds of crap.
[00:37:50.126 --> 00:37:55.067]  It's like they don't even know about Robert E. Lee.
[00:37:58.024 --> 00:38:00.666]  And it's just, you know, it's just a joke.
[00:38:00.666 --> 00:38:03.428]  Why do we put up with these people?
[00:38:03.428 --> 00:38:04.468]  And it always falls back.
[00:38:04.468 --> 00:38:05.349]  Mind control.
[00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:07.170]  Brainwashing.
[00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.813]  Multiple vaccine doses could be necessary to protect from coronavirus, says Bill Gates.
[00:38:11.813 --> 00:38:14.995]  The guy selling you it.
[00:38:14.995 --> 00:38:18.538]  It's like you go to buy a new car.
[00:38:18.538 --> 00:38:20.819]  And, you know, you can get a nice new car.
[00:38:20.819 --> 00:38:21.500]  You're in a little coupe.
[00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.691]  You're like, okay, I like that one.
[00:38:23.691 --> 00:38:26.593]  And then the dealer's like, well, that's a nice coupe there.
[00:38:26.593 --> 00:38:29.875]  I'll be happy to sell it to you, but you're probably going to need two of them.
[00:38:29.875 --> 00:38:31.996]  And you're just like, what?
[00:38:31.996 --> 00:38:35.518]  I don't... I just need the one.
[00:38:35.518 --> 00:38:37.339]  He's like, well, I think you're going to need two cars.
[00:38:37.339 --> 00:38:39.440]  It's like, oh, you're just trying to make money.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.581]  You're just trying to sell a new car.
[00:38:40.581 --> 00:38:44.984]  That's literally what Bill Gates is doing, except with poison.
[00:38:44.984 --> 00:38:45.624]  Except with poison.
[00:38:49.266 --> 00:38:55.011]  Man who led Black Lives Matter protests arrested on child pornography charges.
[00:38:55.011 --> 00:38:58.053]  Ted Wheeler lies about being attacked by feds.
[00:38:58.053 --> 00:39:00.875]  Renaming the Redskins won't save a single black life.
[00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:02.417]  None of it's about black lives, folks.
[00:39:02.417 --> 00:39:04.999]  More black people are dead because of Black Lives Matter than alive.
[00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:13.238]  Zero National News Network's cover photo of BLM supporter kneeling on white baby's neck.
[00:39:13.238 --> 00:39:16.001]  That individual, Isaiah Jackson, has now been arrested.
[00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:22.248]  A special education teacher commented on that Facebook post and said, Lean into it!
[00:39:22.248 --> 00:39:25.011]  Kill that baby!
[00:39:25.011 --> 00:39:26.472]  Stop effing around!
[00:39:26.472 --> 00:39:27.513]  Literally, folks.
[00:39:27.513 --> 00:39:28.735]  Lean into it until death.
[00:39:29.875 --> 00:39:33.876]  Black Lives Matter is now a mass-murdering death cult.
[00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:35.856]  And what is going on with the Navy, folks?
[00:39:35.856 --> 00:39:47.259]  Again, I have friends in the Navy, there's good people in the Navy, but Navy is investigating uniformed sailor Sarah Dudry for busting into pro-Trump rally, harassing protesters, and screaming, F-Trump.
[00:39:47.259 --> 00:39:53.921]  Plus all the Navy ships crashing into each other, standing down in the South China Sea, one's on fire, something's up in the Navy.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:06.566]  Vicki Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated, and then died.
[00:40:06.566 --> 00:40:11.909]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be intubation.
[00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:13.250]  We know what's gonna happen.
[00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.651]  It's a blue city.
[00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:15.872]  Same story yet again.
[00:40:15.872 --> 00:40:17.853]  And they say her heart gave out.
[00:40:18.813 --> 00:40:23.695]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube with COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record.
[00:40:23.695 --> 00:40:26.397]  I want everyone you know before they go into the hospital and get killed.
[00:40:26.397 --> 00:40:29.978]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[00:40:29.978 --> 00:40:36.942]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[00:40:36.942 --> 00:40:41.064]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you.
[00:40:41.744 --> 00:40:46.392]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[00:40:46.392 --> 00:40:50.459]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[00:40:50.459 --> 00:40:53.223]  Don't end up like Vicki Gibbs or everyone.
[00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:56.972]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:41:25.111 --> 00:41:25.731]  We're good.
[00:41:55.771 --> 00:41:58.539]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup.
[00:41:58.539 --> 00:41:59.682]  My second cup of the day.
[00:41:59.682 --> 00:42:00.564]  It's really strong.
[00:42:00.564 --> 00:42:04.494]  I shouldn't do this because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:06.821]  Yes, folks.
[00:42:26.237 --> 00:42:26.557]  We're good to go.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.603]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[00:42:58.603 --> 00:42:59.063]  You're on the air.
[00:42:59.063 --> 00:43:00.526]  Thanks for holding.
[00:43:00.526 --> 00:43:01.327]  I sure can, sir.
[00:43:01.327 --> 00:43:02.328]  Thank you.
[00:43:02.328 --> 00:43:05.493]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[00:43:12.643 --> 00:43:14.084]  I just want to plug in.
[00:43:14.084 --> 00:43:18.508]  I'm a truck driver and two before that have changed the way I drive.
[00:43:18.508 --> 00:43:21.771]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[00:43:21.771 --> 00:43:25.153]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[00:43:25.153 --> 00:43:33.200]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:39.565]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[00:43:39.565 --> 00:43:41.847]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[00:43:41.847 --> 00:43:44.309]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:46.992]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[00:43:46.992 --> 00:43:51.015]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[00:43:51.015 --> 00:43:52.817]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[00:43:52.817 --> 00:43:53.557]  So that means a lot to me.
[00:43:53.557 --> 00:43:54.898]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:58.621]  We love you.
[00:43:58.621 --> 00:44:01.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:14.036 --> 00:44:21.881]  President Trump, this is an emergency warning to you.
[00:44:21.881 --> 00:44:26.663]  They're going to do everything, and you already know this, to steal the election.
[00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:31.786]  But here's what you may not know, and what your campaign staff is certainly not telling you.
[00:44:31.786 --> 00:44:35.308]  You're losing your base right now.
[00:44:35.308 --> 00:44:39.351]  And there's a lot of examples of this, and this is just giving it to you like it is.
[00:44:39.351 --> 00:44:41.012]  And you know what?
[00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:43.233]  Here's how I know that this is happening.
[00:44:44.622 --> 00:44:51.967]  And this just happened to me this week, and it just happened to me again today.
[00:44:51.967 --> 00:45:04.235]  I'm a creature of habit when it comes to my routine, and there's certain men that when they talk, I listen.
[00:45:04.235 --> 00:45:08.798]  And for about four or five years, President Trump has been one of those men.
[00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:19.936]  And I noticed just this week with the Trump interview that was on Fox News, for the first time ever, I was completely uninterested in what President Trump was saying.
[00:45:21.803 --> 00:45:22.743]  And I didn't even realize it.
[00:45:22.743 --> 00:45:25.325]  It's just, oh, they were airing the Fox interview on Fox.
[00:45:25.325 --> 00:45:28.766]  I have a whole multimedia setup in my home to monitor everything.
[00:45:28.766 --> 00:45:32.488]  And usually I'd click over the audio and I'd go listen to Trump.
[00:45:32.488 --> 00:45:34.829]  Instead, I was listening to Dan Bongino or Michael Savage.
[00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:35.930]  I forget who it was.
[00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.011]  And usually I'd pause that and I'd go listen to what Trump was saying.
[00:45:39.011 --> 00:45:40.972]  And for the first time ever, I just had no interest.
[00:45:40.972 --> 00:45:41.532]  And then it hit me.
[00:45:41.532 --> 00:45:44.434]  I was like, whoa.
[00:45:44.434 --> 00:45:47.175]  What does that symbolize?
[00:45:47.175 --> 00:45:50.096]  What does that symbolize?
[00:45:50.096 --> 00:45:50.837]  I've got a whole
[00:45:51.954 --> 00:45:53.195]  We're good to go.
[00:46:13.131 --> 00:46:27.577]  You're losing a lot of your base, specifically women voters who now feel that they can't even leave their homes and feel safe, or be in their homes and feel safe, or send their kids out and feel safe.
[00:46:27.577 --> 00:46:32.059]  And I could reflect that in phone calls today if I wanted to.
[00:46:32.059 --> 00:46:34.620]  So, with that, let me give out the phone number.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:40.142]  Anything we discussed is fair game, but you know, what does that represent to you?
[00:46:40.142 --> 00:46:41.083]  Do you feel the same?
[00:46:41.983 --> 00:46:46.765]  Are you at the same kind of point with Trump where it's just like, you know what it is?
[00:46:46.765 --> 00:46:50.686]  It's that his words almost have no value to me anymore.
[00:46:50.686 --> 00:46:56.868]  And I'm just going to stop right there because I don't want to make a whole thing about it, but what does that represent to you?
[00:46:56.868 --> 00:46:58.048]  Are you in that same boat?
[00:46:58.048 --> 00:47:00.489]  Do you hang on Trump's every word like you used to?
[00:47:00.489 --> 00:47:06.691]  Do you listen to Trump's words and speeches to give you hope and think that there's going to be results still?
[00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:09.612]  Or have you moved on?
[00:47:09.612 --> 00:47:10.772]  So that'll be a main topic.
[00:47:12.014 --> 00:47:15.295]  Or any of the other news we discussed, the number 877-789-2539.
[00:47:15.295 --> 00:47:15.675]  877-789-2539.
[00:47:15.675 --> 00:47:24.796]  And for me, it's like, do I need to come on here and be more encouraging of Trump?
[00:47:24.796 --> 00:47:26.757]  Or do I need to come on here and be more critical of Trump?
[00:47:26.757 --> 00:47:31.797]  Or do I need to come on here and just act like Trump isn't there at all?
[00:47:31.797 --> 00:47:32.498]  Well, how about this?
[00:47:32.498 --> 00:47:37.338]  I mean, you know, InfoWars, next year's news today.
[00:47:37.338 --> 00:47:40.659]  And look, well, I'm not even going to go there, but
[00:47:42.076 --> 00:47:48.279]  Folks, who would have predicted this series of news?
[00:47:48.279 --> 00:47:50.360]  Who could have seen this coming?
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:55.722]  A series of headlines from CNN in the last 24 hours.
[00:47:55.722 --> 00:47:56.642]  I wish her well.
[00:47:56.642 --> 00:48:00.064]  Trump's shocking support for Ghislaine Maxwell.
[00:48:01.496 --> 00:48:11.139]  Well, I don't know if you could call that support, but of course they're going to spin it, because as I told you, they're going to spin this thing so deep, they're going to claim Trump was running Epstein.
[00:48:11.139 --> 00:48:11.619]  Ha!
[00:48:11.619 --> 00:48:12.919]  You think that's nuts?
[00:48:12.919 --> 00:48:13.979]  They fake hate crimes.
[00:48:13.979 --> 00:48:15.160]  They fake pandemics.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.040]  These people know no shame.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.721]  They have no low.
[00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:21.181]  They reside in hell.
[00:48:21.181 --> 00:48:23.102]  Their consciousness is in hell.
[00:48:23.102 --> 00:48:24.622]  They can't go any lower than that.
[00:48:24.622 --> 00:48:26.503]  They'll fake anything.
[00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:27.503]  Another headline, CNN.
[00:48:28.871 --> 00:48:34.218]  Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell knew each other well, says former Epstein partner.
[00:48:34.218 --> 00:48:35.680]  Don't you love this?
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:44.873]  So CNN actively reaches out to a guy who's knowingly partners with Epstein, a sex trafficker, a minority sex trafficker.
[00:48:46.547 --> 00:48:52.391]  I mean, as worse as it gets, MeTooCNN, and they love this guy!
[00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:55.673]  And they reach out to him, and they get info from him, and they do an interview with him.
[00:48:55.673 --> 00:48:57.193]  Oh, he's the best ever!
[00:48:57.193 --> 00:48:59.135]  He's the one that will expose Trump!
[00:48:59.135 --> 00:49:01.036]  He's the one that was with Epstein!
[00:49:01.036 --> 00:49:03.917]  He's the one that was partnered with Epstein!
[00:49:03.917 --> 00:49:05.719]  It's total bonkers!
[00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:15.388]  Another CNN headline, Trump claims not to be following Maxwell case despite long ties to Epstein.
[00:49:15.388 --> 00:49:28.614]  So it's like, they literally covered up the Epstein thing, they literally covered up all the pedophilia, they literally covered up the sex trafficking, they literally bring on all the Epstein associates, and then what do they do?
[00:49:28.614 --> 00:49:31.615]  They blame Trump.
[00:49:31.615 --> 00:49:35.056]  These are sick people.
[00:49:35.056 --> 00:49:35.997]  Sick people.
[00:49:37.253 --> 00:49:38.254]  People at CNN.
[00:49:38.254 --> 00:49:40.975]  Don Lemon is sick!
[00:49:40.975 --> 00:49:43.617]  And you know, I realized something too.
[00:49:43.617 --> 00:49:50.621]  You know, Don Lemon did a segment in 2013 about why black men in America struggle.
[00:49:50.621 --> 00:49:51.741]  And he was actually real.
[00:49:51.741 --> 00:50:01.427]  And he said it's because there's no fathers, they get into a life of crime, they drop out of high school, they have a bad culture of gangbanging and drug running and pimping.
[00:50:02.679 --> 00:50:06.000]  And he called it all out in a whole CNN segment in 2013.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.221]  Funny how that just disappears.
[00:50:08.221 --> 00:50:13.803]  But see, folks, even CNN hosts are brainwashed.
[00:50:13.803 --> 00:50:16.244]  Even CNN hosts are under mind control.
[00:50:16.244 --> 00:50:20.046]  Breanna Kylar on air yesterday with a doctor
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.240]  I'm not a doctor.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.961]  It's like one of their guests, and he's talking about hydroxychloroquine.
[00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:30.903]  He says, well, and she's like bashing, and he's like, well, hydroxychloroquine has actually been used successfully in some studies.
[00:50:30.903 --> 00:50:33.383]  And she's like, how could you can't say that on my airways?
[00:50:33.383 --> 00:50:34.143]  Never say that again!
[00:50:34.143 --> 00:50:38.525]  And he's like, he's like, Brianna, this is coming from doctors.
[00:50:38.525 --> 00:50:39.625]  This has been known for decades.
[00:50:39.625 --> 00:50:44.086]  And she's like, I will not have you say a deadly drug is safe and effective!
[00:50:44.086 --> 00:50:46.927]  You're just espousing what the president is saying!
[00:50:46.927 --> 00:50:47.247]  And he's like,
[00:50:47.907 --> 00:50:48.727]  Well, what are you?
[00:50:48.727 --> 00:50:50.988]  And she's like, I talk to doctors and scientists!
[00:50:50.988 --> 00:51:01.991]  And he goes, well, apparently not the doctors and scientists at CNN, because folks, he was reading off a CNN story!
[00:51:01.991 --> 00:51:05.052]  They're so drunk on their own hatred.
[00:51:05.052 --> 00:51:08.473]  They're so blinded by their own hatred.
[00:51:08.473 --> 00:51:12.574]  They don't even live in reality anymore.
[00:51:12.574 --> 00:51:13.714]  How do you deal with these people?
[00:51:16.229 --> 00:51:19.892]  How do you deal with these people?
[00:51:19.892 --> 00:51:24.455]  Let me finish up this news and I promise in the next segment we're going to go all to these phone calls.
[00:51:24.455 --> 00:51:26.377]  The crew is getting them lined up.
[00:51:26.377 --> 00:51:31.301]  Adam Silver, that's the NBA commissioner, gives max donation to Joe Biden.
[00:51:31.301 --> 00:51:44.051]  Of course, the MLB opened up its season with Black Lives Matter protests and knees during the anthem and Black Lives Matter signs on their stadiums.
[00:51:44.051 --> 00:51:45.412]  Folks, I'm telling you something right now.
[00:51:47.529 --> 00:51:56.246]  And you know what, maybe this will be part of the thing too, because I'm sure we have baseball fans and basketball fans and hockey fans and everybody listening right now.
[00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:56.907]  I've been a St.
[00:51:56.907 --> 00:51:57.829]  Louis Cardinal fan.
[00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:00.190]  For my whole life.
[00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:03.051]  I used to go to... I'm not even exaggerating you.
[00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:05.272]  I would go to 40, 50 games a summer.
[00:52:05.272 --> 00:52:06.712]  It was the most fun thing.
[00:52:06.712 --> 00:52:13.394]  All I would do during the summer is I would go play baseball during the day for the local SLABA team that I was on.
[00:52:13.394 --> 00:52:15.795]  We played about 50 to 60 games a year.
[00:52:15.795 --> 00:52:19.095]  And then at night, I would go watch the Cardinals play baseball.
[00:52:19.095 --> 00:52:20.956]  For like three straight summers.
[00:52:20.956 --> 00:52:23.517]  It was like all I did.
[00:52:23.517 --> 00:52:27.918]  And... Heck, I'd love to have a kid someday with that same experience, but let me tell you.
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:34.001]  If anybody on that franchise takes a knee, I'm done!
[00:52:34.001 --> 00:52:42.903]  And I guarantee you, same thing for Giants fans, same thing for Red Sox fans, same thing for all the Yankees are going to have a BLM message when they open their season.
[00:52:42.903 --> 00:52:43.724]  I mean, what a joke.
[00:52:43.724 --> 00:52:45.604]  There's no one in the stands anyway.
[00:52:45.604 --> 00:52:47.544]  They have cardboard cutouts in the stands.
[00:52:47.544 --> 00:52:49.305]  That's going to be the only fans left!
[00:52:49.305 --> 00:52:53.146]  They pipe in, sound like a fake crowd on TV.
[00:52:53.146 --> 00:52:54.006]  I mean, pathetic!
[00:52:55.655 --> 00:52:58.777]  NBA court revealed with Black Lives Matter logo.
[00:52:58.777 --> 00:53:00.458]  So the left has now killed sports.
[00:53:00.458 --> 00:53:06.803]  But you know, ironically enough, COVID actually killed sports, and now the left is coming in with their propaganda just to put it in the grave.
[00:53:06.803 --> 00:53:10.325]  Alright, I got some other news, but I gotta do this.
[00:53:10.325 --> 00:53:12.567]  When I come back in the next segment, I'm gonna go right to your calls.
[00:53:12.567 --> 00:53:20.052]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know about Infowarsstore.com.
[00:53:20.052 --> 00:53:21.633]  We have a Christmas in July special.
[00:53:21.633 --> 00:53:23.875]  Before I tell you about that, I just have to say this.
[00:53:25.117 --> 00:53:31.822]  What we've been able to do with your support at Infowarsstore.com is beyond miraculous.
[00:53:31.822 --> 00:53:33.844]  Seriously.
[00:53:33.844 --> 00:53:47.274]  In fact, it's so miraculous, we've got other projects that we're working on that we're trying to basically shoot the moon on or jump out of a skyscraper without a parachute and plan on landing on our feet.
[00:53:47.274 --> 00:53:47.755]  But you know what?
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:54:03.370]  I just put full faith in God and this creation and I have full faith in this audience that you'll continue to support us throughout this because we have major plans to expand in the face of the tyranny and the censorship.
[00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:04.031]  That's all you can do.

[00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:54.994]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[00:54:54.994 --> 00:54:59.696]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[00:55:00.376 --> 00:55:08.739]  This Planetary Corporate Reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[00:55:08.739 --> 00:55:28.626]  And the good news is there are still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsite, summit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[00:55:29.286 --> 00:55:30.306]  Destinies.
[00:55:30.306 --> 00:55:37.229]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[00:55:37.229 --> 00:55:41.730]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:43.831]  So take action, or be slaves!
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:56.568]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[00:55:56.568 --> 00:56:05.795]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[00:56:06.155 --> 00:56:20.322]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[00:56:20.322 --> 00:56:34.529]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[00:56:34.989 --> 00:56:36.670]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:43.354]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[00:56:43.354 --> 00:56:48.136]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[00:56:48.136 --> 00:56:50.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:55.717 --> 00:56:59.819]  Band dot video presents Real Stable Genius.
[00:56:59.819 --> 00:57:02.419]  Real Stable Genius.
[00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:06.781]  Today we salute you, Mr. Mask in the Car Wearer.
[00:57:06.781 --> 00:57:09.102]  Mr. Mask in the Car Wearer.
[00:57:09.102 --> 00:57:16.905]  You go from your bed to your bathroom to your kitchen to your car and that mask never comes off your face.
[00:57:18.145 --> 00:57:23.006]  It doesn't matter that you live alone, sleep alone, and are alone in your car.
[00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:28.348]  You won't spread that deadly virus to yourself.
[00:57:28.348 --> 00:57:38.331]  If you're told to wear a blindfold or never leave your house, you wouldn't question because you'll always bow to authority.
[00:57:39.771 --> 00:57:51.239]  So crack open an ice-cold Cook Light, Mr. Mask-in-the-Car-Wearer, and let it sit there and get warm, since you can't drink it through your mask.
[00:57:51.239 --> 00:57:53.681]  I'm told I'm not thirsty anyway!
[00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:55.683]  Cook Light, Austin, Texas.
[00:57:56.303 --> 00:57:59.587]  Big shout out to Darren McBreen for putting that together.
[00:57:59.587 --> 00:58:04.972]  The crew, Sam, just beautifully played the role of Mr. Mask in the car wear.
[00:58:04.972 --> 00:58:07.015]  I don't know who wrote that or was singing that song.
[00:58:07.015 --> 00:58:09.017]  I guess he was okay too.
[00:58:09.017 --> 00:58:12.260]  But folks, that video, see, we don't have the power to go viral anymore.
[00:58:13.061 --> 00:58:19.186]  But you have the power to make us go viral when you download the clips from Band.Video and share them.
[00:58:19.186 --> 00:58:22.689]  Of course, probably half this audience is banned on social media, too.
[00:58:22.689 --> 00:58:24.671]  The story is at NewsWars.com.
[00:58:24.671 --> 00:58:27.553]  Real stable genius, Mr. Mask in the car wearer.
[00:58:28.539 --> 00:58:34.202]  And of course, you can download the links on Bandot Video to these videos.
[00:58:34.202 --> 00:58:39.424]  Guys, what channel on Bandot Video is that on so that I can give them the accurate information?
[00:58:39.424 --> 00:58:39.884]  Just let me know.
[00:58:39.884 --> 00:58:42.285]  We don't have to do it right now, but folks, I'll let you know.
[00:58:42.285 --> 00:58:43.726]  You can download that and share it.
[00:58:43.726 --> 00:58:44.486]  People are watching it.
[00:58:44.486 --> 00:58:44.967]  They love it.
[00:58:44.967 --> 00:58:47.768]  This is the kind of stuff that can help defeat the New World Order.
[00:58:47.768 --> 00:58:49.469]  A little comedy for you.
[00:58:49.469 --> 00:58:51.530]  A little dose of reality, if you will.
[00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:52.790]  Speaking of a dose of reality,
[00:58:54.855 --> 00:58:56.536]  Liberal Democrat.
[00:58:56.536 --> 00:58:57.316]  There it is right there.
[00:58:57.316 --> 00:58:58.677]  The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[00:58:58.677 --> 00:58:59.998]  Real stable genius.
[00:58:59.998 --> 00:59:02.640]  Mr. Mask in the Car Wearer at Bandit.video.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.881]  You can download that and share it.
[00:59:04.881 --> 00:59:06.862]  A little dose of reality there.
[00:59:06.862 --> 00:59:07.062]  Now!
[00:59:07.062 --> 00:59:12.585]  A little dose of reality for a Liberal Democrat that goes on Fox News.
[00:59:12.585 --> 00:59:15.367]  Marie Harf is her name.
[00:59:15.367 --> 00:59:21.090]  And she was on The Five today and she got a question that she really couldn't respond to.
[00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:22.311]  And it went something like this.
[00:59:23.683 --> 00:59:27.006]  May I ask a quick follow-up and then Charlie jump in.
[00:59:27.006 --> 00:59:37.014]  So Marie, is there another Republican-led city that is having the kinds of problems that we're seeing in the Democratic-led city?
[00:59:37.014 --> 00:59:40.558]  And since I know, well let me let you answer that.
[00:59:40.558 --> 00:59:40.838]  Is there?
[00:59:42.984 --> 00:59:49.068]  Well, look, Democrats have been in charge of the big cities in our country for a long time, and there have been... It's a yes or no question.
[00:59:49.068 --> 00:59:50.409]  Well, it's more complicated.
[00:59:50.409 --> 00:59:51.849]  It's not binary, Harris.
[00:59:51.849 --> 00:59:54.031]  The issue is that Democrats are in charge of most cities.
[00:59:54.031 --> 00:59:54.291]  No, no, no.
[00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:54.931]  It's not a choice.
[00:59:54.931 --> 00:59:56.372]  Violence rates have gone up and down.
[00:59:56.372 --> 01:00:03.997]  Is there a Republican-led city that is having the same type of violence and unrest on its streets the way that a Democratic-led...
[01:00:05.126 --> 01:00:06.108]  Trail of cities is right now.
[01:00:06.108 --> 01:00:09.793]  There are many parts of this country that are led by Republicans.
[01:00:09.793 --> 01:00:12.958]  There are many parts of this country led by Republicans that have very high levels of violence.
[01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:16.624]  Do they look like the streets of Portland and Chicago right now?
[01:00:16.624 --> 01:00:18.466]  The streets of Portland look like this.
[01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:22.157]  I'm fine.
[01:00:22.157 --> 01:00:24.298]  The streets of Portland didn't look like this.
[01:00:24.298 --> 01:00:40.243]  The streets of Portland didn't look like this until President Trump sent in federal troops who were anonymous, they don't have their names on, that's what anonymous means, and had them arresting people with no due process in rented buildings.
[01:00:40.243 --> 01:00:41.263]  Here it is again, folks.
[01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:43.644]  It's the same thing.
[01:00:43.644 --> 01:00:49.586]  As soon as the Democrats or a liberal progressive are forced to deal with their own reality, they just deflect.
[01:00:51.121 --> 01:00:53.361]  That's all they do, is they deflect.
[01:00:53.361 --> 01:00:55.302]  She knows that it's... She even admits it!
[01:00:55.302 --> 01:00:58.182]  She's like, well, the Democrats have been in charge of these cities for decades!
[01:00:58.182 --> 01:00:58.642]  Yeah!
[01:00:58.642 --> 01:01:00.303]  That's why all the jobs are leaving!
[01:01:00.303 --> 01:01:03.843]  That's why violence and crime are up!
[01:01:03.843 --> 01:01:07.364]  Because the Democrats have been running the cities!
[01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:08.584]  Homelessness up!
[01:01:08.584 --> 01:01:09.724]  Crime up!
[01:01:09.724 --> 01:01:10.865]  Jobs down!
[01:01:10.865 --> 01:01:12.165]  Wages down!
[01:01:12.165 --> 01:01:16.006]  And then you simply say, hey, where's an example of a Republican area that this is happening?
[01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:16.346]  Well, the...
[01:01:19.847 --> 01:01:21.028]  It's Trump!
[01:01:21.028 --> 01:01:24.470]  Trump did this!
[01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:28.133]  Seriously, look, I think Trump made the wrong move sending in the feds.
[01:01:29.864 --> 01:01:32.006]  Let the Democrats burn their own cities, man.
[01:01:32.006 --> 01:01:35.649]  Look, I don't like Washington as much as the next guy.
[01:01:35.649 --> 01:01:36.850]  The feds aren't helping.
[01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:42.514]  Unless you're going to send in the feds or the military to arrest the deep state criminals in Chicago, in St.
[01:01:42.514 --> 01:01:48.099]  Louis, who take Soros money and take Chi Com money, then don't do Operation Legend.
[01:01:48.099 --> 01:01:49.560]  That's Operation Legend.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.762]  What you're doing is Operation Get Blamed for Everything.
[01:01:53.447 --> 01:01:56.429]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[01:01:56.429 --> 01:02:04.994]  We'll all tell them to wear a mask or they're gonna die, and then we'll release the pressure for a while, then bring it back and squeeze it harder, and release it again, and we'll be the virtuous ignorers.
[01:02:04.994 --> 01:02:10.477]  We'll be the angels, even though our lord and master, Bill Gates, helped fund the whole COVID-19.
[01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:11.418]  No!
[01:02:11.418 --> 01:02:14.160]  Don't Sadookie me!
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:25.592]  That's right, that's the code word for Bill Gates' operation he carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[01:02:25.592 --> 01:02:30.959]  As you know for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:33.522]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the
[01:02:34.002 --> 01:02:36.985]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[01:02:36.985 --> 01:02:37.265]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:55.986 --> 01:03:04.728]  You know, if Jesus Christ came back today, the liberal Democrat progressives would kill him.
[01:03:21.837 --> 01:03:23.118]  In fact, I shouldn't even put that out there.
[01:03:23.118 --> 01:03:33.009]  I should just ask, if Jesus came back today, what do you think the Liberal Democrat Progressives would do?
[01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:35.351]  Alright, I'm not going to hesitate.
[01:03:35.351 --> 01:03:42.078]  We're going to start taking your calls right now and all the way through until my guest Andrew Torba joins me in an hour.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.721]  I just wanted to say, yeah, I mean it's funny that you brought up kind of, I don't know,
[01:04:07.659 --> 01:04:12.902]  I don't want to put words in your mouth, but losing hope in Trump and not kind of latching on to everything he says.
[01:04:12.902 --> 01:04:13.363]  No, no, no.
[01:04:13.363 --> 01:04:23.189]  What I asked was, I gave the example of how it used to be I would always stop whatever I was doing to listen to what President Trump said, and it wasn't even a conscious thing.
[01:04:23.189 --> 01:04:25.830]  I just realized I stopped doing it this week.
[01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:27.371]  It's like I stopped caring in a way.
[01:04:27.371 --> 01:04:30.393]  So I asked what that represents to you.
[01:04:30.393 --> 01:04:33.395]  So you're saying that represents to you losing hope in Trump?
[01:04:34.107 --> 01:04:40.192]  Well, not so much that, but like you said, it's weird that you brought that up because I feel the same way, you know?
[01:04:40.192 --> 01:04:45.556]  And it's kind of like this subconscious thing that's happened, like I just don't care anymore.
[01:04:45.556 --> 01:04:48.799]  I've been very, very vocal about my support for Trump.
[01:04:48.799 --> 01:04:50.380]  I've supported Trump since the very beginning.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.142]  I volunteered for his campaign.
[01:04:53.142 --> 01:04:57.105]  First time around, I've been with the Proud Boys since 2016 out here in the Northwest.
[01:05:00.111 --> 01:05:16.962]  Organizing events and rallies and stuff with Joey Gibson and people out here and, you know, I mean, I've been a very active, you know, person in this and it's like, so for me to now, you know, feel the way that you're feeling a little bit where it's just like, you know.
[01:05:17.845 --> 01:05:21.268]  Well, you know, I just, I don't, I have no interest.
[01:05:21.268 --> 01:05:23.069]  Well, and here's the problem.
[01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:31.857]  People like you, and I've talked to other Proud Boys as well, and some of Trump's biggest supporters, of which I am, at the beginning, they're all feeling the same way.
[01:05:31.857 --> 01:05:37.542]  Women who were really vocal in their support of Trump are even more upset than we are.
[01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:44.507]  And, you know, by the way, because I was thinking about this, you know, it's such a shame what has been done to the Proud Boys because
[01:05:45.486 --> 01:05:58.275]  You know, if I wanted to come on air today, or let's say I wanted to join the Proud Boys, I would immediately be attacked from all these lying news publications, and they would call me a terrorist, and they would say that the Proud Boys are terrorists.
[01:05:58.275 --> 01:05:59.275]  A complete lie!
[01:05:59.275 --> 01:06:01.697]  A complete lie!
[01:06:01.697 --> 01:06:11.223]  But if I came out today and I said, oh, I'm a leader of Black Lives Matter, I'm a leader of Antifa, who is literally a murderous gang, then that would be totally accepted.
[01:06:11.223 --> 01:06:14.585]  And so, it's just so sad what they've done to you guys.
[01:06:16.346 --> 01:06:19.688]  Just good for y'all for sticking by your guns and not bowing to this.
[01:06:19.688 --> 01:06:21.669]  But no, I think it's sad.
[01:06:21.669 --> 01:06:32.933]  I think it's sad that we kind of just subconsciously, unconsciously have just lost hope in Trump, if that's what you want to call it, whatever, or disinterested in what he says anymore because we're just not getting action.
[01:06:32.933 --> 01:06:34.514]  Anything else, Jake?
[01:06:34.514 --> 01:06:40.777]  Yeah, well, like you said, too, you know, with the Proud Boys thing, it's like, you know, you got a lot of us kind of standing by, you know, like, what do we do?
[01:06:40.777 --> 01:06:41.557]  What can we do?
[01:06:42.455 --> 01:06:44.256]  You know, it's such dangerous times now.
[01:06:44.256 --> 01:06:59.242]  I mean, you see people that are being, you know, arrested or killed or charges brought against them for blatantly protecting themselves and their properties as, you know, you know, the media and the leftists and BLM and Antifa, they are absolutely
[01:06:59.867 --> 01:07:13.139]  Waiting for people like us to step up and try to do anything at all so that we, you know, and if, and... Yep, and see, and exactly, and they've already got their court precedent set with Fields and what will happen with the Proud Boys in New York.
[01:07:13.139 --> 01:07:15.881]  They have their Soros lawyers and judges all lined up.
[01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:17.022]  The whole system is rigged.
[01:07:17.022 --> 01:07:17.943]  And you know what?
[01:07:17.943 --> 01:07:25.669]  Let me just say one other thing, Jake, and thank you for the great call in response to Jake.
[01:07:25.669 --> 01:07:26.170]  Think about
[01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:31.116]  This is just, it's literally just such a joke.
[01:07:31.116 --> 01:07:32.256]  I almost don't even want to go there.
[01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:36.378]  But here's why you'll have, you can come on in Rob, it's alright.
[01:07:36.378 --> 01:07:42.520]  Here's why you will have most conservatives and Trump supporters never say anything bad about President Trump.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:50.422]  Because they're so afraid to eat their own words that they'll never come out against the President.
[01:07:51.274 --> 01:08:02.717]  Whereas, if I come out and I go anti-Trump and I say Trump's the one responsible for all the destruction, America's gonna fall under Trump, and then he makes me eat crow and saves America, I'm glad!
[01:08:02.717 --> 01:08:04.678]  I'm glad!
[01:08:04.678 --> 01:08:06.218]  I'm not in this for pride!
[01:08:06.218 --> 01:08:11.540]  I would love it for Trump to make me eat my own words.
[01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:28.620]  But see, most of the Trump supporters and media are cowards because they either rely on President Trump for all of their breaking news or interviews, and they don't want to feel shamed into eating their own words if they say something and then he takes action.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:32.322]  They're just cowards!
[01:08:32.322 --> 01:08:34.483]  But, I mean, call it as it is, folks.
[01:08:34.483 --> 01:08:36.604]  President Trump said you're going to get sick of winning.
[01:08:36.604 --> 01:08:37.965]  I'm sick of losing!
[01:08:37.965 --> 01:08:40.407]  President Trump said he's going to give the country back to us.
[01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:42.068]  We've never had less control of our country!
[01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.234]  Again, I hope he makes me eat these words.
[01:08:45.234 --> 01:08:47.976]  I'll be popping bottles!
[01:08:47.976 --> 01:08:50.859]  But I'm not gonna sit here like a coward and not call it like it is.
[01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.882]  Alright, Curtis in Oregon.
[01:08:53.882 --> 01:08:57.365]  Curtis, you're on the Alex Jones Show, go ahead.
[01:08:57.365 --> 01:08:59.727]  Hi Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[01:08:59.727 --> 01:09:10.056]  The first point I wanted to make to President Trump was that he lost my vote when he resigned the Patriot Act, but if he wants to win this election and my vote back,
[01:09:10.663 --> 01:09:22.088]  We need to see some major action against the heads of these child trafficking networks and the bankers and everyone responsible for the downfall of America.
[01:09:22.088 --> 01:09:24.129]  Because we know what's happening right now.
[01:09:24.129 --> 01:09:32.453]  They are sitting there licking their lips, managing this decline, waiting to repo our houses, waiting to put us on the streets.
[01:09:32.453 --> 01:09:34.194]  And they're loving it.
[01:09:34.194 --> 01:09:36.355]  And we're going to lose everything.
[01:09:36.355 --> 01:09:38.316]  And we know they're going to attack voting stations.
[01:09:39.293 --> 01:09:40.915]  And there's not going to be an election.
[01:09:40.915 --> 01:09:44.919]  They're going to get their way with this mail-in ballot, and he is going to lose.
[01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:47.401]  Yeah, and I'm afraid that you're right.
[01:09:47.401 --> 01:09:51.965]  And if Trump's approach is, oh, well, I want to heal America, hey, look, I get that.
[01:09:51.965 --> 01:10:00.454]  You know, you can try to heal yourself from eating healthy and running and everything, but if your leg has gangrene, you've got to cut the leg off!
[01:10:01.778 --> 01:10:04.541]  And that's the only way you're going to get healthy, you know?
[01:10:04.541 --> 01:10:07.724]  I mean, folks, we've got a cancer in this country.
[01:10:07.724 --> 01:10:10.647]  There is a cancer in this country, okay?
[01:10:10.647 --> 01:10:11.988]  We refuse to accept it.
[01:10:11.988 --> 01:10:13.189]  We know what it is.
[01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:14.791]  And until it's dealt with, we're in big trouble.
[01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:16.953]  But you bring up the sex trafficking networks.
[01:10:16.953 --> 01:10:20.056]  Rob Dude just brought this in for me.
[01:10:20.056 --> 01:10:20.897]  It's developing right now.
[01:10:22.122 --> 01:10:32.771]  Epstein floodgates open as judge rules explosive docs detailing Ghislaine Maxwell's sex life in Virginia Jufri's defamation case be unsealed within a week.
[01:10:32.771 --> 01:10:35.954]  Now we'll see if this leaves anything or not.
[01:10:35.954 --> 01:10:47.563]  Remember, Maxwell or someone in Maxwell's camp or somebody claims that Maxwell's going to cooperate and she has tapes of top-level business execs and politicians and everything having sex with underage people and kids.
[01:10:49.721 --> 01:10:51.002]  We'll see if any of it comes out.
[01:10:51.002 --> 01:10:54.025]  Again, Trump seems to be twiddling his fingers on this.
[01:10:54.025 --> 01:10:57.428]  I don't understand why, but that's what's going on.
[01:10:57.428 --> 01:11:00.351]  Anything else, Curtis?
[01:11:00.351 --> 01:11:12.562]  Well, I would say, you know, if we're going to watch the decline of our country, we need to manage this decline with the same strategy that the elites usually use.
[01:11:12.562 --> 01:11:16.065]  They usually mop up all of the country's assets and
[01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:21.715]  We're getting to the point where financial scorched earth policy is going to be our only option.
[01:11:21.715 --> 01:11:27.600]  You know, it's funny you say that because not myself and other people I'm talking to have completely changed their tact.
[01:11:28.644 --> 01:11:35.947]  As far as like, you know, investments or asset management or financial management, you just have to at this point.
[01:11:35.947 --> 01:11:39.048]  And I'm not even saying I'm not even saying I know which way to go.
[01:11:39.048 --> 01:11:41.669]  It's just these are such different times.
[01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:42.210]  Everything.
[01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:44.450]  Everyone's approach has to change.
[01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:49.853]  You're going to have to start placing bets in certain places because it's not business as usual right now.
[01:11:49.853 --> 01:11:51.973]  Curtis, thank you so much for the call.
[01:11:51.973 --> 01:11:52.374]  All right.
[01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:54.895]  When we come back, I'm to go right back to your phone calls, folks.
[01:11:54.895 --> 01:11:57.736]  Christmas in July at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:11:57.736 --> 01:11:58.036]  Now, look,
[01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:01.864]  I'm down to one privacy pocket now.
[01:12:01.864 --> 01:12:03.886]  So, this one will probably be gone tomorrow.
[01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:06.589]  Some sticky fingers will come in here and take it.
[01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:07.951]  I'm down to one.
[01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:10.494]  Started this week with four on the desk.
[01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:14.438]  But, you know, I'm a pretty good salesman, so I guess the crew is like, hey, I gotta get me one of those.
[01:12:14.438 --> 01:12:15.239]  But folks, here it is.
[01:12:15.239 --> 01:12:17.441]  The Privacy Pocket at m4store.com.
[01:12:17.441 --> 01:12:19.163]  Brand new design, by the way.
[01:12:19.784 --> 01:12:31.072]  The big complaint people have about Farity enclosures for your cell phone, they're thick, they're bulky, they don't fit in a pocket, I don't want to wear it around, I just, you know, I want the privacy, I don't like being tracked and traced, but there's no convenient way to do it.
[01:12:31.072 --> 01:12:32.693]  This is it!
[01:12:32.693 --> 01:12:36.536]  Paper-thin, fits in any pocket.
[01:12:36.536 --> 01:12:39.759]  I can put it in my back jean pocket, I can put it in my jacket pocket.
[01:12:40.726 --> 01:12:42.187]  So convenient.
[01:12:42.187 --> 01:12:43.688]  So thin.
[01:12:43.688 --> 01:12:46.030]  Stops the dangerous radiation.
[01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:47.531]  Stops the tracking and tracing.
[01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:51.153]  It's the Privacy Pocket at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:12:51.153 --> 01:12:52.834]  Fits easily into your pocket.
[01:12:52.834 --> 01:12:59.459]  Much of the United States bureaucracy, all of Hollywood, and most of our media is under international banking control.
[01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:04.742]  The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers on record to carry out this operation.
[01:13:04.742 --> 01:13:09.806]  Now, under the guise of medical security, they're bringing us medical charity.
[01:13:10.606 --> 01:13:22.996]  That we see much of the federal government, the Democrats, the Republicans, all saying, except for Trump and a few people, that we need a nationwide force mask mandate to make everyone wear a mask.
[01:13:22.996 --> 01:13:27.720]  Even though just months ago we had the Surgeon General and others say, don't wear a mask, it's all a fraud.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:28.841]  Now they say you must.
[01:13:29.261 --> 01:13:30.202]  Wear a mask.
[01:13:30.202 --> 01:13:31.784]  It's a sign of slavery.
[01:13:31.784 --> 01:13:32.905]  It's a sign of submission.
[01:13:32.905 --> 01:13:34.346]  I know you as listeners understand that.
[01:13:34.346 --> 01:13:46.118]  But we need sheriffs and county commissioners and city councils and others to stand up and say, we are sanctuary cities for reality and for state and local sovereignty against the globalists.
[01:13:46.118 --> 01:13:47.760]  This isn't the federal government taking over.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.842]  It's the UN through the federal government.
[01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.723]  And we as American citizens must say no.
[01:13:53.609 --> 01:13:55.510]  In July, we ran the sale last year.
[01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:57.271]  It was very, very popular.
[01:13:57.271 --> 01:14:03.553]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[01:14:03.553 --> 01:14:08.475]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[01:14:08.475 --> 01:14:13.618]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[01:14:14.698 --> 01:14:18.500]  And the shirts are on sale right now at infowarestore.com.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:24.623]  I got the idea from the Trump campaign of having a similar shirt to media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[01:14:24.623 --> 01:14:29.265]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and globalist, well, we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[01:14:30.123 --> 01:14:31.524]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:15:04.528 --> 01:15:11.931]  Listen, Deshaun Jackson, Steven Jackson, Nick Cannon, Ice Cube.
[01:15:11.931 --> 01:15:14.252]  Man, what the hell are y'all doing?
[01:15:14.252 --> 01:15:18.013]  Like, y'all want racial equality.
[01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.614]  We all do.
[01:15:19.614 --> 01:15:25.716]  I don't understand how insulting another group helps our cause.
[01:15:25.716 --> 01:15:28.657]  And the only person who called y'all on it was Kareem.
[01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:32.399]  We can't allow black people to be prejudiced also.
[01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:42.871]  Especially if we're asking for white folks to respect us, give us economic opportunity, and things like that.
[01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:48.972]  I'm so disappointed in these men, but I don't understand how you beat hatred with more hatred.
[01:15:48.972 --> 01:15:54.493]  That stuff should never come up in your vocabulary, and it should never come up in your heart.
[01:15:54.493 --> 01:16:00.994]  I don't understand it, I'm never gonna accept it, and I'm asking you guys, I'm begging you guys, man,
[01:16:02.051 --> 01:16:03.131]  You guys are famous.
[01:16:03.131 --> 01:16:04.752]  You got a platform.
[01:16:04.752 --> 01:16:06.313]  We got to do better, man.
[01:16:06.313 --> 01:16:07.573]  I want allies.
[01:16:07.573 --> 01:16:10.434]  I don't want to alienate anybody.
[01:16:10.434 --> 01:16:18.597]  And to take shots at the Jewish race, white race, I just don't like it because it's not right.
[01:16:18.597 --> 01:16:22.399]  And I had to call him on it because it's really, it's really been on my heart.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:33.998]  So that's Charles Barkley, former NBA player, Hall of Famer, and hosts many NBA talk shows on television.
[01:16:33.998 --> 01:16:34.819]  It'll be interesting to see.
[01:16:34.819 --> 01:16:36.862]  I won't be tuned in to any of the garbage anymore.
[01:16:38.522 --> 01:16:43.027]  I'd be stunned if this doesn't permeate into the basketball talk every day.
[01:16:43.027 --> 01:16:47.531]  I mean, they put Black Lives Matter on the court, so... Here's the thing.
[01:16:47.531 --> 01:16:49.373]  COVID killed professional sports.
[01:16:49.373 --> 01:16:54.278]  The left is just putting the dead body into the casket and into the grave right now.
[01:16:54.278 --> 01:16:58.342]  It's really sad.
[01:16:58.342 --> 01:17:00.244]  We've gone from Rick Monday picking up
[01:17:01.112 --> 01:17:05.294]  A couple of Chicago Libtards burning a flag at Wrigley Field.
[01:17:05.294 --> 01:17:12.237]  From him stopping that from happening and picking it up and getting a wild round of applause to now it's the players burning the flag.
[01:17:12.237 --> 01:17:14.298]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:17:14.298 --> 01:17:16.679]  And you know what?
[01:17:16.679 --> 01:17:19.840]  I should also send this to you, Daria.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:26.083]  There was a Russian former KGB agent in 1983 who did a TV interview.
[01:17:26.083 --> 01:17:28.344]  I'm going to have to send this to you.
[01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:30.525]  It's so incredible.
[01:17:31.769 --> 01:17:38.368]  How he lays out the war on America with Chinese propaganda and liberal indoctrination.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:47.804]  I mean, literally, 1983 warns America, hey, here's what's about to happen, and it's all happening.
[01:17:47.804 --> 01:17:50.065]  I guess I collude with Russia now, too.
[01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:52.466]  See, but that's another thing, all the lies about Russia.
[01:17:52.466 --> 01:18:03.112]  Russia is anti-globalism, Russia is anti-pedophilia, Russia is anti-New World Order, Russia's not perfect, but they're not in on all the global corruption, pedophilia, sex stuff.
[01:18:03.922 --> 01:18:07.685]  And so that's why they demonized Russia, and that's why Russia is another crown jewel.
[01:18:07.685 --> 01:18:09.066]  Yeah, that's the interview right there.
[01:18:09.066 --> 01:18:11.768]  We should air that whole thing.
[01:18:11.768 --> 01:18:14.330]  We should air that whole thing in some segment today.
[01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:16.321]  I'm going to do that.
[01:18:16.321 --> 01:18:26.685]  And also, we're going to have Bishop Larry Gaters on to host the fourth hour, who's going to be getting more into the weeds with the Black Lives Matter stuff and race relations in this country.
[01:18:26.685 --> 01:18:28.705]  Bishop Larry Gaters.
[01:18:28.705 --> 01:18:30.966]  So that's all coming up on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:30.966 --> 01:18:33.567]  For now, let me get back to your phone calls.
[01:18:33.567 --> 01:18:34.788]  Baldy.
[01:18:34.788 --> 01:18:36.708]  Baldy in New York.
[01:18:36.708 --> 01:18:40.109]  Go ahead, Baldy.
[01:18:40.109 --> 01:18:43.711]  The interview that Bishop did the other week was one of the best ones you've had in a while.
[01:18:45.310 --> 01:19:08.504]  The very first day that President Trump was, uh, first briefed on the Wuhan, uh, Chinese virus, January 3rd, Baldy was the first caller into the war room predicting an imminent false flag pandemic, which will lead to forced inoculation, but you cannot have forced inoculation before you have gun confiscation.
[01:19:08.504 --> 01:19:14.448]  Then all through March, I was sounding the trumpet, calling it the April Fool's virus.
[01:19:15.495 --> 01:19:18.456]  Now who has been the biggest fool of them all?
[01:19:18.456 --> 01:19:20.657]  Sadly, President Trump.
[01:19:20.657 --> 01:19:22.758]  You have been fooled.
[01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.579]  You have been deceived.
[01:19:24.579 --> 01:19:29.701]  And you continue to masquerade because you're afraid to admit that you have been fooled.
[01:19:29.701 --> 01:19:31.322]  But wait, let me ask you this though.
[01:19:31.322 --> 01:19:32.042]  Let me ask you this.
[01:19:32.042 --> 01:19:33.323]  I remember those calls.
[01:19:33.323 --> 01:19:35.384]  I mean, we have the most informed audience out there.
[01:19:35.384 --> 01:19:36.744]  There's no doubt.
[01:19:36.744 --> 01:19:37.645]  But let me ask you this though.
[01:19:37.645 --> 01:19:40.766]  Do you really think President Trump has been fooled or is he just playing along?
[01:19:40.766 --> 01:19:42.287]  Because if you remember
[01:19:42.907 --> 01:19:45.008]  A fool would continue to bring out Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci,
[01:20:03.939 --> 01:20:11.645]  Instead of the doctors from Bakersdale, the heroes, the real rock stars, or the doctor in Texas.
[01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:16.649]  How come his first briefing back he did not bring out the doctor in Texas that has been curing it?
[01:20:16.649 --> 01:20:17.850]  Sure, there is a range.
[01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:19.031]  Yeah, no, that's a great point.
[01:20:19.031 --> 01:20:25.476]  He did sideline Fauci, but why doesn't he bring up his own team of doctors that are saying, hey, stop the mask, it doesn't work.
[01:20:25.476 --> 01:20:27.678]  Hey, the COVID is less deadly than the seasonal flu.
[01:20:27.678 --> 01:20:28.859]  Hey, they're faking the tetanus.
[01:20:28.859 --> 01:20:30.420]  Hey, I saw what they did in the nursing homes.
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:32.541]  I saw what they did in the hospitals to get more money.
[01:20:32.541 --> 01:20:35.443]  I saw them blow people's lungs out and murder them with ventilators.
[01:20:35.443 --> 01:20:36.664]  Yeah, why isn't he doing that?
[01:20:36.664 --> 01:20:37.425]  That's a great question.
[01:20:37.425 --> 01:20:38.726]  I don't know.
[01:20:38.726 --> 01:20:45.350]  There is a ray of hope, though, when he says that he prefers the cure as opposed to the vaccination.
[01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:50.794]  The problem is that President Trump constantly wants to win the favor of everybody.
[01:20:50.794 --> 01:20:55.517]  But he does not understand, or maybe he does now, there is a certain segment that will hate him.
[01:20:55.928 --> 01:21:00.771]  Not just because he's Trump, not just because of the media, but also because they're jealous of him.
[01:21:00.771 --> 01:21:02.732]  It's pure jealousy.
[01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:04.813]  But he could turn it around tomorrow.
[01:21:04.813 --> 01:21:07.254]  Like I said, get the Baker Sales doctors on.
[01:21:07.254 --> 01:21:10.036]  Get the doctor in Texas that's curing everybody.
[01:21:10.036 --> 01:21:11.156]  And I'm not taking credit.
[01:21:11.156 --> 01:21:12.637]  Baldy is not the genius.
[01:21:12.637 --> 01:21:14.558]  It is the genius, like you said, of everybody.
[01:21:14.558 --> 01:21:15.519]  The Infowars.
[01:21:15.519 --> 01:21:18.360]  I've been listening to Infowars since 2005.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.962]  I would not have half of the knowledge I have if it wasn't for Alex.
[01:21:21.962 --> 01:21:23.443]  So thank you, Alex, wherever you are.
[01:21:24.105 --> 01:21:26.147]  Always, Road Warrior Owen, you're the best.
[01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:27.228]  Goodbye.
[01:21:27.228 --> 01:21:28.449]  Thank you, Baldy.
[01:21:28.449 --> 01:21:30.471]  Let's go to Mark in Seattle.
[01:21:30.471 --> 01:21:31.892]  Mark, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:31.892 --> 01:21:34.394]  Go ahead.
[01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:41.320]  Yes, I'm watching the situation unfold here in Seattle, obviously down south there in Portland.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:44.803]  And, you know, I agree with you 100%, Owen.
[01:21:44.803 --> 01:21:50.728]  Why send the feds in to make yourself look like a fool if you're not going to actually dispatch them appropriately?
[01:21:52.048 --> 01:22:01.936]  You know, I mean, the way that I'm seeing it go down is that they're, you know, they're letting Antifa, Black Lives Matter, the writers, just play with them.
[01:22:01.936 --> 01:22:05.379]  And just absolutely just play into their hands.
[01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:09.763]  You know, when it comes to these optics.
[01:22:09.763 --> 01:22:19.811]  And as far as Trump is concerned, you know, from the very beginning, you know, I voted for Trump, you know, and I have been a supporter, but
[01:22:20.731 --> 01:22:35.460]  You know, me and my like-minded friends, we said from the very beginning that no matter what Trump does, you know, whether it's positive or negative, it's up to the people.
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:43.565]  You know, there was a spirit that was also dispatched with all of this, whether it was, you know, Trump ignited it when it came to
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:52.363]  There was also a spirit that kind of ignited in the people when it came, you know, to this movement that we have going on now.
[01:22:52.363 --> 01:22:59.286]  And, uh, you know, you look at the decision that you have, you know, are we going to vote for Trump?
[01:22:59.286 --> 01:23:00.307]  Are you going to vote for Biden?
[01:23:00.307 --> 01:23:02.188]  Of course I'm going to vote for Trump.
[01:23:02.188 --> 01:23:04.268]  Am I disappointed in his decisions right now?
[01:23:04.268 --> 01:23:04.549]  Yes.
[01:23:04.549 --> 01:23:09.511]  Am I disappointed in his rhetoric when it comes to COVID and the mask and all that?
[01:23:09.511 --> 01:23:10.951]  Absolutely.
[01:23:10.951 --> 01:23:14.393]  There's a bunch of stuff that Trump is doing that I'm disappointed in right now.
[01:23:15.433 --> 01:23:23.346]  But at the end of the day, we still come down to that decision of, I mean, there's no way I'm going to vote for Biden.
[01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:28.915]  But, you know, at the very end of the day, this comes down to the people.
[01:23:29.721 --> 01:23:31.861]  Well, and here's what it's going to come down to, Mark.
[01:23:31.861 --> 01:23:36.902]  There's going to be Trump supporters that are pissed because he's turned into a politician saying, oh, look, the economy's great.
[01:23:36.902 --> 01:23:39.643]  Oh, you're so sick of winning when it's not true.
[01:23:39.643 --> 01:23:41.703]  And so they're going to stay home to spite him.
[01:23:41.703 --> 01:23:46.144]  And then you're going to have people that just don't want to leave their homes because they don't want to leave a mask or they're afraid of getting shot or beat up.
[01:23:46.144 --> 01:23:47.404]  They won't go vote.
[01:23:47.404 --> 01:23:50.985]  So, I mean, look, this is a serious situation and all this campaign is boosting his ego.
[01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:56.446]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:23:56.446 --> 01:23:58.086]  You can wear them out to political events.
[01:23:58.086 --> 01:23:59.186]  You can trigger LibTards.
[01:23:59.764 --> 01:24:06.913]  One of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[01:24:06.913 --> 01:24:13.161]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[01:24:13.161 --> 01:24:18.748]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing of their openly.
[01:24:19.099 --> 01:24:19.420]  I think so.
[01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:34.713]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth masks that you're wearing.
[01:24:34.713 --> 01:24:38.536]  And the M95 masks only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[01:24:38.536 --> 01:24:40.618]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[01:24:40.618 --> 01:24:42.099]  They don't protect from it.
[01:24:42.099 --> 01:24:45.061]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks faces.
[01:24:45.061 --> 01:24:47.723]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[01:24:47.723 --> 01:24:48.704]  They're at cost.
[01:24:48.704 --> 01:24:51.046]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:24:51.046 --> 01:24:55.269]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[01:24:55.269 --> 01:24:59.432]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[01:24:59.432 --> 01:25:00.093]  We've gone over.
[01:25:00.455 --> 01:25:03.897]  Those purposes many times here on air.
[01:25:03.897 --> 01:25:09.961]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[01:25:09.961 --> 01:25:26.211]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[01:25:26.211 --> 01:25:29.673]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:33.380]  It's been pre-planned, organized, globally.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:35.641]  And it's extremely predatory.
[01:25:35.641 --> 01:25:47.424]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[01:25:47.424 --> 01:25:50.505]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[01:25:51.731 --> 01:25:59.912]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:26:01.212 --> 01:26:05.933]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[01:26:28.297 --> 01:26:28.977]  Yes.

[01:26:43.721 --> 01:26:46.521]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:26:46.521 --> 01:26:54.263]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:26:54.263 --> 01:26:56.944]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:15.666 --> 01:27:34.296]  Alright, let's go right back out to your phone calls.
[01:27:34.296 --> 01:27:37.598]  We've got Robert in North Carolina lined up ready to go.
[01:27:37.598 --> 01:27:38.778]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:27:38.778 --> 01:27:40.059]  The Alex Jones Show, go ahead.
[01:27:44.574 --> 01:27:49.818]  Robert going once, twice, three times, sold.
[01:27:49.818 --> 01:27:55.182]  Liberal in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:27:55.182 --> 01:28:09.032]  Hey Owen, I've listened to you over the past two years, just smirching the character of people that you call from the left, you call them idiots and such, and probably by the actions and words they probably do deserve it, but
[01:28:09.867 --> 01:28:17.373]  Y'all on the right, specifically yourself and Alex, with the exception of David Knight, y'all have been acting like abused wives.
[01:28:17.373 --> 01:28:25.078]  Donald Trump has been making statements and his actions are the total counter to what he has said.
[01:28:25.078 --> 01:28:35.366]  He spoke about red flag laws, but y'all are calling on him to help y'all when it comes to censorship, but he is now trying to align himself with big corporations like Google
[01:28:36.303 --> 01:28:40.606]  Well, now hold on a second.
[01:28:40.606 --> 01:28:41.886]  I report on that.
[01:28:41.886 --> 01:28:43.467]  I mean, I literally report on that.
[01:28:43.467 --> 01:28:46.389]  I literally complained about what you're talking about today.
[01:28:46.389 --> 01:28:49.871]  Dan Crenshaw, in fact, just sided with Pelosi on red flag laws.
[01:28:49.871 --> 01:28:53.113]  So, hey, look, I understand what you're saying overall as a point.
[01:28:53.113 --> 01:28:55.755]  I guess, why haven't I totally abandoned Trump?
[01:28:55.755 --> 01:29:00.778]  But to sit here and act like I don't cover it and say that you listen every day, I mean, that's just not true.
[01:29:03.065 --> 01:29:05.306]  I'm not stating that you don't cover it.
[01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:10.627]  What I'm stating is that you all are lukewarm, and this is something that Alex covers all the time.
[01:29:10.627 --> 01:29:13.928]  You can't be lukewarm, you have to take a side.
[01:29:13.928 --> 01:29:26.171]  When Trump, you all speak about why isn't Soros being investigated or why hasn't he been arrested, and when you take a look into the history of his organization or foundation,
[01:29:27.256 --> 01:29:33.678]  They are always paired with the NAD, which is the National Endowment for Democracy, and that's a CIA run front.
[01:29:33.678 --> 01:29:37.520]  They are always participating in color revolutions all over the world.
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:46.343]  And you'll expect the same guy that's backing these organizations to come and assist you and aid you all, which is why I call you all abuse wise here.
[01:29:46.343 --> 01:29:54.726]  You all have this unrealistic expectation that somehow his words will certainly mirror his actions, and his actions haven't done so.
[01:29:55.325 --> 01:29:58.287]  He spoke about not wanting vaccines when he first came in.
[01:29:58.287 --> 01:30:00.548]  I know he's a proponent for vaccines.
[01:30:00.548 --> 01:30:01.429]  I mean, I don't understand.
[01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:04.250]  I understand what you're saying, but you're just repeating what I've said.
[01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:07.632]  I've literally said everything you're saying on the air.
[01:30:07.632 --> 01:30:09.113]  So I don't know what your point is.
[01:30:09.113 --> 01:30:10.374]  I mean, what are you?
[01:30:10.374 --> 01:30:11.735]  What's your political ideology?
[01:30:11.735 --> 01:30:13.716]  Where are you coming from?
[01:30:13.716 --> 01:30:20.800]  Well, to be quite honest, I do call myself a liberal, but I am unbiased as of now.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:21.401]  I have seen
[01:30:22.282 --> 01:30:29.177]  Over the years that I've lived in this country, I've seen both political parties participate in a specific agenda that has moved on.
[01:30:29.177 --> 01:30:30.821]  They have given their followers...
[01:30:38.247 --> 01:30:46.972]  So let me ask you another question then, because I actually appreciate this conversation, and we may have different political ideologies or whatever.
[01:30:46.972 --> 01:30:49.174]  I like being able to talk to somebody that thinks differently.
[01:30:49.174 --> 01:30:55.658]  I like someone calling in and legitimately challenging me on my ideas and not just screaming obscenities or calling me curse names.
[01:30:55.658 --> 01:30:58.700]  So I appreciate what you're saying, liberal, but let me ask you this then, because I
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:00.301]  I completely get it.
[01:31:00.301 --> 01:31:01.323]  You're right.
[01:31:01.323 --> 01:31:02.585]  I'm a fool.
[01:31:02.585 --> 01:31:03.807]  Trump's fooled us all.
[01:31:03.807 --> 01:31:06.371]  Why should I have hope in Trump?
[01:31:06.371 --> 01:31:07.793]  But let me ask you this then.
[01:31:07.793 --> 01:31:13.261]  How do you explain how the entire corrupt establishment is against Trump?
[01:31:13.261 --> 01:31:14.143]  How do you explain that?
[01:31:15.433 --> 01:31:16.975]  I see this as theatre, Owen.
[01:31:16.975 --> 01:31:20.758]  Theatre for the idiots, theatre for the masters.
[01:31:20.758 --> 01:31:26.123]  And in order for... And the piece that you were speaking about earlier, what's this guy's name?
[01:31:26.123 --> 01:31:27.344]  Yuri Brezhnev.
[01:31:27.344 --> 01:31:30.607]  He speaks about it in that clip that you're talking about.
[01:31:30.607 --> 01:31:33.289]  In order to have society progress.
[01:31:33.289 --> 01:31:35.932]  And when I say progress, I'm saying quote unquote progress.
[01:31:36.536 --> 01:31:37.618]  Progress to what?
[01:31:37.618 --> 01:31:39.380]  You have to have two opposing forces.
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:41.703]  So they have created these two opposing forces.
[01:31:41.703 --> 01:31:46.390]  Those that are in the Trump camp and those that are firmly entrenched in the Democratic Party's camp.
[01:31:48.418 --> 01:31:50.340]  But that doesn't really answer my question.
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:54.522]  And you have to admit, though, InfoWars has never really been on a side of anything.
[01:31:54.522 --> 01:31:58.064]  I mean, when Republicans were in office, we were known as Bush-bashers.
[01:31:58.064 --> 01:32:00.406]  When Obama was in office, you know, we were anti-left.
[01:32:00.406 --> 01:32:03.188]  So, I mean, InfoWars has never really been on any side.
[01:32:03.188 --> 01:32:05.589]  I guess, you know, we had faith in Trump that he was going to be different.
[01:32:05.589 --> 01:32:07.470]  You say that we're fools for it.
[01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:08.971]  I'll accept that.
[01:32:08.971 --> 01:32:13.474]  But that doesn't really answer the question of how is the entire corrupt establishment against Trump?
[01:32:13.474 --> 01:32:14.555]  Are you saying it's all an act?
[01:32:15.931 --> 01:32:19.853]  Okay, it's a psychological one, and if you give me an opportunity, I'll answer it for you.
[01:32:19.853 --> 01:32:21.774]  It's psychological.
[01:32:21.774 --> 01:32:29.038]  They have made it seem as if everyone is anti-Trump, and what that does now is certainly solidify his base.
[01:32:29.038 --> 01:32:30.198]  Like, wow.
[01:32:30.198 --> 01:32:32.399]  Everyone is against him, so you know what?
[01:32:32.399 --> 01:32:33.200]  But that's what I'm saying, though.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.480]  You use that word, but hold on a second.
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.661]  You use that word, seem.
[01:32:35.661 --> 01:32:38.342]  So you're saying that really, Hollywood isn't anti-Trump?
[01:32:38.342 --> 01:32:40.503]  Really, all the media lying about him isn't anti-Trump?
[01:32:40.503 --> 01:32:41.324]  It's all just an act?
[01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:45.383]  You know when they're anti-constitution?
[01:32:45.383 --> 01:32:46.683]  That's what all of these people are.
[01:32:46.683 --> 01:32:48.804]  Well, I agree with that, and I think they're anti-reality.
[01:32:48.804 --> 01:32:57.846]  You know, it's funny you bring up the Constitution, because isn't it funny how we've got all these people, it's always convenient, like, oh, America's racist!
[01:32:57.846 --> 01:33:00.026]  The people that wrote the Constitution were slave owners!
[01:33:00.026 --> 01:33:01.007]  Burn it to the ground!
[01:33:01.007 --> 01:33:02.367]  Remove their statues!
[01:33:02.367 --> 01:33:06.288]  And then all of a sudden, when anything happens to them, oh, this is unconstitutional!
[01:33:06.288 --> 01:33:08.248]  You're denying my constitutional rights!
[01:33:08.248 --> 01:33:10.769]  I mean, isn't that hilarious how that's happening on the streets now?
[01:33:11.846 --> 01:33:16.849]  It is hilarious, and this is the thing, I don't listen to those idiots whatsoever.
[01:33:16.849 --> 01:33:26.514]  When it comes to people like that, and what I really call to talk about, yes I wanted to bring up that topic about Trump, but what I've been really wanting to speak about is Governor Cuomo here in New York.
[01:33:26.514 --> 01:33:29.656]  And I'm guessing you guys can pull this information up.
[01:33:29.656 --> 01:33:39.362]  On May 29, 2020, there's a headline in the New York Post titled, Governor Cuomo delays Phase 2 reopen for New York regions of raging officials.
[01:33:40.091 --> 01:33:50.813]  In the eighth paragraph down, out of his own mouth, Cuomo states that he is taking instructions from international experts with respect to reopening New York.
[01:33:50.813 --> 01:34:01.935]  And I would advise any small business owner living in the state of New York to take him to task on this, because he's the one responsible for keeping them shut down.
[01:34:01.935 --> 01:34:07.297]  Not even him, but so-called international organizations or international experts.
[01:34:07.297 --> 01:34:09.057]  And I want people to take him to task for that.
[01:34:10.442 --> 01:34:11.583]  Yeah, which is globalism.
[01:34:11.583 --> 01:34:12.983]  Hey, Liberal, I'd love to give you more time.
[01:34:12.983 --> 01:34:13.943]  This has been a great call.
[01:34:13.943 --> 01:34:17.024]  I just got full lines of people who have been waiting almost an hour.
[01:34:17.024 --> 01:34:17.905]  But you know what?
[01:34:17.905 --> 01:34:30.548]  I appreciate a caller like this, who calls me out on things that he thinks I'm wrong on, puts me on task with things I've said, and is someone from a different political leaning or ideology that can actually have a conversation.
[01:34:30.548 --> 01:34:33.669]  You see, this is what's missing in America right here.
[01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:35.450]  This is why America can't heal.
[01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.690]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:18.165]  I want to start off by saying right now I think we need to have faith and to be speaking faith-filled words right now unto the earth.
[01:35:18.165 --> 01:35:30.910]  The Lord showed me a while back that the world is going to be flooded with His anointing stronger than it's ever been before.
[01:35:33.434 --> 01:35:48.540]  Just staying positive and because I know it's hard to, you know, stay positive with everything that's going on and not talk negative, but I think that's a key part.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:36:00.605]  It's like the story with Ananias and it was said in the Bible that the anointing will be so strong that our shadows will be able to heal the sick.
[01:36:01.348 --> 01:36:08.051]  But with Ananias, he lied to Peter about selling his property.
[01:36:08.051 --> 01:36:16.596]  And he, you know, him and his wife dropped dead in the power of the Holy Ghost that was on the earth back then.
[01:36:16.596 --> 01:36:20.438]  Well, you know, we got to go to a break here and I want to just respond to what you said about being positive.
[01:36:20.438 --> 01:36:21.939]  You know, I completely agree.
[01:36:21.939 --> 01:36:24.020]  And, you know, the challenge is, look,
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:32.486]  I mean, I'm gonna step away from the mic for a couple days here to try to actually practice what Isaiah just said being positive.
[01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:34.008]  Here's the problem.
[01:36:34.008 --> 01:36:41.635]  You can't go anywhere now without the anti-you, anti-freedom, anti-American propaganda shoved in your face.
[01:36:41.635 --> 01:36:45.419]  The mask, the BLM, all the anti-Trump garbage.
[01:36:45.419 --> 01:36:48.682]  So it's hard not to let that upset you.
[01:36:51.189 --> 01:37:08.919]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020, the Democrats, as well as many Republican leaders, will be calling for the United Nations WHO edict that all Americans wear masks, be a quote, federal order and mandate.
[01:37:08.919 --> 01:37:12.401]  Totally unconstitutional, annihilating states' rights.
[01:37:13.522 --> 01:37:14.323]  Think about that.
[01:37:14.323 --> 01:37:16.446]  A woman can kill her baby.
[01:37:16.446 --> 01:37:18.849]  We pay for illegal aliens healthcare.
[01:37:18.849 --> 01:37:27.639]  But you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they said, even if you believe the official story.
[01:37:27.639 --> 01:37:30.903]  This is about the WHO, the globalists, testing their power.
[01:37:31.463 --> 01:37:36.345]  Through the media, over the federal government, to set policy in the United States.
[01:37:36.345 --> 01:37:41.628]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and all of it.
[01:37:41.628 --> 01:37:43.188]  And by the way, they admit that.
[01:37:43.188 --> 01:37:48.611]  They say, now your carbon's down one way or another, you stupid Americans.
[01:37:50.489 --> 01:38:00.813]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance, censorship with AI.
[01:38:00.813 --> 01:38:05.515]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[01:38:06.215 --> 01:38:14.577]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[01:38:14.577 --> 01:38:34.443]  And the good news is there are still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[01:38:35.103 --> 01:38:36.124]  Destinies.
[01:38:36.124 --> 01:38:43.068]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[01:38:43.068 --> 01:38:47.571]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[01:38:47.571 --> 01:38:51.994]  So take action, or be slaves!
[01:38:51.994 --> 01:38:53.375]  We are selling more.
[01:38:56.314 --> 01:39:07.825]  That we were previously selling in a month because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones even if you opt out of it or get rid of the apps.
[01:39:07.825 --> 01:39:14.171]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control your life.
[01:39:14.711 --> 01:39:15.131]  We're good.
[01:39:34.637 --> 01:39:36.418]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[01:40:03.812 --> 01:40:10.315]  Where did it come from?
[01:40:10.315 --> 01:40:15.697]  Infowarsstore.com We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.

[01:40:47.927 --> 01:40:54.308]  Other systems just don't compare.
[01:40:54.308 --> 01:40:56.909]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:01.638 --> 01:41:04.360]  Two of them.
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.001]  Alright.
[01:41:06.001 --> 01:41:09.343]  I'm not sure what he's doing out there.
[01:41:09.343 --> 01:41:14.726]  It looks like he's going to burn a flag and Rick Hyundai runs and takes it away from him.
[01:41:14.726 --> 01:41:19.689]  And so Monday, I think a guy was going to set fire to the American flag.
[01:41:19.689 --> 01:41:20.790]  Can you imagine that?
[01:41:33.353 --> 01:41:38.534]  Ladies and gentlemen, that was Dodgers Stadium, I believe.
[01:41:38.534 --> 01:41:42.136]  Cubs-Dodgers, I think it was 1973.
[01:41:42.136 --> 01:41:43.636]  Guys, fact check me on that.
[01:41:43.636 --> 01:41:49.778]  Rick Monday, entering the field of play, or leaving the field of play,
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:42:00.690]  In right field, sees a couple of Libtards getting ready to burn a flag in left field and he runs up, scoops up the flag before he can burn it.
[01:42:00.690 --> 01:42:06.455]  Vin Scully, the late great, the legend, calls it perfectly.
[01:42:07.591 --> 01:42:08.091]  Two of them.
[01:42:08.091 --> 01:42:08.291]  Alright.
[01:42:41.112 --> 01:42:43.033]  Oh, just beautiful.
[01:42:43.033 --> 01:42:45.934]  And then the crowd cheers for Rick Monday.
[01:42:45.934 --> 01:42:48.595]  They put on the Jumbotron, Rick Monday, great play.
[01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:49.636]  That was in LA!
[01:42:49.636 --> 01:42:50.976]  He was a Chicago Cubby!
[01:42:50.976 --> 01:42:51.056]  1976.
[01:42:51.056 --> 01:42:51.276]  Wow.
[01:43:12.363 --> 01:43:17.148]  Probably the greatest play in Cubs history right there.
[01:43:17.148 --> 01:43:18.289]  Alright.
[01:43:18.289 --> 01:43:19.030]  And then Vince Gulley.
[01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:21.493]  Can you imagine burning an American flag?
[01:43:21.493 --> 01:43:22.154]  Unbelievable!
[01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:28.531]  The average, you know, the average broad, in fact, you know what, I won't even say this until I'll be honest because I know a lot of these guys personally.
[01:43:28.531 --> 01:43:32.872]  Honestly, most of them either are politically uninvolved or conservative folks.
[01:43:32.872 --> 01:43:35.293]  In fact, I'll actually be honest with you.
[01:43:35.293 --> 01:43:42.895]  I've walked into multiple broadcast booths when guys are doing their prep work and they're listening to InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[01:43:42.895 --> 01:43:43.535]  Okay, so.
[01:43:44.375 --> 01:43:49.118]  I've also had fisticuffs with some guys in radio booths because they're liberals and I'm conservative.
[01:43:49.118 --> 01:43:51.019]  Now it was all in good fun.
[01:43:51.019 --> 01:43:54.201]  But man, we are a far cry from that.
[01:43:54.201 --> 01:44:00.404]  Now you'll probably have an American flag burning ceremony before every game, which is essentially the Black Lives Matter ceremony.
[01:44:00.404 --> 01:44:02.806]  All right, let's go back out to your phone calls.
[01:44:02.806 --> 01:44:09.049]  By the way, we're going to air coming up, before Andrew Torbut joins me, the former Russian KGB agent.
[01:44:09.049 --> 01:44:10.710]  It's just so powerful, folks.
[01:44:10.710 --> 01:44:12.471]  We'll upload the video on Bandai Video too.
[01:44:12.471 --> 01:44:13.352]  We're going to play that coming up.
[01:44:14.294 --> 01:44:16.036]  Let's go back out to the phone lines for the time being.
[01:44:16.036 --> 01:44:17.557]  Austin in Virginia.
[01:44:17.557 --> 01:44:20.239]  Austin, go ahead.
[01:44:20.239 --> 01:44:22.281]  Hey Owen, I really love your show.
[01:44:22.281 --> 01:44:27.204]  I just wanted to say I used to be an anarchist when I lived in Denver.
[01:44:27.204 --> 01:44:31.027]  I blame half of it on liberal indoctrination, so that's what I want to talk about.
[01:44:31.027 --> 01:44:33.009]  Did you go to Denver U?
[01:44:33.009 --> 01:44:33.529]  No, no.
[01:44:33.529 --> 01:44:35.131]  I didn't go to college.
[01:44:35.131 --> 01:44:37.052]  It's in the high school.
[01:44:37.052 --> 01:44:43.117]  They teach that we're on stolen land, but what they fail to mention is all the land was stolen at one point until capitalism was invented.
[01:44:43.757 --> 01:44:49.622]  But anyways, I wanted to talk about these GoFundMes, man, because George Floyd, we all know what he did.
[01:44:49.622 --> 01:44:51.904]  He solicited individual cigarettes.
[01:44:51.904 --> 01:44:53.665]  He committed fraud and resisted arrest.
[01:44:53.665 --> 01:44:54.946]  Died a criminal.
[01:44:54.946 --> 01:44:55.767]  He's a millionaire.
[01:44:55.767 --> 01:44:58.409]  He's got $20 million in his GoFundMe.
[01:44:58.409 --> 01:45:02.072]  Oh, not only that, not only that, Austin, I'm glad you brought this up because I was thinking about this, too.
[01:45:02.072 --> 01:45:05.795]  Like, I mean, look, I really want to I really want to get along with everybody.
[01:45:05.795 --> 01:45:06.896]  I really want to heal America.
[01:45:06.896 --> 01:45:13.121]  And I'm thinking, like, how do you even talk to a George Floyd protester who really thinks he was just outright murdered by a police officer?
[01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:15.401]  He was hopped up on drugs.
[01:45:15.401 --> 01:45:16.822]  He was committing crimes.
[01:45:16.822 --> 01:45:19.042]  He asked them to take them out.
[01:45:19.042 --> 01:45:20.203]  This all came out in the transcripts.
[01:45:20.203 --> 01:45:21.183]  Nobody covered it.
[01:45:21.183 --> 01:45:29.785]  Floyd foaming at the mouth on drugs, banging his head against the car window, asked to be removed from the car so he could lay down.
[01:45:29.785 --> 01:45:32.366]  I mean, but they don't cover any of that.
[01:45:32.366 --> 01:45:33.306]  And yeah, you're right.
[01:45:33.306 --> 01:45:35.387]  They get millions.
[01:45:36.387 --> 01:45:41.091]  Millions of dollars donated to all their GoFundMes, whether it's Floyd or any of these other people.
[01:45:41.091 --> 01:45:43.053]  They just get millions pouring in.
[01:45:43.053 --> 01:45:46.897]  So yeah, you know, but it's not just Floyd.
[01:45:46.897 --> 01:45:48.998]  It's like, I don't even know how they do this.
[01:45:48.998 --> 01:45:54.023]  It's like literally they set up GoFundMe and they get millions of dollars overnight.
[01:45:54.023 --> 01:45:54.323]  Yep.
[01:45:54.323 --> 01:45:59.588]  I also wanted to mention that Jessica Doty Whitaker, her GoFundMe has less than $100,000 in it.
[01:45:59.588 --> 01:46:01.950]  The white mother who got shot saying all lives matter.
[01:46:02.443 --> 01:46:03.603]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[01:46:03.603 --> 01:46:10.366]  And the Portland, Oregon Antifa protester, or rioter, they should call it, bail and bond fund, has almost a million dollars in it.
[01:46:10.366 --> 01:46:20.450]  And I did some research, I looked up some donors, three different names, three different people, all college professors, one in New York, one in Texas, one in California.
[01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:25.972]  We see where the money's at, we need to stop this liberal indoctrination, because that's where the problem's coming from.
[01:46:25.972 --> 01:46:29.334]  Yeah, and see, this is like, these are drastic measures, folks, but
[01:46:31.052 --> 01:46:35.756]  And it looks like the money for Whitaker has actually gone up, at least since you checked, it's up to $85,000.
[01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:41.742]  But still, you know, George Floyd, the criminal, you know, he brings in a record amount of donations for GoFundMe.
[01:46:41.742 --> 01:46:42.843]  But it's all about promotion.
[01:46:42.843 --> 01:46:47.708]  It's all about the media and how they control the whole thing and have everybody brainwashed.
[01:46:47.708 --> 01:46:51.191]  And then they literally give $10 to George Floyd or whatever and they think they just saved the world.
[01:46:51.191 --> 01:46:52.472]  They feel empowered by it.
[01:46:52.472 --> 01:46:55.355]  They have no idea how they've just been totally deceived.
[01:46:55.355 --> 01:46:56.216]  Anything else, Austin?
[01:46:56.934 --> 01:46:57.634]  Nope, that was it.
[01:46:57.634 --> 01:47:00.876]  We just need to get out there and we need to support the Whitaker family.
[01:47:00.876 --> 01:47:02.798]  They deserve more from us, conservatives.
[01:47:02.798 --> 01:47:03.318]  So, that's it.
[01:47:03.318 --> 01:47:04.259]  Really love your show, Owen.
[01:47:04.259 --> 01:47:05.159]  Thank you.
[01:47:05.159 --> 01:47:05.519]  Thank you.
[01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:08.901]  Yeah, there is the GoFundMe right there.
[01:47:08.901 --> 01:47:11.203]  But, you know, her life doesn't matter.
[01:47:11.203 --> 01:47:12.364]  It's just so sad, folks.
[01:47:12.364 --> 01:47:15.425]  I mean, look.
[01:47:15.425 --> 01:47:16.126]  I don't know what you do.
[01:47:16.126 --> 01:47:20.348]  I really don't know how you can reason with these George Floyd protesters.
[01:47:20.348 --> 01:47:22.170]  The simple answer is you can't.
[01:47:22.967 --> 01:47:24.929]  And so I don't know what to do with them.
[01:47:24.929 --> 01:47:26.370]  They're lost.
[01:47:26.370 --> 01:47:27.010]  They're lost.
[01:47:27.010 --> 01:47:28.892]  They don't want to be connected to humanity.
[01:47:28.892 --> 01:47:30.613]  They don't want to be connected to reality.
[01:47:30.613 --> 01:47:32.014]  They don't want to be connected to God.
[01:47:32.014 --> 01:47:34.056]  They're so drunk on hatred.
[01:47:34.056 --> 01:47:39.460]  They're so under mind control.
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:40.501]  It's a fact, folks.
[01:47:40.501 --> 01:47:47.526]  More black lives have died because of Black Lives Matter than lives that have been saved.
[01:47:47.526 --> 01:47:50.549]  Tell me one black life that's been saved by Black Lives Matter.
[01:47:50.549 --> 01:47:50.869]  You can't.
[01:47:52.554 --> 01:47:59.940]  But you've had at least 20 black people dead, killed during a Black Lives Matter riot.
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.602]  But then the media covers it all and says it's a peaceful protest.
[01:48:02.602 --> 01:48:04.463]  I mean, it's sick, man.
[01:48:04.463 --> 01:48:05.004]  It's sick.
[01:48:05.004 --> 01:48:07.045]  And it's all by design, by the way.
[01:48:07.045 --> 01:48:09.207]  And, you know, Alex Jones wasn't the only person that knew it.
[01:48:09.207 --> 01:48:12.269]  He was just the only one in American media brave enough to report on it.
[01:48:12.269 --> 01:48:18.675]  But we're going to play up a clip coming up from a 1984 interview with a Russian KGB agent that just...
[01:48:19.811 --> 01:48:26.034]  I want to play it because, well I work for Russia obviously, but no, just because it's so shocking because it just hits home.
[01:48:26.034 --> 01:48:28.475]  It just makes you realize the attack we're under.
[01:48:28.475 --> 01:48:33.217]  Alright, Christine in California, you're on the Alex Jones Show, go ahead.
[01:48:33.217 --> 01:48:41.361]  Hi, well regarding Trump's remarks about Maxwell or anybody else, excuse me,
[01:48:42.037 --> 01:48:48.663]  His stock and trade, part of his way of dealing with people and his career is being charming, okay?
[01:48:48.663 --> 01:48:50.424]  Which is disarming.
[01:48:50.424 --> 01:48:57.090]  And a lot of times you'd be talking about somebody who's such a wonderful person, when he hires them and stuff, and he's fired them a week later.
[01:48:57.090 --> 01:49:05.757]  And I think it's part of a point, it's also a good way to avoid lining yourself up for some libel lawsuit or something.
[01:49:05.757 --> 01:49:08.839]  But these people have known him a long time.
[01:49:08.839 --> 01:49:10.701]  He's been around them, he knows what they're up to.
[01:49:11.451 --> 01:49:16.632]  What's-her-name, Hillary, had reportedly said that if he gets elected, we'll all be hung.
[01:49:16.632 --> 01:49:21.153]  So, they know he's not reliable to them.
[01:49:21.153 --> 01:49:28.494]  Now, he was probably throwing them some bones and appointing those people who were swamp rats themselves.
[01:49:28.494 --> 01:49:33.355]  And, uh, confusing them or slowing down some decision to try to assassinate him or something.
[01:49:33.355 --> 01:49:38.816]  But, um, I wouldn't give up on him, but I wouldn't treat him or anybody else as the Messiah either.
[01:49:39.628 --> 01:49:52.277]  But if it is just the usual game where the Democrats are driving a train taking us to hell fast and the Republicans driving a train taking us to hell slowly, it's easier to jump off a slower moving train.
[01:49:52.277 --> 01:49:57.440]  So I'd still, I would still go Trump, but that's now on the masks.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:07.667]  Here's the thing, the concept of protect is a very CDC document that's quoted and shown on air on your show and probably elsewhere that says that the masks don't protect.
[01:50:08.126 --> 01:50:16.212]  In the same sentence it says, stop buying them up and leave some for the people who need them, the emergency responders and the medical people.
[01:50:16.212 --> 01:50:22.096]  The thing is, the only real protection, which is an absolute thing, is a hazmat suit.
[01:50:22.096 --> 01:50:29.962]  I mean a real one, not, I mean the type for dealing with biowares, not the sort they'll get up to clean a really filthy house.
[01:50:29.962 --> 01:50:34.746]  So, what we're talking about here is partial protection.
[01:50:35.416 --> 01:50:39.018]  And now, um... Well, look, they can protect us all day long.
[01:50:39.018 --> 01:50:41.899]  I mean, they could mandate you wear a condom during sex.
[01:50:41.899 --> 01:50:43.160]  No, they can't.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.361]  Well, it's for protection.
[01:50:44.361 --> 01:50:47.962]  They could mandate you wear a helmet, you know, during a hailstorm.
[01:50:47.962 --> 01:50:48.683]  Well, no, you can't.
[01:50:48.683 --> 01:50:50.143]  Well, it's for protection.
[01:50:50.143 --> 01:50:52.044]  No, it's all about freedom, to me.
[01:50:52.044 --> 01:50:57.627]  And for statewide mask mandates to be going into place across the nation is just... it's just abhorrent.
[01:50:57.627 --> 01:50:59.408]  Thank you for the call, Christine.
[01:50:59.408 --> 01:51:00.829]  Alright, folks, when we come back,
[01:51:01.869 --> 01:51:06.493]  We're going to air the video of the former Russian KGB agent laying it all out perfectly.
[01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:09.975]  It's just... I mean, it just makes it more real.
[01:51:09.975 --> 01:51:13.418]  And we'll also get Andrew Tober on.
[01:51:13.418 --> 01:51:15.499]  But you know, here's the thing about with the Trump deal.
[01:51:15.499 --> 01:51:20.263]  Folks, this isn't like an ego thing or anything.
[01:51:20.263 --> 01:51:22.285]  It's not trying to take credit away from Trump.
[01:51:22.285 --> 01:51:27.729]  If it wasn't for this audience and InfoWars, Trump would have not made it out of the RNC.
[01:51:27.729 --> 01:51:30.891]  He would have not made it out of the Republican nomination process.
[01:51:30.891 --> 01:51:31.091]  So...
[01:51:32.298 --> 01:51:40.304]  There's just, like, an added pressure of making sure we do the right thing in these perilous times.
[01:51:40.304 --> 01:51:51.113]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[01:51:51.113 --> 01:52:00.320]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:14.848]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[01:52:14.848 --> 01:52:29.057]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[01:52:29.517 --> 01:52:31.201]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[01:52:31.201 --> 01:52:37.895]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[01:52:37.895 --> 01:52:39.719]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[01:52:42.363 --> 01:52:57.777]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings, standing on top of an American flag, is Nazi!
[01:52:57.777 --> 01:53:05.264]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-check it and say, yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazi.
[01:53:05.644 --> 01:53:05.804]  No.
[01:53:35.604 --> 01:53:36.665]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:53:49.431 --> 01:53:54.713]  Mr. Besmionov was born in 1939 in a suburb of Moscow.
[01:53:54.713 --> 01:53:58.495]  He was the son of a high-ranking Soviet Army officer.
[01:53:58.495 --> 01:54:06.378]  He was educated in the elite schools inside the Soviet Union and became an expert in Indian culture and Indian languages.
[01:54:06.378 --> 01:54:15.102]  He had an outstanding career with Novosti, which was the, and still is, I should say, the press arm or the press agency of the Soviet Union.
[01:54:15.102 --> 01:54:17.823]  It turns out that this is also a front for the KGB.
[01:54:19.417 --> 01:54:27.965]  He escaped to the West in 1970 after becoming totally disgusted with the Soviet system, and he did this at great risk to his life.
[01:54:27.965 --> 01:54:34.731]  He certainly is one of the world's outstanding experts on the subject of Soviet propaganda and disinformation and active measures.
[01:54:35.964 --> 01:54:39.848]  Well, you spoke several times before about ideological subversion.
[01:54:39.848 --> 01:54:44.393]  That is a phrase that I'm afraid some Americans don't fully understand.
[01:54:44.393 --> 01:54:50.159]  When the Soviets use the phrase ideological subversion, what do they mean by it?
[01:54:50.159 --> 01:54:53.142]  Ideological subversion is the slow process
[01:54:53.996 --> 01:55:04.186]  Which we call either ideological subversion, or active measures, or psychological warfare.
[01:55:04.186 --> 01:55:18.819]  What it basically means is to change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite of the abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions
[01:55:19.798 --> 01:55:25.941]  in the interest of defending themselves, their families, their community and their country.
[01:55:25.941 --> 01:55:35.465]  It's a great brainwashing process which goes very slow and it's divided in four basic stages.
[01:55:35.465 --> 01:55:37.646]  The first one being demoralization.
[01:55:37.646 --> 01:55:41.167]  It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation.
[01:55:41.167 --> 01:55:42.788]  Why that many years?
[01:55:42.788 --> 01:55:48.871]  Because this is the minimum number of years which requires to educate one generation of students
[01:55:50.089 --> 01:55:56.414]  in the country of your enemy, exposed to the ideology of the enemy.
[01:55:56.414 --> 01:56:10.266]  In other words, Marxism-Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generations of American students without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of Americanism, American patriotism.
[01:56:11.454 --> 01:56:19.637]  The demoralization process in the United States is basically completed already for the last 25 years.
[01:56:19.637 --> 01:56:32.361]  Actually, it's overfulfilled because demoralization now reaches such areas where previously not even Comrade Andropov and all his experts would even dream of such a tremendous success.
[01:56:33.081 --> 01:56:38.385]  Most of it is done by Americans to Americans, thanks to lack of moral standards.
[01:56:38.385 --> 01:56:45.411]  As I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter anymore.
[01:56:45.411 --> 01:56:50.455]  A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information.
[01:56:50.455 --> 01:56:54.058]  The facts tell nothing to him.
[01:56:54.058 --> 01:56:59.302]  Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures,
[01:57:00.402 --> 01:57:12.375]  Even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him concentration camp, he will refuse to believe it until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom.
[01:57:12.375 --> 01:57:17.260]  When a military boot crashes his balls, then he will understand, but not before that.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:19.702]  That's the tragedy of the situation of demoralization.
[01:57:21.007 --> 01:57:23.550]  The next stage is destabilization.
[01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:29.155]  This time, subverter does not care about your ideas and the patterns of your consumption.
[01:57:29.155 --> 01:57:33.119]  Whether you eat junk food and get fat and flabby doesn't matter anymore.
[01:57:33.119 --> 01:57:41.368]  This time, and it takes only from two to five years to destabilize a nation, what matters is essentials.
[01:57:41.368 --> 01:57:44.171]  Economy, foreign relations, defense systems.
[01:57:45.915 --> 01:58:01.332]  And you can see it quite clearly that in some areas, in such sensitive areas as defense and economy, the influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas in the United States is absolutely fantastic.
[01:58:01.332 --> 01:58:08.019]  I could never believe it 14 years ago when I landed in this part of the world that the process will go that fast.
[01:58:09.586 --> 01:58:11.707]  The next stage, of course, is crisis.
[01:58:11.707 --> 01:58:16.510]  It may take only up to six weeks to bring a country to the verge of crisis.
[01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:19.272]  You can see it in Central America now.
[01:58:19.272 --> 01:58:26.536]  And after crisis, with a violent change of power, structure, and economy, you have so-called the period of normalization.
[01:58:26.536 --> 01:58:34.180]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have uploaded the full video to Band.Video from Yuri Benzimov in 1984.
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:34.320]  I mean...
[01:58:36.792 --> 01:58:38.697]  No, I play that because I'm a Russian agent.
[01:58:38.697 --> 01:58:43.371]  No, I play that because it's right and it's all happening before our eyes.
[01:58:43.371 --> 01:58:45.075]  And it's time to wake up.
[01:58:49.602 --> 01:58:51.043]  It's Christmas in July.
[01:58:51.043 --> 01:58:52.263]  We ran the sale last year.
[01:58:52.263 --> 01:58:54.024]  It was very, very popular.
[01:58:54.024 --> 01:59:00.308]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[01:59:00.308 --> 01:59:05.230]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[01:59:05.230 --> 01:59:11.453]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[01:59:11.453 --> 01:59:14.115]  And the shirts are on sale right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:15.256 --> 01:59:21.366]  I got the idea from the Trump campaign of having a similar shirt to media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[01:59:21.366 --> 01:59:26.034]  And since it's so triggering to the leftists and the globalists, well, we're gonna make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:27.060]  I think so.
[02:00:02.927 --> 02:00:07.831]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:00:07.831 --> 02:00:09.912]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.912 --> 02:00:13.555]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:00:13.555 --> 02:00:23.542]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic Party has been the party of racism for almost a hundred years now.
[02:00:23.542 --> 02:00:24.823]  And they're bringing it back.
[02:00:24.823 --> 02:00:26.725]  The Democrats are bringing racism back.
[02:00:28.385 --> 02:00:36.047]  Story in the New York Times, podcast coming from the New York Times, nice white parents.
[02:00:36.047 --> 02:00:44.810]  And the entire podcast is about how white people and white parents have destroyed America's education system.
[02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:45.931]  Wow.
[02:00:45.931 --> 02:00:48.772]  Talk about just being openly racist.
[02:00:48.772 --> 02:00:52.893]  And again, folks, it's not even about race.
[02:00:52.893 --> 02:00:55.714]  But like, for example, you have Josh Hawley, who again today,
[02:00:56.912 --> 02:01:07.468]  says still waiting to hear back from the Smithsonian on the absurd and offensive chart that they released basically saying you saw the chart about white heritage and everything and you know
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:10.181]  They won't tell you how that got there.
[02:01:10.181 --> 02:01:12.501]  Well, how did this racism get on the New York Times?
[02:01:12.501 --> 02:01:13.062]  Here's the thing, though.
[02:01:13.062 --> 02:01:13.882]  It's not even about race.
[02:01:13.882 --> 02:01:28.267]  I mean, you could sit here and make it about race, but if you're gonna say that the Western education system is designed and made by white people, then you'd have to give them credit for the best education system on the planet until the left got in control of it and destroyed it!
[02:01:29.997 --> 02:01:31.437]  You can go look.
[02:01:31.437 --> 02:01:37.318]  In any Democrat-run area, just like the violence, you have the degradation of education.
[02:01:37.318 --> 02:01:43.539]  Dilapidated schools, unmotivated teachers, that's all in Democrat-run cities.
[02:01:43.539 --> 02:01:50.540]  You go out to a conservative area, Republican area, and you look at their schools and their kids, you can make it about race if you want.
[02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:51.321]  It's not.
[02:01:51.321 --> 02:01:57.042]  It's about leadership and ideology, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:57.042 --> 02:01:59.042]  So, that's what's going on.
[02:01:59.042 --> 02:01:59.182]  Now,
[02:02:00.413 --> 02:02:01.715]  Andrew Torba is with us.
[02:02:01.715 --> 02:02:04.339]  Of course, the creator of Gab.
[02:02:06.403 --> 02:02:16.686]  In competition with Twitter, before it was trending, understood the censorship of Twitter was inevitable, so he created gab.com, dissenter.com.
[02:02:16.686 --> 02:02:21.947]  They also have Gab Trends to try to replace where Drudge has failed us.
[02:02:21.947 --> 02:02:26.269]  Andrew Torba is with us now.
[02:02:26.269 --> 02:02:33.290]  You know, Andrew, there's so much to talk about, the censorship, the attacks on our cities.
[02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:34.871]  What do you want to get into to start today?
[02:02:38.988 --> 02:02:47.976]  This week, so I don't think people understand just how powerful and influential the search results are from Google.
[02:02:47.976 --> 02:02:53.801]  And, you know, there are numerous studies out there that show that it absolutely has an impact on election results.
[02:02:53.801 --> 02:02:55.923]  It sways votes, it sways public opinion.
[02:02:56.763 --> 02:03:10.490]  That video that you played before is really a great example of what is going on today with big tech where they try to demoralize, they try to eliminate any source of alternative information like InfoWars, like Gab, like others.
[02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:23.656]  So, you know, on, I think it was Monday or Tuesday, I woke up and, you know, was running a search for Gab and noticed that even if you search for our website, the actual Gab.com, you search Gab.com and it would not appear.
[02:03:24.272 --> 02:03:29.803]  So, you know, I started searching some other sites too, like InfoWars, Breitbart, etc., and none of us appeared.
[02:03:30.362 --> 02:03:36.046]  So this story started breaking and inevitably Josh Hawley and some others covered the story.
[02:03:36.046 --> 02:03:38.627]  Paul Joseph Watson covered it on Summit News, etc.
[02:03:38.627 --> 02:03:45.291]  And then all of a sudden, magically, you know, this quote unquote glitch, as Google called it, just suddenly stopped happening.
[02:03:45.291 --> 02:03:57.379]  So, you know, it appears that we've surfaced a new blacklist here of pretty much every conservative and alt media company and website on the planet that was just totally blacklisted for
[02:03:57.819 --> 02:03:58.019]  I think?
[02:04:16.622 --> 02:04:26.189]  You know, CNN and others, you know, were still appearing in the search results, but Breitbart, Daily Caller, InfoWars, Gab, we were all totally blacklisted.
[02:04:26.189 --> 02:04:31.133]  You could actually search the exact domain and you wouldn't find the results.
[02:04:31.133 --> 02:04:33.355]  It was really something to see, and it's really scary.
[02:04:33.355 --> 02:04:35.877]  And they claim they fixed it, but I don't believe that at all, because...
[02:04:36.537 --> 02:04:56.456]  I went to search for the story about the Black Lives Matter supporter kneeling on that baby's neck, and then the teacher saying, lean in more, kill that baby, because it's white, and I know that Gateway Pundit covered it, I know that InfoWars had a story, I know that National File had a story, and I was just, you know,
[02:04:57.677 --> 02:05:02.901]  I just plugged it into a search engine and I assumed that it would pop up on Google because it's exactly their headline.
[02:05:02.901 --> 02:05:03.641]  I know they covered it.
[02:05:03.641 --> 02:05:04.622]  I put in their name.
[02:05:04.622 --> 02:05:05.903]  It didn't show up!
[02:05:05.903 --> 02:05:07.064]  It didn't even show up.
[02:05:07.064 --> 02:05:08.605]  I had to go right to their website to find it.
[02:05:08.605 --> 02:05:21.434]  Now, ironically enough, what did show up was you've got a bunch of, you know, third-party sites now that are just people making sites that just republish news, basically, and that all still showed up.
[02:05:22.239 --> 02:05:40.502]  So you can clearly tell, we know this, but they've picked out specific URLs, they put them on a blacklist, and it's all done for political purposes, either run by China or run by the Democrat Party or both, and they've been caught red-handed.
[02:05:40.502 --> 02:05:42.683]  And then they just say, oh, it's a technical error.
[02:05:42.683 --> 02:05:45.323]  Yeah, the technical error is you did it on purpose.
[02:05:45.323 --> 02:05:46.684]  Your technicians did it on purpose.
[02:05:46.684 --> 02:05:48.224]  Your technical error is you did it on purpose.
[02:05:49.184 --> 02:05:51.025]  Right, yeah, there's no error there.
[02:05:51.025 --> 02:06:09.914]  It's done with intent, and it's done to bury stories like that story that you mentioned and others from being surfaced, you know, because they know people are using Google to try and find these stories, and they make it next to near impossible to find not only the stories, but also the sites that cover those stories, like InfoWars, you know, like Gab.
[02:06:09.914 --> 02:06:18.759]  And what they do instead is they, you know, prop up the Wikipedia smear articles about Gab, about InfoWars, about Breitbart, about others.
[02:06:19.219 --> 02:06:24.481]  So that the only information that you can find is negative information, is smeared information.
[02:06:24.481 --> 02:06:27.602]  And then, you know, we go and try to, you know, edit that.
[02:06:27.602 --> 02:06:32.084]  We try to create some form of objectivity on those pages.
[02:06:32.084 --> 02:06:33.084]  And it's not even us, right?
[02:06:33.084 --> 02:06:35.025]  Our users will go and try and do this.
[02:06:35.025 --> 02:06:43.648]  And, you know, the pages are camped on by people who openly admit that they are Antifa, people openly admit that they are communists, and they just sit on the page all day.
[02:06:45.094 --> 02:06:47.336]  They have the highest ranks in Wikipedia.
[02:06:47.336 --> 02:06:48.417]  They're Wikipedia admins.
[02:06:48.417 --> 02:06:49.798]  They're high-level editors.
[02:06:49.798 --> 02:06:50.758]  And that's all they do all day.
[02:06:50.758 --> 02:06:59.164]  They sit there all day and camp on the page and don't let anybody change anything to be anywhere near any level of objectivity.
[02:06:59.164 --> 02:07:01.566]  It has to be just totally smeared, the whole page.
[02:07:02.146 --> 02:07:09.992]  And you know, that's that's one of the reasons right now that we're working on improving our search because we want people to be able to discover this type of news.
[02:07:09.992 --> 02:07:16.416]  So with Gab Trends, we've been collecting millions and millions and millions of articles for the past year and a half.
[02:07:16.416 --> 02:07:18.358]  So we have so much data on news.
[02:07:19.018 --> 02:07:33.584]  That we could help surface and help people discover that Google is just totally burying from sites like InfoWars, from sites like Breitbart, and from sites like Gab where you're not going to find this information anywhere else just because it's buried and it's hidden from view.
[02:07:33.584 --> 02:07:39.087]  And we have to do a real investigation into Google because I actually did a little digging into this last night.
[02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:46.475]  Um, so, still in China, Google's technically not allowed in China right now.
[02:07:46.475 --> 02:07:52.800]  The only search engine that's allowed in China is the official Chinese Communist State search engine.
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:55.943]  And so obviously you know the control that they have.
[02:07:55.943 --> 02:07:58.244]  And so, what's been going on is,
[02:07:59.423 --> 02:07:59.863]  I don't think so.
[02:08:15.538 --> 02:08:20.900]  Is just bring Google to China and they're just showing China, hey look, we can censor too.
[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:22.400]  Hey look, we know how to censor.
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:24.721]  Hey, we can do propaganda as good as anybody else.
[02:08:24.721 --> 02:08:28.222]  Just let us do Google there and forget about Dragonfly.
[02:08:28.222 --> 02:08:31.884]  Now, I'm not sure if that's because they don't want to rebrand themselves or if that's because
[02:08:33.124 --> 02:08:39.490]  Dragonfly has already been called out on the floor of Congress and they denied it and so then they would just be caught in perjury again.
[02:08:39.490 --> 02:08:42.473]  But that's the investigation that needs to happen.
[02:08:42.473 --> 02:08:49.299]  What kind of communication is happening between the Chinese communist and Sundar Pichai and Google?
[02:08:49.299 --> 02:08:58.087]  We know they've lied to Congress, we know they've lied under oath, but how much involvement do they have directly with China and how much are they catering their search results for China?
[02:08:59.363 --> 02:09:00.304]  Well, it's probably a lot.
[02:09:00.304 --> 02:09:09.693]  I mean, you see Google and Apple allowing apps like Zoom, allowing apps like TikTok to skyrocket to massive success on their app stores.
[02:09:09.693 --> 02:09:14.397]  And these are basically data mining apps for the Communist Chinese government.
[02:09:14.397 --> 02:09:15.258]  So you're right.
[02:09:15.258 --> 02:09:17.380]  I think it almost seems like it's a sales pitch, but
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:19.281]  It's more nefarious than that, right?
[02:09:19.281 --> 02:09:21.122]  It's more so about the election.
[02:09:21.122 --> 02:09:32.247]  It's about controlling the flow of information and obviously retaining the power that they have over that flow of information and over the internet in general.
[02:09:32.247 --> 02:09:35.749]  So it does seem like a sales pitch, but I think it's more obvious than that.
[02:09:35.749 --> 02:09:37.330]  It's just about them retaining control.
[02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:43.311]  And folks, they really just look at you like cattle, and so they don't give a damn about you.
[02:09:43.311 --> 02:09:47.752]  That's why they want to get into China, because there's three billion more cattle members they can rattle up.
[02:09:47.752 --> 02:09:51.393]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller.
[02:09:51.393 --> 02:10:01.935]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price, because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it.
[02:10:01.935 --> 02:10:04.756]  And my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[02:10:05.356 --> 02:10:07.437]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[02:10:07.437 --> 02:10:09.018]  They're getting great responses.
[02:10:09.018 --> 02:10:10.739]  They're giving us incredible reviews.
[02:10:10.739 --> 02:10:14.101]  Because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does.
[02:10:14.101 --> 02:10:16.282]  Take it under the tongue where it's more absorbable.
[02:10:16.282 --> 02:10:18.344]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[02:10:18.344 --> 02:10:20.105]  Helps make DNA.
[02:10:20.105 --> 02:10:22.206]  Help the body produce more energy.
[02:10:22.466 --> 02:10:22.786]  Thank you.

[02:11:50.329 --> 02:11:52.970]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:11:59.051 --> 02:12:01.733]  Last year, we served over 3 trillion searches.
[02:12:01.733 --> 02:12:09.617]  And just as a fact, every single day, 15% of the searches Google sees, we have never seen them before.
[02:12:09.617 --> 02:12:13.199]  So this is working at scale.
[02:12:13.199 --> 02:12:20.224]  And we don't manually intervene on any particular search result.
[02:12:20.224 --> 02:12:23.245]  Oh, that is called perjury.
[02:12:23.245 --> 02:12:24.006]  Jail.
[02:12:24.006 --> 02:12:24.706]  Arrest.
[02:12:24.706 --> 02:12:25.327]  Immediately.
[02:12:29.588 --> 02:12:33.713]  He's a pretender, alright.
[02:12:33.713 --> 02:12:39.941]  You know, this is what's so frustrating.
[02:12:39.941 --> 02:12:45.048]  All I do is stand on the Capitol grounds with my mouth taped and I spent 27 hours in a jail cell.
[02:12:47.307 --> 02:13:04.203]  That multi-millionaire foreign operative Chinese communist wang sucker gets up there and commits perjury and not a single law enforcement officer, not a single Department of Justice official even blinks their eyes.
[02:13:04.203 --> 02:13:06.505]  Pathetic!
[02:13:06.505 --> 02:13:08.227]  Pathetic!
[02:13:10.387 --> 02:13:12.007]  That right there, that's a crime!
[02:13:12.007 --> 02:13:13.048]  You get arrested!
[02:13:13.048 --> 02:13:14.928]  You get your hands cuffed!
[02:13:14.928 --> 02:13:17.489]  You get 27 hours overnight in a jail!
[02:13:17.489 --> 02:13:20.929]  You get full punishment of the law!
[02:13:20.929 --> 02:13:29.091]  But Sundar Pichai gets up there and colludes with the Chinese Communists, lies under oath, censors people politically, and nothing!
[02:13:29.091 --> 02:13:32.332]  And nothing!
[02:13:32.332 --> 02:13:33.793]  I'm sick of this crap, man!
[02:13:33.793 --> 02:13:35.593]  Alright, I'm sorry for yelling, I promised I wouldn't.
[02:13:35.593 --> 02:13:37.393]  I'm sorry, I really am.
[02:13:37.393 --> 02:13:38.594]  Excuse me, let me take a deep breath.
[02:13:38.594 --> 02:13:39.514]  Andrew Torba is with us.
[02:13:41.133 --> 02:13:51.865]  And you just had Zach Voorhees report and he's since not necessarily redacted it but I think he's more on to something than he realizes.
[02:13:51.865 --> 02:13:58.073]  Google removing the custom search option where you can custom search by date.
[02:13:58.933 --> 02:13:59.193]  I don't know.
[02:14:13.968 --> 02:14:22.093]  You have to use the custom search bar to find certain things based on if date is the key one.
[02:14:22.093 --> 02:14:31.898]  Because so much propaganda just gets stacked up and stacked up and stacked up on a story, you have to go back in time and remove all of that fat to find the original content.
[02:14:31.898 --> 02:14:37.261]  So, of course Google would want to do that as kind of a time eraser.
[02:14:37.261 --> 02:14:42.644]  And I do predict if they haven't fully done that yet, I do think they will do that in the near future, Andrew.
[02:14:43.806 --> 02:14:44.526]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:14:44.526 --> 02:14:44.747]  Yeah.
[02:14:44.747 --> 02:14:51.790]  And again, this is one of the reasons why we're working so hard on improving our search results right now, specifically for this reason.
[02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:57.853]  So we want you to be able to go back in time, say of, you know, June of 2019 and search the word Trump.
[02:14:57.853 --> 02:15:02.476]  What was being talked about with that specific keyword at that specific point in time?
[02:15:02.896 --> 02:15:16.322]  For research purposes it is, it's crucial and what they want to do is they want to bury the past and they want to rewrite it and they want to force their narratives about what happened and how it happened and when it happened and why it happened.
[02:15:16.322 --> 02:15:27.266]  So I wouldn't be surprised if they remove that either and that's why they're making it more and more difficult to find information from sources that aren't CNN, from sources that aren't MSNBC, from sources that aren't
[02:15:27.586 --> 02:15:30.208]  You know, communist-infested Wikipedia.
[02:15:30.208 --> 02:15:32.629]  This stuff is going to continue.
[02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:34.711]  Alex said it best 20 years ago, right?
[02:15:34.711 --> 02:15:35.831]  It's a war for your mind.
[02:15:35.831 --> 02:15:37.452]  It's an information war.
[02:15:37.452 --> 02:15:44.717]  And right now they're winning, but we could fight back just like we're doing at Gab, just like you guys are doing at Infowars.
[02:15:44.717 --> 02:15:49.160]  We have to refuse to give in and to submit to their will.
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:55.504]  And the only way we're going to do that is by building and by fighting back against these narratives and calling them out.
[02:15:56.124 --> 02:16:01.388]  Exposing this stuff so that people know what's going on because most people, you know, you and I are in this day to day.
[02:16:01.388 --> 02:16:06.172]  So we see this stuff going on constantly and we try to keep people informed on what's happening.
[02:16:06.172 --> 02:16:10.115]  But most normal people are going about their day and they don't know that this stuff's going on.
[02:16:10.115 --> 02:16:19.483]  And then they run a Google search and, you know, they just get fed this, this, uh, mush of, of propaganda and they don't realize why or how it happened because it really wasn't always like this.
[02:16:19.483 --> 02:16:24.407]  It just started getting this way really when Trump came along and started turning everything on its head.
[02:16:24.407 --> 02:16:24.547]  So.
[02:16:24.947 --> 02:16:25.948]  I think it's going to continue.
[02:16:25.948 --> 02:16:31.494]  But you know, there is hope and there is a way forward and a path forward.
[02:16:31.494 --> 02:16:36.139]  And that's by building and that's by calling these people out and doing something about it.
[02:16:36.139 --> 02:16:41.645]  You know, you mentioned nothing is going on, you know, from Congress, nothing is going on from the DOJ.
[02:16:42.345 --> 02:16:53.529]  There's a great article in the American Conservative the other day that basically highlighted the money flow and the people flow where people are going back and forth between Silicon Valley, D.C.
[02:16:53.529 --> 02:16:54.469]  and Beijing.
[02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:56.090]  So you have this Conservative Inc.
[02:16:56.090 --> 02:16:59.051]  to Big Tech pipeline is the name of the article.
[02:16:59.051 --> 02:17:02.272]  And it just outlines how all of these people from Conservative Inc.
[02:17:02.272 --> 02:17:09.575]  are working with Big Tech in certain ways, with lobbying, and then working with Beijing for companies like TikTok to defend the Chinese.
[02:17:10.716 --> 02:17:15.381]  We're talking about banning TikTok, which would be fantastic and a very smart idea.
[02:17:15.381 --> 02:17:16.202]  There's the article there.
[02:17:16.202 --> 02:17:16.963]  It's a great article.
[02:17:16.963 --> 02:17:18.625]  I recommend everybody check it out.
[02:17:18.625 --> 02:17:22.169]  And it basically highlights, you know, why is nothing being done?
[02:17:22.169 --> 02:17:24.472]  Why is Congress doing nothing about this?
[02:17:24.912 --> 02:17:27.034]  Why is the DOJ doing nothing about this?
[02:17:27.034 --> 02:17:28.815]  Well, it comes down to money.
[02:17:28.815 --> 02:17:30.897]  It comes down to money.
[02:17:30.897 --> 02:17:37.021]  They're funneling people and they're funneling money back and forth between D.C., between Silicon Valley, and between Beijing.
[02:17:37.021 --> 02:17:44.227]  So, until something is done about that, I don't think this is going to stop, and I don't think we're going to see any action out of Congress or any action out of the DOJ.
[02:17:44.907 --> 02:17:49.551]  And anything that we do see is really just kabuki theater.
[02:17:49.551 --> 02:17:50.551]  Nothing's really going to happen.
[02:17:50.551 --> 02:17:52.913]  We see these antitrust investigations and all this.
[02:17:52.913 --> 02:17:59.638]  And maybe Google will get a slap on the wrist, maybe a nice big fine, but it's not going to stop them from doing what they're doing.
[02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:06.243]  So until the money flow stops, I don't think anything's really going to change on the government side of this.
[02:18:06.243 --> 02:18:10.827]  But in the free market, people like us and people like you are doing something about it by just
[02:18:11.327 --> 02:18:15.390]  Being an alternative voice and speaking some sanity to the madness.
[02:18:15.390 --> 02:18:19.192]  Yeah, and I mean, look, I'm not gonna... I guess I'll do a little teaser.
[02:18:19.192 --> 02:18:28.978]  I mean, I'm looking on starting up a new project, too, and just, like, not even doing savings anymore, just, like, hitting the gas, doubling down, like, we need as many battleships in this war as possible.
[02:18:28.978 --> 02:18:29.918]  But I'll just stop right there.
[02:18:29.918 --> 02:18:39.144]  You know, but it's actually worse than that, Andrew, because I remember... This had to be back in March or April, and I was reading a story, it was similar to that, but...
[02:18:40.185 --> 02:18:51.573]  It was about how in January, and you're aware of this, you just covered it, it was in the article, Apple and Google and Nike and some of these other companies, but Apple was the worst.
[02:18:51.573 --> 02:18:56.197]  I think it was like Apple sends like 57 people a day to and from China.
[02:18:56.197 --> 02:18:58.959]  And then it was like Google has a little less and then Nike only had a couple.
[02:18:58.959 --> 02:19:08.986]  But the point is, these corporations that really work out of China, they just operate under the American flag, but really it's the Chinese flag that's controlling them.
[02:19:10.347 --> 02:19:16.813]  They stopped those executive flights in January.
[02:19:16.813 --> 02:19:17.934]  Now, why am I telling you this?
[02:19:17.934 --> 02:19:19.195]  Why is this significant?
[02:19:19.195 --> 02:19:22.539]  Folks, they knew about the COVID hoax coming!
[02:19:22.539 --> 02:19:23.159]  They knew!
[02:19:23.159 --> 02:19:24.661]  They knew at Apple!
[02:19:24.661 --> 02:19:25.722]  They knew at Google!
[02:19:25.722 --> 02:19:26.923]  They knew at Nike!
[02:19:26.923 --> 02:19:29.045]  Why did they stop their flights?
[02:19:29.045 --> 02:19:32.928]  Why did they stop sending their executives before it all even came out?
[02:19:34.128 --> 02:19:35.833]  That needs to be investigated!
[02:19:35.833 --> 02:19:40.424]  I mean, so it's just, I mean, it's just a crime on top of crime on top of crime!
[02:19:42.225 --> 02:19:43.786]  I think you nailed it, right?
[02:19:43.786 --> 02:19:49.449]  These are foreign entities that are operating as American corporations.
[02:19:49.449 --> 02:19:53.031]  Now, they may be American on paper, right?
[02:19:53.031 --> 02:20:00.516]  They may be a C-corp in the United States of America, but they are more or less controlled by the Communist Chinese.
[02:20:00.516 --> 02:20:05.259]  You look at Reddit, which just accepted hundreds of millions of dollars in investment dollars from Tencent.
[02:20:05.259 --> 02:20:07.920]  You know, these companies... Oh yeah, and then what happened?
[02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:08.941]  The Donald gets banned?
[02:20:10.219 --> 02:20:11.821]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[02:20:11.821 --> 02:20:16.365]  I mean, it's the same thing that we're seeing with Twitter, you know, banning quote-unquote QAnons.
[02:20:16.365 --> 02:20:20.308]  You know, it's gaslighting to ban patriots and to ban supporters of the president.
[02:20:20.308 --> 02:20:20.929]  That's all it is.
[02:20:20.929 --> 02:20:22.811]  Here's what I'm going to do when we come back.
[02:20:23.646 --> 02:20:31.475]  This is so great, this conversation with Andrew Torba, and it just hit an electricity memory in my head.
[02:20:31.475 --> 02:20:35.880]  Folks, I'm going to break it all down, what this really is when we come back.
[02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:39.564]  But you know all these leftists and liberals complaining about slave owners?
[02:20:39.564 --> 02:20:40.785]  I got news for you.
[02:20:40.785 --> 02:20:43.388]  The modern day slave owners are at Apple and Nike.
[02:20:43.388 --> 02:20:44.790]  I'm going to break this down when we get back.
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:50.464]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:20:50.464 --> 02:20:59.370]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[02:20:59.370 --> 02:21:04.714]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:21:42.708 --> 02:21:43.068]  We're good to go.
[02:22:00.538 --> 02:22:00.958]  I think so.
[02:22:25.211 --> 02:22:27.793]  Well, I gotta tell you, normally we probably sold a couple hundred a month.
[02:22:27.793 --> 02:22:31.356]  We're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day.
[02:22:31.356 --> 02:22:33.498]  Plus, we have a good unit and it's also a good price.
[02:22:33.498 --> 02:22:35.079]  We have it in four different colors.
[02:22:35.079 --> 02:22:38.222]  It's the Privacy Pockets at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:22:38.222 --> 02:22:39.523]  People are really waking up.
[02:22:39.523 --> 02:22:43.486]  I'm seeing it all over the news that folks are aware of this and are now using these.
[02:22:43.486 --> 02:22:45.668]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:22:45.668 --> 02:22:50.412]  Oh, that under the mega-opulist technocracy plan, things are going to be so incredibly
[02:22:51.064 --> 02:22:51.765]  Fair.
[02:22:51.765 --> 02:22:52.265]  Wonderful.
[02:22:52.265 --> 02:23:01.073]  Because an all-seeing, all-loving computer that doesn't discriminate is going to decide who gets what resources, who gets what jobs.
[02:23:01.073 --> 02:23:14.746]  But in reality, it's building a post-human world so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged, distracted, atomized, and then slowly killed.
[02:23:14.746 --> 02:23:16.828]  This is the brave new world.
[02:23:17.566 --> 02:23:19.167]  It's the post-human world.
[02:23:19.167 --> 02:23:26.212]  It's the dreaming of the post-human world that Wired Magazine and the Wall Street Journal all tell us about.
[02:23:26.212 --> 02:23:29.395]  Oh, now they tell us our smartphones don't just track our every move.
[02:23:29.395 --> 02:23:34.999]  They're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[02:23:34.999 --> 02:23:44.706]  You see, the bear trap closed on our lead now, and the vampire walked out of the bushes and is explaining to us how he's slowly gonna bleed us and destroy us.
[02:23:48.863 --> 02:24:04.454]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:24:04.454 --> 02:24:08.336]  You know, the crew here is just so spectacular.
[02:24:08.336 --> 02:24:08.716]  I mean, they're...
[02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:19.775]  I've met with an impossible task every day, which is trying to be as quick on the computer as my mind is, and most of the time they have success.
[02:24:19.775 --> 02:24:23.457]  Now I've pretty much put an impossible task in front of them.
[02:24:23.457 --> 02:24:33.182]  There was an old article written, and I forget the author's name, and it talked about the truth of the Civil War, aside from the fake news at the time.
[02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:40.182]  Coverage of it, making up things, oh, it's not about slavery, oh, it's not about this, oh, Robert E. Lee is this or that.
[02:24:40.182 --> 02:24:49.548]  And in a very succinct two-page story, he kind of lays it out all truthfully about why Robert E. Lee joined the Confederacy and why the Civil War was really fought.
[02:24:49.548 --> 02:24:55.332]  And how really, say what you want about Robert E. Lee, that may be it, guys.
[02:24:55.332 --> 02:24:56.913]  Who's the article writer there?
[02:24:56.913 --> 02:24:58.935]  Do you know?
[02:24:58.935 --> 02:25:00.636]  Or that's probably not even it, actually.
[02:25:00.636 --> 02:25:01.937]  That's from an official museum.
[02:25:03.749 --> 02:25:07.924]  The point is, the author of the article points out...
[02:25:08.871 --> 02:25:14.794]  How all this spin about the Civil War and why Lincoln was in it or all of this stuff, it's all BS.
[02:25:14.794 --> 02:25:16.936]  It was all about slavery at the end of the day.
[02:25:16.936 --> 02:25:26.021]  Yes, there were side issues, but really it was Democrats in the South didn't want you to take their property, their slaves.
[02:25:26.021 --> 02:25:29.463]  That's really what it came down to, folks.
[02:25:29.463 --> 02:25:31.604]  And it's highlighted so perfectly in this article.
[02:25:31.604 --> 02:25:32.985]  I wish I could remember who wrote it.
[02:25:32.985 --> 02:25:34.325]  It's okay if you don't find it, guys.
[02:25:34.325 --> 02:25:35.146]  But my point is this.
[02:25:36.843 --> 02:25:47.466]  Just like the Civil War was about Democrats not wanting to give up their slaves then, it's the exact same thing today.
[02:25:47.466 --> 02:25:53.488]  Now, it's not really fair to say it's the Democrats versus the Republicans.
[02:25:53.488 --> 02:26:02.830]  It's really more about large corporations and they just happen to donate to the Democrats because the Democrats are the ones colluding with China more so than the Republicans.
[02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:05.131]  But just like
[02:26:06.283 --> 02:26:12.731]  It was Democrats in the South that fought to keep their slaves in the Civil War.
[02:26:12.731 --> 02:26:14.774]  That's exactly what's going on now, folks.
[02:26:14.774 --> 02:26:15.555]  It's just different.
[02:26:15.555 --> 02:26:17.998]  Here's what it is.
[02:26:17.998 --> 02:26:22.984]  All these major corporations have slave labor in China.
[02:26:22.984 --> 02:26:24.926]  Period.
[02:26:24.926 --> 02:26:25.247]  Period.
[02:26:26.909 --> 02:26:36.718]  Now Republicans have gone along with this too, but as far as the political workings are concerned, it's all being orchestrated by the Democrat Party.
[02:26:36.718 --> 02:26:38.019]  They're the ones voting for it.
[02:26:38.019 --> 02:26:39.480]  They're the ones fighting for it.
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:46.486]  So just like Democrats went to war with America to keep their slaves during the Civil War, they're doing it again.
[02:26:46.486 --> 02:26:49.489]  The only difference is their slaves are in China.
[02:26:50.748 --> 02:27:02.717]  So Apple and Nike and Google and all these huge corporations worth trillions of dollars, they know they have slave labor in China that keeps them rich.
[02:27:03.956 --> 02:27:10.520]  They know that Trump is trying to stop this from happening and going worldwide.
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:19.605]  So that's why all of these people are lined up against Trump like they were against Lincoln in the Civil War with the fake news and the Democrats.
[02:27:19.605 --> 02:27:21.366]  Because Lincoln said these are free men.
[02:27:23.837 --> 02:27:26.079]  You don't get to own slaves!
[02:27:26.079 --> 02:27:28.701]  And then, again, there was all kinds of things stacked on top of it.
[02:27:28.701 --> 02:27:29.482]  Oh, it's for the union.
[02:27:29.482 --> 02:27:30.003]  Oh, it's for this.
[02:27:30.003 --> 02:27:31.043]  Folks, let's be real.
[02:27:31.043 --> 02:27:32.725]  It was really mostly about slavery.
[02:27:32.725 --> 02:27:34.647]  It's the same thing today.
[02:27:34.647 --> 02:27:36.508]  It's the same thing today.
[02:27:36.508 --> 02:27:38.690]  Apple wants their Chinese slaves.
[02:27:38.690 --> 02:27:40.912]  Nike wants their Chinese slaves.
[02:27:40.912 --> 02:27:43.114]  Google wants their Chinese slaves.
[02:27:43.114 --> 02:27:46.597]  And they want that 3 billion herd of cattle
[02:27:47.948 --> 02:27:52.492]  As a money block to continue to get more rich and powerful.
[02:27:52.492 --> 02:27:53.913]  So that's what it is, folks.
[02:27:53.913 --> 02:27:55.975]  That's what this comes down to.
[02:27:55.975 --> 02:28:00.879]  At the end of the day, they all want their Chinese slaves.
[02:28:00.879 --> 02:28:05.543]  And that's why they're fighting like hell against America to keep their slaves.
[02:28:05.543 --> 02:28:13.770]  So just like Democrats in the Civil War fought to keep their slaves, the globalists are fighting to keep their slaves in China right now.
[02:28:13.770 --> 02:28:15.132]  Andrew Torba from Gab.
[02:28:16.141 --> 02:28:17.963]  With me from one more segment.
[02:28:17.963 --> 02:28:21.707]  Would you like to respond to that, Andrew, or make any final statements here?
[02:28:21.707 --> 02:28:23.509]  Yeah, and I think it's actually twofold, right?
[02:28:23.509 --> 02:28:34.540]  So they have actual slaves in China, like real people that are slaving away for next to nothing, and in some cases nothing, which is why these trillion dollar companies exist in the first place.
[02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:36.962]  But then we're also slaves, right?
[02:28:36.962 --> 02:28:38.144]  We're also their slaves.
[02:28:38.144 --> 02:28:39.265]  We're their data slaves.
[02:28:40.005 --> 02:28:43.347]  You know all of us that are using these big tech products.
[02:28:43.347 --> 02:28:44.568]  We are their products.
[02:28:44.568 --> 02:28:46.549]  We are giving them the information.
[02:28:46.549 --> 02:28:48.910]  We are making them billions of dollars.
[02:28:48.910 --> 02:28:55.334]  So you know that's how we can control the situation one person at a time here is by waking up to that fact.
[02:28:55.794 --> 02:28:58.937]  The fact is that they are data mining all of us.
[02:28:58.937 --> 02:29:02.299]  We are their mind slaves as long as we continue to use these products.
[02:29:02.299 --> 02:29:05.762]  And that's one of the reasons why I deleted Gab's Twitter account.
[02:29:05.762 --> 02:29:07.964]  We weren't banned or people thought we were banned.
[02:29:07.964 --> 02:29:11.627]  I deleted it personally because I didn't want to be a part of that matrix anymore.
[02:29:11.627 --> 02:29:15.310]  I didn't want my mind to be enslaved to Twitter's system anymore.
[02:29:15.310 --> 02:29:16.811]  So I opted out of that system.
[02:29:16.811 --> 02:29:19.393]  And that's why I'm only exclusively on Gab right now.
[02:29:19.393 --> 02:29:22.015]  So I think, you know, it's twofold, right?
[02:29:22.015 --> 02:29:22.556]  Again, we have
[02:29:22.896 --> 02:29:26.158]  No, no, but let's hone in on that because some people might not understand this.
[02:29:38.525 --> 02:29:43.229]  The data that we're giving them is what they use to make money in marketing.
[02:29:43.229 --> 02:29:45.171]  And they say, oh, here's what people are looking at.
[02:29:45.171 --> 02:29:46.353]  Here's what people are interested in.
[02:29:46.353 --> 02:29:47.654]  Here's where people are traveling.
[02:29:47.654 --> 02:29:52.099]  And then they sell that data to these marketing research firms.
[02:29:52.099 --> 02:29:55.202]  So I just kind of want to crystallize that for people to understand.
[02:29:55.202 --> 02:29:59.026]  They take all this data and then they use it for marketing purposes and they make billions.
[02:30:00.066 --> 02:30:00.926]  Right, exactly.
[02:30:00.926 --> 02:30:10.749]  So, you know, as you're using Facebook, as you're using Twitter, as you're using Google, they are tracking every click, everything you search, everything you type, everything you say through your microphone, right?
[02:30:10.749 --> 02:30:13.589]  Your camera roll, everything is being tracked.
[02:30:13.589 --> 02:30:19.171]  That data is then being used and sold to advertisers and to marketers and to big data firms.
[02:30:19.571 --> 02:30:22.933]  Which is how Facebook and Twitter and Google make all of their money.
[02:30:22.933 --> 02:30:24.495]  So we are their product.
[02:30:24.495 --> 02:30:35.843]  Our information, what we're talking about, what we're sharing, all of these things go into this big data pool that they then turn around and sell access to and make billions of dollars on.
[02:30:35.843 --> 02:30:38.564]  So, you know, in a way, again, we are their slaves too.
[02:30:38.564 --> 02:30:40.966]  And the only way to stop that, we have control over it.
[02:30:40.966 --> 02:30:41.446]  That's the thing.
[02:30:41.446 --> 02:30:42.968]  We have control over it.
[02:30:42.968 --> 02:30:49.032]  There's a Pew study that came out saying 72% of Americans believe that social media companies hold too much power in politics.
[02:30:49.432 --> 02:30:54.077]  Well, 72% of people understand this and most people understand that they're being tracked.
[02:30:54.077 --> 02:30:56.700]  Most people understand that they are the product being sold.
[02:30:56.700 --> 02:30:59.624]  Why do we continue to use these products?
[02:30:59.624 --> 02:31:00.985]  That's the big question here.
[02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:06.051]  Why do we continue to allow ourselves to be enslaved to these companies and to make these companies billions of dollars?
[02:31:06.411 --> 02:31:25.303]  Which they then turn around and use against us and use against our country and use against, you know, our freedoms to destroy them and annihilate them and further enslave us, not just enslave our minds, but now enslave our bodies and enslave us as people in this country when they take over completely, which is what we don't want to see happen.
[02:31:25.303 --> 02:31:33.389]  So the first step in preventing that from happening is to opt out of their matrix and to stop being mind slaves to these people and to stop making them money.
[02:31:33.809 --> 02:31:44.776]  And you know, here's the thing about Kanye West is he takes really deep intellectual thoughts from his mind and then just lays it out in a phrase and so people can't get it.
[02:31:44.776 --> 02:31:51.041]  And maybe he just doesn't want to fully explain it or he can't put into words, but when he said slavery is a choice, this is exactly what he's talking about.
[02:31:51.752 --> 02:31:54.874]  But to answer the question, you know, why do Americans do it?
[02:31:54.874 --> 02:31:56.494]  Well, it's so trendy.
[02:31:56.494 --> 02:31:57.655]  It's so trendy, right?
[02:31:57.655 --> 02:31:59.396]  I mean, the elites have been saying it forever.
[02:31:59.396 --> 02:32:02.818]  We will make Americans want to be slaves.
[02:32:02.818 --> 02:32:04.278]  Oh, I have to be on the Twitter.
[02:32:04.278 --> 02:32:05.119]  I have to be on this.
[02:32:05.119 --> 02:32:06.520]  I have to get that dopamine hit.
[02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:09.121]  So it's been designed.
[02:32:09.121 --> 02:32:14.524]  And the Facebook, one of the creators came out and said, yeah, we designed it to make it addictive so that you need it.
[02:32:14.524 --> 02:32:16.705]  And then you are desperate to be our slave.
[02:32:17.932 --> 02:32:18.312]  Right.
[02:32:18.312 --> 02:32:18.833]  Exactly.
[02:32:18.833 --> 02:32:24.237]  But what you'll find is that when you free yourself, you have less anxiety.
[02:32:24.237 --> 02:32:25.778]  You have less stress.
[02:32:25.778 --> 02:32:28.400]  You can focus more time on your family.
[02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:29.360]  I've been reading more.
[02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:30.481]  I've been writing more.
[02:32:30.481 --> 02:32:34.164]  I've been spending more time with my daughter and with my wife.
[02:32:34.164 --> 02:32:36.506]  These are the things that we should be doing with our time.
[02:32:36.506 --> 02:32:38.867]  And these are the things they don't want us doing with our time.
[02:32:38.867 --> 02:32:46.493]  They want us sitting there all day, you know, refreshing the feeds and checking our notifications and getting those dopamine hits and staying controlled.
[02:32:46.793 --> 02:32:55.520]  Because they feed us, they decide what information we're allowed to see and what we're not allowed to see and who's allowed to have a voice and who isn't.
[02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:56.701]  So that's where they want you.
[02:32:56.701 --> 02:33:04.907]  They want you in this little box on Twitter where they can control what information you have access to and who you're allowed to talk to and what you're allowed to say.
[02:33:04.907 --> 02:33:05.887]  That's where they want you.
[02:33:05.887 --> 02:33:13.253]  And when you break free from that mind prison and you come out into the real world or you go to other sites like Gab,
[02:33:13.553 --> 02:33:20.156]  Where you can speak freely without having to worry about these big tech tyrants deciding what you can say and what you can't.
[02:33:20.156 --> 02:33:28.780]  It's a whole new world and you're free to think and you're free to do other things that you didn't have the ability to do when you were stuck in that mind prison.
[02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:32.682]  Andrew Torba, dissenter.com, gab.com.
[02:33:32.682 --> 02:33:33.722]  Andrew, a pleasure as always.
[02:33:33.722 --> 02:33:36.203]  Thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:36.203 --> 02:33:36.844]  Thanks for having me.
[02:33:36.844 --> 02:33:41.486]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna have a news blitz and a couple phone calls when we come back.
[02:33:45.178 --> 02:33:53.376]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:33:54.659 --> 02:33:59.403]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:33:59.403 --> 02:34:01.745]  Super Male Vitality!
[02:34:01.745 --> 02:34:10.592]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[02:34:10.592 --> 02:34:21.461]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[02:34:21.741 --> 02:34:22.442]  Yes.
[02:34:22.442 --> 02:34:27.344]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[02:34:27.344 --> 02:34:34.268]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[02:34:34.268 --> 02:34:35.309]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:34:35.309 --> 02:34:37.170]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[02:34:37.170 --> 02:34:39.992]  Never been a better time than right now.
[02:34:39.992 --> 02:34:44.494]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:34:44.494 --> 02:34:45.395]  Another part of the greater
[02:34:48.507 --> 02:34:48.888]  We're good.
[02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:06.371]  Virgin Mary's are getting torn down.
[02:35:06.371 --> 02:35:08.411]  I mean, crosses are being torn down.
[02:35:08.411 --> 02:35:13.613]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real.
[02:35:13.613 --> 02:35:19.995]  It is spiritual, and it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface, and now it's emerged.
[02:35:20.495 --> 02:35:23.277]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[02:35:23.277 --> 02:35:24.358]  I'm praying for America.
[02:35:24.358 --> 02:35:25.238]  I'm praying for you.
[02:35:25.238 --> 02:35:28.380]  And I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it.
[02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:31.382]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening.
[02:35:31.382 --> 02:35:33.784]  Pray for Donald Trump to be protected.
[02:35:33.784 --> 02:35:41.348]  Pray for him to win in a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalists to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[02:35:41.348 --> 02:35:42.029]  God bless you all.
[02:35:42.029 --> 02:35:43.210]  Please pray for him for us as well.
[02:35:43.210 --> 02:35:48.173]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask.
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:50.521]  At InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:35:50.521 --> 02:35:52.141]  You can wear them out to political events.
[02:35:52.141 --> 02:35:53.842]  You can trigger lib darts.
[02:35:53.842 --> 02:36:00.985]  One of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[02:36:00.985 --> 02:36:07.248]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[02:36:07.248 --> 02:36:12.830]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing of their openly
[02:36:13.351 --> 02:36:13.772]  I don't know.
[02:36:24.406 --> 02:36:28.807]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[02:36:28.807 --> 02:36:32.609]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[02:36:32.609 --> 02:36:34.689]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[02:36:34.689 --> 02:36:36.190]  They don't protect from it.
[02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:39.130]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks' faces.
[02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:41.791]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[02:36:41.791 --> 02:36:42.792]  They're at cost.
[02:36:42.792 --> 02:36:44.152]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:45.302 --> 02:36:46.843]  The people are awakening.
[02:36:46.843 --> 02:36:49.546]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[02:36:49.546 --> 02:36:51.628]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[02:36:51.628 --> 02:36:53.970]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[02:36:53.970 --> 02:37:03.339]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[02:37:03.619 --> 02:37:12.205]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[02:37:12.205 --> 02:37:18.910]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[02:37:18.910 --> 02:37:20.351]  In their own words, they admit it.
[02:37:20.351 --> 02:37:24.774]  Show, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[02:37:25.254 --> 02:37:27.195]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[02:37:27.195 --> 02:37:28.276]  They're Faraday cages.
[02:37:28.276 --> 02:37:29.936]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[02:37:29.936 --> 02:37:31.957]  They work absolutely great.
[02:37:31.957 --> 02:37:41.102]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[02:37:41.102 --> 02:37:48.305]  Get yours at InfoWarscore.com today.
[02:37:48.305 --> 02:37:50.927]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:01.559 --> 02:38:06.321]  Okay, final segment for me here.
[02:38:06.321 --> 02:38:09.642]  Bishop Larry Gators is going to be taking over.
[02:38:09.642 --> 02:38:14.103]  Is he going to be taking over right at two guys?
[02:38:14.103 --> 02:38:15.364]  Absolutely.
[02:38:15.364 --> 02:38:18.485]  So, he's going to be breaking down a lot of the cultural stuff developing.
[02:38:19.908 --> 02:38:22.890]  People really loved the segment he had on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:22.890 --> 02:38:24.530]  Was it a week or so?
[02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:26.151]  So we brought him back for the fourth hour.
[02:38:26.151 --> 02:38:28.292]  It's going to be can't miss.
[02:38:28.292 --> 02:38:30.453]  Harrison Smith filling in for me on the War Room.
[02:38:30.453 --> 02:38:37.256]  I'm going to probably pop in on the first segment or two just to make a couple statements.
[02:38:37.256 --> 02:38:41.078]  Let me just hit some of this news, folks, before we go to the calls.
[02:38:41.078 --> 02:38:43.419]  If you're not on the line yet, just don't bother calling.
[02:38:43.419 --> 02:38:45.160]  We've got three callers, guys.
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:46.480]  We'll get to those three and that'll be it.
[02:38:49.295 --> 02:38:52.618]  Look at how big of a joke this is.
[02:38:52.618 --> 02:39:02.886]  And, you know, I like to get along with people and I tend to forget that most people are weaklings and weak-minded and weak foundations.
[02:39:02.886 --> 02:39:05.929]  But, I'm sorry, I just have to call it like it is.
[02:39:05.929 --> 02:39:09.872]  And, boy, Brad Parscale is really an embarrassment.
[02:39:09.872 --> 02:39:12.134]  I mean, this guy, this is sad, Brad.
[02:39:13.154 --> 02:39:15.075]  He puts this tweet up today.
[02:39:15.075 --> 02:39:16.616]  I talked to a police officer today.
[02:39:16.616 --> 02:39:18.798]  He said a child was shot and killed in Florida.
[02:39:18.798 --> 02:39:20.979]  The child had COVID.
[02:39:20.979 --> 02:39:23.801]  After blood testing, he was marked as a COVID death.
[02:39:23.801 --> 02:39:26.823]  If this is true, this madness must stop.
[02:39:26.823 --> 02:39:28.184]  Brad!
[02:39:28.184 --> 02:39:29.825]  Paging Brad!
[02:39:29.825 --> 02:39:31.686]  Earth to Brad!
[02:39:31.686 --> 02:39:35.228]  This has been going on for months, bro!
[02:39:35.228 --> 02:39:42.253]  And the news organization you claim to have never heard of, InfoWars, has been breaking this and fighting this for months.
[02:39:44.025 --> 02:39:48.146]  Now you know why you got fired as campaign manager.
[02:39:48.146 --> 02:39:49.286]  Should have happened months ago.
[02:39:49.286 --> 02:39:55.808]  I mean, seriously, dude, you don't know who InfoWars is and you're the head of social media management for the Trump campaign?
[02:39:55.808 --> 02:40:00.088]  You're the campaign advisor and you don't know they've been faking COVID deaths for months?
[02:40:00.088 --> 02:40:03.809]  Dude, what are you doing?
[02:40:03.809 --> 02:40:05.950]  What are you doing?
[02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:06.830]  But let's move on.
[02:40:08.522 --> 02:40:14.565]  Andrew Cuomo, you know, you've never met a bigger criminal ever, I think, in a governor's role.
[02:40:14.565 --> 02:40:17.206]  The mass murder that he's guilty of.
[02:40:17.206 --> 02:40:18.567]  The total fraud.
[02:40:18.567 --> 02:40:20.908]  He says today there should be a national mask mandate.
[02:40:20.908 --> 02:40:22.629]  Hey, jerk!
[02:40:22.629 --> 02:40:26.070]  You were just in Georgia, not wearing a mask!
[02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:27.691]  I'm gonna stop before I start screaming.
[02:40:27.691 --> 02:40:32.753]  Andrew Cuomo belongs behind bars for the rest of his life.
[02:40:32.753 --> 02:40:34.874]  Okay?
[02:40:34.874 --> 02:40:36.435]  That's just for the murders that he committed.
[02:40:37.659 --> 02:40:40.481]  Who knows what kind of stuff he's involved in with these sex cults.
[02:40:40.481 --> 02:40:42.603]  You know Cuomo's in the Knicks of them cult.
[02:40:42.603 --> 02:40:46.806]  You know he's probably parading around with Epstein gals with his little nipple rings.
[02:40:46.806 --> 02:40:50.889]  Probably puts that, you know, fake cotton tip with his brother up his own butt.
[02:40:50.889 --> 02:40:51.369]  Excuse me.
[02:40:51.369 --> 02:40:54.171]  That's just, you know, that's the kind of guy he is.
[02:40:54.171 --> 02:40:55.512]  Sorry.
[02:40:55.512 --> 02:40:55.992]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:55.992 --> 02:40:59.235]  It's just, this is what these people are, folks.
[02:40:59.235 --> 02:41:00.295]  Now check this out.
[02:41:00.295 --> 02:41:01.496]  Again, InfoWars.
[02:41:01.496 --> 02:41:03.978]  Next month's news today.
[02:41:03.978 --> 02:41:04.298]  From the
[02:41:05.953 --> 02:41:13.860]  Minneapolis star fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and wife charged with tax crimes.
[02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:16.722]  So folks, we told you this guy was a crooked cop.
[02:41:16.722 --> 02:41:18.584]  He was involved with shady stuff.
[02:41:18.584 --> 02:41:20.425]  He was already involved with Floyd.
[02:41:20.425 --> 02:41:24.068]  Who knows what else was going on if he was dealing drugs or taking cuts.
[02:41:24.068 --> 02:41:26.771]  He got caught with all this money not paying taxes.
[02:41:26.771 --> 02:41:30.033]  Folks, he was a dirty cop!
[02:41:30.033 --> 02:41:31.274]  He knew Floyd!
[02:41:31.274 --> 02:41:33.917]  There's something else going on here entirely!
[02:41:34.994 --> 02:41:37.576]  But forget about that, it's no big deal.
[02:41:37.576 --> 02:41:44.921]  Two Italian teens arrested for paying Bitcoin to live stream torture and murder of children on dark web.
[02:41:44.921 --> 02:41:46.462]  Wow.
[02:41:46.462 --> 02:41:49.084]  Joe Biden is being investigated for crimes in Ukraine.
[02:41:49.084 --> 02:41:52.427]  I know you know that, but you know, might as well just remind you.
[02:41:52.427 --> 02:41:59.152]  Joe Biden is now back on air talking about how he likes nurses breathing into his nostrils.
[02:41:59.152 --> 02:42:02.114]  Alan Dershowitz debates RFK on mandatory vaccines.
[02:42:03.183 --> 02:42:04.324]  List goes on and on.
[02:42:04.324 --> 02:42:09.066]  Remember that assault, that sexual assault that Libtard filed against Tucker Carlson?
[02:42:09.066 --> 02:42:09.866]  It's already busted.
[02:42:09.866 --> 02:42:11.267]  It's already completely fallen apart.
[02:42:11.267 --> 02:42:13.568]  I mean, you people are pathetic.
[02:42:13.568 --> 02:42:13.728]  St.
[02:42:13.728 --> 02:42:18.790]  Louis Prosecutor's Office busted altering evidence in the McCloskey case.
[02:42:18.790 --> 02:42:20.131]  They literally got busted.
[02:42:20.131 --> 02:42:24.353]  It turns out the pistol that the woman was carrying was unoperable and they knew it.
[02:42:24.353 --> 02:42:26.374]  And they literally went in.
[02:42:26.374 --> 02:42:28.275]  You know this is how OJ Simpson got off, right?
[02:42:30.097 --> 02:42:35.801]  Oh, but I doubt that the McCloskeys get that same treatment in court.
[02:42:35.801 --> 02:42:36.901]  Unbelievable, man.
[02:42:36.901 --> 02:42:40.083]  When are Americans going to say we are sick and tired of this?
[02:42:40.083 --> 02:42:40.464]  Hey, you know what?
[02:42:40.464 --> 02:42:46.007]  Some good news real quick before we come up, because we are humans, we are pioneers, we are adventurers.
[02:42:46.007 --> 02:42:50.570]  Scientists prepare for year-long expedition to study mysterious blue hole in Florida.
[02:42:50.570 --> 02:42:52.491]  Hey, that's kind of cool.
[02:42:52.491 --> 02:42:53.992]  We talk about space all day long.
[02:42:53.992 --> 02:42:56.654]  We haven't even seen 98% of the ocean yet.
[02:42:59.813 --> 02:43:01.414]  So I think that's kind of cool.
[02:43:01.414 --> 02:43:03.295]  Alright.
[02:43:03.295 --> 02:43:06.677]  Mandolin in Missouri.
[02:43:06.677 --> 02:43:08.959]  Go ahead.
[02:43:08.959 --> 02:43:14.142]  I would actually like to have a message to Donald Trump, if you don't mind.
[02:43:15.053 --> 02:43:23.379]  Um, you know, I've been trying to get a hold of our public health officials and they keep directing me to like all these other people.
[02:43:23.379 --> 02:43:26.000]  So I'm, I'm a mother of two children.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:27.221]  Okay.
[02:43:27.221 --> 02:43:34.226]  And when I saw these Black Lives Matter people, um, I don't know if you saw the picture of it, but it was a little white boy.
[02:43:34.226 --> 02:43:41.090]  And, and it said BLM now, and that really frustrated me.
[02:43:41.090 --> 02:43:43.432]  So I just want to reach out to Donald Trump.
[02:43:44.304 --> 02:43:47.247]  And he needs to get all of this under control.
[02:43:47.247 --> 02:43:50.269]  He is the President of the United States.
[02:43:50.269 --> 02:43:52.231]  I don't care what else he's doing.
[02:43:52.231 --> 02:43:58.617]  He needs to open up this economy before it goes down to the ground, because I'm hearing all this stuff about 5G.
[02:43:58.617 --> 02:44:02.540]  You got 5Gs on these water towers now.
[02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:05.663]  And it just, it blows my mind.
[02:44:05.663 --> 02:44:11.048]  And yes, I am very passionate about what I believe in, just like you and Alex Jones.
[02:44:11.676 --> 02:44:18.498]  And, you know, I listen to you guys every single day, and finally, you know, I'm coming on here and speaking my mind.
[02:44:18.498 --> 02:44:19.538]  I've had enough.
[02:44:19.538 --> 02:44:20.898]  Well, let me ask you this, Mandalyn.
[02:44:20.898 --> 02:44:22.239]  Let me ask you this, and I'll be fair.
[02:44:22.239 --> 02:44:24.239]  This wasn't originally my theory.
[02:44:24.239 --> 02:44:39.363]  Actually, it was Savage, Michael Savage, that theorized this a month or two ago, but it's completely played out, and I didn't intentionally plan to take this call from you today, but Michael Savage has been doing this on this radio show, that mothers and conservative mothers that voted Trump
[02:44:40.183 --> 02:44:41.423]  See, that's what it is.
[02:44:41.423 --> 02:44:42.844]  It's in the gut, isn't it?
[02:45:03.063 --> 02:45:10.793]  That our country and all these stupid people that are going around and terrorizing people, you know what?
[02:45:10.793 --> 02:45:11.814]  Somebody's gonna snap.
[02:45:12.498 --> 02:45:16.460]  I don't know if it's me, I don't know if it's you or Alex Jones, I just feel you guys.
[02:45:16.460 --> 02:45:23.183]  I am the same exact way, and I don't mean to yell and get all upset, it's just... No, I hear you, Mandlin.
[02:45:23.183 --> 02:45:26.645]  And here's the thing, it's not gonna be us that snaps, and I'm glad you said that.
[02:45:26.645 --> 02:45:34.469]  What it's gonna be is, it'll be like a James Hodgkinson who goes out and shoots up a Republican baseball practice
[02:45:35.149 --> 02:45:44.872]  Except it'll just be a psychopath who goes to one of these things with no political ideology, but just to go murder and cause chaos, and then they'll blame it on Trump.
[02:45:44.872 --> 02:45:46.172]  They'll blame it on it.
[02:45:46.172 --> 02:45:47.592]  They're setting it up, folks.
[02:45:47.592 --> 02:45:49.253]  They're setting us up.
[02:45:49.253 --> 02:45:56.715]  I mean, we're about to walk into a bear trap, but it's like the biggest bear trap ever, and it snaps you, and it cuts your legs off.
[02:45:56.715 --> 02:45:58.415]  So we better be aware of this, Mandlin.
[02:45:58.415 --> 02:46:01.636]  I know you are, and we are, but I mean, it's time for America to realize this.
[02:46:01.636 --> 02:46:02.216]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:02.216 --> 02:46:03.337]  Jeff in Canada.
[02:46:03.337 --> 02:46:04.017]  Jeff in Canada.
[02:46:04.017 --> 02:46:04.257]  Go ahead.
[02:46:06.909 --> 02:46:09.390]  Thanks for taking my call, Owen.
[02:46:09.390 --> 02:46:11.851]  For lack of vision, the people perish.
[02:46:11.851 --> 02:46:14.932]  And right now, Trump has not got a good vision.
[02:46:14.932 --> 02:46:20.314]  He's doing this vaccine kabuki, and it's really discouraging people.
[02:46:20.314 --> 02:46:27.236]  He will blow himself up if he gets behind the mandatory vaccine initiative.
[02:46:27.236 --> 02:46:32.158]  What Trump needs to do is a power move of setting up a therapeutic commission
[02:46:33.061 --> 02:46:39.127]  And pull all these doctors, even from America and around the world together, sit them down, and that... You know what, though?
[02:46:39.127 --> 02:46:42.610]  Let me just stop you right there, Jeff, because I just have to disagree with you.
[02:46:42.610 --> 02:46:45.152]  That's just playing into the COVID hoax further.
[02:46:45.152 --> 02:46:48.215]  He needs to just bring out a team that says it's a hoax!
[02:46:48.215 --> 02:46:48.916]  It's a hoax!
[02:46:48.916 --> 02:46:50.057]  That's what he needs to do!
[02:46:50.057 --> 02:46:53.420]  Bring out a team of doctors that say it's a hoax!
[02:46:53.420 --> 02:46:54.661]  And then show all the data!
[02:46:54.941 --> 02:46:56.522]  Show the numbers being rigged.
[02:46:56.522 --> 02:46:57.922]  Show the fake tests.
[02:46:57.922 --> 02:46:59.002]  Show the fake results.
[02:46:59.002 --> 02:47:00.243]  I mean, that's what this takes.
[02:47:00.243 --> 02:47:01.323]  I mean, here's what it is.
[02:47:01.323 --> 02:47:03.744]  You play with fire, you're going to get burned.
[02:47:03.744 --> 02:47:07.926]  And he's been playing with fire way too long.
[02:47:07.926 --> 02:47:14.628]  Right now, though, I think if he can, if he, if he would do something like that, it would, it would prick the bubble of fear.
[02:47:14.628 --> 02:47:17.849]  It would pop the mask bubble and it would support the economy.
[02:47:17.849 --> 02:47:20.950]  I think the whole kabuki is to try and support the economy.
[02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:22.971]  But here's to my second point, what Trump needs to do.
[02:47:23.484 --> 02:47:25.666]  Not these teller rallies that he was doing.
[02:47:25.666 --> 02:47:31.910]  His rallies have been squashed and he wants to hold a bully pulpit right now, but he can't do that because of the COVID.
[02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:37.134]  What he needs to do is have a White House barbecue once a week or twice a week.
[02:47:37.134 --> 02:47:39.436]  Invite the prop, you know.
[02:47:39.436 --> 02:47:40.937]  But see, but Jeff, you just said it again.
[02:47:40.937 --> 02:47:42.839]  He can't do something because of the COVID.
[02:47:42.839 --> 02:47:43.179]  Why?
[02:47:43.179 --> 02:47:43.819]  Why?
[02:47:43.819 --> 02:47:48.443]  Why are we allowing COVID to dictate our lives?
[02:47:50.245 --> 02:47:52.926]  I agree, but he's stuck in a bind right now.
[02:47:52.926 --> 02:47:54.847]  I think this is his way out.
[02:47:54.847 --> 02:47:57.768]  He could do... Jeff, I wish I had more time.
[02:47:57.768 --> 02:47:58.108]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:58.108 --> 02:48:01.829]  We got 30 seconds, Jeff, and I gotta let you go, but call back in tomorrow if we take calls.
[02:48:01.829 --> 02:48:03.349]  I really do apologize, Jeff.
[02:48:03.349 --> 02:48:04.290]  It's just, it's the same thing.
[02:48:04.290 --> 02:48:10.812]  Like, I see people saying, oh, well, Trump's wearing the mask now so that you can say you can go vote because you can wear a mask.
[02:48:10.812 --> 02:48:11.472]  Why?
[02:48:11.472 --> 02:48:13.813]  Why are we playing games with these people?
[02:48:13.813 --> 02:48:15.693]  Why are we swallowing fire?
[02:48:15.693 --> 02:48:16.894]  This is ridiculous!
[02:48:17.774 --> 02:48:19.175]  Alright folks, I'm signing off.
[02:48:19.175 --> 02:48:20.596]  Bishop Larry Gators takes over.
[02:48:20.596 --> 02:48:23.817]  I'm going to make a brief statement on the War Room in an hour.
[02:48:23.817 --> 02:48:24.898]  Thanks everybody for tuning in.
[02:48:24.898 --> 02:48:26.119]  You stay classy, InfoWars.
[02:48:26.119 --> 02:48:30.001]  Remember, Christmas and July sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:48:30.001 --> 02:48:32.102]  Free shipping, store wide.
[02:48:34.378 --> 02:48:45.186]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[02:48:45.186 --> 02:48:54.413]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[02:48:54.773 --> 02:49:08.941]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[02:49:08.941 --> 02:49:23.150]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:25.291]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[02:49:25.291 --> 02:49:31.974]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[02:49:31.974 --> 02:49:33.735]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[02:49:36.229 --> 02:49:38.270]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:49:38.270 --> 02:49:59.162]  A consortium of the UNWHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and of course, the Clinton Global Initiative, headed up by Chelsea Clinton on the board, are in control of Apple and Google with a hidden app on all phones that you cannot turn off to track and trace everywhere you go.
[02:49:59.162 --> 02:50:03.665]  They claim for COVID, but of course, it's really the Chinese communist social score rollout.
[02:50:04.045 --> 02:50:11.949]  These people are sick, filthy criminals, and they want total control over society with the official global ID system.
[02:50:11.949 --> 02:50:14.610]  That's why it's called the Clinton Global Initiative.
[02:50:14.610 --> 02:50:19.173]  But you can fight back with the privacy pockets at infowarestore.com.
[02:50:19.173 --> 02:50:29.558]  Little Faraday cages, little envelopes, put your phone in it, and these dirty, scumbag, fascist pieces of garbage can't get all that data and rape you with that data.
[02:50:29.858 --> 02:50:30.820]  Rape your privacy.
[02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:38.330]  Tell the rapist Clintons go to hell and get your privacy pockets in a Fort Worth store.
[02:50:38.330 --> 02:50:40.933]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:59.645 --> 02:51:03.448]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:03.448 --> 02:51:06.130]  I am your guest host here this afternoon.
[02:51:06.130 --> 02:51:07.751]  My name is Bishop Larry Gators.
[02:51:07.751 --> 02:51:16.518]  I am the host of the nationally and internationally syndicated radio show, Global Spiritual Revolution Radio through the Life Radio Network.
[02:51:17.158 --> 02:51:20.821]  92.9 FM, 1460 AM on your dial.
[02:51:20.821 --> 02:51:29.627]  We're also internationally syndicated through the iHeart Radio Network in the iHeart Media Group, also here in New York City.
[02:51:29.627 --> 02:51:35.591]  We are so excited and so very honored to be back with you guys for this fourth
[02:51:37.913 --> 02:51:41.155]  This fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:41.155 --> 02:51:50.623]  And just I want to give you guys kind of a preview of a coming attraction that we're going to be talking about for the next 15-20 minutes.
[02:51:50.623 --> 02:52:03.933]  The theme that I really want us to get into this afternoon is the title Kanye West, Harriet Tubman and the Prince Hall Paradigm.
[02:52:04.807 --> 02:52:11.953]  Again, Kanye West on Harriet Tubman in the Prince Hall Paradigm.
[02:52:11.953 --> 02:52:25.845]  Now, I'm going to say something quickly here as we're laying the schematical foundation, what we're going to be talking about in the next segment concerning Kanye West, Harriet Tubman in the Prince Hall Paradigm.
[02:52:25.845 --> 02:52:30.709]  What the Bishop is going to reveal to you right now.
[02:52:30.709 --> 02:52:33.151]  Kanye West told the truth.
[02:52:34.361 --> 02:52:36.223]  I know this is mind-blowing.
[02:52:36.223 --> 02:52:40.286]  I know that a lot of you think Kanye West has lost his mind.
[02:52:40.286 --> 02:52:47.792]  Kanye West and people like him, like Dave Chappelle, have not lost their minds.
[02:52:47.792 --> 02:52:54.517]  It was not by accident, okay, that Kanye West said what he said a few days ago.
[02:52:54.517 --> 02:52:56.459]  Where?
[02:52:56.459 --> 02:52:59.161]  In North Charleston, South Carolina.
[02:52:59.983 --> 02:53:05.446]  Which is the exact geolocation, okay?
[02:53:05.446 --> 02:53:28.761]  The location, going back to June of 1863, where Harriet Tubman, okay, who is proclaimed as the Moses of that generation, Harriet Tubman was recruited by the Rothschilds through the Northern Military Industrial Complex
[02:53:30.066 --> 02:53:59.055]  To deliver Black people out of slavery, not because the North loved Black people, but through Rothschild money, through Albert Pike, through Levi Coffin, okay, through John Brown, the Rothschilds needed a woman or a man that could lead slaves out of from the South for what?
[02:54:00.393 --> 02:54:11.515]  In other words, she was instructed to free the slaves anywhere from 70 to 300, and most of these slaves were engineers.
[02:54:11.515 --> 02:54:15.416]  I know this is mind-blowing, and a lot of this information that you never heard before.
[02:54:15.416 --> 02:54:18.297]  A lot of the slaves were engineers.
[02:54:18.297 --> 02:54:20.477]  They were land surveyors.
[02:54:20.477 --> 02:54:22.258]  They were craftsmen.
[02:54:22.258 --> 02:54:24.038]  They were brick masons.
[02:54:24.882 --> 02:54:26.803]  We're good to go.
[02:54:51.130 --> 02:55:04.603]  Industrial complex through their military arm in their financial arm that they needed black engineers and surveyors to prepare for the oncoming onslaught.
[02:55:05.425 --> 02:55:13.887]  Of the Civil War that started on the 12th of April 1861 and ended on the 9th of April in 1865.
[02:55:13.887 --> 02:55:18.089]  So we're going to go into a quick break.
[02:55:18.089 --> 02:55:26.731]  And when I when we come back, we're going to be talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman and the Prince Hall paradigm.
[02:55:27.364 --> 02:55:31.135]  That is going to absolutely blow your minds.
[02:55:31.135 --> 02:55:35.507]  We will see you here in about two minutes time on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:43.641 --> 02:55:55.204]  Vicki Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated, and then died.
[02:55:55.204 --> 02:56:00.526]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be intubation.
[02:56:00.526 --> 02:56:01.866]  We know what's going to happen.
[02:56:01.866 --> 02:56:03.267]  It's a blue city.
[02:56:03.267 --> 02:56:04.487]  Same story yet again.
[02:56:04.487 --> 02:56:06.468]  And they say her heart gave out.
[02:56:07.448 --> 02:56:12.330]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube with COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record.
[02:56:12.330 --> 02:56:15.032]  Warn everyone you know before they go into the hospital and get killed.
[02:56:15.032 --> 02:56:18.653]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[02:56:18.653 --> 02:56:25.577]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[02:56:25.577 --> 02:56:29.699]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you.
[02:56:30.359 --> 02:56:35.023]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[02:56:35.023 --> 02:56:39.087]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[02:56:39.087 --> 02:56:41.850]  Don't end up like Vicki Gibbs or everyone.
[02:56:56.866 --> 02:57:04.128]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, with your guest host this afternoon, Bishop Larry Davis.
[02:57:04.128 --> 02:57:10.590]  Again, I am the host and the moderator of the nationally syndicated radio show, the Life Radio Network.
[02:57:10.590 --> 02:57:18.133]  Global spiritual revolution radio through the Life Radio Network, 92.9 FM, 1460 AM, and also we're internationally syndicated
[02:57:18.689 --> 02:57:23.275]  Through the iHeartRadio Network and the iHeartMedia Group here in New York City, New York.
[02:57:23.275 --> 02:57:33.828]  Now, we've been talking about for the past five to six minutes, the title Kanye West on Harriet Tubman and the Prince Hall Paradigm.
[02:57:34.480 --> 02:57:39.802]  Now, Kanye West, a few days ago, was in North Charleston, South Carolina.
[02:57:39.802 --> 02:57:57.630]  The exact geographical location, back during the month of June in 1863, where Harriet Tubman, being backed by the Northern Military Industrial Complex, to free hundreds of slaves
[02:57:58.251 --> 02:58:01.832]  From North Charleston, South Carolina.
[02:58:01.832 --> 02:58:13.014]  Now, Kanye West and Dave Chappelle, these men I call patriots because they're leaving the plantation of the Democratic Party, okay?
[02:58:13.014 --> 02:58:25.556]  And anytime, going back in slavery, okay, here in the Americas and around the world, anytime when a slave was talking liberation, was talking emancipation,
[02:58:26.540 --> 02:58:36.943]  All of the other slaves were trained by their slave masters to call that man or woman mentally unstable.
[02:58:36.943 --> 02:58:49.766]  So what Kanye West is going through and what De Chappelle went through a few years ago is nothing new as we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, and the Prince Hall paradigm.
[02:58:50.356 --> 02:59:10.249]  So to understand why Kim Kardashian, this witch with 10 wigs, 5 weaves, and 3 1⁄2 extensions that she got from a dead horse in India, sacrificing to devils, I don't bite my tongue why I am a contract assassin for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[02:59:10.910 --> 02:59:23.912]  So then Kanye West is being thrown underneath the bus by his wife, Kim Kardashian, and the deep state because Kanye West
[02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:29.884]  is a threat to the demonic order of the left.
[02:59:29.884 --> 02:59:36.469]  So then Harriet Tubman was born in 1822, died in 1913.
[02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:41.513]  And going back into the 1700s, it was through Rothschild money.
[02:59:41.513 --> 02:59:45.676]  And you notice that photo there of Harriet Tubman.
[02:59:45.676 --> 02:59:47.717]  Notice her hands.
[02:59:47.717 --> 02:59:53.862]  That is a high ranking Prince Hall Masonic hand sign.
[02:59:54.358 --> 03:00:06.648]  Yes, according to the book Masonic Abolitionists, Freemasonry, and the Underground Railroad in Illinois by Darryl Lamar Andrews.
[03:00:06.648 --> 03:00:15.915]  He declared that this particular hand sign by Harriet Tubman, it represents that not only was she at Prince Hall Mason,
[03:00:16.936 --> 03:00:31.050]  The Prince Hall Masonic Order was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the hometown of Kobe B. Bryant, during the month of July in 1775, a year before the Declaration of Independence.
[03:00:31.050 --> 03:00:38.677]  And also, Philadelphia is the hometown of not only the Prince Hall Masonic Order, but of the Booley Sacred Society.
[03:00:38.677 --> 03:00:39.337]  We're good to go.
[03:00:57.743 --> 03:01:00.625]  of Prince Hall Masonic Order.
[03:01:00.625 --> 03:01:05.147]  So notice again this book, Masonic Abolitionists, okay?
[03:01:05.147 --> 03:01:08.029]  Excellent picture there, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:08.029 --> 03:01:17.954]  So then, now one may be asking themselves, Bishop, what is a Prince Hall Mason?
[03:01:17.954 --> 03:01:23.777]  A Prince Hall Mason goes back to the man Prince Hall.
[03:01:25.962 --> 03:01:36.631]  So, Prince Hall was the son of a British slave owner, Thomas Prince Hall, who was an agent for the Rothschild British dynasty.
[03:01:45.902 --> 03:01:55.010]  And the mother of Prince Hall was an African American slave or a colored woman who was a slave.
[03:01:55.010 --> 03:02:05.539]  So then Prince Hall created the Black Skulls and Bones, the Prince Hall Masonic Order, which would be the precursor
[03:02:06.167 --> 03:02:12.051]  For the upcoming Boulay Seeker Society, which you and I call Sigma Pi Five.
[03:02:12.051 --> 03:02:28.080]  So then, on the 6th of March in 1775, through Rothschild money, and with the backing of both the British and the Irish Seeker Societies, Prince Hall created the Prince Hall Masonic System.
[03:02:28.886 --> 03:02:29.366]  All right.
[03:02:59.267 --> 03:03:03.637]  But also a man by the name of Albert Pike.
[03:03:03.637 --> 03:03:05.602]  Yes, Albert Pike.
[03:03:06.395 --> 03:03:18.558]  Uh, being one of the faces of the Ku Klux Klan, and as a side note, the Ku Klux Klan was not created by white people.
[03:03:18.558 --> 03:03:33.821]  The Ku Klux Klan was created by a Rothschild agent, a man by the name of Philip Benjamin Judah, who had hired both Nathan Bedford Forrest and Albert Pike
[03:03:34.601 --> 03:03:38.164]  Uh, to be the faces of the Klan.
[03:03:38.164 --> 03:04:01.503]  So, Hollywood, a hollywomb made, being made of a hollywood, has been perpetuating a lie for the past 200 years as we're, uh, methodically and schematically breaking down for you, our students here today, concerning Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, and the Prince Hall paradigm.
[03:04:02.083 --> 03:04:10.530]  And so there are three levels, okay, of what I call the redesignment of slavery.
[03:04:10.530 --> 03:04:13.372]  And this is what Kanye West is going through.
[03:04:13.372 --> 03:04:15.733]  And yes, he told the truth.
[03:04:15.733 --> 03:04:29.063]  So then, there is a three-paradigm mental sign-up of slavery through the Democratic Party that we are eyewitnessing today.
[03:04:29.063 --> 03:04:31.065]  And that is abolition,
[03:04:32.011 --> 03:04:35.234]  Then the word manumission.
[03:04:35.234 --> 03:04:38.456]  Then the term emancipation.
[03:04:38.456 --> 03:04:52.387]  Well, abolitionists like John Brown and Levi Kaufman, they were not friends of black people during their time of systemic enslavement.
[03:04:52.387 --> 03:05:01.594]  These gentlemen, John Brown, Levi Kaufman, Albert Pike, including a man by the name of Rob Morris,
[03:05:02.134 --> 03:05:06.396]  Who was the creator of the Eastern Stars.
[03:05:06.396 --> 03:05:20.981]  So Harriet Tubman was not only an Eastern Star, but she was also a Prince Hall Mason that was specifically chosen.
[03:05:20.981 --> 03:05:23.742]  And I want you to listen to this because this is mind-blowing.
[03:05:23.742 --> 03:05:26.043]  She was specifically chosen
[03:05:27.014 --> 03:05:37.177]  To emancipate the black diaspora from the South to the North, not to liberate black people,
[03:05:38.041 --> 03:05:49.349]  But to recruit engineers and land surveyors to help the northern military and financial industrial complex.
[03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:50.389]  Abolition!
[03:05:50.389 --> 03:06:01.597]  So they sent abolitionists to recruit Harriet Tubman in order to give forth the psyop of what we call manumission.
[03:06:01.597 --> 03:06:03.378]  And what is manumission?
[03:06:04.085 --> 03:06:19.795]  It means slavery that's been redesigned, so once you are touched by an abolitionist or chosen, you are to be redesigned in order to be emancipated.
[03:06:19.795 --> 03:06:24.999]  Though we are free legally, but psychologically and spiritually,
[03:06:25.825 --> 03:06:31.889]  People are only slaves because those people have been redesigned.
[03:06:31.889 --> 03:06:41.014]  We will come back here in the second, in the third segment here on the Alex Jones Show with your guest host and moderator, Bishop Larry Gibbs.
[03:06:41.014 --> 03:06:44.816]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[03:06:44.816 --> 03:06:49.559]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[03:06:49.559 --> 03:06:54.022]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[03:06:54.022 --> 03:06:55.563]  I feel fine.
[03:06:56.932 --> 03:07:01.537]  It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.
[03:07:01.537 --> 03:07:12.587]  This entire takeover has been battle-planned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[03:07:12.587 --> 03:07:14.669]  This is the post-human takeover.
[03:07:14.669 --> 03:07:18.352]  The noose gets tighter when you comply, not looser.
[03:07:19.153 --> 03:07:22.135]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax.
[03:07:22.135 --> 03:07:27.438]  Now they admit that, quote, death numbers are dropping because those are fake, where they count people that died of something else.
[03:07:27.438 --> 03:07:29.239]  But it's all about how many cases there are.
[03:07:29.239 --> 03:07:33.062]  And now they're saying most of the population will get it.
[03:07:33.062 --> 03:07:35.583]  And then no one can go outside ever again.
[03:07:35.583 --> 03:07:37.705]  It's totally insane.
[03:07:37.705 --> 03:07:38.845]  It's a fraud.
[03:07:38.845 --> 03:07:39.746]  It's all a lie.
[03:07:50.157 --> 03:07:56.341]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[03:07:56.341 --> 03:07:59.723]  Where did it come from?

[03:08:43.728 --> 03:08:46.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:01.613 --> 03:09:09.437]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, here with your guest host and moderator this afternoon, Larry Gatiss.
[03:09:09.437 --> 03:09:24.246]  We are discussing for you, our patrons all over the world, the title of this lecture, which is Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, and the Prince Hall Paradigm.
[03:09:24.246 --> 03:09:30.289]  And as a side note, like I said before we went into the last break,
[03:09:30.989 --> 03:09:37.252]  That Harriet Tubman was a Prince Hall Mason.
[03:09:37.252 --> 03:09:43.195]  Harriet Tubman was also a part of the Eastern Stars.
[03:09:43.195 --> 03:09:54.620]  And Harriet Tubman, also her bloodline goes back into Liberia, not just in the past, but even at this very present day.
[03:09:54.620 --> 03:09:56.080]  Another topic for another day.
[03:09:56.080 --> 03:10:00.142]  And there were 16 black men, along with Prince
[03:10:00.162 --> 03:10:00.262]  It's
[03:10:17.365 --> 03:10:26.620]  Which is the biblical, spiritual, demonic foundation of the Black Lives Movement.
[03:10:26.620 --> 03:10:29.545]  It has 16 chapters, or 16 stages.
[03:10:31.511 --> 03:10:31.811]  All right.
[03:10:48.795 --> 03:11:03.228]  During the month of July in 1775 and also there are 16 states of demonic possession in the religion called Odu Aifa, which is the foundation of the 16 chapters
[03:11:04.469 --> 03:11:05.089]  I think so.
[03:11:27.401 --> 03:11:48.751]  Now, later on, for you, our students here today, as we're talking about Harriet Tubman in connection with Kanye West, in connection to the paradigm of what we call the Prince Hall Masonic Order.
[03:11:49.751 --> 03:11:53.553]  Later, Harriet Tubman became a spy.
[03:11:53.553 --> 03:11:54.853]  I want you to listen to this.
[03:11:54.853 --> 03:12:07.058]  She became a spy for the North during the advent of the Civil War, from the 12th of April in 1861 to the 9th of April in 1865.
[03:12:07.058 --> 03:12:13.080]  And she had a powerful codename called Sarthagus.
[03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:14.020]  Wait a minute now.
[03:12:14.020 --> 03:12:15.101]  Her codename
[03:12:16.136 --> 03:12:27.529]  During the Civil War, between 1861 and 1865, was surpacus, and that term surpacus means casket or coffin.
[03:12:27.529 --> 03:12:37.320]  I'll come back to that particular term in the next five minutes as we're talking about Kanye West, Eric Tubman, in the Prince Hall
[03:12:39.641 --> 03:12:57.057]  And so then, later, a man by the name of Frederick Douglass, who created the African Methodist Episcopal Church, along with Richard Allen, along with Absalom Jones, all three of these men were Prince Hall Masons.
[03:12:57.057 --> 03:13:02.923]  Notice the letters, African A, then you have Methodist M,
[03:13:03.689 --> 03:13:23.548]  Then the term Episcopal E. So, the AME Church is a front code for the terms Abolition, Manumission, which means the redesignment of slavery,
[03:13:29.562 --> 03:13:56.330]  That would give the slave Emancipation, capital E. So, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, or the AME Church, that was birthed in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the hometown of Kobe Bryant, the hometown of the Prince Masonic Order, the hometown of the Blue Lace Seeker Society, was also the birthplace
[03:13:56.810 --> 03:13:57.771]  We're good to go.
[03:14:08.923 --> 03:14:16.366]  So, A. Abolition, M. Manumission, and Emancipation.
[03:14:16.366 --> 03:14:37.496]  So, we're going to send Black people in the South, abolitionists like John Brown and Albert Pike, okay, and Levi Kaufman, to bring about the liberation of a people that they don't even love in order to redesign them
[03:14:38.191 --> 03:14:52.456]  From being a legal slave to a psychological slave of re-designment that we call manumission, that's M, in order to emancipate them.
[03:14:52.456 --> 03:15:02.019]  We're not going to emancipate them unless we first re-design them through manumission.
[03:15:02.888 --> 03:15:19.271]  I mean, so nothing is by accident as we're talking about Kanye West, okay, and this so-called, and I know I'm going to get in trouble today, but Harriet Tubman, what Kanye West was talking about, it was absolutely true.
[03:15:19.271 --> 03:15:22.232]  I'm going to bring this out in the next 30 seconds.
[03:15:22.232 --> 03:15:24.533]  So, there were between 70 and 300 slaves
[03:15:27.390 --> 03:15:32.177]  Sixty percent of these slaves were engineers, okay?
[03:15:32.177 --> 03:15:39.668]  Now, Harriet Tubman became a super spy for the North during the Civil War.
[03:15:39.668 --> 03:15:42.452]  And as we move forward here, again, abolition,
[03:15:43.723 --> 03:15:54.525]  Then we bring manumission, the redesignment of the slave, in order to emancipate them e. A.M.E.
[03:15:54.525 --> 03:15:57.605]  or African Methodist Episcopal Church.
[03:15:57.605 --> 03:16:00.666]  I know a lot of preachers are going to disagree with me.
[03:16:00.666 --> 03:16:07.547]  You see, you have to understand, students, that slavery has been redesigned.
[03:16:07.547 --> 03:16:12.528]  Now during the time of the Underground Railroad,
[03:16:13.098 --> 03:16:41.298]  Between 1849 to 1863, this woman, who was also a high-ranking worshipper of the religion of Odu Aifa, Harriet Tubman, made 13 trips, okay, and went through safe houses that were owned by Prince Hall nascents, and she would leave a mark on the wall of these houses
[03:16:42.356 --> 03:16:46.159]  In the form of a compass in the square.
[03:16:46.159 --> 03:16:47.760]  A compass in the square.
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:57.947]  Now, remember during the Civil War, like I said a few minutes ago, the code name for this spy, Harriet Tubman, was CIRCOPUS.
[03:16:57.947 --> 03:17:01.430]  Okay, capital S-A-R-C-O-P-H-A-R-C-O-P-U-S.
[03:17:02.912 --> 03:17:13.677]  G. U. S. Circus or soft cop us, which is a Greek word signifying casket or coffin.
[03:17:13.677 --> 03:17:18.139]  OK, which also means the words are solved.
[03:17:18.139 --> 03:17:18.959]  E.T.
[03:17:18.959 --> 03:17:20.320]  cool.
[03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:26.403]  OK, when you come back during after the next break, we're going to break this down even further.
[03:17:26.403 --> 03:17:28.844]  I know your minds are being blown right now.
[03:17:32.365 --> 03:17:39.750]  And the Prince Hall Paradigm, here with your host, teacher, here today, Bishop Larry Gators.
[03:17:39.750 --> 03:17:44.313]  Historical food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[03:17:44.313 --> 03:17:44.934]  We have it.

[03:17:52.319 --> 03:17:53.379]  It's my patriot.

[03:20:42.334 --> 03:20:44.956]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:57.152 --> 03:21:05.681]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, here with your guest host, moderator, and teacher this afternoon, Bishop Larry Gaters.
[03:21:05.681 --> 03:21:09.085]  I am the host of the nationally syndicated Global Spiritual Revolution Radio.
[03:21:09.585 --> 03:21:14.266]  Through the Life Radio Network, 92.9 FM, 1460 AM here in New York City.
[03:21:14.266 --> 03:21:21.048]  Also, we are internationally syndicated through the iHeart Radio Network and the iHeart Media Group, also here in New York City, New York.
[03:21:21.048 --> 03:21:26.910]  We average between 20 to 25 million listeners each and every week throughout the world in 150 countries.
[03:21:26.910 --> 03:21:36.273]  We're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, Miss Moses, and the paradigm of what we call
[03:21:36.835 --> 03:21:38.918]  Prince Hall Masonic Order.
[03:21:38.918 --> 03:21:49.471]  Okay, now there's another powerful book I want you guys to to get into entitled The Freemasons by Jasper Ridley.
[03:21:50.220 --> 03:21:56.805]  A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Societies.
[03:21:56.805 --> 03:21:59.847]  The Freemasons by Jasper Ridley.
[03:21:59.847 --> 03:22:04.190]  A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Societies.
[03:22:04.190 --> 03:22:14.558]  He says in chapters 3, 4, and 5 that Harriet Tubman was actually paid by the Northern Powers, okay?
[03:22:15.191 --> 03:22:32.743]  During the advent of the Civil War from the 12th of April in 1861 to the 9th of April of 1865, which is the end of the Civil War, she was paid by the Northern Financial and Military Industrial Complex
[03:22:33.483 --> 03:22:41.946]  After the advent of what we call the Civil War, okay, which was not fought to stop slavery, another topic for another day.
[03:22:41.946 --> 03:22:51.349]  So Harriet Tubman was paid for bringing the slaves from the South to the North, which means Kanye West has not lost his mind.
[03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:56.111]  And so we as Black America, we have been lied to.
[03:22:56.966 --> 03:22:59.168]  We are being played.
[03:22:59.168 --> 03:23:02.090]  We are being bamboozled and led astray.
[03:23:02.090 --> 03:23:03.912]  But I'm going to expose this today.
[03:23:03.912 --> 03:23:04.112]  Why?
[03:23:04.112 --> 03:23:08.956]  Because I'm a contract killer representing the kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[03:23:08.956 --> 03:23:09.376]  All right.
[03:23:09.376 --> 03:23:15.761]  So the Freemasons by Jasper Ridley, a history of the world's most powerful secret societies.
[03:23:15.761 --> 03:23:23.327]  Excellent picture there that talks about this woman by the name of Harriet Tubman.
[03:23:24.184 --> 03:23:40.650]  Who had freed hundreds of slaves in North Charleston, South Carolina during the month of June in 1863, the same geographical location where my brother Kanye West had exposed
[03:23:41.294 --> 03:23:45.115]  This fallacy called Harriet Tubman, okay?
[03:23:45.115 --> 03:23:53.018]  Now, as we move forward here, now we're going to be talking about, again, Harriet Tubman was a master spy for the North.
[03:23:53.018 --> 03:23:56.159]  Her code name was Sarphagus, okay?
[03:23:56.159 --> 03:24:04.461]  Capital A-S-A-R-C-O-P-H-A-G-U-S, which is a Greek Hellenistic term, students.
[03:24:04.461 --> 03:24:07.482]  It means coffin or casket.
[03:24:07.482 --> 03:24:10.263]  So, the Northern power structure
[03:24:11.273 --> 03:24:16.758]  Abolition, a, manumission, which means that the slave, though legally they are free,
[03:24:34.542 --> 03:24:42.489]  But psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually, you're not free because you're redesigned.
[03:24:42.489 --> 03:24:44.110]  They're called free slaves.
[03:24:44.110 --> 03:24:48.274]  Notice, they're not called free black men, women, and children.
[03:24:48.274 --> 03:24:50.495]  They're called free slaves.
[03:24:50.495 --> 03:24:51.816]  Watch the wordage.
[03:24:51.816 --> 03:25:01.805]  So, abolition, manumission, which is the redesignment of the slave, before they become emancipated.
[03:25:02.325 --> 03:25:15.055]  AME, or the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which is the Trojan horse for the sign of abolition, manunism, and emancipation.
[03:25:15.055 --> 03:25:18.658]  As we're talking about Kanye West, okay?
[03:25:18.658 --> 03:25:19.939]  Harriet Tubman,
[03:25:23.982 --> 03:25:36.651]  So, again, notice the letter G in the middle of the compass in the square, which is a Masonic global symbol.
[03:25:36.651 --> 03:25:46.458]  So, that letter, capital G, within the Masonic order, it means geometric.
[03:25:47.276 --> 03:25:53.920]  Something that is geometry, or what we call geometry.
[03:25:53.920 --> 03:26:05.126]  So, when we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, in the Prince Hall paradigm, we have to pray for our brother, okay?
[03:26:05.126 --> 03:26:06.467]  Kanye West.
[03:26:06.467 --> 03:26:11.290]  Because, I gotta say this, his life is on the line, okay?
[03:26:12.088 --> 03:26:14.129]  His life is on the line.
[03:26:14.129 --> 03:26:39.064]  So, we gotta pray for him because there are powers that be in this country that want to take him out by diagnosing him as schizophrenic, as post-traumatic stress disordered, as a schizophrenic type of person that is unstable.
[03:26:39.921 --> 03:26:52.786]  Allow me to bust your bubble here today as we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, and the paradigm called the Prince Hall Masonic Order.
[03:26:52.786 --> 03:26:58.628]  So, Kanye West decided to leave the Democratic Plantation.
[03:26:58.628 --> 03:27:06.231]  And by the way, the Democratic Party instituted the system of slavery.
[03:27:06.966 --> 03:27:10.987]  The Republican Party had nothing to do with slavery.
[03:27:10.987 --> 03:27:15.008]  The GOP had nothing to do with slavery.
[03:27:15.008 --> 03:27:27.292]  So it was a Rothschild agent by the name, again, an attorney who never graduated from law school, but his name was Judah Philip Benjamin.
[03:27:28.332 --> 03:27:50.013]  In July of 1865, in Pulaski, Tennessee, along with Albert Pike and Nathan Bedford Forrest, more specifically Albert Pike, who was one of the so-called abolitionists that not only chose Harriet Tubman, but provided the schematical blueprint
[03:27:50.753 --> 03:27:59.898]  Of the caves, of the underground networks, okay, that was created with Rothschild money going back into 1700.
[03:27:59.898 --> 03:28:03.519]  How would Harriet Tubman know where to go?
[03:28:03.519 --> 03:28:11.663]  Because she was financially backed by the global deep state through the Rothschilds during this time.
[03:28:11.663 --> 03:28:17.506]  Just like Black Lives Matter is being a tool of manipulation.
[03:28:17.506 --> 03:28:18.927]  Always remember this, students.
[03:28:19.566 --> 03:28:26.212]  Knowing enough about a subject to think you're right, but not enough about the subject to know you're wrong.
[03:28:26.212 --> 03:28:34.059]  So my assignment today is to reveal that Kanye West is not crazy.
[03:28:34.059 --> 03:28:37.762]  Kanye West has not lost his mind.
[03:28:37.762 --> 03:28:43.788]  Kanye West is marked for death because anytime a slave
[03:28:44.827 --> 03:28:47.770]  Thanks about leaving the plantation.
[03:28:47.770 --> 03:28:49.931]  And notice the term plantation.
[03:28:49.931 --> 03:28:53.454]  Plan or plant.
[03:28:53.454 --> 03:29:00.921]  So a plantational thinking person is looked upon as a entertainer.
[03:29:01.874 --> 03:29:10.500]  His name is 50 Cent, Quarter, Nickel, Penny, Ice Tube, Ice Cube, Ice Tray, Pit Bull, Little Bow Wow.
[03:29:10.500 --> 03:29:13.062]  Notice that term, plantation.
[03:29:13.062 --> 03:29:22.268]  It has to have a plan in order to plant a seed within your psychology.
[03:29:22.268 --> 03:29:30.514]  And as we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, in the Prince Hall paradigm, every black person
[03:29:31.389 --> 03:29:41.953]  of any financial significance is not only a Bully Seeker Society member, but they are a Prince Hall Mason, okay?
[03:29:41.953 --> 03:29:49.075]  As we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, in the Prince Hall paradigm, okay?
[03:29:49.075 --> 03:29:55.758]  And this is the reason why many black people in this nation are not free.
[03:29:56.423 --> 03:30:04.720]  Because the Democratic Party was not designed to liberate black people.
[03:30:05.445 --> 03:30:24.661]  It was designed for you to have a race card with an unlimited balance in order for you to be kept in victimhood and self-enslavement as a redesigned slave in order for you to be emancipated.
[03:30:24.661 --> 03:30:32.928]  We're going to take a quick break here and we'll be back here in the next few minutes as we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman, and the Prince Hall Paradigm.
[03:30:39.508 --> 03:30:55.055]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings standing on top of an American flag is Nazi!
[03:30:55.055 --> 03:31:00.597]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-check it and say, yes, now the American flag
[03:31:00.917 --> 03:31:02.919]  And yes, the American Eagle are Nazis.
[03:31:02.919 --> 03:31:09.603]  No, George Soros that funds Snopes and Media Matters and the rest of them, he's the real Nazi collaborator.
[03:31:09.603 --> 03:31:12.645]  But this shirt, I think, is really the perfect campaign shirt.
[03:31:12.645 --> 03:31:15.447]  We've made one even better than what Trump's people came up with.
[03:31:15.447 --> 03:31:24.274]  Two different versions of it, with something even worse, the Betsy Ross flag, our first flag, that they also say is racist, even though she was a famous abolitionist.
[03:31:24.974 --> 03:31:27.377]  These shirts are at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:27.377 --> 03:31:29.960]  They're the American Eagle Betsy Ross flags.
[03:31:29.960 --> 03:31:34.526]  Two different designs, guaranteed to spread the word, and of course, trigger lip tarts everywhere.
[03:31:34.526 --> 03:31:36.348]  Exercise your first amendment or loosen.
[03:31:36.348 --> 03:31:37.129]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:38.775 --> 03:31:41.556]  We close and lock our doors and windows at night.
[03:31:41.556 --> 03:31:45.417]  Not because we're doing anything wrong, but because it's about privacy.
[03:31:45.417 --> 03:31:46.978]  And it's about security.
[03:31:46.978 --> 03:31:49.699]  And it's something that we do to protect ourselves.
[03:31:49.699 --> 03:31:56.782]  Going back thousands of years, when we would post a dog or a sentry at the entrance of the village, so we would know if predators or criminals were coming.
[03:31:56.782 --> 03:32:04.785]  Well, big tech, along with the federal government and other globalist organizations, have been tracking everybody illegally for years with their cell phones.
[03:32:04.785 --> 03:32:05.305]  But now,
[03:32:05.765 --> 03:32:09.427]  The public is finally waking up because the enemy has openly announced it's the fact.
[03:32:09.427 --> 03:32:15.851]  And the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative with Chelsea is running the private system to spy on you and your family.
[03:32:15.851 --> 03:32:21.255]  That's right, the Democrats, the Globalists, the Chaikovs, they've all got our number, they're tracking us in Lifetime.
[03:32:21.255 --> 03:32:24.577]  But with Privacy Pockets, the best system at Infowarstore.com,
[03:32:25.177 --> 03:32:26.518]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[03:32:26.518 --> 03:32:27.219]  Where did it come from?
[03:32:59.632 --> 03:33:03.934]  We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.

[03:33:36.170 --> 03:33:38.512]  Other systems, just don't compare.
[03:33:40.089 --> 03:33:42.671]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[03:33:42.671 --> 03:33:55.481]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[03:33:55.981 --> 03:33:56.702]  I think so.
[03:34:16.005 --> 03:34:20.007]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[03:34:20.007 --> 03:34:25.269]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[03:34:25.269 --> 03:34:33.112]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[03:34:33.112 --> 03:34:36.953]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[03:34:36.953 --> 03:34:38.994]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[03:34:43.317 --> 03:34:45.942]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:34:59.457 --> 03:35:15.306]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show this afternoon for our last segment here with your host, guest and moderator and teacher this afternoon, Bishop Larry Gators of the Global Spiritual Revolution Radio through the Life Radio Network, 92.9 FM, 1460 AM on your dial.
[03:35:15.306 --> 03:35:21.410]  We are internationally syndicated through the iHeart Radio Network in the iHeartMedia Group, also here in New York City, New York.
[03:35:21.410 --> 03:35:23.871]  And please subscribe to our YouTube channel.
[03:35:23.871 --> 03:35:28.054]  Go to youtube.com for a slash C or a slash
[03:35:28.454 --> 03:35:46.806]  Global Spiritual Revolution Radio Media Group, or just type in Global Spiritual Revolution Radio and you will receive weekly teachings, not just from the Bishop as the host of my own nationally syndicated radio talk show, but also my guest appearances on radio shows and podcasts all over the world.
[03:35:46.806 --> 03:35:57.453]  All right, Kanye West, okay, in our last segment, Harriet Tubman in the paradigm of Prince Hall, or what we call the Prince Hall
[03:35:57.993 --> 03:35:59.914]  We're good to go.
[03:36:16.478 --> 03:36:20.339]  of a secret society called the Knights Templar.
[03:36:20.339 --> 03:36:24.541]  So the term Templar means temple or the mine.
[03:36:24.541 --> 03:36:25.241]  Okay.
[03:36:25.241 --> 03:36:37.185]  And so the Knights Templar became the first global military industrial complex representing the financial interests of the global Vatican system.
[03:36:37.185 --> 03:36:38.105]  Okay.
[03:36:38.105 --> 03:36:39.905]  Now, it's very interesting.
[03:36:39.905 --> 03:36:44.447]  If all you guys get an opportunity to go to Google Images and type in Balfour Met,
[03:36:45.927 --> 03:36:49.888]  So, the Knights Templar are uplifting Baphomet.
[03:36:49.888 --> 03:36:51.868]  And the code word for Baphomet is Mohammed.
[03:37:12.185 --> 03:37:14.468]  From whence we get the term Mohammed.
[03:37:14.468 --> 03:37:24.499]  Notice at the top of the skull, if you guys can go back to that photo, notice the top of the skull of Balfour Meade is a lamb.
[03:37:24.499 --> 03:37:27.263]  OK, now we have a statue.
[03:37:27.263 --> 03:37:30.727]  Keep that picture there as we're talking about Kanye West, Harriet Tubman.
[03:37:31.067 --> 03:37:39.776]  We are in the Prince Hall Paradigm here on the Alex Jones Show with your host, moderator, and guest host, Bishop Larry Gators.
[03:37:39.776 --> 03:37:51.167]  Now, notice the lamp on the top of the head of Balfour Mac, who is a part goat, part man, part woman, part beast.
[03:37:51.167 --> 03:37:51.808]  Excellent there.
[03:37:52.288 --> 03:38:05.321]  And so, there is a paradigm in black America, especially in the black sports vernacular, which they say that person is the GOAT.
[03:38:05.321 --> 03:38:07.423]  Capital G, period.
[03:38:07.423 --> 03:38:08.885]  Capital O, period.
[03:38:09.325 --> 03:38:09.986]  We're good to go.
[03:38:31.821 --> 03:38:32.642]  About that.
[03:38:32.642 --> 03:38:40.786]  And you can go to the next picture that you guys had, where it shows the term Solve E.T.
[03:38:40.786 --> 03:38:41.587]  Coragula.
[03:38:41.587 --> 03:38:42.527]  There you go.
[03:38:42.527 --> 03:38:54.874]  And so that term Solve Coragula or Coragulation is tattooed on the forearm of the British writer J.K.
[03:38:54.874 --> 03:38:57.636]  Rowling of the Harry Potter series.
[03:39:01.218 --> 03:39:01.818]  E.T.
[03:39:01.818 --> 03:39:18.046]  Coragulis simply means, students, that the Deep State will dissolve a certain population or populace that will give way to have room for the global elite.
[03:39:18.046 --> 03:39:21.028]  So if you guys can one more time go back to that Balfour Mint picture
[03:39:21.468 --> 03:39:25.974]  Where the men are lifting him up on a chair.
[03:39:25.974 --> 03:39:27.836]  The one before this, yes.
[03:39:27.836 --> 03:39:31.340]  So the Knights Templar are lifting him up on a chair.
[03:39:31.340 --> 03:39:35.125]  But notice again, the lamp, OK?
[03:39:35.125 --> 03:39:36.487]  On the top of his head.
[03:39:36.487 --> 03:39:39.791]  This is where we get the term Illuminato.
[03:39:40.538 --> 03:39:41.878]  I don't know.
[03:39:58.224 --> 03:39:59.945]  It is written from right to left.
[03:39:59.945 --> 03:40:06.669]  You get a Latin Vulgate expression, re-final, which means the recycling of the command.
[03:40:06.669 --> 03:40:09.491]  OK, that's interesting, including in Ezekiel 28, 13.
[03:40:09.491 --> 03:40:19.717]  The first three stones upon the breast of Lucifer were Sardis, S, Topaz, T, Diamond, D, STD, sexually transmitted diseases.
[03:40:19.717 --> 03:40:22.559]  But that lamp on the top of the head of
[03:40:27.495 --> 03:40:29.157]  of the Statue of Liberty.
[03:40:29.157 --> 03:40:30.798]  I got your attention now.
[03:40:30.798 --> 03:40:40.906]  Well, who is the woman who is portrayed as the symbol of liberty here in New York Harbor?
[03:40:40.906 --> 03:40:50.755]  A former communist, Marxist, and socialist, a woman by the name of Emma Lazarus.
[03:40:51.619 --> 03:40:55.921]  Emma Lazarus was a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Mason.
[03:40:55.921 --> 03:40:56.841]  There you go.
[03:40:56.841 --> 03:41:02.704]  Emma Lazarus was a communist and a socialist, okay?
[03:41:02.704 --> 03:41:05.625]  Who wrote the Great Colossus, okay?
[03:41:06.363 --> 03:41:11.809]  She had a teenager protege by the name of Emma Goldman, okay?
[03:41:11.809 --> 03:41:22.259]  So, both Emma Lazarus and later Emma Goldman received their financial backing from Tammany Hall right here in New York City.
[03:41:22.259 --> 03:41:28.145]  As we're talking about in our conclusion, Kanye West, okay, here at Tubman,
[03:41:28.605 --> 03:41:31.428]  Uh, in the Prince Hall paradigm.
[03:41:31.428 --> 03:41:34.752]  So, then, Balfour May is lifted on that chair.
[03:41:34.752 --> 03:41:48.546]  Now, remember, a few years ago, Bishop Eddie Long, God rest his soul, in his church, was lifted by black men, okay, there you go, on a chair.
[03:41:49.389 --> 03:42:11.473]  That is a Prince Hall Masonic initiation, signifying that Eddie Long, even though he's carrying the Torah, but Eddie Long has just been initiated into the dark altar of what we call Prince Hall Freemasonry.
[03:42:11.473 --> 03:42:18.434]  Oh, this is powerful stuff here, as we're talking about not just Kanye West and Harriet Tubman,
[03:42:18.994 --> 03:42:23.848]  But the paradigm call, Prince Hall Masonry.
[03:42:24.928 --> 03:42:32.072]  All of these black preachers, not all, but a great percentage, are Prince Hall Masons.
[03:42:32.072 --> 03:42:37.455]  The attorney, Benjamin Crump, I'm sure that you've heard of Benjamin Crump.
[03:42:37.455 --> 03:42:44.999]  Benjamin Crump is the attorney representing the family of George Floyd and Trayvon Martin.
[03:42:44.999 --> 03:42:52.083]  Benjamin Crump is not only a part of the Boulez Society, of Sigma
[03:42:54.143 --> 03:43:22.152]  But according to the Benjamin Crump Institute website, okay, under about Benjamin Crump, okay, paragraph 3, sections 4 and 5, it says that Benjamin Crump is not only Sigma Pi Phi Bule, he's also a Prince Hall Mason, he's also a member of the Michael R. Moore Lodge in Tallahassee, Florida.
[03:43:22.572 --> 03:43:30.218]  Notice the term Tallahassee or the term olive is inserted in Tallahassee.
[03:43:30.218 --> 03:43:33.521]  So, we're getting back to Conway, okay?
[03:43:33.521 --> 03:43:34.962]  Kanye West.
[03:43:34.962 --> 03:43:40.866]  We have to pray for him because the deep state wants to take him out.
[03:43:40.866 --> 03:43:44.169]  Also, not just Kanye West and Gay Chappelle.
[03:43:44.169 --> 03:43:51.995]  There was a book that was eventually banned by Barnes & Noble called The Adrenochrome Witch.
[03:43:52.979 --> 03:43:54.781]  I got an electronic copy.
[03:43:54.781 --> 03:44:03.769]  The Adrenochrome Witch by the R&B rapper Sean Puffy Combs, or P-Day.
[03:44:03.769 --> 03:44:15.621]  So I'm coming on 10 for a Hat podcast, the 29th of this month, next week, to talk about the coming global destruction of darkness.
[03:44:16.602 --> 03:44:18.104]  Keep that picture right there.
[03:44:18.104 --> 03:44:21.508]  The coming destruction of global darkness.
[03:44:21.508 --> 03:44:30.379]  Where Sean P. Diddy Combs is exposing the Hollywood Adrenochrome Witch Seeker Society.
[03:44:31.781 --> 03:44:35.943]  Notice Wayfair putting children into furniture.
[03:44:35.943 --> 03:44:37.323]  That's nothing new.
[03:44:37.323 --> 03:44:51.529]  That goes back to three to four thousand years within the Babylonian Empire where mothers and fathers would sacrifice a child once a year and put that child inside of a piece of furniture
[03:44:51.889 --> 03:44:55.391]  That was shaped like the house god or demon.
[03:44:55.391 --> 03:45:07.075]  And that charm inside of that furniture, going back three to four thousand years within the Babylonian Empire, was to be sacrificed unto Astaroth, Balaam, a Molec.
[03:45:07.075 --> 03:45:08.756]  That's way fair.
[03:45:08.756 --> 03:45:11.017]  Nothing is by accident.
[03:45:11.017 --> 03:45:11.297]  As we're
[03:45:16.161 --> 03:45:24.012]  Harriet Tubman and the Prince Hall Paradigm with your host, teacher, and hosting moderator, Bishop Larry Gibbs.
[03:45:24.012 --> 03:45:26.976]  Thank you so much for being with us this afternoon.
[03:45:26.976 --> 03:45:27.357]  God bless.
