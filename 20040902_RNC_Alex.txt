[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]  Network, this is Erskine, sitting in today and tomorrow for Alex Jones.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  Be sure and pick up a copy of Alex's videos.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  ThePrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, The American Dictators.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  The staged election of 2004 is one of the videos available,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  and the person who did the video is with us right now.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  Alex Jones, direct from his interview that he got out on C-SPAN,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]  as Sharon told us at the very first hour.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  Alex, welcome to your own program.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  Yes, sir. Erskine, I'm sorry I called in late.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  I was here at Ground Zero.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  Despite the fact that the 9-11 truth group has a permit to be here,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  I was just threatened with arrest and had to get myself out of that
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]  and had to basically threaten to sue them to have them leave me alone.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]  And as I'm speaking, you've got the cameras rolling just to document everything
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  in case they try something.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]  I've almost been arrested three times every day,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  anywhere in the city videotaping anything.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  It's an absolute nightmare.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  Just so much has happened.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]  And what I'll do is, I guess the last 20 minutes of the program,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  I'm going to call in and get everybody to get an update
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  on what's happened in the last day.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  There is just so much here that we're surrounded by police,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  and they're coming in with plastic handcuffs.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  What they'll do is just encircle peaceful crowds with this orange netting
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  and then round everybody up and arrest them.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]  There's over 2,000 people that they put in a camp,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  Pier 57, an old condemned bus terminal where they parked the buses
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  to try a facility out over the Hudson River.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  It's been called Guantanamo on the Hudson.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  We were threatened with arrest there as well.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  We've had them grab cameras and smash them right in front of us.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  They were so stupid.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  They didn't know our other camera was rolling getting this.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  This city is in total martial law, surveillance blunts,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  helicopters everywhere, military on the streets, militarized police.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  It is just utterly disgusting.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  2,000 people in a condemned building that the bus company pulled people out of.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  They pulled people out of about six years ago because the asbestos is hanging down.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  They have barbed wire inside in condemned facilities with port-a-potties outside.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  People have to beg to use the bathroom.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]  2,000 people at any one time locked up in this giant pen.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  It has been total bedlam.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]  It is so exciting though.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  I've run into probably 500, 600 people now that are fans of the radio show
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  and aware of the new world order.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  I had no idea we were this big in New York.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  God bless everybody and God bless those out there listening.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]  We are going to prevail.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  We are never going to stop fighting.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]  This is just totally and completely insane to be threatened with arrest at least three times a day.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  To have one of our cameras taken and then smashed right in front of us
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  and have the phone ripped out of it.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  Just busting behavior.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  Hundreds of the people that have been arrested are literally foreign tourists.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  Old ladies in wheelchairs.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  They will just block off a whole street in a quote authorized protest.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  Come in with this orange netting.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  Round everybody up.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  They will ride horses into people.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  They will ride mopeds into people to cause crises.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  Many of the anarchists work for them and have been threatening us.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  There are just a few hundred anarchists that are used to create crises.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  The march on Sunday had over 300,000 people in it.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  There have been huge protests everywhere.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  The news is totally distorting all of this, Erskine.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  It's not on CNN.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  It's not on NBC, ABC, CBS.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  The estimates of the crowd is anywhere from 250 to 500,000
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  but it is covered by the foreign press.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  We are not allowed to see it ourselves.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]  Are we in New York City, police state 2004?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  Is this a police state?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  Is this what you were talking about?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  It is a total police state.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  Is it here now in New York?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  It is.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  Everything is color of law.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  There is no law against filming but anywhere you are on the street doing anything,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  they will treat you like dogs.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  They are on a total power trip.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  They are hyped up and just raging.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  Anybody that shows any fear automatically gets arrested.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  I've noticed you have to buck up and bull up and say,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  I've got the first amendment.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  You do whatever you want, buddy.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  Right now they were getting the cuffs out about to arrest me here at a march
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  that actually has a permit in front of Ground Zero.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  We're here talking about 9-11.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  We're here talking about who is behind 9-11.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  I have them threaten to arrest me again saying that my press pass wasn't proper.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  If I even need a press pass to be here, this is absolutely disgusting.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  It sickens me to see America being turned into this
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  but it's only going to get worse and worse and worse because of what these scoundrels have done.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  The globalists have come back to the scene of the crime.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  They have come back to the scene of what they did on 9-11
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  and we are going to continue to stand up against them.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  And last time I got live on C-SPAN, kind of guerrilla information warfare tactic
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  and got the truth out, Erskine, you've obviously already heard about that.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  We've heard about it.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]  We're trying to get a video of it.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  And you've got 50% according to the Zogby poll of the New Yorkers are aware
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  that the 9-11 was planned, that they knew about it.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  50% according to the Zogby poll.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  You are in an area where the people know and they understand.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  Is this getting out on local TV?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  Let me give folks the actual Zogby poll.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  39% in New York City finally got a copy of it.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  49% in New York City believe it was government prior knowledge or involvement.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  In New York State itself, 41% believe that.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  And 68% want Elliot Spitzer to do an independent investigation
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  and do not believe in the 9-11 whitewash commission
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  appointed by George W. New World Order liberal Bush.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones live report from New York
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  and Harry Brown and Paul Joseph Watson who are also going to be talking with Alex
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  right after these words.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.

[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  It's finally here. Spring has arrived.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  You can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too,

[00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  Music
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  This is the only place, this is the Alex Jones program, where you're going to understand what's going on for real in New York
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  and the poll results.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  May 26, Toronto Star reported a national poll showed that 63, 63% of Canadians are convinced that U.S. leaders
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  had prior knowledge of the attacks and yet declined to act.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  66% of New Yorkers, according to the Zogby poll just released August 30,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]  called for a new probe of unanswered questions by Congress or New York's Attorney General.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  You've got 49.3% of New York residents and 41% of the New York citizens overall say that some of our leaders knew in advance
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001 and they consciously failed to act.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  That is half, half of the New York City residents.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]  This is ground zero where it happened.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  New York City, they're not buying the government version.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  They know that it is order out of chaos, elite-sponsored terrorism and New World Order.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  The report on what's going on right from ground zero, I want you to hear it again from Alex Jones,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  the man who's there who was almost arrested three times.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  Alex, give that report again.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  How bad is it?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  It's unspeakable. It's indescribable.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]  Again, I'm here at ground zero surrounded by survivors of 9-11, people who were here,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  people, I talked to a bunch of people who were there at firefighters saying get back.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  We're about to bring down Building 7.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  People even heard it on NPR that day.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]  It's admitted that they blew up Building 7.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  The owner has even gone on television and said we made the decision to pull it.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]  I'm right here by Silverstein Properties.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  I'm right here just 50 feet from the bed surrounded by police with their clubs out just staring at us.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  It's disgusting.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  Some of the boys who talk to you are aware of what's happening.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  But as you said, they cannot hide this forever.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  The polls, you just read that the Canadian poll was 60-plus percent think it's a big cover-up.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  Most New Yorkers think it's a big cover-up.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  It is unbelievable.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  And just to see this country going to hell in a handbasket is very, very painful.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  Now folks, here is a survivor, a lady who worked in the center.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]  Ma'am, can you tell us your name and why you're out here handing out information, deception dollars,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]  and the 9-11 truth movement pamphlets to people.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  Can you tell us, just in a nutshell, what most New Yorkers are thinking
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  and some of the key things that you think are cover-ups involving 9-11?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]  Well, at a minimum, that 7 World Trade Act...
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  Tell us your name.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  My name is Andrea.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  So I have worked and lived in New York for more than 20 years
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  and happen to have been working in the downtown area.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  Actually, I was working in the World Financial Center complex on the day of September 11.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  I was in the building during the night before.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]  I'm a member of a professional association on the 44th floor of 1 World Trade.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  I supervised an office in 1 World Trade back in the mid-'80s.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  What are some of the key points you told me about earlier?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]  Some of the key points are that there were explosives up through 6 World Trade
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  that I heard before Ida Tower came down.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  7 World Trade we knew was not in bad condition, and later on in the day on live radio
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]  where one of our local live reporters was downtown with New York Public Radio.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]  He was saying that the building wasn't in bad condition,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  but they were talking about demolishing it.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  And, you know, why would you demolish a building in perfectly good condition?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  But, meanwhile, that building came down lickety-split.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]  It came down within moments after that.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  And we already knew that, but now we have Lonnie Silverstein saying it on PBS.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  Let me get another quick comment from another lady, then I'm going to come back to you.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  Man, I was talking to you.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]  You live down here.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]  You talk to the widows.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  You talk to the locals.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]  Can you tell us about people who were discussing the explosives and the rest of it,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  and you said you talked to locals who were told to get back there
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  about to bring down Building 7.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  Can you repeat that for the listeners?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  They said, I'm Arlene Rubin, and they said over and over again
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  that from the face of the building and from the mid-floor
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  that explosives were bringing down the World Trade Center to run for your life.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  They said explosives were bringing it down to run for your life.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  Building 7 was blown when they said the words Larry Silverstein.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]  They told them they're going to pull it.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]  That means that the building has already been armed, wired with explosives.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  Prior wiring with explosives, Alex.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  It's incredible, Erskine.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  I know you've got Harry Brown and Paul Watson there.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  Why don't you bring those guys up?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  I don't want to monopolize it.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]  Absolutely.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  Paul, Harry, anything you want to ask Alex right now at Ground Zero?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  Well, yes.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  I mean, if I can jump in, I'd just ask Alex.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]  I mean, we've had reports about police arresting medics
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  so that the handcuffed and beaten protesters couldn't get treatment.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  We've got video, Paul.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  We've got video of them with giant orange construction fences
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  rounding up peaceful, permanent protests.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]  They put 2,000 of them just in the last two days in this camp down here.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  We call it Guantanamo and the Hudson.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  This giant complex.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  They just live in motor oil on the ground, an old bus terminal.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  Literally with barbed wire fences and barbed wire inside the description,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]  just like in my film, The Takeover,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  with the barbed wire inside the 747 hangar in Austin, Texas.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]  This is gulag America.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]  Go ahead, Paul.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  Well, yes, and those articles have been in the New York Daily News.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  Also, we've had reports about black bloc anarchist provocateurs
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  setting fire to trash cans,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  and then when the people go up and ask them which group they're affiliated with,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]  they don't give a response, though.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]  Have you seen any kind of provocateurs?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  Yes, we've been threatened by the Communists.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  They said, we wish China would kill you.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  Most of the so-called anarchists are really Communists.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  They seem to be working with the police.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  They're never arrested.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]  They'll go burn something or punch somebody or throw something at a cop.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]  Then they pull back, and a police captain will give an order,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  and they'll rush them with horses or mopeds and run over crowds.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  When people fight back, there's a riot, and they begin, pell-mell.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  There'll be 600, 800 armed ninja, outfitted, armored, outfitted cops
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  who will run out of a parking garage who are just waiting.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  These are staged events.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  They will usher a crowd of a few thousand people.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  There's dozens of small protests going on spontaneously everywhere.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  They will usher them down a few streets.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  Tell them, go this way, go that way, come with us.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]  Then they get people hoarded into a spot.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  Then the anarchists do something,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  and then waiting cops come running out of parking garages
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  or waiting buses to beat the living daylights out of them.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  This is nowhere on U.S. media.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  You're not seeing it anywhere.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  Comment on that, Alex.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  Well, I mean, basically, I'd like to hear from Harry Brown,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  but I mean, there is a total media blackout.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  They're distorting the news.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  There is no liberal or conservative media.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  It's globalist corporate media that's not free market.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  They're organized criminals.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  Does Mr. Brown have any comments?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  Well, obviously, it's a terrible situation.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]  I want to take a look on the web and see if CNN or NBC
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]  or any of these networks are putting it at least up on the Internet.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]  And, of course, I don't sit and watch network news all day long,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]  and I have no idea what's going on on TV.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  Does anybody else here, has anybody else watched TV this morning?
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  Well, at night, when I get in at 2 a.m. after these 14-, 15-hour days,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]  I'll watch Fox, I'll watch CNN,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  and the first few days, it's like everything's great.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  We'll see in the report on the protest, but Fox is like,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  everything's great.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]  These workers love us.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]  Man, things are really going well.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]  Meanwhile, I'm outside with hundreds of thousands of people going,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  I mean, it's just a complete opposite of what the news is portraying.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  Now, the New York media is reporting on a lot of this,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]  but not on the provocateur nature of these anarchists.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  It is being reported in foreign news, Alex.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]  It's being reported on German, it's being reported on BBC,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  it's being reported on Canadian.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  The foreign news services are covering the demonstrations.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]  Well, I'll tell you what, I want you to talk to Kevin Booth,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  who's a cameraman and also working with me on this film.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  Kevin's over here running the camera.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  I'll tell you what, can we take over for Kevin?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]  And then I want you to describe how they took our camera away
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]  and smashed it the other night on the bus.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]  But, Kevin, here's Erskine, here's Harry Brown, the famous libertarian,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  and, of course, Paul Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  Just give them a run now.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  What's going on?
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  Hi, Kevin.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  What's going on over there?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  It's pretty crazy.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  I mean, everywhere we're going, you know,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]  there's a group gathering around Alex.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]  And it's pretty crazy because the police really don't know what to make of him,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  you know.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  And, you know, they keep coming up to him,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  but, of course, he doesn't back down at all.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  So they kind of just are standing out of arm's reach of Alex the whole time.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  But they're definitely keeping an eye on us the whole time.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  Last time we were here at the 9-11 site,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]  we were having some kind of government agent guy taking still photographs of our faces,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]  right out of a movie.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000]  I mean, like a plant-closed eye with like a hand vest on with a classic, you know, big zoom lens camera.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]  And, you know, just standing there taking close-up stills of all of our faces.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]  And so I know I'm on the list of Alex now, officially on the list.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  And we've had some crazy moments.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]  Tell them about the port.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]  Well, what about the port?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]  Well, tell them about the jet boat chasers.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]  Yeah, it was that thing.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]  We went out, a friend of ours has a really fast boat.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]  He's a fan of Alex.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]  He has like a cigarette ocean racer.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  And he took us out at night to show the Statue of Liberty.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]  And we had the Homeland Security boat come up to us.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  They're just like out of the scene apocalypse now,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  where the boats come up and they do the search of you.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  And this is funny because the guy, you know, they kind of play a game of intimidation with him.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]  But after we were okay with him, he just took off in one direction.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]  The boats like gave chase to us.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  And this guy just kind of plays the game and he just hit the throttle full blast.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  We watched the little flashing cherry lights disappear over the horizon.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]  Tell them about the guns though.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  Yeah, they had .50 caliber machine guns mounted on the front of these Homeland Security boats and Coast Guard boats.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]  And then we had to take a subway back because we didn't get a taxi cab.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]  And we had a situation where we saw this really sad scene with this old lady.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]  She looked, you know, we all felt really sorry for her.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  She's like terribly hunchbacked and sleeping in a subway station.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  And, you know, we all felt really horrible.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  She was asleep so John Staten, our gate, got out of the subway for a second,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]  I think for like a $5 or $10 bill inside of her purse.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  And we videotaped us doing it and the police jumped out and grabbed Alex's camera.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]  And, you know, they shut down the subway.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  They got us off.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]  They were going to like detain us at the station for a really long time.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  And then this other woman that was there with us took a picture of them.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]  They ended up like tearing all the film out of her camera.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]  And, you know, even when we went to the convention last night,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]  there's just one person after another like grabbing your pass and checking on you.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]  So it's like you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]  If you have like a, if you have a short hair and you look like a Republican
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  and have a Republican pass, you know, then you've got one group of people screaming at you.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]  If you look kind of a liberal or like you have long hair,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]  then you've got the police surrounding you.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]  I was in conditions.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]  And, you know, in Austin where I live, if I see like just a couple of cops here or there,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]  I keep an eye out for them or just whatever.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  I don't break the law.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]  So, you know, you're aware of them.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  But here after just four or five days, I noticed myself just walking past this 50 to 100 police
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]  and it's like you don't even know that they're there anymore.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]  I was sitting like a police friend at dinner the other night.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]  They all had like big machine guns.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]  And I'm sitting there talking about how I needed to buy a police scanner so I could keep up with it all
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]  because I was like not even paying attention to them.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]  I'm so numb to the fact that they're all surrounding me.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]  Kevin, you also talked about your condition when you went out to get pasta.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  Kevin, has it become an us versus them mentality?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000]  Although, you know, the sad thing is a lot of the cops probably as people, they're probably not bad people as people.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]  Or even, you know, I spent a lot of time in Los Angeles and I think the LAPD, they have like a meaner mentality.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000]  And when you get these guys off separately by themselves, they all seem to be like nice people.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]  But it's definitely like a group thing for sure, all together.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]  And when you're out there on the street, they just kind of have this invincible attitude, you know.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]  When they get mad at you or they ratchet up to have a reason to like come after you,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  you can be the most reasonable, normal person and they'll just start screaming in your face.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]  And it's completely unnecessary, you know.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000]  There's just situations where it's just a couple of police and us and, you know, we're walking around with a camera.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]  We have, you know, photo pads. We're nicely dressed.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]  And these guys are in your face screaming at you and you're just, you know.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]  What are you expecting tonight?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  Well, I have no idea.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]  You know, the anarchists have been threatening like some big surprise for the last three days.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  The police think that they're kind of like, you know, they keep saying, oh, tonight at seven and then it doesn't happen.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]  Tomorrow at three and then it doesn't happen.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  So the police and everybody's kind of on edge waiting for the anarchists to pull some big surprise.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]  So we have no idea. We have no idea if you go either way.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000]  I know they have a secret train underground ready for us to take George Bush off the island, you know, ASIP.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]  Harry Paul, any questions?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]  Yeah, I'll just jump in there and ask Kevin.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:46.000]  We've had reports which were carried in the daily news about plain clothed police officers randomly plowing mopeds into giant groups of people.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]  Have you seen any examples of that take place?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]  I just, all I saw was on the news and just probably the same story you've seen, you know.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]  And, you know, basically.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  Anyways, here's Alex. It was great talking to you guys.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]  All right, thanks a lot, guys.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]  We've got to reload our cameras.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]  Andrew should not have to reload them.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]  We just ran out of tape.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]  Erskine, I don't want to monopolize here.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]  Do you want me to let you go and let Harry and Paul and you continue?
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000]  There isn't any monopoly because this is a report that no one is getting anywhere else on American news.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]  It is simply not getting out.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000]  You are breaking a story that other people aren't getting unless they watch C-SPAN.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]  Well, let me pose this question to Harry Brown and Paul Watson.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000]  In America, is it proper that we are on major city streets, not even around secure facilities,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]  and people run up and scream, even with press passes, which we shouldn't even have to have,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]  threatening to arrest us for videotaping.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  It's all color of law, and it's just part of this process of people being afraid to even tape.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]  Do you guys have any comments about that?
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000]  Well, while you've been talking, I've been surfing the net here,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]  and CNN has a story on the protesters down on the bottom of another story,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]  and they say that 1700 have been arrested,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]  and they talk about the complaints about the conditions of those prisoners,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000]  but I didn't find anything on the Fox News site, and I find very little on the CBS site,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]  and that's as far as I've gotten so far.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]  Well, it's normally 15 to 2000 at any one time in the camp.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]  They're normally there about 25 hours on average.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]  It's been on the local news.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]  The police have met it, but then I look at the national news.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]  I find almost nothing, and then I talk to people from the union that's been in the newspaper.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]  The building is full of asbestos.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]  The cops don't even want to work in there.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]  Their union's complaining, and it's not even set up to be a jail.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]  They have them just caged up behind barbed wire inside a 70-year-old bus terminal
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]  with literally an inch of grime and oil and chemicals on the ground, Harry.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]  That's Pier 57.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]  Now, question for you, Alex.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]  How many people are there protesting, would you estimate?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]  Well, again, the big combined march was on Sunday, over 300,000.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]  I mean, these were marches five, ten blocks long covering five streets.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]  I mean, it was just ultramassive.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]  Everywhere I drove all over the city, 5,000 here, 10,000 there, 100,000 here, 20,000 there,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]  and then now throughout the week, basically there's just protesters everywhere.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]  Any street you go up, I've been all over the city, people with signs everywhere.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]  You'll shoot with a 10,000 here, 5,000 there, 200 here.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]  It's just everywhere.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]  And the cabinet I've talked to, they say between 50 and 90 percent of people they've talked to,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]  I've got different numbers, hated that the RNC is here.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]  There's troops, guys.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]  Get video of these troops coming.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]  Zoom in on that, guys, right there.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]  Right there, there's troops.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  Get video of them.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]  Go over there, Carlos.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]  Go over and talk to the troops.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]  I mean, it is just blowing me away.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:56.000]  And there's little gaggles of 2 to 20 National Guard just marching around all over the place.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]  Ted, that's good from here.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]  Go ahead and get it from here.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]  Police Day 2004 live from New York City.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]  It is Alex Jones.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]  Paul, do you have a comment or do you want to ask Alex a question?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]  Yeah, have you seen any examples of photographers and journalists being arrested?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]  Because there was an article in the New York Daily News about how filmmakers who were actually
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]  filming a movie about protest, not involved in the protest, were arrested for their own
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]  damage.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]  Alex is going to get back with that right after these words.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]  Filmmakers, are they being arrested right after these words?

[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]  the nightmare U.N. population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]  tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:03.000]  Three thousand delegates, three hundred thousand protestors in a scene that sounds more like
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]  the description of chaos reminiscent of Kirk Russell's escape from New York.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000]  It's Alex Jones live from New York where he is at ground zero.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000]  And the question for Alex from Paul Joseph Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos and we
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]  know what their order is going to be, is are independent film producers, people like
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]  this, are they being hassled?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]  And what I'm gathering from you, Alex, it's like a fisherman just throwing a net out
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]  and gathering whatever they bring in, any kind of fish they can bring in.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]  Is that the way it is, Alex?
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]  Yes, what Paul brought up is totally accurate.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]  They have these fences and they will herd you into a corner and then just arrest everyone.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]  I'm talking 75-year-old women, people in wheelchairs.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]  It's indiscriminate.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]  They grab everybody and put them in paddy wagons.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]  And then I've got these young kids who are actually starting to have trouble.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]  I don't know why, but a police captain, I actually did something and sped on a delegate's car
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]  and nothing happened to me.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]  They arrested everybody and they told me I could go free.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]  I mean, we have our own videotape saying that.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000]  You also have useful idiots out doing bad things and the cops just let them go.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]  And I just had another person walk over to me and go, oh yeah, my family's maybe sealed.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]  They called us on September 10th and said they'll go to the World Trade Center tomorrow.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000]  I mean, it's just every five minutes somebody walks over and tells me a new story like this.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]  Every day I've been out here at Ground Zero.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]  It's just incredible.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]  These are all New Yorkers who just work right around here.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]  And people just sit there screaming at the police telling them they know it's the New World Order.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000]  They know who's behind it.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]  Listen, I'm going to let you guys go and let you have the last word.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]  God bless you.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]  I want to thank Harry Brown, Paul Watson.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]  I want to thank you, Erskine, for coming on.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]  I want to have Harry Brown sit in in the future.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]  I want to have Erskine do it and just God bless you.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]  Take care of yourself.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]  Take care of yourself.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]  Let's go to Harry.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]  Harry, any comments on this?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]  This is awesome.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]  This is absolutely awesome.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]  It is police state.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]  Well, I've been looking at the web, as I said, while you folks have been talking,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000]  and I just don't find any indication in the news that there has been any violence there at all.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]  In fact, there are specific statements that there has been no violence at all
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:20.000]  and some woman with the New York Civil Liberties Union said that she acknowledged that the police had been very gentle.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]  So it's not really getting into the news, that's for sure.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]  It's in the foreign news, Harry.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]  It is in the foreign news.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]  Well, I looked at BBC and I didn't find anything, but that's as far as I got.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  What particular foreign news have you seen?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]  I have seen it on German and I've seen it on Canadian television.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]  Both of them are leading off their news stories with the rioting in New York.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]  Paul, any comments?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000]  Well, yeah, I think there's been a couple of reports here on British television which have stories about it.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]  But the major news line that I've been following is the New York Indian Media news line,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]  which carries up-to-the-minute updates on exactly what's going down,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]  and they were particularly evident on Tuesday night when there was a lot of trouble.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]  So if listeners stay focused on the PrisonPlanet.com website tonight,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:20.000]  as I would expect with Bush giving his speech, if there was any real provocative action that would occur tonight,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]  then people keep tuned into the website.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]  I will provide them with any updates as they come in.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000]  So they've got a train all sitting to get Spirit Bush off of Manhattan
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000]  and out of New York City, all sitting down below a special train.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000]  This is something when our leaders have to go by underground trains and we've got this type of a situation.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]  America is in a state of siege. There's no question about it.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]  We're scared of the world and the world is scared of us.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]  And until we change our foreign policy, that's the way it's going to be.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]  Amen, Harry. You're 100% right.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]  And New World Order is trying to get order out of chaos.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]  This is elite-sponsored terrorism.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000]  Thank you, Paul. Thank you so very much, Harry Brown, for being on Alex Jones' radio program.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]  Thank you.
