[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:11.000 --> 00:23.000]  It's Tuesday, January 15th, 2019, and I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:23.000 --> 00:29.000]  My problem is there's too much news to cover, and I always tend to go down a few rabbit trails
[00:29.000 --> 00:37.000]  and not get a third of it, but today I'm going to try my dead level best to get to almost all of this news.
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  There's a new giant caravan forming in Honduras, funded and run by the UN and George Soros on its way,
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  and Trump has extended the military emergency on the U.S. border now through September,
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  and of course the enemies inside our government are saying it's terrible, it's treason,
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  it's white supremacy, blah blah blah to have a border.
[00:57.000 --> 01:08.000]  They'll be looking at all that. Trump and lawmakers paralyzed over shutdown as both sides remain dug in.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  We're going to be going over all of that. A really important story that illustrates why we can't take this country back.
[01:15.000 --> 01:27.000]  The GOP has thrown Representative King overboard, Steve King, with a out of context quote from the New York Times,
[01:27.000 --> 01:37.000]  who's famous for lying. The New York Times is a criminal, anti-American, vicious lie factory.
[01:37.000 --> 01:46.000]  He's put a letter out. He said that they removed words out of what he said. It's clear what he was saying,
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  and none of the media will even pick it up. Instead, the headlines are,
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  Steve King says he isn't a white supremacist, but he stands by his quote that white supremacists are good.
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.000]  When he's got a public statement out the last day and a statement the day before that saying it's not true,
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.000]  I have experienced the New York Times. They are a ship of devils.
[02:12.000 --> 02:22.000]  But here's the issue. Then the bolster at the New York Times gives a history of his white supremacist attitude.
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  And when you read the quotes, it's, he talks about illegal aliens having double the crime rate.
[02:29.000 --> 02:36.000]  Okay? He says we should be proud of the accomplishments of Western civilization. Absolutely.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  Aren't the Chinese proud of themselves? Aren't the Japanese proud of themselves?
[02:43.000 --> 02:50.000]  It's just, it's just a rosetta stone into everything, how they lie, how they manipulate,
[02:50.000 --> 03:03.000]  and how the weak need chicken-necked Republicans desperate to curry favor with the left and race-based leftist constituents
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  through an overboard. You know, we have Sarah Jong saying she can't wait till whites are bred out,
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  that whites are horrible subhuman creatures that live in holes like goblins, these are quotes,
[03:16.000 --> 03:24.000]  and that she loves being mean to white people. Now she's on the board of the New York Times and they stand by that.
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  I mean, the media projects like whites are these evil people. Everybody wants to get into white nations
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  because the truth is on average we're very, very nice because of Christian society.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  That's what helped phase out the barbarism that was everywhere else.
[03:39.000 --> 03:47.000]  And Christianity comes out of the Middle East and it's adopted in Europe. My God, in China they just let you starve to death on the side of the street.
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.000]  But see, we've got to, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, you've got brown skin, can I bow down to you when you call me subhuman?
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  But then the same criminal organization, I mean it's a criminal organization, takes clearly.
[04:01.000 --> 04:07.000]  We're saying white supremacists, you know, Nazis, all this stuff, you know, they're comparing it to Western civilization.
[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  That's the quote. And the New York Times removes that out and just says, you know, has King up there saying that,
[04:15.000 --> 04:23.000]  and it's out of context when we all know his talking points. So it's incredible dumb effing white people making up the internet,
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  I mean, she is a vicious anti-white piranha.
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  We've aired the clips. They show kids at school teaching Asian kids to hate white people and hate white men.
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  We've played those clips. I mean, this is the savage beyond white supremacist level.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  It goes beyond white supremacist and some of their most barbarous quotes.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  The minorities under let this control and take it to new foaming at the mouth hatred.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  Just absolutely wanting to murder white people.
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000]  That's why we've introduced the Info Wars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[06:15.000 --> 06:21.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:26.000 --> 06:33.000]  Austin, Texas. Transmitting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[06:33.000 --> 06:40.000]  There are several stories here in my stack that are absolutely key to understanding what we're facing
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  and what we have to do to take this country and the world back for everybody.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  No matter what color you are, where you came from or what your religion is.
[06:47.000 --> 06:56.000]  But if people won't sign on to the Renaissance and Western civilization and Christianity, basic ethos,
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  everywhere else will sink into barbarism and collapse. It's just a fact.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  This whole Steve King situation, watching the Cowardly Republicans throw him overboard
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  via a fake news story out of the New York Times is truly disgusting,
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  but we're going to be covering this in detail at the start of the next segment.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  I'm going to go through every angle of it because it's bigger than Steve King.
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.000]  It's the anatomy of how the New York Times deceives, how they twist,
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  and then once they put out one big lie and define someone as something,
[07:32.000 --> 07:41.000]  they then attach the false thing to real things they've said, thus defining saying that illegal aliens
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  have doubled the crime rate of the average citizen. That's an FBI's own numbers.
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  That becomes the white supremacist statement.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  And then out of that, they've set the new precedent to have the Republicans grovel and fear
[07:54.000 --> 08:01.000]  and throw them under the bus and go virtue signal because Senator Mitt Romney, the neocon, leftist,
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  led the way. After all, he created the model of Obamacare to rip everybody off.
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000]  Isn't he a great guy? Thank you, Mittens Romney.
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  So I'm going to cover that at the start of the next segment.
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.000]  Then it's a very sad article, but you know, I show you vaccine inserts and I show you all the statistics
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  and the millions that have been paid out, secret funds out of the vaccine damage system set up in 1984
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  that is classified but part of its public. People won't care about that.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  As Stalin said, one man dying is a tragedy, a million dying is a statistic.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  Well, former UFC fighter Morn's son who died for vaccine injections.
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  And it's always the same story.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  And it's all part of the chemical lobotomy we give our boys.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  But when they have a bad reaction, the side effect is death as in grim reaper.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  And again, there are two people in this building.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  I know whose children died from vaccines and they admitted it.
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  And just every day I see someone else's child that dies.
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.000]  And, you know, they just they're running around happy. Get the third round and it's bye bye, Bluebird.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  So we're going to be looking at that.
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  Then we're going to also continue to get into the war on men.
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  We'll get to the latest on what's happening with China, with the government shut down a bunch of Trump tweets.
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  And we have a whole bunch of guests that are listed up at info wars.com in the show area.
[09:33.000 --> 09:40.000]  But we have Raheem Kasama coming on Dan Lyman and Paul Joseph Watson.
[09:40.000 --> 09:47.000]  And also want to try to open the phones up some today to get your take on the shutdown and Trump and the economy and where all this is going.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  And another big caravan is on its way.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  Now, you know, I know how to translate their lives.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  This is hundreds of Hondurans.
[09:57.000 --> 10:04.000]  That's what ABC News, News Trust, AP, hundreds of Hondurans set off towards the United States and New Caravan.
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  And so when you go look up the actual photos in those countries, it's thousands.
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  Just like they said that the tens of thousands that ripped down the gates in Mexico and all the rest of it were were hundreds.
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.000]  And they'll find a little corner group of a couple of women, always a close shot of a woman with a child and say, oh, this is all there is.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  This is the non-existent threat.
[10:24.000 --> 10:33.000]  You pull back the camera and it's 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, all UN funded.
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  So that's how this works.
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  And that's how the globalists get this job done.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  And they know there's free welfare, everything else up here.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  And so they're on the way, but they're smart.
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  They get the paycheck on average and get the welfare.
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  So that's the trick that the illegal aliens engage in.
[10:53.000 --> 11:00.000]  And there's just endless, endless hours of armed men climbing into the United States, smuggling drugs.
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.000]  And we have video of the left bringing them food and water to the drug cartels.
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  And a lot of the leftists are now being hired to be drug mules.
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  Yes, it's so wonderful.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  All because they went and saw a machete funded by the federal government.
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.000]  That turned out where Don Johnson's wearing a cowboy hat, shooting Hispanic pregnant women in the stomach.
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.000]  And then like little birds imprinting the leftist watch all that and believe it.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  And then they go to the border and help smuggle people in.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  And the coyotes say, thank you.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  We only rape 80% of the women that come through here and kill people and cut their heads off and have drugs.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  But you're such a dumbass gringo.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  How about you help carry this package to my mama?
[11:49.000 --> 11:55.000]  And a lot of them end up being drug mules and they're so stupid they don't even know they're carrying drugs.
[11:55.000 --> 12:03.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, leftist virtue signaling to coyotes who per capita are the most murderous,
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  rape driven group of criminals the planet has ever seen since the telethon.
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  But Don Johnson shot a pregnant Mexican in the stomach in a fantasy world.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  But don't worry, machete killed him, cut their heads off.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  Machete doesn't go help Mexican women and Honduran women being raped.
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  He kills gringos.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  And Robert Rodriguez is a, he fits the part of flaming anti-white, super racist.
[12:29.000 --> 12:36.000]  Some people that know him just has cussing fits at what he was raised by white people that took terror and funded him and all that.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  And dates white women.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  But just a, but see, Nazi ideology is fun.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  But see, Hispanics can be Nazi, whites can be Nazi, blacks can be Nazi.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  And you go around most of the world, if you don't look like them, they're going to kill you.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  If you're black and you show up, say, in Tajikistan, you're dead.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  If you're a white woman, you show up in Tajikistan or a Christian, your, your head's getting chopped off,
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  but not before you get gang raped.
[13:02.000 --> 13:11.000]  And then if you're in Tajikistan and you show up and say, Nigeria and you're a Muslim, they're going to kill you.
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  K.I. double hockey sticks dead.
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  You go down to somewhere in Mexico, start waving American flag around at a soccer game and booing their team.
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  You're going to get knifed 100% or you get your head bashed in.
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  And the police are going to laugh at you when you're getting put in the ambulance if you're still alive.
[13:32.000 --> 13:40.000]  But that's, but oh here, you have, Steve King says we should be proud of Western culture and not have it under attack.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  And that illegals are double the number of crime rate.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  That's the white supremacism.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  It's coming up next segment.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  I'm going to stop right there and just put a call out to the listeners.
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.000]  I want to thank the listeners.
[13:55.000 --> 14:02.000]  If you hadn't been funding us, there are all these attacks and all the censorship and the attempts to shut us down and all the fake lawsuits and everything.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  We wouldn't be here.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  But because of you in the last couple of years that have been hell, we're still here.
[14:07.000 --> 14:14.000]  And last year was a good year in many ways because nationalism and patriotism is coming back into bloom and it's spreading.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  But for those of us at the tip of the spear, it's hard.
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  Please remember that you have info wars in this operation of my crew in your hands.
[14:23.000 --> 14:32.000]  And when you do simple things like get high quality concentrated, fluoride free, to loyal silver iodine four to five tooth paste.

[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  We secured that source.

[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  And we have the last round of supermail, superfumile vitality, cold press because it's so hard to get the wildcrafted herbs.

[18:05.000 --> 18:17.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.000 --> 18:26.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.000 --> 18:37.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.000 --> 18:51.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.000 --> 18:59.000]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:59.000 --> 19:08.000]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.000]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  But thanks to SupermailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[19:19.000 --> 19:30.000]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[19:30.000 --> 19:40.000]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[19:40.000 --> 19:48.000]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SupermailVitality before it's gone. This is actually our last run of SupermailVitality.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  So I want you to experience SupermailVitality before it's too late.
[19:53.000 --> 20:11.000]  Unleash the Supermail in you with SupermailVitality at InfowarsStore.com.
[20:23.000 --> 20:39.000]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and the globalists want me off the air because I pierce into how they construct their lives.
[20:39.000 --> 20:46.000]  Mainstream corporate Decepticon media knows that we're awake.
[20:46.000 --> 20:54.000]  It knows that we can go dissect single lives easily, and we know they're a pack of liars.
[20:54.000 --> 20:59.000]  They've been national polls where mainstream media has 7% approval rating.
[20:59.000 --> 21:05.000]  So it's the most hated group in the world. All over the world, people know that corporate media lies.
[21:05.000 --> 21:19.000]  But they construct whole universes, whole false realities, like Times Square bombarding you with the disinfo, and there they're able to deceive.
[21:19.000 --> 21:32.000]  And the Republican Party's cowardice, but also the fact that a lot of Republicans are playing ball with the establishment,
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  that is what allows this to continue on.
[21:36.000 --> 21:48.000]  So what's happened to Congressman Steve King, who's had a lot of courage to defend this nation against globalist Hollywood and chai-com demoralization,
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  and who has helped quarterback Trump's message.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  That's the one thing the corporate media got right.
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  He has been targeted as I have been targeted and others have been targeted for destruction.
[22:00.000 --> 22:09.000]  And so the leader of the minority in the House and others have really rolled over to the disinformation in a big way.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  So right now, this is so illustrative. This is such an important segment.
[22:13.000 --> 22:20.000]  We're live on air. We'll post it later to infowords.com. Get this out to everyone, you know, because this is damning information.
[22:20.000 --> 22:31.000]  Remember Sarah Young, she's on the board at the New York Times, got on there last year. She helps coordinate taking conservatives off the Internet.
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  That's admitted. Project Veritas got that on video.
[22:33.000 --> 22:41.000]  She says she can't wait till whites are bred out, that whites are horrible, that whites are dogs, that whites are goblin creatures that live in holes,
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  that she loves being mean to white people.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  The New York Times said we back it and we think it's a good thing.
[22:47.000 --> 23:00.000]  Okay, then this same criminal group run by Mexican narcotics money, you name it, on record, the enemy of the people, the enemy of America,
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  the enemy of sovereignty, they put out a fake quote interview.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  And I've had the New York Times do this to me.
[23:07.000 --> 23:13.000]  Headline, Alex Jones threatened to use quote, battle rifles on the media.
[23:13.000 --> 23:19.000]  I said, battle rifles had nothing to do with the media. I said, if Antifa comes to your house to try to kill you, you should have your battle rifle ready.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  That turns into kill the media had nothing to do with it.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  Total deception.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  So King puts a statement out.
[23:28.000 --> 23:37.000]  He says, clearly, I didn't say that I have prepared remarks about how Western civilization being proud of it is not white supremacy.
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  And that we should be proud of it.
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.000]  The New York Times is a criminal group.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  They've done this to me and everyone else.
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  They are a lie factory.
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  They remove the word there out of the quote.
[23:51.000 --> 23:57.000]  Now they're removing it and cutting it even down more to one word and two words.
[23:57.000 --> 24:05.000]  Peter King said quotes around it, white supremacist quotes around it, white nationalist.
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.000]  So now they're even cutting it down to two words, not wanting you to have the context of anything.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  That is pure evil.
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  But the Republican leadership,
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.000]  they want to virtue signal.
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.000]  So here it is, GOP Senator, Representative King's white supremacy remarks hurt the nation.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Well, that's old Mitt Romney getting some good points.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  The best Democrat the Republicans have.
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.000]  House GOP leaders removed Steve King from committee assignments.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  Now here's where they really get into it.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  A history of Steve King's racist remarks.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  So see, they don't have a real quote.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  We have his real statement.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  He should sue the New York Times.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  I'm certainly thinking about it myself.
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  They've done this to me and I've got them on tape.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  But it's the Republican cowardice.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  And here's where they do the alchemy, watch this closely.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  He didn't say white supremacy is a good thing and he endorses it.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  He said it's not the same as Western culture and being proud of it.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  But then they quote real things he said.
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.000]  Now that they've said this is white supremacy and now they start teaching you illegal aliens are breaking the law to get here.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  They have doubled the crime rate of the average citizen.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  And now you're, oh, that's white supremacy too.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  See how they do it?
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  That's how they create one line, get everybody to accept it and then attach it to 100 others,
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  but then direct it at real quotes and then define those as that.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  So let's read these evil quotes.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  There's like five pages of them. Listen to this.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  Breathlessly at a rally in Las Vegas,
[25:48.000 --> 25:55.000]  Mr. King calls the deaths of Americans at the hands of undocumented immigrants a slow-motion holocaust, which it is.
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  200,000 dead Mexicans alone.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  He claims that 25 Americans died daily because of undocumented immigrants.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  That's a very low number.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  An unsupported and ideological leap, there's no link to their proof,
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  from government statistics, which years later influenced talking points for President Trump.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  That's the racism. Oh my gosh.
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  On the House floor, Mr. King demonstrated a model for a 12-foot concrete border wall
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  topped with electrified wire that he designed.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  Oh my gosh.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  They got electric barbed wire around rich people's houses.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  We need to do a few other things.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  Oh my gosh, it's so evil.
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  Preventing babies being born is not medicine.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  That's not construction to our culture and our civilization.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  If we let our birthrate go down below the replacement rate, we're a dying civilization.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  Yes, Europe, here, everywhere, Japan, 1.2, 1.3 replacement rate.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  Saying it's okay for white people to continue to exist. That's not racist.
[26:54.000 --> 27:03.000]  But according to the hateful, anti-white, vicious, chai-com funded, demoralized America corporate media, it is.
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  Because the Chinese are totally ethnocentric, completely maximum racist in the nation itself
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  compared to anybody else on the planet.
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.000]  And they know that Western civilization threatens their hegemony and their funding through Hollywood on record.
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  All these movies were whites existing as bad and expanding on that.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  Where there's race war in America and division between men and women.
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  And how you teach your kid how to be gay or be transgendered.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  They execute you for that in China.
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  But China owns six of the eight big production houses and they demand.
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  That is a talking point on record.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  You're a foreign enemy.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  If you teach people that men being masculine is bad and have Gillette ads saying,
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  don't have masculine men, turns out that's the agreement we now learn.
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  Procter and Gamble just got allowed into China a month ago.
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  Oh!
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  The chai-coms mean, Bidness.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  And then it continues on here, ladies and gentlemen, with other quotes.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  Other evil racist quotes.
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.000]  He's the chief sponsor of a law making English the official language of Iowa.
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  He said we should respect America's greatness and that it's been by Christianity,
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  free enterprise, capitalism and western civilization.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  So these are real things he said that are good things.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  We're out of time.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  We come back.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  I'm going to finish up here with his actual statement.
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  But then when you see the news, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN,
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  even Republicans are like, he wouldn't walk back saying white supremacy is good.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  Even though he never said it, the New York Times just took the word there out.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  You can see it.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  And then they continue to put it out there.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  Well, you know, he's still defending the fact that he's white supremacist
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  and they won't show you what he really said.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  That's what they do when they assassinate your character.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  They lie about you, you cowards that join in with it.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  So they won't be next.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  Unbelievable scum.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.000]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  and using prescription drugs.
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.000]  After my second EWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.000]  Get sober now. Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.

[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4store.com.

[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  Slap those green and wood until the crystal packed.
[33:38.000 --> 33:43.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[33:43.000 --> 33:57.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:57.000 --> 34:08.000]  I am particularly outraged right now, but more importantly, if we don't get educated about how the criminal mainstream media works with fake news
[34:08.000 --> 34:16.000]  and allow them to continue to pick off one nationalist after one patriot, after one Christian, after one free market supporter,
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  then this nation will be taken down by the fascist left.
[34:20.000 --> 34:28.000]  Representative Steve King has been at the heart of educating President Trump about what's happening and how to fight back
[34:28.000 --> 34:35.000]  and how there's a war against Western civilization funded by communist China, the EU, and of course Hollywood.
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.000]  And it's all over the news now that having a nation's bad, that America's bad, that America was never great, it'll never be great.
[34:43.000 --> 34:49.000]  That's the outrage. So he's talking to the evil New York Times, who's famous for misquoting people and lying,
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  who has on their board many, many racists, not just a particular lady saying that she can't wait until all the whites die
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  and there's subhuman dogs and goblins that live in holes. We'll talk about her in a moment.
[35:00.000 --> 35:08.000]  This very group known for all its fake quotes, misquoted an interview he did out of context, where he's saying white supremism,
[35:08.000 --> 35:18.000]  white nationalism, all that, they're not the same as Western culture being proud of the West.
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  And that's what these crooks do, is they lie. And I know you know that, but the other big part of the equation is
[35:24.000 --> 35:32.000]  the Republican Party jumping into virtue's signal, if they keep doing this and don't stand up to known liars,
[35:32.000 --> 35:39.000]  who I've had the New York Times do this to me, saying that Alex Jones says, kill the media with battle rifles.
[35:39.000 --> 35:46.000]  And it's battle rifle with quotes around it. And a totally different discussion. Nothing to do with the media.
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.000]  I said, advantage becomes your house to kill you. But let's give him the benefit of actually hearing from him.
[35:52.000 --> 36:01.000]  Here is his statement. And none of the media is picking it up. They're still saying he stands by his statement.
[36:01.000 --> 36:07.000]  No, he doesn't. But see, he's even too timid. He should follow lawsuit on the New York Times post case, call his office.
[36:07.000 --> 36:14.000]  He needs to do it. This is defamation of character to do harm. It is the very definition of defamation.
[36:14.000 --> 36:25.000]  King's statement regarding Leader McCarthy's decision. Leader McCarthy's decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth.
[36:25.000 --> 36:31.000]  The truth is as follows. One of my quotes in the New York Times story has been completely mischaracterized.
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  Here's the context I believe accurate reflects my statement, which is the same talking points he always puts out.
[36:36.000 --> 36:45.000]  In a 56 minute interview, we discussed the changing use of language in political discourse. We discussed the worn out label racist.
[36:45.000 --> 37:05.000]  And my observation that other slanderous labels have been increasingly assigned to conservatives by the left who injected into their current political dialogue such terms as Nazi, fascist, white nationalist, white supremacists, western civilization.
[37:05.000 --> 37:18.000]  How did that language become offensive? Now, he's saying, dash, western civilization. How did that? He's talking about western civilization.
[37:18.000 --> 37:30.000]  But see, they know the New York Times, the average person's illiterate now and doesn't know when you say Nazis, fascists, white nationals, white supremacists, western civilization.
[37:30.000 --> 37:39.000]  How did that language become offensive? That means that last piece connected to the ones before. Any idiot can get that?
[37:39.000 --> 37:51.000]  Was it the best words? No, but it doesn't matter. The point is, is that he said what it means. Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and civilization?
[37:51.000 --> 38:00.000]  Just to watch western civilization become a derogatory term in political discourse today, clearly. I was only representing western civilization classes.
[38:00.000 --> 38:07.000]  That's what he's talking about in the whole. No one ever sat in a class listening to the merits of white nationalism and white supremacists.
[38:07.000 --> 38:17.000]  So it's a larger interview about merits of American history and American exceptionalism and America being founded on Christianity so you know where you came from and the Renaissance.
[38:17.000 --> 38:27.000]  And he's saying in the context of the interview, but they didn't put any of that in there. They just have him saying out of context that thing they can trick you.
[38:27.000 --> 38:37.000]  This is how sick these people are. So again, just to watch western civilization become a derogatory term in political discourse today, clearly.
[38:37.000 --> 38:47.000]  He's only referencing western civilization classes. No one ever sat in a class listening to the merits of white nationalism and white supremacy.
[38:47.000 --> 38:57.000]  When I use that word, that it was in reference only to western civilization and not to any previously stated evil ideology, all of which I have denounced.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  My record as a vocal advocate for western civilization is nearly as full as my record in defense of freedom of speech.
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  At this point, I am told you have to do what you have to do and I will do what I have to do.
[39:09.000 --> 39:19.000]  I will continue to point out the truth and work with all the vigor that I have to represent the fourth district of Iowans for at least the next two years.
[39:19.000 --> 39:28.000]  And that's how they try to bring you down just like they have tried to do with me with Jones bullied and child endangered.
[39:28.000 --> 39:35.000]  The YouTube ultimately took me down for it. They don't show what I said, what I did. They just said child endangerment.
[39:35.000 --> 39:46.000]  And they show a man who looks like he's about 5'4", I'm 5'11", with a beard, pushing a child down that was on ABC News, CBS News, everywhere,
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  for like a year by the time I played it for another reason, where the kids punched and they got over and over again.
[39:51.000 --> 39:57.000]  So he finally pushes the kid down in another state. No one ever said it was me. I'm clear on the video, it's not me.
[39:57.000 --> 40:03.000]  I said, look at how these thug kids push and push and push until somebody does something. And they said, you know, we'll just take it down,
[40:03.000 --> 40:13.000]  say child endangerment and leave it at that. You understand when they censor you, they lie about you, remove you, and then they can do to you whatever they want.
[40:13.000 --> 40:22.000]  The only way I get the truth out is you taking this live feed and sharing it via text message, via email, via person to person, word of mouth.
[40:22.000 --> 40:30.000]  The only way representative Steve King, a good, decent, honorable Christian man, very wholesome, I've watched his speeches many times,
[40:30.000 --> 40:42.000]  I've read his writings, just right in line with mine, just good, wholesome Americana, just basic civics that have been taught up until the last 30 years.
[40:42.000 --> 40:49.000]  Now you got to go to a Christian private school to get an American classic education, and they now turn that into white supremacy by misquoting it,
[40:49.000 --> 40:57.000]  and now connecting it to, remember them saying Trump giving his speeches?
[40:57.000 --> 41:03.000]  Saying it's okay to be a nationalist, it's okay to love your country, it's okay. They go, oh my gosh, it's a dirty word.
[41:03.000 --> 41:11.000]  Now nationalist is going to be white supremacist. This is how they define things in an age where you have illiterate people who were never taught in school.
[41:11.000 --> 41:21.000]  Now they're going to get their false education, you see, where free market, capitalism, family, masculinity becomes a dirty word,
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  and this is what they're doing is undermining our entire civilization and attacking everyone.
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.000]  You know, if whites were so bad, everyone wouldn't be trying to get into white Christian nations.
[41:32.000 --> 41:41.000]  But then the left creates a existential envy curve and tries to tell people that come here, you are hated by white supremacists who are everywhere,
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  even though we can't find them, but we're going to take care of you, and we're going to make a happy place for you,
[41:46.000 --> 41:55.000]  and you're really being brought in by the Democratic Party model of the great society that was meant to capture and enslave black people,
[41:55.000 --> 42:05.000]  and now it's being deployed against everybody, and that's a fact, Jack. That's not my opinion. That's the reality of what's going on.
[42:05.000 --> 42:12.000]  And they even call his pro-life statements racist. That's some good alchemy there.
[42:12.000 --> 42:18.000]  So the globalists know the West has a guilt Christian ethos. That's good. It keeps us from killing each other and makes us nice.
[42:18.000 --> 42:26.000]  But it's being overused against us now to have everybody stand down and have this guilt where we're all taught to have this guilt,
[42:26.000 --> 42:34.000]  and then minorities are turned into foaming at the mouth racist against white people right as they become the majority.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  It's truly sickening.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  We'll come back and get into what's targeting every one of us, no matter what color we are.
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  This can really save lives, and it's a heartbreaking story, but it's important, so please stay with us.
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  But whatever you do, listening on local radio, watching on the TV, or watching at infowars.com,

[43:18.000 --> 43:24.000]  The first seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it,
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.000]  so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[43:30.000 --> 43:38.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[43:38.000 --> 43:48.000]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[43:56.000 --> 44:08.000]  This is X3, now available at infowarslife.com.

[46:01.000 --> 46:07.000]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[46:17.000 --> 46:25.000]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN Agenda 21.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[46:41.000 --> 46:48.000]  They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  It's The David Knight Show.
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  I've never missed your show, any day.
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  I mean, never.
[46:56.000 --> 47:12.000]  EditFords.com.
[47:27.000 --> 47:37.000]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big Tech
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.000]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election.
[47:43.000 --> 47:49.000]  And the Big Tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner,
[47:49.000 --> 47:57.000]  who's running this whole thing, to begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[47:57.000 --> 48:04.000]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you cannot violate people's free speech.
[48:04.000 --> 48:09.000]  Mr. Jones, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.000]  This afternoon's hearing is...
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  Sure, yeah, but every time they have these meetings, they bring up info wars.
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  They claim they're taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  Obama established with an executive order.
[48:20.000 --> 48:26.000]  He established with an executive order before he left office, a special office that deals with foreign propaganda.
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  What it's really been used is to target domestic, populist, popular groups.
[48:31.000 --> 48:37.000]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people,
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[48:41.000 --> 48:48.000]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  To date.
[48:49.000 --> 48:59.000]  Just like Communist China, this is dangerous authoritarianism, and they packaged silencing Americans who are popular and well-spoken as Tucker Carlson said about me on Fox News,
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  not because what I say is bad, but because what I say is effective and true and popular.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  But I think the corporate dying dinosaur media has been off more than it could chew,
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.000]  and what you've done is only going to make people be that much stronger and fight for free speech that much more.
[49:12.000 --> 49:19.000]  But I'll say this, shame on the mainstream corporate media, shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment,
[49:19.000 --> 49:43.000]  but instead a tap dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working with big tech.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:45.000 --> 49:53.000]  We have the former head editor of Breitbart UK, who's incredibly smart joining us to get into the real invasion that's happening there.
[49:53.000 --> 50:01.000]  And then we have Dan Lyman, who's there in Paris for the whole yellow vest situation where they don't have armed troops with lead bullets saying they're going to start killing people.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  So France is going to the highest level of martial law under EU dictatorship.
[50:06.000 --> 50:14.000]  But the good news is all over the world, nation states are pulling out, particularly Brazil, where they've got a guy even more well-spoken than Trump.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  And he comes off as even more authentic.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  We're going to be playing those clips next hour, yes.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  Yes, I'm blown away by what's happening in Brazil.
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  This is the real McCoy right here.
[50:25.000 --> 50:30.000]  And just like George Washington, he was a colonel and all the rest of it.
[50:30.000 --> 50:40.000]  Now, Stalin said one person dies, it's a tragedy, a million die, it's a statistic.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  And I've learned that's true.
[50:42.000 --> 50:53.000]  And I want to explain something. Every time we talk about the dangers of vaccines, corporate media either ignores it or they say, oh, look, these diseases are spreading because of non-vaxxers.
[50:53.000 --> 51:00.000]  In almost every case is the people taking the vaccines that are getting sick with the supposed thing the vaccines are taking care of.
[51:00.000 --> 51:08.000]  I know all about immunization going back to cows and humans at smallpox hundreds and hundreds of years ago, 600 years ago in Europe.
[51:08.000 --> 51:14.000]  I believe in the technology of getting artificial immunity.
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.000]  I know it can work and work like magic.
[51:19.000 --> 51:30.000]  I also know about tens of thousands of declassified secret government tests over the years where people were injected with all sorts of deadly pathogens,
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  our military, poor white people, poor black people.
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.000]  There was always somebody that the government controlled, it was compartmentalized groups doing it. Radiation tested on people, you name it.
[51:39.000 --> 51:46.000]  The media has the golden globes saying everybody's getting flu shots and it wasn't even really happening.
[51:46.000 --> 51:59.000]  So, people tend to ignore all that, but the facts are if you read the inserts of any vaccine, it'll tell you it can cause neurological disorders or death, it can cause cancer,
[51:59.000 --> 52:04.000]  and particularly in small children.
[52:04.000 --> 52:13.000]  Everybody knows if an 18 month old toddler got stung by some bees, even one bee, sometimes they have an autoimmune response and die.
[52:13.000 --> 52:20.000]  Well, just the autoimmune response, imagine taking your baby in for well checks and usually by the third round they give them six, seven shots
[52:20.000 --> 52:28.000]  and a lot of times kids don't talk for a few days, they have convulsions or they die. Blood comes out of their nose, I mean you name it.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  And they admit all that.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  But then they'll have in the newspaper every year before school starts or whatever, oh it's safe and effective, maybe your arm will get sore.
[52:37.000 --> 52:43.000]  But every day we see people dying from the Gardasil shots or the MMR shots or others.
[52:43.000 --> 52:51.000]  But here was another one that tore my guts out when I read it yesterday and I didn't get to it on air because it's so painful I tend to shy away from this stuff because I have four children.
[52:51.000 --> 53:01.000]  And I can't tell you how many times I've been at a resort, it's always on vacation or at the mall or something, and I see an autistic child, it's almost always a boy,
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  87%, 86% are boys.
[53:04.000 --> 53:10.000]  And I'll say to the family while I'm waiting for my wife to buy shoes or something, oh tell me what happened to your son who's five, six years old.
[53:10.000 --> 53:19.000]  Well, we think it was the shots, he was 18, he didn't wake up for 18 months, he didn't wake up for two days after he got the shots.
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  Or they say, yeah, he had a convulsion right there in the doctor's office.
[53:23.000 --> 53:34.000]  Now the doctors have got to cover their butt and the health department has meetings with them and says, we know this is going to hurt a certain number of people, but overall it's a greater good, so lie to him and say it's not the vaccines.
[53:34.000 --> 53:45.000]  I ran into the head of the Texas vaccine whole operation for the state, had a debate with him on the green belt years ago and he's like, well it's for the greater good, but we do cover it up.
[53:45.000 --> 53:54.000]  And I said, but it's not for the greater good, because it allows these companies to get away with what they're doing and the covert operations of things like Tuskegee and Cold Springs Harbor.
[53:54.000 --> 54:05.000]  Now everybody's talking about the discovery of DNA and how he basically says black people aren't humans and all this stuff.
[54:05.000 --> 54:12.000]  He's a big leftist, Cold Springs Harbor is where they did eugenics, this is where they developed the Tuskegee experiment and all this.
[54:12.000 --> 54:21.000]  Who do you think went and wanted to know how the DNA worked and guess whose father worked with Cold Springs Harbor and ran the secret army operation there?
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  Bill Gates is a daddy.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  Yeah.
[54:25.000 --> 54:33.000]  So people might want to go research Bill Gates's statements that sound just like Watson's.
[54:33.000 --> 54:38.000]  Oh, but Bill Gates tells you how much he loves the little black children.
[54:38.000 --> 54:44.000]  So former UFC fighter, more than sons who died after vaccine injection.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  He's spoken out.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  We've reached out to him.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  He hadn't gotten back with us.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  I know he's in a lot of pain, but that's how you're going to save other children.
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.000]  That's what you've got to do for your son.
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  And it's the same story.
[54:54.000 --> 55:02.000]  Take him in 18 month, well checked, give him the shots, goes running, happy, laughing, doesn't talk for a few days, neurological disorder dies.
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  My son should be here, healthy, 20 months old, just don't pass away.
[55:06.000 --> 55:14.000]  UFC fighter Nick Cantone last week mourned his son on the second anniversary of his death following a round of vaccine injections.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  There's heart-rending little videos of this boy.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  In fact, I should have told you guys, grab those videos.
[55:19.000 --> 55:20.000]  I'm going to play some of them.
[55:20.000 --> 55:31.000]  In a Facebook post, Cantone recalled how his 20 month old son Nicholas passed away on January 12, 2017,
[55:31.000 --> 55:39.000]  mere days after visiting a pediatrician for a well visit where he received the MMR and flu vaccine.
[55:39.000 --> 55:47.000]  The next day, January 11th, looking back at our pictures, you were sick and not yourself, writes Cantone.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.000]  Breaks my heart, wish I knew what I know now and we were able to put it all together.
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  I'm so sorry, Nicholas.
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.000]  I just broke down going through these pictures and typing this makes me sick that you are gone.
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  Still can't believe this happened to our family.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  Worst possible thing in the world.
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  It's so hard.
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  I'll never stop fighting for you.
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  I love you more than you could ever imagine, Nicholas.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  Heart broken forever without you.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  I miss you, Nicholas.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  Good night up in heaven.
[56:15.000 --> 56:22.000]  Photos shared show a lively Nicholas sitting on an examination room table full of smiles.
[56:22.000 --> 56:29.000]  While another presumably after vaccines, the next day, features Nicholas with a vacant stare, apparently suffering neurological trauma.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  Subsequently, he died days later.
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  And the subsequent postling to an article regarding vaccines and their alleged ties to autism.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  It's apparent Cantone blamed the vaccines for Sundes.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  Wake up, people.
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.000]  Don't let this happen to you.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  Cantone warns his followers.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  It's disgusting what's going on.
[56:44.000 --> 56:45.000]  So much corruption and lies.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  All they care about is money.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  No, it's served.
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.000]  They are targeting boys.
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  It's designed.
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  86% are boys.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.000]  They are our children.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  We are talking about makes me sick.
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  My son should be here healthy.
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.000]  20 pounds.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  Just don't pass away.
[56:57.000 --> 57:03.000]  Nick, the Jersey Devil Cantone was an active USC for 2017, 2014 and maintained a 10 for record.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  And it goes on.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  Well, let's save more little boys and little girls.
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  Because, you know, there's somebody in this building whose little girl died after vaccines.
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  It gets girls too, but it's designed to hit boys.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  And we even have the documents on that.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  So they got Gillette commercials saying men existing is bad.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  We are under an attack.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  The criminals are desperate that Trump, whose son got damaged, but came back from it.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  Barron may be able to get into all the secret stuff and reverse it.
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  That's why they're fighting like the devil to stop this.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  And that's why we have to get this article in the video we just did live out to everyone.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  I'm counting on you.
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.000]  And this little boy spirit is counting on you before they kill and maim and brain damage millions more.
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  Help the children take action now.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  Defeat the globalist.
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.000]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.000]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:01.000 --> 58:05.000]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:05.000 --> 58:14.000]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  You can override the censors now.
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.000]  And if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[58:24.000 --> 58:28.000]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[58:28.000 --> 58:34.000]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  Call the talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[58:42.000 --> 58:48.000]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[59:12.000 --> 59:28.000]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[59:28.000 --> 59:38.000]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[59:38.000 --> 59:43.000]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[59:43.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  Try Honor Roll from InfowarsLife at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  All right, we have one of the top reporters in the UK, expert on open borders and the whole globalist takeover.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Former head of Breitbart, UK, joining us Raheem Kasam.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  Then Dan Lyman joins us from the middle of the Yellow Vest where they've now got loaded guns with live ammo, lead full metal jacket ammo to start shooting and killing the Yellow Vest.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  That's total maximum martial law.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  That's all coming up next segment.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  But whatever you do that last segment about all the kids dying from vaccines and the proof of it, get that video out and save lives.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  But here's a breakdown, disturbing deep state takeover rapidly approaching.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  Be honest with the public about how we're under UN globalist attack.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  They're teaching us that having a nation even existing is evil and is bad.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  Shocking. It is. We have a president who calls himself a nationalist, nationalist, a loaded word for a lot of people.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  Obama with the NATO cons, with large sections of US intelligence, Defense Department, all of it. This is all public.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  Set up a total internet kill switch system that is manned by at least 100,000 people right now with heads up displays on your phone, on your computer, live time and all new devices.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Microsoft, Apple, Google, the idea that Apple says what happens on your phone stays on your phone. That is the biggest joke on the planet.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  It's already been beta tested and in three months it rolls out on the new Microsoft everything where they're in your phone live time and they put like the fact checking you see on Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  When I had Buzz Aldrin on and they just put a fact check up saying, Jones says no one wants the moon, but it's Wikipedia Britannica says we did.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  The damn interview says we want the moon.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  Buzz Aldrin, magnificent desolation.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  Two people from the planet Earth walking around on that object that humans had gazed up and looked at for all of civilization.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  So that was a magnificent testimonial to the progress that this human intelligence species was able to do.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  See how that's fake news, lying about me but superimposed. It will not be on the site you go to now that opts in.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  It will be over all devices, intelligence agencies including Interpol, the reactivated Stasi in Germany.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  Google's moving into the former Stasi headquarters in three months.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Microsoft and then Apple and then Google all of them by the middle of 2019 are implementing live access into your phone where they will see where you're going and what you're doing in live time.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  We already know they've been tracking us doing that.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  But now they're going to have a consortium of neocon organizations, hardcore Soros backed organizations, specially selected by Obama and Hillary before they left office, groups in every US intelligence agency, all 17.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  Coordinating political minders that don't just spy on you, that send live time messages over what you're browsing on the internet.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  So it isn't like you go to somewhere on Facebook and there's an Alex Jones video and then it puts up a link from Snopes saying this is fake.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  Or from the Southern Property Law Center or from the ADL or from Media Matters.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Literally Soros when you go to a site breaking in and putting it over, it's going to be on your device.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  Now we've already seen this happen in Fort Worth where they didn't just delist us off of iTunes six months ago.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  We had links just to our own podcast and in the iPhone browser, they blocked you on an iPhone being able through that function on the phone to get to it.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  You understand you go buy a phone and the next level is you can't go to infowars.com.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  You can't click on it.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  You can't listen and they've now got keyword and they've got audio, which is the next level where then they won't even let you listen to my voice.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  It's automatically blocked.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  Now listen to me carefully.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  This is for everybody.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  This is going to totally vertically integrate the entire world.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  The Wall Street Journal, again a month and a half before we got purged, said when we're done with Jones as the test case, we're going to take everyone off and you will maybe have a thousand channels.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  Please, whatever you do realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  Yes, some of them are like little side accounts.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  They even know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I beat a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  I want to keep going.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  I want to push all the way.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  I've committed to do that.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've got to back us and I promise you this.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  I will never falter.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  I physically will.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  But I give you my commitment if you financially support us at InfoWarsShore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  If you look at the model of what's happening in Europe and how the globalist forces have destabilized North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  and how they are now collapsing the borders and funding the Arab Spring and removing moderate Islamic leaders and others and secular leaders
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  and putting the most rabid groups in, it's clearly a destabilization program.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  And then when you read the writings of Peter Sutherland who died last year and others, they say that's the plan.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  Why would Macron say last year, we need 200 million Africans in the next 30 years, that the center of France is Africa?
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  And then the words we hear that even say a nation state exists is a bad thing.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  In my view, and in their own statements, it's multinational corporations want a bunch of divided and conquered people, kind of like the British Empire did,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  where they could use a few thousand troops and suppress India for hundreds of years using divide and conquer.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  But there's so many facets to this as Europe awakens the yellow vests, as you see nationals getting elected in Brazil, other areas.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  And you see the accelerating cover-ups of not just Islamic-based groups committing crimes, but other groups like Irish Gypsies and others.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  They're allowed to steal people's Winnebago's, their RV's.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  I guess in Europe they call them, they had different names for them.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  But there's really not anybody out there who's been closer to this from every angle than Harim Qassam.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  And he, of course, has done a great job at Breitbart for many, many years as their main editor over there.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  And he's a political activist, former editor-in-chief Breitbart London, former chief advisor at UK Independence Party Nigel Farage.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  Right now he's in a transition period.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  He's the author of the book No Go Zones, How Sharia Law is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  Now remember, just a few years ago they'd laugh at Raheem when he said that in the news.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  He'd go on BBC and they'd say it doesn't exist.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  Now it's all over Swedish news, German news, Dutch news.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  There's whole area, huge areas you can't even go into where plumbers won't even go.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  So thank you for joining us for most of the hour.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  And I think the best place to start here is to just let you get your legs, because I've seen you on TV, they always try to interrupt you.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  To talk about your awakening, your background, and then how you got involved in politics.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  And now everything you warned of is okay, yesterday's news.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  So tell us what's coming next. Thanks for joining us.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  No, I appreciate it.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  The situation that we have at the moment in the United Kingdom, as you probably know, is that in the next hour or so we have this vote on Brexit.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  And I'm following that very closely.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  You mentioned me being in a transition period.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  You know, I've worked for the last six or seven years between the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, Breitbart, London, so on and so forth.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  And we really had our fingers on all these pulses for some time, whether it was mass migration, radical Islam, the spread of globalism, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  And your introduction there resonated with me because 2016 was a real shock to the system for these guys.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  And they're now going, instead of saying, okay, well, we've realized that people don't like this and the anti-globalist politicians are becoming elected all over the world,
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  whether it's Brazil or Hungary or the Czech Republic or India, so on and so forth.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  Instead, they're doubling down.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  And as they're going to do to your web browsers and so on and so forth, their solution to this is to try and put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  Is to say the internet has awakened too many people and we've got to now stop that process.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Now, for me, you talk about the transition period where I am right now is trying to build a couple of different institutions, news media organizations,
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  and almost like a think tank sort of organization that looks at how this stuff is taking place, what mechanisms they use, whether it's infrastructure,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  whether it's like Visa, Mastercard, that kind of infrastructure, the financial underpinnings to the way that the globalists entirely manage the system.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  So that's what I'm doing in 2019.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  The reason for that is because I don't mean to be mean about this, but when you hear the sort of mainstream conservative commentators throw their hands up and say,
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  well, you know, they're private companies, Microsoft are private companies, so it can put whatever it wants on your laptop and stop you reading whatever they want you to stop reading.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  That's up to them and it's up to us as consumers to buy something else.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  The problem is at every level, whether it's in your face on your browser or whether it's the financial payment system or whether even it's the energy infrastructure that's the underpinning of all of that,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  they'll take down all of those things step by step to make sure that we don't get our hands on the real news and so on and so forth.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  So that's the sort of thing we're working on at the moment.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  The reason that Brexit and the next hour is so important to that, as I mentioned at the beginning, is because Theresa May herself, the Prime Minister in the United Kingdom,
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  is trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube of the largest ever democratic mandate that we've seen in the United Kingdom on the 23rd of June, 2016.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Her proposition that we have this sort of semi or associate EU membership looks like it's going to lose a House of Commons vote,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  and therefore naturally the thing to do is would be to proceed with a no deal scenario, which is that we just revert to World Trade Organization rules with the European Union,
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  our trade deals with the European Union, but that's not even good enough for the globalists to have a globalist entity like the WTO isn't good enough for the globalists.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  They can't afford for the European Union to be destabilized.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  Well, sure. Now they want an EU army to stop Italy from stopping Soros-funded votes bringing in thousands a day, as you were saying.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  And I should have introduced that up front. You're there in London. Perfect report on Theresa May facing a no confidence vote.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  I mean, I was getting into the big picture, but that is pretty big picture and happening now. History right now.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  I mean, at least there's going to be a vote there. Then we'll talk about why is France so paralyzed to not obviously remove Macron?
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  Yeah, that's absolutely right. And you're seeing also not just with France and Macron, but the Yellow Vest protesters in the United Kingdom,
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  which actually hasn't been picked up as much as the French protesters, primarily because they're smaller protests.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  But actually we have now political dissidents in the United Kingdom, people who are being locked up for protesting in favor of Brexit.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  That just happened this past week. You know, an activist by the name of James Goddard has actually been given bail conditions in the United Kingdom,
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  where he's no longer allowed to enter London because he was found to be protesting too vigorously in the cause of Brexit.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  Well, that's the real kicker. As you can have radical Islamic preachers preaching murder, the police blow things up and they're protected.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  But then Michael Savage can't fly into the UK and there's been discussions of banning me and then people inside the UK,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  they're talking about not letting them leave the country extrajudicially or not let them travel around.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  I mean, this is real Nazi Germany type stuff. I mean, that's what Nazis did was give you an ID for folks that don't know that said where you could go.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Yeah, where are your papers? Exactly. And that became, you know, somewhat of a joke amongst Western nations post Second World War.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  But it seems like the lessons haven't been learned.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Britain, I'm afraid, as a Brit, I get very heavy hearted when I say this, but has effectively turned into a police state now.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  And it's a police state only for political dissidents. You know, if you're if you're a machete wielding Islamist nutcase,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  the hammer doesn't come down as hard on you. I mean, you may get a few months' jail time, but you're not getting what these political activists are getting.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  I mean, if they could have, they would have kept Tommy Robinson in prison for 10 years.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  It just so happened that we marched 20,000 patriots down Whitehall several times over the summer that actually scared these people into realizing that we weren't messing around anymore.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  But I'll tell you something else. If after this evening's vote, which Theresa May will lose, she opts to go down another route, keeping us tied somehow to the European Union.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  You're going to see 40,000 or 60,000 or 100,000 patriots marching down Whitehall demanding a real change.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  Man, we've got to get you on more often. It's been really hard to get you on. I know you're a busy guy, but we would love to have you on.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  We would love to. We're trying to like work with Paul Watson and other reporters to go out just independently and cover this stuff because the public is hungry for this.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  And Tommy and others are arrested for exposing child grooming pedophile gangs that he exposed 12 years ago.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  I was to cover it and then I get demonized and lied about and he platformed people like, well, and then now it's everybody. I mean, it's just everyone I know is being censored.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Everybody I know on every platform, people are, I think there's going to be a backlash to it.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Yeah. And when I interviewed James Goddard last week after he was first kicked around by the police in Westminster, they took down my Facebook account within 10 seconds of me announcing that I was about to interview him.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  Incredible. Stay right there. That's right. They tell you, if you talk to an unperson person, you become unperson. That's the tyranny chain reaction. Raheem Kasam, stay with us.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars One and Two left England broken.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War One.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Machine Qassam, as I told you, is probably the most articulate, smartest guy on the globalist Islamic funded invasion, but also just on the corruption in Europe and what's happening.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  And everybody who's known about my show for a long time knows that I know about geopolitics and I've said a lot of different angles and I'm more of a libertarian.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  But I was against the wars in the Middle East because I saw us taking out regimes that were not the bad ones. I mean, that was part of an older Eisenhower plan to put pro-western people in.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  And it took, you know, 19 years after Eisenhower left, but we put Saddam Hussein in.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  And they modernized women in college, taken the veils off, and Playboy magazine being sold the stores. I'm not saying that's even a good thing. I'm a Christian, but that's people's freedom. And then he got set up later by Neocons and taken down.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  He attacked Iran like he was told to. That was part of an older US policy, running into a new US policy. So I have leftist guilt, not as a leftist, I get the guilt of bombing people and murdering them.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  I don't blame our military. They were ordered in there. Plus, there are radicals in there. But then that creates the dialectic of the cosmology now of funding an era of spring to put the very worst people in, overthrow our allies, and then have the left and corporate media and everybody promote the most virulent forms of Islam.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  I mean, if there were Christian groups, you know, running around, throwing people off buildings and slaughtering folks and blowing things up, I'd say that needs to be reformed.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  So I don't want to say I swung back too far the other way. I used to be so trying to stop this clash of civilizations that the Neocons were pushing for that I didn't even understand what that meant was they weren't just talking about a clash of civilizations for war.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  They actually meant to use Orthodox radicalized Islam to take us down and take them down. Kind of like in the old James Bond movie. What is it from Russia with love? Maybe we'll find the clip later where you got the two Chinese fighting fish.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  That's really the Machiavellian plan. And our guest has been reporting on this. Raheem Kasam on Twitter for now. Again, he just left Breitbart incredible work.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  Again, I'm not even getting into a certain subject here. I'm just quantifying the censorship, the control you were getting into at the break and where this authoritarianism is going and the fact that there's a larger global corporate plan.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  They admit for what's supposed to come out of this on the other side, but we haven't really gotten the documents on what the other side is. We just got the documents on this plan.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  Right. And every so often the mask slips, especially in the last couple of months, you've seen the mask slip a couple of times, both in the United States and in Europe, Germany specifically, as it pertains to the mass illegal immigration problem that both of these continents have.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  The corporates come out every so often, as I say, the mask slips and they say, yeah, but then where are we going to get this, this cheap labor that we need in order to prop up our massive profit lines and our profit margins.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  And it's sort of becoming unavoidable for them where it's a good thing that we've done. What we've done is we've forced them to own their own nefariousness.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  We forced them out in the open. Exactly. We forced them out in the open.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  Yeah, that's exactly right. And, you know, it's caused the end of magazines like the weekly standard. But again, the lessons don't usually get learned. They tend to try to double down.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  They've now got this new website called the Bullwick, which is literally just a carbon copy of the weekly standard, where they go after people who are either libertarians like yourself or nationalists like me and who actually oppose the globalist totalitarian philosophy.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  And this is this is Bill Crystal and the Pierre Omidyars, the same people who work hand in hand with the John K6, who's now, I think, a CNN contributor as of this morning.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  Oh, yeah, we've seen top leftist embrace famous warmongering neocons that are real criminals. And I'll be clear. I like libertarian philosophy. I'm 100% nationalist, just like you. That's the class.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  Nationalism, self-determination versus corporate fascist globalism.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  Yeah, absolutely. And I think there is there is a very big philosophical hurdle here. And I think we find almost as much common cause with the with the political with the real political left rather than the center left.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  It's why I'm not the I'm not the sort of person who looks at Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and just laughs about her. There are things that she is saying that are obviously true.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  The same with Elizabeth Warren, by the way, her book from I think 2013 hits upon some interesting points and Tucker Carlson mentioned that I think last week as well.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  So there are people out there and there is a there is a coterie and a cadre of people out there who are beginning to see the same things in the same way about totalitarian control.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  Now, I don't like the left solution to any of those things, but it doesn't mean that they can't identify the problem.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  So that's that's I see that happening more and more in the United States today where where the Bernie people, you know, there are a significant number of Bernie people who went over to vote for Trump.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  And I think that'll be the case in the next election as well. And the same thing happening in the Brexit debate as it keeps going on the remain campaign is a lot of the left wing remain campaign is the people who vote to stay in the European Union.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  And now looking at how the EU's treated Britain and are going, well, we didn't realize that they were such like dastardly globalists from the first instance of the 2016 campaign.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  Now we're beginning to see that they don't want to let us out and they will do anything to punish us. I mean, they've actually talked about punishing us.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  Oh, sure. They talked about plunging like a good ally to me.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  They thought about plunging your stock market in the UK to teach you a lesson.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  Well, remember who who who started that in the 90 was George Soros. That was what he did with with Black Friday and how he tanked he tanked the sort of like Wednesday and how he tanked the pound and made billions upon billions as a result of it.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  And I'll tell you something, Alex, you asked me in the first segment, you know, to tell you a little bit about my history, the reason that I take such umbrage with Soros is because my parents were immigrants from India into the United Kingdom and were entrepreneurs.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  My father owned a chain of fast food restaurants and when that crash happened in the early 90s, he lost everything.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  I mean, we lost our house. We lost our cars. We lost absolutely everything. We lost the businesses. Absolutely everything.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  So when I go back and look at what someone like Soros did to my family, you know, he professes to be pro immigration and all this stuff when he what he did to so many poor families, immigrants or not, by the way, in the early 90s.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  Oh, that's he raids pension funds. He raids companies. He's a cold blooded. I mean, like I'm not a fan of Facebook, but he's trying to take it over.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  So he's been doing a pump and dump for a year. They do nothing compared to Google. And I say Facebook's bad.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  But we only hear about Facebook's bad because Soros is muscling in. This is a guy literally helping hound out and find Jews because he looked younger than he was.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  And then and then I mean, his whole life is just a one giant evil timeline.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Right. And this is this is the person that I think was a time magazine made their person of the year this year without all the financial time.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  Sorry, made their person of the year this year without any, any mention of boy, isn't that pissing in the face of the UK when he almost brought the UK down?
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  Yeah, and it's a UK paper, right? And I actually I won't disclose who it was, but I've had a Financial Times journalist emailing back and forth with me over the last couple of days, literally saying to me in my email box.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  I hope Brexit fails. I hope you get, you know, you don't get what you want after all of this.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  And, you know, these people hold themselves up as independent, you know, reporters.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  I've got the evidence to prove that he's saying what he's saying. But, you know,
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  And let's be clear, they're not just mercenaries against their own country and their own interests. They are enjoying effing themselves.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  Oh, and they they enjoy doing it to us a lot more. Believe me, they take real, real joy.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  They fantasize how they're part of the ruling class. Man, Raheem Qassam, no wonder they want you off the air. You are smart as hell.

[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  If you just tuned in about 20 minutes ago talking to the former chief editor of Breitbart, London, Raheem Kasam, really smart guy, I pointed out and he agreed with the analogy that really Ian Fleming worked for OSS, MI6, was a spy chief, like deputy head of it, so he's a smart guy.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  He was a super villain back in the 70s and 80s, but then he came to the U.S. fully, became a citizen and bought the U.S. off.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  But the reason we raise this is the same thing with Islam and the West, and the PNAC documents of the Class of Civilizations, which the neocons kind of run the Democrats.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  Right now, against Trump and against other nation states, they, when they say clash, they mean bring it all down, the Muslims too.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  So the Muslims need to understand that.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  And of course, you go to India where they estimate 140 million Hindus have been killed by Muslims.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  There's also, and China doesn't like what's happening with radical Muslims, this is the way forward to help reform Islam before it's destroyed.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  So we're doing Islam a favor here.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  This is not just that I want to kill people because they're Muslims.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  I'm not going to be killed.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  I'm not going to accept serial law.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  We'll talk about Raheem Kassan's best-selling book, No Go Zones, How Serial Laws Coming to Neighborhood Near You, Can Europe Survive in a Moment.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  But first, since I mentioned that clip from Russia to Love, the allegory of Machiavelli, you can strategy him.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  Here it is.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  Sami's fighting fish, fascinating creatures, brave but done the whole stupid. Yes, they're stupid. Except for the occasional one such as we have here.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  Let's the other two fight.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  He waits.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  Waits until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  And then, like spectre, he strikes.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  I find the parallel amusing.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  Our organization did not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  Number three.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  Come in, Kronstein. Sit down, number three, while we listen to what number five has devised for us.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  I hope Kronstein's efforts as director of planning will continue to be as successful as his chess.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  They will be, according to your instructions.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  Then they go into how to get to Russia and the U.S. into a war, which is the same story over and over again.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  So now it's Islam in the West.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  You've got to bring in enough Muslims to trigger it.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  So I want to get into my big question I asked you.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  Anything you want to cover, because you probably have better points than I do, but I want to go back to what you mentioned.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  Oh, Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  You know, these are all private companies.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  They do whatever they want.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  They're being advised in congressional and parliamentary hearings in the U.S. and the U.K. and the EU.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  They're being pressured by Merkel to suppress more people.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  They're on hot mics saying, we'll do it.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  Don't worry, aka Zuckerberg.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  And now you've got, because the Southern Poverty Law Center and others have been discredited like Snopes as fact checkers.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  Now it's going to be a consortium called New Shield, where all these groups interface and they admit with U.S. intelligence,
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  but groups Obama set up and Hillary under the countering foreign disinformation propaganda act.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  So a U.S. government consortium agency sub agency will interface with all these other private groups
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  with live plug-ins on all phones and computers starting in three months,
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  monitoring what you do and putting messages up saying, watch out, News Guard is the name.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  New Shield, I'm tele-proper free.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  News Guard, run by Neocons, will now be putting plug-ins in front of everything you do
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  and putting messages up in front of you.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  I mean, this shows that they are very scandalous, Raheem, and they're planning something really big.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  They wouldn't be going with device level control, basically a selective internet kill switch and surveillance system,
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  and letting all these groups into your phone and computer via News Guard front, rubric,
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  unless they were planning to remove Trump and launch something big. What do you think?
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, if they can get it off the ground that fast.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  And this, by the way, has been in the works for several years now.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  These things take time to develop, and specifically they take time to get the level of buy-in from the tech firms,
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  because they don't want to be seen to be actively targeting people, but that is precisely what they're doing.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  So it's a big sort of PR.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  And this gives them a third party. I hate to interrupt.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  This gives them a third party to have plausible deniability.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  It's really run by intelligence agencies, staff by left-leftists. This is incredibly sensational.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  That's what takes a couple of years for them to get to this level.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  But there's a reason that they've been getting here now right ahead of the next presidential election cycle,
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  and right at the time that other nations are considering leaving the European Union.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  We know that France, French political parties are now floating that idea.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  The Italians want to leave the Euro, the Germans, the alternative for Deutschland.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  They even said this week that it may consider campaigning on leaving the European Union, which, for those that follow EU politics,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  is quite a massive step, because these are sort of people who are net beneficiaries of the European Union being in existence.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  They're starting to realize that actually sovereignty and independence is more important than sheer either power or economic benefit
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  and all the things that we've been sold for so long.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  So that's why they're putting this news guard system in place right now. They've realized, again, as I said in an earlier segment,
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  that the toothpaste has to go back in the tube.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  But they also know that there is a massive industry that relies on mindless consumers on Instagram and Twitter and so on and so forth.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  So they don't want to get rid of these platforms altogether because it plays into making us all consumers to a mass degree.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  So they've got to figure out how, at a device level, they can influence us rather than at a sort of a web platform level
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  because they've tried it with Facebook, for instance, and Google, for instance, but people use things to get around that
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  and they're starting to see people waking up to using VPNs or ad blockers and all that stuff to get around it.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  So what's the next step? It's to actually make that thing inside your device to plug it into the hardware of your device.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  And as you say, I think we don't consider this often enough that these are not just private companies.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  They are massively subsidized by governments all around the world. They work hand in hand with governments all around the world.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  And now they're openly saying that they're working with intelligence agencies. This violates the Fourth Amendment.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  So they're going from spying on us and denying it to now having public-private university partnerships to literally rape us, watch us,
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  and tell us what to do. This is like living in a digital prison.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  They are absolutely public-private partnerships and that's the way they need to be treated, not as private organizations.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  And they also act as cartels as well to get what they want.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  I mean, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act effectively means that Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of these guys don't have to have any legal liability
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  for the things they put out there. And they don't also have to project that legal liability on the people that post things that might be criminal.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  They just get away with it all together. I mean, even the New York Times, as much as I don't like them, bless them, don't have to adhere to that level,
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  or don't get that level of, you know...
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Oh, I totally agree, man. You're on target.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  This is just a residency from government.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  Big tech's the new royalty. They can be a publisher but not a publisher, have no liability, control everything they do,
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  spy on everyone and now bring in intelligence agencies, staffed with private leftist groups.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  I mean, that isn't a perfect storm of nightmare. What isn't?
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  Well, and that's exactly what it is. And it's taking us so very long to come to grips with that.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  And also, so very long, you know, I sit here speaking to you from Capitol Hill right now.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  We should have our own army of activists and lobbyists, which is what the other side has,
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  talking about this to lawmakers and we don't.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  You know, the only people that have their big fancy offices on K Street and not the American people, it's the corporate interests.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  And so this is what I'm doing in the next few months is going to be building institutions and organizations that actually do that work that we should be doing.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  It's not just the great work like what you do, Alex, in waking people up.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  We also have to do something once they're awake.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  Wow. Okay. I interrupted my last question and took a segment, but it was really important.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  Let's come back with that question I asked two segments ago.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  What happens to Europe? Can it be saved with the former editor of Breitbart London, which is the smartest editor we've interviewed from there.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  We've interviewed a lot of great ones. Raheem Kasam at Twitter. Raheem Kasam.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  Be sure to follow him there. We'll be right back.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.

[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  X3, now available at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  We have those incredible self-prices back at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  Of course, he's always going to help me all the way.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  Raheem Kasam, former editor of Breitbart London, really smart guy who experienced sorrows,
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  destroying his father's successful chain of businesses in the U.K.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  when he tried to destroy the whole economy back in the 90s.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  He's our guest final segment.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  I'm really impressed with his work already.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  But hearing him here on the air, being able to actually talk,
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  and I'll have, you know, three minutes on some BBC program, he's on target.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  There is a global program by megacorporations to bring down the West,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  because it, up standard of living, it creates an egalitarian up curve that they can't compete with.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  They want to be exploitive and vertically integrate.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  Then they claim they're going to build some Valhalla, some Elysium in the sky.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  And so there's a real project to collapse the West, to have Western failure.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  I don't know how much he wants to get into what he's setting up.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  He's actually here in the U.S. right now, normally from London,
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  about, you know, looking at Western failure and the plan of the globalists to do that.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  So why do you think the globalists want that A?
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  B, can Europe be saved?
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  Can the West be saved?
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  And if it can, what needs to be done to save it?
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  I mean, I think you're going to say yes, but it's going to take drastic action.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  Well, actually, I would, I'm going to go a little Jordan Peterson on you and say,
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  you know, what is Europe?
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  The truth is there isn't a coherent and contiguous Europe anymore.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  There are countries that can be saved and there are countries that are destined for failure now.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  I mean, Sweden, there's no, there's no resurrecting that.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  I actually feel that way, sadly, about the United Kingdom as well.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  But places like Hungary and Italy and Austria and the Czech Republic and Poland.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  Yes, those countries will continue to be strong nation states with their political philosophies
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  grounded in civilizationism, effectively, in the idea of deference to the nation,
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  but freedom for the individual, the things that, you know, your country was founded on.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  And so I think we have to, you know, disavow ourselves of this idea that there is a contiguous Europe.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  Look, they may have an anthem, they may have a flag, but that doesn't make them a legitimate entity.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  What makes it a legitimate entity is the buy-in of the majority of the European people.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  And you're seeing that number decline and decline and decline every year,
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  not least when it comes to the bloc's currency, the euro,
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  which has been an absolute disaster for countries like Italy,
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  a disaster for countries like Greece, and is now becoming a disaster for the European Central Bank itself,
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  because nations like even France, one of the founding members of the European Union,
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  cannot adhere to the European Central Bank's dictates over the French budget,
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  let alone the Italian budget.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  And so people, including the Yellow Vests and, you know, the great Matteo Salvini in Italy, Victor Orban,
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  these guys are all starting to realize there is no real future of Europe.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  There is no future of the European Union.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  There is only the future for independent nation-states.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  So sorry to be a bit sort of convoluted in the reply,
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  but I think it requires a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer to take apart the European Union.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  No, no, I agree with you. I mean, take the new leader of Brazil, take what's happening in Italy.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  Like you said, it's certain areas who have a cultural experience of being enslaved or whatever,
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  they understand they're fighting back.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  Other areas have some weird suicidal tendency to them.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  But just as we thought France would be the last or Germany, the last country to stay under the EU,
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  maybe it'll be the next one to actually get out of it.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  And I don't think we know here, but I agree.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  This is a wild, wild roller coaster we're on.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  What do you think of Bolsonaro?
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  Look, I have the same sort of reservations as a lot of people have with regards how much
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  Bolsonaro may end up militarizing his government, but at the same time, he makes all the right noises.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  I mean, his speeches and tweets about cultural Marxism, I mean, he's identifying the problem very well.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  It's whether or not his solutions can be solutions as we know them to be classically liberal, right?
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  Libertarian-orientated solutions.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  No, I totally agree. We don't want to turn into Pinotchet and helicopter rides,
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  but at a certain point, if you're Venezuela, a thousand are dying a week for years of starving,
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  but they pass a law, you can't say it.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  They're dogs and cats five years ago. Everything's collapsing.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  When you're already in martial law and hell on earth, sometimes only an emergency ends the emergency.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  And I'm not, I'm Mr. Anti-Police State, but when the left brings you into a hell,
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  then how do you get out of that? It's kind of like Thomas Jefferson said,
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  we will not be projected to the liberty, you know, total liberty and freedom on a bed of feathers.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  And extremism and defense of liberty is no vice and moderation.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  In the pursuit of justice, no virtue, as Barry Goldwell said, I completely agree.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  And I keep trying to impart this to my fellow citizens of the United Kingdom now as well,
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  is that there cannot be for the globalist establishment no consequences to their actions.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  That doesn't mean that we're calling for authoritarianism or violence.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  It just means that, you know, the action will provoke an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  And as yet, we haven't, as I'm speaking as a Brit now,
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  we haven't shown that the political establishment in the United Kingdom,
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  that we're necessarily willing to do that.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  The yellow vests in France are showing the French government that they are willing to show consequences for Emmanuel Macron's...
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  They're showing that Newtonian physics does exist in politics, and it should.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  This is a two-way street.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you know, fair enough, when I get criticized for saying things like that,
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  they say to me, well, what can we do, Rahim? You know, we gave up all of our guns in 1997 anyway,
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  and most of the British public, including the people on the bike...
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  Two people, hang up flyers, stand up, speak out.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  I mean, the power of speech is incredible.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  March on the Palace of Westminster, march on Buckingham Palace, march on Ten Downing Street.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  You know, turn up in your 50,000s, your 100,000s, in your 500,000s.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  You know, we had a million people march against the Iraq war when that began,
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  but for some reason we can't get those numbers out again in pursuit of the ultimate political, you know, philosophy or objective,
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  which is sovereignty.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  You know, the basic thing about whether or not we are a self-governing nation
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  and whether the power is in the hands of the public, we can't motivate people for some reason along those lines.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  Now, we did it, as you can see over my shoulder, in 2016.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  We voted to take our country back that way.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  But we're not able right now, for some reason, to show the political establishment, there are...
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  And I don't say there are consequences.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  I say there are not no consequences for their bad behavior.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  You know, we are now, not to get too sort of in the weeds about this,
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  because I realize I'm talking to an American audience,
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  but the reason that Brexit isn't happening right now is because we have a tyranny of parliament.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  Parliament thinks it is the sovereign in the country, whereas in reality...
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  Sure, they got rid of one queen and brought in a whole bunch of queens.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  Precisely. That's exactly right, and I'm going to steal that from you as well.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  Because, you know, parliament thinks that it has sovereignty over the people,
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  and it also thinks that the monarch is no longer part of our constitution,
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  and the monarch is part of our constitution.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  She has the right to dissolve our government if she believes the government is not acting in the interest of the country.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  And I think it's time for the queen to use that veto.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  She's used it in Canada before. Why hasn't she used it here yet?
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  Exactly. I think it is time for that to happen, and if it's not time for that to happen,
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  then we have to consider why we have a monarchy anymore at all.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  You know, I'm very envious of the United States and its great constitution,
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  and maybe we need a codified constitution like that.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  No, I agree. That would be better, but people don't get the elegance of that
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  under the parliament acts and all the rest.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  The queen or the king becomes a rare trump card to dissolve something
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  if it's totally out of control, and the monarchy wants to risk itself doing that.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  So the monarchy, if it doesn't exercise power occasionally, does become basically vestigial,
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  and this would be the perfect time for them to do that.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  And I know the queen is against the EU and knows it's a Nazi creation.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  Listen, I'm already impressed with you. I'm really impressed with your time today, sir.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  Again, at Twitter, Raheem Kossam, we really appreciate you.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  Please join us on a routine basis. I know you're doing some very exciting things.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  So God bless you, and have a great week coming up.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  That's one of the best interviews we've had in years.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  I mean, I already knew he was smart, but I got smart because it's good like mine, though.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  He knows what I'm saying. He knows I'm making stuff up.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  Well, that's the thing. The globalists want to misrepresent what I say all day,
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  because in the parlance of government and agencies and think tanks, I've done my homework,
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  and that guy's done his.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  So it's not like we're following each other's talking points.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  We're looking at the same damn thing from different perspectives,
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  but he gives me angles. I give him angles, and we're in this together, folks.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  The globalists are evil.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  Now, I cut him off, even though I can talk to him for 10 hours,
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  because I never plugged like once an hour.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  And if I don't start plugging, we're not going to be here.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  I don't want to raise alarms or do 24-hour broadcasts, but that's going to be needed.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  I do the calculating around here, which isn't any marketing at all.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  We sold stuff so cheap during Christmas that we didn't make enough money.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  And so I'm asking listeners, get a t-shirt, get a book, get a video.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  The supplements are the best. Bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  95% are humanoid. Go look what turmeric does.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  Go look what our ultimate bone broth does.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  You know, they sell it for $10 at Whole Foods.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  The equivalent of one quarter scoop of ours.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  Our entire thing's like 30 bucks.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  It's the equivalent of hundreds and hundreds of dosages that Whole Foods sells
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  for hundreds of times the price.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Infowarsstore.com, get in there.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  Just like our Infos game changing, everything we cover is game changing.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Yeah, they take little scoops of bone broth, put it in mason jars.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  It isn't even as good as ours and sell it for 10 bucks.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  You get like 100 dosages for $29.95 at Infowarsstore.com, and it is amazing.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  But the competitors call it, you know, life potion.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  I just call it super healthy.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  We'll be back with the third hour.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year,
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  as you can possibly get.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be,
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  we're changing the world.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield InfowarsLive.com.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  Call it, talk, radio, c-span, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:51.000]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.000]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:11.000]  which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs,
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  which by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  I have sure better stop from the beginning.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  Bercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  For now, the government has the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  I have to work the dark side while I spend time in the shadows.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  Well, join me, and I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  There's a need for new world order, someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  We are watching the rebellions against the globalists very, very closely in the Brazilian immoral dial in Italy
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  and the United Kingdom here in America in Australia.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  They are quietly, for at least five years, taking their government back in many ways.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  And we watch that with a very, very pleased eye, to say the least.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  The battle is joined, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  And we have Dan Lyman, one of the great reporters here, recruited by the great kid Daniels.
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  He's been doing a great job over in Europe, living in Switzerland.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  And he called me a couple of days ago, and he said, do you want me to go cover the 11th, 12th week, whatever it is, of the Yellow Vests?
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  And I said, yeah.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  Obviously he calls.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  That means I've got to fund it.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  And then I kind of felt bad this morning when I got up.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  I read an article at NewsWars.com and EuropeWars.com where they were saying that the police have a live full metal jacket, rifles, cartridges, rounds, ready to kill people.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  And he already saw women and men have their eyes blown out with rubber bullets.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  So I'm telling Dan Lyman.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  One sad part about our shadow band and our outright band is we have a huge audience here when you spread the word and you come here and realize you get it unfiltered here.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  I mean, no one else even covered it because it was so powerful.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  Nancy Pelosi's house and illegal aliens being hired to go there and build a tent city on her property.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  They got picked up here and there, but it exclusively happened here.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  Well, you sit there and you see the footage Dan Lyman got of armored vehicles ramming into people and burning cities and people being shot and women's eyes blown out.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  And I was sitting there watching it the day it happened, part of it live, but watching previous ones saying, I can't believe our reporter, one guy, EuropeWars.com, is writing all these articles.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  He's there shooting all this footage.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  He's showing women's eyes blown out, men's eyes blown out, and we've got Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all banning videos as soon as we upload them, calling us fake news.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  So it's up to you folks when Dan Lyman goes in there for this big showdown the next few days to pray for him because he's volunteering for it.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  A little birdie word he told me, I might be going into Europe very soon.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  There's a lot going on, but we need your prayers and we need funding to go into this operation.
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  Music
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  Dan Lyman is an amazing patriot.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  He's an American living in Switzerland with his wife.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000]  He's lived in Reykjavik. He's lived all over Europe.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:06.000]  And he heads up europewars.com. He's got a few people who work with him sometimes, but usually he's a one-man wrecking crew.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000]  Europewars.com.
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  And that URL doesn't get censored like infowars.com on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  Though the New York Times and others have taken interest and they go, we found a secret website that Jones is running trying to get around us.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  Actually, we set it up before the banning. We just wanted a site for all the Europe news.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  But then they went, but don't worry, we banned Europewars on YouTube and Newswars on YouTube.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  I didn't even know those sites existed.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  So now the idea is, private users, they're trying to say, can't even go up there and do their own reports or talk about what we're doing.
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000]  Because that's how scared they are of us.
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  But they can't stop you, the listener, who I keep going back to because you're everything, to text message.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  People they found look at text messages and links on text messages that gets around the censors more than any other thing.
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:11.000]  You know, word of mouth is powerful. But yeah, you share an infowars.com article on Facebook or Twitter.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  You're going to get suspended for a day or whatever.
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  Do it from Newswars. Do it from Europewars.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  Other sites that are picking our news up.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  You can always put our URL in, see the article you think is powerful, copy the headline to find somebody else, put it out.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  You'll get massive shares.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  I don't care about the advertising revenue.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  I just care about beating the globalists and getting enough money in here to be able to take it to the enemy.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  And thanks to you, you've been doing that.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  But they've announced in three months, Newsguard, run by staybehind groups in the CIA, FBI, and I say staybehind groups, they even say everything I told you.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  And I'm reading this.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  And I'm happy to read this last week when the producer pointed it out to me.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  Newsguard, I'd heard about it.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  Run by the neocons and run by the staybehind groups that Obama funded before he left the Defense Authorization Act two years ago to literally spy on all your phones and computers live time and then block what you can do and control what you could do.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  That means they're planning something big.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  This goes into a plug-in on Microsoft, Apple, Google, Android, everything in three months.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  In three months, it goes in.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  This is beyond the Chinese dragonfly with Google.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  This is beyond the social network.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  This is device level surveillance and control.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  And you just heard the incredibly smart former editor of Breitbart London, Raheem Kossam saying everything I'm saying, because it's in there.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  This is so bold.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  So we'll talk about censorship and what's coming with Dan Lyman first, and then that guilty moment I had.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  He called me a few days ago and he said, hey, boss, you want to fund me to go?
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  You cover week 11, 12 of the Yellow Vests in Paris.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  And I said, yeah, if you're willing to get hurt, man, you already saw people's eyes blown out, and then he agreed to go.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  And then he's videotaped the people's eyes blown out, the armored vehicles.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  All the stuff we've shown you just now if you're watching on TV, radio listeners, infowords.com.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  But now he's going when they've announced the French police to intimidate everybody.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  We've got guns with full metal jacket.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  Wow.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  Don't take it.
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  That'll become the Kent State or the FIFA Vendetta.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  So we don't want Dan Lyman to be that martyr.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  But I think people think of the French as the wimpiest people, but that's because they were in most of the wars up until World War II.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  And they learned to finally give up.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  I'm not saying that's good, but this is this is quite a time bomb.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  We're sitting on top of people can follow Dan on his Twitter as well.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  And again, that's at Citizen Analyst Dan Lyman.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  That's where you're going to see these incredible live videos and also on our platform.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  So Dan, there's your intro.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  Incredible US agencies working against Trump and America announcing a plan to control at the device level what you do and put links over what you do, breaking into your phone.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  Incredible.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  Or the fact that you're going into a literal war zone in France for all intents and purposes is under martial law.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  Good to be back with you, Alex.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  Yeah, the first one you mentioned, I mean, it's just crazy, the censorship that is being rolled out now.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  And as we saw with that video that was broadcast in Seattle, the president's address, we can't even necessarily trust live video broadcasts anymore.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  So don't trust anything you read.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  Don't take it at face value, I guess at this point.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  And you can't even trust live video broadcasts because they're editing them in real time.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  So we are living in 1984 was child's play compared to what we're living now at this point.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  And you're not just saying that.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  But a bold move like that, they're just trying to hide this in plain view, this news guard stuff where the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL Media Matters, they admit through a neocon group have gotten all the tech giants to agree starting in three months.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  They're in your phone watching what you're watching with updates and then and giving you pre program messages, but also live messages.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  So you're going to send your wife a link and some a hole from the Southern Poverty Law Center is going to be watching you.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  And these people are insane, but maybe we'll roll over.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  Maybe they're not.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  Maybe they're geniuses.
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  Yeah, I don't consider myself an overly paranoid person, but I do think twice now about everything that I send on the phone, things that I say around the phone, just because, you know, at this point, we know there's somebody listening always, whether it's, you know, it's probably an AI.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  But, you know, there have been times when I've gone on, let's say to Facebook on my phone after mentioning a product and I'll get an advertisement for that product right away. And that's just like a, you know, microcosm of what's going on at the at the greater level.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  Oh, yeah, they admit lifetime AI scans the text of everything you said, then it analyzes it puts it in an algorithm and pushes ads.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  Right, absolutely. You know, I just had a thing where I was trying to log into Twitter and it was asking me to supply the phone number to Twitter that I used and I couldn't remember for the life of me what it was when I signed up maybe eight or nine years ago.
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  And then when I went to check in the settings on my phone, it had already updated my European phone number into Twitter for me. I did not input that myself. So they're just like scraping your information and then just uploading it for you to everything that it feels like it's becoming your memory.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  It's making your brain vestigial.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  Yeah, it's pretty crazy. Definitely a little unsettling for sure. And I think everyone definitely needs to be careful about the products that they put in their house like these, these new Facebook tablets whatnot that are kind of watching you at all times.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  I'd be very, you know, careful as to what you bring into the home.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  It's, you know, it's crazy that Google's little doorbell system. I forget the name. We can pull it up.
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  And yeah, there's also Google has it. Facebook has it. Amazon has it. This is called ring. That's Amazon's. It's been caught just like smart meters were dialing in not just grabbing that feed or letting people into it.
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  But just it's grabbing everything. Well, of course it is. The gods don't give us Promethean fire without a back door. And I just can't believe like that. It's this crazy.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  It sure is. It's pretty unbelievable. So, uh, I mean, it all, it all remains to be seen as to where it goes from here, but definitely dark times ahead.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  All right, we're going to go to break. Give me the form and come back. What you've seen in Europe, what you're predicting is coming next, but I'm going to just do this for the listeners and viewers right now.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  Dan Lyman's awesome. He is covered Davos. He's covered Bilderberg. He's covered everything and always made history, been on drugs so many times.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  And we barely have enough money to get him into the cities that he's to go and he's ready. We've had a basic salary. He lives, you know, he paid a lot more than his other job, but he does it.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  We want to hire a couple of people to help him. And I'm telling you, we'll do it. We'll buildEuropeWars.com, but we have to have your help.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  And I felt pretty good in Christmas because we had big specials and sold a lot of stuff, but I sold stuff so cheap that, uh, let's just say we're going to have some 24 hour broadcast coming up to raise some money because I need to expand.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  I don't need to stay the same size or contract. If you're not expanding or contracting, there is no equilibrium here.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  So we need everybody to go to infowarsstore.com with big specials that are about to end, 50% off X3 bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  And of course, ladies and gentlemen, supermail vitality is selling out. Our best seller, but we can't get the raw, uh, what do they call it? Wild Harvest at Herbs anymore, at least for now.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  So it's discontinued. Get it today at infowarsstore.com and get your Alexander Cortez as a dirty, globalist dog shirt as well.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  A doctor's office visit for erectile dysfunction on my smartphone? That's crazy.

[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  We have not been covering the new Attorney General hearings. It is a bunch of mummies, a bunch of crypt keepers, basically engaged in what I think they call in popular nomenclature a circle jerk.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:49.000]  So, man, you want to know what the problem is in America? You watch those hearings other than like Ted Cruz and a few people. It is. It is sick.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:59.000]  Here's a few of the new articles up on Infowars.com. Washington Post fact checker, burgers not stacked a mile high as Trump claimed.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  They'll take a joke term the President uses and then say there were not burgers stacked a mile high. That's right. If he has like, you know, stacks of burgers for a big event about to happen.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:19.000]  He goes, look at this, burgers stacked a mile high. Actually, they're only stacked two feet. So they're now taking figure of speeches, figure of speech.
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  Burgers served at the White House could not have possibly been stacked to reach a mile high, as President Trump claimed in a depth Washington Post investigation has revealed.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  You know, Dan, I want to go back into Europe and what's happening there. But this happened last week when CBS fact checkers after Trump's speech about the open border and being a crisis.
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  They said, you know, Trump says one third of women traveling up from Latin America get raped fact checking him. It's 80%.
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:22:02.000]  And they pulled it. They pulled it because they were like, oh my God, it's worse than he's saying. But the point is, is that he got some justice department number that was much lower by some leftist.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:10.000]  So he says one third of women are raped. No, it's 80%. We fact checked him. Meanwhile, he's having a White House dinner and it looks like there's lunch.
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  It looks like there's probably thousands of hamburgers. I mean, every tray has got like 2030 hamburgers on it. There's all this giant table of hamburgers.
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:27.000]  And he says it's stacked mile high and they go, oh my God, he lied. If you stacked them, they wouldn't be a mile high. They'd be 800 feet tall.
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  I mean, this war on everything Trump says is getting insane.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  Yeah. And I don't know if you've spoken about this earlier in the broadcast, but Trump paid for all of that out of pocket himself due to the fact that the lot of the White House staff is furloughed.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  So he ponied up for that and to make sure that the boys got something good to eat. And you know, they all enjoyed it. It's a bunch of college dudes.
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  They're not going to turn down a spread like that. A lot of them said it was the best buffet they'd ever seen. Some of the guys were joking how they took some home for later.
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:04.000]  And personally, I'm not a fast food eater at all. I don't know the last time I've had any, but that was making my mouth water. I thought it was a really cool gesture.
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:14.000]  And, you know, it was fun. It was playful. And those guys will never forget that. And neither will the rest of us because it was just so entertaining to watch even the little bit of video that you're rolling right there.
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  It was really, really entertaining.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:26.000]  Together, it's great to see because we need border security. We have to have it. We have to have it. No doubt about it. Should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago.
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  There's the juxtaposed of golden candle stakeholders with candles and then all this fast food. It's a Trump is ridiculous. He's the ultimate Joker card.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:45.000]  But meanwhile, he says, we've got burgers stacked the mile high. They spin it that he's lying when it's a figure of speech.
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:56.000]  And I didn't see anybody complaining when Barack Obama was spending $65,000 on hot dog dinners. Nobody nobody cared to mention that in the mainstream press or ridicule him.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:05.000]  And Obama always made a big deal of going out for fast food or the press did at least when he did Trump likes tacos and Obama likes likes winners.
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:17.000]  And it has been said that Trump does eat a lot of fast food, especially now at this point because of the low risk of having his food contaminated, which, you know, I don't think any of us can really accept.
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:25.000]  That's why he does it. He will send trusted people out to different restaurants every time to get his food.
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  Yes, I mean, for me, he's probably been I'm not making a big story, but a couple of times I'm pretty sure public events. I got poisoned. And then once I got tested, it was arsenic.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  So I was like 20 years ago, they hit me with some. And so there's a revelation, folks. Yeah, I've been in a war. They must be trying to poison that.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  Oh, they only tried to poison kings throughout history and every culture. But I'm sure the president, no one's trying to poison him. Right, Dan?
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:25:00.000]  No, certainly not. But, you know, I thought it was a great gesture last night and it was fun. And I enjoy these moments that the president, I'm sure he came up with that himself.
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  I'm going to give him credit for that one. That seemed like a Trump move.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  By the way, remember Breitbart? He was going to expose this big thing about the Clintons. I want to get man count on. He said he come on two weeks ago. And that was the last guy he talked to. He said, oh, I've got it. It's horrible. They're going to be brought down. He's caught, found filming at the mouth dead.
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  Then the main coroner doing it says, oh, no, it's arsenic or it's poison. He dies of arsenic poisoning.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  Right, exactly. Trump cannot be too careful. And so, I mean, it's just, it's amazing that he can't do anything right. The media will not allow anything to slide. And, you know, the media, as Mike Sertovich actually pointed out, he has spent some time at the White House with the media.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  And he said there are a bunch of slobs and they have a soda machine in the break room and they all eat garbage all the time. So for them to think that they can, to ridicule this gesture is just the hypocrisy is off the charts.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  I don't want to give away a Trump trick because they know the trick that's going on. He doesn't just send them out for fast food randomly. He picks the place so they can't poison it.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  He also does stuff like even when he's at Mar-a-Lago, he doesn't want to like send it to the wrong person and poison him. So they'll have a fake order that goes somewhere.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  Okay. And then that order is then brought to him. And then another order for him is taken and then it's removed and then the next food's brought over. Imagine having to live like that.
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  That's heavy duty. I don't know how he does this day in and day out, but this has to be one of the most heroic physical, mental and spiritual efforts in the history of mankind at this point.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  Well, that's how he saw it four years ago when he agreed to do this. He went to Scotland for like four or five months and wasn't going to do it. He said, you know, I can't do it.
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  His wife said, you know, they're always saying that his wife Melania doesn't want to do it. She was the final straw. She said, you got it. He said, well, it's a full commitment.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  And he sees it as basically fatalistic and then he's going to give everything he's got to it and be as positive as possible. And he believes in America.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  And that's why when you see it fail, you realize he's failing. And it's a very sick feeling to see people not finally see a real president trying to do what's right for them.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  And a lot of folks get up and a lot of people don't.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  Yeah, he gets up every day and some days it seems like he doesn't sleep at all. It's amazing the stamina that he's shown at this age.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:26.000]  He's been doing this now for, I guess, over three years at this point, day in and day out. The effort is incredible.
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  I was having a conversation with kind of a normie friend of mine recently and, you know, he wanted to pick my brain about Trump.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  But in his opinion, which is what he wasn't off that far off the beaten path, he said, you know, once you get to the Trump level of wealth, the next thing you want is power.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  And that's why he ran for president. I said, absolutely not. That's where you're wrong because you want to be a champion and a hero and dismantle power for the people.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  That's the ultimate brass ring. And if you can do that, then you go to the next level that Trump understands that dismantling this parasitics.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  I mean, how would you define it?
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  Well, I would say that Trump knew how terrible it was going to be going in because he knew the positions that he was going to take were going to be very unpopular with the globalists.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  And now, you know, all the knives have been out for him for years now. And frankly, I'm amazed that he's still around and with us because I was about to say they want to wear us out.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  The longer he survives, even though he's stumbling and bleeding, it just it makes him more and more scared there.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  So you realize the inroads we've made all the planet just while he did this.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  And while our listeners do with us, because everybody gets worn out. Everybody's like, this is only supposed to happen during elections.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  Let this in for a while. No, this is the long haul now. This is the long race, the long swim, the long hike, the long climb.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  This is for all the marbles, baby. This is the decision where humanity is going. Trump's going to win. We're going to win.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  You watch, he may die in the process, but he's a winner. Trump equals fighter. Trump equals victory. Info wars equals victory.

[02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  Live, Raw and Unfiltered by Globalist Propaganda. It's the Alex Jones Show, tomorrow's news today.
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  I am the terror of the tyrants. I am the person willing to die for liberty.
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  I am the blood of the resistance. But I am nothing but my father's, father's, father's son.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  True to my shelf and my family, an instinct not to be a slave, simply a man.
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:08.000]  And they must remove us from the equation because in the hour of the traitor, there can be no simple men
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  who stand for their country, who stand for justice, who stand for their children's decency.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  We must be removed in this great time of evil.
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:26.000]  But make no mistake, my friends, as we see this great corruption expanding and its whole confidence came
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  and its teeth coming out and its censorship and its attacks and its control,
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  it's the end of a cycle of decadence and the end of this system.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  And that's why they're making their move right now. They're scared.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com, let's get now into where you're going in the next few days,
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  the Yellow Vests, the latest 10, 12, 11, what are we, 12 weeks in, what's happening, how epic this is,
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  and how could we ever imagine that France, sold out to the Germans in World War II, stood down.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  That's in the history books, it's not on the news.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  Bought off by the Nazis, the French didn't even fight, they stood down.
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  The French people fought back later, but their generals bought off, setting up an annex government in Vichy, France.
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  The British Expeditionary Force, driven into the sea.
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  Suddenly, you'd never think of France as the place to resist, but see, it's the place the globalists press the hardest.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  So, give us your report on what's happening in Europe and where you think these are going,
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  and what you're about to be covering live in the next few days at EuropeWars.com.
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  Yes, sir, we're going into week 10 of the Gilles Jean, the Yellow Vests protests.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  I'll be on the ground in Paris this weekend on Saturday.
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  Saturdays are when it all goes down, this will be the 10th week of this happening, and as I said,
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  and it does seem that the level of force being used by police against the protesters is definitely escalating.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  I've been monitoring a lot of the videos that have been coming out every week, and this past weekend,
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  there was definitely the most carnage that I had seen, and some new tactics being employed,
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  including these new weapons that they're using, that they call the flashballs,
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  and these are basically 38 to 40 millimeter non-lethal rounds that are fired from little mini,
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  they're basically like little cannons, and a lot of the officers are carrying these around,
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  and when they strike people, technically they're not supposed to kill them,
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  but there is an old man apparently in a coma after being struck in the back of the head as he was running from police.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  There are people who are losing teeth, there are people who are losing eyes,
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  there are people whose one guy lost a hand a few weeks ago,
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  so these non-lethal tactics that they're using are borderline lethal if they catch you the right way.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  I will be going in this weekend with a lot more knowledge than I did a few weeks ago
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:54.000]  about how it works on the ground there, and definitely we'll be layering up in the event
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  that I get caught in any hairy situations, definitely be going with a helmet and eye protection this time,
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  because last time I went a bit naive and wished that I hadn't,
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  because there was a lot of stuff flying through the air, there were a lot of tear gas canisters flying,
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  and now apparently the police are using helicopters to deploy flashballs and tear gas from the sky,
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  so they're raining that down on what otherwise appeared to be sometimes just peaceful crowds
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  just to get them to disperse, and as you're showing there on screen,
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  they are reportedly also deploying actual semi-automatic or possibly automatic rifles
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  with live ammunition in the event that things get really hairy,
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  and this time I'm definitely going to be extra careful,
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:44.000]  because the journalists are not, they're not being protected from any of this as well.
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  There's a video circulating of an AFP journalist, and he's just filming the action,
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  and he catches one of these flashballs fired by an officer right in the kneecap,
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  and the word is it fractured or shattered his kneecap,
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  and there are other journalists who are being attacked by some of the gilets jaunes
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  who are very angry about the way that the mainstream press is covering them,
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  so they're just like journalists are just as much free game there on the ground as anybody else.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  And when the people strike, they don't just burn some cars like the radical Muslims do,
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  and here's the thing, people can make fun of French all day.
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  I've read my history books, one of the last places the Romans couldn't conquer, Julius Caesar finally did,
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  in Napoleon, all those wars.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  What killed so many of the alpha males is that only the non-alpha males were left.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  France used to be one of the most, there was the French, you know, and the Norman,
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  together with the Vikings conquered Old England, nobody, even the Romans couldn't conquer,
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  so the French used to be absolutely vicious fighters,
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  and they've still got some of the best men out there.
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  It's just that they've got a bunch of genetic men that have learned to lay down,
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  but once it triggers though, and once it starts, you have these militarized EU police,
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  they shoot somebody, don't the authoritarians get, this is what ends them?
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  They shoot people with regular firearms, it's over.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  They're going to have French doctors scalpel-ing police in the neck, which I don't want,
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  but the police should take note of this in America, everywhere else.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  We didn't bring us here, we're not funding Black Lives Matter killing you,
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  we're not trying to implode the country and bring in jihadis, but we're not going to take it anymore,
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  we're under attack, it's over, we're ready to fight,
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  and if the damn French are in gear, can you imagine America in gear?
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  Absolutely, you have guys going out there, there's this boxer, Christophe Dutton-J,
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  he was out there and he just, he had it up to the eyeballs,
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  he got tear gas with his wife, and he just started just raining fists down on riot police,
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  and he did quite a lot of damage.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  I love how they've got shields in masks and they're acting like they're wimps,
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  I mean, tough guy, but why, I mean, you know, I'm not just going after the feet of the legs,
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  but I get it, the point is these guys in their own gear can't even handle a real man.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  Yeah, there's video even of these police in their full gear,
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  and they're throwing cobblestones and stones back at the crowds,
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  who of course are not wearing this type of gear, so a lot of these...
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  How about the French join, how about the French police join the people, damn it,
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  and we can have part two of the, I mean, they need to understand the people have been put in the corner,
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  the taxes are so high, the average person's going bankrupt,
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  they start the fight with us and then wonder why people are angry.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  We're not looking for a fight with them, they just need to get off our ass.
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  Absolutely, and there have been signs that some of the police will, you know,
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  they'll at least stand down, but...
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  Well, that's happened a lot, that's why I said they brought in the EU armored vehicles,
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  the unmarked police, it's been admitted, they've got French speaking foreigners, what, Dutch,
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  they've got Danish, I mean, the word is they brought in a bunch of foreign troops.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  Absolutely, and a lot of them blend in with the crowd, they'll just go plain clothes
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  and then all of a sudden, it'll be like a whole, basically like a team of mercenaries,
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  that just, you think that they're, you know, with you and then all of a sudden they're dragging...
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  And what I read is, just like Germany's the head of the EU,
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  I heard there's a lot of Germans driving those tanks, and nothing against Germans, I'll part German,
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  but Germans again are used to take over Europe,
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  I've read the French are getting freaked out that there are plain clothes Germans policing them,
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  the last time that happened was World War II.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  Yes, and the Germans, Merkel and Macron are establishing ties, they're really solidifying their ties,
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  I think that they detect this unrest coming from Eastern Europe and even within their own countries
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  and they're trying to consolidate power here at the last minute,
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  so they are really working towards establishing a military relationship.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  And doesn't that make him truly a Vici collaborator that he's doing that against his own country?
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  Yeah, it's unbelievable, it's Macron, I don't even know how he's still in there,
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  I can't imagine he hangs in much longer,
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  but I do predict that if he is removed that he'll just be replaced by another globalist stooge.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  Well, don't the police get past the PR, you shoot a woman and her kids or people out there,
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  cops are going to be getting knifed on the street, they're going to get attacked in bars,
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  and we don't... the police really ought to...
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  I know they're taking orders, but they're about to get their ass handed to them.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  Yeah, that famous line we were only following orders,
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  I think a lot of these guys need to look deep down inside and see,
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  what are they really standing for and whose bidding are they really doing,
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  because a lot of these French would gladly accept them on their side of things,
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  and it's just crazy, and it's spreading throughout Europe,
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  so everyone needs to keep an eye on what's going on in France
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  and realize that it's coming to your country as well, most likely.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  Yeah, France hit with like 3 million of the 15 million illegal alien Muslims running around raping and pissing on everyone,
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  and the family of the French people are like, families are out there, like, we're done, we're done,
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  we want this over, we want out of the EU, get this off our back,
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  and the police are like, no, we're with Islam, and the people are like, okay, let's go,
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  you picked the wrong team, French police!
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day,
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.000]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day

[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive to get to the gym,
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:26.000]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash news letter and sign up via email
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:38.000]  so there's no way the sensors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to, the bare minimum you can do is sign up
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash news letter.
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:47:22.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  Look at those armored vehicles rolling along in Paris with Ewan Signia.
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  They'll teach those dirty French to say no to carbon taxes and bring in all the Muslims.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  By the way, the Robert Mueller probe is really coming to a filthy head.
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  They are really, really, really trying to connect me to groups I've never had any connection to.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  Which shows they need to be stood up to in a big way.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  But whatever, I'm not worried about it the other day.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  Thank God I'm not pedophile defending globalist, Islamic defending trash like you.
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:08.000]  Theresa May's Brexit plan rejected by British Parliament.
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  So she'll probably get a no confidence vote removed now.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:14.000]  432 to 202.
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:18.000]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  Going back to Dan Lyman, EuropeWars.com.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  Dan, I've been asking the questions here today.
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  Paul Watson is, as they say, ready for war, loaded for bear, locked, cocked, ready to cock.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  He started his engines.
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000]  And that's coming up here in just about 10 minutes or so.
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  But other points, even a great guest, great info wars reporter, EuropeWars.com.
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  Everybody should watch that.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  You're going to be in the middle of the LFS demonstrations coming up the next few days.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  Everybody should spread those so that your work gets the attention it needs in this fight for Europe.
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  And everybody's future against the globalist.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  But other points here in the next six, seven minutes that you haven't gotten to, that I haven't raised.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  What do you want to say to the public out there?
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  Well, yes, you were just mentioning it's the fight for Europe.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  And it is the fight for Europe at this point.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  There's just so much going on every single day.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  And I log on and just start reading.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  And it's just, it's incredible the amount of horrific crimes that are being committed every single day.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  And then being stabbed by jihadis, mass rapes.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  I mean, that can't even keep track of it.
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000]  It is hard to keep track of.
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000]  I mean, just today alone, just going through.
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  There's a 16 year old Austrian girl who strangled to death by a Syrian.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  The police already knew of this guy and they knew she was being harassed by him.
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000]  And he still got away with it.
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  We have up in Finland this exploding grooming gang situation.
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  And Katie Hopkins doing amazing reporting up there.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  And they're uncovering just a network after network of grooming gangs that are targeting very young Finnish girls under the age of 10.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  In some cases, just stunning Sweden unraveling by the day.
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000]  We're doing stories out of Sweden all the time.
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  We could do a story every day out of Sweden or multiple.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  I mean, there's some nights recently had three explosions that drive by shooting a kidnapping and an arson attack all just in one night in Sweden.
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  We have the situation with in France at Calais where they're basically they're still storming the UK shores at this point, both by land on the trucks and also by sea.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  So they're starting to land by sea on the UK shores there.
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:26.000]  We have a story from a couple of days ago.
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  A woman found a bunch of migrants just standing in her front yard, a bunch of Iranian men who were apprehended.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:36.000]  And just taken a boat over from France to the UK.
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  So it's just endless.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  Let's be clear about that.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  We covered it then.
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  Try to pull it up.
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  Literal now that the the Soros funded boats are now arriving in England.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  Yeah, they're they're storming the shores of the UK and apparently the UK is powerless to stop them.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:06.000]  I can guarantee you that if a bunch of French Gilles Jean were trying to storm the shores of the UK from France, they'd find a way to shut that down real fast.
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  So it's definitely a choice as to how they want to delegate responsibilities and their resources at this point.
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000]  And, you know, I mean, just it remains to be seen.
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:21.000]  But what I see happening in France, it is catching fire across Europe and it will grow and grow.
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:29.000]  I commend the French the French for now holding on for 10 weeks, keeping things the pressure against the French government.
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000]  And I imagine they will continue.
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:32.000]  And it's the middle winter.
[02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  Imagine if it was nice out.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000]  I mean, if they continue into the spring, this could go all year.
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:41.000]  And I want to be clear because always growing up, the French are the wamps, the French are the enemy.
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:47.000]  And I'm not hearing something to try to defend the French because they have been pathetically weak for their own country.
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:50.000]  They obsess over their culture and then just give it away.
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000]  But I've studied history.
[02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:53.000]  The French have been through a lot.
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:52:01.000]  If we could just rouse them, the Spanish that launched the Crusades, they'd lost 80 percent of their country, millions enslaved.
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  And, you know, Spain lays down to Islam now.
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:12.000]  If we can just ignite Spain and ignite France, you've got the prime minister and president of Italy,
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  both saying there's an axis of pro-Islamic evil in France and in Germany, which is totally true.
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:24.000]  He said, we must have a new access of Eastern Europe and Italy to counter it.
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.000]  And this is a talk.
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000]  This is really happening.
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:31.000]  And it was Eastern Europe that blocked the Islamic invasions hundreds of times.
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:32.000]  So this is the choice.
[02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  I mean, you know, they go, oh, it's white supremacy to defend Europe.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  You damn right, I defend Europe.
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:38.000]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  You want to overthrow it and murder and rape women and kill gays and crap all over the ground and all the rest of this.
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:45.000]  You're damn right.
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:46.000]  I want to preserve it.
[02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000]  Europe has 80 percent down tourism.
[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:51.000]  So, Dan, why the hell would the elite want to do something like this?
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:54.000]  Because this has got people waking up big time.
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000]  Yeah, this is a suicide mission.
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:01.000]  Another interesting development is in Ireland.
[02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  As you might know, there's the Ireland 2040 plan, which they've been rolling out mildly stealthily.
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  I mean, the documents are there if you want to read them.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:15.000]  And basically, Ireland has a population of about 4.5 to 4.8 million people.
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:20.000]  They want to increase that by 1 million by 2040, basically exclusively with migrants.
[02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  And Stefan Malinou took it upon himself to deliver an over two hour presentation, breaking the entire thing down.
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:35.000]  And it's my understanding now that the video has gone totally viral in Ireland, like top 15 trending videos on YouTube.
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:40.000]  And they're in damage control mode because the Irish are waking up to the game plan.
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:49.000]  And Malinou has offered, if they wanted, he would fly into Ireland and debate the whole thing on state broadcast, the RTE broadcast there.
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:53.000]  Of course, I'm sure they won't have him on, but it's heroic efforts like that.
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  You just need to wake the people up, spread the information, use our articles, use the articles at Breitbart, get on the Drudge Report, share information.
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:08.000]  This is the year when people can really make a difference, but they have to step up to the plate in whatever capacity they can,
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:17.000]  especially by spreading information and supporting us, supporting radio broadcasts and podcasts that are sharing information like Malinou's.
[02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:26.000]  And we really need to get the information out there because we're right at the tipping point where I think we can wake enough people up and turn things back in the opposite direction.
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  That's right, Dan. And this is megacorporations using third world populations.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:37.000]  They've already exploited their own words to attack and bring down the West and then be able to collapse society and buy it all up for pennies on the dollar.
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  This is the cold-blooded move we're witnessing, and it must be opposed, and it's incredibly historical.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:50.000]  But as Newtonian physics shows, for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction, and we're seeing the great reaction all over the world.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:58.000]  So as they say, it's the best of times, worst of times, but when the audience gets excited, and when the audience shares the live feed,
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:11.000]  on their Facebook, on their YouTube, on their own text message, on their phone or on their email, that's what overrides the globalist and the radical Islamists and George Soros.
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  That's what crushes them in the fight. So when you get excited, when that chain reaction takes place, that's what moves mountains.
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  That's what changes the world. And I know I've come to you time and time again and said, keep fighting, but you know what?
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  It's because you're like the blood in my veins, in my arteries, and I am yours.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  It's literally, I'm saying keep fighting, keep fighting. I'm saying keep fighting in the morning and at night, in the middle of the night when I wake up,
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  thinking about this, I am going to keep fighting because the cost is too great not to keep fighting.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  So I salute you and thank you, but I order you to energize and take action in the main fight against the enemy,
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  and you will find your destiny and empowerment in that animating contest that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  Now is the time to release your energy or be slaves forever or join the enemy and serve them.
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  But whatever you do, make a decision about your destiny and get in the information war today.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:12.000]  They're not censoring us and blocking us as enemy number one because we're liars.
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:18.000]  It's because we're strong and we're the opposite of sociopaths and psychopaths and pedophiles.
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:22.000]  We want to empower the children. We want to build new worlds.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  We want to see the next level of human development. We're fans of humanity. We're confident men and women,
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  but we need to join together in this fight and get past the intimidation, the lies, the globalists,
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  and what we could do together is unlimited.
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  Dan Lyman, we pray for you. We appreciate you. EuropeWars.com and God bless you.
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  And we will be watching what you do. When do you arrive in Paris for the next big yellow vest clash as they have live ammo?
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  I'll be there early morning on Saturday all the way through the evening when the big stuff is going down.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  I appreciate everyone's prayers. Definitely going to be hairy on the ground there.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:08.000]  So I'll definitely be trying to keep a low profile and get as much excellent footage to expose the world to what is going on.
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  Well, you always say yes, sir, to me on the phone when you rarely call me.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  I say yes, sir, to you. You're in the field. You're on point.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  So don't hesitate. You call me hours before you get in position.
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  I'll be here live covering it. My friend, we salute you and we thank you as a warrior for freedom.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:24.000]  God bless you.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  Thank you.
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  This is what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen, fighting the globalists at Point Blank Range.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  Yesterday, it's Laura Loomer on the property of Nancy Pelosi with illegal aliens building a tent city pointing under hypocrisy.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  Today, it's Dan Lyman going in to the live ammo operations. It's the real world and we're fighting for the future.
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:54.000]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the Info War to fight the globalist and limited free society.

[02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:55.000]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  The boys tell how Banjo fell and left his living in cheap hotels.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:26.000]  So the story ends, we're told.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:30.000]  I don't need your prayers, it's true.
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:34.000]  To save a few, we left it to.
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  He only did what he had to do.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  Now he's grown old.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  And now he's grown old.
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45,
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  Now I can be there for my children.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  Now I can make them strong.
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  Now I can instruct them.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:04.000]  But not once I'm gone.
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  You think of this digital age, your words gone forever, but now they're even better,
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000]  getting rid of what you said they were before.
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:14.000]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages,
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  We are living in a truly amazing, incredible, epic time, and I'm honored to be here.
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  You know, I've been punished and demonized in attack because we deprive this audience,
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  Paul Watson, coming up.
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  We deprived the globalist of their great price.
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  Their queen, Hillary, and the great race war, and the great sex battle.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:46.000]  But you see the Gillette commercials, they're still going on with the great class war,
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  the great war of the sexes, as if she was still in power.
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  And that's because they put groups, little stay-behind mole groups, in the government.
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  We first told you that two years ago.
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  Now it's admitted.
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  But I have joined my will, not like Shoron to the ring, but in a good way, to the resistance.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000]  I can't be destroyed now.
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000]  Not my name, who I am.
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  As long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth,
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  and you can't be destroyed either, as long as you understand that.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  As long as you bind yourself, swear yourself, that isn't just words,
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  but actually bind yourself to something and commit to it.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:38.000]  I don't want to say it's sexual, like you have sex with an idea, but it's similar.
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  When you commit to it, and become it, and go through the fire for it,
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  there is a magic that then takes place, that transcends space and time.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:56.000]  And that's why, before we go to break and pull, Joseph Watson takes over today,
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:00.000]  I want to just recommit to listeners and viewers.
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  Despite the fact they make it harder than ever to find us, and they battle to shut us down.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  I don't just say this to build you up.
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  I say it because it is the very oxygen I breathe.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  When you commit, be a word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos,
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  or to do your own show, or to do your own review on YouTube and talk about newswars.com,
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:30.000]  that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  And unlike the thousands of fake voices in the pantheon of BS,
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:47.000]  Info Wars is as close to the reality of the universe as you're going to get.
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  The enemy knows how things work, but it's chosen to cheat the public,
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  not giving them the Promethean fire.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  We choose to give ourselves the fire, and we choose to share the fire with you,
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  so that in your own understanding of the fire, you might give us greater understanding as well,
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:06.000]  in that communion that goes on eternally.
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  And that's why, without your support, we will fall.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:14.000]  With your support, we are together in victory.
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  So please now, commit to support Info Wars however you can,
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:24.000]  and realize your provision to Info Wars is your own provision.
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  We're going to come back on the other side, and Paul Joseph Watson,
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  ready for the attack, and the next round, a fresh horseman in the fight.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  The cavalry arrives, and then in 55 minutes, the war room,
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  Owen Shroyer, Roger Stone, and other embattled patriots,
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:46.000]  take to the field, yet again, in the quest for human liberty.
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:05:12.000]  Stay with us.
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  We hope you experienced the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:24.000]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways,
[03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:27.000]  including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health,
[03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:32.000]  aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:36.000]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:39.000]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:42.000]  unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate,
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:45.000]  paired with our ultimate fish oil, or used separately.
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:48.000]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with ultimate krill oil,
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:55.000]  now available at infowarstore.com.
[03:05:55.000 --> 03:06:05.000]  News, analysis, reports, it's the Alex Jones Show,
[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:11.000]  and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:19.000]  We're live in the fourth hour of this January 15, 2009 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:22.000]  Of course, breaking news you've probably seen.
[03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:26.000]  Theresa May's deal is voted down in historic Commons defeat.
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:31.000]  This is the largest defeat for a sitting government in the history of UK politics.
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:38.000]  Of course, her Brexit deal was not a fulfillment of what 17.1 million people voted for in Britain.
[03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:43.000]  So the fact that this deal failed is good if you actually believe in a proper Brexit.
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:47.000]  The reason why it failed is because Brexit is trying to be delayed,
[03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:51.000]  the elite in the United Kingdom, the globalists who have no loyalty to their own country,
[03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:55.000]  are trying to delay it, kick the can further and further down the road,
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:58.000]  and eventually derail Brexit altogether.
[03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:02.000]  That's why the majority of them at least voted down this deal.
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:09.000]  Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal has been rejected by 230 votes, reports the BBC,
[03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:12.000]  the largest defeat for a sitting government in history.
[03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  MPs voted by 432 votes to 202 to reject the deal,
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:20.000]  which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU on 29 March.
[03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000]  Of course, it didn't do that.
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:23.000]  It kept us in the EU.
[03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:31.000]  It was an absolute ridiculous capitulation to the globalists in Brussels,
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000]  and it's good that this deal failed.
[03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:39.000]  But again, the entire process has been one long exercise in capitulation and in betrayal.
[03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000]  What happens next?
[03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:45.000]  Well, the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, the socialists,
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:51.000]  some would call him the communist, has filed a motion of no confidence in the government.
[03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:54.000]  So basically tomorrow there will be a vote on that.
[03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:57.000]  If the government collapses, which it well could,
[03:07:57.000 --> 03:08:02.000]  then we could have another general election within a matter of weeks.
[03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:07.000]  And of course, that will then be exploited as another reason to sabotage Brexit.
[03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:13.000]  In fact, a good explainer on this is James Dellingpole's article over at Breitbart.
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:17.000]  Until Britain gets full Brexit, there can be never be peace in the realm.
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:21.000]  He points out the reason May's deal is going to be voted down,
[03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000]  which it has as of about 20 minutes ago,
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:28.000]  is because Parliament is chock full of Remainers who see taking down May's deal
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:34.000]  Of course, Theresa May herself is a Remainer.
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:37.000]  Virtually her entire cabinet are Remainers.
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  And he goes on to say basically this is completely unprecedented.
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:48.000]  We have the extraordinary spectacle of MPs not just ignoring the clearly expressed wishes of the electorate they represent,
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:53.000]  but actually trying to claim that this betrayal is their way of honoring democracy.
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  So again, we see the same EU model time and time again,
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  which we warned about before Brexit.
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:06.000]  Just keep making the people vote over and over again until you get the result you want.
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:10.000]  They're still trying to push that second referendum and by creating enough chaos,
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  enough political gridlock, they may just get it.
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:18.000]  We reported before on a report in the Sunday Times,
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:24.000]  which basically said the government was considering triggering a financial collapse,
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  literally provocaturing a financial collapse in the United Kingdom to create enough chaos,
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  to create enough bedlam, to back out of Brexit altogether.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:36.000]  That still very much remains on the table.
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  Delling poll writes, if a Remain dominated parliament gets its way, and it looks like it will, you wonder why we bothered writing Magna Carta or fighting the civil wars.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  He says, I cannot for the life of me see how they can be stability in Britain,
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:56.000]  so long as the majority of British people want to leave the EU and so long as the minority,
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  which represents them in parliament, persists in scorning them and frustrating them.
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  We've seen what's happened in France over the past nine weeks, which is a complete rejection of globalism.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  If this continues, if the democratic mandate given to our leaders by the British people continues to be betrayed,
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  what will happen in the streets of the UK?
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:24.000]  Brexit, meanwhile, Brexit campaign in Nigel Farage has said the political class,
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  ignoring the will of the people, is a, quote, complete betrayal of the greatest democratic exercise in the history of our nation.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  He goes on to point out our political class cannot accept the idea that we become an independent country.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  They haven't got the vision, they haven't got the breath, they haven't got the imagination,
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  and clearly none of them are looking at the channel, seeing what is happening in France right now, what's happening in Italy right now.
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  Of course, he's talking about the massive riots that have taken place in Paris and other major French cities over the past two months plus.
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:02.000]  He makes the point that European Union is about to go through a massive wholesale change,
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:06.000]  is our chance to lead the way to about Europe and sovereign countries working together.
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:10.000]  No deal, that's the only form of Brexit that's going to work at this point,
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:16.000]  but they've created so much fear mongering around it that basically they'll try anything else,
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  including overturning the democratic mandate of the British people.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:24.000]  39 billion pounds will not have to be paid to the EU.
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  Their own citizens, the EU citizens will have to pay that.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  That will make them more antagonistic towards the EU and will precipitate the EU's further decline and collapse.
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  The UK will be able to go out boldly into the world, make its own trade deals,
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:42.000]  have independence over its own tariffs, over its own laws.
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  Where's the downside?
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000]  Again, this is a complete betrayal.
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:50.000]  If we had no deal Brexit, we could actually get on with this.
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  We wouldn't be stuck in a transition period for years and years on end,
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  which is what is in all these crappy deals, which basically keep us in the EU.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  Again, creating the groundwork for the crisis, the financial crisis,
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:08.000]  which then precipitates us re-entering the EU,
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  whereas a clean break, bold trade deals we could go out in the world and make.
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:18.000]  If that was possible, if we actually had a prime minister that was fulfilling the mandate that we gave her,
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  then a clean break would be the best way of securing Brexit.
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  But again, it's not going to happen because our own leaders have betrayed us.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000]  They believe in the globalist project.
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:34.000]  They don't believe in the freedom and the independence of the United Kingdom.
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000]  UKIP has responded.
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:41.000]  Establishment fighting over their preferred method of stopping Brexit is the headline.
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:44.000]  And these are the comments of Gerard Batten,
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  who says advocates of a fresh general election is basically representative,
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  and that could happen in the next few weeks,
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  of the political establishment fighting over their preferred method of stopping Brexit.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  Batten went on to say, Mrs Maynose, she cannot win the vote on Tuesday.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  That just happened. She lost.
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:07.000]  She is attempting to present herself as a force for Brexit, but nobody is buying it.
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  Again, it was designed to fail from the very beginning.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:14.000]  She went there with an attitude of complete capitulation,
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  and the EU gave her a deal, which was a complete capitulation.
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:19.000]  What a surprise.
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  Batten went on to say, Mrs May's so-called deal would turn Britain into a vassal state of the EU,
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  prepared to go back in a few short years.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  And that is entirely the point.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  They need it to fail because the EU hates the threat of a good example.
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  If the UK leaves the EU or leaves it half in, half out, and that does fail,
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  which it will, because that defies the entire point,
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  then other European countries will see that and realize that they have to stay in the EU
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:54.000]  because it is authoritarian and because they will not be allowed to leave,
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:56.000]  because it's a mafia bureaucracy.
[03:13:56.000 --> 03:14:00.000]  That's why the EU has not given the UK a half-decent deal,
[03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  because again, if we got one and we were allowed to leave properly,
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:10.000]  there would be a great example to Italy and to all these other countries to follow suit.
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  So that's what's going on with Brexit.
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  Again, it's absolutely historic.
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  It's the biggest defeat for a sitting government in history.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:22.000]  Now, Jeremy Corbyn has tabled a vote of no confidence.
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:24.000]  Will there be another general election?
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:26.000]  Will the government collapse?
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:29.000]  Of course, back a couple of months ago, or a few weeks ago, at least,
[03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  we had the, it was in the middle of December, we had the no confidence vote
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:36.000]  for Theresa May herself.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  She won that, so there can be no no confidence vote against her
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  within the Conservative Party for another year.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:44.000]  But again, the government could collapse tomorrow,
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:47.000]  or there could be a new leader of the Conservative Party
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  after this no confidence vote is voted on tomorrow.
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  But again, they're deliberately creating this murky atmosphere
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:56.000]  where nobody knows what's happening.
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  Backing it up with relentless fear mongering in the media about,
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:04.000]  you know, super gonorrhea bugs and absolute bedlam,
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  you know, gridlock traffic, food shortages, army on the streets.
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:14.000]  If we get what we voted for, it's psychological intimidation,
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:16.000]  it's fear mongering, it's threats,
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:18.000]  and May herself has come out many times and said,
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  look, if you don't vote for this crappy deal,
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  which is not a deal at all, it's a surrender, it's terms of surrender,
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  then Brexit may not happen at all.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  She was using that as a form of intimidation
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:34.000]  when she's supposed to be the leader of the party
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:37.000]  who presented this as a referendum option in the first place
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  in their manifesto.
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:40.000]  She was tasked with carrying it out,
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:42.000]  carrying out the mandate of the British people.
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:46.000]  Now she's using it as a threat to derail Brexit,
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  an absolute complete betrayal.
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show Live

[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:59.000]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:01.000]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:03.000]  that it lowers IQ.
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:06.000]  It literally dumps the population down.
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:10.000]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world,
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:12.000]  we've gone through two permutations.
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:16.000]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source,
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:19.000]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:22.000]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine
[03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:25.000]  and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:32.000]  we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:36.000]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:38.000]  that by combining it with three other compounds,
[03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:41.000]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:46.000]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it,
[03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:50.000]  it's an incredible discovery.
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year,
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:26.000]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:31.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:34.000]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:42.000]  because we need you, the remnant of America,
[03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:46.000]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:48.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  we're changing the world.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:20:18.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:26.000]  Now obviously we've been tracking this controversy over the new Gillette ad,
[03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:28.000]  the best an in-cell can get.
[03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  And I'm going to draw attention to this BBC article
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:34.000]  because it ties into the current state of this video on YouTube,
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:37.000]  which is quite interesting how it's starting to shift now.
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  So there was a BBC headline, Gillette Faces Backlash and Boycott Over Me Too Advert,
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  in which in the first sentence of this BBC news article they said,
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:52.000]  a Gillette advert which references bullying, the Me Too movement and toxic masculinity
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:55.000]  as split opinion online.
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  That's right, split opinion.
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:00.000]  Okay, so when this article was published,
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:05.000]  the dislikes to likes ratio on YouTube was 10 to 1 against.
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:09.000]  10 to 1, thumbs down to thumbs up.
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:13.000]  Okay, now I've noticed over the past few hours or so,
[03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:17.000]  since this has took off and gone even more viral than it was yesterday,
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:23.000]  and you can see this if you go on the original YouTube video of this advert
[03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:25.000]  on Gillette's official YouTube channel,
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:29.000]  YouTube has put this ad number one trending on YouTube.
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:34.000]  Okay, so YouTube curates what happens in their trending section.
[03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  It's curated.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:40.000]  It's not organic because they only allow Jimmy Kimmel,
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:44.000]  these late night hosts to get on there pushing their propaganda.
[03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:48.000]  So they've deliberately put this Gillette ad number one on trending.
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:50.000]  So all the lefties and social,
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:54.000]  what justice warriors can rush to try to save its reputation?
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:56.000]  Because it was heading to be one of the most,
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:01.000]  if not the most, disliked ads on YouTube ever or on the internet ever.
[03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:03.000]  And it was 10 to 1 against.
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:06.000]  Now if you look at the thumbs up to thumbs down,
[03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  they've rallied somewhat behind it over the past few hours.
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:16.000]  It now has 112,000 thumbs up compared to 392,000 thumbs down.
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:18.000]  And definitely over the last few hours,
[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:22.000]  I've noticed that thumbs up ratio is increasing.
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  So they're trying to rescue the reputation.
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000]  It's still almost 4 to 1 against.
[03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:31.000]  But again, as I said before, it was 10 to 1 against.
[03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  Now they're trying to rally support behind it to basically say and face.
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:37.000]  But I've got a video coming out about this
[03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:41.000]  and how it ties into the wider war on masculinity after the show.
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:45.000]  But there's an article upon information liberation
[03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:48.000]  called Gillette the Worst an Ad Can Get.
[03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:51.000]  And this makes an interesting observation
[03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:54.000]  because we don't only have the collective demonization of all men,
[03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:58.000]  but we also have racism inserted into this ad.
[03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  And most people wouldn't have noticed this.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:04.000]  But of course they have a litany of examples
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:07.000]  of men behaving badly in the ad.
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.000]  You know, like grabbing on women
[03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:12.000]  or talking down to a woman in a corporate boardroom.
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:16.000]  Or there's another example of a white man
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:18.000]  cat calling a woman on the street
[03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:20.000]  and then a black man comes in to stop him.
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:22.000]  So he's cut it out. That's not acceptable.
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:25.000]  All the bad guys in the ad are white.
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:28.000]  Or almost all of them are white.
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:32.000]  Whereas almost all of the good guys are black.
[03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:35.000]  So not only is this a sexist ad,
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.000]  they actually made it racist too.
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:41.000]  And in fact, this is a Twitter user called Vito Gasaldi
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000]  who's pointed this out.
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:46.000]  And then someone over on the Donald subreddit did an analysis.
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:48.000]  In the Gillette commercial,
[03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:52.000]  43 males exhibit undesirable behavior.
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:56.000]  42 of them are white and one is black.
[03:23:56.000 --> 03:23:59.000]  Seven males exhibit desirable behavior.
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:03.000]  Five of them are black and two are white.
[03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:05.000]  So it's not only miss, Andrew.
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.000]  This is actually racism.
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:09.000]  This is another example of anti-white racism
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:12.000]  inserted into this advert.
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:14.000]  Which is kind of interesting
[03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:17.000]  because if you look at rape statistics in the United States,
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  which has a black male population of about 6%,
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:24.000]  last time I checked that they were responsible
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:26.000]  for about 38% of rapes,
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  vastly over-represented.
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:31.000]  Now, I'm not saying that black men
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.000]  should be collectively demonized for that
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:36.000]  because men in general shouldn't be collectively demonized for that.
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:38.000]  But it's interesting, isn't it,
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:42.000]  how out of 43 males exhibiting undesirable behavior,
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:45.000]  42 of them were white.
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:47.000]  Nobody's really pointed that out.
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:51.000]  I think that's a bigger or almost as big a scandal
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:53.000]  as the actual sexist,
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  the standard connotations of the ad itself.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:58.000]  And this article makes another point.
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:00.000]  You probably remember,
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:02.000]  a few years ago now there was a viral YouTube video
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:06.000]  called Ten Hours of Walking in New York City as a Woman.
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:09.000]  And when people pointed out in this video
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  that the vast majority of people,
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:14.000]  men, kept calling this woman
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:16.000]  were non-white.
[03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:18.000]  The producer of the video came out
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  with an absolutely absurd lie
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  claiming that, and this was his quote,
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:25.000]  we got a fair amount of white guys,
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:27.000]  but for whatever reason,
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:29.000]  a lot of what they said was in passing or off camera
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:32.000]  or was ruined by siren or other noise.
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:34.000]  So the fact that they documented
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:37.000]  the vast majority of catcalls this woman was getting
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:39.000]  were from non-white people.
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  They then had to lie and claim,
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:43.000]  oh no, there were plenty of white people catcalling her.
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:46.000]  We just didn't get the audio right.
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:48.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:52.000]  So now you see a similar narrative
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:54.000]  with this Gillette ad
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:58.000]  in that all the bad behavior is done by white men.
[03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:00.000]  All the good behavior is done by black men.
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:03.000]  Again, so it's racist as well as sexist.
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:06.000]  And as I said, I've got a video coming out about this
[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:08.000]  because of course it ties in with
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:10.000]  the American Psychological Association
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  a couple of days ago
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:14.000]  coming out and saying that
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:18.000]  stoicism as a part of toxic masculinity
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:22.000]  is negative for young men and boys.
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  Again, we live in a society where depression
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  is supposedly accelerating.
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  Of course, suicide rates amongst men are accelerating.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:33.000]  And they're literally telling them that stoicism is bad.
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:36.000]  Stoicism is an entire lifestyle change.
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:39.000]  It's about dealing with bad situations,
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  changing bad situations by relying on stoicism.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  Of course, it's a branch of philosophy.
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:47.000]  It's not just a, you know,
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:50.000]  cliched, generic, stiff-up, alive kind of attitude.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:52.000]  It's rooted in philosophy.
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:54.000]  It's not a bandaid. It's not a pill.
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:56.000]  And it works.
[03:26:56.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  So again, this is the point I make over and over again.
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:02.000]  The more they tell men to not act like men,
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:04.000]  which is inherent in this Gillette ad,
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:08.000]  the more they tell men to talk about their feelings,
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:11.000]  the more men wallow in their feelings,
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:14.000]  the more the suicide rate increases.
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:18.000]  Again, we're told, oh, there's such a stigma around depression.
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:20.000]  There's no stigma.
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:24.000]  Everybody constantly talks about it on social media,
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  on television, in entertainment.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:30.000]  It's always people gloviating about their depression,
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:32.000]  how depressed they are,
[03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  mainly privileged people who've got everything else going for them in the world.
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:37.000]  Oh, but they're still depressed.
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:40.000]  The more they tell men to be weak-minded
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  and constantly obsessed with and wallowing in their feelings,
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  the worse depression gets,
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  the more suicide rates increase.
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  And yeah, that's not to say that people with serious mental problems,
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  PTSD or things like that,
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:56.000]  don't need therapists and that doesn't help.
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:27:58.000]  Of course it helps.
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  But you've got an entire generation of people
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:02.000]  who claim to be depressed
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:04.000]  because they want attention,
[03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  because they're narcissists,
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:08.000]  and because social media encourages that.
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:11.000]  And we've got an entire depression industrial complex
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:14.000]  based around the doling out of pharmaceutical drugs,
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:17.000]  which is a multi-multi-billion-dollar industry,
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:21.000]  which also wants to encourage people to be depressed
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:24.000]  and says that there is no other solution to depression
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:26.000]  other than doling out pills,
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:29.000]  which just by coincidence makes billions and billions of dollars
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  for mainstream media corporations
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  and giant pharmaceutical corporations.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:39.000]  So we're going to get more into this Gillette out of the wider societal trend
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:42.000]  that it reflects in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  Break it news at infowalls.com.
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:29:05.000]  We'll be right back. I'll go away.
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.000]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:21.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:28.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:31.000]  should be using this product as a preventative
[03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:30:16.000 --> 03:30:18.000]  Heart and body extract 866-295-5305.
[03:30:46.000 --> 03:30:56.000]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day
[03:30:56.000 --> 03:31:00.000]  to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park
[03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:02.000]  or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:05.000]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen
[03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:08.000]  and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:11.000]  But thanks to supermailvitality at infowallstore.com,
[03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:13.000]  I still have that energy.
[03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:16.000]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day
[03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:19.000]  to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water
[03:31:19.000 --> 03:31:22.000]  to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle
[03:31:22.000 --> 03:31:24.000]  with the screen time and the extended hours
[03:31:24.000 --> 03:31:28.000]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:31.000]  to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise
[03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:34.000]  that you need for your health.

[03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:36.000]  only at the beginning of the colon,
[03:32:36.000 --> 03:32:39.000]  but our premium, organic acacia fiber
[03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:42.000]  is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:44.000]  throughout the entire colon

[03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:25.000]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:30.000]  Now, we're continuing to talk about this Gillette ad
[03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  and what it reflects for the wider societal narrative
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:36.000]  of the war on men and masculinity.
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:39.000]  There was a good quote from an RT article today
[03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:41.000]  by Slavos Zizek,
[03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:44.000]  who is a communist philosopher, basically,
[03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:47.000]  but he still opposes political correctness.
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:50.000]  Headline, traditional masculinity, toxic.
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:53.000]  New universe of subtle corruption emerges.
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:57.000]  And he was talking about the American Psychological Association
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:01.000]  proclamation that traditional masculinity is now toxic,
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:04.000]  that it's actually bad for young men and boys
[03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:06.000]  to act like young men and boys.
[03:34:06.000 --> 03:34:08.000]  He said this,
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:11.000]  if in the old days of heterosexual normativity,
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:14.000]  homosexuality was treated as illness,
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:17.000]  it is now masculinity itself
[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:21.000]  which is medicalized and turned into a sickness to be fought.
[03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:23.000]  So they've actually switched it around.
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:26.000]  You know, the whole gay rights lobby was up in arms about
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:30.000]  homosexuality once being treated as a mental illness,
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:32.000]  which is fair enough.
[03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:34.000]  I believe people are born that way.
[03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:36.000]  But now they've switched it around completely
[03:34:36.000 --> 03:34:39.000]  to where heterosexuality and masculinity
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:42.000]  is treated as some form of mental illness.
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:46.000]  Just the rate at which that switch is absolutely astounding.
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:48.000]  And there was another quote here
[03:34:48.000 --> 03:34:51.000]  by David French writing in the national review.
[03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:53.000]  He says this,
[03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:55.000]  the assault on traditional masculinity,
[03:34:55.000 --> 03:34:58.000]  while liberating to men who don't fit traditional norms,
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:00.000]  soy boys in other words,
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:02.000]  is itself harmful to the millions of young men
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:05.000]  who seek to be physically and mentally tough,
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:08.000]  stoicism, to rise to challenges
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:11.000]  and demonstrate leadership under pressure, of course,
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:13.000]  all things that men excel at,
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:16.000]  all things that keep men energized,
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:18.000]  engaged and happy.
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:19.000]  He continues,
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:21.000]  the assault on traditional masculinity
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:24.000]  is an assault on their very natures.
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:26.000]  So again,
[03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  if we treat traditional masculinity,
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:30.000]  if we treat boys being boys
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:33.000]  as a form of mental illness, something to be discouraged,
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  even though that's their innate natural biological instinct
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:37.000]  to act that way,
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:41.000]  depression is going to increase exponentially.
[03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:44.000]  And yet it's the American Psychological Association
[03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:46.000]  telling us to do that.
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:48.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  We are truly living in the upside-down world.
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:54.000]  And as to this advert itself,
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:56.000]  here's the thing.
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:35:59.000]  Rapists aren't going to be discouraged from raping people
[03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:03.000]  just because you told them that rape is bad.
[03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:05.000]  They're going to go ahead with it anyway.
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:07.000]  In the future, in a few years' time,
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:10.000]  a rapist is ripping some poor woman's clothes off.
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  He's not going to suddenly stop
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:15.000]  and be all remorseful because a Gillette ad
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  from a few years ago flashed across his mind.
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:21.000]  Rapists aren't going to be deterred from raping
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  because of a television commercial
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:25.000]  for a damn razor blade.
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:28.000]  So again, the only effect that this ad has
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:31.000]  is to insult the intelligence of men
[03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:33.000]  who are never going to be rapists,
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:37.000]  who are never going to be sexual abusers at all.
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  Again, are we going to start seeing tampons ads
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:45.000]  which go on about emphasizing the importance
[03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:48.000]  of women giving men joint custody of children?
[03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:50.000]  Are they going to be lectured that way?
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:52.000]  Are we going to have makeup commercials
[03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:54.000]  that are going to start lecturing women
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:57.000]  not to make false rape accusations?
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:00.000]  Are we going to see that instead of maybe it's may-believe?
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:03.000]  Are we going to see maybe it's make-believe?
[03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:05.000]  No, it's not going to happen
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:08.000]  because only men are in this privileged position
[03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:11.000]  to be constantly lectured, hectic,
[03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:15.000]  and denigrated about their basic innate biology
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:18.000]  and insulted to the point where they have to be told
[03:37:18.000 --> 03:37:21.000]  not to rape women, not to assault women.
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:23.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  And also, of course, there's a message in this ad
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:31.000]  where they show basically rough-and-tumble play with two boys,
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:34.000]  and then one of the parents steps in and discourages that.
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  Again, this is all done in an effort,
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:40.000]  according to this droopy corporate feminist ad,
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:43.000]  to reduce bullying and harassment.
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:46.000]  Newsflash, it's only going to have the effect
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:49.000]  of turning boys into posses who can't fight,
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:51.000]  who can't stand up for themselves,
[03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:55.000]  increasing the chances that they'll be bullied and harassed.
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  It's going to have the exact opposite effect.
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:00.000]  What they call toxic masculinity
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:04.000]  is what we men call surviving in the real world.
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:08.000]  If you teach your boy to be a soft, blubbering, crybaby idiot
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:11.000]  who is completely obsessed with his feelings
[03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:13.000]  and constantly wallowing in his feelings,
[03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:16.000]  he's going to grow up to be a victim.
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:18.000]  And he's going to get the crap kicked out of him
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  on several occasions.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:25.000]  He's going to have a lot of problem with bullying and harassment.
[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:27.000]  But again, most people have missed this.
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:29.000]  It all comes back to power.
[03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:31.000]  As everything does with the left,
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:34.000]  it always comes back to raw power.
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:38.000]  Women are, of course, way more likely to vote left-wing,
[03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:42.000]  whereas studies show that masculine personality traits
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:45.000]  are directly associated with voting
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:50.000]  for conservative, right-wing, and populist political parties.
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:52.000]  So again, that's the entire point.
[03:38:52.000 --> 03:38:54.000]  By eradicating masculinity,
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:58.000]  you eradicate an entire voting bloc.
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  So it's the most crude form of Machiavellianism
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  disguised as progressivism.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:08.000]  It's about creating a voting bloc
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  or eliminating a voting bloc
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:13.000]  just as importing millions and millions of immigrants,
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:15.000]  both legal and illegal,
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:17.000]  is about creating a voting bloc.
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:20.000]  It's all about power.
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:23.000]  And again, it ties into the APA thing again.
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:27.000]  They said competitiveness, achievement, and risk-taking,
[03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:29.000]  which, again, are three core principles
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:32.000]  of strident, successful masculinity,
[03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:35.000]  what makes men happy, what keeps them engaged,
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:39.000]  what keeps them active, they're denigrated.
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:42.000]  It all ties into this depression-industrial complex
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:45.000]  where we're told constantly to wallow in our feelings,
[03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  to talk about our feelings, to talk about depression.
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:50.000]  How we're all so damn depressed.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  Oh, but there's a stigma around depression.
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:54.000]  There's no stigma whatsoever.
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:56.000]  We're bathed in it.
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  It's everywhere.
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:59.000]  We can't get away from it.
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:03.000]  So again, it's normalized to the point where everybody's depressed.
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:09.000]  And there's no reason to sort out your crappy situational life.
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:11.000]  There's no reason to change your situation.
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:15.000]  You can just be a fat slob with no get-up-and-go whatsoever,
[03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:19.000]  with no goals, with no achievements, because it's not your fault.
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.000]  It's just something bad going on in your head.
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  It's depression.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:27.000]  Isn't that a convenient excuse for lazy people across the West?
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:29.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:33.000]  Again, telling men that they're natural biological impulse
[03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:37.000]  to behave like men, which, again, goes back to stoicism.
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:42.000]  Being stoic, being strong-minded, being able to deal with bad things
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:47.000]  that happen in your life, that is in a male biological characteristic.
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:49.000]  That's how you deal with depression.
[03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:51.000]  That's how you deal with suffering.
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:54.000]  If you tell people that that's wrong, that that's some kind of mental illness,
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:59.000]  that's only going to increase depression.
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:05.000]  There was a tweet by somebody, which I'm going to feature in my video the other day,
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:07.000]  and she made this point.
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:13.000]  She said, toxic masculinity, 43% of boys are raised by single mothers,
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:17.000]  and 78% of teachers are female.
[03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:22.000]  So close to 50% of boys have 100% feminine influence at home,
[03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:26.000]  and 80% feminine influence at school.
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:28.000]  Toxic masculinity isn't the problem.
[03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:31.000]  The lack of masculinity is.
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:34.000]  And then you can look at it from another perspective,
[03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:41.000]  which is the fact that this is just free advertising via lame virtue signaling.
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:46.000]  The amount that this advertising would cost would run into tens and tens of millions of dollars.
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:51.000]  They've created a viral video that's captured news attention across the globe.
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  The equivalent amount in free advertising that that would equate to is absolutely monumental.
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:00.000]  So people keep saying, is Gillette going to apologize?
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:02.000]  They've offended so many people.
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:04.000]  No, they're not going to apologize.
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:08.000]  When Nike made Colin Kaepernick the face of their Just Do It campaign,
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  we had the same outrage, the same uproar.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:13.000]  People supposedly boycotting Nike.
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:16.000]  What happened a couple of months later?
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:23.000]  Their stock was up 5%, and they made $6 billion on that advertising campaign,
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  because most people don't care.
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:27.000]  They just see Gillette in the news headlines.
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  They don't even read the news.
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  It just triggers a purchase impulse in their brain, and they just buy more Gillette.
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:37.000]  They don't even understand the situation. They don't even read the news.
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  So again, they're not going to apologize.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:42.000]  This is free advertising via virtue signaling.
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:45.000]  It's a tried and trusted method of marketing,
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:50.000]  and Gillette has pulled it off just as Nike pulled it off with Kaepernick.
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live breaking news, Infowars.

[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:34.000]  I want to tell you about, and this is quite apropos given what's happening with the Gillette ad.
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  InfowarsStore.com we have the last run ever of super male vitality.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:47.000]  This is the backlash against Gillette and the classification of masculinity as mental illness as they're trying to do now.
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:52.000]  For years, super male vitality has changed lives and received thousands of five-star reviews today
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:58.000]  where no longer able to procure many of the wild-crafted herbs that are crucial to the super male formula,
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  which is why we're being forced to announce the absolute final run of super male vitality.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:06.000]  Once our limited supply is gone, it's gone.

[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  Now, we talked about the attack on masculinity.
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:57.000]  That's not happening in Brazil because they've got a president that actually believes in supporting the dignity of his own population.
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:50:02.000]  Brazil's Bolsonaro vows to end gender brainwashing of children in schools.
[03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:09.000]  He's vowed to put an end to educational programs in schools that teach a boy that he's not a boy and a girl that she's not a girl.
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:14.000]  Now, of course, they appointed an education minister there when Bolsonaro was elected.
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  He was tasked with re-establishing the country's education system to supplant the previous model,
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:26.000]  which, in his words, dismantled traditional values of society, family, religion and patriotism.
[03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  So now they've really got the right medicine going into Brazil's educational system
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:36.000]  and saying that they're not going to put up with this idea that we need to train masculinity
[03:50:36.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  basic in a biological behavior out of boys.
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  Bolsonaro delivered the message while wearing a Japan soccer shirt asserting, quote,
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:49.000]  in Japan, kids of six, seven years can solve math problems.
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:57.000]  Our college students can't because here in Brazil, it's more important to teach a boy that he's not a boy and a girl that she's not a girl.
[03:50:57.000 --> 03:51:04.000]  So they're actually putting some seriously foundational, positive educational programs back into place in Brazil
[03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:07.000]  now that they've got a populist president.
[03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:13.000]  Meanwhile, in the UK, where acid attacks and knife machete attacks continue to rise.
[03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:18.000]  In fact, there was horrific footage again out of the train station in London the other day of a man
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:20.000]  attempting to carry out some kind of machete attack.
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  The police are busy visiting people again over questionable Facebook posts.
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:32.000]  Yes, our resources, our tax money being used very wisely indeed.
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:38.000]  Headline father visited by police after Facebook joke about feeding baby hot sauce.
[03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:47.000]  Now, if you didn't read this story, all you would have seen is the headlines about a father feeding his baby hot sauce.
[03:51:47.000 --> 03:51:51.000]  Now, because the initial reaction would be, that's a bit sick.
[03:51:51.000 --> 03:51:52.000]  That's a bit weird.
[03:51:52.000 --> 03:51:53.000]  Why would you feed a baby hot sauce?
[03:51:53.000 --> 03:51:55.000]  No, it was a joke.
[03:51:55.000 --> 03:51:58.000]  He posted on Facebook.
[03:51:58.000 --> 03:52:00.000]  Basically, they went to a restaurant.
[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:04.000]  He got a little tiny bit of hot sauce on his knuckle.
[03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:05.000]  He was playing with his baby.
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:08.000]  He put a little bit of his knuckle in his baby's mouth.
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:10.000]  The baby reacted a little bit.
[03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:16.000]  And then he later posted it on Facebook and said it was unintentional, by the way, lol.
[03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:18.000]  That was his quote.
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:27.000]  A few days later, Mr Dawson, the father was stunned when police knocked on his door to ask if he'd been feeding the baby hot sauce.
[03:52:27.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  So some little snitch saw his Facebook post called the police.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:34.000]  They turned up knocked on his door.
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:36.000]  He hasn't had an apology.
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:39.000]  I mean, thankfully, the police realized how ridiculous it was.
[03:52:39.000 --> 03:52:46.000]  But again, the very fact that they would be told to go there in the first place, while we've got actual violent crime rising across the board,
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  is indicative of the kind of tattletail snitch society with social media that we now live in.
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:53:00.000]  Meanwhile, in France, French police deploy rifles with live ammunition to yellow vest protests.
[03:53:00.000 --> 03:53:02.000]  And there's footage of this as well.
[03:53:02.000 --> 03:53:12.000]  French riot police are alleged to have begun deploying assault rifles with live ammunition for the first time during the ninth weekend of protest in a row by the Gilles Jaune yellow vest movement.
[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:21.000]  Now, of course, we've seen the videos of protesters literally having their eyes popped out, their hands blown off when they tried to pick up stun grenades.
[03:53:21.000 --> 03:53:31.000]  Now, French officers were caught on video brandishing what appeared to be Heckler and Colt G36 assault rifles on the streets of the French capital near the Arc de Triomphe on Saturday.
[03:53:31.000 --> 03:53:34.000]  And there's video of this as well in the article we posted.
[03:53:34.000 --> 03:53:39.000]  But again, it's a pure intimidation tactic to prevent more people going out on the streets.
[03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:42.000]  What in the hell are they doing?
[03:53:42.000 --> 03:53:46.000]  They trying to communicate the message that there could be some kind of massacre.
[03:53:46.000 --> 03:53:50.000]  Why have they got machine guns on the streets dealing with these protesters?
[03:53:50.000 --> 03:53:53.000]  Absolutely frightening prospect.
[03:53:53.000 --> 03:54:03.000]  And in fact, there's an interesting quote here from the former French Minister of Education, Luc Ferry, who seemingly endorsed the use of live ammunition on yellow vest protesters.
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:09.000]  He said, when you see guys beating up an unfortunate policeman on the ground, let them use their weapons once and for all that's enough.
[03:54:09.000 --> 03:54:17.000]  He basically said, quote, we have the fourth largest army in the world, and it's capable of putting an end to this crap.
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:27.000]  So he later walked that back. But in that quote, he's basically calling for martial law and for armed troops on the streets to deal with these yellow vest protesters.
[03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:36.000]  So there's no sign that that's going away as President Macron's approval rating slips lower and lower 23% at last count.
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:45.000]  Meanwhile, in Germany, Afghan migrant arrested after 87 year old woman brutally killed these stories come out on a daily basis.
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:47.000]  He can barely keep up with them.
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:54:50.000]  We had another one out of Austria about a different murder.
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:52.000]  Now there's another one after that about Austria.
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:54.000]  This one's out of Germany.
[03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  You just get confused because they just happen multiple times daily.
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:55:02.000]  Police in the German city of Jenner have arrested 23 year old asylum seeker from Afghanistan.
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:07.000]  Following the discovery of the body of an 87 year old German woman believed to have been murdered.
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:12.000]  Body of the pensioner was discovered Saturday morning in a cellar with police believing the woman had been murdered.
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:20.000]  An arrest warrant was drawn up on Sunday evening with police managing to arrest a 23 year old Afghan migrant who was a neighbor of the woman.
[03:55:20.000 --> 03:55:26.000]  Meanwhile, in Austria, Syrian man admits strangling 16 year old Austrian girl.
[03:55:26.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  He had allegedly been harassing the body of a teenager who was allegedly strangled was found in a park in the lower Austrian city of Vienna.
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:47.000]  Over the weekend, the suspect is reportedly her ex-boyfriend born in Syria in 1999. He'd been on police radar and suspicion of assaulting sexually harassing the girl but was able to keep his asylum status as they always are.
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:49.000]  None of them ever get deported.
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:53.000]  So again, we had the mass molestation of women in Cologne.
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:55:57.000]  Angela Merkel basically said she's going to continue the policy.
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:56:09.000]  All these other European countries are saying of importing hundreds of thousands of migrants per year from areas of the world which have no respect for women and betray that lack of respect on a regular basis.
[03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:21.000]  Now you saw the photo the other day of President Trump basically buying hamburgers and a bunch of fast food for the college football champions there, the Clemson Tigers.
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:29.000]  Well now CNN is upset because Trump made a joke about Melania Trump making a salad.
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:35.000]  Yes, really CNN host Aaron Burnett and analyst Joan Walsh have lambasted the US president.
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:47.000]  No doubt for his toxic masculinity about the first lady making quote little quick salads for the White House reception for the Clemson Tigers during a catering emergency while the kitchen staff is for load.
[03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:51.000]  So again, this is what she said, Joan Walsh, it's incredibly sexist.
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  He shouldn't talk about the first lady in that way.
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:55.000]  We aren't all here to make salads for men.
[03:56:55.000 --> 03:57:05.000]  So he jokes about her giving a helping hand putting out food for this Clemson Tigers football team and they're triggered beyond belief.
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:14.000]  They're also triggered by the fact in another story here CNN analyst accuses black Sirius XM host David Webb of white privilege.
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:20.000]  She said he had white privilege not knowing going into the interview that he, of course, was black.
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:22.000]  That is absolutely hilarious.
[03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:28.000]  You can go and read the quotes in that article on Breitbart, but that's going to wrap it up for this segment of the Alex Jones show.
[03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:34.000]  Coming up next is War Room with Owen Shroyer breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:35.000]  Don't go away.
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:46.000]  Defeat the globalist hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:57:46.000 --> 03:57:49.000]  Defeat the pedophiles hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:54.000]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:57:54.000 --> 03:57:58.000]  Defeat the sensors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:57:58.000 --> 03:58:04.000]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action
[03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:07.000]  with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:15.000]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the sensors now and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones,
[03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:17.000]  we are unstoppable together.
[03:58:17.000 --> 03:58:21.000]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[03:58:21.000 --> 03:58:27.000]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[03:58:27.000 --> 03:58:37.000]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones. That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:58:37.000 --> 03:58:44.000]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[03:58:44.000 --> 03:58:59.000]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punch-drunk to the censorship and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:58:59.000 --> 03:59:05.000]  In punishment that I beat a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us, your excitement about America,
[03:59:05.000 --> 03:59:09.000]  your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[03:59:09.000 --> 03:59:15.000]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:59:15.000 --> 03:59:23.000]  I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:59:23.000 --> 03:59:29.000]  I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen,
[03:59:29.000 --> 03:59:37.000]  but you've got to back us and I promise you this, I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will.
[03:59:37.000 --> 03:59:44.000]  I give you my commitment if you financially support us at FullWars4.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
