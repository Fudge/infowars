[00:00.000 --> 00:22.600]  Thank you for listening to GCA.
[00:22.600 --> 00:37.240]  Today, an LCRA official say the current drought could end 590 KLBJ.
[00:37.240 --> 00:42.360]  I am in USA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan. The nation's governors are bickering over the
[00:42.360 --> 00:47.640]  economic stimulus money designated for their states. Republican Haley Barber of Mississippi
[00:47.640 --> 00:53.440]  tells CNN he's thinking of rejecting a portion of the money. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal
[00:53.440 --> 00:58.440]  on NBC's Meet the Press says President Barack Obama signed a law, a bill that has a lot
[00:58.440 --> 01:03.240]  of wasteful spending. If he had worked with Republicans, instead of allowing Speaker Pelosi
[01:03.240 --> 01:06.960]  to write this bill, if he had worked with Republicans to say, let's really invest in
[01:06.960 --> 01:11.560]  infrastructure, let's do targeted temporary spending, let's do some tax cuts, let's get
[01:11.560 --> 01:15.040]  the economy moving, I don't think we're going to solve our economic challenges through
[01:15.040 --> 01:18.960]  government spending. And European leaders meeting in Berlin are backing sweeping new
[01:18.960 --> 01:24.160]  regulations for financial markets and hedge funds. A statement from German Chancellor
[01:24.160 --> 01:29.960]  Angela Merkel says the leaders agreed on seven key points during their one-day meeting.
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.880]  This is IRN USA Radio News. Men and women, if you've got 10 to 30 pounds or more to lose,
[01:35.880 --> 01:39.800]  please listen carefully. Guys, many of us tend to overeat. We eat too much red meat,
[01:39.800 --> 01:43.640]  fast foods and processed foods. This keeps the belly flabby and keeps our bodies overweight.
[01:43.640 --> 01:47.280]  Ladies, have you ever said, I feel fat today? Or do you have this bloated feeling? And how
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.800]  many of you have been trying to lose the same 10 to 20 pounds for years? There's a healthy
[01:50.800 --> 01:54.340]  and faster way to lose weight than any diet pill. It's called Evercleans, a clinically
[01:54.340 --> 01:57.880]  proven weight loss and detox formula that helps you lose weight and get rid of the five
[01:57.880 --> 02:01.920]  to 25 pounds of waste that some experts say is trapped to the colon walls like spackle
[02:01.920 --> 02:06.320]  or paste. Two weeks of Evercleans may be equal to months of dieting. It's simple too. Natural,
[02:06.320 --> 02:09.320]  tasteless crystals that dissolve in any food or beverage. Evercleans will flatten out your
[02:09.320 --> 02:12.960]  midsection, reduce love handles, and bellies and bloating have been disappearing in just
[02:12.960 --> 02:16.240]  a few days. You see, Evercleans gets rid of the weight you can't take off by exercising
[02:16.240 --> 02:19.120]  or starving yourself on a diet. And it's not something you have to take for the rest
[02:19.120 --> 02:23.280]  of your life. Visit us at evercleans.com or call now to receive a very special offer.

[02:33.960 --> 02:40.080]  A once reviled, now revered British reality TV star has tied the knot with her fiance.
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.960]  The wedding has drawn much attention in Britain because 27-year-old Jane Goody is dying of
[02:44.960 --> 02:51.000]  cancer. A spokesman says it was a very beautiful, very moving service. Charles De La Desma
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.960]  has more on the intense interest. Police, media, and well-wishers all gathered at the
[02:55.960 --> 03:01.240]  entrance to the Down Hall Country House Hotel, while a plane flew overhead, trading a banner
[03:01.240 --> 03:05.920]  emblazoned with the couple's names. A movie of the wedding will be produced by Kate Jackson,
[03:05.920 --> 03:09.680]  who is also one of the four bridesmaids. In Pakistan, the government in the troubled
[03:09.680 --> 03:14.920]  Northwest says it will set up village militias and arm them to help counter terrorism. A
[03:14.920 --> 03:19.360]  province official says the militias will help police in the region, which is under increasing
[03:19.360 --> 03:23.920]  threat from Taliban militants. And Chinese state media say the search for victims has
[03:23.920 --> 03:29.000]  ended after a gas explosion ripped through a coal mine in northern China. For more news

[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  to worry about money again. Hi, how in the world are you anyway? This is Andy Willoughby,
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.040]  speaking for the Three Step Plan. The Three Step Plan is a business system designed to
[03:45.040 --> 03:49.560]  help families start their own home-based business. If you like working with people with similar
[03:49.560 --> 03:58.560]  family values, you'll love the Three Step Plan. Go to threestepplan.com or call 800-658-0459.
[03:58.560 --> 04:08.840]  Authorities in Southeastern Pennsylvania say seven school buses have been severely damaged
[04:08.840 --> 04:15.040]  by fires that were deliberately set. It happened early today in West Brandywine Township, which
[04:15.040 --> 04:22.400]  is just north of a town that has seen 66 arson fires since January 2008. John Hageman is
[04:22.400 --> 04:29.120]  with the ATF. The school bus fires are just two miles from Coatesville, so we're certainly
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.360]  looking into the possibility that they are related, but it's still too early to say that
[04:33.360 --> 04:37.640]  they are. Acknowledging that American families and small businesses are hurting, Republicans
[04:37.640 --> 04:42.840]  Saturday attacked the Democrat-sponsored spending bill that recently passed Congress. Michigan
[04:42.840 --> 04:47.960]  Congressman Dave Camp talks about the Republicans' economic plan. House Republicans offered a
[04:47.960 --> 04:55.160]  plan to help our economy using fast-acting tax relief that would have created 6.2 million
[04:55.160 --> 05:00.680]  jobs, twice the jobs, at half the cost of the Democrats' trillion-dollar government
[05:00.680 --> 05:06.040]  spending bill. And in President Obama's weekly radio address, he talked of his wide-ranging
[05:06.040 --> 05:11.640]  economic recovery plan. He says his housing plan will help stem the tide of foreclosures.
[05:11.640 --> 05:16.440]  It is only a first step on the road to economic recovery, and we can't fail to complete the
[05:16.440 --> 05:21.280]  journey. That will require stemming the spread of foreclosures and falling home values, and
[05:21.280 --> 05:26.160]  doing all we can to help responsible homeowners stay in their homes, which is exactly what
[05:26.160 --> 05:31.560]  the housing plan I announced last week will help us do. I'm Jody Jordan for IRN-USA Radio
[05:31.560 --> 05:33.360]  News.
[05:33.360 --> 05:38.320]  Cue companies continue to lay off thousands of people. Unemployment is the highest it's
[05:38.320 --> 05:44.400]  been in over 30 years. Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up. Everyone
[05:44.400 --> 05:49.720]  needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying
[05:49.720 --> 05:50.720]  times.

[07:08.560 --> 07:09.560]  Jones.
[07:09.560 --> 07:18.880]  It is the 22nd day of February 2009. We're going to be here for the next two hours live.
[07:18.880 --> 07:24.960]  Before joining us, I get this question emailed to me every day when I'm on other radio talk
[07:24.960 --> 07:30.840]  shows or on television. People ask me this question over and over again. They say, Alex,
[07:30.840 --> 07:37.240]  why are you so negative? Alex, why are you saying things are so bad? Why don't you just
[07:37.240 --> 07:38.240]  be positive?
[07:38.240 --> 07:43.400]  Well, if you go into the doctor and they tell you you've got a huge brain tumor on the CAT
[07:43.400 --> 07:50.080]  scan, but the good news is it's easily operable and you'll be fine after a week's stay in
[07:50.080 --> 07:52.080]  the hospital.
[07:52.080 --> 07:57.040]  You just say, doctor, I think you're a conspiracy theorist. I don't like to hear that type of
[07:57.040 --> 08:03.240]  bad news. You go home and a few months later the tumor grows on your brain stem and suddenly
[08:03.240 --> 08:08.080]  you can't walk. You go back to the doctor and you say, okay, I guess it's true. I guess
[08:08.080 --> 08:12.320]  I do have this brain tumor. They say, sorry, it's too late. It's eaten into the brain
[08:12.320 --> 08:17.200]  stem. We may be able to save you, but you're going to be paralyzed from the neck down. In
[08:17.200 --> 08:21.560]  fact, I've seen real cases of that. People are in denial.
[08:21.560 --> 08:27.120]  Now, I'm very positive about the fact that this nation has a giant brain tumor. That's
[08:27.120 --> 08:31.800]  the federal government and that throughout the body of the country, the states, we have
[08:31.800 --> 08:36.160]  hundreds of other tumors. Now, I'm going to be honest with you. A lot of you didn't listen
[08:36.160 --> 08:40.560]  and you made jokes and laughed about it. It's fun to be a yuppie and snicker and feel powerful
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.040]  or it's funny to be a mainline right wing person and think everything's okay and it's
[08:45.040 --> 08:51.080]  fun to be a mainline liberal and the nation will probably go ahead and fall apart into
[08:51.080 --> 08:57.080]  the North American Union and will be like Mexico slash North Korea with a sprinkling
[08:57.080 --> 09:02.120]  of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. And that's what you wanted. That's what you demanded.
[09:02.120 --> 09:05.800]  That's what you needed. You know, you could have had the tumors removed when they were
[09:05.800 --> 09:12.040]  very small, but we do have a chance to remove them. But only if people finally wake up and
[09:12.040 --> 09:18.240]  get involved and educate yourselves very, very quickly. If you don't do that, we're
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.120]  in deep trouble. So no, I'm a very positive person. That'd be like if I saw my neighbor's
[09:23.120 --> 09:28.200]  house on fire and I went and bang on the door and said, Bob, come out your, your home's
[09:28.200 --> 09:32.160]  on fire and he walked up the door and said, Alex, I don't want to hear from you. You're
[09:32.160 --> 09:35.960]  just being negative. And I said, look, flames are shooting out of the top. There's smoke
[09:35.960 --> 09:41.840]  coming out and he says, Alex, you're a conspiracy theorist. I'm going to have a positive outlook
[09:41.840 --> 09:46.440]  on things. And then Bob or Bill goes back in and the house collapses on top of him and
[09:46.440 --> 09:53.680]  his family. I mean, that's how ridiculous this is. The truth is, I've done my homework.
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.560]  The truth is, I'm right about 99% of what I say. Occasionally, I make an error. Normally,
[09:59.560 --> 10:04.080]  I underestimate how bad things are.
[10:04.080 --> 10:06.760]  So today I'm going to go over a lot of the important news, but I'm also just going to
[10:06.760 --> 10:13.160]  boil down the basics of what we face as a society. And we're going to be taking your
[10:13.160 --> 10:25.160]  phone calls as well. The toll free number to join us is 877-590-5525-877-590-5525. We're
[10:25.160 --> 10:33.600]  visiting Central Texas from the station that the syndication originates out of. It is 836-0590.
[10:33.600 --> 10:43.480]  Okay, I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight stacks of news. I could spin
[10:43.480 --> 10:46.720]  the entire show and any one of these and go into great detail and prove every claim I'm
[10:46.720 --> 10:53.160]  making, but we don't have time. I suggest you check into these stories yourself. Drug
[10:53.160 --> 10:59.920]  violence spins Mexico towards civil war CNN. El Paso Times reports FEMA and Homeland Security
[10:59.920 --> 11:05.440]  are preparing to seal the border for martial law in South Texas. I tell people, this isn't
[11:05.440 --> 11:11.080]  an email, so then I'm a conspiracy theorist. Hey, whatever makes you happy, okay? I told
[11:11.080 --> 11:15.200]  you that Bank of America and others weren't safe a year ago and you laughed at me. Now
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.800]  they're talking about them collapsing. Look, I just give you the facts. I'm sorry if it
[11:20.800 --> 11:26.400]  isn't what you want to hear. This is not magical thinking. This is not Harry Potter world.
[11:26.400 --> 11:34.440]  This is reality. As crime mounts, Mexicans turn to vigilante justice this out of Time
[11:34.440 --> 11:41.280]  magazine and it shows all these images of machine gun dead police and military. Brazilian
[11:41.280 --> 11:45.880]  Brzezinski fears class warfare and the destruction of the new world order. That's a quote from
[11:45.880 --> 11:55.240]  MSNBC and we have a link to it up on info wars.com. So we'll be going over that report. Also,
[11:55.240 --> 11:58.200]  you know the army and the Marines have openly announced they're going to patrol the United
[11:58.200 --> 12:03.600]  States and are training for gun confiscation. Again, decade plus after I told you they were
[12:03.600 --> 12:10.440]  doing that secretly. But it was in the Daily Times, Harold out of Carroll, Iowa. They're
[12:10.440 --> 12:14.800]  going to practice locking the town down a real town, go door to door asking about people's
[12:14.800 --> 12:23.360]  firearms. And I had the colonel, the head spokesman on Friday discussing it with him.
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.280]  And then we got a call back from the mayor and a call back from the army saying, Mr.
[12:27.280 --> 12:32.040]  Jones, don't worry, the drill has been canceled. And I looked at my producer and I said that's
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.760]  a lie. They will announce by the end of the weekend. The press release has been scaled
[12:36.760 --> 12:42.280]  back. Guess what the Associated Press and several other publications. We have a story
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.960]  up on info wars.com that her name I did boil down linking to them. They said they're not
[12:46.960 --> 12:52.360]  canceling it. They're, they're, they're cutting it down because folks, I know these people.
[12:52.360 --> 12:59.800]  I know them like the back of my hand. All they do is lie. Lying is their job. North
[12:59.800 --> 13:05.560]  com is over the United States. We are an occupied country. The US military openly works for
[13:05.560 --> 13:12.200]  offshore banks now. They're doing nothing but running military operations against us
[13:12.200 --> 13:23.000]  period. Okay. They will lie to you every single time. Now, I guess I'm not supposed to tell
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.440]  the truth. I'm just go, well, I need to be pro military. Just accept the law. It's good
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.600]  to be lied to, you know, that's how we stay free. If you call Mexico freedom or North
[13:32.600 --> 13:37.760]  Korea freedom, you see, when a government goes bad, everything falls apart and the criminal
[13:37.760 --> 13:44.720]  steal everything and confidence is lost and the society falls apart for 99% of people.
[13:44.720 --> 13:50.480]  And then in every case, the criminals that bring down the nation, they go retire in Switzerland
[13:50.480 --> 13:54.880]  or they go retire in the Bahamas or one of the favorite places they go retire in Portugal
[13:54.880 --> 14:02.320]  or Spain or the Cook Islands. That's where they all go. And see, they don't care about
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.840]  your 401ks. They don't care about your future. They don't care about the red, white and blue.
[14:06.840 --> 14:12.240]  They don't care and they got control of this country and they've now used up our credit
[14:12.240 --> 14:16.520]  and bought up the world with it and they're done with us and they're leaving a rear guard
[14:16.520 --> 14:21.000]  because they're still scared of the American people of North com and the Marines and the
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.040]  army to make sure that their getaway is safe when they turn this country to a third world
[14:26.040 --> 14:33.120]  nation. And when you realize they've stolen everything by design, you understand that
[14:33.120 --> 14:38.040]  that's what the military and the police and the black mask and the cameras are for. Now,
[14:38.040 --> 14:43.000]  none of this is my opinion. Remember, I'm the guy that wrote a book in 2002 called the
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.160]  sent into tyranny that said all of this would happen and even name the year it was going
[14:47.160 --> 14:51.640]  to happen. Wasn't hard. I have the IMF and World Bank documents. Again, none of this
[14:51.640 --> 14:59.080]  is hard. That's what's so ridiculous about all of this. You know, I was on a talk show
[14:59.080 --> 15:06.200]  station in San Francisco, a big station. Forget the call letters yesterday and they're picking
[15:06.200 --> 15:10.640]  up a show. They've been carrying it last week and got a great response. But the guy was
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.360]  reading me emails on air of people that still say I'm a cook and they're like, this Alex
[15:14.360 --> 15:21.400]  Jones is a nut. This Alex Jones makes up an imaginary new world order. And then today
[15:21.400 --> 15:27.200]  I was walking out of my office and I looked at a stack for the Obama deception. I'm finishing
[15:27.200 --> 15:33.200]  up the next few days. And it was a stack of over 30 mainstream news articles that I just
[15:33.200 --> 15:36.720]  printed off the last two weeks and there's hundreds of them every week. I just, this
[15:36.720 --> 15:40.800]  is something I printed for the film and I gave to the graphics guide. I had to get shots
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.920]  of and put in the film. And there it was. I started reading over them. You know, every
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.960]  day it's a big New Brzezinski and Obama's people and the Republicans and all these leaders
[15:52.960 --> 15:57.440]  calling for world government saying we'll have a new bank of the world that will pay
[15:57.440 --> 16:03.040]  carbon taxes too. And they're announcing all of it and it doesn't matter if I've got
[16:03.040 --> 16:08.040]  Wall Street Journal, Newsweek Time, Financial Times of London, Times of London, Associated
[16:08.040 --> 16:12.120]  Press, MSNBC, Reuters. I mean, that's what I've got. It doesn't matter. They just say
[16:12.120 --> 16:16.920]  it doesn't exist, Alex. No, you're still wrong. It's not happening. And people write
[16:16.920 --> 16:21.200]  articles attacking me saying it's not happening. I mean, do you suckers that think you're part
[16:21.200 --> 16:24.880]  of the establishment really think you're going to make it through all this and that you're
[16:24.880 --> 16:28.880]  going to be on the winning team? You're with the people. You've got to be lying. There's

[17:36.680 --> 17:42.600]  wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[17:42.600 --> 17:47.760]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still the
[17:47.760 --> 17:53.600]  financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[17:53.600 --> 17:59.760]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs,
[17:59.760 --> 18:04.880]  yet no word about IRAs. Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your
[18:04.880 --> 18:10.040]  assets by keeping you in paper. If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement,
[18:10.040 --> 18:16.120]  call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your
[18:16.120 --> 18:26.440]  paper investments. Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237.

[20:43.880 --> 20:49.360]  That's right. It's syndicated. I've done this show on about 40 stations now. The Sunday
[20:49.360 --> 20:57.320]  show, the weekday show is above 70, growing again quite a bit, and big stations. Big stations
[20:57.320 --> 21:00.880]  are turning us on. I talked to these station owners and they're like, I didn't believe
[21:00.880 --> 21:05.440]  you years ago that it all came true. I've got all the mainstream newspapers here saying
[21:05.440 --> 21:10.400]  world government's going to save us from the banking crisis. That's exactly what you said.
[21:10.400 --> 21:14.880]  I heard you as a guest on my station seven years ago say that they were going to implode
[21:14.880 --> 21:19.360]  the banking system through derivatives and then announce a new plan to re-monetize the
[21:19.360 --> 21:24.800]  world through a private central bank that would control the United States with carbon
[21:24.800 --> 21:30.160]  taxes. Well, of course, I was reading the Council on Foreign Relations public plan.
[21:30.160 --> 21:39.040]  I mean, folks, I've used the analogy of, if my wife tells me, hey, Monday night football
[21:39.040 --> 21:42.440]  is coming on the night, you want to come home early and watch the game, and I say, and I
[21:42.440 --> 21:45.840]  come home and it comes on, and I say, how did you know Monday night football was going
[21:45.840 --> 21:53.400]  to come on? How are you psychic? How did you know? She's like, no, it's in the TV guide.
[21:53.400 --> 21:57.560]  I mean, this is openly what the U.N. has always said. This is openly what the big central
[21:57.560 --> 22:01.880]  banks have been working towards, setting us up to do this. And now it's happening, but
[22:01.880 --> 22:08.240]  so many people invested in saying that I and many others like me were a liar and were liars
[22:08.240 --> 22:15.080]  that now, even though it's all happening, there's a minority of people that still cling
[22:15.080 --> 22:20.920]  to the old propaganda that none of this exists and that it's all a conspiracy theory.
[22:20.920 --> 22:26.920]  All right, here is some of the news. A guardsman to conduct urban training in Arcadia in April.
[22:26.920 --> 22:32.120]  I'm going to go into that drug violence spins Mexico towards civil war, rosinski sphere
[22:32.120 --> 22:38.480]  class warfare and the destruction of the new world order MSNBC. And he says on the piece,
[22:38.480 --> 22:42.680]  I'm afraid the people are going to revolt against the bankers. I thought international
[22:42.680 --> 22:50.200]  bankers didn't exist. I thought everything was fine. Look at this story AP transportation
[22:50.200 --> 22:56.800]  secretary says taxing how much we drive may replace gasoline tax. I remember being on
[22:56.800 --> 23:01.400]  countless radio interviews on other people's shows with them making fun of me. They'd say,
[23:01.400 --> 23:04.480]  oh, what's going to happen in the future? And I said, well, they're going to tax you
[23:04.480 --> 23:09.160]  by the mile with license plate reading cameras and transponder boxes and satellite boxes
[23:09.160 --> 23:14.240]  in your car. And I had that from the transportation department over a decade ago and they just
[23:14.240 --> 23:22.400]  laugh. It's so funny. It's so funny. Folks, you're going to be paying like France when
[23:22.400 --> 23:27.560]  they're done 80% taxes in one form or another. That's openly what the OECD and the international
[23:27.560 --> 23:34.040]  bank of settlements have said their goal is. And it's going to be going to interest on
[23:34.040 --> 23:38.880]  debt to private banks that made the money out of nothing. Here's another one. They're
[23:38.880 --> 23:42.600]  announcing all over the country in USA today. They're putting in body scanners where you
[23:42.600 --> 23:47.320]  walk in and it scans your naked body and puts it in a database, but they don't tell you
[23:47.320 --> 23:52.960]  is these airport scanners are to get a biometric read of your entire body so that their street
[23:52.960 --> 23:59.960]  corner cameras have your body's digital algorithm and can track everywhere you go with instant
[23:59.960 --> 24:05.160]  ID. And I have a CNN article here. You can go up to infowars.com if you want and click
[24:05.160 --> 24:09.040]  through and watch the video itself. It's also up on prisonplanet.com. We have a link to
[24:09.040 --> 24:16.400]  it on the CNN side of the sub page. It's actually a YouTube clip of CNN. What I told you, I'm
[24:16.400 --> 24:19.960]  not saying I told you, I told you, but we did tell you and you keep laughing and there's
[24:19.960 --> 24:23.640]  not time for that anymore. Okay. Just admit we're right and then decide what you're going
[24:23.640 --> 24:25.800]  to do about it. I'm not even telling you what to do about this. I'm just saying, will you
[24:25.800 --> 24:30.600]  please wake up? Remember minority report that came out, I don't know, five, six years ago
[24:30.600 --> 24:34.440]  where they face scan you everywhere you go and then the little billboards and malls and
[24:34.440 --> 24:39.440]  on the street. It also tracks where you go when they're after Tom Cruise, the cop that's
[24:39.440 --> 24:45.200]  gone rogue. They use it to track him. Well, see, that was already developed and patented
[24:45.200 --> 24:50.880]  more than 20 years ago. And about eight years ago, I was at the UT psychology department
[24:50.880 --> 24:56.560]  funded by DARPA and saw them. This was the unclassified areas I was allowed to see setting
[24:56.560 --> 25:01.280]  up these facial recognition systems. And what they do is they buy from the States, your
[25:01.280 --> 25:05.680]  digital photo. And then with that, they track everywhere you go on the street and in the
[25:05.680 --> 25:11.440]  malls. And so if you see minority report, that's really minus the precogs, what life
[25:11.440 --> 25:18.480]  is now like. So there's that report there for you. I always told folks because the UN
[25:18.480 --> 25:23.360]  and the IMF and the World Bank and the Club of Rome and the CFR and the trilateral commission
[25:23.360 --> 25:28.560]  said this was their plan. They even laugh and say global warming is a fraud and giggle
[25:28.560 --> 25:32.520]  and snicker that the public can be scared of carbon dioxide that plants breathe. That's
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.440]  one of the four life giving elements on earth, sunshine, water, carbon dioxide and oxygen.
[25:37.440 --> 25:40.960]  They even laugh at us. It's very funny to them. And in a way it is funny if it wasn't
[25:40.960 --> 25:45.560]  because of sick. So I'd have all these world leaders on the show and I'd say, well, you're
[25:45.560 --> 25:50.840]  planning these carbon, you know, restrictions to tax people. They'd say, that's ridiculous.
[25:50.840 --> 25:55.120]  I have that in the end game. The Rothschild heir was on the show. It was going, that's
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.760]  ridiculous. There's no plan to tax. And I'm like, but it's in all your documents. Oh,
[25:59.760 --> 26:05.640]  rubbish. I mean, we ought to play that clip. It's all over the news now. They're announcing
[26:05.640 --> 26:09.480]  the budget shortfall. In fact, Summer Singh, he's going to talk about it tomorrow night
[26:09.480 --> 26:15.240]  in his speech. The feds already have put it out, but that Obama is EPA expected to act
[26:15.240 --> 26:21.320]  in regulating carbon dioxide, Harold Tribune. And there's, I mean, just Google carbon tax
[26:21.320 --> 26:26.960]  called for it. All these senators and committee chairman and folks. It is last night I was
[26:26.960 --> 26:31.200]  doing a voiceover for the Obama deception. So I was going back over my research of what
[26:31.200 --> 26:37.520]  they're going to tax. They're going to tax all natural gas, all oil, asphalt, all plastics.
[26:37.520 --> 26:42.800]  They're going to tax having a fireplace or a wood burning stove or an outdoor propane
[26:42.800 --> 26:47.520]  space heater. They're going to tax trash pickup federally and internationally on top of your
[26:47.520 --> 26:53.800]  local taxes. They're going to tax cattle when they're produced pigs, sheep, goats, chickens,
[26:53.800 --> 26:59.400]  all meat will be taxed when it's produced. And on the dinner table, just Google beef
[26:59.400 --> 27:03.840]  tax. That's now about to be passed. The feds are bushing it. They're going to tax everything
[27:03.840 --> 27:07.200]  there. They're going to tax water. They're going to tax your home. They're going to tax
[27:07.200 --> 27:12.280]  your light bulbs, your toilets. There are thousands of taxes in the voiceover. I say
[27:12.280 --> 27:15.920]  over a hundred because people just can't believe that. I mean, actually, people accuse me of
[27:15.920 --> 27:20.360]  exaggerating. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I limit it because I know people can't
[27:20.360 --> 27:25.760]  handle that thousands, but just get ready. I know. Laugh now. Suck your thumb now. It's
[27:25.760 --> 27:31.400]  so much fun. Just keep being delusional. You know, I told you that the bailout bill wasn't
[27:31.400 --> 27:35.960]  $800 billion or $700 billion. I told you it was over nine trillion so far. And now Bloomberg
[27:35.960 --> 27:40.080]  and AP have come out with the latest numbers, 9.7 trillion. Just Google bail out now, 9.7
[27:40.080 --> 27:43.440]  trillion. And then they admit in that one article alone that they've spent the money
[27:43.440 --> 27:48.360]  and they're bragging in their corporate documents that, oh, our banks are very healthy. We're
[27:48.360 --> 27:52.640]  just blowing out some, you know, dummy corporation fronts. We're buying up healthy banks and
[27:52.640 --> 27:57.720]  insurance companies and we'll keep terrorizing the public telling them, give us this new
[27:57.720 --> 28:02.440]  power. Give us that new power. Do whatever we say or the economy will die. Anyway, we
[28:02.440 --> 28:06.400]  do whatever they say. Oh, yes, master. Oh, yes. Oh, whatever you want. Just save me.
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.280]  Just save me. I know it's not conservative, but socialism's only thing will save my 401
[28:11.280 --> 28:21.280]  K. So I guess I got to go with it. This isn't socialism. The 800 billion, if you want to
[28:21.280 --> 28:29.240]  get technical, it's $787 billion there. There's the exact number. The $787 billion stimulus
[28:29.240 --> 28:34.720]  plan they passed last week. What did that do? What did that do? Well, it did something
[28:34.720 --> 28:39.360]  a horrid. It further federalized the states and now the bill's been analyzed and most
[28:39.360 --> 28:45.240]  of the quote free federal money they took from the states, the feds give them 20% of
[28:45.240 --> 28:49.520]  the money. Some's 30, some's 40, but on average it's about 20% of the money. This is all over
[28:49.520 --> 28:54.360]  the news now. You can pull it up yourself and then the states have to pay for the 80%.
[28:54.360 --> 29:02.040]  It's an unfunded mandate. So more taxes, more control and just federal databases on health
[29:02.040 --> 29:07.080]  care, rationing of health care is in there. That was been in the mainstream news, but
[29:07.080 --> 29:13.400]  telling you how great it is. I mean, they are hitting us at every angle. This is a revolution.
[29:13.400 --> 29:17.560]  Private offshore banks have come in, taken over the nation. They bankrupted things on
[29:17.560 --> 29:22.960]  purpose for a fire sale so they can consolidate wealth while secondarily terrorizing the public
[29:22.960 --> 29:26.840]  and the Congress into handing over all their authority because the bankers with a gun to
[29:26.840 --> 29:31.120]  our head say, do what we say and everything will be okay, but then things only get worse.

[32:35.800 --> 32:41.640]  Welcome to America. It's time for change. The new president is talking about change.
[32:41.640 --> 32:47.440]  Are you talking about change? You know, changing your lifestyle to become more healthy? Well,
[32:47.440 --> 32:53.760]  here's how the staff at Life Change T feels. Make the change to be healthy before your
[32:53.760 --> 33:01.680]  body forces you to change. Organ failure, sickness, chemical poisoning, toxins, and
[33:01.680 --> 33:07.880]  much more. They'll force you to change for the worse. But willing change is much better
[33:07.880 --> 33:20.560]  than a change by force. Call Life Change T now at 928-308-0408 or you can order online

[33:27.800 --> 33:34.800]  T. Oh, and PS, you'll lose some weight.
[33:57.800 --> 34:01.280]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment. I'm going to get more into
[34:01.280 --> 34:06.160]  the collapse of Mexico, what that means to the U.S., what big financial institutions
[34:06.160 --> 34:10.160]  are going to be going under part of the staged event, and then their future and a lot more
[34:10.160 --> 34:17.320]  today. But also, I wanted to get into some of Obama's latest lies. I mean, there's so
[34:17.320 --> 34:23.280]  many. It's hard to even stay abreast of all the new ones. But I was with an independent
[34:23.280 --> 34:28.560]  film channel crew and there was also an Australian national TV crew at the same time down here
[34:28.560 --> 34:34.480]  Thursday and Friday. So Thursday night, I said, let's go down and talk to Obama supporters
[34:34.480 --> 34:39.800]  or the public period down on 6th Street. So we went down there about 8 o'clock at night
[34:39.800 --> 34:44.200]  and I'd walk up to the Obama supporters and I'd say, so do you support Obama? Oh, yes,
[34:44.200 --> 34:47.600]  I love him. And I'd say, okay, well, he lied. He said he was going to bring all the troops
[34:47.600 --> 34:51.920]  home from Iraq, but he's actually increasing over all troops overseas and saying now they're
[34:51.920 --> 34:55.960]  going to stay in Iraq for at least 23 more months before they even look at it. And they
[34:55.960 --> 34:59.920]  said, yeah, well, he had to say that to get elected. See, now they feel like they're part
[34:59.920 --> 35:05.640]  of the power structure and Obama's their guy and they're part of the system and they've
[35:05.640 --> 35:10.800]  got to place the table. So it's okay that he lied about that. And I said, well, he's
[35:10.800 --> 35:14.360]  continuing actually their rendition. He's at the secret arrest. They're just looking
[35:14.360 --> 35:19.360]  at closing Guantanamo Bay, but it's only one of hundreds of camps. And they said, well,
[35:19.360 --> 35:22.240]  yeah, but you got to do that in the war on terror. So suddenly these are George Bush
[35:22.240 --> 35:26.600]  supporters buying the whole lie. And I said, well, he promised not to appoint any lobbyists,
[35:26.600 --> 35:30.600]  but that's all it seems. He's appointing his big lobbyist and donors to powerful positions
[35:30.600 --> 35:34.720]  in government. And they said, yeah, well, you know, those are the people he needs to
[35:34.720 --> 35:39.000]  get the job done. And I just started going in the line. I said, well, he said they had
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.960]  to pass the stimulus bill without reading it. But then he went on vacation for four days.
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.080]  He really didn't want people reading it. And he promised that he wouldn't do that in the
[35:48.080 --> 35:53.760]  future. And they said, yeah, well, you know, we got to give him time, time. This guy's
[35:53.760 --> 35:58.600]  and everything Bush did, but put it on steroids. Well, here's the latest Obama backs Bush.
[35:58.600 --> 36:05.200]  This is AP Obama backs Bush, no rights for Bob Graham prisoners. Now this is the real
[36:05.200 --> 36:10.160]  camp. This is where they pick up first, pick them up and then end up killing a lot of them.
[36:10.160 --> 36:14.520]  People have been beaten to death and murdered there by the thousands. I mean, they've had
[36:14.520 --> 36:19.240]  cases admitted where they'll put in one case, 3000 plus people in tiny containers for a
[36:19.240 --> 36:24.000]  week without food or water, where they couldn't even sit down like cattle cars in Nazi Germany.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.360]  And then a week later, they just pull all the dead bodies out. You can Google that story.
[36:28.360 --> 36:35.040]  It's mainstream news. Never forget, uh, there was a gruckheimer, Sergeant gruckheimer in
[36:35.040 --> 36:39.240]  the Ithaca news, talking about how they just go in villages and kill everyone, including
[36:39.240 --> 36:42.600]  children. And the Pentagon came out on Fox News and said, well, we want to clarify. We
[36:42.600 --> 36:48.520]  only kill everybody in certain villages. The Obama administration, siding with the Bush
[36:48.520 --> 36:53.840]  White House contended Friday that detainees in Afghanistan have no constitutional rights.
[36:53.840 --> 36:57.680]  And that went further. No Geneva rights, no international treaty rights and see then our
[36:57.680 --> 37:01.200]  troops don't have any rights when they get captured. But see, this is meant to terrorize
[37:01.200 --> 37:07.800]  anybody. If any government or any group or any sovereign group, you know, it was the
[37:07.800 --> 37:11.720]  precious Afghans fighting the Ruskies in the 80s. Well, now they want the U S out and they
[37:11.720 --> 37:16.360]  just call them al-Qaeda. No such thing. That's a CIA front group. And so they let them know,
[37:16.360 --> 37:19.460]  hey, we're going to torture you to death. If you fight us, see, it's a, it's a form
[37:19.460 --> 37:23.680]  of terror. The Nazis would do that in Russia and in Europe when they were taking over areas,
[37:23.680 --> 37:26.840]  they would kill and torture people to death, letting them know if you fight back in any
[37:26.840 --> 37:31.640]  way, we torture you to death. But see, it was babble. The Nazis did it good when the
[37:31.640 --> 37:36.200]  good old U S survey does it, but it's not even our military anymore. And when Pat Tillman
[37:36.200 --> 37:39.840]  started writing letters home saying this whole war is a fraud, all we're doing is guarding
[37:39.840 --> 37:44.440]  poppy fields over here. Boy, they fragged him quick, didn't they? And I've talked to
[37:44.440 --> 37:49.120]  his family. They killed him down in the hammer. That was a Pentagon assassination. Oh, yeah,
[37:49.120 --> 37:56.840]  football player. You're useful to them. You're useful to the system as long as you play ball.
[37:56.840 --> 38:01.960]  But the minute you don't go along the propaganda, you die. You think the globalists just kill
[38:01.960 --> 38:05.880]  people and break things in other nations? They think nothing of our lives as well. They've
[38:05.880 --> 38:09.400]  conquered this country. And until we wake up to that and speak out against them, it's
[38:09.400 --> 38:15.600]  going to get worse. So Obama backs Bush and no rights for background prisoners in a two
[38:15.600 --> 38:19.400]  sentence court filing. The Justice Department said a degree that detainees at background
[38:19.400 --> 38:23.960]  airfield cannot use U S courts to challenge their detention. The filing shocked human
[38:23.960 --> 38:28.760]  rights attorneys because Obama promised to reverse that. You know, I mean, if you got
[38:28.760 --> 38:34.800]  the proof on these people, show it in court, but see, they can't do that because even the
[38:34.800 --> 38:40.280]  CIA section chief that wrote the book, Jawbreaker, I interviewed him, admitted they don't pick
[38:40.280 --> 38:44.480]  up any real Taliban or Al Qaeda. What they do is they just grab 14 year old goat herders
[38:44.480 --> 38:53.200]  and they pay the Taliban a $25,000. They pay them a $25,000. I mean, literally they go
[38:53.200 --> 38:56.600]  up in the hills and they pick up the goat herders up in the mountains. Many of them who've never
[38:56.600 --> 39:01.160]  even heard of America that literally it's that primitive and they go up there and they
[39:01.160 --> 39:09.120]  grab them and they put them in camps and then the Taliban is paid $25,000 a piece and the
[39:09.120 --> 39:15.880]  news advertised that they've captured Al Qaeda. Absolutely incredible. The hope we all had
[39:15.880 --> 39:21.560]  in President Obama to lead us on a different path has not turned out as we'd hoped, said
[39:21.560 --> 39:27.720]  Tina. Mon's for fear foster a human rights attorney representing a detainee at the background
[39:27.720 --> 39:31.560]  of Merrifield. We all expected better. The Supreme Court last year gave Al Qaeda and
[39:31.560 --> 39:35.320]  Taliban suspects held at U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo, Cuba the right to challenge her
[39:35.320 --> 39:40.600]  detention. Oh, but Obama says he's not going with that. He's going with the most extreme
[39:40.600 --> 39:46.600]  interpretation of the Bush administration. But then meanwhile, they've got to have a
[39:46.600 --> 39:52.400]  nice little PR story to save the public. So they put out this piece of propaganda in the
[39:52.400 --> 39:59.440]  Communist News Service, CNN, Abu Ghraib, but now a humane prison Iraq officials say, though
[39:59.440 --> 40:06.160]  they wouldn't allow a tour of the facility that was holding prisoners. Now, I saw reports
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.200]  a month ago that they have secret prisons all over Iraq where they without a trial just
[40:10.200 --> 40:18.800]  shoot or hang people. So see, they just moved out of the Abu Ghraib and moved down the road.
[40:18.800 --> 40:27.000]  They have PR pieces for the American people. It says the notorious Iraq prison once called
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.160]  Abu Ghraib has reopened under Iraq government control and the Ministry of Justice has launched
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.600]  a public relations campaign to show it has changed since the days when prisoners were
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.480]  tortured there first under Saddam Hussein and later by American troops. It's now called
[40:41.480 --> 40:46.560]  Baghdad Central Prison and has water fountains and freshly painted garden and a gym complete
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.840]  with weights and sports teams and jerseys on the walls. But it goes on to say that they
[40:50.840 --> 40:55.960]  were not allowed to actually see any of that of the prisoners. So that's funny, unless
[40:55.960 --> 41:03.320]  you're one of the people in the torture camp. I mean, this is sick, folks. This is so completely
[41:03.320 --> 41:11.960]  and totally sick. It just boggles the mind that it's but my wife listens to MPR when
[41:11.960 --> 41:19.040]  she's cooking breakfast or lunch or dinner. So it's on in the background. And she's always
[41:19.040 --> 41:23.640]  scoffing at the propaganda, but they just repeat over and over again. Barack Obama
[41:23.640 --> 41:30.040]  has closed Guantanamo. He stopped the secret arrest. He stopped indition. Barack Obama's
[41:30.040 --> 41:41.200]  done this. All lies, all lies, all lies, all lies. But hey, it makes you feel good. But
[41:41.200 --> 41:45.760]  see, it was it was fun to be upset about torture and bush and wars and police state and the
[41:45.760 --> 41:51.520]  Patriot Act and warrantless spying. You got to feel like good Democrats and good moral
[41:51.520 --> 41:56.960]  people and darn it. We're going to do something. We're going to get the Democrats in in 2006
[41:56.960 --> 42:01.040]  and the war expands. And then we're going to get Obama in and all expands and but doesn't
[42:01.040 --> 42:08.000]  matter now. Now, well, we're running the war and now it's darn good. And well, we need
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.520]  to do what he says. He'll get the economy going. He's I've actually had him email me
[42:11.520 --> 42:15.520]  and go, you know, how dare you in your film claim that Barack Obama was involved in that
[42:15.520 --> 42:21.680]  dastardly banker bailout. He's fighting that. Well, wait till you see the Obama deception.
[42:21.680 --> 42:25.920]  It's nothing but him up there bragging that he's the one that got it rammed through through
[42:25.920 --> 42:31.680]  the different caucuses of the Democratic Party. I mean, you guys are complete and total Jim
[42:31.680 --> 42:38.160]  Jones Kool-Aid drinking fools. You love to be suckered. There in the scam out there that
[42:38.160 --> 42:44.400]  the mainline Republicans and Democrats hadn't bought into. Let me give you a newsflash. Barack
[42:44.400 --> 42:52.560]  Obama is a frontman puppet. Barack Obama runs nothing. He is a PR public relations creation.
[42:52.560 --> 43:00.400]  He might as well be a Max Hadrum hologram. It doesn't matter. He goes out and lies to
[43:00.400 --> 43:06.560]  you convincingly and looks right into the camera reading the teleprompter. He's just a better liar
[43:06.560 --> 43:12.800]  than George Bush. George Bush, who looked like Satan with his horns cut off. Uh, you know,
[43:13.520 --> 43:16.880]  see how that was all scripted for you. All right, I promise we're going to your calls.
[43:16.880 --> 43:23.360]  Matt John Steve, George Billy Bob. We always love calling getting calls from people like Billy Bob.

[47:48.080 --> 47:51.680]  Welcome back. We're going to go ahead and go straight to your phone calls.
[47:51.680 --> 48:04.480]  And we better start shouting at the international bankers. Shout at the
[48:04.480 --> 48:09.280]  real devil and realize that the real enemy is and has orchestrated this collapse and bring in
[48:09.280 --> 48:15.520]  world government or things are just going to get worse and worse in this society.
[48:15.520 --> 48:21.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in California. Matt, you're on the air.
[48:22.080 --> 48:27.440]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing? Good, sir. I'd like to just thank you first of all for all that
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.480]  you've done so far. I joined the info war in October and I just can't believe how much I've
[48:32.480 --> 48:39.040]  learned so far. But I just wanted to give you, I just wanted to talk about an economist that
[48:39.040 --> 48:45.280]  Ron Paul quoted in his book, The Manifesto, and it was Frederick Bastia. Have you ever heard his name?
[48:45.840 --> 48:52.080]  Yes. And he used the term plunder when he'd talk about banks and he'd talk about, he'd use the
[48:52.080 --> 48:57.600]  term plunder when he'd talk about the French socialist coming in. And that's basically one of the,
[48:58.160 --> 49:03.760]  you know... Yeah, yeah. Low-level liberals think that, oh, we're a bunch of hippies. We're going
[49:03.760 --> 49:07.200]  to make a big government and take money from the middle class. They think of the middle class
[49:07.200 --> 49:12.480]  as the elite. But in every case in history, the last 200 years, socialism is funded by the big
[49:12.480 --> 49:18.000]  financiers because they want to take control of governments and steal the tax money for themselves.
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.600]  Then they just call it a workers paradise and give a little bit of chicken feed to the blue
[49:23.600 --> 49:28.400]  collar workers when it's the bankers themselves that destroy the economy where the people then
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.960]  think they've got to go to government for their sustenance. Exactly. Is it okay if I give you
[49:32.960 --> 49:39.760]  a quote real quick and then I'll... Go ahead. Sure. In his book, there was a big essay called
[49:39.760 --> 49:45.120]  The Law. He says, this chapter is called How to Identify Legal Plunder. And it says,
[49:45.120 --> 49:50.720]  but how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply, see if the law takes from some
[49:50.720 --> 49:56.400]  persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. And he says,
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.840]  see if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself
[50:01.840 --> 50:08.720]  cannot do without committing a crime. And that sentence just hits it right there. I mean,
[50:08.720 --> 50:14.400]  we are just being plundered. And I love how he uses this term, but that's all I had to say.
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.320]  And I hope people read his books. Frederick Ostiaud really, he combines economics with
[50:21.920 --> 50:25.840]  society and how it all comes together. It's really great. So thank you very much, Alex.
[50:25.840 --> 50:32.320]  Thanks for calling. Reading books, though, most Americans don't do that. That's not cool. No,
[50:32.320 --> 50:38.960]  no, no. What's cool is to tune into mainline talk radio and have fake conservatives tell you that
[50:38.960 --> 50:46.320]  it's a commie conspiracy and that it's dumb hippies that are taking over. No. It's international banks
[50:46.320 --> 50:52.000]  that want big government so that they can have corporate welfare from it and use government
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.040]  against their competition, use federal regulators and state regulators to shut down their competition.
[50:58.400 --> 51:03.920]  And under the Republican administration, we saw a tripling in the size of government.
[51:03.920 --> 51:08.720]  And now Obama is getting ready to triple it again and claiming he's going to cut the budget deficit
[51:08.720 --> 51:16.240]  in half when every form of spending is already being close to double buying in office one month.
[51:16.240 --> 51:22.880]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Pennsylvania. John, welcome.
[51:23.920 --> 51:26.800]  Alex, how are you doing today, my friend? Good, sir.
[51:26.800 --> 51:30.720]  Hey, it's great to talk to you finally. I've been listening for about
[51:32.080 --> 51:34.960]  a little over a year now. I woke up about a year and a half ago.
[51:36.400 --> 51:40.400]  And I just want to say you are responsible for me waking up. Thank you.
[51:40.400 --> 51:44.240]  Well, God bless you, sir. You know what? If I'm going to be free, you've got to be free. And the
[51:44.240 --> 51:48.240]  more people we wake up, the better. So I didn't do you a favor there, brother. I just did my duty.
[51:48.800 --> 51:55.600]  Well, and I've taken it, I've taken it one step further. I've been doing all the research all
[51:55.600 --> 52:03.920]  this time and wondering what I can do to help. And what I've decided to do is open a new chapter
[52:04.480 --> 52:11.120]  of We Are Change. And I'm here to announce that the Northwestern Pennsylvania
[52:11.120 --> 52:16.080]  chapter of We Are Change is officially launched. Good. And for those that don't know what that is,
[52:16.080 --> 52:20.400]  I guess about two years ago, Luke Radowski, when he was 20 years old, a 9-11 truth activist,
[52:20.400 --> 52:25.440]  an anti-globalist activist, sort of We Are Change. And we tried to build a platform for him. He did
[52:25.440 --> 52:28.800]  a lot of great work in front of a lot of people, still does it. And I think there's something
[52:28.800 --> 52:34.000]  like a hundred plus chapters from as far away as Japan and Australia to the Netherlands. Good
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.160]  to hear from you, my friend. That's exciting. Get a website up and you can call in and plug it.
[52:38.160 --> 52:44.480]  Steve in Texas. You're on the air. Yeah, Alex. A few things I want to comment on real quick.
[52:44.480 --> 52:50.000]  Now I have a couple of questions. First of all, this kernel with the Iowa National Guide that
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.000]  you interviewed on Friday. I have one thing to say in response to all that stuff he gave you,
[52:56.000 --> 53:02.320]  Bull. I mean, I can't believe what this guy was saying. 23 years with the National Guard didn't
[53:02.320 --> 53:08.080]  know what was going on that you cited to him was in the local newscast. I think that guy
[53:08.080 --> 53:12.960]  is just a puppet. But notice they're spokesman. He admitted they were going to do door-to-door gun
[53:12.960 --> 53:17.600]  checks. They were going to practice locking down towns. He admitted he knew that the National Guard
[53:17.600 --> 53:22.400]  was being federalized and there is a plan to use 20,000 combat troops on the streets of America.
[53:22.400 --> 53:26.640]  And he then had to admit he said, we'll never confiscate guns. I said, oh, well, was the Iowa
[53:26.640 --> 53:31.040]  Guard involved in New Orleans? And he kind of went, and then he said, I can't comment. Yes,
[53:31.040 --> 53:36.480]  we were there. And then I said, and then I brought up PDD 51 and he said, I can't comment on that.
[53:36.480 --> 53:41.440]  He goes, yeah, I know what that is. You see, I mean, this is sick. Yeah, I made me want to throw
[53:41.440 --> 53:47.600]  up when he actually had the nerve to talk about them defending the Constitution. I also want to
[53:47.600 --> 53:53.520]  mention this. I heard the other day in the news, Obama commenting after his sinfulness package,
[53:53.520 --> 53:58.240]  and that's what I call it, got passed. He made this statement and you probably heard this.
[53:58.240 --> 54:04.080]  This is the beginning of the end. And I think that's really fitting. And of course, people
[54:04.080 --> 54:08.240]  are probably thinking that I'm bored with him. Well, you know, this is about the, you know,
[54:08.240 --> 54:13.200]  bringing our economy out of the crisis it's in. But of course, we know what he really means by
[54:13.200 --> 54:18.000]  that. And I thought it was fitting that the newscasters commented that said, this will give
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.160]  the economy its biggest shot in the arm ever. And I think that's funny and double speak because
[54:24.160 --> 54:30.720]  what you know about vaccines, I think that's very fitting. Yeah, it will be the biggest shot
[54:30.720 --> 54:35.040]  in the arm. It'll be the death of our economy. Absolutely. I appreciate your call. Folks,
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.000]  whether you love the 30 million illegal aliens or hate them, I don't blame people in a horrible
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.880]  third world nation of corruption who are being driven off their ancestral land and being enslaved,
[54:46.880 --> 54:53.680]  wanting to come up here. But in the final equation, if you look at the numbers just in
[54:53.680 --> 55:00.000]  carcerating, illegal aliens in Texas cost millions of dollars a year. In carcerating them in California
[55:00.000 --> 55:06.000]  cost tens of millions paying for them to have the babies up here. Then they become citizens and get
[55:06.000 --> 55:12.400]  on welfare. And they've done federal studies on this outnumbers all the amount of taxes or all
[55:12.400 --> 55:17.440]  the work or all they add to the economy. And I don't care if the people from South the border
[55:17.440 --> 55:22.480]  were white, black, purple, green or polka dotted. I am against what's happening that on top of it,
[55:22.480 --> 55:27.200]  Mexico lost two wars with the U.S. And they teach in their schools that the Southwest belongs to
[55:27.200 --> 55:32.640]  Mexico. And this is now even being taught in our public schools. So the globalist want to break
[55:32.640 --> 55:38.560]  this country apart and Mexico is in civil war, is collapsing. I've been telling you that for four
[55:38.560 --> 55:44.720]  years. Now it's in the Washington Post and the New York Times and CNN today. And there have been
[55:44.720 --> 55:49.520]  more than 10,000. I finally got the last numbers. You know, late in the year, I was seeing 8,000
[55:49.520 --> 55:54.880]  plus murders on the border with the U.S. and Mexico. That's just on the border. It was more than
[55:54.880 --> 55:59.760]  that. They have thousands a week down there total. I mean, it's just total bedlam. But now the
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.960]  latest numbers came out from last year. That was coming out a few months late. Over 10,000 murders
[56:04.960 --> 56:13.840]  on the Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California border. And it's spilling over. They are killing
[56:13.840 --> 56:19.360]  police. They're killing military. They've killed FBI. And it's always barely a mission in the news.
[56:19.360 --> 56:24.880]  I mean, if a citizen kills an FBI agent, it's like the world ended and they have big parades
[56:24.880 --> 56:28.800]  and the cops cry and there's all this freaking out. And you know, it is not a good thing. I'm
[56:28.800 --> 56:32.960]  I'm not, but the point is, well, here's an example. 90% of the time of a cop's killed,
[56:32.960 --> 56:36.240]  they find the person that did it only 10% of the time. If a citizen is killed, they find
[56:36.240 --> 56:41.120]  it. I think a citizen is worth as much as a cop or a fireman or anybody else. And you sign on
[56:41.120 --> 56:46.160]  to this heroic dangerous job. But the point is that when the Mexican troops and that's who's
[56:46.160 --> 56:51.760]  dealing the drugs, it's the Mexican government. Kill police and military and citizens and burn
[56:51.760 --> 56:56.720]  out houses and attack ranchers. The federal government instead comes in and sues the ranchers
[56:56.720 --> 57:02.720]  if they dare arrest people trespassing. And that's like England where forget going to prison,
[57:02.720 --> 57:06.560]  if you shoot somebody that invades your house, hiding a gun that, you know, that's been banned
[57:06.560 --> 57:11.840]  for 20 years, they put you in jail in cases. If you break a vase, like a man broke a vase over
[57:11.840 --> 57:17.760]  a guy's head, it was raping his wife in his house. They let the criminal out and prosecuted him,
[57:17.760 --> 57:21.760]  the guy that protected his wife. Same thing here in the US. Every week I see articles where
[57:21.760 --> 57:26.640]  a crook falls through a skylight in somebody's house or slips and falls in a house or cuts
[57:26.640 --> 57:32.640]  themselves breaking in and the cops come and the lawsuits are filed and the homeowner gets in
[57:32.640 --> 57:39.680]  trouble for the crook invading. Folks, this is what's happening. This is what's happening in
[57:39.680 --> 57:43.280]  the United States. And if you don't believe me, the stories I just told, and then you're hiding
[57:43.280 --> 57:48.720]  under a rock, that's been all over the news. The system is meant to go after good, hardworking
[57:48.720 --> 57:54.000]  Americans. Like the famous case of the guy had rats eating his tomatoes. So he killed one with a
[57:54.000 --> 58:01.440]  shovel and a neighbor saw it and called the animal people and then he went to jail. And folks,
[58:02.000 --> 58:09.200]  again, this is all about getting regular citizens in the net. This is all about capturing
[58:09.200 --> 58:14.400]  regular citizens because we're the ones that have money they can suck off of. Here's an example.
[58:14.400 --> 58:21.600]  99% and I just saw these numbers today in the mainstream news. 99%. I'll cover it when I get
[58:21.600 --> 58:26.640]  back. I'm out of time. Hi, this is Ted Henderson. Did you miss your favorite shows on GCN today?

[58:53.760 --> 58:58.240]  Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[58:58.240 --> 59:03.360]  IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of

[1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:43.520]  Hi, R&U SA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan. Some Republican governors are turning down part of
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:49.520]  the federal stimulus money, while at least one other GOP governor wants more. Here's Tim McGuire.
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:54.400]  Louisiana's Bobby Jindal tells NBC's Meet the Press that taking short-term federal money to
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:59.280]  expand the unemployment system would cripple employers in his state. This will result an
[1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:02.560]  increase in taxes on our businesses. California's Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:06.880]  just off a bruising budget battle with the legislature, tells ABC's this week,
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:11.200]  if Jindal and the others don't want the money, I take it. The federal stimulus plan is one of the
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:15.840]  topics in the National Governor's Association meeting being held in the nation's capital.
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:21.360]  Tim McGuire, Washington. And President Obama is expected to focus on physical issues this week
[1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:26.960]  as he prepares to submit his first budget request to Congress. A White House official says the goal
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:33.040]  is to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:40.000]  My name is John DeMartino. I'm from Colorado and I started using Andy Willoughby's three-step plan.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:46.400]  It's extremely encouraging for me and they've given me training on exactly what to say and I
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:51.760]  don't have to be a salesman to talk to people that are calling me. It's made me feel like,
[1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:58.080]  wow, let's do business. I can only conceive of growing and growing and growing now.
[1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:05.600]  I'm 56 years old and I feel young. I feel renewed. I'm happy. I'm excited about my financial future
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:12.000]  in a short amount of time. Less than an hour a day if someone wanted to. They could have a system.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:17.280]  This is a stress-relieving business. Hi, how in the world are you anyway? This is Andy Willoughby.
[1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:22.960]  After five years, the three-step plan is a proven success story. If you're tired of worrying about

[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:40.160]  Rescuers say all the trapped miners have been found after a gas explosion ripped through a coal mine
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:48.160]  in northern China. At least 74 were killed and 114 hospitalized. China's news agency says more than
[1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:53.920]  400 workers were in the mine when the blast occurred. People have been gathering at ceremonies
[1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:58.800]  across Australia today to remember the more than 200 people killed in this month's wildfires.
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:05.200]  In a Melbourne stadium, thousands ranked tiny bells and dignitaries, including Queen Elizabeth's
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:10.960]  daughter, Princess Anne, placed white flowers on a large wreath. Last year's Academy Awards
[1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:15.920]  brought their worst TV ratings ever, so this year's producers are hoping to liven things up.
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:22.240]  Viewers of tonight's live show on ABC may see some new ways of presenting awards and other surprises.
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:28.640]  The rags to riches tell Slumdog Millionaire is favored to win. For more news and analysis,

[1:03:58.720 --> 1:04:10.640]  There are new attempts to curb the influence of the Taliban in a remote area of Pakistan.
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:28.800]  Here's Steve Graham. European leaders meeting in Berlin are backing sweeping new regulations
[1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:34.240]  for financial markets and hedge funds. A statement from German Chancellor Angela Merkel says the
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:39.040]  leaders agreed on seven key points during their one-day meeting. This is British Prime Minister
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:05:00.320]  Gordon Brown. He said he'd be back and he soon will be. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:05.280]  says he'll be shooting a cameo appearance soon for a new movie by friend Sylvester Stallone.
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:10.080]  Schwarzenegger calls Stallone a terrific director and writer and a great actor.
[1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:26.240]  And one of Schwarzenegger's favorite political movies? The candidate with Robert Redford.
[1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:33.200]  The governor appeared on ABC's This Week. I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:36.880]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products,
[1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:40.880]  vitamins, or herbal supplements? Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions,
[1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:45.120]  shampoos, and toothpaste are full of chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate,
[1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:49.360]  the same type of detergent used in dish soap? Did you know that most multi-vitamin

[1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:21.040]  I've seen several press reports in the last few days with the numbers on red light cameras
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:24.640]  that are going up all over the nation. The people don't like them. They're completely
[1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:28.480]  unpopular in every poll. Government doesn't care. They put them in because the government
[1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:32.880]  doesn't represent us. They represent the governments that are controlled and owned by foreign banks.
[1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:37.520]  Your cities and counties are all bought off and paid off literally through the comprehensive
[1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:40.800]  annual financial reports, and they're here to suck money out of you and send it offshore.
[1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:45.360]  But I saw the numbers, and I'd already seen these previously, but to see them all together,
[1:07:45.360 --> 1:08:01.920]  were 99% of the tickets being given, 99% of them were a ride on red or slow stopping,
[1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:07.040]  where somebody had to edge up to the intersection past the white line
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:13.200]  to see when they could go out. And going back about a decade ago,
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:17.440]  they would just have the red light cameras for red lights, but people stopped running red lights.
[1:08:21.840 --> 1:08:29.200]  Or they would stop where it's yellow, but you go ahead and zoom through.
[1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:37.280]  So what they did is they started turning right on red or pulling past the white line,
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:41.200]  and they were admitting in this press report that most of the tickets were for that.
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:46.560]  You know, something you see police do all day, something that you have to do to be safe coming
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:52.000]  up to the intersection. It's about money. It's about control. Meanwhile, the border is collapsing,
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:59.360]  rocket attacks, bombings of newspapers, mass killings, society breaking down, police being killed.
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:04.720]  I've interviewed so many sheriffs who've had Mexican troops when they bust a car full of cocaine,
[1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:08.240]  three miles off the border. They'll pull up guns in their heads, take it away,
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:13.200]  the feds tell them, I'll just don't talk about what happened to you. And what's happening in
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:23.120]  Mexico right now is the, I'll never forget, 1999. Reuters showed Richard Grasso, the head of the
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:30.000]  New York Stock Exchange at the time, not one of the other heads, Bernard Madoff. That's another one
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  of the guys, but it's a nice group of people. Oh yeah, Madoff was one of the top guys. He actually
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:41.440]  founded the Nasdaq. Grasso went down there and there's actually a federal law where foreign
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:47.440]  countries or groups can actually invest narcotics money in the stock market or U.S. banks. And so
[1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:51.680]  it was a Reuters article with him hugging the head of the FARC, Guerrillas, the communist to control
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:56.320]  half of Columbia and some surrounding nations and said, invest your drug money with us or we're
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:00.720]  going to have an invasion. And the FARC said no. And so U.S. forces have been down there for more
[1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:07.760]  than a decade. That was in 99. So I guess right at 10 years. So they last year finally killed the
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:13.120]  head of the FARC, but you know, somebody replaced him. And I remember interviewing Celica Stella,
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:17.840]  former head of the DEA on all of Latin America and all the press reports I've got. And I've been
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:22.080]  down in Mexico many times in high school and college and after that or even as a kid with my
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:27.120]  parents and seeing, you know, troops guarding marijuana fields. I mean, the government controls
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:35.120]  narcotics and the only war is against the four or five cartels that are a minority of the total
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:41.600]  business, but they're keeping prices down and the big U.S. banks and the stock exchange and the
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:45.760]  Mexican government don't like that. So the U.S. is spending tens of billions a year, quote,
[1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:51.840]  in a drug war and the other cartels are fighting back. And so that's what you see happening down
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:58.800]  there. It is a war. A Pentagon prosecuted the Pentagon advisors down there for the narcotics
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:04.000]  and don't roll your eyes and say it's not true. Remember last year when a jet flying into Mexico,
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:09.200]  CIA tail numbers, one that had been used in renditions to Abu Ghraib and other places
[1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:15.920]  and to Camp Xray and Guantanamo Bay. This was in Reuters AP, never made national news here,
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:20.560]  though, it was just from the newswires, crashed with pure cocaine. Why is pure cocaine important?
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:26.720]  Three and a half tons of it because it meant it came directly from the source. You understand?
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:33.360]  You see, the drug war is destroying our country. It destroyed China 150 years ago. It's destroying
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:38.720]  Mexico because by making drugs illegal, that jacks up the price and the criminal element comes in
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:44.560]  and takes over and then gets incredible funding for other criminal operations.
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:52.480]  Cocaine, heroin, opium, speed was all sold at drug stores in every town and city until the 30s.
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:58.720]  And if you look at the statistics, less than a third of the people per capita were on those drugs
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:06.800]  that are on today. When cocaine was in Coca-Cola, you had a lot less cocaine heads. When it was in
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:11.600]  Dr. Pepper, you had less. When you could buy heroin, you could send your 10-year-old down the
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:17.280]  street to buy you heroin if you wanted to. And people had problems with it, but it was seen as
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:24.640]  a pathetic disease and people got treatment. So your drug war is a fraud. Period. The bigger it
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:28.640]  gets, the more drugs we have on the street, the bigger a police state we have. But I mean, here's
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:33.840]  the proof. As crime mounts, Mexicans turn to vigilante justice and Time Magazine talks about,
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:38.800]  is it okay that Mexicans illegally are buying guns and shooting criminals when they rob them?
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:43.920]  Because it's not just drug crime. It's all forms of crime. The society is falling apart. And our
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:49.680]  media is so controlled, they say, is it okay for people when they're getting robbed to defend
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:57.200]  themselves? I don't know. I don't understand. Graphic photos of the alleged thief's corpse were
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:02.880]  splashed on the front pages of Mexican dabloids beneath headlines that read, such as,
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:10.560]  Dead Brat and Military Justice. The confessed shooter, retired general, Al Gerardo Florez,
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:14.880]  was widely hailed as a hero for firing at a 30-year-old man who had tried to force his way in the
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:20.080]  military man's Mexico City home. Of course, he did the right thing, wrote Felipe Alacorte, Al
[1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:27.920]  Coker, is in one line from the incident. I wish everyone would act in the same way and get rid of
[1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:32.560]  the anti-social scum. Yeah, they don't have a second amendment down there. So of course,
[1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:36.880]  their crime's horrible, just like Chicago and D.C. have gun bans and highest crime rates in the
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:41.520]  world. That's how it works. But Obama's got more than 10 bills to basically ban the second
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:45.920]  amendment introduced right now. George in Texas, thanks for holding. Then Billy Ball.
[1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:50.640]  How you doing, Alex? Good. You know, the thing is, I got an argument with a Chicago police officer
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:55.680]  down here on vacation. And he's told me guns are bad and all that stuff. But he's got one.
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:14:00.160]  Yeah. Well, the thing is, I just thought, if I were in Chicago and not give up my guns,
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:04.720]  I'd say, seeing that off-duty police officer beat up that small little bartender, I would
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:09.600]  put a bullet in his head. Well, that's because you're with Al Qaeda. It's good that the police
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:15.120]  are shaking people down in Chicago in Mafia Run. It's good, and it's pro-America, that they beat
[1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:19.920]  up women and public and children and rule. Okay, that's what America's about. And you,
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:26.240]  sir, are with Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda. No. No. If an off-duty cop wants to beat
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:31.680]  you up, you tell him, thank you, and take your own head and smash it into a brick. In fact,
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:36.320]  you say, yes, God, and run and jump off a cliff, and then scream, you are God, you are God,
[1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:41.040]  you are God, I worship you, to the police officer as he smiles, looking at you over the cliff as
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:46.480]  you fall. Police are only good. They were good. They were good. They were good. They were good.
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:52.800]  The police are only good. They were good at Nazi Germany. They were good under Stalin. They were
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:58.080]  good under Mao. The police are all good in Mexico. There's no police corruption. There's no drug
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:04.720]  dealing. The police do nothing wrong. It's good to have face-scanning cameras everywhere and black
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:10.000]  masks on the police and armored vehicles. It's good to have the IRS SWAT team stealing homes with
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.680]  no judges or juries. It's good that foreign banks rule the country and that most of the
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:20.080]  Congress doesn't even pay taxes, and most of Obama's officials don't even pay them and then run the
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:31.040]  Treasury Department. That is good. That is good. How dare you call into this show? How dare the
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:35.200]  founding fathers when the police and the system got out of control? That's how tyranny always comes
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:42.480]  as in a uniform. How dare them fight back against King George III? How dare them resist? How dare
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:48.480]  them? I stand with the average person in government. I stand against the evil founding fathers,
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:55.200]  and to be serious, in my film, Road to Tyranny, I have FEMA teaching Kansas City police that we
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:59.600]  have training manuals from around the nation, not just there saying the founding fathers are bad,
[1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:08.640]  gun owners are bad. I have the training manuals, all of it. But you know what? So what if in New
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:12.720]  York and Chicago and other places the police are beating and killing whoever they want? That's
[1:16:12.720 --> 1:16:19.440]  good, sir. They have a tough job, and you are evil. I can't believe how evil that last caller was.
[1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:24.880]  How dare him? He's with Al Qaeda. Billy Bob, TJ, Michael, Steve, Patriot Bear, Ryan, and many
[1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:30.560]  others. Phone blitz coming up and then a ton of other important news. Remember, tyranny is your
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:35.680]  friend. Government is only right. Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way
[1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:40.560]  too much about your financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:45.520]  bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:50.720]  again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:56.240]  and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:17:01.680]  in Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:06.240]  government intervention. For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the

[1:20:40.400 --> 1:21:02.240]  Well the answer to the government is just to arm the people. That'll fix all the crime. Of course,
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:08.080]  it explodes. That's what they like. They have an excuse to put more cops on the streets to write
[1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:12.880]  more tickets. But no matter how many police there are, you just can't seem to get one when your car
[1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:26.320]  gets stolen. And the establishment doesn't like that. They want you dependent, institutionalized,
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:34.080]  in debt under their control. All right, but listen, a lot of police are great. It's the system that
[1:21:34.080 --> 1:21:40.800]  is bad now. And obviously, 99% of the time, police are agents of oppression worldwide. Throughout
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:46.880]  history in the days of Rome, in the days of the Aztecs, in modern times in Nazi Germany,
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:53.120]  the police are under the control of evil government. They become evil. And if you can't tell our
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:58.240]  government's evil, and if you can't tell it's illegitimate, not a control, you are living in
[1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:04.800]  another plane of existence. Government's too big. It's a cancer. And instead of getting smaller,
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:10.080]  it's going to expand again. And most of you out there are going to lose most of what you got.
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:15.840]  Just remember that. But I know you love bootlicking, so you'll enjoy it. Not my listeners, but new
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:20.960]  listeners I know who enjoy the system, enjoy being raped. Well, okay, don't let me stand in the way
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:26.080]  or happiness is a success. You just don't know history, though, do you? Billy Bob calling from
[1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:30.320]  the planet. So I guess he's here on the planet earth, not if they're in the International
[1:22:30.320 --> 1:22:37.600]  Space Station. Hello, Billy Bob. From planet Gonzalez, Alex. Okay, they just said planet on
[1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:42.400]  here. I believe I owe you a cup of coffee at least lunch. How you doing? Hey, good, buddy. What's
[1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:52.160]  going on? Man, you know I'm always listening. Great to talk to you. You're so out there,
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:58.320]  you're precisely gone. Absolutely. Sorry about that. Sounds like you're gone.
[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:07.760]  You're precisely absolutely gone viral and I'm out in the boonies and wherever I go,
[1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:15.520]  you know, I just don't run into people that corner me or push me around for
[1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:25.440]  any efforts of mine to be a patriot and to reiterate you, your name, and so you're saying
[1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:32.640]  folks are very receptive to the truth of what's happening. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I never, I haven't,
[1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:37.840]  I don't get anybody that bows up to me at all. Of course, I'm not real aggressive with it,
[1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:47.120]  you know, don't have to be. And I just let them, well, I kind of got an edge. I'm an aircraft
[1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:52.560]  mechanic and I'll just tell them, hey listen, you'll never see a kerosene heater melt down
[1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:57.520]  and run out the door. And that was absolutely, those planes did not bring down the trade towers
[1:23:57.520 --> 1:24:03.520]  and then there was building seven, which is another whole topic. I mean, when you cook
[1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:08.000]  stuff on your stove, the metal grate doesn't melt and that fire is hotter than jet fuel.
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:13.920]  Look at that, that Chinese building, brand new building, burned with 200 foot flames for several
[1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:19.280]  days, nothing collapsed, nothing fell in and no plane hit building seven on 9-11.
[1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:26.560]  No, no, no, not at all. And people though are just very, they're looking for help,
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:31.440]  they're looking for answers and they're not looking at mainstream television.
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:39.280]  And they're watching that less and less and they're really searching for a way out and
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:45.840]  there's only one way out and that's the truth. Absolutely. And, you know, I'm talking to a
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:50.880]  lot of station owners and program directors and I even have talked to some very big radio consultants
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:55.840]  who contacted me, famous people in the radio industry and they said, Alex, your time has come.
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:59.440]  The people want you, you would be the number one show in the country,
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:03.520]  but obviously the big corporations that own the biggest stations aren't going to let you on the
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:09.200]  air. But they tell me that and I've had meetings before at the highest levels of radio, you know,
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:14.000]  even the high level executives are scared and know that they're not members of the elite,
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:19.280]  know that their time is numbered, know this, know that America is dying, but that's what they're
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:26.000]  saying. Massive calls to talk radio, especially local talk radio, you know, that is anti-New
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:32.880]  World Order, anti-globalist, pro-America and that basically my view, your view, the reality view
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:38.720]  is taking over and exploding. And I mean, I'm just one small part of this, but my web numbers,
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:45.120]  our radio listener numbers, everything is just hyperbolic right now. It is exploding. Good to
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:51.440]  hear from you, my friend. Let's talk to TJ in Minnesota. You're on the air, TJ.
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:26:00.320]  Parabellum. Parabellum, Alex Jones. You recognize this voice I'd imagine and I haven't talked to
[1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:06.160]  you for about five years at your request, but the time is short, brother. Parabellum. Everybody
[1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:12.160]  needs to look up that word. It means if you want peace, prepare for war because the time is short,
[1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:21.280]  but I got a compliment for you. You stood down an Iowa light kernel Friday in very good civilian
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:26.240]  fashion. And then I have a question for you and then I got to get off this landline.
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:32.720]  James Janos. His other name is Jesse Ventura. We need him back in Minnesota.
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:39.840]  Godspeed Parabellum. You want peace, prepare for war. I'll stand by for a little bit.
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:43.760]  All right, buddy. Good to hear from you. I do recognize your voice vaguely, but I don't remember
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:51.520]  telling you not to call the show anymore. I do sometimes tell regular callers to give other
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:56.720]  folks a chance to call in. Like I see a caller calling five days in a row. We don't screen calls,
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:27:01.840]  but if I hear the same guy, I go, hey, don't call in for a week or two. Because a lot of folks try
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:06.400]  to get in. People try for years to get in sometimes and they can't get in. The lines have been filled
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:14.000]  the whole show, but there is a open line right now at 877-590-5525. But yeah, for those that
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:19.840]  don't know, I might as well go ahead and cover this article now because it was our big top news
[1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:27.920]  story on Friday's weekday show. If you go read the Daily Times Herald article, Guardsman to
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:34.880]  conduct urban training at Arcadia in April, April 2nd through the 5th, it says they're going to go
[1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:38.640]  door to door into simulated gun confiscations. I mean, go read the article. You can't make this
[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:43.680]  stuff up. They say because of the political climate in the U.S. today, this is needed.
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:49.120]  This is the same stuff I videotaped over a decade ago where the Marines in the Army trained to
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:54.080]  confiscate our guns. Then when they went into New Orleans, they didn't go into the areas where
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:58.480]  folks were flooded. They went into high and dry areas on ABC News and NBC. We have the footage
[1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:05.840]  confiscated people's guns to the point of where Louisiana just passed a law saying that if the
[1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:11.200]  feds tried again, the state police are to repulse them. I mean, we're getting to the point where
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:15.440]  Montana passed it through their house. They're on the verge of passing a law saying they're not
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:22.080]  going to follow federal gun laws. Texas just introduced, I have the state rep Leo Birdman
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:28.320]  on Friday. He's introduced a bill to basically have the state not follow federal orders. I mean,
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:31.280]  the state's created the federal government under the 10th Amendment.
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:38.240]  But yeah, they were going to have this urban warfare takeover drill. And then
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:46.320]  we got calls from a mayor and others telling us Friday, oh, the drills are canceled now. Please
[1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:52.080]  tell folks not to call anymore. And I told my crew Friday night, I said, you watch by next Monday,
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:29:00.080]  they're going to announce, oh, no, now it's only being scaled back. But this is to acclimate the
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:06.080]  troops, acclimate the police, acclimate the public and the media that having troops running around
[1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:11.440]  with machine guns, firing blanks and throwing flashbangs and practicing that said they're going
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:18.080]  to citizens door to door looking for evil gun dealers and they practice writing a gun shop
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:26.080]  and they practice finding the the forms and then going and writing the houses to confiscate the
[1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:41.440]  guns. We'll be right back. Stay with us. News flash unemployment is soaring over 10%. The dollar is
[1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:48.000]  plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors. Financial experts are saying we are

[1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:06.720]  Are taxes, food, energy, housing, medical, forcing Americans into poverty? Is free enterprise
[1:33:06.720 --> 1:33:10.960]  flawed or is our monetary system forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and
[1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:15.120]  higher taxes? The answers are in Griffin's book The Creature from Jekyll Island. Ron Paul states
[1:33:15.120 --> 1:33:18.800]  it's what every American needs to know about the Fed and central banking. Hi, Ted Anderson,

[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:42.000]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio? Well, search no more. We are the GCN Radio Network.
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:45.840]  We are back live.
[1:33:45.840 --> 1:33:53.440]  You know, I ought to do a show sometime the next week or on next Sunday's show
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:34:01.120]  where I come in with like 200 mainstream news articles calling for a new world order. But then
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:07.280]  the detractors say, well, a new order doesn't mean what you say it means. Oh, really? All these
[1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:13.200]  articles where the mainstream media is announcing it say that it's a new quote bank of the world
[1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:19.120]  to control the United States and the planet that we'll pay taxes to. Unelected global bank rulings.
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:24.320]  And then challenge, dig up all the articles where I've been attacked saying the new order doesn't
[1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:30.400]  exist and challenge those people to, you know, go on record to say it doesn't exist now.
[1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:36.000]  But that's a military tactic, you know, when the regular army and the Delta Force
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:39.440]  were ramming the Branch Davidian Church and machine gunning them as they tried to run out
[1:34:39.440 --> 1:34:45.040]  the back all on flare footage, congressional testimony. And we have Janet Reno's order
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:47.760]  ordering a man. I mean, the truth is there. You just don't see it on the news.
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:52.320]  Love or hate those people. They deserve to be killed like that, especially all those children.
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:57.280]  But they kept broadcasting. This is not an assault. This is not an assault. Come out with
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:02.720]  your hands up and they'd run out with their hands up and they shoot them. It's the same thing here.
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:07.120]  This is not a world government. There's no foreign banks doing anything. Everything's fine.
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:11.920]  The collapse is an accident. Just do as we say. Let us take over. Everything's fine.
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:14.800]  Yes, we're going to have carbon taxes. Yes, there's a new world order, but the new
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:19.760]  order doesn't exist. I mean, so instead we always have a debate about is there a new world order
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:24.400]  when they're all over the place announcing it instead of saying we don't want a new world order.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:31.520]  And that's done in combat over and over and over and over again. And in PsyOps, they will tell you.
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:38.640]  And if you can read Army manuals on this and other governments have put this on record as well,
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:42.000]  that when they're attacking foxholes or attacking positions, they'll broadcast.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:46.480]  We're not assaulting. We're here to help you. Everything's fine. Just so people get confused
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:51.200]  and hesitate. Now, if you like military propaganda being run on you,
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:55.840]  first it was 5 billion, then 10 billion. Another thing, 44 billion a year
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:01.680]  is to be spent to, quote, clean up the image of the Pentagon, domestic propaganda,
[1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:07.760]  brainwashing everybody. I mean, you know what kind of propaganda 45 billion will buy?
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:14.160]  I mean, North comms taking over the country. This isn't our military. This isn't our government.
[1:36:14.160 --> 1:36:18.800]  Can't you understand just like third world nations get hijacked by banks? We've been hijacked.
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:22.880]  And I know I talked to a lot of the troops. They're upset. They know what's going on.
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:28.000]  And we appreciate them out there defending the Bill of Rights and Constitution. We appreciate
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:32.400]  good police doing that as well. And if we all start saying no together, this new world order
[1:36:32.400 --> 1:36:35.520]  will fail. But if we don't, it's going to get bad because they're holding us hostage. They're going
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:39.760]  to continue to implode the economy and say, now do what we say, do what we say, and we'll fix it.
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:43.200]  And then if we don't do what they say, they'll keep butchering the economy and say, see, it's your
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:48.320]  fault. But if you do follow their orders, they just continue to crush things as well.
[1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:52.560]  And just check the facts. Did things get better after the first banker bailout bill or the stimulus
[1:36:52.560 --> 1:37:02.160]  now? Steve in Ottawa, Canada, you're on the air. Hi, how are you? Good, sir. Okay.
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:08.240]  You got a really bad phone, sir. Are you on a cordless or a speakerphone?
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:13.360]  I'm on a Skype. Okay, we'll just make it quick. Back off the microphone.
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:19.760]  Okay. Just wondering if you had heard about the Predator B aircraft going to be patrolling
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:24.560]  the North Dakota border near Manitoba. Yes, they're going to have predators patrol the United
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:29.840]  States, not just the borders. They have high altitude blimps at 100,000 feet in Canada, the
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:37.600]  U.S. and England with biometric body scanning software tracking everyone in real time. They
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:42.800]  know your biometric resonance just by the way your body moves from a shoot down position,
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:49.920]  from above you. Yeah, because the thing I was concerned about is these things can see about
[1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:54.960]  14 miles into the Canadian border and there's a lot of, well, Emerson, Manitoba is right on the
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:38:00.880]  border, so they can... No, I hear you. I got to let you go. Your phone's too bad. Sir, your Toronto
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:07.120]  Star and other publications reported a year ago in early 2008 that they signed a deal to use Canadian
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:13.040]  and Mexican troops in the U.S., Mexican and U.S. troops in Canada and vice versa and our Congress
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:20.320]  said, hey, we weren't consulted and your parliament said we weren't consulted and then Bush just said,
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:26.880]  shut up. Presidential Decision Directive 51 and Congress said, this was in the mainstream news,
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:33.200]  they said, well, we'd like to see this, all we've got is the cover sheet of this military agreement
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:40.240]  to use foreign troops in the U.S. Can we see the agreement? And they said no. Presidential
[1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:44.800]  Decision Directive 51, which makes the president a dictator and you notice Barack Obama hadn't
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:52.800]  rescinded that puppy. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Okay, so forget just a foreign drone over
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:58.560]  you, Bubba. They got the Texas State Police up there training Canadian Mounties how to knock heads
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:07.040]  and out around illegal checkpoints. Patriot Bear in California. Welcome, Patriot Bear. Hello. I am the Care Bear.
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:03.120]  Hey, how you doing, Alec? I'm mad. I got bad allergies. But other than that, I feel like somebody's
[1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:08.880]  well, because they think the government loves them and they're part of the power structure and
[1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:10.160]  Patty cake, you know, I mean,
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:10.960]  I
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:34.240]  they're just lambs to the slaughter. But you know, that was one call out of dozens they took
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:39.760]  that disagreed with me. I mean, I had some guy call my show this week and say, you don't talk
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:43.920]  about the elites plan to reduce world population. So I just went along with it and said, yes,
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:49.280]  you're right. I'm covering that up. I never talk about that. You know, people get frustrated
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:54.080]  by the information I put out. And instead of taking action to wake others up and say no to the tyranny,
[1:40:54.080 --> 1:41:01.360]  they get mad at the messenger. Alex, just one more thing. I'm looking at just 18 hours before
[1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:08.480]  the bill came out to look at it. Didn't he only gave 18 hours to look at it?
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:14.240]  They signed the bill. Yeah, yeah, that was media spin. Obama said we have to rush this through.
[1:41:14.240 --> 1:41:18.640]  Nobody can read it. They released it at midnight the night before from the lobbyists. This was in
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:24.000]  the Associated Press to the committees. And then they voted the next day. But they didn't post it
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:30.560]  on the web till a few hours before. So it was 1076 pages long. So nobody had a chance to read it
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:35.440]  except for the lobbyists that wrote it. And Obama had sworn to never sign something. But you know,
[1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:40.400]  until it had five days to be read, everything he says is a lie. Right. Cause I try to tell
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:46.320]  this lady at church today and she just tore me up and I just stood by ground. I said, no,
[1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:50.720]  I said, that's the problem I have with him. He doesn't give you enough time to look at it.
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:54.960]  Just rush it through. We don't know what the hell is in there. Excuse my language.
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:59.040]  And you could have half the stuff in there that is going to destroy the country even more.
[1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:02.320]  And then she said, he's trying to save us. He can't help it.
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:06.640]  No, what she told me is, well, we just need to pray. Yeah, I'm praying for my president.
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:11.680]  But it said, we've got to stand up. We the people and we need to call these guys and tell them,
[1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:15.680]  you know, make sure. No, you don't call Congress. That's al-Qaeda.
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:20.080]  Macaulay government's evil. That's what al-Qaeda does. No, no, no, I mean, to be serious.
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:24.480]  Yeah, it's not just that they, because I talked to Obama noise this week and they said, well,
[1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:29.680]  he has to do it to save us. And I said, listen, don't you understand he's continuing all the
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:34.400]  Bush policies? See, they don't care because he's their man. They didn't really care about all
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:38.320]  the torture and the secret arrest and the lies and the wars. Now that they feel like it's their
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:41.920]  president, they don't care. Now conservatives are mad about everything because they feel like
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:49.920]  their guy is an M when the globalist own both people. But the issue is he said he pledged
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:55.440]  to wait five days so a bill could be read. But then he tried to rush through when he was a senator,
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:00.720]  the banker takeover bill. The point is he lies about everything except raising taxes. He's
[1:43:00.720 --> 1:43:07.600]  going to keep that promise except he's lying saying it's the rich couples making 250 grand a year
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:13.760]  before taxes. That ain't rich, but the average person thinks it is. In fact, they've done studies.
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:17.120]  It's the people making quarter million a year are the ones that actually spend the money,
[1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:21.680]  keep the economy going. But you'll find out, don't worry, they're going to rob the middle class and
[1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:24.880]  then there won't be anybody to come to your restaurant or come to your business or give you
[1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:31.440]  tips and you'll lose everything. But that's what you like. You like being a schmuck. You like
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:37.520]  being taken for a ride. You haven't seen a sucker you don't want to suck on. And I'm talking to
[1:43:37.520 --> 1:43:41.760]  those out there that think George Bush is a conservative and I like him. And people that
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:46.400]  like Barack Obama, they're puppets of the New World Order. Final segment, tons of calls, lots of
[1:43:46.400 --> 1:43:50.960]  news, straight ahead. You worry. You see the signs and worry about the future. You worry about
[1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:55.040]  economic turmoil and food shortages. How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?

[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:15.440]  minimal. Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere. It's every bit organic and
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:19.840]  more nutritious than our modern diets. Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:24.480]  teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video with an emphasis on health, safety,
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:29.680]  practicality and joy. Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare,

[1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:03.520]  You know, I just told the guys, the controller, about something that I'm going to talk about this
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:09.520]  week on the air sometime. But I don't do it to be silly. I don't get into potty humor.
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:17.040]  It deals with the royalty of Europe and what scum they are and how low they think the public is.
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:26.080]  You can't make this stuff up. What's the name of that weekday show they've got that's only
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:29.520]  on for an hour? It's pretty funny. Let's do it. Todd and Don ought to give it to them.
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:38.960]  I shouldn't even get into it. The Queen of England, and it still goes on. They claim they stopped it
[1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:47.680]  in 1901. The Queen of England, I'm not even going to say it, man. If you Google it, it's mainstream news.
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:52.400]  I mean, guys at the office last night didn't believe it when I told them, so they Googled it.
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:01.600]  My wife knew about it because she was also a history minor when she went to school in France,
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:09.520]  and so she learned about the French royalty. You know what? I'm not even going to get into it. I
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:13.520]  was just joking around during the break with the guys, but the elite are such scum, ladies and
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:23.200]  gentlemen, that you can't even imagine the stuff that they're into. I'm not going to get into it.
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:29.040]  Maybe later this week when I have time to cover it and break it down. To give you an idea,
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:38.160]  Tutankhamun, one of the Pharaohs of Egypt, had an official nose picker, and I'm serious. He was so
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:43.920]  elite and he was God on earth, so someone had to pick his nose for him. Well, the royalty in England
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:49.360]  has a toilet attendant, and I'm just going to leave it at that. Let's just say they don't touch toilet
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:54.480]  paper with their own hands. It's taken care of by somebody else, and it's called the Groom of the
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:50:08.960]  Stool. There you go. You can't make this. Absolutely. I mean, that's how low they think of us, folks.
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:14.480]  Oh, man. All right, I had to give you a little bit of humor, folks, in all this craziness.
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:19.200]  But overall, we are positive. We believe if you expose all the siebel that's going on and expose
[1:50:19.200 --> 1:50:23.040]  how corrupt the elite are, this can be turned around. But somebody at the office was going,
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:27.840]  did you hear about New York Stockbrokers buying $2,000 pizzas made of caviar? And I said, man,
[1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:36.000]  that's nothing. Okay. Michael in Oregon. I'm sorry, Michael. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:41.920]  It's all right, Alex. That was pretty fun and stuff. Well needed. I'll call you for a few reasons
[1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:46.160]  today. One of them is to know what we're doing up here in Oregon and Washington,
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:51.200]  and another is to make you aware of something happening in New York. This is a coordinator
[1:50:51.200 --> 1:50:56.080]  for Campaign for Liberty. And I would encourage your listeners to maybe jump on board that ship.
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:51:00.000]  It's a wonderful network of... Right. You're plugging. Go ahead and plug quick,
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:03.600]  because I want to go to more calls. Oh, yeah. I was just letting you know that we're having
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:08.640]  good success in influencing our representatives and so forth in the area. Also, I wasn't sure if
[1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:15.040]  you were aware of it or not, but New York has started a sincerity test where parents using
[1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:22.320]  the religious waiver for vaccinations now have to appear in front of attorney to... He can decide
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:25.680]  whether or not they're sincere in their religious beliefs. Yeah. Yeah. Let's get this straight.
[1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:30.400]  First, there's no law you've got to take vaccines, but they say, oh, we want you to sign a religious
[1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:35.600]  or conscientious objector form. And so now they're trying to pressure people to make it
[1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:40.080]  with more fraudulent color of law that you've got to do this. Absolutely. Because more people
[1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:43.680]  aren't taking the vaccines now, no matter how many lies the media puts out. And so they're
[1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:48.240]  getting upset. I mean, I told you that the HPV shot was killing people that was in the trials,
[1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:53.440]  and now CBS News is having to admit it. I mean, you know, come on, folks. They only had four or
[1:51:53.440 --> 1:51:58.160]  five shots they tried to claim were mandatory decades ago, and now it's up to 60 shots they
[1:51:58.160 --> 1:52:01.360]  want to force you to take. There's no law. You don't have to take any of these shots.
[1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:06.480]  I mean, how would you trust a government in the media that lies and says it's the law when it's
[1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:12.880]  not? Now, let's talk to Ryan in Ohio. You're on the air, Ryan. Alex Jones, how are you?
[1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:16.640]  I'm pretty good, sir, but I don't have a, I don't have what the Queen of England has,
[1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:21.520]  so I don't feel like I'm really powerful. Absolutely. Actually, my name's Brian with a B,
[1:52:21.520 --> 1:52:27.440]  but that's okay. I'm calling to let you know I'm a police officer up here in Ohio in a county that
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:34.560]  has about, probably about three, four thousand police officers. And a lot of the police officers
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:40.880]  up here are very awake. A lot of them are very resistant to what's going on. Unfortunately,
[1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:46.880]  you know, some of our superiors aren't, but a lot of police up here are very awake. A lot of
[1:52:46.880 --> 1:52:53.440]  people are prepared up in this area. Hopefully nothing violent becomes of it, but I know every
[1:52:53.440 --> 1:52:58.880]  time the feds want to come in here and start doing this and doing that, we're, we're very resistant
[1:52:58.880 --> 1:53:05.360]  to it. So no, no, listen, I mean, the candidate they got the most military money was Ron Paul
[1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:09.600]  from the military. So the military's awake. And I, you know, I get in here and bash bad cops all
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:15.200]  day, but I'm bashing bad cops that the bad system won't go after. I know that most police
[1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:20.640]  are great men and women, but we need you guys to stand up and say no. I mean, they're openly
[1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:24.080]  announcing they're going to have regular army on the streets of America. I mean,
[1:53:24.080 --> 1:53:27.440]  when you say awake, I mean, are the police aware of what's happening?
[1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:33.920]  Oh yeah. I mean, there's a good percentage of them up here that know what's going on. I mean,
[1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:40.320]  I've turned hundreds on to you and your show and your effort. I mean, you know, info wars is on
[1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:45.920]  all the computers in the city and the favorites, you know, and it's driving people crazy. But
[1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:50.320]  as far as the military goes, I have some family members that are, that are fairly high up in
[1:53:50.320 --> 1:53:54.480]  the military. And they basically speak of the same stuff that you do. I mean, there's a,
[1:53:54.480 --> 1:53:58.880]  there's a small percentage of them that are dirt bags, but the overwhelming percentages
[1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:03.440]  is not going to stand. And that may be what saves us. The problem is the bankers, the private banks
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:07.920]  are in control of the money. So they're going to plunge us into a situation where the rioting is so
[1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:13.440]  bad that people will want troops on the streets and then the precedent set. But let me just say
[1:54:13.440 --> 1:54:18.320]  this, I've done a lot of damage in many respects to the movement. I'm not perfect. I've made a lot
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:23.520]  of mistakes. I get psychologically threatened by the police state. I get violated by bad cops.
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:28.400]  I see people getting violated. I lash out and then that makes police go more into that,
[1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:32.800]  that gang mentality and actually helps the new world order. So I say to the good police officers
[1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:38.000]  out there, I know you're there. I know you're the majority, but you can't blame me historically
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:43.280]  knowing that tyranny is here and that they're going to ask you to do these bad things incrementally.
[1:54:43.280 --> 1:54:48.480]  We're begging you to have courage and say no. And enough of you stand up, the new world order
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:52.320]  will back off. I mean, take five years ago when they ordered 14 million first responders,
[1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:58.400]  including all police, firemen and nurses and others to take the smallpox shot,
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:03.440]  you guys said no. So their whole forced inoculation program for the public fell apart
[1:55:03.440 --> 1:55:08.240]  because their own enforcers wouldn't do it. Exactly. And I'll tell you right now myself
[1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:11.600]  and most of the people that I talk to, they don't look at you as bashing. I mean,
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:17.360]  you ran rave, but we all ran rave and that's cool. That's what has to happen. Sometimes,
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:22.000]  you got to find, there's a lot of bogus stuff going on out there and there's a lot of good
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:27.520]  stuff. But unfortunately, the bogus stuff is the stuff that gets reported. Here's a funny
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:32.720]  note for you. We have a homeland security office and right next to homeland security,
[1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:40.480]  there's a big Illuminati bumper sticker. It's kind of comical. But hey, and I love your bumper
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:46.400]  music. You use like Fall Guy and stuff like that. See if your internet wizards can find a song. I
[1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:51.760]  can't remember who did it, but it was the battle at New Orleans. Oh no, we play that all the time.
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:56.720]  In 1814, we took a little trip. Now, I'm a Colonel Jackson in the mighty, Mississippi.
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:01.440]  We took a little bit. Right. It's difficult for me to catch it because I have to podcast
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:05.840]  because nobody here plays your show. And due to my work schedule, I can't listen while I'm at work.
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:12.480]  So I have to podcast and I listen to you every night religiously. I mean, my girlfriend's like,
[1:56:12.480 --> 1:56:16.960]  you better stop listening to him or I'm out of here, whatever. But it's like, yeah,
[1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:22.160]  I'm trying to tell her. Gun show was this weekend. I went out and I bought like 2000
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:27.600]  rounds of ammo and I'll tell you, the gun shows up here in Ohio. They're pretty good shows and
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:32.320]  they're packed. And I mean, just ammo is the thing that's just getting so hard to find. I mean,
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:36.880]  you go into the sporting goods stores here and nine millimeter and 45 are gone. I mean, it's
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:43.760]  not existent. You know, I mean, obviously I'm a gun guy and I tell everybody, you know, buy your
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:48.960]  storeable food, you know, don't take that income tax money and buy a new LCD TV. Go, you know,
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:54.080]  go get yourself a year's worth of food and buy as much ammo as you can, you know. Absolutely,
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:58.080]  sir. Good to hear from you. I appreciate your call. We're out of time. I want to try to jam in
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:04.080]  one or two final calls, but absolutely. Charles in Louisiana, you're on the air. How you doing?
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:06.800]  Good. Good to hear from you, Charles. Oh yeah, I've been listening to you every day,
[1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:10.400]  but I just can't get in some time, you know. Well, God bless you, Charles. I'll still pass
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:14.320]  out your tape, Mr. Jones. Charles was there during the gun confiscation in New Orleans.
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:18.640]  I want to tell them people that. Now, what that policeman said, there was a lot of policemen in
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:24.480]  New Orleans that knew too. I talked to my aunt, my uncle's a policeman. Policemen, they're gonna
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:30.480]  go where the money's at. They forced to do it because of food or a family. A lot of good policemen,
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:35.040]  but here's the thing. When the time comes, a policeman's gonna be a policeman, you know. I
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:39.440]  seen it in New Orleans. I was there. I've seen people get shot. I reported to you when it was
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:43.760]  police, when we were shooting innocent people off the bridge. Remember when I. You reported that. You
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:46.960]  reported everything to us because you were in the middle of it as an emergency worker before
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:51.200]  anybody. Good, but I just don't trust them when it comes down. They anxious to shoot. Now, by the
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:55.920]  way, they did convict those police that did shoot those people on the bridge that you broke on the
[1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:01.760]  show. You saw them, you know. But I ask people to still get your tapes, please. I don't call it
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:07.360]  as much because I gotta get you at night. But listen, parallel is the true word. Like TJ said,
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:12.640]  but I respect you and your tapes are true. They could never prove them wrong around here.
[1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:17.280]  Policemen have got them. I thank the policemen. A Carl on there. He's a wonderful officer.
[1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:22.960]  But Mr. Jones, we're headed to bad times. And these people better wake up and they better get
[1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:28.480]  some fury like you. You the only one, Carl, that's got fury. God bless you, my friend. Hey, I got
[1:58:28.480 --> 1:58:33.120]  fury because I love liberty and hate tyranny. We're out of time. Great job, crew. See you back
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:39.840]  on the weekday show. And next Sunday, spread the word. Hi, this is Ted Anderson introducing a new

[1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:12.800]  housing, medical, forcing Americans into poverty? Is free enterprise flawed or is our monetary
[1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:17.120]  system forcing us into a perpetual debt and ensuring inflation and higher taxes? The answers
[1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:20.800]  are in Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Ron Paul states it's what every American
