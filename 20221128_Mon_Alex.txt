[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  The best way I believe to counter misinformation and disinformation is to spread good information,
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  to spread science-based information, to have trusted voices.
[00:31.000 --> 00:38.000]  So I started my comments by reminding everybody that America's physicians, like the real leaders of American medicine,
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  the people you trust for your cancer care and your heart care and your pediatrics care,
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  are out there telling you you need to go get a vaccine.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  You can decide to trust America's physicians or you can trust some random dude on Twitter.
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  Like those are your choices.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  People are right to question whether this virus actually exists.
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  But we now in Europe for the first time have the scientific proof that it does not exist.
[01:04.000 --> 01:16.000]  And this is thanks to a Department of Health letter that has been received following a request by a citizen in the UK,
[01:16.000 --> 01:24.000]  which he actually had to appeal, but he requested the Department of Health and Social Care in the United Kingdom
[01:24.000 --> 01:33.000]  to give him scientific proof of the existence of a virus called SARS-CoV-2.
[01:33.000 --> 01:47.000]  And they confirmed that the Department of Health and Social Care does not hold any information on the isolation of a SARS-CoV-2 virus.
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  In other words, it does not exist.
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  Millions of people in China are once again under collective quarantine as the country faces the new surge of the COVID-19 virus.
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  In Beijing, workers in protective suits have installed metal barriers in some neighborhoods where coronavirus cases have been detected.
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.000]  People can only go out to buy food or receive medical treatment, and to do so, they must scan their health QR codes.
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  The Communist Chinese hellscape is the blueprint for what they plan to bring forward against us.
[02:18.000 --> 02:27.000]  But I wanted to be specific about where we're at and where they're going to take us with this system and how we can stop it and say no to it.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  You have the UN, you have the big corporate mouthpiece, the World Economic Forum.
[02:31.000 --> 02:38.000]  The Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  For decades, they've said they want to use a viral scare.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  The Rockefeller documents, Operation Lockstep, the list goes on and on.
[02:45.000 --> 02:54.000]  To bring in a world medical ID that will really be the world ID that will have carbon controls, not just viral controls,
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  on where you can do, what you can do, you'll have digital money by region that will be programmable.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  They'll decide where you can spend it, when you can spend it, how you can spend it.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  They can devalue it or upvalue it whenever they want.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  Swedish companies specialize in microchip implants,
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  promotes the use of their device to carry the COVID pass,
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  saying that the chip makes the data more accessible even if a person doesn't have their phone with them.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  The chip implant is placed in the arm and programmed so that when the chip is read by a smartphone,
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  it opens up a PDF file which contains a person's COVID passport.
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  This makes it easier for different entities to check the health status of the individual.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  And it's directly tied and administered to the surveillance over in live time by corporations,
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  bureaucracies and criminal think tanks like the ADL,
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  who will then reward you or punish you off of your social behavior
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  and then they will program it and incentivize it to spend it with their companies, their businesses, their systems.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  The ultimate brainwashing, the ultimate gaslighting as they announce all this tyranny,
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  then they say, but we can't talk about it, doesn't exist, while it publicly exists.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  So here it is, breaking G20 leaders issue joint declaration,
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  promoting global health passport to facilitate international travel,
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  a world ID to buy, sell and travel even outside your house.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  The social credit score, you will not leave one half foot out of your home unless you're authorized to.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  They've now built emergency centers all over the world in the UN Directives
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  that anyone that does not submit to forced injections and lockdowns in the future will be sent to these centers.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  They have now admitted in Canada and in Australia, but they're also setting them up here
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  and the UN is directing it again, that officially the camps aren't just for people they claim to have COVID
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  with their fake PCR test, but now it's for anybody protesting the future lockdowns
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  as they gear up for their next big push.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  While saying they want amnesty from us and for us to not sue them
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  or organize into groups that are saying no, so they can sucker punch us again.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[05:02.000 --> 05:08.000]  Info Wars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  Your chance to empower your body, your health, your immune system and more and keep us on the air win-win.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  The bad news is a bunch of our best selling products have already sold out
[05:17.000 --> 05:22.000]  and because of supply chain breakdowns, it'll be months and months until these great products come back in.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  X3 sold out. Our great American coffee blend has sold out.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  Biotrystallinium has sold out, but what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus,
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Whole Food Multivitamin,
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  Rain Force Ultra, Super Mill Vitality and so much more.
[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  So you've only got a few weeks to get these products at the lowest price you're ever going to find them.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  Don't fight the crowds. Don't fight the traffic.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  Don't do all your Christmas shopping in a month like a fool. Do it now.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  Get it all over with. Get a great deal. Keep Info Wars on the air while empowering your body.
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.000]  InfoWarsStore.com
[06:29.000 --> 06:36.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[06:43.000 --> 06:52.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  Hi, good friends and my enemies.
[06:57.000 --> 07:04.000]  Welcome to the broadcast, the most demonized attack applied about transmission on this planet.
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. It is Monday, November 28, 2022.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  We'll be here for the next four hours live ahead of the mighty Owen Schreuer,
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  3 p.m. Central with the War Room, again on the InfoWars radio slash TV network.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  Find the coordinates of Liberty at InfoWars.com, forward slash show, and band on video.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  Share those links.
[07:25.000 --> 07:31.000]  Okay, every major city in China for two weeks is having massive demonstrations,
[07:31.000 --> 07:37.000]  and most of the corporate media is demonizing the people that don't like to live under 100-plus-day lockdowns,
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  being welded into their houses while their homes burn up and the fire department doesn't even show up,
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  combat robots fly around in the skies, barking orders that scan your QR code on the highway on the street
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  and are directed off into their UN FEMA centers.
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  It is all a worldwide unified tyranny.
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  And even in some of the most elite areas of China and some of their most elite state-run universities,
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  we're seeing massive demonstrations of the children of the ruling Communist Party.
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  So this is Tiananmen Square 2.0.
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  And why is Xi Jinping, who's now been anointed dictator for life,
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  it's only happened once under the Communist Chinese, that was Mao Zedong,
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  why, again, elected by the dictatorship by the Pudocrats in the Central Committee,
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  why would he be squeezing and pushing?
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  If you understand that, you'll understand what's coming in the future,
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  because China is the model, and just last Thursday,
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  Klaus Schwab, the mouthpiece of the New World Order and the globalist Allied Combine with the Chaikombs
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  had this to say about the Chinese model.
[08:44.000 --> 08:53.000]  We have to define how the world should look like, which we want to come out of this transformation period.
[08:53.000 --> 09:04.000]  I respect China's achievements, which are tremendous over the last over 40 years.
[09:04.000 --> 09:15.000]  I think it's a role model for many countries, but I think also we should leave it to each country
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  to make its own decision what system it wants to adapt.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  And I think we should be very careful in imposing systems,
[09:25.000 --> 09:32.000]  but the Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries.
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  Now, two and a half years ago, we documented that Bill Gates, the Rockefeller Foundation,
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  the UN, the WEF, and Communist China were saying we're going to have a global vaccine passport
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  that's really the global passport, the digital ID, the central bank digital currency platform,
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  for the carbon tax, for the social credit score, and once they collapse the economy for build back better
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  and the great reset, they will then give you a universal basic income
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  because you won't be able to pay your bills or get a job.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  Even if you can get a job, it won't pay the bills.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  And so this is the transformation of the great reset they've been talking about.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  So China is the detonator set up by the globalist, empowered to take over the world,
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  given all the one-sided trade deals, given 98% control over Earth minerals,
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  putting a power position now to leverage the planet.
[10:22.000 --> 10:32.000]  On those Larry King live debates with Al Gore and Ross Perot in 1992, then again in 93,
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  he explained that there's a giant sucking sound.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  Ross Perot did that when Canada normalized and opened its border to trade to the U.S.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  and allowed competition with its wages.
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  I'm for competition, but it's a rigged system when another country isn't proportionate to you.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  It's a form of tariff.
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  And you have a sucking sound out of Canada into the U.S., which had just happened in the decade previous,
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  then you would then see a giant sucking sound to Mexico.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  But then that sucking sound would continue out of Mexico into China, into India,
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  and would actually lower the world standard of living massively,
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  not raise up the world standard of living.
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  That was actually the plan of the multinationalist at the trilateral commission that he warned about.
[11:17.000 --> 11:25.000]  And so China is a giant slave factory of a billion, 450 million people and is a giant beta test.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  And so instead of having soldiers marching around secretly arresting people
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  and torturing and beating and shooting people,
[11:31.000 --> 11:38.000]  it's paramilitary with their faces covered in medical garb using COVID as the pretext.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  There's almost no deaths from COVID.
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  Surroundable 99.99.7%, 99.99.99, plus percent.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  This is simply the cover for GGP.
[11:52.000 --> 11:59.000]  Ahead of revolutions, he knows is coming to artificially trigger one now so he can measure who's on his side,
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  track who's going to go along with the system,
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  force everyone onto the universal credit score and the whole AI face scanning QR code tracking system
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  and use that as the base camp, as they said two and a half years ago,
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  of this new world ID based on Chinese patents and Chinese technology
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  owned and run by GG Ping but given to him by Microsoft and Google.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  So it's official. Told you two and a half years ago, but just last month they came out and said,
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  yes, the UN and China are running the global model for the world ID
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  and the central bank digital currency.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  They want to make sure America and the West aren't ahead in that.
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.000]  They had FTX designed to blow all that up and suck down all the independent free crypto groups that are out there
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  and give government the pretext for regulation to shut down their competition
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  to make sure Communist China is supreme.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  There is a faction in the West that doesn't want China to be the leader,
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  but it is the minority faction and is not in power.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  The globalists are in league with the Communist Chinese and are doing everything they can
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  to legitimize and push this nightmare scenario.
[13:05.000 --> 13:13.000]  So when you see Communist China, you need to understand that that is exactly where you are going to be.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  Thousands of giant government camps, which they now admit are not for COVID patients,
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  but for political dissidents. The government goes out, puts people on lockdown
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  for over 100 days at a time.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  They start to rebel because they're starving to death.
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  It puts the state under pressure. GZPing sees who will follow draconian orders
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  and then he can expand his massive security state.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  That is their admitted battle plan.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  And you've seen Bill Gates, you've seen Klaus Schwab, you've seen them all say
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  Communist China is the model for the world.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  This is the blueprint for the planet.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  So what's happening with Chinese, ladies and gentlemen, is coming for us.
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  You notice Australia ran almost identical plans of New Zealand to what Communist China is doing.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  So this is a strategic, long-term plan that's going out of beta testing
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  into operational phase as we speak.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  Now, how do they think they're going to get this through in Europe, Canada, the United States,
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  New Zealand and Australia with their histories of free speech?
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  By outlawing free speech and demonizing free speech and saying words are weapons.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  When we come back from break, I'm going to look at the reports all over the world.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  Ireland, government plans to imprison people for possession of hate speech.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  Here's the new UN promotion.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  Words can be weapons. Hashtag no to hate with a hand grenade that is a keyboard.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  They're coming for all of your speech.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  We're going to be laying it all down and all out coming up next segment.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  Separately, we are running out of the free gifts at infowarstore.com.
[14:52.000 --> 15:00.000]  Books, films, t-shirts, sticker packs, coffee mugs, you name it.

[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  guaranteed because we estimate this morning we will be sold out

[16:00.000 --> 16:07.000]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people,
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  what was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3,
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  but if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin D3
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.000]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  for 50% off at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776.

[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  Men grow up to be like me, you're going to have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record,
[17:58.000 --> 18:02.000]  dedicated athletes who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[18:02.000 --> 18:09.000]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  The only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  The only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible.
[18:23.000 --> 18:28.000]  And that made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  Despite the massive law fair being waged against info wars.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  Despite the media defamatory libelist campaign against info wars.
[18:36.000 --> 18:43.000]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  is what keeps info wars on the air.
[18:45.000 --> 18:52.000]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.000]  So continue to do it.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  Go to places like info wars store.com.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  Go to the places like save info wars.
[18:57.000 --> 19:03.000]  Continue to keep info wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  Look at that. Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  That's because it's been denatured. It's been worked out.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  We didn't do that.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that this is the very best I can get.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  because I want that good will.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  Don't you get the big secret?
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[19:35.000 --> 19:45.000]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  Look it up.
[19:47.000 --> 19:53.000]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits that fish oil is incredible.
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.000]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products.
[20:01.000 --> 20:29.000]  Thank you.
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  Large multinational corporations allied with the dictatorships of the UN
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  run the leadership of the CIA. That's not my opinion.
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  And now the Carnegie Endowment former head publicly runs it.
[20:42.000 --> 20:48.000]  And it's come out in the news in the last few months that the CIA specifically illegally
[20:48.000 --> 20:54.000]  with the Justice Department is meeting with big tech, corporate dinosaur, legacy media
[20:54.000 --> 20:59.000]  and major corporations to set up a social credit score that's already being implemented by stealth
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  to basically debank you, harass you and later imprison you if you don't go along with them.
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.000]  So this is a real totalitarian takeover.
[21:07.000 --> 21:14.000]  And if you watch corporate media, you'll see it on MSNBC, CNN, ABC News, a new clip this weekend.
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  CIA analysts saying screw your free speech. It doesn't exist.
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  Elon Musk is allowing some freedom on Twitter as a Russian agent.
[21:23.000 --> 21:29.000]  These guys are just up there saying all of this.
[21:29.000 --> 21:36.000]  And it's absolutely disgusting and incredibly un-American.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  But that's what they're doing. We're going to get to that in a moment.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  But first, it's all over the world.
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  Ireland government plans to imprison people for possession of hate speech.
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  And what do they define that as? Not Nazi flags.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  We always said you ban those, nexus everything.
[21:49.000 --> 21:53.000]  Not the n-word. No. Denying transgenderism.
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.000]  Denying two men can have a baby. Denying open borders are a good thing.
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.000]  Questioning election fraud. Questioning lockdowns. Questioning force injections.
[22:01.000 --> 22:07.000]  It's all UN run. The UN said a month ago. They're head of global speech policy.
[22:07.000 --> 22:13.000]  Said, oh yeah, we run Big Tech. We create the orders, give it to their governments. They implement it.
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  So this is UN control.
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  Ireland government plans to imprison people for possession of hate speech.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  Here's the clip.
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.000]  The Minister for Justice is to strengthen the law against hate crimes and hate speech
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  with the aim of making it easier to secure convictions in the courts.
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.000]  Helen McInty said the proposed legislation would strike a balance between safeguarding free speech
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  and being victim-centered.
[22:39.000 --> 22:46.000]  Stanley Agusier vividly remembers when he came face-to-face with a stranger's hate in Dublin City Centre.
[22:46.000 --> 22:51.000]  Started yelling and calling me names using the n-word or leave this country.
[22:51.000 --> 22:56.000]  He even said that I hate you. The worst part was when he chose speech on me.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  The best thing I could do at that time was to leave that particular environment.
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  But leaving that environment, those words, those names didn't leave my mind.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  Ireland does not currently have hate crime legislation, but it is expected this year.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  Today the Minister for Justice said she was amending her approach to the long-promised bill
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  by including a demonstration test in addition to a motivation test
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  in order to make it easier to secure prosecutions.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  For a demonstration test is that you demonstrate hatred.
[23:25.000 --> 23:31.000]  So, for example, you might have somebody that leaves a bar. It could be an LGBTI bar, for example.
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  An individual follows them, is shouting homophobic slurs, and then attacks them.
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.000]  You are demonstrating by your words and your actions.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  We very much welcome the legislation.
[23:41.000 --> 23:47.000]  It is an area of focus for us because it is a pretty devastating crime for people.
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  Many civil liberties and minority groups welcome today's announcement,
[23:51.000 --> 23:57.000]  but some cautioned that they will be examining the published bill to ensure there is no impact on freedom of speech.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  The most important goal here, though, must not be to secure more convictions.
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  It must be to prevent hate crime happening and to assist our agencies, such as in Garethshire,
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  in shaping an effective response to the problem of hate crime.
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.000]  Under the provisions, new versions of existing offences attracting extra penalties
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  would be created if these offences were motivated by prejudice
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  against a protected characteristic of the victim.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  The new bill is set to be published in September.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  It could be enacted by the end of the year.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  John O'Sullivan, or Team News, the Department of Justice.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  And it's all run by the UN.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  Oh, someone claims you said something, don't even attack them, you get arrested.
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  Look at England, where if you post on Facebook the transgender flag and put them back to back,
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  it makes a Nazi swastika, you get arrested.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  But they don't respond to people being stabbed, robberies, murders, you name it.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  So this is the control, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  This is their larger plan.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  Words can be weapons.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  Hate speech online can lead to cruelty and violence in real life.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  The UN report says ban people's speech because it might make somebody do something bad
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  when they flood our countries with third-world populations filled with hate for us.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  If you criticize it, you get arrested.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  And for radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  It's a hang grenade that's made up of a keyboard, a pineapple hang grenade, fragmentation grenade,
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  that the fragmentation pieces are the letters, the evil terrorist letters of a keyboard.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  You've got to stop it.
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  Here's the report, Engage, United Nations, how to deal with hate speech.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  Here's the report.
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.000]  It continues.
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  CNN calls freedom of speech nonsense in rant accusing Elon Musk of being a Russian asset.
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  CNN peddled more fake news than usual Friday when a former CIA agent accused Elon Musk
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  of working on Russia's behalf by freeing up Twitter, calling free speech nonsense.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  Former CIA case officer Bob Baer has been on the show before, condemned Musk's recent decision
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  to grant General Amnesty to perform LeBan accounts claiming that exactly what Russian President
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  Vladimir Putin wants, all the debunked Russiagate crap.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  But now we've got to censor the American people because free speech is nonsense
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  because the CIA says so.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  We'll play that clip and then get to this.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  England's now outlawing the Bible.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  Here is the CIA on TV saying your first amendment's nonsense.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  Here it is.
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.000]  And it gets more and more challenging to discern what's real and what is, you know, misinformation
[26:34.000 --> 26:40.000]  or disinformation with deep fakes and with the sophistication by which some of these influence
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  campaigns are developed.
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  How do you discern what's real versus what's fake even, you know, in light of that sophistication?
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.000]  Well, that's why the pre-Musk Twitter had 7,000 people going through these accounts.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  You can pick them out with algorithms.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  You can pick them out by looking at them.
[26:59.000 --> 27:04.000]  You can check IPs and the rest of it and you simply block them.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  And it's not right.
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  And, you know, this freedom of speech is just nonsense because you can't go into a movie theater
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  and yell fire.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  It's against the law.
[27:12.000 --> 27:20.000]  What Putin's going to do and the Russians is they're going to use this as a vehicle to save himself in Ukraine.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  And, you know, whether it's going to work or not, I don't know.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  But we're going to see as soon as these restrictions come off, we're going to see the Russians all over it, as I just said.
[27:29.000 --> 27:39.000]  So if you had an opportunity to offer a piece of advice to Elon Musk or to counsel him or simply to send him a message, what would you say?
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  I'd say this libertarian nonsense is destructive to American national security.
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.000]  And he has got to re-institute the same restrictions that were on Twitter before he bought it.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  There is no other choice.
[27:53.000 --> 28:00.000]  That's enough. So there is the CIA operative saying we need to be like North Korea or communist China.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  Why don't you move there, Bob?
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  If it's so much safer and so much better, it's all made up.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  They're the ones that lied about the COVID virus.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  They're the ones that lied about its kill rate and yelled fire in a theater.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  They're the ones that pushed the deadly experimental shot.
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  They know it's killing people.
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  And now they're targeting newborn babies.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  Shame on you and Fauci.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  You're engaged in illegal domestic operations of the CIA using lies and deception against the American people, and it's all admitted.
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  And now this.
[28:26.000 --> 28:33.000]  Crown prosecution services says it's no longer appropriate to quote some passions from the Bible in public, including in your church.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  You will be arrested.
[28:37.000 --> 28:42.000]  Full article up on infowars.com, directly linked to the BBC.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  Now you can't read the Bible.
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  We're becoming communist China, the UK already is.
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  This is a multinational globalist conquering of the West.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  It's the New World Order.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  It's illegal.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  It's criminal.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  It's unpopular.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  And we must defeat it.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  Stay with us.
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.000]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  So now is the time to take action to support the info war and get the biggest sales of the year.
[29:22.000 --> 29:28.000]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTrue Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.000]  And now DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  They're all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.000]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.

[31:06.000 --> 31:11.000]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.

[31:21.000 --> 31:30.000]  Every order will get a free gift no matter how small or how big and it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.

[31:40.000 --> 31:46.000]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs, some of them are Alex Jones, Halloween masks, some of them are books, films,
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.000]  info wars flags, American flags, there are hundreds of different items.

[31:56.000 --> 32:00.000]  Free gifts for every order at infowarstore.com.
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[32:02.000 --> 32:06.000]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[32:06.000 --> 32:09.000]  There's a solution, the wellness company.
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.000]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the chief scientific officer.
[32:12.000 --> 32:23.000]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand, prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies,
[32:23.000 --> 32:34.000]  in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care,
[32:34.000 --> 32:48.000]  but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new world that we're living in.
[32:48.000 --> 32:55.000]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.
[32:55.000 --> 33:08.000]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[33:25.000 --> 33:45.000]  So I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you that there's an authoritarian, totalitarian, absolute criminal takeover taking place worldwide.
[33:45.000 --> 34:00.000]  And if we don't identify it as that and if we don't rally against it and call it what it is, it's so abhorrent, it's so evil, it will succeed because the general public just can't believe it's actually happening to them,
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  especially in countries that have a history of freedom, a history of liberty, a history of due process.
[34:05.000 --> 34:20.000]  And I've used this analogy many times, it's historic, the Galapagos Islands, 170 years ago or so, the first ship showed up there in the Pacific Ocean, off what is South America.
[34:20.000 --> 34:32.000]  And these big fat, juicy birds with more meat on them than a turkey had never had a predator, and so the sailors could walk right over to them and hit them on the head with an oar and eat them.
[34:32.000 --> 34:46.000]  And within a few years, all of the dodo birds, greet the term dodo or being stupid, all of the dodo birds, named that by the sailors, were extinct.
[34:46.000 --> 34:57.000]  We're like dodo birds, we've lived under freedom so long compared to other nations and have these checks and balances that they are now being removed, almost gone.
[34:57.000 --> 35:06.000]  And liberty taken is very hard to get back, the founding fathers warned us in history, history is replete with examples of that.
[35:06.000 --> 35:16.000]  And it's like Tucker Carlson said last Friday about the central bank digital currencies and the ESGs, they get those in place, it's over.
[35:16.000 --> 35:28.000]  Everything you do tracked, everything you do controlled, what you can buy, controlled by them, all tied to your behavior, all tied to your social score, in their own words, this is hell on earth.
[35:28.000 --> 35:38.000]  If you think the left side of control now, if you think Disney and Hollywood, the New World Order hates you now, and it's hurting you now, think again.
[35:38.000 --> 35:46.000]  So it started in Australia and Canada over a decade ago, preachers being arrested for reading scripture that's called hate speech.
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.000]  And now it's being adopted in blue cities across the United States, and here's an example out of the UK.
[35:52.000 --> 36:00.000]  Crown prosecution services says it is no longer appropriate to quote some Bible passages in public.
[36:00.000 --> 36:10.000]  The same by the UK's main prosecution service, that's their feds, says it's no longer appropriate to read parts of the Bible out in public, Christian groups have called the statement ill judged and concerning.
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  The Belfast newsletter has more.
[36:13.000 --> 36:20.000]  The story all stems from a competition between a man called John Dunn and a soldier turned evangelist and two lesbians.
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.000]  And it goes on to him two years ago quoting the Bible.
[36:25.000 --> 36:31.000]  Well, you don't have to listen to him if you disagree with him and let he without sin cast the first stone.
[36:31.000 --> 36:47.000]  But to come in and say we're going to federally prosecute you in the UK, in Scotland, in Northern Ireland, in England, in Wales, is a unified worldwide program.
[36:47.000 --> 36:54.000]  And it's everything we see going on in communist China.
[36:54.000 --> 37:04.000]  But when the Muslims are brought in and they actually physically attack people, the media covers it up when they attack the LGBT, because that's not part of the agenda.
[37:04.000 --> 37:12.000]  It's the well behaved indigenous populations of Europe that are being told you've got to roll over and you've got to fly the rainbow flag.
[37:12.000 --> 37:19.000]  You've got to submit to our political movement or you are involved in hate speech.
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  What did Trudeau say last week when he was on a drag queen show?
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  He said we can't just be tolerant. We've got to celebrate this and adopt this.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  But is it just men dressed like women? Hell, Bob Hope did that. I don't care if men want to go do that.
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  That's their free expression. I don't hate them. I don't even dislike them.
[37:37.000 --> 37:48.000]  But when you want to tie it to children and sexualize them in their own documents, that is evil beyond belief and is wrong.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  So that's some of the censorship news. And in fact, I want to play this clip in a moment. We played it last night.
[37:53.000 --> 38:04.000]  It's about two minutes, 15 seconds of Kanye West over the weekend saying he's really upset about the censorship, particularly Elon Musk refusing to bring me back to Twitter.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  But I've explained. I don't care about being back on Twitter.
[38:07.000 --> 38:20.000]  I care in general if Musk can bring back most people and have some semblance of freedom compared to the rest of the web because he can have the EU come after him, the ADL, the bureaucrats, the Justice Department.
[38:20.000 --> 38:30.000]  As Biden said days after I warned of that two weeks ago, Biden said we're criminally basically investigating Elon Musk as a Russian spy.
[38:30.000 --> 38:39.000]  And you just saw a high-level CIA operative on television saying Elon Musk is a Russian agent with no evidence because he allows some free speech.
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.000]  So I get the fact that Musk has bitten off a lot. He had to throw me under the bus to try to get him some cover with these people.
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  I think that was a little bit out of line.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  But whatever, I've got bigger fish to fry, folks. We're way past censorship now.
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  We're going into the debanking phase. We're going into the arrest phase. We're going into the disappearance phase.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  We're going into the worldwide collapse phase.
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.000]  And we're all going to be facing the exact same stuff you see in communist China in the near future.
[39:09.000 --> 39:22.000]  That's why we've got to get ahead of this now, organize our political movements and our awakening so we know what is already hitting us, the leading edge, and what is coming behind in the bigger maelstrom.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  So I'm going to get to that yay west clip here in just a moment.
[39:26.000 --> 39:33.000]  And then a Jimmy Dork clip as well, where he lays out what Elon Musk is really up to.
[39:33.000 --> 39:42.000]  But first, I wanted to get to this because you talk about tyranny, as I've explained a thousand times, this is a lot bigger than Alex Jones.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  So I want to spend a few minutes on this because it affects everybody.
[39:46.000 --> 39:52.000]  We now know in hindsight it was worse than we thought with the Sandy Hook PR situation.
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  Barely ever covered it. Hillary runs against Trumps, taken out of context clips of what I said that I had a right to say.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  As soon as they get me to come out and say, listen, I'm not sending people to your houses. I'm not really that big a guy on this.
[40:04.000 --> 40:13.000]  I think it probably happened. Then the PR firms, the PR firm that runs the UNPR, soon the news now, that they've been bragging for over a month,
[40:13.000 --> 40:20.000]  hype up that I'm being mean to the kids and saying it didn't happen and sending people to their houses for a year to make it a big issue.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  People think I'm doing that to then sue me.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  Then they sue me. There's no evidence of what they said being true.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  So two different judges and Democrat jurisdictions find me in default and say I'm guilty.
[40:32.000 --> 40:42.000]  Then they tell a jury, two juries, I'm guilty and get a billion, 400 plus million dollar judgments all together to break our will and make us think we've all been defeated.
[40:42.000 --> 40:53.000]  Then they lie with the PR firms going through the record, going through the depositions to make up outlandish stories to make listeners think we've got plenty of money
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  so you stop supporting claiming I have hundreds of millions of dollars when I don't have a million dollars.
[40:57.000 --> 41:03.000]  Then they put out lies like Jones gives $100,000 a week to his personal trainer.
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  Sounds insane. Couldn't make that up. It's too weird. It is completely made up.
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  They went and looked at the guy that runs the shipping company for us. He owned a wait machine company.
[41:13.000 --> 41:22.000]  There's nothing to do with us. So because he has a degree from UT in kinesiology, they go, oh, his personal trainer gets $100,000 a week.
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  That was what we were spending on shipping every week that you were paying for.
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  So that's the level of lies. But here's the big one of thousands.
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  This was all synthetic. They hyped it up. They made it this big issue.
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  I wasn't ever suspended on Twitter for Sandy Hook, as Elon Musk said, because it wasn't on the radar then.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  It wasn't being discussed in 2017.
[41:44.000 --> 41:51.000]  Judge, this is the New York Times, judge upholds 49 million verdicts against Alex Jones despite CAP.
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.000]  Now, in Texas law, these lawsuits are capped at 5 million. It's the law.
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  18 years ago, famous tort reform, the model of almost 40 states, 39 states have adopted it.
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.000]  Texas tort reform, 18 years old, about to be 19 years old next month, 19 year old law law.
[42:09.000 --> 42:16.000]  She said, I don't care in her ruling last week, two weeks ago, what the what the law is, this is unconstitutional.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  He will pay the whole 50 million. 5 million is the same as 50 million. I don't have it.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  So that's a non issue, except she literally on her Facebook has blue hair.
[42:25.000 --> 42:32.000]  She literally is a hardcore leftist antifa supporter. And she says, I don't care what the law says.
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.000]  Alex Jones will pay the whole amount because they're lawless. Just like she defaulted me.
[42:37.000 --> 42:42.000]  Now she says she doesn't care. I got to pay the full amount outside of law.
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.000]  These are criminals involved in revolution against our freedom through the judiciary.
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  Not all judges are like this. Look at written analysis, judge. That was a fair real judge.
[42:51.000 --> 42:56.000]  But that's the level of the control and they're coming for you next. We got to stop this now.
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  We'll be right back. Huge news on the other side. Stay with us.
[43:00.000 --> 43:09.000]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter
[43:09.000 --> 43:16.000]  because of something called vapors. They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[43:16.000 --> 43:21.000]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin D3.
[43:44.000 --> 43:49.000]  And we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload in your body

[44:07.000 --> 44:14.000]  The Bible says, let another mouth praise you. I'm going to do that right now. Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.000]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[44:19.000 --> 44:25.000]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.000]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[44:34.000 --> 44:40.000]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Kasta, super Tim Kast IRL.
[44:40.000 --> 44:48.000]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  We need to support free speech systems right now. So go check out the store. Go support their store.
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.000]  Go support info wars. Leave a donation right now. Don't wait until they're gone.
[44:58.000 --> 45:05.000]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[45:05.000 --> 45:12.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good.
[45:16.000 --> 45:22.000]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with X2. You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[45:22.000 --> 45:29.000]  So I took it and man, in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  You know, I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[45:39.000 --> 45:45.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[45:45.000 --> 45:46.000]  It's amazing. It works.
[45:46.000 --> 45:52.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[45:55.000 --> 46:17.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  To empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  Introducing top G supplements.
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and his crew.
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  Now you have the chance to benefit in body, mind and soul with the same supplements that Andrew Tate takes himself.

[46:55.000 --> 47:01.000]  Men grow up to be like me. You're going to have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record, dedicated athletes who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[47:01.000 --> 47:14.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.000]  We're going to have open phones in the second hour.
[47:36.000 --> 47:43.000]  And then the excellent investigative journalist we've been interviewing for the 15 years, Dan Dix.
[47:43.000 --> 48:00.000]  He makes the best job with all this breaking news about major fashion firms openly promoting pedophilia that's been one of the top stories in the last week and a half.
[48:00.000 --> 48:08.000]  So that's all coming up into the third hour with the Balenciaga situation and more.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  But let's just get back to what I've been covering this hour.
[48:11.000 --> 48:26.000]  The CIA at the top left us run has been involved heavily since its founding in 1947, but massively since the killing of JFK, that came out in the late 70s, Frank Church committees.
[48:26.000 --> 48:36.000]  And then at a whole other level under Obama, right through Trump, who didn't have control, they were working against him the whole time, and then exploding under Biden.
[48:36.000 --> 48:44.000]  And it's now coming out and saying all over the news, screw your free speech, screw you, you're all Russian agents.
[48:44.000 --> 48:49.000]  If you don't want to take shots, if you don't want open borders, if you don't want devalued currencies, you're Russians.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  We have to censor you for national security.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  That's what Bob Baer said earlier when I played it.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  That your freedom is nonsense.
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  That's a quote.
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  Your freedom is nonsense.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  It's supposed to protect our freedom, huh, buddy?
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.000]  The big threat historically, going back to Rome, and even before that, would be your own security forces taking over.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  Look at China.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  Look at Venezuela.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  Look at Cuba.
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  Look at North Korea.
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.000]  Look at Germany and the Nazis.
[49:20.000 --> 49:25.000]  And it's happening again, and these paid stuges are up there on TV.
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.000]  So we knew this, and we knew there was funding by big billionaires against me and the whole Sandy Hook thing.
[49:32.000 --> 49:41.000]  But remember, they ran thousands of articles a week for five years, for a year before they sued me, saying, I'm a Sandy Hook man, and I've got to be censored.
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.000]  And they now admit it's a blueprint to censor everybody else with weaponized judiciary.
[49:46.000 --> 49:55.000]  Now, I knew that back at the time, but then when they had their fake judgment with their rigged jury, the judge already said I was guilty.
[49:55.000 --> 50:07.000]  Two days after that first billion-dollar verdict, then the judge said, oh, another 400-something million, comical at that point, because I don't have, again, a million dollars laying around.
[50:07.000 --> 50:15.000]  The PR firm came out and said, we secretly ran this whole thing a year before they sued me, hyping it up, making it about Alex Jones.
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  Working at a Democratic Party, misconstruing what I said, putting out edited clips, hyping it.
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  Oh, it's the families. They're upset. I'm like, hey, I barely covered this. I think your kids died.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  I didn't see people in their houses. Okay, I'm sorry. Stop saying I didn't understand what was happening.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  Then they go, oh, you admit it. You admit you lied.
[50:33.000 --> 50:39.000]  Then the judge finds me guilty, so then they can put on these show trials in Texas and in Connecticut, where our hands are tied.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  We can't defend ourselves. We can't put on evidence. People say, why aren't your lawyers doing a better job? They're there in a show trial.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  You see, why did you show up? Well, because we've got to do that for the appeal.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  Because if you don't, they win.
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  So if they set this precedent, it's game over.
[50:54.000 --> 51:03.000]  And then now the PR firm brags about all this, but the main PR firm for the United Nations, look it up.
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  It's incredible.
[51:06.000 --> 51:16.000]  So when you see this headline, Judge upholds 49 million verdicts against Alex Jones despite CAP. The CAP is the law, but it gets worse.
[51:16.000 --> 51:21.000]  She then ruled a week and a half ago, right before Thanksgiving.
[51:21.000 --> 51:26.000]  She then ruled no one's ever done this in Texas history anywhere else.
[51:26.000 --> 51:32.000]  She let the lawyers, the plaintiffs lawyers, the ambulance chasers, the Democratic Party operatives,
[51:32.000 --> 51:38.000]  announce a bunch of new stuff, crimes I'd committed, crimes against the elderly, abuse of the elderly.
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  What does that even mean? That's what they said. Look at the ruling.
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  They're not even involved so that some other weird stuff kicks in and criminal clauses kick in.
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  And the judge said, yes, I find these guilty of that too.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  So she finds me guilty. She tells the jury I'm guilty.
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.000]  They lie about how much money I've got and say I have $400 million.
[51:57.000 --> 52:07.000]  So the jury says, well, we'll give you 20% of his wealth, which is $50 million, which is 20, 30 times my wealth.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  All lies upon lies.
[52:09.000 --> 52:16.000]  So she finds me guilty, rigs the jury to find out how guilty I am, lies about the financial numbers.
[52:16.000 --> 52:23.000]  And then after the trial, at the judgment phase, she lets them come in and say he's also guilty of all these things.
[52:23.000 --> 52:29.000]  She says, yes, I retroactively find that the jury found him guilty of that.
[52:29.000 --> 52:39.000]  People reading this, even top law firms that didn't want to touch Alex Jones, the 10-foot pole, didn't understand what this is,
[52:39.000 --> 52:48.000]  now are waking up and now about to take action because they're like, oh my God, you can't do that.
[52:48.000 --> 52:56.000]  You can't retroactively, after the judge finds you guilty and a jury finds you guilty because the judge says you're guilty,
[52:56.000 --> 53:03.000]  then add stuff that was not before the jury and say I'm guilty of that, abusing old people.
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.000]  She said he's guilty of a criminal act.
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  It wasn't even a criminal trial.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  People say this doesn't make sense.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  People can't believe it. They can't imagine it.
[53:14.000 --> 53:19.000]  Like in prison saying two women had a baby, no, a man raped a woman who says he's a woman.
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.000]  Or there's 55 genders, you're like, none of this is true.
[53:24.000 --> 53:30.000]  It's meant to make you just psychologically give up and go into a catatonic state, but we're not going to.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  They're trying to completely overwhelm us.
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.000]  But it's not about Alex Jones complaining. It's not about me being a victim here.
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.000]  It's about everybody understanding just how hardcore these people are and how there's no rules
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  and they're going gangbusters at every level because the world's awakened to globalist
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  and the whole Anglo-American establishment and the neoliberals and they're being rejected
[53:54.000 --> 54:00.000]  so they're a corrupt, dying political system clinging to power and trying to keep control.
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  Now I'm going to give the number out.
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  The start of the next hour, I'm going to take a bunch of calls.
[54:04.000 --> 54:08.000]  Hell, I'm going to give it out right now.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  On any subject you want to cover.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  But I'm going to give you the new Kanye West clip.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  I'm going to get to Fauci and the huge COVID news.
[54:15.000 --> 54:26.000]  I told you this was coming and I warned Trump and I even got Trump warned again last week
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.000]  and I said, they're going to blame you for the deadly shot.
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.000]  I've been telling Trump this for over two years and now Fauci came out and said,
[54:33.000 --> 54:39.000]  Trump covered up the origin of where it came from and Trump gave people the poisonous shot
[54:39.000 --> 54:46.000]  and he said, there'll be no investigation of me because Trump green-lit it all.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  You knew that was coming.
[54:48.000 --> 54:54.000]  I've said it over a thousand times on air the last two years and now, ladies and gentlemen,
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.000]  they've done it bigger than Dallas.
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.000]  Meanwhile, the British Medical Journal came out two weeks ago and said this is the biggest
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  medical crime in history.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  The shots don't work and are killing people en masse.
[55:08.000 --> 55:13.000]  The British Medical Journal, zero news coverage.
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.000]  But the scientists are covering their ass because they know this is serious,
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.000]  Nuremberg level, Joseph Mengele on steroids garbage.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  This is a big deal.
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  This is a big, big, big, big deal.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  So I'm going to hit all that first.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[55:31.000 --> 55:41.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  First-time callers, give you a chance to get on.
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  First-time callers only, 877-789-2539.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  Let's give first-time callers a chance.
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  877-789-2539.
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  Now, I got some good news.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  I got some bad news.
[55:57.000 --> 56:03.000]  I thought we had enough free gifts of books and films and T-shirts and DVDs and all the rest of it
[56:03.000 --> 56:09.000]  with every order to keep it going at least until early December.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  Sorry, Ken.

[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  Thank you so much for your support. God bless.
[58:50.000 --> 58:57.000]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness Company.
[58:57.000 --> 59:08.000]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[59:08.000 --> 59:17.000]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[59:17.000 --> 59:26.000]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID,
[59:26.000 --> 59:32.000]  vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[59:32.000 --> 59:41.000]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[59:41.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the Wellness Company.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  The Canadian government in British Columbia is trying to pass legislation that will recreate how oversight bodies regulate health care and alternative medicine.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Certain details of this legislation are undisclosed and will remain so until the government passes it into law.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  But what we do know about Bill C-36 is bad enough.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  This bill gives the government of British Columbia the power to mandate vaccines for any illness the government so chooses.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  It gives the government the power to censor anyone who challenges their narrative on anything,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  allowing the government power to seize an individual's property, find them for up to $200,000, and throw them in jail.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  It creates a system of classification wherein the government decides who has good character and who doesn't.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  It redefines the meaning of informed consent.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  And while it has not been made official yet, the Canadian Psychiatric Association is now targeting everyone who refuses the dangerous mystery vaccines,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  labeling them as mentally insane, an age-old tactic of tyrants, throw the dissidents into mental asylums and medicate them.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  And you've talked about how even they recommend, you know, perhaps psychiatric medication or something for people that don't want to take a vaccine.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  So this has come out recently out of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  The College sent out a letter or a memo to all the doctors in Ontario suggesting to them,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  now so far they're not mandating it, they're just suggesting it, that any of their unvaccinated patients,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  that they should consider that they have a mental problem and that they should be put on psychiatric medication.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  So far it's just a suggestion, but the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario should not be making these kinds of suggestions.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  This is extremely unethical and this is a very, very slippery slope.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  If they're suggesting that people who wish to have bodily autonomy and don't want an experimental vaccine, that there may be something mentally wrong with them,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  that is a very, very dangerous slippery slope that we're on.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  This is what the website of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario says.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  It says, quote, it is also important that physicians work with their patients to manage anxieties related to the vaccine and not enable avoidance behavior.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  In cases of serious concern, responsible use of prescription medications and or referral to psychotherapy are available options.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  Overall, physicians have a responsibility to allow their patients to be properly informed about vaccines and not have those anxieties empowered by an exemption.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  So my verdict is, wow, yes, this is in fact a true claim.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  This is what the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario is telling doctors, that if a patient has declined the COVID-19 vaccine,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  they are not to quote, unquote, empower that patient with an exemption, that the declining of the vaccine is automatically labeled as an irrational anxiety.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  And the recourse for that in the eyes of this medical organization is prescription medications and or psychotherapy.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  They want to drug you to trick you into taking the COVID vaccine.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  The left have wised up to this.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  The social media giants, and they are.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  So far, the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host, Alex Jones.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free-fressed, working with Big Tech.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  In a free country, everyone can be heard. Into talentarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  I've got some good news and bad news. Infowars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.

[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  X3 sold out. Our great American coffee blend has sold out. Biotrycellinium has sold out. But what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Mineral Fusion,
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Whole Food Multivitamin, Rain Force Ultra, Super Mill Vitality, and so much more.

[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  InfowarsStore.com.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  We're now into hour number two. Remember, evil forces are literally working around the clock to keep you from missing the show and keep you from sharing this broadcast.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  So however you can, you're smart. Share it. Spread it. Get it out there.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Okay, your phone calls are coming up, but I wanted to get into the COVID news here because Anthony Fauci knows he's going to get called up before the House.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  At least the Republicans got control of that. They're bringing up the gain of function, which he lied about.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  He said there is no gain of function when he specifically all these documents calls a gain of function.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  Not just at Wuhan, but Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Boston, Massachusetts, they produce COVIDs that kill 80% of humans that catch it.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  I mean, how insane is that? And so he went on Face the Nation on CBS this weekend and said, hey, I'm not going to be investigated.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Trump covered up the origin of COVID because they got Trump to sign on to all this.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  They're going to blame him as how deadly this is begins to come out.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  It was so clear this was going on. We called it from the start.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  Tomorrow's news today. Here is Joseph Mengele, 2.0 Fauci.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  What happens is that if you look at the anti-China approach that clearly the Trump administration had right from the very beginning and the accusatory nature,
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  the Chinese are going to flinch back and say, oh, sorry, we're not going to talk to you about it, which is not correct.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  But they're not talking to the Biden administration about it either.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  Exactly. I think that horse is out of the barn and they're very suspicious of anybody trying to accuse them.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  We need to have an open dialogue with their scientists and our scientists, keep the politics out of it and let the scientists,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  because these are scientists that we've known for decades.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  Oh, yeah, the good communist Chinese. He goes on again about Trump.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  He goes on to talk about the Republicans that they politicized COVID absolute garbage.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  So Fauci defends China for covering up origins and then blames Trump for it.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  Now, here's some of the news today on the COVID front.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  Three runners suffer heart attacks.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  125 others require medical attention following Spanish half marathon.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  Never before happened.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  Can't even run 12 miles about a heart attack.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  Louisiana AG slams Fauci if you're not answering questions during deposition about us handling him COVID-19 says he remembers nothing.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  Couldn't recall much.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  Pfizer CEO in trouble by regulator for making misleading statements about children and vaccines and claiming the vaccines worked.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Another study finds heart inflammation higher among Moderna vaccination users and Pfizer's is Moderna is just four times stronger than the Pfizer exact same shot.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  We've all been saying that day one COVID-19 researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues and Pfizer's vaccine trial.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  They covered up the real damages being caused by it.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  As an oncologist, I'm seeing people with stable cancer rapidly progress after being forced to have a booster.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  One of the studies already show.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  Canadian Psychiatric Association targets anti-vaxxers.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  If you say the vaccine doesn't work or has low efficacy, they say drug you and put you in a mental institution.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  You know it's a fact.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  Medical Journal claims anti-vaxxers causing deadly clots in people, in vaccinated people by scaring them about the danger of vaccines.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  Wow.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  U.S. military biological activities that threaten the world says Russia.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  They're on and on.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  Woman dies allegedly after COVID booster daughter in shock.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Buddha judge was out again last Friday saying the shot protects you from COVID.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Just take it a total lie.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  Total fraud.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  Teach death three weeks after Pfizer vaccine triggers investigation.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  Post admits that COVID is now a pandemic of the vaccinated.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  They're now putting out antigen test in the U.S. and worldwide that count flu as COVID-19.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  Remember how flu went to zero during the first two years of COVID?
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Now it's back.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  Now they're calling flu influenza A and B COVID on the test.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Total fraud in your face.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  Federal government sues doctor for 500 billion for being right about COVID vaccine and alternative treatments.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  See it's not just Alex Jones.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  They're coming after everybody.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  So that's the news on that front.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  I want to talk about Fauci.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  An arrogant, monstrous person.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  You know, I don't really like horror movies because I've seen enough real horror in my life that I don't think it's cute or funny.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  They've got popular shows like Dahmer.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  I haven't watched it, but I've read the reviews.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  And people are so shocked by him kidnapping people and injecting them with stuff to turn them into sex slaves.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  The brain damaging them with injections in their brains of chemicals.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  But when you look at what Fauci is doing, it's on a scale hundreds of millions of times bigger and he radiates evil and arrogance.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  And he's up there just laughing at everybody.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  And he has this 45 year history of being an evil mad scientist that loves to kill people.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  That's why he was chosen by the eugenicists.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  And you look at him and it's hard to look at him because he is literally the devil incarnate.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  He is a monster beyond monsters.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  And he's part of the Bill and Melinda Gates depopulation fund.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  That's the real name of their foundation.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  We can play clips of their award ceremonies where they give awards under that name.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  He says there's too many people.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  He says he wants you to die.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  Now take this shot.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  Folks, we've got to wake up to this fact.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  And that's why I raised this last hour.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Not because it's about me.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  Because it's about you, that judge in Texas that found me guilty, had a show trial, told the jury just to find out how guilty I was.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Said the $49 million verdict against Alex Jones stands despite the law that is a cap.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  The New York Times says Texas law caps punitive damages at two times economic damages plus $750,000 per plaintiff at $5 million.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  Which a lawyer for Mr. Jones, Andina Rainel, has predicted would limit the award so far.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  And the jury's verdict.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  It's the law.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  But in hearing last two Tuesdays ago, Judge Maya Guerra-Gamble of the District Court in Travis County, where InfoWars is based,
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  questioned the constitutionality of the cap and called the verdict a rare case.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  So she said, I don't care what the law says, he owes that.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  That's breaking the law, just like she did with her fake default judgment, claiming I didn't give them evidence.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  Now it's completely naked, but she went further.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  She said in last Tuesday, not Tuesday before last, she said at the end, they put forward paper saying, well, the jury didn't hear the evidence.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  But we want to say, because one of these plaintiffs is an old person, that it's elder abuse and a crime.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  She said, yes, I convict Alex Jones, not a jury, I judge convict him of elder abuse.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  And so I guess they now got the District Attorney involved or something.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  He thought prosecutors brought charges.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  You thought, no, no, no, judges do.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  She said, you are guilty of elder abuse after the trial, the show trial.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  So I didn't get a trial.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  I got a show trial.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  She found me guilty.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  And people are shocked by this.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  This has finally gotten a lot of people's attention in the legal world.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  That's what I keep warning people about over and over again.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  This is not a game.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  You saw the article I read about a mainline doctor that exposed the shots weren't working.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  Many people sick.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Put on info.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  So the federal government's suiting for $500 billion.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  That number's meant to scare you.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  Alex Jones, 1.4 billion.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  Oh, you're 500 billion.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  The doctor doesn't have a million dollars.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  It's just meant to sound so overwhelming that you just give up.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  It's all Wizard of Oz.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  It's all PR firms and the CIA.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  It's a desperate power structure hiding behind these lawyers, hiding behind these plaintiffs.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  I'll just tell you a point of blank.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  I'm very proud to be in this fight and proud to be on air battling this with you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  Now, I said I'd get to the Kanye West clip and I said I'd get to the Jimmy Dore clip that are very important.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  The tie and all this free speech attack.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  But I'm going to do that.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  I'm going to do that in the third hour when Dan Dix is on with me.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  I'm going to set this aside because your calls are the most important.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  You bring up amazing topics.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  You can take us at angles.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  We wouldn't have gone in.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  I love the wild card nature.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  I love poker.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  I love blackjack.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  It's just the randomness of it and all the great points you make.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  So when we go to break in 20 seconds, 25 seconds, I'm going to come back and go right to your calls.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Joe and Will and Jaden and Matt and Joe and Anthony and Haiti, Heidi and Looney and Josh and Brian.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  All your calls are straight ahead on the other side.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  But remember who they really fear.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  It's you, the people.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  It's we, the people.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  So share the live feed in FullWars.com forward slash show and a video.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  Take clips out of the show.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  Share them.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  Email everybody the live show.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  God bless you.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  So now is the time to take action to support the info war and get the biggest sales of the year.

[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  So many other great products like Ultimate Creole Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret 12.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  They are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at infowarstore.com.

[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalist.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  He is consecutively the most Googled man in the world in the last two years.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  And that's because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.

[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  dedicated athletes who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  Why is this taking so long?
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  Why can't we do this here?
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  If we don't fix the system.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  It doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  People need to get behind info wars.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  We need more of this communication.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  The globalists want a worldwide biomedical tyranny as the smoke screen
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  to begin their world ID, the social credit score.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  The thing standing in their way is free speech.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  That fails the second amendment.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  That's why they're also coming after your guns.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  Biden says he wants to ban all semi-autos as of last week.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  Very serious times.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  Let's go to Joe in West Virginia.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  You're on the air.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  Welcome, sir.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  Hello, Alex.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  I've been a listener for about 10 years now
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  and been buying all your products for five years.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  Thank you.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  They're superior.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  So whoever's on the ledge, just go ahead and jump on in
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  and buy all these products.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  Thank you.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  Joe, I didn't hang up on you, Joe.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  Are you there?
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  All right. Sorry, Joe.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  Call back. We'll get you back on air.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  Let's talk to Matt in Canada.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing?
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  Good, sir. Go ahead.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  So, yeah, this radical totalitarian liberal government
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  we have in Canada wants to ban semi-automatic
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  centerfire magazine-fed guns.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  Now, notice they just banned the sale of guns a month ago
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  with an executive action by Trudeau,
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  who says he admires dictatorship of China.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  And now they're going to come after the guns themselves, of course.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  That's right.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  So they banned handguns,
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  and now they're trying to slip an amendment into ban even more guns.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  And it was supposed to be magazine-fed semi-automatic centerfire guns.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  When I go into the gun store,
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  there's both action hunting rifles banned,
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  two-fed semi-automatic shotguns,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  and even rimfire-22s that are banned.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  So anybody in Canada listening to this
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  that's thinking about going and getting a gun,
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  they better go right away
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  because there's going to be way more gun than what's on their list.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  And, of course, that's because they got big plans for Canada.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  They want to break your will
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  and bring you into the new world order,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  just like Gigi Ping's doing in China right now.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  Exactly.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  They want to disarm everybody of all weapons.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  Well, look at how he's banning peaceful protests in your country.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  Are Canadians starting to wake up?
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  Or what's happening?
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  Some are, but the brainwashing program has been in for so long
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  that people just can't come back from it.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  I hear you, brother. God bless you.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  I'm sorry. That's the case.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  But they're going to learn that submitting a tyranny
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  is a lot bigger cost than fighting it.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  Anthony, in New Jersey, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  Alex.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  My only regret, my only regret is I didn't hear of you sooner.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  I love you, brother. Good to have you on board.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  What's on your mind?
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  On my mind is Sandy Hook and the parents of Sandy Hook.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  It seems to me like it's a fraud on the lawyers,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  but their lawyer's part is fraud
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  because they knew in advance what you were worth.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  And yet they promised them a billion dollars,
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  however that works, if they promised them,
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  if they put it in writing that we know he's only worth two million
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  and we're going to assume for a billion or 964 million,
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  well, that's just fraud.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  Well, the families have already gotten 73 million from Remington.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  They've already raised reportedly over $100 million in charity.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  So a lot of them have come out and said, we want him off air.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  We don't want money.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  So they're on board.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  This is all a deep state action hiding behind these families.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  It's all been run by PR firms. It's all confirmed now.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  It's all a giant sigh-up on the American people.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  Wow, they're all bought already.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  Well, I mean, maybe some of them are just ignorant.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  I can't judge the heart. Only God can do that.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  I just know that I wasn't brought off Twitter about Sandy Hook.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  I wasn't covering it for years and years and years before they sued me.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  I talked about it.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  They made me that because I'm a populist leader.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  They're predicting the new world order.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  So they've got to demonize me.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  So they just picked this topic to blow it up and make it giant.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  Let's go to Will and Marilyn. Will, go ahead.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  Yeah.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  Yes, sir. Welcome.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  Yeah, I'm calling.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  It's not a spike protein.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  They're nano carbon tubes.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  If you go to rumble, there's a video called Karen Kingston.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  People are connected to do not do not demonic realm.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  They're COVID-19.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  Let me just let me be very clear with you.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  I've had a bunch of top scientists on top research doctors.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  I had Dr. Peter McCullough on three weeks ago.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  It's in the mainline studies because everybody goes off kind of like people's speculation.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  It's it's it's it is a self the spike protein is a synthetic nanotech
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  self replicating protein prion similar to what causes mad cow disease.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  What you're saying is mainline science admitted.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  So why are they trying to colonize us with these spike proteins that take over the body?
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  Please listen to me.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  It's not spike proteins.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  They're carbon nanotubes and they feed off of 5g frequencies.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  Okay.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  This is why they're turning all the blight the lights blue the street lights.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  Okay.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  I have the patent applications for it.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  You know, here's the deal, sir.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  I'm going to talk to you.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  I'm going to talk to you again.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  What they call a spike protein is a nano protein.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  So we're saying the same thing.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  Let me give you an example.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  Everybody calls the the the the the the the streaks in the sky chemtrails.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Well, a lot of those are actual ice crystal condensation from jets.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  So that then discredits it all when I have the CIA, the documents, the department of energy
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  admitting massive geoengineering is going on.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  They're using electromagnetic fields from the Doppler radar towers under patents to energize
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  nuclei in the atmosphere, not just what planes are putting out with chemicals.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  Sometimes they have special planes that go out and spray and do things to hurricanes
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  or their weather fronts to control them.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  But in general, they're using electromagnetic radiation for potash for water vapor for normal
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  condensation trails to manipulate those to control the weather.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  So people don't go with the actual breakdown.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  What I'm telling you is it's what I'm agreeing with you is it's decided admitted science that
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  what is given in the Moderna Pfizer shots, but also through the virus vector shots of
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  AstraZeneca and J&J programs the body to mass produce yourselves a copy of this synthetic
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  nano protein.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  You are absolutely correct.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  I agree with you.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  Go ahead.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  I have the patent application, Alex.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  Well, just give it.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  Just give it.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  Just give it.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  Just give it.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  What do you want, the number or what, they took it off the web now so it's a trade secret.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  It's not a trade secret.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  It's not a trade secret.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  The Department of Energy runs the geoengineering.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  And you guys always, it's always like a cue thing.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  Like it can't be found.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  It makes it more fun.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  Guys, get me all the patents on the nano tech replicating spike proteins for this guy.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  It's like the FEMA camps are built.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  I have all the documents.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  People go, I heard there's a FEMA camp.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  I can't handle it anymore.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  I'm not mad at you, brother.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  I just can't handle it.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  I just can't handle it.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  The CIA is running a takeover of America.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  It's public Congress has it.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  They're having congressional hearings.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  Instead, people speculate about it.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  And then you tell me there's a patent I know about the self replicating nano tech in the
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  blood.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  I covered it two and a half years ago.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  And I'm glad you called in.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  I was agreeing with you.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  You started arguing with me about the spike protein, which is the same thing.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  What do you think prions are?
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  They're protein crystals that cause spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  I agree with you.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  I agree with you.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  I agree with you.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  I agree with you.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  I agree with you.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  I'm going to play the CIA director admitting they have chemtrails.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  Nobody wants to cover that or the admitted plan.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  Because if we actually went to Congress with that, we can stop them.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  It's always speculation and it's secret.

[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  By the way, I apologize the last caller if I got mad at them.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  They just kept debating me about it being nanotech, self-replicating protein, and I agree.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  But it turns out the synthetic spike protein created by BioWeb and Defense Labs late 1970s is that replicating protein.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  And so that's what they've hit us with.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  There's a bunch of other garbage in there as well.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  And I just get so mad talking about this and the mass death that's caused it.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  I wasn't mad at the caller. I'm just pissed off at it in general.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  Because 99% of the time we've got admitted documents where this stuff's going on, but nobody ever covers those.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  It's always just, I heard this or that.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  But what we do know is the shots don't work.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  They erase their immune system. They make us sick.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  They've killed a lot of people.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  And that should really upset you and it does upset me.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  But I do apologize for blowing up.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  I try to be calm here.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  But I get why a lot of the public just lives in La La Land because who wants to admit this is really all going down?
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  Let's talk to a caller in Missouri. Let's talk to Looney.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  Go ahead, sir. You're on the air or ma'am. Go ahead.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  Yes, sir. How are you doing, Brother Alex?
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  I'm all right, brother.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  You're doing pretty good.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Go ahead.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  Yeah, I'm a former DOD employee.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  I used to work for BAE, Northrop Grimman, Boston Dynamics, Boston Technologies.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  And brother, let me tell you what, once they unleash the hell that is behind all these systems, people are going to see just what we've been working on in secret.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  And everything done in the darkness will come to light.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  And I just want to want to thank you for everything that you've done and, you know, I want to thank you for giving me two beautiful little twin babies that are going to be born here in just a couple of weeks.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  I take your X2, take X3 bodies, and bio-true selenium.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  Brother, I'm telling you, the hellstorm is a common, and people need to get prepared mentally, spiritually, and physically.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  Well, let's walk through this piece by piece.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  For folks that don't know, it is selenium, and I'm not a scientist, I can read this scientific research.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  It's selenium and iodine deficiency that is causing most of the weird degenerative diseases and infertility and other problems.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  And as unhealthy as my lifestyle is and my stress I'm under, if I wasn't taking those, I couldn't do this.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  They literally, I feel more energy and more aggressive than when I was 20 years old because I take those things.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  Even though I was running six miles almost every day and lifting weights three days a week when I was 20, because of those things.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  And I guess that's what you're alluding to.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  I mean, are you tying?
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  I mean, what experience did you have once you took those?
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  Yes, sir. A little back history is 2017, I was actually paralyzed from my chest down due to a vaccine injury.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  And I don't want to get off into that, but I know it's from a vaccine injury.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  Like I said, I was paralyzed from my chest down.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I was told I wasn't going to be able to walk.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  Anyways, long story short, I'm taking the selenium, I'm taking the X3, X2.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  I'm a former Decaphalon runner. I was a high school Decaphalon runner, marathon runner.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  And I tell you what, if I had this back then, my life would be a different story.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  And like you said, you know, the selenium, once you combine that with the X2 or X3, I put it in my coffee.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  You know, you talk about getting fired up and the cognitive abilities that you get.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  You know, I used to not be able to dream until I started taking this just a few, two, three years ago.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  It really is incredible. It's involved in every cellular action in the body, all electrochemical activity, both selenium and iodine.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  That's why they're trying to keep those from us.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Now, separately, I know you can't get into classified stuff you signed on to,
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  but when you talk about some of the stuff that's been developed, I mean, just give us a prelude of where we've been right on air,
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  where we've been wrong from what you've seen without specifically telling us anything secret, but what you're concerned with.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  Yeah. Well, I've specialized in reconnaissance and satellite systems and swarm technology with the search and rescue robots and stuff like that,
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  you know, along with Atlas and some of the smaller drones that they have.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  Which they can flip a switch and weaponize it.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Yes, sir, absolutely. And, you know, with the, you got gates down there, releasing all them mosquitoes down there in Florida.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  And, you know, the thing is, I believe that they've already action, action planned this out and, you know, now we're in motion, you know,
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  and it may be too late to stop a lot of this, but if we can just get more people prepared,
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  like I said, spiritually and mentally and physically for what you're going to have to endure.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  And, you know, that's where we need to be at.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  And brother, I feel your frustration, you know, I try talking to people and they just look at me and they get this glazed look over their eyes.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  And, you know, and to me, that's just the demon inside of them.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  And the demons can't stand when you start talking, you know, good, good knowledge to them.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  They just can't stand it.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  And brother, you know, I love you. I love you, death.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  I've been listening to you my whole life.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  You know, prison planet, info wars.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  And I just pray for you. I love you.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  I thank you, sir.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  And I thank you and it's people like you, all the great listeners, Looney that keep me in the fight.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  And some days I'm not as good as I should be, but I'm trying as hard as I can.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  So just please pray for me.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  But God bless you.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  Yep, they've announced that California and Oregon combat robots weaponized on the streets to enforce future COVID lockdowns.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  It's all been announced.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  Got the stories right here.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  You snap your fingers.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  Combat robots are on the street.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  Told you that decades ago.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  All long term plan folks.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Pretty damn scary.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  And yeah, people don't know that in Brazil and in Florida and everywhere, they're releasing mosquitoes that sterilize all the other mosquitoes.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  With a quote, synthetic gene that blocks replication.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Joe in New Jersey.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  Joe, thanks.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  Welcome.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  So I used to work in the city at a media job.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  And recently I have ties with that media job because of the whole fake vaccine mandate and everything like that.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  I did a religious exemption the whole nine yards, but yeah, they didn't accept it.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  So I'm working a day job now and info wars really inspired me to use the talent that I gained and the skills that I gained at that media job and propel it into something else.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  So you inspired me to make my own podcast.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  I make videos in the same vein as info wars.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  And like really, I just want to say thank you for waking me up waking up my so I could wake up my family members and podcast is getting a little bit of traction now.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  And even Harrison Smith, who I listened to in the mornings, he told me about the Vinci Resolve.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  And that's a that's a program where you can make videos.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  So like, I just want to say this to info warriors to like, share the knowledge, get out there, like make your own show, make your own videos, make your own Instagram page,
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  make your own Twitter page, like absolutely.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  I mean, look, look, look, you really reach a few thousand people a month.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  That's giant when we're all doing it.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  You might reach a million.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  You never know.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Absolutely.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  But if you reach 10 people, that's beautiful.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  How do people find your podcast, Joe?
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  Oh, dude, it's only on Spotify.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  It's called connect those dots and you can go on my Instagram.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  It's underscore connect those dots underscore and you can find the podcast easier and there because it's kind of hard to find on Spotify.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  I'll connect those dots.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  And I recently I was just talking to the crew and the whole Albert Borla speech at the ADL, like it really like put me in a tizzy, put me in a whirlwind.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  And because he talks about misinformation.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  Everything he's doing, everything he's saying, I'm doing just I'm an age.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  Everything he says I'm doing is what he's doing.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  Exactly.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  So I made a video.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  I sent it to the crew.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  I don't know if they have it.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  Disco tips and it's it chronicles the timeline of all his lies when he initially said one shot will give you a total protection.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  And then I use like sort of the SpongeBob memes with if you moments later, if you weeks later.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  And then how long the video how long's the video we'll grab it and play it's only a minute long.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  Huh, hey, we'll come back and play it.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  Okay, God bless you, brother.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  That's that's that's great.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  And again, me blowing up the call earlier.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.280]  I just I hear about the spike proteins. I hear about the nano stuff, and it's it's 100% proven
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.200]  It just enrages me. They are literally murdering

[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:55.420]  voice of freedom

[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.540]  You know the Bible says let another mouth praise you I'm gonna do that right now
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:13.980]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry you guys have no idea
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:17.780]  How many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez?
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:23.900]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad the outer space because of Alex Jones including myself?
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:28.340]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:32.740]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:38.700]  I mean I've been able to be on podcast with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim cast the super Tim cast IRL
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:46.380]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and banned out video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:49.300]  We need to support free speech systems right now
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:54.780]  So go check out the store go support their store go support info wars leave a donation right now
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:56.780]  Don't wait until they're gone
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:01.300]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:08.100]  Stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:15.340]  Absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month Alex
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:24.140]  It's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after COVID-19. They illegally changed state elections
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:27.460]  mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:32.620]  Sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people. Well, this isn't any way to run an election
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:36.300]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:40.700]  And I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:47.420]  And I have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that that
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:51.940]  Question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:57.580]  Shouldn't be run the way they are. We're not election deniers. We're election realists
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:02.460]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:09.900]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:14.780]  The first amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely
[01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:19.500]  So they're gonna go from Mike Lindell next or they're gonna go for Steve Bannon or gonna go for Tucker Carlson
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.460]  I say the globalist 30 years ago
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:26.660]  But on their 28 years and I knew they were planning all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul revere
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:32.020]  But I couldn't have done it without your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:36.140]  Not as America were public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda
[01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:41.700]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been because of your past support
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:45.580]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now the critical juncture of the battle
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:50.980]  Three double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com getting amazing products that keep us on air
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:57.380]  1776 the promo code the destination is infowarstore.com. I thank you all for your support
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:05.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:07.300]  And
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.340]  We are backline broadcasting roll by
[01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:33.940]  The last caller called in about his podcast so we thought we'd check it out looks interesting
[01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:35.940]  And there's been a lot of these videos put out
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:38.340]  Which doesn't mean you shouldn't put out more
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:45.380]  Showing Fauci and Borla and Yates claiming the shots gonna work 100% Biden saying that and then overtime saying it doesn't work
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:49.460]  But you should be arrested if you don't want to take it or if you don't go along with it
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:52.780]  So here's from connect those dots podcast little video
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:48:00.460]  He did on Borla at the ADL two weeks ago saying I'm quote an agent of evil the most evil because I put out this info when he is an
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:02.300]  absolute lying
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:03.540]  eugenicist
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:05.700]  Joseph Mengele angel of death 2.0
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:09.780]  But are telling us that there is
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:15.540]  Protection against transmission with disease a few moments later
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:21.660]  There is no variant that we have identified that escapes the protection of our vaccines three days later
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:29.020]  Oh, we need to come now with a treatment of 90% effectiveness. You know personally makes me a lot of very proud one week later
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:34.780]  And we know that the three the two dogs of the vaccine offer very limited protection if any
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:38.460]  15 minutes later the three dogs is with a booster
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:44.740]  They offer reasonable protection the following Thursday. It is necessary a fourth boost
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:52.780]  All right now at the protection what you are getting from the third. It is good enough actually quite good for
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:56.780]  Hospitalizations and deaths is not that good against infections, but doesn't last
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:06.540]  Do you think that we will every fall have to prepare ourselves for a booster shot with COVID just like we get a flu shot
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:08.540]  I think so
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:13.500]  So excellent job connect the dots
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:18.100]  I hate to even plug listeners and fans great shows cuz a lot of times they get
[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:25.500]  Censored by the almighty control freaks, but there you go. If you call in you're asking for it. We're very proud of you
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:27.500]  Good job. Look
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.660]  Somebody should edit that in though. He'll talk about me being full of this information
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:33.380]  Now bad the evil Alex Jones is
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:38.940]  I'm getting serious here ladies and gentlemen. The
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:47.700]  Globalists have stolen the wealth. They think we're like a cockroach infestation eating their food
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:52.580]  They want to get rid of us and if we go on anything they say we're fools and I guess deserve what's happening
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.820]  But as I said a thousand times
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:00.860]  The children do not deserve what's happening to them and
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:04.860]  And so it's on us that we don't stand up against this God's watching
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:09.460]  Haiti in Michigan go ahead and thanks for calling
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:12.820]  Hello Alex glad
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:20.700]  Hey, I just want to thank you for all your products having a very good price and the highest quality of the on earth
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:23.140]  DNA force
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:25.780]  Changed my life. I'm on my fourth cycle
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:32.420]  With in the last few years every time I crack open a DNA force bottle. It's a new chapter in my life
[01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:34.420]  And it brings me closer to God
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:39.100]  Okay, so I wanted to mention the run-on silver and
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:41.780]  China is
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:44.340]  Planning with Russia to reevaluate gold and silver
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:47.540]  While the petro dollar is crashing and
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:53.420]  The protests in China is an excuse to shut down exports to the US
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:57.940]  And everybody listening should go out and buy silver
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:01.420]  Get in better physical and mental health
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:04.060]  learn more discipline
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:05.580]  fast
[01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:07.580]  That's going to be very important
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:09.580]  with the upcoming food shortages
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:16.780]  And also most importantly is to get closer to God and there's no need to be afraid when you're prepared
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:23.220]  Well, you're right one big reason gg ping is doing this is economic war and they can down to the factory down the neighborhood shut down
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:25.860]  What they don't want to go out of the country. That's a big part of it
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:33.100]  He's also testing his dictatorial powers his Italian powers over his population. We've really got to stand with the Chinese people
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:36.540]  Who are up against right now what we're going to be facing very very soon?
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:40.620]  Thank you, Alex
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:49.660]  Thank you, Alex Merry Christmas and Happy New Year's and I hope everybody goes into the New Year's told with peace and joy and
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:56.500]  Like I said when you're prepared, there's no need to be afraid to get your storeable food at least at least six months
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:59.580]  Absolutely. God bless you. I'm gonna go back to more calls. Let me just throw this out there
[01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:03.260]  We're barely treading water. We're barely in the black right now
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:05.940]  We need to sell products to have money to keep you stay on there
[01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:11.700]  We're under massive attack. Everybody sees that you hear these billion dollar judgments and all that we're gonna appeal that for years
[01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:15.620]  That doesn't matter as long as we have the legal fees to keep battling it will be on air for years
[01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:21.220]  Building that the issue is people here. Oh billion dollar judgment. He must be going off here. No reason to support him
[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:23.420]  It's their desperation
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:28.020]  We're actually stronger than ever a lot of stuff's happened behind the scenes. I'm not liberty to tell you about
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:33.460]  but I've had top people reach out and some of them in person
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:37.620]  And you know household names and just say
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:45.580]  Everybody they talk to brings up the show and that the show is leading the fight against the new world order and that massive numbers of Congress
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:51.020]  They're now awakened listening and the world leaders are awakened listening and I already knew this but it's intense now
[01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:54.860]  So they're attempts to shut us down only got more people tuned in
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:53:00.380]  More informed people to get tuned in and so folks are really waking up to what's happening very very quick
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:04.820]  so we've always reached out to the general public and we've been very successful waking the public up but our
[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:11.540]  Real effect is now happening in the intelligentsia and so keeping us on air every day. We're on air as a big victory
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:12.820]  It's all in God's hands

[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:50.260]  First time speaking to you Alex, and I'm glad I am mad
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:55.060]  That we all know Alex Jones was right. We need hashtag Alex Jones is right
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:57.620]  We have to stay ahead stop being late in the game
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:01.900]  I don't know if it's the brain force my natural manhood from what you've taught me
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:06.700]  But I'm so mad and the reason I call is we're all mad and we have to get ahead of this
[01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:13.180]  Like you said, it's not a big deal. It's a huge deal and what we're seeing in China will be here physically
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:15.220]  It's already here mentally if you think about it
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:20.980]  It's never going to end the CIA saying my freedom is fake Arizona falsely certifying it today and
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:27.500]  Oh my gosh Alex Elon shirts. He found that Twitter, you know the 7,500 employees
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:33.940]  That's why they need 7,500 employees to promote this horrible communism and think about everyone everyone out there
[01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:38.020]  Think about every corporation that's their army and we just figured out the secret
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:43.020]  So I am doing something the people must take action now since they kicked Trump out
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:46.580]  It's our turn and I'm literally suing the United States of America
[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:52.900]  The United States of America Inc or anyone using and having in their name or doing business as the United States of America

[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:36.780]  Why is Xi Jinping doing this?

[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:13.100]  So I work for a company based in Fort Worth Texas that makes triggers for AR-15s and AK
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:17.100]  I just wanted to let you know that we love you and we support you man
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:23.100]  I want to promote two of your products, vitamin mineral fusion
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:28.100]  I had to start taking vitamins because I got really tired during the day
[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:34.100]  And I started taking vitamin mineral fusion and I'm not getting tired anymore
[02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:42.100]  Also I take your X2 iodine and my acne on my face cleared up really good so I'm guessing it's good for your skin
[02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:47.100]  Well it deals with all electrochemical activity that's why I'm so bummed around an X2 and an X3
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:51.100]  And it's going to be next year till we get more in and that's our best seller
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:56.100]  I warned people on this stuff selling out and that's what Dr. Group told me ten years ago
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:02:00.100]  He goes you've got a few sunspots on your face because I'm an outdoors guy
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:04.100]  He told me a bunch of other stuff that would happen and I'm like he goes just take it for two weeks and see what happens
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:08.100]  He said like libido and I said I don't have a problem with that department and he goes yeah
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:12.100]  He said you'll be like you're 16 again and sure enough about two or three weeks later
[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:19.100]  Man the energy, the other areas and then in a couple months I had sunspots
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.100]  They just went away just like you said
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:24.100]  It's great my acne is a lot better now
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:25.100]  Beautiful
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:34.100]  Also I mean I found out the hard way that you need to stock up on the iodine because like you said it goes out of stock and you don't get it for a while
[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:42.100]  So I try to buy a couple more than usual so I can have some for when you're out of stock
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:49.100]  Well we're gonna try to fix that you know we've been that's the problem with tread and water is I mean I don't want to get into it all but
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:55.100]  A lot of good stuff's happening we've been blessing a lot of ways and it looks like things are coming through in the next few weeks
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:03:01.100]  On a lot of fronts and hopefully you know we'll be in a position to keep going here but it's all in God's hands
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:03.100]  Right I'm glad God's taking care of you
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:11.100]  I wanted to talk about the vaccines right quick I wanted to ask your opinion on how long the media is going to be able to keep up this charade
[02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:13.100]  Of pretending like nothing is happening
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:21.100]  I mean as long as they can censor as they think they can but I mean the British Medical Journal came out two three weeks ago and said this is the biggest medical scandal in history
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:29.100]  It doesn't protect you people are dying in mass it's producing self replicating proteins in the body prions
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:36.100]  And I mean it's it's it's it's it's it but I mean even I can't believe it during the break earlier I was just like I was almost
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:43.100]  Couldn't even continue the show I mean I get why people can't believe this because your government's worse than Adolf Hitler
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:47.100]  Big Pharma is doing on a wider scale than Adolf Hitler
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:50.100]  Joseph Mengele when you look at Fauci how evil he is
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:58.100]  I mean he literally is murdering tens of millions of people he wants to he's injecting kids they know what they're doing God they're evil
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:09.100]  It's just it's I know you're right about people waking up because I go on Twitter and all you have to do is go into the hashtags of vaccines and every post you see is anti-vax COVID vax
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:15.100]  And tells you that people having mito caritis because the vaccine having heart issues
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:20.100]  I got I was in Florida for a week and everywhere I went I got mobbed
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:23.100]  I was in western Florida I was in southern Sarasota
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:28.100]  Siesta key and I got mobbed everywhere not one negative comment not one nothing
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:42.100]  Grocery store the beach everywhere and my five-year-old daughter goes daddy who are you why do they all love you so much and they something love me they love the truth so the enemies program has backfired the problem is
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:49.100]  Jaden they're gonna want something else now they never give up so we can all be excited but we better be watching our six thank you so much
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:55.100]  We're gonna go to break come out with Dan Dix investigative journalists you don't want to miss this information stay with us and more calls as well
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:10.100]  Until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors
[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:15.100]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather
[02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:23.100]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3
[02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:29.100]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3
[02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:38.100]  But if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things you start replicating and taking your body over
[02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:52.100]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body for 50% off at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776

[02:06:53.100 --> 02:07:02.100]  This is Dan Dix here reporting for press for truth coming at you today with what may be the most important video I'll have produced in 2022
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:10.100]  I got a lot of questions that need to be answered this video needs to go viral so we can all get to the bottom of this so let's jump right into it
[02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:18.100]  Balenciaga is a high-end luxury and fashion brand that sells ridiculously expensive items and clothing
[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:26.100]  Their holiday gifting campaign is trying to sell you something but it's not clothing it's sex with children
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:35.100]  Why is this child posing with teddy bears wearing sexual bondage gear with a white rabbit and a stack of duct tape and a dog leash?
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:40.100]  Why is this kid posing with the white rabbit, a bondage bear and more duct tape?
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:50.100]  Or why is this toddler holding a teddy bear dressed in sexual bondage gear complete with a leather harness with yet another white rabbit and dog leash?
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:55.100]  Why is this young child being depicted with a sexualized teddy bear?
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:08:10.100]  Why is that same toddler shown here lying face down with these bondage bears on the couch and dresser, candles and beer cans, wine glasses, another dog leash and some sort of dog collar bowl on the floor?
[02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:18.100]  Why did they create a fashion show with a bunch of troubled individuals carrying around these sex bondage petal bears?
[02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:31.100]  Why did this company post a photo with a book in the background by Michael Borumies, the man who also wrote Fire from the Sun, a book that features naked children with pedophiles as its artwork?
[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:41.100]  Why did they post a photo of this bag with pages open showing a section of a Supreme Court ruling against a law that was designed to fight pedophilia?
[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:58.100]  The court documents concerning Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, a 2002 Supreme Court case that struck down a portion of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, ruling that virtual child pornography is protected speech.
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:05.100]  Why is this major retail brand promoting child pornography and they're not being subtle about it?
[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:09.100]  They're very brazen about it, putting it out in the open for all to see.
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:14.100]  Why are they trying to sell the idea that they are okay with pedophilia?
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:22.100]  I mean, just think of the amount of people involved here, the producers, the photographer, the parents, the creative directors.
[02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:28.100]  Why didn't anyone at some point along the line say, hold up, what the effort we all doing here?
[02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:36.100]  The reason is because of a movement that is trying to normalize pedophilia while also sexualizing young children.
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:44.100]  They use terms like maps, which stands for minor attracted persons, as if to just say, it's just a sexual preference.
[02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:53.100]  They launched NAMBLA, which stands for North American Man-Boy Love Association, a pedophile advocacy group that's run out of the United States.
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:10:01.100]  They promote drag shows for kids, and if you say anything negative about that, you're just a transphobic bigot.
[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:08.100]  The schools are pushing all of this as well, because if they are saying that a child can change their sex,
[02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:12.100]  they'll eventually be saying that that means a child can consent to it as well.
[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:18.100]  Even the big banks are promoting, utilizing, castrating and sterilizing young children.
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:24.100]  Canadian Bank donates $500,000 for transgender surgeries on kids.
[02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:34.100]  A top Canadian bank just donated a half a million dollars to a hospital program in Ontario that specializes in transgender surgeries for children.
[02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:40.100]  And here it is for TD Banks.
[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:46.100]  For a closer look at the Lanciaga scandal, this is one of the other big brands as well.
[02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:54.100]  It's investigative journalist Dan Dix who I've known for more than 15 years, PressForTruth.ca. I want to talk about this, but also the China situation,
[02:10:54.100 --> 02:11:01.100]  the new lockdowns they're preparing, the man that says he loves authoritarian dictatorships that runs Canada and more.
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.100]  Dan Dix joins us.
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:06.100]  Dan, you shot that video days ago.
[02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:07.100]  It's since gone viral.
[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:11.100]  A lot has happened with this big company since then.
[02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:19.100]  And so let's recap what's happened and then a lot of the other catalogs have been found to have the very same stuff, including things I won't show on air.
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:25.100]  The rape and murder of children simulated, children being hunted through the woods by Satanists and murdered.
[02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:28.100]  I mean, this is just really, really nasty people.
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:31.100]  So thanks for helping us get to the bottom of it.
[02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:40.100]  Well, Alex, they've already been exposed that they are doing this and they have taken the position that this is just some sort of ridiculous conspiracy.
[02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:41.100]  This is nonsense.
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:48.100]  Well, if that's the case, why are they now suing the ad campaign company who put together this set?
[02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:52.100]  You know, that's almost as admit that something indeed very wrong did go on here.
[02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:57.100]  And as I mentioned in that video, you got to ask the question about how many people are involved in this.
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:11:59.100]  You got the parents, the directors, the producers.
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:02.100]  As I said, this is clearly a massive movement.
[02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:08.100]  But I think one of the big takeaways from that video, Alex, is that I got the sense that they saw that this was coming.
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:15.100]  You said this was a big video and it was because two days ago, I had my YouTube channel terminated over this.
[02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:17.100]  275,000 subscribers.
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:18.100]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:21.100]  So, so, so, oh, for exposing the pedophilia, they admit this happened.
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:24.100]  The head photographer says he was told to show those images they've been caught.
[02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:30.100]  And for you, exposing Jeffrey Epstein 2.0, YouTube is protecting pedophiles at an industrial level.
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:31.100]  Wow, what a scandal.
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:35.100]  Well, it's even crazier than that, Alex, because this actually happened before.
[02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:39.100]  Back in 2020, I put out a video about the Wayfair conspiracy.
[02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:46.100]  Now, I was showing that to be a red herring saying that they are doing this on purpose so that in the future, when something does happen,
[02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:50.100]  they can point to this and just say, oh, that's a debunked, you know, conspiracy.
[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:53.100]  And then within hours, my channel was terminated back in 2020.
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:57.100]  Seven months later, they contacted me and said, we've been to the stake.
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:58.100]  We apologize.
[02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:00.100]  We've reinstated your channel.
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:02.100]  We're going to look into what happened here.
[02:13:02.100 --> 02:13:03.100]  So that was kind of bizarre.
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:06.100]  Fast forward a couple of years, and now the Balenciaga thing happens.
[02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:10.100]  And in that video, I briefly mentioned the Wayfair conspiracy video.
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:17.100]  And I see, remember, two years ago, I said that they are going to set up a red herring so that in the future, they can just dismiss this as nonsense.
[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:18.100]  They did that with PizzaGate.
[02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:21.100]  I remember them suspending you then.
[02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:22.100]  But I'm sorry.
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:24.100]  The big news is this is admitted.
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:26.100]  The company admits it's pedophilic.
[02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:27.100]  They apologize.
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:29.100]  And now you've been banned off YouTube.
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:34.100]  Google has now directly endorsed pedophilia, promotion of pedophilia.
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:35.100]  This is now the big story.
[02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:36.100]  So let's start over.
[02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:40.100]  You'll have the whole hour that's left to walk through this, but the three minutes to break.
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:41.100]  Start over.
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:43.100]  Dan Dix, press for truth.
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:44.100]  I wanted you on days ago.
[02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:45.100]  Didn't know this had just happened.
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:51.100]  You've now been banned on YouTube by Google for exposing an admitted promotion of pedophilia.
[02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:53.100]  Recap that.
[02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:55.100]  Exactly that, Alex.
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:57.100]  Because of that video, I was banned.
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:14:03.100]  And the day that I was banned, I was actually out at one of these drag queen for little three
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:08.100]  year olds to cover this, to continue on this expose.
[02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:14.100]  And believe it or not, there were counter protesters at this thing, which just goes to show you
[02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:21.100]  how big this movement really is becoming and the fact that there are powerful, influential,
[02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:29.100]  famous billionaires, politicians, high levels of finance men here, military men, all are
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:31.100]  involved with this at the highest levels.
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:36.100]  And when we see companies as big as Balenciaga getting exposed for this, just imagine what
[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:38.100]  else is going on out there, Alex.
[02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:40.100]  This is really just maybe the tip of the iceberg.
[02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:43.100]  This is the beginning of the fall of this pedophile network.
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:50.100]  I would really hope to believe that that is the case, that this movement has a counter
[02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:51.100]  movement.
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:52.100]  And I mean, you can see it.
[02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:54.100]  I mean, most people are on the side of the children.
[02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:55.100]  Right?
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:58.100]  These protesters were chanting, trans rights are human rights.
[02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:01.100]  And it's like, yeah, that's not the issue.
[02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:03.100]  We're here to protect the children.
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:06.100]  And that's what this whole Balenciaga expose is all about.
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:10.100]  I mean, you look at the intro of that video that I put together.
[02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:15.100]  What about dressing up kids in makeup looking like they've been beaten up carrying around
[02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:16.100]  these paedo bears?
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:17.100]  That's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:18.100]  You did that.
[02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:23.100]  Well, who doesn't know panda eyes is a big pedophile thing for after a small child's
[02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:25.100]  been brutally raped, it blacks their eyes.
[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:29.100]  Yeah, you know, there's one big one that I even missed in my video in the photo.
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:33.100]  I don't know if you could pull it up, but there's the one photo of the girl lying face
[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:35.100]  down on the couch and there's all that terrible stuff.
[02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:41.100]  Well, right beside her is a big, huge dog bed and it's actually a heart within a heart
[02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:46.100]  and WikiLeaks has exposed the FBI document that said that a heart within the heart is
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:48.100]  a secret paedo symbol for a little girl lover.
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:54.100]  So it's it's right there playing his day for anyone to see and stay there.
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:58.100]  Dan, this is incredible.
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:02.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:03.100]  through Christmas.
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:10.100]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered, not just up to 60% off
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:17.100]  with promo code 1776, but on top of it, double patriot points and what makes this the most
[02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:19.100]  special sale ever.
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:24.100]  Every order will get a free gift, no matter how small or how big and it's all randomly
[02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:27.100]  selected by the shopping cart computer.
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:30.100]  So you might order a sticker pack for five dollars.
[02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:36.100]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for four ninety five and then get something worth
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:38.100]  fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty hundred dollars.
[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:43.100]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs, some of them are Alex Jones Halloween masks,
[02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:47.100]  some of them are books, films, um, Info Wars flags, American flags.
[02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:49.100]  There are hundreds of different items.
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:50.100]  It's all random.
[02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:54.100]  InfoWarsStore.com, every order gets a free gift.
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:59.100]  Free gifts for every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:04.100]  I have been in a twenty eight year marathon battle with the globalist.
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:10.100]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:11.100]  world.
[02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:16.100]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:17.100]  deserve the credit.
[02:17:17.100 --> 02:17:22.100]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:24.100]  reason you have the success.
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:29.100]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever
[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:30.100]  had.
[02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:34.100]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:38.100]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been
[02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:43.100]  in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:44.100]  God bless you all.
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:45.100]  I salute you.
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:46.100]  I thank you.
[02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:51.100]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:52.100]  thing is happening.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:54.100]  The fight is my fight.
[02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:55.100]  It's your fight.
[02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:56.100]  It's our fight.
[02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:57.100]  God bless you all.
[02:17:57.100 --> 02:18:03.220]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:08.180]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:13.820]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:19.620]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:25.500]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive law
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:31.260]  fair being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:36.500]  InfoWars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:40.980]  lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:46.860]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian
[02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:47.860]  oppression.
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:48.860]  So continue to do it.
[02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:53.580]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com, go to the places like Save InfoWars, continue
[02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:58.580]  to keep InfoWars alive because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[02:18:58.580 --> 02:19:01.300]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:02.540]  Why is this taking so long?
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:06.060]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:07.340]  Why can't we do this here?
[02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:09.860]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:14.140]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:15.980]  or Governor DeSaint Timonius.
[02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:19.820]  They're going to deny us Michigan, they're going to deny us Pennsylvania, they're going
[02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:26.580]  to deny us Arizona and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:32.140]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:36.220]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[02:19:36.220 --> 02:19:39.900]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:41.740]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:45.380]  That's why InfoWars.com is so damn important.
[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:48.780]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:50.900]  You don't need to get behind InfoWars.
[02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:56.100]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[02:19:56.100 --> 02:19:59.700]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[02:19:59.700 --> 02:20:12.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:17.340]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, this Monday edition, November 28, 2022.
[02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:20.380]  And a lot of listeners who've been listening for decades, they say, yeah, Jones really
[02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:25.100]  has hammered the whole elite pedophile connection and now it's all true.
[02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:26.100]  It's like he predicted it.
[02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:29.020]  I didn't predict anything.
[02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:37.060]  It was major scandals in the 80s and 90s and 2000s in Belgium, in France, in the Netherlands,
[02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:45.300]  in the UK, in Canada and in the US, as well as other places where it wasn't just aristocrats,
[02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:50.860]  the ultra-rich, starting with judges right up to presidents, prime ministers and billionaires,
[02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:54.860]  raping little children, was also killing them.
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:21:00.660]  So the star of the next segment, I'm going to play a clip from an admitted survivor in
[02:21:00.660 --> 02:21:03.820]  Belgium where they found these little girls that were alive, the others had all spent
[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:09.620]  starved to death in cages, others had been chopped up, and she survived one of the few
[02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:15.340]  found in a cage, run by the local police chief and others.
[02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:19.500]  So this is very, very real, folks.
[02:21:19.500 --> 02:21:20.500]  These aren't speculation.
[02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:25.980]  So when you hear this hellraiser stuff from me, and Jones has got a sick mind, no, Jeffrey
[02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:29.300]  Dahmer is like a one on a Richter scale compared to these people.
[02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:30.300]  They're a 20.
[02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:34.060]  And yes, I know the Richter scale only goes to 10.
[02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:37.060]  It's like spinal tap, but it goes to 11.
[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:41.020]  And you've got to understand that because we won't admit this exists historically,
[02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:42.740]  it keeps winning.
[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:45.540]  So Dan Dix dropped a mom's show on us.
[02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:51.620]  I saw his report on infowars.com, like on Friday, I thought he did the best job.
[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:53.260]  We posted it on Saturday.
[02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:57.780]  I told the crew on Saturday, get Dan Dix, he's here today, hadn't followed his work
[02:21:57.780 --> 02:22:03.500]  since then, banned on YouTube for the report you just saw us air 10 minutes ago, which
[02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:05.100]  is all admitted fat.
[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:06.540]  They admit it's pedo.
[02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:09.540]  They say they're sorry, and he's banned.
[02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:10.540]  Unbelievable.
[02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:15.740]  He's banned for exposing these people and remember that they're protecting them.
[02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:17.900]  So that makes them accomplices.
[02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:19.620]  So Dan, please continue.
[02:22:19.620 --> 02:22:22.140]  Well, yeah, that's it.
[02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:24.660]  I've been banned for this.
[02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:29.780]  And you've kind of obviously were the first domino to fall when it comes to, you know,
[02:22:29.780 --> 02:22:30.780]  being banned.
[02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:33.060]  And then it's trickled down to everyone else.
[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:37.140]  And I mean, there's a clip floating around right now of you and I over a decade ago doing
[02:22:37.140 --> 02:22:40.340]  an interview talking about the future of the internet.
[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:44.540]  And in that particular video, you basically nailed it.
[02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:49.860]  What was coming down the pike in terms of them shutting us down, popping up with little
[02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:54.180]  fact check messages saying that, oh, you better go to this website to see what the real truth
[02:22:54.180 --> 02:22:55.180]  is.
[02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:59.900]  You predicted all of that back this over a decade ago, and that once they tried to ban
[02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:04.020]  us and they tried to shut us down, that there would be a fork in the road and we'd eventually
[02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:09.300]  move into more decentralized platforms and there'd be more censorship resistant and
[02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:12.260]  freedom minded platforms that would come up.
[02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:16.980]  And all of a sudden, sure enough, we have the, you know, the audicis and the bidshoots
[02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:21.020]  and the mines and the rumbles and all these types of things exactly as you predicted.
[02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:25.740]  So I'm really not surprised that I have been banned over this.
[02:23:25.740 --> 02:23:27.020]  It's really coming as no surprise.
[02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:28.740]  I kind of take it with a badge of honor.
[02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:30.340]  I was about to say badge of honor.
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:33.100]  I mean, this is a badge of shame for Google.
[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:39.700]  I mean, there should be a congressional investigation over them banning you over that report documenting
[02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:43.580]  in a very conservative way, an admitted pedophilic promotion.
[02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:44.580]  Yeah.
[02:23:44.580 --> 02:23:50.180]  I mean, and I'm not the only one, there's other more famous people who have done this
[02:23:50.180 --> 02:23:52.460]  and they're not being taken down from YouTube.
[02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:53.700]  Maybe their time is yet to come.
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:54.700]  I don't know.
[02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:58.900]  Um, but it seems that, uh, I've certainly been targeted over this particular campaign
[02:23:58.900 --> 02:24:01.700]  and you got to ask the question, why is that right?
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:02.700]  Why on earth would they pretend?
[02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:06.140]  Well, it's because you've been on this for a long time and, and you're very effective
[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:10.020]  and you're very conservative and so you do a very professional job like pizza game.
[02:24:10.020 --> 02:24:11.020]  We had it in the wiki leaks.
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:12.020]  It's all real.
[02:24:12.020 --> 02:24:16.060]  They focus on a pizza place and we didn't, we barely got sucked into it.
[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:20.180]  They misrepresented that we totally created the theory, which they then use in this credit
[02:24:20.180 --> 02:24:22.060]  the rest of it.
[02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:25.780]  Another great example of one of these red herrings where they know that this information
[02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:27.220]  is going to come out one day.
[02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:32.620]  So they put out this nonsense conspiracy that's easily debunked so that when the real
[02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:36.260]  truth comes out, people can just point to this and say, oh, that's just piece of gate
[02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:39.380]  nonsense or, oh, that's just way fair conspiracy nonsense.
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:41.540]  And now they say balance, Jaeger.
[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:45.580]  That's probably just the same kind of pizza gate or way fair and all that stuff that's
[02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:46.980]  already being debunked.
[02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:50.420]  It's all done by design because they know that we're onto it.
[02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:52.260]  They know that we've been exposing this.
[02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:57.460]  And so the fact that they have to use these almost psychological operations and propaganda
[02:24:57.460 --> 02:25:04.420]  to discredit what we are saying, again, vindicates us even more so as we continue to expose this
[02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:05.420]  stuff.
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:06.420]  And there's no end to it.
[02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:10.980]  I mean, look what just happened with Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein, the whole house of cards.
[02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:12.700]  Well, that's where I was going next.
[02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:17.260]  I was told by high-level Hollywood people and others, not just about the British pedophilia
[02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:21.820]  that was all admitted and Jimmy Savelle and Prince Charles, long before it came out with
[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:25.060]  Prince Charles' brother, Prince Andrew.
[02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:28.660]  And it was specifically the Epstein stuff is why they came after me.
[02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:33.540]  They used other reasons and they used Sandy Hook later, but it was specifically exposing
[02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:36.940]  the Pito rings as what made them come after me.
[02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:39.380]  I'm not surprised about that at all, Alex.
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:45.260]  You know, that doesn't surprise me whatsoever because you too have been at the top of exposing
[02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:46.260]  this stuff.
[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:50.740]  So maybe for a little while, they were just ignoring you thinking that, oh, I mean, what
[02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:51.740]  harm could it really cause?
[02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:57.180]  And I think you got to the point where they're like, oh, he's actually changing the world.
[02:25:57.180 --> 02:26:00.900]  We need to put a stop to this, which is why they come down so hard on you.
[02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:01.900]  Sure.
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:04.500]  The reason I raise it is you get banned, I get banned.
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:09.740]  You expose the exploitation, the torture, the rape, even murder of children.
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:11.580]  That's their special thing.
[02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:12.780]  That's their heart and soul.
[02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:14.980]  That's what they will not tolerate.
[02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:17.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:21.180]  But I'm not going to tolerate being shut down.
[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:25.500]  I'm certainly not going to let a little thing like being banned from YouTube stop me.
[02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:29.300]  This is actually just giving more fire under my belly to want to continue to expose these
[02:26:29.300 --> 02:26:30.820]  guys for what they are.
[02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:34.460]  This is making me want to just build up my other platforms.
[02:26:34.460 --> 02:26:38.820]  People can help me do that by going at PressForTruth.ca, but there's all the other platforms
[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:40.100]  where I'm posting on.
[02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:45.900]  And that's really key moving forward is that we focus on these decentralized platforms
[02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:50.700]  so that when we do put out this information, it's not just going to be zapped.
[02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:51.940]  No, I totally agree.
[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:58.580]  We use the old enemy platforms to take people to the new independent platforms like the
[02:26:58.580 --> 02:27:02.220]  getters and like the rumbles and the gabs and so many others.
[02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:05.860]  But we're going to go to break here in a few minutes, but let's talk about this.
[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:08.060]  They are losing control.
[02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:11.380]  We take this big apparel company, they had to back off and say they're sorry.
[02:27:11.380 --> 02:27:17.460]  But then their agents, their fellow travelers, though, then try to suppress what's happening.
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:18.460]  That shows how weak they are.
[02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:23.500]  We should call and go on the offense and call for a congressional investigation and a parliamentary
[02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:29.460]  investigation in Canada of Google censoring the press to protect pedophiles.
[02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:33.780]  I mean, I think Google's got some answers that they've got to answer to.
[02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:39.380]  Well, yeah, and it's not just pedophiles that I'm exposing here in Canada.
[02:27:39.380 --> 02:27:45.460]  I'm exposing the tyrant Justin Trudeau and the fact that if you want to tie it all in,
[02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:50.740]  he's appearing on drag queen shows, promoting so-called diversity.
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:55.620]  So when I go after that stuff as well, he brings his children to the Pride Parade.
[02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:59.740]  Little kids, I confronted him on that face to face about bringing his little five-year-old
[02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:01.140]  to the Gay Pride Parade.
[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:06.140]  So anybody that's ever documented a Gay Pride Parade, I mean, they run from wild to out
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:10.220]  of control, people eating poop, men having sex, peeing on each other.
[02:28:10.220 --> 02:28:13.460]  I mean, folks, it is unbelievable.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:18.660]  We should see this drag queen story time for little three-year-old toddlers that just happened
[02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:21.980]  in Kitslano, Vancouver a couple of days ago that I went to.
[02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:29.500]  Literally gay men in G-strings prancing around and performing in front of toddlers with counter-protestors
[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:34.100]  outside upset about the fact that we're there saying that something about this is wrong.
[02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:35.100]  You know, this isn't right.
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:37.700]  We shouldn't be sexualizing young children.
[02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:40.500]  And yet there's police outside protecting the children.
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:42.500]  Oh, it's the LGBTP.
[02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:46.380]  And again, I don't care if it's a heterosexual or homosexual events, keep your hands away
[02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:47.380]  from the children.
[02:28:47.380 --> 02:28:50.940]  These people are degenerates and their final frontier is our children.
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:51.940]  That's a fact.
[02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:57.940]  We'll be right back with Dan Dix.
[02:28:57.940 --> 02:28:59.940]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[02:28:59.940 --> 02:29:02.620]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:08.660]  Now, the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[02:29:08.660 --> 02:29:13.180]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:15.260]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:19.140]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWare and get the biggest sales of
[02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:20.140]  the year.
[02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:27.020]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and Bio Trusillinium and our Wake Up America award-winning
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:28.020]  coffee.
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:33.340]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so many other
[02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:39.140]  great products like Ultimate Crill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaso Beats, Secret 12, they are
[02:29:39.140 --> 02:29:43.180]  all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:45.780]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[02:29:45.780 --> 02:29:51.780]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at infowarstore.com, ChromoCode 1776
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:56.220]  and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at infowarstore.com.
[02:29:56.220 --> 02:30:00.220]  Thank you so much for your support and God bless.
[02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:05.700]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:12.580]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where
[02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:18.140]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:27.300]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:35.580]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID,
[02:30:35.580 --> 02:30:41.220]  post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:43.020]  care.
[02:30:43.020 --> 02:30:49.980]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health
[02:30:49.980 --> 02:30:51.260]  advice.

[02:31:00.460 --> 02:31:05.420]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has
[02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:11.460]  truly earned the title of top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged
[02:31:11.460 --> 02:31:12.460]  the globalist.
[02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:18.100]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years and that's
[02:31:18.100 --> 02:31:23.020]  because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:29.900]  Now Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:32.220]  Introducing top G supplements.
[02:31:32.220 --> 02:31:36.700]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and
[02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:37.700]  his crew.
[02:31:37.700 --> 02:31:42.060]  We have the chance to benefit in body, mind and soul with the same supplements that Andrew
[02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:43.620]  Tate takes himself.

[02:31:54.940 --> 02:31:55.940]  Men grow up to be like me.
[02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:59.060]  You're going to have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record, dedicated athletes,
[02:31:59.060 --> 02:32:02.860]  who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:08.220]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[02:32:08.220 --> 02:32:10.260]  a healthier life.
[02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:14.100]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:15.740]  that contains both.
[02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:20.700]  This infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[02:32:20.700 --> 02:32:22.300]  from the infowars store.
[02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:27.140]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[02:32:27.140 --> 02:32:29.820]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:34.660]  Federal chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:39.380]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:40.380]  shown.
[02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:44.660]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:49.260]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:54.380]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:55.380]  like here in America.
[02:32:55.380 --> 02:33:00.780]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at InfowarsStore.com leading a frontal
[02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:04.500]  assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:19.180]  It's Alex Jones crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:19.180 --> 02:33:27.740]  This is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:32.260]  So the global social engineers count on us having short attention spans.
[02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:36.420]  They admit they've shortened the ads, they've sped things up for children, been going on
[02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:43.460]  for 70 years to really get people where they're easily distracted and also easily suggestible.
[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:47.820]  But I've always I guess had this gift or a curse you could call it up until about five
[02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:52.780]  six years ago, my memory was near photographic as you get older and I guess drink a little
[02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:53.780]  too much.
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:54.780]  It's not as photographic as used to be.
[02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:55.780]  It's almost a blessing.
[02:33:55.780 --> 02:33:59.060]  It's used to I'd see a story and remember like 10,000 connected ones, it would just
[02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:01.260]  be like brain sped up that fast.
[02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:04.460]  People used to remember I could like word for word, quote stories for five years before
[02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:06.460]  whole paragraphs and we're like how the hell did you do that?
[02:34:06.460 --> 02:34:07.460]  You gotta have a teleprompter.
[02:34:07.460 --> 02:34:12.060]  No, I had photographic memory and it's almost a blessing that it's I don't have one now.
[02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:16.460]  I'll be like my dad, but I'm 70 something and I'll be kind of like, Hey, everything's
[02:34:16.460 --> 02:34:18.580]  great, I'll remember anything.
[02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:27.020]  But I remember being on air and I remember doing research in the 90s and just back then
[02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:28.900]  they didn't completely control the corporate press.
[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:34.980]  So it'd be like the Times of London describing a story in Burgundy, France, where they found
[02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:39.580]  a young teenage girl who weighed like 80 something pounds of concentration camp victim, cuts
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:41.140]  all over.
[02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:42.420]  She runs into a local town.
[02:34:42.420 --> 02:34:44.380]  They won't help her local state or the state police.
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:45.740]  They go to a Rothschild castle.
[02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:46.740]  It was a Rothschild estate.
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:48.460]  A lot of these states are.
[02:34:48.460 --> 02:34:50.460]  Most of the castles in France are actually home of the Rothschilds.
[02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:51.460]  Look it up.
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:56.580]  It was a big wine growing estate and they go in and there's a dungeon with all these dead
[02:34:56.580 --> 02:35:00.660]  women and dead girls in some of them are stuffed.
[02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:02.820]  Some of them are in gelatin solution.
[02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:06.460]  Others have been put in acid baths and a few were alive in cages.
[02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:10.380]  I remember that was about 1998.
[02:35:10.380 --> 02:35:12.460]  I covered that anybody.
[02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:17.420]  Many journalists watching the New York Times can look up Sunday Times of London and that
[02:35:17.420 --> 02:35:18.420]  article.
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:21.780]  The point is, is that I've seen documentaries on this stuff.
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:26.060]  Jimmy Savelle and his torture dungeon where he raped little kids and where he'd kill them
[02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:27.500]  while he raped them.
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:28.820]  That all came out in court.
[02:35:28.820 --> 02:35:30.020]  So this is all out there.
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:36.580]  But this story, testimony of Anika Lucas, survivor of the Belgian pedophile network.
[02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:41.020]  Children were mainly used for sex, but there were a number of aristocrats, royalty you
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:46.820]  name it, who were part of the club who enjoyed killing children, beating them, cutting them,
[02:35:46.820 --> 02:35:50.300]  then chasing them through the woods with dogs, hunting them and killing them.
[02:35:50.300 --> 02:35:53.460]  Other times they would just have children in cages begging for mommy and they would
[02:35:53.460 --> 02:35:57.220]  just go sit while they begged for mommy and have their dinners while children begged and
[02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:58.220]  pleaded in cages.
[02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:03.660]  I mean, and they called it the beautiful music they make, the children of the night.
[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:06.980]  So you have to understand that I didn't come up with this stuff.
[02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:07.980]  People say, Jones?
[02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:12.420]  Well, Terry Shurer said, I've heard Jones's show, he would be the greatest Hollywood screen
[02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:13.420]  writer ever.
[02:36:13.420 --> 02:36:15.540]  The stuff he comes up with, I didn't come up with any of this.
[02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:17.540]  This is what they do.
[02:36:17.540 --> 02:36:18.540]  This is the reality.
[02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:20.380]  Who can come up with any of this stuff?
[02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:23.820]  They're putting deadly injections in us that grow prions in us.
[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:26.620]  I mean, these are psychotic people.
[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:30.940]  So I wanted to go back to Dan Dix on his big report and all the other big world news and
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:32.740]  what else he thinks is most important right now.
[02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:35.940]  But I wanted to play a short clip of her talking about this.
[02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:38.580]  She's a survivor, people were convicted.
[02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:41.220]  It was judges, it was heads of government, but it got shut down.
[02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:47.180]  But they did convict the handlers that kept dungeons and mansions around Belgium of kidnapped
[02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:51.140]  little boys and girls for the elites to rape and murder them.
[02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:53.460]  This is confirmed, convicted, real.
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:54.860]  Here it is.
[02:36:54.860 --> 02:37:05.580]  I was raised in Belgium and sold into a murderous pedophile network right around my sixth birthday.
[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:13.780]  I was used in this network for five years and a half.
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:25.060]  Adult men that were part of this exclusive club were there for various reasons, but there
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:34.380]  was a lot of alcohol, a lot of drugs, and the children were the commodity, the highest,
[02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:44.860]  the most valued commodity and were used for sex mostly, but there were a number of aristocrats
[02:37:44.860 --> 02:37:53.020]  that were part of this club who also liked killing children.
[02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:56.340]  And then my time had come.
[02:37:56.340 --> 02:38:01.020]  At the age of 11, I was about to be killed.
[02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:08.060]  I was tortured because someone who had protected me for a while and then abused me really badly
[02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:10.220]  was done with me.
[02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:21.700]  I was strapped to a butcher's block that was black from the blood of all the children
[02:38:21.700 --> 02:38:28.020]  that had come before me.
[02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:33.380]  I was there for a few hours.
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:42.740]  My body is full of scars, and every scar reminds me of the moment.
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:52.580]  I thought that I was going to be killed like all the children that weren't loved enough
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:57.420]  to live, and I was going to be forgotten as well.
[02:38:57.420 --> 02:39:01.220]  And I wasn't ready to die.
[02:39:01.220 --> 02:39:08.940]  Someone from inside that network loved me enough to rescue me.
[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:15.500]  That torture lasted a few hours, however.
[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:17.220]  And we'll get to the rest of the story tomorrow.
[02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:20.660]  She's given a TED Talk, the police saved her, it all came out.
[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:24.660]  The point is they found dungeons full of children, they declared national security just like
[02:39:24.660 --> 02:39:25.660]  in England.
[02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:29.300]  They have no evidence for all the left defending this, for all of them defending sexualization
[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:30.300]  of children.
[02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:31.500]  They have now signed on to this.
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:32.740]  They need to know that.
[02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:35.900]  Yeah, that is absolutely horrific.
[02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:38.580]  I've never seen that particular clip.
[02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:46.740]  But she mentioned being put down on a black block that had blood stains on it from the
[02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:48.140]  earlier killings.
[02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:50.620]  That sounds ritualistic to me.
[02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:53.460]  That sounds satanic to me.
[02:39:53.460 --> 02:39:56.820]  And when you look back at where this stuff is coming from, when you were saying, I didn't
[02:39:56.820 --> 02:40:00.740]  make this up, well, who did make this up, you could track it back to guys like Aleister
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:07.980]  Crowley, who quite literally wrote about ritual sex magic, and that you are able to obtain
[02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:13.180]  some sort of power from the spirit world when you engage in this ritualistic sex magic.
[02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:19.620]  And now we see that powerful, influential billionaires, politicians, famous people,
[02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:24.260]  you know, artists, musicians, are quite literally engaging in these things.
[02:40:24.260 --> 02:40:27.940]  And I'm happy to see that there's actually people starting to speak out about this.
[02:40:27.940 --> 02:40:31.940]  No doubt the left is going to call people like that liars.
[02:40:31.940 --> 02:40:35.900]  But I think more and more of this stuff will be like a trickle effect.
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:40.300]  It's like when one girl accuses Harvey Weinstein or something, all of a sudden a hundred others
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:42.500]  feel, hey, maybe it's my time to speak up.
[02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:46.300]  Well, what we need is more people like this brave lady to stand up, because I have no
[02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:48.900]  doubt more of this has been going on behind the scenes.
[02:40:48.900 --> 02:40:53.740]  And I think we're going to start to see more of it come out as this continues to exponentially
[02:40:53.740 --> 02:40:54.740]  grow.
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:58.580]  So it's absolutely horrifying and sickening to see something like that.
[02:40:58.580 --> 02:41:02.260]  But again, I'm not too surprised, but I'm glad to see it being exposed now.
[02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:03.260]  I agree.
[02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:06.260]  I remember what came out two years ago, even the New Yorker magazine reported on it.
[02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:09.980]  The German government placed tens of thousands of children with convicted pedophiles in a
[02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:13.780]  quote study and ordered them to rape them for more than 40 years.
[02:41:13.780 --> 02:41:15.460]  This is a cult.
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:18.020]  Yeah, it really is a cult.
[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:22.220]  It's like a brainwashed cult.
[02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:24.340]  You look at what brainwashed cults are like.
[02:41:24.340 --> 02:41:31.180]  It's almost like an MK ultra program that they've been indoctrinated with here.
[02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:35.980]  Because you look in their eyes, Alex, like when I'm at this protest and we're just sitting
[02:41:35.980 --> 02:41:38.700]  here saying, why are you guys protected?
[02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:40.380]  Why do you want to sexualize children?
[02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:42.420]  It's just like they're gone.
[02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:44.260]  They're like zombies who aren't even there.
[02:41:44.260 --> 02:41:46.020]  They're not capable of a debate.
[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:49.900]  That's for sure because I think they know that they're on the wrong side of history.
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:53.780]  Honestly, I think some of them don't even understand why they're protected.
[02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:56.500]  Well, I can tell you, I can take one look at those groups and they always are busting
[02:41:56.500 --> 02:41:57.500]  them.
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:41:59.020]  Most of them have been abused themselves.
[02:41:59.020 --> 02:42:00.020]  Yeah.
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:01.340]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:08.380]  A lot of this is stemming from a past abuse and unfortunately, it's trickling onto the
[02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:11.260]  children and that's where we take issues.
[02:42:11.260 --> 02:42:16.260]  If you want to identify, whatever you want to identify or have sex with the same sex,
[02:42:16.260 --> 02:42:17.260]  that's fine.
[02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:18.260]  I don't care.
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:19.260]  I really don't.
[02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:20.260]  It's not my business.
[02:42:20.260 --> 02:42:21.260]  Go at it.
[02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:24.820]  But as soon as you involve the little ones, the children, the toddlers, that's when it
[02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:29.100]  becomes an issue for me and I'm certainly going to speak out even at the risk of having
[02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:31.820]  my YouTube channel canceled or whatever, it doesn't matter.
[02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:34.780]  This is the most important thing moving forward, obviously.
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:36.260]  This is the big issue.
[02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:37.260]  Absolutely.
[02:42:37.260 --> 02:42:39.060]  In their attempt to censor, you will only make you fight harder.
[02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:43.140]  Let's come back and talk about China, the lockdowns, big picture, new world order, the
[02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:46.980]  incredible tyranny in Canada, the attacks on free speech with Dan Dix, final segment
[02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:50.580]  with him and I'll get a few more calls ahead of Gerald Salente taking over for everybody
[02:42:50.580 --> 02:42:54.900]  that's holding Josh, Leo, Joe, Justin, Trent and Bob, get to your calls as well.

[02:44:02.980 --> 02:44:03.980]  It's been worked out.
[02:44:03.980 --> 02:44:04.980]  We didn't do that.
[02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:10.780]  Do you think I would metaphysically tell you something that this is the very best I can
[02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:11.780]  get?
[02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:13.540]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[02:44:13.540 --> 02:44:19.380]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product because
[02:44:19.380 --> 02:44:22.780]  I want that good will.
[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:25.860]  What I do to you, I do to myself, don't you get the big secret?
[02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:28.580]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[02:44:28.580 --> 02:44:30.700]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:37.300]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:48.660]  Look it up, find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:54.220]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil, just like
[02:44:54.220 --> 02:44:58.700]  our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4store.com.
[02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:01.260]  It's a post COVID world now.
[02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:05.020]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:06.260]  There's a solution.
[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:07.260]  The wellness company.

[02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:45.580]  and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new world that we're
[02:45:45.580 --> 02:45:46.580]  living in.
[02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:53.300]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.

[02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:10.260]  the globalist.

[02:47:00.060 --> 02:47:13.500]  Introducing a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:15.980]  Welcome back to the final segment of the third hour with Dan Dix.
[02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:17.980]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:47:17.980 --> 02:47:20.460]  Also Dan Dix for a while has had a great channel on man.videos.
[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:26.860]  He has found his forbidden information and latest reports going back through an archive
[02:47:26.860 --> 02:47:33.980]  at pressfortruth at man.video and also his great website, pressfortruth.ca.
[02:47:33.980 --> 02:47:40.060]  Let's put Klaus Schwab on screen.
[02:47:40.060 --> 02:47:44.780]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote a lot of books back in the 70s that I read in the early 90s.
[02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:51.340]  He explained that global elites control organized crime, including pedophilia, in one of his
[02:47:51.340 --> 02:47:52.340]  books particular.
[02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:59.300]  It was the technotronic age between two ages, I forget which one, but he said they use it
[02:47:59.300 --> 02:48:03.500]  to control people and so that's exactly what's going on here.
[02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:05.700]  That's what Epstein was doing.
[02:48:05.700 --> 02:48:11.580]  So we know their MO and my uncle never told me about a lot of secret stuff but he was
[02:48:11.580 --> 02:48:19.820]  a heavily decorated Vietnam helicopter pilot and his name was William Forrest Hammond and
[02:48:19.820 --> 02:48:25.740]  about a year before he died, about nine years ago, he died eight years ago, I was out at
[02:48:25.740 --> 02:48:31.700]  his farm ranch, we were riding around checking the fences and I asked him, I said, I know
[02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:34.740]  you were in Iran Contra, you never really talk about it, but your mom knows something
[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:40.020]  about it, you were down there building airfields, what made you get out of it and actually his
[02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:47.420]  best buddy that was down there, they had become stronger Christians, I knew he had a deep Christian
[02:48:47.420 --> 02:48:52.660]  conversion, he was already Christian but he really got born again and his partner got shot
[02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:57.540]  up and killed, he was in the jeep with him, almost died because they had been leaders
[02:48:57.540 --> 02:49:02.580]  down there involved in the government operation and he said it was children and he said I
[02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:08.020]  can't tell you, it's too secret but he said that the US government was smuggling orphans
[02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:12.300]  out of Guatemala and loading them on planes and really bad things was happening and he
[02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:15.620]  said listen, I'm going to tell you anymore, it's too dangerous.
[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:22.020]  So my uncle did work for Army Special Operations and the CIA and he did tell me that before
[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:23.020]  he died.
[02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:31.260]  So again, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not run into this type of stuff and this
[02:49:31.260 --> 02:49:35.140]  is what makes or breaks you, other people get high enough in the government of corporations,
[02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:39.220]  they run into it and they say no, they're not part of the club, if they say yes, they're
[02:49:39.220 --> 02:49:43.700]  part of the club and it starts with free hookers and money and then it's oh, that girl you
[02:49:43.700 --> 02:49:47.780]  had sex with, she's 16 and then it's oh, you're going to have sex with a 10-year-old
[02:49:47.780 --> 02:49:50.860]  and then it's well, we need you to get rid of this kid, they're a problem, they'll strangle
[02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:53.860]  them and by the way, we're going to videotape it.
[02:49:53.860 --> 02:49:58.500]  That's what Epstein was doing, they weren't just raping children, they were murdering
[02:49:58.500 --> 02:49:59.500]  them.
[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:03.660]  Dan Dick's closing comments on this and then just other big picture with what's happening
[02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:06.060]  in the world and where you see things going.
[02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:09.780]  Well, just to touch on what you were just saying, I mean look at what's happening with
[02:50:09.780 --> 02:50:10.780]  Kanye West.
[02:50:10.780 --> 02:50:15.340]  I don't really follow celebrities a lot but he is not going along with this stuff, as
[02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:19.420]  you said, he seems to be speaking out about it and then he tried to expose the fact that
[02:50:19.420 --> 02:50:23.900]  his personal trainer was trying to have him taken out with drugs and stuff and then we
[02:50:23.900 --> 02:50:30.220]  find out that his personal trainer is a Canadian military man who dealt in psychological operations
[02:50:30.220 --> 02:50:32.540]  involving drugs.
[02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:39.100]  So there is an effort behind the scenes to not only silence certain people who are aware
[02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:42.380]  of what's happening, but also to promote certain people who are-
[02:50:42.380 --> 02:50:47.140]  And the so-called trainer of the stars said in text messages, we'll drug you out, you'll
[02:50:47.140 --> 02:50:50.340]  be a zombie in an institution forever if you don't shut up.
[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:57.540]  Yeah, he literally said that in a text message and Kanye exposed that and again, this is
[02:50:57.540 --> 02:51:03.620]  maybe a little bit of the first glimpse in behind the scenes in Hollywood at how handlers
[02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:08.020]  can actually be used to control and manipulate people or at least to keep people in line
[02:51:08.020 --> 02:51:13.100]  because a guy like Kanye has a massive, massive amount of influence and reach and that is
[02:51:13.100 --> 02:51:15.940]  scary to the powers that ought not to be.
[02:51:15.940 --> 02:51:20.180]  That is something that they find troubling and of course it has to be managed behind
[02:51:20.180 --> 02:51:25.140]  the scenes and now with guys like him who seem to be a little bit unmanageable, people
[02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:29.100]  are starting to learn that, wow, this stuff actually goes on behind the scenes.
[02:51:29.100 --> 02:51:32.700]  They try to silence certain people, they try to promote others who are going along with
[02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:38.180]  it and this is why we have to continue to expose this stuff for what it is, otherwise
[02:51:38.180 --> 02:51:41.660]  it's just going to continue to happen, Alex.
[02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:45.820]  It really is and now they're externalizing their method of evil trying to rape all our
[02:51:45.820 --> 02:51:46.820]  bodies with these shots.
[02:51:46.820 --> 02:51:51.100]  What do you think of China biggest protest in the history of 60 plus years under the
[02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:52.100]  communists?
[02:51:52.100 --> 02:51:53.620]  We've got to really stand with those folks.
[02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:59.140]  Well, it's a time that's come, I mean, they've been put under this no COVID pressure for
[02:51:59.140 --> 02:52:03.740]  so long that of course it's going to erupt into this and people have to understand that
[02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:06.580]  China is the blueprint for the West.
[02:52:06.580 --> 02:52:12.180]  They often test things out over there to see how we're going to deal with it over here
[02:52:12.180 --> 02:52:18.780]  and I'm starting to see some signs that China is now, Canada is now morphing into a similar
[02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:25.740]  blueprint and a test area for how these crazy authoritarian COVID 1984 nightmare procedures
[02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:27.820]  are going to be carried out.
[02:52:27.820 --> 02:52:30.700]  Look at what Justin Trudeau was doing.
[02:52:30.700 --> 02:52:35.300]  When I went to cover the trucker rally, Alex, I had to drive for six days across the country.
[02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:39.060]  I couldn't fly within my own country because I'm unvaccinated.
[02:52:39.060 --> 02:52:42.820]  I took a baton to the ribs from the police for covering that.
[02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:44.620]  I'm still dealing with that.
[02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:46.540]  This is all over this COVID 1984 nightmare.
[02:52:46.540 --> 02:52:49.740]  Look at British Columbia right now, Bill C 36.
[02:52:49.740 --> 02:52:55.700]  They want to quite literally stop doctors from spreading misinformation about the vaccine
[02:52:55.700 --> 02:53:02.660]  and charge people up to $200,000, maybe even throw them in jail for refusing to go along
[02:53:02.660 --> 02:53:04.140]  with this medical tyranny.
[02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:05.140]  So I mean-
[02:53:05.140 --> 02:53:06.420]  And Claude Schwab, you're right.
[02:53:06.420 --> 02:53:12.220]  Claude Schwab says Justin Trudeau is the model of leaders that they're installing.
[02:53:12.220 --> 02:53:18.740]  He, Schwab quite literally bragged about the fact that he has guys like Trudeau and Macron
[02:53:18.740 --> 02:53:24.220]  and the New Zealand Prime Minister and others essentially under his thumb as what he called
[02:53:24.220 --> 02:53:31.340]  world economic juniors, world economic forum juniors who have been shaped and molded to
[02:53:31.340 --> 02:53:33.380]  bring about this great reset.
[02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:35.420]  That's why they're all talking about it openly.
[02:53:35.420 --> 02:53:40.580]  And yeah, China is absolutely shocking what's going on there, but people need to pay attention
[02:53:40.580 --> 02:53:46.300]  to what's happening in Canada too because they've really, really pushed their boundaries
[02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:47.820]  here in Canada.
[02:53:47.820 --> 02:53:49.500]  Canadians are noticing what's going on.
[02:53:49.500 --> 02:53:50.500]  They're speaking out.
[02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:55.140]  Hopefully they get as brazen as what's happening in China because as I understand it, this
[02:53:55.140 --> 02:54:02.420]  is very rare for the Chinese to become this vocal actually saying get Xi Xi out of there.
[02:54:02.420 --> 02:54:07.780]  Again, it's a protest whose time has come because this COVID-1984 nightmare, as you
[02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:14.020]  know and as your audience know, is fully about control, clearly has nothing to do with health.
[02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:20.340]  It's all about mandating this global inoculation program, getting us under this health umbrella
[02:54:20.340 --> 02:54:23.340]  for the purposes of control.
[02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:24.340]  So yeah.
[02:54:24.340 --> 02:54:27.140]  And what's crazy is they now admit that everywhere.
[02:54:27.140 --> 02:54:30.300]  What is that doing to your credibility and others is not about, oh, we're credible, but
[02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:32.980]  we've reached that paradox where everything we said has come true.
[02:54:32.980 --> 02:54:34.740]  I'm just seeing our credibility explode.
[02:54:34.740 --> 02:54:38.340]  I don't see how the system deals with that because if we weren't around, if our listeners
[02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:41.580]  weren't around promoting this, I'm letting folks know the good news folks, we really
[02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:43.100]  fought them to a standstill.
[02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:46.740]  They would be winning right now, but they're not because the world's waking up fast.
[02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:49.300]  How do they strike back then?
[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:55.420]  Well, perhaps that's our position in this war, in infowars and in press for truth, is
[02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:58.100]  to continuously push back against this and expose this.
[02:54:58.100 --> 02:55:03.140]  And I suppose the only thing they can do is to play dirty, right?
[02:55:03.140 --> 02:55:08.660]  Go behind the scenes and try to have us shut down or censored in any way they can.
[02:55:08.660 --> 02:55:13.100]  But as we spoke about earlier, Alex, that only amplifies our voice.
[02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:16.660]  I think he once famously said, you know, like the Star Wars thing, strike me down and I'll
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:19.580]  become bigger and more powerful than you could have ever imagined.
[02:55:19.580 --> 02:55:20.580]  Well that's what's happening really.
[02:55:20.580 --> 02:55:21.580]  That's right.
[02:55:21.580 --> 02:55:24.140]  As long as we don't decide they've beaten us, we only get stronger.
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:29.500]  We just have to persevere and trust in God and we'll get stronger and stronger.
[02:55:29.500 --> 02:55:30.500]  Well exactly, Alex.
[02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:33.860]  That's why I said in the beginning of this, I'm seeing this current banning as a bit
[02:55:33.860 --> 02:55:35.540]  of a blessing in disguise.
[02:55:35.540 --> 02:55:41.780]  I think, you know, when sometimes when certain doors are closed like that, it leads to an
[02:55:41.780 --> 02:55:47.700]  opportunity of other doors being opened that you may have not have even known was a possibility.
[02:55:47.700 --> 02:55:53.020]  So I'm really looking forward to the future of continuing to do what I do here at Press
[02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:57.020]  for Truth because there's really no way of shutting me down.
[02:55:57.020 --> 02:55:59.700]  Same with you, you know, less than killing us.
[02:55:59.700 --> 02:56:01.500]  I mean, that's the only possible way.
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:04.340]  But let's talk about that briefly.
[02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:06.180]  That's why they want internet power outages and things.
[02:56:06.180 --> 02:56:09.460]  The only way they can do it is that I'm really worried about them doing a fake cyber attack
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:12.020]  when you see Claude Schwab hyping that.
[02:56:12.020 --> 02:56:13.020]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:18.260]  I mean, you've been talking about the coming of, you know, internet 2.0 for quite a long
[02:56:18.260 --> 02:56:24.420]  time and really they have the power to flip the switch at their fingertips at any given
[02:56:24.420 --> 02:56:25.420]  moment.
[02:56:25.420 --> 02:56:30.380]  But that's not to say that we don't have the ability to use this technology to our advantage
[02:56:30.380 --> 02:56:31.380]  as well.
[02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:33.420]  You know, it's a double-edged sword.
[02:56:33.420 --> 02:56:38.940]  And we're really at that fork in the road now where you can't be on the fence anymore
[02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:41.900]  ladies and gentlemen, if you're watching Alex Jones, if you're watching me at Press
[02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:45.820]  for Truth and you're thinking, man, maybe I should start doing something like these
[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:46.820]  guys.
[02:56:46.820 --> 02:56:47.820]  There's no excuse anymore.
[02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:48.820]  You can start a website.
[02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:50.860]  You can start a channel on these platforms.
[02:56:50.860 --> 02:56:53.700]  You can get out there, get your voice amplified.
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:59.780]  And again, it virtually cost nothing these days to do so.
[02:56:59.780 --> 02:57:02.580]  So there's really nothing holding anyone back at this stage in the game.
[02:57:02.580 --> 02:57:05.940]  I want to encourage all the viewers watching this that if you're on the fence, if you're
[02:57:05.940 --> 02:57:09.540]  thinking, I'm just one little person, what can I do?
[02:57:09.540 --> 02:57:13.020]  All you got to do is dive in headfirst and start doing it.
[02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:17.020]  And when you're honest, you're genuine, you're truthful, you present good info, the truth
[02:57:17.020 --> 02:57:21.100]  will resonate with people and you will start to build a credible audience and then you
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:26.500]  can contribute to the info war that guys like Alex Jones have been at the tip of the spear
[02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:27.500]  of fighting.
[02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:28.500]  All right.
[02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:29.500]  Well, great job.
[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:30.500]  We'll launch the August situation.
[02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:31.500]  Join us again very, very soon.
[02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:32.500]  Press for truth.ca.
[02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:34.420]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:57:34.420 --> 02:57:35.420]  Thank you.
[02:57:35.420 --> 02:57:36.420]  All right.
[02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:37.420]  Thank you.

[02:59:49.420 --> 03:00:01.620]  Meeting of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:01.620 --> 03:00:05.780]  We've got 15 minutes left and I'm hosting the amazing Gerald Salente's taking over.
[03:00:05.780 --> 03:00:07.780]  Let's talk to Bob and Florida Bob.
[03:00:07.780 --> 03:00:09.420]  Thanks for holding during that Dan Dixon interview.
[03:00:09.420 --> 03:00:10.420]  Go ahead.
[03:00:10.420 --> 03:00:11.420]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[03:00:11.420 --> 03:00:12.420]  Good to talk to you.
[03:00:12.420 --> 03:00:13.420]  Good talk to you.
[03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:18.420]  Listen, I wake up most of the morning trying to figure out what I can do to help save
[03:00:18.420 --> 03:00:19.420]  America.
[03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:24.300]  I go to sleep that way, too, by the way, and I come up with some ideas and I'm so honored
[03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:26.100]  to be able to share this one with you.
[03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:30.180]  By the way, I take Nations I Dine, my wife does, and last year we bought it for Christmas
[03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:31.180]  presents.
[03:00:31.180 --> 03:00:32.180]  Thank you.
[03:00:32.180 --> 03:00:35.020]  I just got off the phone, my wife's with her and she said she's going to be ordering
[03:00:35.020 --> 03:00:38.980]  a bunch of other products to do the same for Christmas gifts.
[03:00:38.980 --> 03:00:43.940]  But listen, here's my idea, picture a truck going down the road that's got magnetic signs
[03:00:43.940 --> 03:00:44.940]  on it, right?
[03:00:44.940 --> 03:00:51.580]  Nowadays, they have magnetic dry erase signs, and what I'm looking forward to is for your
[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:56.380]  message of the week that will go out on the air, whether it's once a week, once every
[03:00:56.380 --> 03:01:00.460]  two weeks, and I'll be able to write it on my sign.
[03:01:00.460 --> 03:01:07.540]  You'll be selling the sign, the blank dry erase signs, and you'll be putting that message
[03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:11.940]  out every week, and you'll have a separate strip with just your logo on it, so people
[03:01:11.940 --> 03:01:14.780]  begin to know the logo.
[03:01:14.780 --> 03:01:19.020]  You would always encourage, fit like me, I would encourage my family member, and I'd
[03:01:19.020 --> 03:01:22.820]  say I want two sets of them signed, I want one for me and one for my family members.
[03:01:22.820 --> 03:01:26.420]  And next thing you know, I'm seeing it all around my own town, because I'm encouraging
[03:01:26.420 --> 03:01:32.220]  people to buy these signs and get ready for the message, it's kind of like the Christmas
[03:01:32.220 --> 03:01:35.740]  story when the little kids waiting for the secret message of the week.
[03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:40.380]  They've got really inexpensive magnets that go on your door that are dry erase, we sell
[03:01:40.380 --> 03:01:44.340]  them for like five bucks a cost, and we have a message of the week, people write that on
[03:01:44.340 --> 03:01:45.340]  it, stick it on their car.
[03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:47.340]  Can you do it for me, please?
[03:01:47.340 --> 03:01:51.420]  Yes, I'm going to get on it, believe me, listeners have so many great ideas.
[03:01:51.420 --> 03:01:56.540]  That's exciting, that's exciting, I'm so glad to hear that, and I just want you to
[03:01:56.540 --> 03:02:01.780]  know what you were talking about, the children and everything, one person can make a difference,
[03:02:01.780 --> 03:02:06.980]  my wife stood up against a Broward County school board and made a difference, you know, we
[03:02:06.980 --> 03:02:08.740]  got people all around us.
[03:02:08.740 --> 03:02:12.980]  Oh, they're so scared of parents peacefully at school boards, they went into panic mode,
[03:02:12.980 --> 03:02:16.220]  because of the grass roots that's involved, it's game over for these suckers.
[03:02:16.220 --> 03:02:20.660]  That's exactly right, and if you can folks, take your kids out of public school, home
[03:02:20.660 --> 03:02:26.380]  school, and I ask you on a private school for home schoolers, we cover the whole state
[03:02:26.380 --> 03:02:27.880]  of Florida, we don't go outside of Florida.
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:30.900]  Beautiful, what's the name of it, I might move there.
[03:02:30.900 --> 03:02:33.140]  It's Family Tree Private School.
[03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:36.820]  Family Tree Private School, God bless you brother, let's go to Josh in West Virginia, Josh go
[03:02:36.820 --> 03:02:37.820]  ahead.
[03:02:37.820 --> 03:02:40.820]  Hey Alex, are you yummy?
[03:02:40.820 --> 03:02:42.820]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[03:02:42.820 --> 03:02:47.860]  Okay, there's so much going on, this may seem a little strange, but we know the ultimate
[03:02:47.860 --> 03:02:49.340]  battle is for the soul, right?
[03:02:49.340 --> 03:02:50.340]  Yes sir.
[03:02:50.340 --> 03:02:55.700]  So, I believe that the current incarnation of the Catholic religion is one of the greatest
[03:02:55.700 --> 03:03:01.660]  deceit of humanity, I believe they're pulling people away from God.
[03:03:01.660 --> 03:03:08.540]  I mean, they pray to Mary, which is blasphemy, I mean in the Bible in John 14.6, Jesus says
[03:03:08.540 --> 03:03:12.980]  I'm the way, the truth and the life, none shall get to the Father except through me.
[03:03:12.980 --> 03:03:18.260]  They depict Jesus as a helpless baby, and Mary is this sacred figure, have your crew
[03:03:18.260 --> 03:03:23.300]  pull up if they can, just look for a Catholic Mary art.
[03:03:23.300 --> 03:03:28.780]  And I guarantee the majority of all the images will have her depicted with this ring behind
[03:03:28.780 --> 03:03:36.780]  her head, this sun, this glowing circle, but apparently it's like tied to the sun God worship.
[03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:43.740]  And I thought they put a ring around the saints heads, it's Mary too, all of them, the saints
[03:03:43.740 --> 03:03:47.380]  too, yeah, but it's apparently like the sun God worship thing.
[03:03:47.380 --> 03:03:51.700]  Brother, you know, I know there's some Catholics that serve evil, there's some Protestants
[03:03:51.700 --> 03:03:53.860]  to do, I know there's good Catholics to fight the neural order.
[03:03:53.860 --> 03:03:57.660]  I mean, are you saying you don't think any Catholics are Christians?
[03:03:57.660 --> 03:04:03.980]  No, no, so I want to be careful there because I think it's been co-opted or something evil
[03:04:03.980 --> 03:04:08.100]  because like, shameless of freedoms, I love that guy, you know, and I think he's a really
[03:04:08.100 --> 03:04:12.020]  great person, but I think they're being misled away from God.
[03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:15.420]  You know, they pray to Mary, come on, that's blasphemy.
[03:04:15.420 --> 03:04:23.020]  Ah, Josh, I appreciate your call, you know, my issue is I love everybody, I know a lot
[03:04:23.020 --> 03:04:26.580]  of great Catholics, I know a lot of great people, period, and I don't even go to any
[03:04:26.580 --> 03:04:30.180]  church because these churches are all so controlled, I go to a few churches, you know, but not
[03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:35.660]  a regular one, and I'm just not here judging people, I mean, I do say the Pope does some
[03:04:35.660 --> 03:04:39.900]  bad things, I disagree with him, but a lot of Catholics are his biggest critics, so
[03:04:39.900 --> 03:04:44.140]  I just want to, no matter how you were brought up to love God, love Jesus, and try to fight
[03:04:44.140 --> 03:04:49.820]  corruption and evil, but I hear your points, all right, Joe, Leo, Justin, and Trent, we're
[03:04:49.820 --> 03:04:57.740]  coming back in 60 seconds, go write your phone calls.
[03:04:57.740 --> 03:05:03.100]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[03:05:03.100 --> 03:05:08.020]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:13.700]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[03:05:13.700 --> 03:05:19.300]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, that made
[03:05:19.300 --> 03:05:25.180]  any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Info Wars, despite the massive
[03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:31.060]  law fair being waged against Info Wars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[03:05:31.060 --> 03:05:36.300]  Info Wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[03:05:36.300 --> 03:05:41.300]  lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps Info Wars on the air, and what that
[03:05:41.300 --> 03:05:47.340]  does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[03:05:47.340 --> 03:05:53.420]  So continue to do it, go to places like InfoWarsStore.com, go to the places like Save Info Wars, continue
[03:05:53.420 --> 03:06:00.420]  to keep Info Wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:51.420]  Final segment, Joe Salante, a great trans forecaster, is set to take over in a moment. Joe in California,
[03:06:51.420 --> 03:06:58.420]  you're on the air, welcome. Hey, Alex, I wanted to say thank you for everything. Get all your
[03:06:58.420 --> 03:07:04.420]  products, everybody always says that, I get your coins, I got your great reset book. We
[03:07:04.420 --> 03:07:10.660]  wouldn't be on air without you, Joe. I appreciate that and I appreciate you. You're out fighting
[03:07:10.660 --> 03:07:17.620]  for us and I wanted to just say a couple of things. One, thank you, you personally made
[03:07:17.620 --> 03:07:22.540]  a great influence on my life, it made me stop drinking alcohol. I don't know, you've said
[03:07:22.540 --> 03:07:24.980]  a couple of times you were thinking about that, but I don't know if you've...
[03:07:24.980 --> 03:07:29.620]  No, I've quit on and off. I don't think moderate drinking is bad, but it's definitely overdrinking,
[03:07:29.620 --> 03:07:35.900]  not a good thing. And I also started going back to church because of you and I hope that
[03:07:35.900 --> 03:07:41.140]  God can get us out of this mess. I want to be clear when I talk about God. I love God,
[03:07:41.140 --> 03:07:46.940]  I love Jesus. I never claim to be a perfect person and that I'm better than somebody.
[03:07:46.940 --> 03:07:51.980]  I'm saying God is the answer, the devil is the problem, there's team freedom, team demon,
[03:07:51.980 --> 03:07:58.580]  this is a spiritual battle, it's real. 100%, 100%. A couple of things you could help me
[03:07:58.580 --> 03:08:03.340]  out with, since you've helped me out so much. Two things, one, I can't get my kids to eat
[03:08:03.340 --> 03:08:09.940]  any of your products like the gummy D3 or take the X2, which I think is amazing. I don't
[03:08:09.940 --> 03:08:13.180]  know if there's anything you can say because it says Alex Jones on... What do your kids
[03:08:13.180 --> 03:08:19.620]  like to drink, like oranges? Yeah, I tried to give them that. They won't be able to taste
[03:08:19.620 --> 03:08:25.700]  the half a dropper of X2 or X3 in their oranges. So I just stick it in there and they're not
[03:08:25.700 --> 03:08:31.820]  knowing, okay. But the D3 gummies taste great. Why wouldn't they want those? I don't know.
[03:08:31.820 --> 03:08:37.580]  Because it says Alex Jones on the package and they're brainwashed, unfortunately. Well,
[03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:44.300]  I would show them online videos of doctors how good D3 is. And 100%, yes. And my youngest
[03:08:44.300 --> 03:08:48.580]  daughter doesn't get out, she's, you know, unfortunately captured by her phone like most
[03:08:48.580 --> 03:08:52.660]  kids now. And so she just spends in a room all day. So I'm like, at least take these
[03:08:52.660 --> 03:08:57.180]  because you don't get them. Well, why don't you just take the phone away? Oh, well, because
[03:08:57.180 --> 03:09:02.660]  she's not just a kid, she's 19, but... Oh, that's different. No, I hear you. Well, get
[03:09:02.660 --> 03:09:06.980]  her to put the phone down and go for a hike with you, brother. That's an excellent idea.
[03:09:06.980 --> 03:09:11.140]  One last thing before I leave you today, is there anything you can help me with? I have
[03:09:11.140 --> 03:09:14.980]  family members that have taken the jab and they're still taking the jabs and the boosters
[03:09:14.980 --> 03:09:19.020]  and stuff like that. And I just, I don't have anything I can send them. I send them all that
[03:09:19.020 --> 03:09:24.580]  suddenly died video links and stuff, but I just don't have a verbiage to say, please listen
[03:09:24.580 --> 03:09:26.700]  to this or... Well, the British Medical Journal is the most
[03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:31.140]  respected in the world. They came out three weeks ago and said the shot doesn't work.
[03:09:31.140 --> 03:09:34.540]  It's all over the... It's time in British Medical Journal warns of COVID vaccines. There's
[03:09:34.540 --> 03:09:38.940]  major controversies. I cover it day after day here. I mean, you can just send them that.
[03:09:38.940 --> 03:09:42.900]  It doesn't protect them. And if they want to get better from taking the shots, I'm not
[03:09:42.900 --> 03:09:47.980]  a doctor, but doctors have said, Ivermectin helps stop the replication. You got to take
[03:09:47.980 --> 03:09:53.180]  it in cycles according to the doctors. Helps stop the replication of the spike protein
[03:09:53.180 --> 03:09:57.660]  either from the virus or from the shot. Thanks for the call. But I mean, a lot of folks got
[03:09:57.660 --> 03:10:01.740]  to learn the hard way. Let's go and talk to Leo in California. Leo, go ahead.
[03:10:01.740 --> 03:10:06.460]  Hey, Alex. Long time listener, big fan. Just after the call, could you pass it back to
[03:10:06.460 --> 03:10:11.140]  the crew members so I can pass some information on? But I wanted to know, because I don't
[03:10:11.140 --> 03:10:15.660]  share drinks or food or hook up with anybody who's vaxed. And I was wondering, can the
[03:10:15.660 --> 03:10:21.100]  vax be transmitted to non-vaxed people through sexual contact or blood or vaginal fluid or
[03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:25.180]  semen or saliva, since we know it can be transmitted through breast milk?
[03:10:25.180 --> 03:10:28.580]  Yeah. I mean, I'm not a medical doctor, but I've had hundreds of them on and there's
[03:10:28.580 --> 03:10:34.180]  major studies out that, indeed, just like you can get the virus that produces the spike
[03:10:34.180 --> 03:10:40.180]  protein at a lower level, the shots make your cells produce it and that there is some sloughing.
[03:10:40.180 --> 03:10:45.220]  Pfizer study showed for about two weeks of someone who's been injected. So if they rubbed
[03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:51.020]  up against you, you put your hand in your eyes or your mucus membrane, you could get
[03:10:51.020 --> 03:10:55.460]  a viral spike protein replication according to the science I've seen.
[03:10:55.460 --> 03:11:01.700]  Okay, because I got my blood tested recently and I tested positive for the spike protein,
[03:11:01.700 --> 03:11:08.260]  even though I've never been vaxed, but I may have contracted COVID. Is that what that
[03:11:08.260 --> 03:11:09.260]  could be from?
[03:11:09.260 --> 03:11:11.740]  Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but absolutely, that's what's going on.
[03:11:11.740 --> 03:11:15.220]  All right. Well, yeah, just ask Dr. McCullough or anybody.
[03:11:15.220 --> 03:11:21.100]  Well, I mean, we know it's the virus. People say the virus isn't real. No, they're counting
[03:11:21.100 --> 03:11:27.780]  a bunch of viruses is doing it, but the shot creates a triggered event in the cells that
[03:11:27.780 --> 03:11:32.060]  make your cells create the most deadly part of the virus, which is a cell replicating
[03:11:32.060 --> 03:11:33.780]  protein or prion.
[03:11:33.780 --> 03:11:41.460]  Okay, so I don't have to worry about it. Well, here's the deal. Just because you test positive,
[03:11:41.460 --> 03:11:46.260]  most of these tests are fake. They're now admitting that a regular antigen test is
[03:11:46.260 --> 03:11:51.220]  usually the flu. But what we know is way worse than even getting the virus is taking the
[03:11:51.220 --> 03:11:53.220]  shot. Thanks for the call.
[03:11:53.220 --> 03:11:57.900]  Let's go to Justin in Florida after Trent. Trent in Las Vegas, you're up first. Go ahead,
[03:11:57.900 --> 03:11:58.900]  Trent.
[03:11:58.900 --> 03:12:04.340]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Peace and blessings. I think the number one crime committed in throughout
[03:12:04.340 --> 03:12:10.700]  history has been omitting the name of the most high. The most high. His name is Yahua.
[03:12:10.700 --> 03:12:19.820]  Hallelujah. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Joshua, Obadiah. All these names have meaning. So the messiah,
[03:12:19.820 --> 03:12:25.580]  the messiah's name is Yahuza. The word God is a derivative of one of the fallen angels
[03:12:25.580 --> 03:12:30.180]  mentioned in the book of Enoch. He's actually the third ruler of the Gregori. He's actually
[03:12:30.180 --> 03:12:34.380]  the one who led Eve astray. So therefore he is the talking serpent.
[03:12:34.380 --> 03:12:39.220]  I mean, I understand it's important to know how to pronounce God's name in different languages,
[03:12:39.220 --> 03:12:41.980]  but I think if somebody calls out to, you know, the name Jesus, people can say that's
[03:12:41.980 --> 03:12:45.460]  an occult name. As long as I'm not real God, God's going to recognize it. But I hear you.
[03:12:45.460 --> 03:12:50.060]  Is it Yahweh? Yeshua? Or does everybody argues how to say it? Or how are you saying, say
[03:12:50.060 --> 03:12:51.060]  it?
[03:12:51.060 --> 03:12:58.020]  Yahua. Yahua. And in all throughout the scriptures, there is all throughout the scriptures were
[03:12:58.020 --> 03:13:02.620]  instructed call on his name that we bear his name. Even one of the 10 commandments warns
[03:13:02.620 --> 03:13:08.780]  us not to take his name in vain. Exodus 315 says, this is my name forever. And this is
[03:13:08.780 --> 03:13:15.100]  how I am to be remembered in every generation. Over 6,000 times in English translated, English
[03:13:15.100 --> 03:13:21.540]  translated Bibles. So they've replaced Yahua with the Lord or God.
[03:13:21.540 --> 03:13:27.820]  Interesting. Interesting. I appreciate your call, Trent. Anything else? You're gone. Justin
[03:13:27.820 --> 03:13:29.860]  in Florida. Go ahead. Last caller.
[03:13:29.860 --> 03:13:36.780]  Hey, Alex. Appreciate it. Love you guys, the crew, everything you guys do. Long time listener
[03:13:36.780 --> 03:13:41.500]  actually started listening to you by someone in a store while I was in the middle of a
[03:13:41.500 --> 03:13:48.540]  rant. Yeld over the island says, are you Alex Jones? And I said, who's that? And they showed
[03:13:48.540 --> 03:13:50.540]  me and been listening ever since.
[03:13:50.540 --> 03:13:55.420]  I'd like to go through some things. Basically, I've been fighting these guys since I was
[03:13:55.420 --> 03:14:01.140]  in kindergarten when teachers were spanking people and blocking kids and closets and whatnot.
[03:14:01.140 --> 03:14:06.300]  Quick go into the doctor since I was 11. But I want to just touch on a few things. I
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:14.500]  have a word and a battle cry. And if they say we should, I say we don't, just say shouldn't.
[03:14:14.500 --> 03:14:18.620]  And just take the call for being fine.
[03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:25.820]  Sir, your phone's breaking up. I appreciate your call. All right. The great Gerald Salunte

[03:15:53.500 --> 03:16:01.420]  trend forecaster takes over. Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly
[03:16:01.420 --> 03:16:08.100]  stolen day by day, counting these mail-in ballots. And it's absolutely absurd for anyone
[03:16:08.100 --> 03:16:14.540]  to take our election seriously when we just it's election month, Alex. It's not election
[03:16:14.540 --> 03:16:21.340]  day. And that's the problem. And everything changed after COVID-19. They illegally changed
[03:16:21.340 --> 03:16:27.540]  state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple
[03:16:27.540 --> 03:16:32.180]  ballots to people. Well, this isn't any way to run an election. We're in a serious country
[03:16:32.180 --> 03:16:36.860]  when we have elections that can be stolen like this. And I believe that just like I
[03:16:36.860 --> 03:16:42.220]  believe the election was stolen in 2020. And I have no problem saying that. And it is so
[03:16:42.220 --> 03:16:47.660]  absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity
[03:16:47.660 --> 03:16:53.860]  and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are. We're not election
[03:16:53.860 --> 03:16:57.500]  deniers. We're election realists.
[03:16:57.500 --> 03:17:01.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November
[03:17:01.620 --> 03:17:08.340]  through Christmas. But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[03:17:08.340 --> 03:17:16.140]  Not just up to 60% off with promo code 1776, but on top of it, double patriot points and
[03:17:16.140 --> 03:17:21.380]  what makes this the most special sale ever. Every order will get a free gift, no matter
[03:17:21.380 --> 03:17:27.500]  how small or how big, and it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer. So
[03:17:27.500 --> 03:17:33.940]  you might order a sticker pack for $5. You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $495
[03:17:33.940 --> 03:17:40.300]  and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $800. So again, some of the gifts are sticker
[03:17:40.300 --> 03:17:46.300]  packs, some of them are Alex Jones, Halloween masks, some of them are books, films, InfoWars
[03:17:46.300 --> 03:17:51.460]  flags, American flags. There are hundreds of different items. It's all random. InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:17:51.460 --> 03:17:57.220]  every order gets a free gift. Free gifts for every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:57.220 --> 03:18:03.100]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[03:18:03.100 --> 03:18:08.460]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:18:08.460 --> 03:18:12.300]  The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away, your ability
[03:18:12.300 --> 03:18:15.500]  to speak freely. So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go
[03:18:15.500 --> 03:18:17.980]  for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[03:18:17.980 --> 03:18:22.140]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[03:18:22.140 --> 03:18:26.460]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[03:18:26.460 --> 03:18:30.140]  your support. And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the
[03:18:30.140 --> 03:18:34.460]  planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[03:18:34.460 --> 03:18:38.940]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because
[03:18:38.940 --> 03:18:42.860]  of your past support. So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical

[03:19:55.300 --> 03:20:03.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:25.300 --> 03:20:30.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[03:20:33.780 --> 03:20:38.180]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, and you know, I was listening to Alex taking some
[03:20:38.180 --> 03:20:43.300]  questions and callers, and he talking about how, you know, he's a believer in Jesus.
[03:20:44.260 --> 03:20:51.860]  Well, you know, the story coming out this past weekend was that this guy,
[03:20:51.860 --> 03:21:00.020]  who they call him the Dean of Trinity College, and said that Jesus could have been transgender.
[03:21:00.580 --> 03:21:06.980]  I mean, what Dean? You know, I can't stand the names they give to clowns like officials,
[03:21:07.860 --> 03:21:14.980]  minister, dean, dean, little dope. How about dope? Jesus was transgender. What did you get?
[03:21:14.980 --> 03:21:21.060]  Your packet cut off? I mean, what are you talking to? And why are they quoting clowns like this?
[03:21:21.060 --> 03:21:31.940]  You know why? Because it's a clown show. It's a global freak show right in front of your eyes.
[03:21:34.020 --> 03:21:40.580]  One after another, we got the freaks in control. The big headline news.
[03:21:40.580 --> 03:21:50.980]  Yeah. Front page. The Wall Street Journal. I pay five dollars a day for this. Five dollars.
[03:21:53.780 --> 03:21:59.380]  The New York Times. The toilet paper record. Here it is. Another big picture. Same story.
[03:22:00.020 --> 03:22:04.500]  Three dollars a day. Oh, your trends journal is less than three dollars a week.
[03:22:04.500 --> 03:22:10.900]  150 pages. We give you news you could use. There you go. Cambridge Dean defense sermon.
[03:22:12.180 --> 03:22:17.860]  Why would you quote a jerk like this? Anyway, going back,
[03:22:21.300 --> 03:22:32.180]  it's all about protest spread and challenge in China about the COVID. They're fighting against
[03:22:32.180 --> 03:22:39.220]  this thing being locked down and all of the media, all of the Western media.
[03:22:40.820 --> 03:22:48.020]  This is from DW. The German news agency over there just came out.
[03:22:51.300 --> 03:22:59.940]  Global governments urged China to respect COVID protests. The United Nations also called on Chinese
[03:22:59.940 --> 03:23:06.100]  authorities to respond to protests in line with international human right laws.
[03:23:07.380 --> 03:23:17.220]  What a bunch of crap. You low life pieces of garbage. Hey, how about when we had protests?
[03:23:18.100 --> 03:23:25.380]  Hey, great job over there. True dope over there did up in Canada with their emergency act.
[03:23:25.380 --> 03:23:34.180]  Freedom convoy. What freedom convoy? We're putting in an emergency act. You're going
[03:23:34.180 --> 03:23:42.740]  to jail and we're stealing your money because you're protesting our COVID vaccine law.
[03:23:44.340 --> 03:23:54.580]  Talking about China, we got China town everywhere. Matter of fact, you look at the clown that's
[03:23:54.580 --> 03:24:00.260]  playing the Republican Senate Majority Leader. Yeah, what's his name over there?
[03:24:02.020 --> 03:24:09.140]  McConnell. Yeah, I got more chins than China town. Look at this little clown boy. Look at that
[03:24:09.140 --> 03:24:17.380]  arrogant little nothing of a boy and I'll call that to his face. A little daddy's boy. A little
[03:24:17.380 --> 03:24:25.460]  daddy's boy. Born on third base and dirty in a home run. A little piece of nothing. Emergency
[03:24:25.460 --> 03:24:35.700]  act, old but those dirty Chinese. All those lousy Chinese. But we can lock down everybody. There he
[03:24:35.700 --> 03:24:44.980]  is. These are the clowns telling us what to do like that little jerk off over there in Trinity
[03:24:44.980 --> 03:24:54.740]  College telling you that Jesus was transgender. I wonder why your mother was war on or your daddy.
[03:24:55.300 --> 03:25:03.060]  Maybe he was Lola. Lola. L-O-L-L-O-L-A. Yeah, like the guy that we got that guy. What's his name?
[03:25:03.620 --> 03:25:09.220]  Playing our defense, not defense. They had the health minister in the United States.
[03:25:09.220 --> 03:25:15.780]  I think I'll become whatever I want to become today and you have to believe what I swallow.
[03:25:17.460 --> 03:25:26.740]  This hypocrisy. This hypocrisy. How they've destroyed the lives and oh, I'm Italian. American. My
[03:25:26.740 --> 03:25:33.540]  blood is Italian. My heart's American. Well, my heart is still a true American of what America
[03:25:33.540 --> 03:25:41.540]  used to be. There he goes. Lola. L-O-L-L-O-L-A. You're going to take orders from a clown like that?
[03:25:41.540 --> 03:25:48.100]  You're going to tell me about health? Hey, hey, moron boy, girl, whatever. I worked on the book
[03:25:48.820 --> 03:25:58.900]  Natural Healing back in 1995. Water book about building up your immune system.
[03:25:58.900 --> 03:26:04.020]  Oh, no, we can't talk about that. You've got to take the drug. You've got to take the drug.
[03:26:04.020 --> 03:26:12.260]  So the drug deal is 95% of the C-rate. The garbage of going after China, when they destroyed the
[03:26:12.260 --> 03:26:17.620]  lives and livelihoods, they're going back to Italy. The first one to follow the Chinese way,
[03:26:17.620 --> 03:26:25.780]  locking down everything, locking down everything. And one country after another. And the morons,
[03:26:25.780 --> 03:26:32.020]  the imbeciles. You've got to stand six feet apart. The wind blows exactly in six feet.
[03:26:32.020 --> 03:26:38.260]  It doesn't go in circles or up and down. Now you stand six feet apart and we'll make circles all
[03:26:38.260 --> 03:26:51.460]  over the floor. And you're going after China. This isn't my America. Oh, InfoWiz has the spirit
[03:26:51.460 --> 03:27:02.100]  of 1776 sales. Tomorrow I'm going to be 76. And I have the spirit of 1776. I'm a fighter for freedom.
[03:27:03.220 --> 03:27:10.180]  As I said, my blood is Italian, but my heart's American. I'm a Napolitano born in the Bronx,
[03:27:10.180 --> 03:27:15.460]  born to be free. And I got these clowns robbing me of my freedom. Calm down,
[03:27:15.460 --> 03:27:24.100]  salenti. Be a coward like the rest of us. Follow this clown. Listen to what he see it says.
[03:27:25.620 --> 03:27:34.100]  Swallow the crap. Those lousy Chinese. What hypocrisy? What hypocrisy?
[03:27:35.300 --> 03:27:40.420]  Closing down restaurants. A third of the dry cleaners have gone out of business now.
[03:27:40.420 --> 03:27:53.460]  Office they can office occupancy rate in Britain in London. 30% in America around 50%.
[03:27:55.380 --> 03:28:03.940]  Locking down everywhere. And that fraud Fauci, the lying little clown telling you not to wear
[03:28:03.940 --> 03:28:12.660]  a mask on CBS and then telling you have to wear one. BS thing about a 96, 95% efficacy rate
[03:28:12.660 --> 03:28:18.020]  with a drug. And now you got to get a booster all the time. And the clown boy gets the virus
[03:28:18.020 --> 03:28:23.860]  after he gets the shots and still keeps selling them. An arrogant little piece of nothing.
[03:28:23.860 --> 03:28:34.900]  Fraud Fauci and he was on NBC yesterday complaining about you're ready, the Chinese and what they're
[03:28:34.900 --> 03:28:46.500]  doing in their lockdowns. Yep. I'm angry. St. Thomas Aquinas said, if you're not angry when
[03:28:46.500 --> 03:28:53.460]  it's moral to be angry, you're immoral. If you're not angry when you should be, we're going to be

[03:31:01.380 --> 03:31:05.940]  is this taking so long? In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[03:31:05.940 --> 03:31:11.460]  Why can't we do this here? The answer is fraud and corruption. If we don't fix the system,
[03:31:11.460 --> 03:31:15.780]  it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSentimonious.
[03:31:15.780 --> 03:31:20.500]  They're going to deny us Michigan. They're going to deny us Pennsylvania. They're going to deny us
[03:31:20.500 --> 03:31:27.540]  Arizona. And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there
[03:31:27.540 --> 03:31:35.300]  is an America first majority in every single one of them. So we need to keep fighting for reform of
[03:31:35.300 --> 03:31:40.100]  the system. Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else. Communications are the
[03:31:40.100 --> 03:31:46.020]  reason why we did well. That's why infowars.com is so damn important. That's why they're so
[03:31:46.020 --> 03:31:51.940]  desperate to take you off the air, Alex. People need to get behind info wars. This alternative
[03:31:51.940 --> 03:31:58.100]  media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important. We need more of these communications,
[03:31:58.100 --> 03:32:05.780]  not less. Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick
[03:32:05.780 --> 03:32:12.180]  and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors. They associated these
[03:32:12.180 --> 03:32:18.260]  poisonous vapors with cold weather. Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that
[03:32:18.260 --> 03:32:26.500]  killed people. What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3. You see the sun via your skin helps
[03:32:26.500 --> 03:32:32.420]  your body produce vitamin D3. But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin
[03:32:32.420 --> 03:32:37.380]  D3. And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body
[03:32:37.380 --> 03:32:42.660]  over. So now it's more important than ever because the winter's here to take high quality vitamin D3
[03:32:42.660 --> 03:32:47.540]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body

[03:32:54.740 --> 03:33:01.380]  immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at infowarstore.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[03:33:01.380 --> 03:33:25.300]  New World Order. It's Alex Jones. You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Gerald
[03:33:25.300 --> 03:33:33.060]  Salente. Hey thanks for having me on the Alex Jones show. No, it's not Gerald Salente. I'm
[03:33:33.060 --> 03:33:38.420]  going to change it. It's going to be Geraldine Salente and I'm changing the name of the trans
[03:33:38.420 --> 03:33:46.500]  journal to the trans journal. All right. That'll make everybody happy. But what a bunch of crap
[03:33:46.500 --> 03:33:56.180]  being shoved down our throats. Jesus was transgender. All a junk of clown like Fauci. I was talking
[03:33:56.180 --> 03:34:06.500]  about the fraud Fauci. This is him on NBC yesterday. Again, if you're stupid enough to watch the
[03:34:06.500 --> 03:34:14.900]  mainstream news, you'll hate the trans journal. It's the truth in trends. If you like, I like Fox,
[03:34:14.900 --> 03:34:21.380]  I like NPR. Yeah, you like swallowing crap. Go ahead. Oh, maybe they got one good guy on
[03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:28.980]  on Fox, you know, how about the rest of the network? Anyway, here's the fraud Fauci talking
[03:34:28.980 --> 03:34:35.860]  about China. This approach has been very, very severe and rather draconian in the kinds of
[03:34:35.860 --> 03:34:46.260]  shutdowns without a seeming purpose. Oh, oh, clown boy. You mean the same draconian lockdowns?
[03:34:46.260 --> 03:34:52.340]  You read the trans journal or maybe you're too stupid to read. We've been calling them
[03:34:52.340 --> 03:35:03.460]  draconian lockdowns when the Landy Cuomo, another arrogant daddy's boy, I'm locking down New York.
[03:35:03.460 --> 03:35:12.580]  And how about Warren really? Oh, you mean de Blasio, the clown nothing scum who real name was
[03:35:13.380 --> 03:35:17.140]  changed to de Blasio because I was his mother's maiden name and want to get the Italian American
[03:35:17.140 --> 03:35:23.380]  vote in New York when he locked down everything. You believe you're stupid. It's a clown show.
[03:35:24.020 --> 03:35:31.860]  It's a freak show. A little boy of nothing. And this Fauci talking about China.
[03:35:31.860 --> 03:35:42.260]  Go back to your trans journal. Back in 2020, we had the magazine cover. The Chinese way you must
[03:35:42.260 --> 03:35:49.620]  obey how America followed everybody a great Anthony Frida cover. Instead of the tanks in
[03:35:49.620 --> 03:35:57.540]  Tiananmen Square, we had a COVID tank. Yeah. He goes on to say the arrogant clown boy Fauci.
[03:35:57.540 --> 03:36:07.620]  This is the guy by the way that championed championed those lockdowns in Australia.
[03:36:08.580 --> 03:36:14.340]  Love them in New Zealand wanted more in America going after the Chinese.
[03:36:15.300 --> 03:36:21.940]  And again, little Chewdope little arrogant Chewdope up in Canada.
[03:36:21.940 --> 03:36:29.700]  Locking up the people for the freedom convoy, a freedom convoy. No, we don't want to get
[03:36:29.700 --> 03:36:34.180]  faxed. We want to keep taking doing our work going back and forth over the border, but we
[03:36:34.180 --> 03:36:43.540]  don't want to get faxed. And look what he did to him. Stole their money. Lock them up. That's fine.
[03:36:44.420 --> 03:36:49.940]  The prostitutes, the media whores that get paid to put out for their corporate pimps and their
[03:36:49.940 --> 03:36:55.060]  government. This is that clown. This is the clown that people obey. Don't forget to vote.
[03:36:55.060 --> 03:36:59.140]  Don't forget to vote. Vote for the clown. The more we're on the imbecile,
[03:36:59.140 --> 03:37:08.660]  the arrogant freak in a country near you. Yep. Yep. There he is. These are the arrogant people
[03:37:10.900 --> 03:37:17.380]  that robbed us of our lives. The prostitutes never went after him. Hey, how about the little boy
[03:37:17.380 --> 03:37:23.940]  Murphy over here over in Jersey? Huh? Remember him? Oh, remember the morons? You got to put the
[03:37:23.940 --> 03:37:28.420]  table six feet apart in the restaurant, but you could sit together. Oh, when you walk in,
[03:37:28.420 --> 03:37:33.220]  you got to put a mouse gone. But when you sit down, you can take it off because China,
[03:37:34.660 --> 03:37:39.940]  China is let us arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, nothing on the clown.
[03:37:42.020 --> 03:37:45.060]  Look at that. Look at that. Look at the elections in the United States.
[03:37:45.060 --> 03:37:51.620]  You go back to one of our recent covers, Democrats versus Republicans, equal bloods versus
[03:37:51.620 --> 03:37:57.700]  Crips, murderers and thieves. What are you people going to grow up in? That's why you're
[03:37:57.700 --> 03:38:02.420]  listening to info wars because you've grown up and you got to do everything you can to support
[03:38:02.420 --> 03:38:08.500]  info wars because they want to get us all off the air. Look, I used to be on with on Oprah.
[03:38:08.500 --> 03:38:16.100]  I got to bring down the mugs I have to today's show. I used to be on Fox and Friends. Good morning,
[03:38:16.100 --> 03:38:24.100]  America. They hate me because I won't swallow their crap or do what I'm told because I'm a free
[03:38:24.100 --> 03:38:33.140]  American. They said a Napolitano born in the Bronx at the height 1946. America wins the war.
[03:38:33.140 --> 03:38:40.420]  The spirit of freedom rang through you. Not anymore. Not anymore. By the way, when I was a
[03:38:40.420 --> 03:38:45.860]  kid, they used to say, you little SOP, you're not going to make it to 21. Yeah, they couldn't
[03:38:45.860 --> 03:38:51.300]  control me, man. I was the youngest of five, you know, so and then I grew up with the perfect
[03:38:51.300 --> 03:38:59.220]  time to be free. So it breaks my heart to see us robbing us of our freedom. And as Alex was saying
[03:38:59.220 --> 03:39:03.620]  before, you know, he doesn't do churches of, you know, he doesn't I don't want to quote him, but,
[03:39:03.620 --> 03:39:08.340]  you know, to paraphrase what he said about, you know, not believing in the different churches.
[03:39:09.300 --> 03:39:13.300]  I mean, it's, you know what's happened? Anthony freedom, just talking with them,
[03:39:13.300 --> 03:39:18.420]  the great illustrator for our Trends Journal magazine. He said politics has become the new
[03:39:18.420 --> 03:39:25.220]  religion. People aren't going to church to go into politics. That's right. They believe in their
[03:39:25.220 --> 03:39:32.660]  political gods. Going back to the fraud Fauci at this clown on all the prostitute media over and
[03:39:32.660 --> 03:39:38.980]  over again. It seems that in China, it was just a very, very strict, extraordinary lockdown
[03:39:39.620 --> 03:39:47.860]  where you lock people in their house. Hey, yeah, like they did over here. Can't go to school.
[03:39:47.860 --> 03:39:58.180]  Oh, look at those videos. No, those little boys playing police locking people up, throwing them
[03:39:58.180 --> 03:40:07.620]  on the ground in Australia and other countries. And how they hate salenti in Kingston, New York.
[03:40:07.620 --> 03:40:17.460]  Oh, yeah, I had a freedom rally when everything was locked down in July of 2020. I died from it
[03:40:17.460 --> 03:40:25.940]  and so did everybody else. How dare you have a freedom rally when little Andy Cuomo, the daddy's
[03:40:25.940 --> 03:40:31.060]  boy, told you to stay home and lock down, close down your restaurants, go out of business. Oh,
[03:40:31.060 --> 03:40:37.620]  you're not essential. Only the bigs are essential. Oh, no liquor stores because they pay high taxes
[03:40:37.620 --> 03:40:46.100]  and we want to get their money. Mom and pop. Yep. Gone. Gone. And we come back. We're going to talk
[03:40:46.100 --> 03:40:53.140]  more about the gone because the economy is gone too. Yeah. Oh, the down's down today. Don't
[03:40:53.140 --> 03:41:03.540]  worry, we'll rig it and pop it back up. Yep. That's Fauci. Yes, which clearly would all do respect
[03:41:03.540 --> 03:41:08.340]  was not particularly affected by talking about their vaccines to any number of vaccines that were
[03:41:08.340 --> 03:41:17.300]  available. Talking about the Chinese. Yep. And it goes on that doesn't fully appreciate that they
[03:41:17.300 --> 03:41:25.140]  didn't protect the elderly by making the elderly get vaccinated. This is the elderly 81 year old
[03:41:25.140 --> 03:41:38.420]  clown that got double boosted and got the virus and the people that are dying. Alex mentioned it
[03:41:38.420 --> 03:41:45.860]  before. The study came out that hardly made the news. Vaccinated people now make up majority of
[03:41:45.860 --> 03:41:53.220]  COVID deaths in us. Nope. Nope. It's not misinformation. Gender information because the
[03:41:53.220 --> 03:41:59.860]  Washington Post put it out. And they go on to say older people were always especially vulnerable
[03:41:59.860 --> 03:42:07.140]  and now make up a high proportion of COVID fatalities. And even before the pandemic,
[03:42:07.140 --> 03:42:18.340]  according to Scientific America. Yep. And clown vouching. We can no longer say this is a pandemic
[03:42:18.340 --> 03:42:24.020]  of the unvaccinated. That's a quote. And that's by the Kaiser Family Foundation Vice President
[03:42:24.020 --> 03:42:28.900]  Cynthia Cox, who conducted the analysis on behalf of the Washington Post.
[03:42:32.420 --> 03:42:38.100]  Yep. Oh, you're unvaccinated. You're going to spread the virus. Oh, no. Remember all those
[03:42:38.100 --> 03:42:43.460]  clowns or the little prostitutes that went to the Washington prostitute show and the and so many
[03:42:43.460 --> 03:42:50.180]  of them got the virus after it and all those comedians. Yep. All right, we're going to take
[03:42:50.180 --> 03:43:14.260]  a break. Remember, support info wars, support the truth. We'll be right back.
[03:43:20.900 --> 03:43:26.340]  American coffee blend has sold out. Bio crystalline has sold out. But what hasn't

[03:44:14.340 --> 03:44:19.140]  should be your next purchase from the info wars store. The rose hips contained within are a part
[03:44:19.140 --> 03:44:25.220]  of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals
[03:44:25.220 --> 03:44:30.820]  found in the hips may even be helpful for variety of health conditions, including those with osteo
[03:44:30.820 --> 03:44:36.340]  arthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc
[03:44:36.340 --> 03:44:41.700]  themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense,
[03:44:41.700 --> 03:44:46.180]  and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both is
[03:44:46.180 --> 03:44:51.540]  often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit,
[03:44:51.540 --> 03:44:56.980]  be sure to check it out at info wars store.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[03:44:56.980 --> 03:45:04.420]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in
[03:45:04.420 --> 03:45:10.820]  many cases in the winter because of something called vapors. They associated these poisonous
[03:45:10.820 --> 03:45:16.660]  vapors with cold weather. Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed
[03:45:16.660 --> 03:45:24.580]  people. What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3. You see the sun via your skin helps
[03:45:24.580 --> 03:45:30.500]  your body produce vitamin D3. But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin
[03:45:30.500 --> 03:45:35.380]  D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body
[03:45:35.380 --> 03:45:40.100]  over. So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[03:45:40.100 --> 03:45:45.060]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload in your

[03:47:38.260 --> 03:47:44.500]  show and again, you know, because that guy that clown over there at Trinity University
[03:47:45.460 --> 03:47:53.060]  said that Jesus is transgender. My name now is Geraldine and the transjournal is now transjournal.
[03:47:53.060 --> 03:48:00.900]  So, you know, we just want to be on the level of how low you can go. Anyway,
[03:48:00.900 --> 03:48:04.100]  if you want to know what in the world is going on, what it means, what's next,
[03:48:04.100 --> 03:48:09.220]  there's no magazine like the one we're putting out. And if you want to keep the truth going,
[03:48:09.220 --> 03:48:13.300]  because they're trying to keep censoring us, you need to support info wars and they have
[03:48:13.300 --> 03:48:18.900]  these great products and they're selling out fast. As I said, I'm going to be 76 tomorrow.

[03:48:23.860 --> 03:48:29.620]  the more you have to do. You don't lessen up your workouts, you increase them.

[03:50:46.020 --> 03:50:49.620]  they're just going to keep stealing it from us more and more and more.
[03:50:49.620 --> 03:51:00.100]  Again, I used to be on everybody. No more, no more. Again, that article that came out on the
[03:51:00.100 --> 03:51:05.300]  Washington Post, it came out on Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, when nobody was paying
[03:51:05.300 --> 03:51:12.980]  attention because everybody's going on Thanksgiving holiday, that the vaccinated now make up the
[03:51:12.980 --> 03:51:22.260]  majority of COVID deaths. Yep. In September 2021, vaccinated people made up just 23% of the coronavirus
[03:51:22.260 --> 03:51:32.020]  fatalities. In January and February this year, it was up to 42%. The report said, and now it's 58%.
[03:51:34.100 --> 03:51:38.340]  Washington Post analysis found that more vaccinated people are now dying of the COVID
[03:51:38.340 --> 03:51:47.060]  disease. And 58% of the coronavirus deaths in August in the US were people who were vaccinated
[03:51:47.060 --> 03:51:57.620]  or boosted. And you got a clown boy like Fauci selling the jab, a clown of nothing.
[03:51:57.620 --> 03:52:06.740]  And again, the hypocrisy of going after China when they destroyed the freedom convoy in Canada,
[03:52:08.660 --> 03:52:16.260]  Australia, New Zealand, draconian lockdowns. I remember over here, they locked down the
[03:52:17.220 --> 03:52:22.740]  school yard, the playgrounds, all the swings were tied up. Kids couldn't go out and play.
[03:52:22.740 --> 03:52:28.340]  You couldn't go to the beach. Little boy de Blasio, you can't go to the beach. How about
[03:52:28.340 --> 03:52:34.900]  arrogant Gavin Newsom? Oh, yeah, yeah, that one of the members of the club goes to the French
[03:52:34.900 --> 03:52:41.620]  laundry. $400 a plate dinners as he locks down everybody else and don't go to the beach. And
[03:52:41.620 --> 03:52:49.940]  the morons reelect the same freaks that rob them of their power, like gruesome Newsom,
[03:52:49.940 --> 03:53:00.740]  Whitlist Whitmere, little guine over there in Ohio. One after another, they reelected the dictators
[03:53:03.700 --> 03:53:07.380]  that used to be America that the Chinese are going after.
[03:53:07.380 --> 03:53:20.500]  Anyway, then there's the Ukraine war, more money going there. And now look at this arrogance,
[03:53:20.500 --> 03:53:29.220]  look at the arrogance, look at the arrogance. And they tell us what to do and the people follow.
[03:53:30.340 --> 03:53:36.180]  So by the way, when I just went to the, you know, and we took a break, the dows down now about
[03:53:36.180 --> 03:53:47.540]  500 points. And the headline in Drudge, one of the headlines right at the top over there is
[03:53:49.220 --> 03:53:57.620]  Economy Biggest Bubble in World History. And that's Robert Kiyosaki who's a friend of mine and
[03:53:57.620 --> 03:54:08.180]  just did a good podcast with him. And I totally agree with it. We are in now, for the worst,
[03:54:08.180 --> 03:54:18.260]  geopolitical and socioeconomic crisis in modern history, probably in written history.
[03:54:18.260 --> 03:54:29.220]  This COVID war has destroyed the lives and livelihoods of people across the planet.
[03:54:29.220 --> 03:54:39.540]  It'll come back. No, it's not coming back. I'm 15 minutes from Woodstock in Kingston, New York,
[03:54:39.540 --> 03:54:48.020]  the first capital of New York State, right across the street when they made the Constitution for
[03:54:48.020 --> 03:54:54.740]  Kingston. Over 70% of America's Constitution comes from here. That's why I bought these buildings
[03:54:55.380 --> 03:55:02.660]  in most historic corners in America. Anyway, so I'm not far from Woodstock. And there are a
[03:55:02.660 --> 03:55:13.300]  couple of weeks ago, my buddy, 10 o'clock at night, dead, dead. No nightlife. Bands playing.
[03:55:13.300 --> 03:55:19.940]  No, remember, no more bands playing, remember? You can't do that. Again, Van Morrison had me,
[03:55:19.940 --> 03:55:30.340]  wanted to meet me this past September. And because he came out against how they were ruining all
[03:55:30.340 --> 03:55:36.100]  the music industry, people couldn't go out and play. He wanted to meet me because he knows I'm
[03:55:36.100 --> 03:55:44.180]  a fighter for freedom as he is. The streets are dead. The whole world has changed. I have a pal
[03:55:44.180 --> 03:55:50.500]  who has a bunch of restaurants. He said, I've been in the business, he said, for 42 years.
[03:55:50.500 --> 03:56:01.620]  He said, this is Van Morrison. What a real fighter of a man. He said, we're taking reservations now
[03:56:01.620 --> 03:56:09.300]  at 5.30 at night. He said, nobody ever went to dinner at 5.30 at night. And places are closing
[03:56:09.300 --> 03:56:14.100]  up at 9 o'clock at night, stop serving. The whole world has changed as a result of this COVID.
[03:56:14.100 --> 03:56:24.100]  And they're going after China for what, America and Europe created? Again, you look at those videos
[03:56:24.100 --> 03:56:30.020]  that the Australian police throwing a woman down to the ground, going into their homes,
[03:56:32.100 --> 03:56:36.580]  talking about China. So going back to the Ukraine war, this is serious.
[03:56:37.700 --> 03:56:43.380]  The United States is sending another $4.5 billion. The number now to Ukraine to keep
[03:56:43.380 --> 03:56:48.580]  blooding in the killing fields is over $70 billion and another $40 billion on the table,
[03:56:50.020 --> 03:56:55.140]  as the homeless are all over the place, as people living paycheck to paycheck.
[03:56:57.060 --> 03:57:03.620]  If we don't unite for peace, we're going to die for war. And we almost did it when they
[03:57:03.620 --> 03:57:09.860]  almost officially announced World War III saying that Russia bombed sent missiles into Poland.
[03:57:09.860 --> 03:57:16.580]  And NATO was ready to unite. So support Info Wars. Do everything you can.
[03:57:17.700 --> 03:57:22.980]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and TrendsJournal, TrendsJournal.com.
[03:57:24.420 --> 03:57:29.300]  The only magazine in the world that gives you history before it happens. The truth and trends

[03:57:35.140 --> 03:57:41.700]  the worst is yet to come. Oh, and watch out for a business commercial real estate sector crash,
[03:57:41.700 --> 03:57:44.580]  the likes of which you've never seen. See you next week.
[03:57:47.140 --> 03:57:51.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year, starting in mid-November
[03:57:51.540 --> 03:57:57.300]  through Christmas. But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[03:57:57.940 --> 03:58:04.980]  Not just up to 60% off with promo code 1776, but on top of it, double Patriot points
[03:58:04.980 --> 03:58:11.460]  and what makes this the most special sale ever. Every order will get a free gift, no matter how
[03:58:11.460 --> 03:58:17.860]  small or how big. And it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer. So you might order
[03:58:17.860 --> 03:58:24.980]  a sticker pack for $5. You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $4.95 and then get something
[03:58:24.980 --> 03:58:30.980]  worth $50, $60, $70, $800. So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs. Some of them are Alex
[03:58:30.980 --> 03:58:36.740]  Jones, Halloween masks, some of them are books, films, InfoWars flags, American flags. There are
[03:58:36.740 --> 03:58:43.060]  hundreds of different items. It's all random. InfoWarsStore.com, every order gets a free gift.

[03:58:56.260 --> 03:59:03.060]  most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about
[03:59:03.060 --> 03:59:11.220]  1 to 2% per year. This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle
[03:59:11.220 --> 03:59:17.140]  loss. Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the
[03:59:17.140 --> 03:59:24.500]  market. The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[03:59:24.500 --> 03:59:30.340]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia,
[03:59:30.900 --> 03:59:36.500]  makaroo from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.
