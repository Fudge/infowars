[00:00.000 --> 00:22.040]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones
[00:22.040 --> 00:33.400]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[00:33.400 --> 00:37.760]  Info wars help to fuel the rumor that President Obama is in ice to support him.
[00:37.760 --> 00:41.240]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:41.240 --> 00:47.080]  I will not let you down, you'll be very very impressed I hope and I think we'll be speaking
[00:47.080 --> 00:48.080]  a lot.
[00:48.080 --> 00:49.720]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:49.720 --> 00:55.440]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:55.440 --> 00:57.960]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:57.960 --> 01:00.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00.800 --> 01:02.200]  Welcome to the Alex Jones radio show.
[01:02.200 --> 01:05.080]  I'm David Knight and we're going to have Alex Jones joining us with a special report
[01:05.080 --> 01:07.160]  from the road in the next segment.
[01:07.160 --> 01:11.240]  Yes, we're going to have Trump be the 45th President to whether or not people like it
[01:11.240 --> 01:12.240]  or not.
[01:12.240 --> 01:13.840]  And of course there's a lot that we're going to be talking about with that.
[01:13.840 --> 01:18.720]  We have death threats being given for entertainers just like they gave death threats to the
[01:18.720 --> 01:20.200]  electoral college electors.
[01:20.200 --> 01:23.480]  I've never seen this kind of stuff before in my life.
[01:23.480 --> 01:27.200]  I don't think anybody alive has seen this type of thing done before.
[01:27.200 --> 01:32.280]  I don't know that people got death threats for being members of the electoral college
[01:32.280 --> 01:33.280]  in the 18th century.
[01:33.280 --> 01:34.280]  This is really unprecedented.
[01:34.280 --> 01:41.120]  But we're going to be talking about John Lewis' most recent attack and of course the
[01:41.120 --> 01:47.560]  fact that we have now 19 Democrat legislators or maybe I should just call them the demagogic
[01:47.560 --> 01:49.200]  party.
[01:49.200 --> 01:50.520]  Who cares whether they're there?
[01:50.520 --> 01:53.040]  Who cares whether or not Hollywood is there?
[01:53.040 --> 01:56.520]  Quite frankly, Hollywood and Broadway, and these are some of the people who have dropped
[01:56.520 --> 01:58.640]  out now because they say that it's death threats.
[01:58.640 --> 01:59.640]  You know what?
[01:59.640 --> 02:03.200]  The real death threat is the death threat to their career.
[02:03.200 --> 02:08.200]  There are going to be repercussions for them if they do this, repercussions on the people
[02:08.200 --> 02:10.160]  who run those places for the most part.
[02:10.160 --> 02:11.280]  You'll never work in this town again.
[02:11.280 --> 02:12.880]  Does that sound familiar?
[02:12.880 --> 02:15.360]  That's really what they're running from and it's a shame to see that.
[02:15.360 --> 02:20.920]  But quite frankly, I think that Hollywood doesn't really fit in in this inauguration.
[02:20.920 --> 02:26.360]  We're quite happy to have Middle America represented with its fife and drum cores and its bagpipes
[02:26.360 --> 02:34.520]  and its majorettes and the small Middle America that is despised by Hollywood and the elite
[02:34.520 --> 02:39.880]  of the left and right coast as they then milk them for every cent for their entertainment.
[02:39.880 --> 02:40.880]  You know what?
[02:40.880 --> 02:42.560]  We're not really entertained by this anymore.
[02:42.560 --> 02:47.400]  It's getting quite old and it's getting to the point where we really can't look beyond
[02:47.400 --> 02:51.040]  your political activism to the entertainment that we pay you for.
[02:51.040 --> 02:55.640]  So there may be some actual repercussions for this for these entertainers who are dropping
[02:55.640 --> 02:57.800]  out who are getting partisan on this.
[02:57.800 --> 03:03.280]  We've got a singer who has a long career on Broadway.
[03:03.280 --> 03:06.160]  She performed for the Reagan inauguration.
[03:06.160 --> 03:07.400]  She performed for both Bushes.
[03:07.400 --> 03:08.960]  She performed for Clinton.
[03:08.960 --> 03:11.520]  She's performed for everybody essentially except for Obama.
[03:11.520 --> 03:14.840]  It's interesting because she's black, a black entertainer.
[03:14.840 --> 03:19.760]  And she was going to perform for Donald Trump's inauguration until she got all of these threats
[03:19.760 --> 03:20.760]  against her.
[03:20.760 --> 03:22.200]  So she's dropped out.
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.120]  Also interesting, like I said, we're going to take a look at the double standard for
[03:26.120 --> 03:27.120]  John Lewis.
[03:27.120 --> 03:29.920]  I understand that he was a civil rights leader.
[03:29.920 --> 03:36.120]  And we have now people like Ben Sasse and Neva Trumper, people like Michael Steele who
[03:36.120 --> 03:40.800]  was the former RNC head and of course I saw him at the DNC when I was there.
[03:40.800 --> 03:42.920]  He was a rock star for the DNC.
[03:42.920 --> 03:45.640]  I don't remember seeing any other Republicans there, interestingly enough.
[03:45.640 --> 03:49.120]  But anyway, he's coming out and saying, I don't go there, Donald Trump, don't you dare
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.720]  criticize John Lewis because he was involved 50 years ago in the civil rights movement.
[03:53.720 --> 03:55.280]  Well, what has he done lately?
[03:55.280 --> 03:56.280]  That's the point.
[03:56.280 --> 04:02.040]  And if he is acting as a political figure, if he's advocating policies that we're against,
[04:02.040 --> 04:10.480]  remember he was one who led the sit in on the floor of the house after the shooting
[04:10.480 --> 04:12.760]  in Orlando trying to get more gun control.
[04:12.760 --> 04:15.720]  If he's going to get involved in policies that we don't agree with, he's not immune
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.760]  from being criticized.
[04:17.760 --> 04:21.920]  And yet, and that's exactly what we have Rand Paul saying.
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.640]  And yet the press is using this to play the race card yet again on Donald Trump.
[04:26.640 --> 04:30.520]  We're also going to take a look at the little kerfuffle that's going on about what's going
[04:30.520 --> 04:33.000]  to happen to the establishment press.
[04:33.000 --> 04:34.000]  They're very upset.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.480]  They said, you're moving us out of the White House, and the press people have for Trump
[04:40.480 --> 04:42.840]  have said, look, you've only got 40-some-odd seats there.
[04:42.840 --> 04:44.480]  We've had over 400 people apply.
[04:44.480 --> 04:49.120]  So as Drudge points out, has a headline, they're actually involving more people.
[04:49.120 --> 04:52.400]  That's a very interesting paradigm there because it's the same thing that's happening on the
[04:52.400 --> 04:55.920]  trade side in globalism, and we'll discuss that a little bit more in the future.
[04:55.920 --> 04:57.320]  Stay with us right after the break.
[04:57.320 --> 05:01.640]  We're going to have Alex Jones joining us.
[05:01.640 --> 05:03.920]  Here's Donald Trump on Twitter today.
[05:03.920 --> 05:07.440]  What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the FBI?
[05:07.440 --> 05:10.680]  Based on the information they had, she should never have been allowed to run.
[05:10.680 --> 05:11.680]  Guilty as hell.
[05:11.680 --> 05:12.920]  They were very nice to her.
[05:12.920 --> 05:15.360]  She lost because she campaigned in the wrong states.
[05:15.360 --> 05:16.420]  No enthusiasm.
[05:16.420 --> 05:19.040]  He left out she's a lying corrupt criminal politician.
[05:19.040 --> 05:23.000]  He also tweeted, the unaffordable care act will soon be history.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  Amen.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.920]  Now, here is Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter.
[05:26.920 --> 05:33.040]  I fully support imposing martial law, delaying the inauguration until Trump is cleared of
[05:33.040 --> 05:34.520]  all charges.
[05:34.520 --> 05:37.240]  All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed.
[05:37.240 --> 05:42.600]  The only problem with that is, there are no charges to be cleared, just fake news allegations
[05:42.600 --> 05:43.600]  that you fall for.
[05:43.600 --> 05:45.720]  Remember her side of the fence before the election?
[05:45.720 --> 05:47.320]  When they go low, we go high.
[05:47.320 --> 05:49.400]  Trump and Republicans need to accept the results.
[05:49.400 --> 05:50.400]  So much for that.
[05:50.400 --> 05:51.800]  Two things were confirmed today.
[05:51.800 --> 05:56.320]  Trump on Twitter is awesome, and Rosie O'Donnell is a hypocritical wine bag moron, Jabba the
[05:56.320 --> 06:10.400]  Hyde in the flesh, this is Owen Shroyer for info wars.com.
[06:10.400 --> 06:17.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[06:17.840 --> 06:26.120]  This Sunday, January 15th, 2017, Alex Jones here reporting from the road.
[06:26.120 --> 06:30.920]  I'll be co-hosting in the shower with David Knight, who's hosting from the info wars news
[06:30.920 --> 06:37.960]  center in Austin, Texas, where we're broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday transmission.
[06:37.960 --> 06:39.280]  These are historic times.
[06:39.280 --> 06:42.840]  I have to preface every segment with that.
[06:42.840 --> 06:47.720]  Incredible, incredible developments are happening on every front, good and bad.
[06:47.720 --> 06:53.440]  But first off today, I want to lay out the fact that Reuters, Associated Press, Yahoo
[06:53.440 --> 07:00.920]  News, AFP, The New York Times, Washington Post, all this weekend have been linked up
[07:00.920 --> 07:01.920]  on DrudgeReport.com.
[07:01.920 --> 07:06.280]  I want to say he's done an amazing job of pointing this out just by linking to their
[07:06.280 --> 07:13.080]  articles that open world government is now being just admitted.
[07:13.080 --> 07:18.120]  They've gone from just a month and a half ago in the New York Times with stories like
[07:18.120 --> 07:24.280]  what is globalism, does it exist, making fun of yours truly in info wars, saying there's
[07:24.280 --> 07:29.440]  no such thing as global corporate government, to having to admit it's real, admit it's
[07:29.440 --> 07:36.080]  being rejected worldwide, and that it's in crisis, and guess who they say he is going
[07:36.080 --> 07:40.000]  to prop up world government and is the hope of their whole system.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.080]  You've heard this here thousands of times, but guess what?
[07:44.080 --> 07:47.080]  They now admit it, communist China.
[07:47.080 --> 07:52.760]  And the reason I keep saying see I told you so is really only info wars, geopolitically
[07:52.760 --> 07:58.200]  analyzed what the communist Chinese were saying, what the Davos group was saying, what Bilderberg
[07:58.200 --> 08:02.560]  group was saying, what the Club of Rome was saying, what the Council on Farm Relations
[08:02.560 --> 08:03.560]  was saying.
[08:03.560 --> 08:09.720]  Again, 200 people or so chair all those major groups I just mentioned.
[08:09.720 --> 08:14.920]  And they are on record pushing a planetary unelected corporate government.
[08:14.920 --> 08:19.800]  And as I've said thousands of times, if we just expose there's a global corporate government
[08:19.800 --> 08:24.760]  that's anti-prosperity, this crony capitalist that picks winners and losers, that is completely
[08:24.760 --> 08:31.480]  authoritarian and oppressive by the very dictionary and encyclopedia definitions, it will fall
[08:31.480 --> 08:33.680]  of its own illegitimacy.
[08:33.680 --> 08:37.040]  And ladies and gentlemen, the reason I keep going over this is, this is the whole ball
[08:37.040 --> 08:38.240]  game.
[08:38.240 --> 08:43.920]  And we are just suddenly seeing devastating defeats for the enemy, bigger than I even
[08:43.920 --> 08:44.920]  envisioned.
[08:44.920 --> 08:50.600]  I expected this to take a decade or more until more of their oppression took place before
[08:50.600 --> 08:51.840]  this awakening took place.
[08:51.840 --> 08:56.240]  So I've been right about everything except the fact that it's imploding faster than
[08:56.240 --> 08:58.440]  I previously thought it would.
[08:58.440 --> 09:02.040]  And there's some good sides of that, there's some bad sides.
[09:02.040 --> 09:05.480]  Because listen, there's still a lot of underlying corruption system-wide if we don't replace
[09:05.480 --> 09:11.280]  it with real prosperity and justice-based economies and don't really promote real independence
[09:11.280 --> 09:17.720]  and freedom system-wide, we're still in an explosive crisis because the public's been
[09:17.720 --> 09:20.240]  dumbed down as a tool of control.
[09:20.240 --> 09:24.920]  The public has been balkanized and turned against each other as a tool of social control.
[09:24.920 --> 09:33.360]  And still those destabilizing dangerous factors are still there leftovers of the whole global
[09:33.360 --> 09:34.360]  system.
[09:34.360 --> 09:38.320]  There are still leftovers, globalism is still in full force and still expanding.
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.240]  But dominoes have begun to fall and set in motion, it's total collapse.
[09:43.240 --> 09:48.640]  So we now need to start discussing, trailblazing, how to come out of globalism, not just your
[09:48.640 --> 09:55.080]  criticizing it and about how oppressive it is, we have to then deploy the known free
[09:55.080 --> 10:01.200]  market, open free society systems that we know are better replacements for it.
[10:01.200 --> 10:07.680]  So again, that said, for your own eyes, go to M4Wars.com, go to DrudgeReport.com.
[10:07.680 --> 10:11.640]  The reason I mentioned Drudge is Drudge is a great job this weekend of just linking to
[10:11.640 --> 10:18.720]  Yahoo and Associated Press and Reuters, which is everywhere with the headlines, global elite
[10:18.720 --> 10:26.280]  look to China to prop up New World Order, global elite Davos group look to China as the backbone
[10:26.280 --> 10:28.680]  of globalism to save it.
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.480]  Again, who told you globalism was basically a plan that left the communist Chinese take
[10:33.480 --> 10:34.480]  over the planet?
[10:34.480 --> 10:35.480]  I did.
[10:35.480 --> 10:42.520]  Who explained that globalism was a deindustrialization program for the rest of the world, except
[10:42.520 --> 10:43.520]  for China?
[10:43.520 --> 10:44.520]  I did.
[10:44.520 --> 10:48.160]  And the reason I keep going over this is not to brag, it's so you understand, we have
[10:48.160 --> 10:50.160]  the enemy battle plan.
[10:50.160 --> 10:53.960]  If we expose the enemy battle plan, it will implode.
[10:53.960 --> 10:57.760]  And you have to understand, we have the enemy battle plan.
[10:57.760 --> 10:59.800]  I don't want to territorialize my research.
[10:59.800 --> 11:01.120]  I don't want everybody to take it.
[11:01.120 --> 11:02.520]  I don't want credit.
[11:02.520 --> 11:05.560]  All I want is people to understand I've done the homework.
[11:05.560 --> 11:09.400]  I've read hundreds of foreign affairs briefings, hundreds.
[11:09.400 --> 11:11.600]  I have read the globalist communiques.
[11:11.600 --> 11:14.960]  I have watched them on C-SPAN and watched the Davos meetings.
[11:14.960 --> 11:16.080]  I have read their writings.
[11:16.080 --> 11:17.840]  I understand their philosophy.
[11:17.840 --> 11:21.440]  I understand the world they're trying to build.
[11:21.440 --> 11:27.000]  And the fact that we are so close right now to their system is completely imploding is
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.840]  a beautiful thing.
[11:28.840 --> 11:33.000]  But that said, let me go over some of these headlines for you since I was mentioning them
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  here on air.
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.720]  Again, I'm on the road.
[11:35.720 --> 11:37.480]  Let me pull these up for you.
[11:37.480 --> 11:44.400]  Reuters, Davos elite struggle for answers as Trump era dawns.
[11:44.400 --> 11:50.600]  Trump is only the figurehead of nationalism and sovereignty and human self-determination.
[11:50.600 --> 11:54.600]  Trump will be the global figurehead of this in history if he delivers and never sells
[11:54.600 --> 11:56.760]  us out.
[11:56.760 --> 11:59.600]  And he will not be the figurehead if he doesn't deliver it.
[11:59.600 --> 12:00.600]  It doesn't matter though.
[12:00.600 --> 12:01.760]  We don't rise and fall with Trump.
[12:01.760 --> 12:06.840]  Notice they're trying to brand it only as Trump, so they hope that they can destroy
[12:06.840 --> 12:11.360]  his name, destroy him, whether he delivers or not, they're going to try to destroy him.
[12:11.360 --> 12:12.360]  Okay?
[12:12.360 --> 12:13.360]  No, no.
[12:13.360 --> 12:17.360]  This is a movement against unelected tyrannical corporate world government that thought we
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.320]  were so stupid it could establish this thing in our face and that we would just let it
[12:22.320 --> 12:27.120]  run on without any control and basically make us slaves.
[12:27.120 --> 12:30.720]  So it breaks down that they're meeting in Davos right now and they also point out Trump
[12:30.720 --> 12:33.480]  didn't send anybody as a representative.
[12:33.480 --> 12:38.000]  That's because Trump doesn't need to go meet with you, a bunch of billionaires scheming
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.680]  on how to manipulate governments to make yourselves tax exempt and screw over the little guy.
[12:43.680 --> 12:46.080]  Davos is an evil group.
[12:46.080 --> 12:50.640]  From its founding, it's been all about transferring power from the nation states, from the people
[12:50.640 --> 12:52.560]  to themselves.
[12:52.560 --> 12:57.480]  Trump is delegitimizing it by not going and preparing to announce the first summit once
[12:57.480 --> 13:02.680]  he gets into office in Raikia-Vec, Iceland, halfway between the United States and Russia
[13:02.680 --> 13:08.360]  in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, just like Reagan and Merkel Gorbachev met 30-plus
[13:08.360 --> 13:15.000]  years ago there, again, showing that it's nation state to nation state that matters
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.560]  and that communicate and the people's representatives, not a bunch of people's representatives running
[13:20.560 --> 13:28.160]  off to hide in the mountains in Davos, landing on their private helicopters in secret to
[13:28.160 --> 13:31.720]  discuss what they're going to do and then going out and giving press conferences to
[13:31.720 --> 13:32.720]  the world.
[13:32.720 --> 13:37.200]  This is about the people taking control through their governments and it's happening and I
[13:37.200 --> 13:40.240]  salute Donald Trump for it.
[13:40.240 --> 13:41.240]  Let's continue.
[13:41.240 --> 13:43.440]  Let's go back to some of the other news articles here.
[13:43.440 --> 13:45.880]  There are a whole bunch of them but where I'm at is not the best internet so it's taking
[13:45.880 --> 13:49.600]  a moment to pull it up.
[13:49.600 --> 13:56.680]  Women's grapple with globalization backlash, again, that's AFP, Yahoo News and then it
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.520]  goes on to break down in an article by Antonio Rodriguez that the whole world is turning
[14:01.520 --> 14:07.400]  against globalism and despite the fact they've pushed all this racial and sex division, women
[14:07.400 --> 14:13.680]  and minorities in record numbers are voting for nationalism and they're voting against
[14:13.680 --> 14:19.920]  globalism, a very, very beautiful time to be alive.
[14:19.920 --> 14:20.920]  Here's another one.
[14:20.920 --> 14:22.960]  This is also out of AFP.
[14:22.960 --> 14:30.400]  Chinese leaders meet Davos elite as voters revolt and you go on and read through the article,
[14:30.400 --> 14:36.720]  they say that the group of 3,000 delegates meeting from the elites in government hope
[14:36.720 --> 14:44.760]  communist China can block populist movements worldwide just like the communist Chinese
[14:44.760 --> 14:50.840]  are in our newspapers lecturing us saying you better shut down fake news, you better
[14:50.840 --> 14:55.440]  control the internet, you better shut down your nationalists, they're a destabilizing
[14:55.440 --> 15:00.280]  force and then computer world everybody else comes out and says thank god for the Chinese
[15:00.280 --> 15:04.160]  government, not mentioning their communists or mass murders, they know how to handle
[15:04.160 --> 15:07.560]  things, boy they've been proven right.
[15:07.560 --> 15:11.640]  That's how disconnected and sick our controlled corporate media is, now we're going to go
[15:11.640 --> 15:15.000]  to break in a moment and I'm going to come back and then I'm going to hand the baton
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.600]  to David after the next segment but I want to get into the bigger news here domestically
[15:19.600 --> 15:24.200]  not just the global awakening against world government and the fact that they can't even
[15:24.200 --> 15:29.040]  deny it exists now, a major information war for victory but Ron Paul coming out in an
[15:29.040 --> 15:34.320]  article on infowars.com, warning that the deep state basically may try to assassinate
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.320]  Donald Trump and how that ties into the inauguration that's coming up and so much more.

[16:13.560 --> 16:15.600]  very, very important.
[16:15.600 --> 16:22.240]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[16:22.240 --> 16:26.040]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out you start
[16:26.040 --> 16:27.040]  dying.

[20:51.160 --> 20:55.920]  major move by the establishment corporate media and rogue elements of our intelligence
[20:55.920 --> 21:02.240]  agencies as well as foreign multinational banking institutions to overturn the populace
[21:02.240 --> 21:06.840]  movement in this country now they still operate like the public irradiates but they're having
[21:06.840 --> 21:11.520]  to admit global governments real they're having to admit their system is unelected non-accountable
[21:11.520 --> 21:14.800]  they're having to admit that they've got a crisis and have to have to solve it the past
[21:14.800 --> 21:19.960]  their answer is authoritarianism have an EU army go into the EU member states and not
[21:19.960 --> 21:25.960]  let them leave that's right that's being announced ignore the Brexit vote which they've now announced
[21:25.960 --> 21:33.080]  and here in america have state-run media come in and block all independent liberty-based
[21:33.080 --> 21:39.880]  media truth-based media now that's a tall order isn't it well they're willing to do
[21:39.880 --> 21:44.000]  it the people that hijacked america and europe have basically set up a corporate world government
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.600]  from our ingenuity our technology our hard work and the oppression and sweat of third
[21:48.600 --> 21:56.720]  world populations as well and so now they are desperate to try to turn the tide of
[21:56.720 --> 22:04.000]  history and are floating all sorts of propaganda about suspension of this election postponement
[22:04.000 --> 22:11.160]  national emergencies martial law this is being trial ballooned everywhere a bunch of democrats
[22:11.160 --> 22:15.720]  aren't going to the inauguration members of congress are saying that trumps illegitimate
[22:15.720 --> 22:21.440]  in the media is giving them a bunch of support and coverage to hope it snowballs and then
[22:21.440 --> 22:26.080]  ron paul comes out in a statement it's up on info wars dot com and says he's really
[22:26.080 --> 22:30.800]  concerned about the deep state overthrowing trump if they can't infiltrate him and nudge
[22:30.800 --> 22:37.560]  him that they could do to trump what they did to jfk in nineteen sixty three in dallas
[22:37.560 --> 22:45.080]  texas now you notice that is echoing exactly what i've been saying for months and again
[22:45.080 --> 22:49.840]  we're on target i told you they try to overturn the delegates that they do recounts i told
[22:49.840 --> 22:54.600]  you they federalize the elections obama did that two weeks ago so they do try to overturn
[22:54.600 --> 23:00.320]  this election now the new election will be under their control let me pull this up from
[23:00.320 --> 23:07.560]  info wars dot com right now because it's so incredibly important and again you can tie
[23:07.560 --> 23:13.320]  all this into the treasonous behavior of ms m going over davos groups as the communist
[23:13.320 --> 23:19.040]  chinese are going to save us and use their economic will to grapple with trump and and
[23:19.040 --> 23:27.000]  they'll keep america in line our own media is so traitorous and so lapdog and so disconnected
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.560]  that they don't think it sounds traitorous and treasonous and bizarre and collaborator
[23:31.560 --> 23:36.800]  to be praising the communist chinese as the corporate saviors to link up with the globalist
[23:36.800 --> 23:41.280]  and the bloombergs of the world to continue to oppress the american people and other
[23:41.280 --> 23:47.240]  populist movements into submission i mean you couldn't write a script like this it'd
[23:47.240 --> 23:51.800]  be like if aliens invaded the earth and the corporations came out and said let's join
[23:51.800 --> 23:57.760]  with the aliens against fellow humans i mean you know the script is that ass backwards
[23:57.760 --> 24:04.720]  it's it's it's so obviously bad guy villain garbage and again it's a huge victory because
[24:04.720 --> 24:11.960]  they're now having to admit it all now here's the story will the cia assassinate trump ron
[24:11.960 --> 24:21.720]  poll warns of more powerful shadow government trump is treading dangerous waters and risk
[24:21.720 --> 24:27.960]  the fate of jfk some max slavo article up on him for wars dot com it isn't just that
[24:27.960 --> 24:32.760]  donald trump routinely thumbs his nose at the establishment insults media figures he
[24:32.760 --> 24:38.280]  sees is unfair and bucks conventional wisdom it is that president elect trump is defying
[24:38.280 --> 24:42.640]  the will of the deep state military industrial complex base of ultimate power in the united
[24:42.640 --> 24:48.640]  states this is why he's treading dangerous waters and risk the fate of jfk and that's
[24:48.640 --> 24:56.800]  what ron paul is saying in an interview posted info wars dot com the story is very important
[24:56.800 --> 25:02.480]  and embedded in the article we've added my emergency message to donald trump that i cut
[25:02.480 --> 25:08.680]  yesterday where i lay all of this out now here's why the so-called deep state people
[25:08.680 --> 25:17.120]  are in big trouble if this was ten years ago a president could not buck you okay but also
[25:17.120 --> 25:22.400]  ten years ago you had people in place who were globalist establishment minions but
[25:22.400 --> 25:26.920]  now the climate is such that even most people in intelligence agencies understand that the
[25:26.920 --> 25:31.120]  global elite controlling things are really nasty bad people it's not the intelligence
[25:31.120 --> 25:36.600]  agencies in the modern era aren't for command and control authoritarian states but that was
[25:36.600 --> 25:40.560]  because they were taught from college that we need authoritarianism to control third
[25:40.560 --> 25:45.480]  world and Arab countries not that the west needs to be under authoritarianism now that
[25:45.480 --> 25:51.560]  was still kind of an arrogant elitist white man's burden rudger kippling angle that came
[25:51.560 --> 25:56.800]  out of the british empire that whole spirit that whole attitude but this goes so much
[25:56.800 --> 26:03.560]  further into actually social engineering society and and creating autocratic systems so that
[26:03.560 --> 26:09.040]  you have a servile dumb population that needs to be led and needs to be controlled so it's
[26:09.040 --> 26:13.680]  a self-fulfilling prophecy the ultimate form of oppression to create a servile dumbed down
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.240]  massive people which which he leads other documents show is their admitted plan so now that we
[26:18.240 --> 26:23.040]  have global government out in the open let's start really dissecting who's behind it special
[26:23.040 --> 26:28.120]  corporate interests that don't want to just defend america or just get rich competing
[26:28.120 --> 26:34.560]  to create powerful weapons systems but groups that are creating weapons systems that are
[26:34.560 --> 26:38.920]  designed to even make our so-called allies dependent and that are designed to actually
[26:38.920 --> 26:44.600]  create wars not stop wars i mean what's the point of creating all these weapons all these
[26:44.600 --> 26:48.720]  systems if they end up destroying the planet what is the point of that they always claim
[26:48.720 --> 26:53.840]  that they're pitching global government in the name of ending war when their global government
[26:53.840 --> 26:59.960]  is actually at war with humanity itself and at war with civilization that is more equally
[26:59.960 --> 27:05.160]  distributed and i don't mean that in some communist term i mean in the free market of ideas they're
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.840]  creating the ultimate class structure where they want data information life extension
[27:09.840 --> 27:14.480]  only transferred to the elites and segregated from the general mass of public in a breakaway
[27:14.480 --> 27:21.360]  civilization system so every once you go to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.320]  and get this article with ron paul basically warning of everything i've warned of the deep
[27:26.320 --> 27:32.720]  state is incredibly inbred it's disconnected from reality its eugenics based in its philosophy
[27:32.720 --> 27:39.240]  and systems and it is the main threat to our planet today i'm not opposing the aristocracy
[27:39.240 --> 27:43.920]  of the planet because i want to be the aristocracy that's the old classic revolution that you
[27:43.920 --> 27:50.240]  know today's revolutionaries tomorrow's you know ruler no i truly want to have a free
[27:50.240 --> 27:56.000]  market renaissance open culture like the forefathers did and i am someone who a hundred percent
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.120]  believes in americanism not globalism globalism is just old corrupt centralized empires we
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.720]  have to have a license to even have a job or a license to create a good and where everything
[28:07.720 --> 28:13.440]  is run by monopolies and inbred elites who run around with their noses in the air i
[28:13.440 --> 28:19.360]  fundamentally hate those inbred elites that do not deserve to rule over us because if they
[28:19.360 --> 28:24.440]  were true leaders they would understand that they could lead and people would follow them
[28:24.440 --> 28:31.080]  and support them but instead they want to rule over us instead of leading by example
[28:31.080 --> 28:36.400]  you are inbred you are degenerate you are anti-human you you you basically project your
[28:36.400 --> 28:42.640]  own self loathing and hatred onto us and you need to fall but the big news is only five
[28:42.640 --> 28:46.560]  days left they're openly now discussing in the news overthrowing the trump election
[28:46.560 --> 28:50.240]  we are right again folks and again i don't like to brag and say we're right we're right
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.400]  we're right you need to understand we have the blueprint we have the program we understand
[28:54.400 --> 28:59.760]  the enemy operation and if we will just spread the word and expose it they will fall they
[28:59.760 --> 29:06.000]  will be defeated it's not justice it's not justice it's the air we're breathing especially
[29:06.000 --> 29:11.840]  for our children the artificial particulates the chemicals is absolutely weighing down

[33:34.000 --> 33:42.160]  the 15th 2017 it's amazing to see the reactions of people that think that we care if they go
[33:42.160 --> 33:47.120]  to the inauguration now we got a lot of hollywood performers who are dropping out some of them say
[33:47.120 --> 33:52.880]  that they are being threatened with death threats and of course i believe that we've seen uh people
[33:52.880 --> 33:58.080]  with the electoral college that have been threatened with uh death threats but of course these entertainers
[33:58.080 --> 34:03.600]  are looking at the death of their career uh they will not work in hollywood again if anybody
[34:03.600 --> 34:08.240]  thinks that they did anything to help donald trump the col kidman is the one who got it right what
[34:08.240 --> 34:14.720]  we're celebrating here is democracy and a peaceful transition of power something that i would think
[34:14.720 --> 34:20.720]  everybody would support but of course we have now i think it the count is up to 19 self-serving
[34:20.720 --> 34:26.800]  publicity seeking democrat lawyers i think we need to call it the demagogic party uh are now
[34:26.800 --> 34:30.960]  saying they're going to boycott or they're going to participate in protests during the trump
[34:30.960 --> 34:35.840]  inauguration fine we don't really need you there we could care less and we're going to talk about
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.640]  that we're going to talk about the people in the press corps that are so bent out of shape about
[34:40.640 --> 34:45.840]  what's happening and of course the top of drudge it said uh trump is going to open this up to more
[34:45.840 --> 34:48.640]  people in the press that's the way you need to understand that so we're going to break that
[34:48.640 --> 34:54.240]  information down for you as well let's look at the developing opposition to trump from paul ryan
[34:54.240 --> 34:59.280]  and of course we said this is going to happen we said that the number one opposition figure to
[34:59.280 --> 35:06.240]  donald trump is going to be paul ryan and now we see that paul ryan and the gop are starting to
[35:06.240 --> 35:12.240]  push back on trumps by america oh we don't want that they pulled it out of the first bill to have
[35:12.240 --> 35:17.200]  that in there they say uh where he said on friday ryan told somebody we're not going to pull the
[35:17.200 --> 35:21.520]  right out from underneath dreamers you know we're not going to send you home if you came here and
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.880]  said you're a dreamer remember dreamers are anybody who comes here up to the age of 31 a foreign
[35:26.880 --> 35:31.440]  citizen who comes here illegally decides they're going to stay and then says that they're dreaming
[35:31.440 --> 35:36.720]  of american benefits and so of course paul ryan is eager to hand that out to them to tell them that
[35:36.720 --> 35:42.080]  they can stay all these dreamers up to the age of 31 they're not going to go out and then of course
[35:42.080 --> 35:48.240]  he was also saying that he's pushing back against donald trump's idea about lobbyists trump said i
[35:48.240 --> 35:51.760]  want to put a ban on people if you're going to come here and serve in the government you're not
[35:51.760 --> 35:56.480]  going to then turn around in a revolving door and become a lobbyist one year after you leave office
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.000]  we're going to make that five years and if you want to be a lobbyist for a foreign country
[36:00.000 --> 36:06.000]  ain't going to happen a lifetime ban paul ryan says i think that's really a dangerous idea
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.640]  he also thinks it's dangerous to have term limits and that's another thing he's opposing donald
[36:10.640 --> 36:13.680]  trump on so we're going to talk about all those things as well before we get to the news though
[36:14.320 --> 36:18.480]  i just want to remind you that we have a special at info wars life dot com this is how we fund
[36:18.480 --> 36:23.440]  our operation we don't get money from george soros like media matters we don't get money from the
[36:23.440 --> 36:31.680]  federal government like npr uh no instead we offer you products that help you to protect your health
[36:31.680 --> 36:37.280]  to protect your safety things like the bulletproof vest inserts the uh the bulletproof vest and the
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.760]  inserts that you can put in your backpack the carbon nanotube uh technology state-of-the-art
[36:41.760 --> 36:47.040]  technology and anti ballistics but i want to focus right now on the specials we have to make
[36:47.040 --> 36:54.480]  our body great again initiative we have discounts from 20 to 30 off we have 20 off secret 12 vitamin
[36:54.480 --> 37:00.560]  b12 that's in a liquid formulation a very good form of b12 very easy way for your body to
[37:00.560 --> 37:07.520]  assimilate it as well we also have 20 off liver shield prostaguard and knockout are all natural
[37:07.520 --> 37:12.240]  sleep aid it's very important for your health to get restful deep sleep and if you're not getting
[37:12.240 --> 37:17.120]  it for some reason you can use a natural aid like knockout to make sure that that happens
[37:17.120 --> 37:23.280]  also we have 30 off survival shield x2 that's our nascent iodine iodine which used to be put into
[37:23.280 --> 37:27.680]  salt and many other food additives because they understood that your body needs a certain amount
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.960]  of it to be healthy uh that's not the case anymore in today's america they put other
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.440]  things that your body needs to be able to fight back against toxins that are in your food your
[37:37.440 --> 37:41.360]  water in your air as they remove essential nutrients that's one of the reasons why we
[37:41.360 --> 37:48.400]  offer these products you can also get supermail vitality 30 off and brain force 30 off my favorite
[37:48.400 --> 37:53.680]  supplement that we have it really helps to focus your mind and after a long absence we now have
[37:53.680 --> 37:59.680]  back and stock dna force it's been out for over a month we've got it back in with an emergency
[37:59.680 --> 38:06.160]  shipment it's very difficult for us to get this key ingredient biopq q costs about 30 000 a batch
[38:06.720 --> 38:13.440]  you can see there's 175 clinical studies you can look at that and see what biopq q does for your
[38:13.440 --> 38:20.560]  body for your dna and we have that back in stock now so to help you get stocked back up we have a
[38:20.560 --> 38:26.480]  10 percent discount and if this runs out it's going to be a little while longer before we get a
[38:26.480 --> 38:31.040]  another backup shipment so that's something to take advantage of right now 10 percent discount
[38:31.040 --> 38:36.640]  is a substantial discount on that product it's probably our premier product in terms of cost
[38:36.640 --> 38:43.040]  because of that very difficult to get an expensive ingredient biopq q now as alex was talking about
[38:43.040 --> 38:50.000]  earlier in the program the news that we saw all day yesterday and still today of course is davos
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.280]  in switzerland the big globalist confab now this is the one that they want you to know about not
[38:55.280 --> 38:59.200]  bill de berg they do the same thing at davos that they do at bill de berg they all get together and
[39:00.240 --> 39:06.160]  have these political leaders and the elites of the press and of business all get together and
[39:06.160 --> 39:12.400]  you know kind of conspire to do things i'm sure nothing at all illegal nothing that would be
[39:12.400 --> 39:17.280]  criminal of course but they want you to know that they're doing it at davos they for some reason
[39:17.280 --> 39:22.880]  tried to keep bill de berg completely secret that's why we show that so much we want you to see who's
[39:22.880 --> 39:27.200]  going there and of course they have a lot of celebrities that show up at davos celebrities
[39:27.200 --> 39:33.040]  that won't be going to the trump inauguration because they're on the other side but i tweeted
[39:33.040 --> 39:36.880]  this out on on my twitter accounts liberty terry if you want to follow it i thought it's an irony
[39:37.520 --> 39:43.200]  that they've now chosen the chinese to be their spokesperson their leader now the chinese premier
[39:43.200 --> 39:49.040]  president is out there in front you know here we have the most hyper nationalistic country
[39:50.080 --> 39:54.320]  and he's supposedly the globalist leader the people who say oh we don't like nationalism we
[39:54.320 --> 40:00.240]  want to warn the world government and yet china is the most hyper nationalist country an aggressive
[40:00.240 --> 40:03.040]  country you can find anywhere i mean look what they're doing in the south china sea
[40:03.920 --> 40:09.600]  right off the coast of the philippines china is also the most protectionist country that you can
[40:09.600 --> 40:16.880]  find isn't it an irony that here we have this protectionist country uh country that is now
[40:17.520 --> 40:21.520]  going to be the spokesperson for all these globalists who say no we have to have open trade
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.880]  open trade is the only way to go no china is about a one-way policy let's talk about a one china
[40:28.880 --> 40:33.360]  policy they got a one-way trade policy that's what china has so when you look at protectionism
[40:33.360 --> 40:36.800]  we look at nationalism all the things that the globalists are supposed to despise
[40:36.800 --> 40:44.320]  is that is the very embodiment of that in china to the greatest degree of any country
[40:44.320 --> 40:49.760]  and greater degree than what donald trump has proposed and yet he is their leader because
[40:49.760 --> 40:56.080]  they have chosen the chinese as the tool to take down the west as alex pointed out and so it's not
[40:56.080 --> 41:03.040]  really an irony it's simply the lies of globalism that we see going on in davos now and of course
[41:03.040 --> 41:08.160]  we have a new world press order that is starting to establish and the wake especially this press
[41:08.160 --> 41:14.000]  conference that we had this last week it's a new order for the press and the press is really really
[41:14.000 --> 41:21.760]  getting upset about the fact that uh there's talk about moving them out of the office of the head
[41:21.760 --> 41:28.720]  in the white house and into an office in the adjacent building and the way most of the press is
[41:28.720 --> 41:33.680]  depicting this is the way the hill does it the hill says trump team is considering evicting the
[41:33.680 --> 41:39.840]  press from the white house as a report well that's not true they're not talking about evicting them
[41:39.840 --> 41:45.360]  they're talking about putting them into a bigger room and rights previous points out that the
[41:45.360 --> 41:49.040]  reason they're doing this is because they've had so many people apply for this he said we can only
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.320]  fit 49 people in that room in the white house we can fit 400 in this other facility that we're looking
[41:54.320 --> 41:59.040]  at if you look at the top of drudge drudge is saying they're it's essentially they're expanding
[41:59.040 --> 42:04.800]  this and again this is an interesting parallel to what they're talking about the wine of the
[42:04.800 --> 42:11.840]  globalists when they start talking about how awful it would be if we had trade deals that
[42:11.840 --> 42:18.480]  worked for america they say oh this would be isolationism this would lead to a smaller economy
[42:18.480 --> 42:24.560]  when reality what it would do is it would open up the economy to some of the small businesses that
[42:24.560 --> 42:29.600]  are locked out of this because only the big boys are allowed to play so that's what's happening
[42:29.600 --> 42:33.920]  that's what we're talking about when we talk about trade and the same way that's what's really
[42:33.920 --> 42:38.960]  happening here with the press corps the big guys who've always had a place to the table
[42:38.960 --> 42:43.680]  who think that they're entitled to this who have been connected to the establishment and say what
[42:43.680 --> 42:49.920]  the establishment tells them to say they have muscled out everybody else and now it's opening up
[42:49.920 --> 42:56.240]  you see it's an opening it's not a closing in both trade and in press it's a new world press order
[42:56.240 --> 43:03.200]  stay with us we'll be right back i want to encourage all of you to remember how high the

[47:55.680 --> 47:59.360]  and of course we've seen chuck schumer say you know what first we don't even know who the
[47:59.360 --> 48:03.360]  supreme court nominee is but as soon as donald trump is one out there we're gonna shut it down
[48:03.360 --> 48:08.160]  we understand that that's partisan politics and yet the thing that bothered me about this
[48:08.160 --> 48:12.720]  was that when donald trump pushed back and said uh what have you done for your constituent
[48:12.720 --> 48:18.400]  slightly you know we understand he was a leader of the civil rights movement when he was 25 50
[48:18.400 --> 48:26.320]  years ago okay but now he's uh in his mid 70s he's had 30 years in congress what has he done for
[48:26.320 --> 48:31.920]  his district what has he done for the country i can't really say i know that he staged a sit-in
[48:31.920 --> 48:37.360]  on the floor last summer after the shooting in orlando trying to get more gun control he hasn't
[48:37.360 --> 48:40.880]  helped the people in his district and that's what donald trump pointed out and then we had all these
[48:40.880 --> 48:45.920]  people like ben sass who's always been with the never trumpers always trying to say he's a
[48:45.920 --> 48:52.400]  non-partisan senator he wants you to see him as rising above the political establishment and yet
[48:52.400 --> 48:57.760]  he was deeply involved in the political establishment trying to shut down somebody who genuinely was
[48:58.480 --> 49:03.680]  out of the political establishment and that was donald trump i guess donald trump took his
[49:03.680 --> 49:08.400]  marketing position he didn't like that then we also have michael steele former head of the rnc
[49:08.400 --> 49:13.680]  saying don't you even go there don't you even go there donald trump don't you even talk about this
[49:13.680 --> 49:19.680]  guy so he's a sacred cow and i guess look without any disrespect for what he did and we're going to
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.080]  talk about what he did here and we're going to talk about things that he's right on that he could
[49:24.080 --> 49:32.160]  work with donald trump on we've got uh robert kennedy jr who disagrees on a whole array of issues
[49:32.160 --> 49:35.920]  with donald trump and yet on the issue that's important that he believes is important that he
[49:35.920 --> 49:39.680]  sees that he can get something done about he's willing to work with donald trump on that issue
[49:39.680 --> 49:45.840]  it'd be great if if john lewis were statesman like that but he isn't he isn't you know we say that
[49:47.040 --> 49:51.920]  and it's always these people who say you can't attack me personally you can't say anything about
[49:51.920 --> 49:57.840]  me because of who i am they're always the ones who engage and ad hominem attacks aren't they
[49:58.960 --> 50:03.200]  and you know there's an element of this before i get into him i gotta say also on the other side
[50:03.920 --> 50:08.400]  i believe that we should be able to criticize donald trump's policies and to criticize donald
[50:08.400 --> 50:14.480]  trump's policies is not necessarily criticizing the man most of these people now are criticizing
[50:14.480 --> 50:19.440]  donald trump the man they're not coming after his policies but i think donald trump actually wants
[50:19.440 --> 50:24.400]  people who will disagree with his policies look at the people he's put in his cabinet
[50:25.120 --> 50:29.280]  they've had some open disagreements with donald trump on some core issues that he campaigned on
[50:29.280 --> 50:34.560]  and you can look at that one or two ways you can either say well donald trump either lied to us or
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.560]  he's selling out or he's being co-opted or whatever i don't think that's the case i think it's more
[50:38.560 --> 50:45.360]  likely that he wants people who are going to be uh looking at offering him dissent and multiple
[50:45.360 --> 50:50.720]  options i think he's a person who has an open mind to things and will examine the facts on
[50:50.720 --> 50:55.120]  both sides of the issues and is not afraid to take an unpopular decision like vaccines
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.680]  or like talking about the missing 28 pages of the 9-11 report so i think he wants people
[51:01.680 --> 51:06.320]  who are going to question the conventional wisdom of the establishment that's what made donald
[51:06.320 --> 51:10.960]  trump and so i think when we talk about policies and we have issues with policies that people in
[51:10.960 --> 51:16.560]  his cabinet or that donald trump might talk about i don't i always get from people who are following
[51:16.560 --> 51:20.400]  for wars that like donald trump they come after me he's like don't you ever say anything about
[51:20.400 --> 51:24.480]  donald trump well i'm not saying anything about donald trump i'm talking about his policies and
[51:24.480 --> 51:28.240]  like i pointed out i think he is open to hearing dissent or he wouldn't have the kind of people
[51:28.240 --> 51:34.560]  that he has in his cabinet but let's talk about john lewis okay this guy was a leader of the civil
[51:34.560 --> 51:40.080]  rights movement as i pointed out 50 years ago and we'll talk about that in a moment but here's what
[51:40.080 --> 51:44.640]  he had to say about donald trump that started all of this it's an interview with chuck todd
[51:44.640 --> 51:50.480]  on mbc here's what he had to say you have forged relationships with many presidents
[51:52.480 --> 51:56.800]  do you plan on trying to forge a relationship with donald trump you know i believe in
[51:56.800 --> 52:03.680]  and forgiveness i believe in trying to work with people um it's going to be hard it's going to be
[52:03.680 --> 52:11.840]  very difficult uh i don't see this president elan as a legitimate president you do not consider
[52:11.840 --> 52:20.880]  him a legitimate president why is that i think the russians participated in helping this man get
[52:20.880 --> 52:27.360]  it there we go the russians did it okay so that's there we are we're back to selling this again how
[52:27.360 --> 52:31.360]  long will they continue with this and that's the whole point about making him illegitimate
[52:32.320 --> 52:36.880]  about trying to say they can come after him and also about tying his hands in terms of the coal war
[52:37.440 --> 52:41.360]  and if john lewis doesn't realize that that's what this is ultimately about the deep state trying
[52:41.360 --> 52:46.720]  to tie donald trump's hands in the cold war trying to uh stop him from deescalating the coal war
[52:46.720 --> 52:53.200]  that the deep state started with the aid of obama uh then he's being used as a dupe by those people
[52:53.200 --> 52:57.040]  but this is why donald trump responded he said congressman john lewis should spend more time
[52:57.040 --> 53:01.360]  he put this out on twitter should spend more time on fixing and helping his district which is in
[53:01.360 --> 53:06.880]  horrible shape and falling apart not to mention crime infested rather than falsely complaining
[53:06.880 --> 53:12.880]  about the election results all talk talk talk no action or results isn't that sad and you know it
[53:12.880 --> 53:18.560]  is sad because there's a lot of things that he could work with donald trump on he opposed the tpp
[53:18.560 --> 53:25.040]  he opposed these trade issues when they came up uh he also opposed the 2000 trade agreement with
[53:25.040 --> 53:30.880]  china see he could work in the opposition to nafta and the opposition to the chinese trade
[53:30.880 --> 53:36.320]  agreements he could work with donald trump you know he also opposed dragnet surveillance by the
[53:36.320 --> 53:42.800]  nsa when it was done by bush but he didn't oppose it when it was done by obama start to get
[53:42.800 --> 53:49.120]  the picture he doesn't really care about these issues or he would work against it when obama
[53:49.120 --> 53:54.240]  does it not just when bush is doing it and he would work with donald trump on opposing nafta
[53:54.240 --> 53:58.080]  on renegotiating nafta on renegotiating the chinese trade agreements there's a lot of things
[53:58.080 --> 54:03.440]  that john lewis could make common cause with that he could work to make things better for his district
[54:03.440 --> 54:08.320]  to work to make things better for america but instead he has chosen to play these little
[54:08.320 --> 54:14.960]  demagogic tricks and that's the essence of the democrat party but i don't guess i'm most disappointed
[54:14.960 --> 54:19.760]  in are these so-called republicans these rhinos like michael steele as i pointed out i saw him at
[54:19.760 --> 54:24.800]  the dnc and he was a rock star with the democrats i don't recall seeing any other republicans there
[54:24.800 --> 54:30.400]  but people were just all around him and patting him on the back he was a big celebrity and this
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.440]  is what he had to say let's play this clip from michael steele and be his question legitimacy
[54:35.440 --> 54:41.920]  number one don't tweak that number two don't go there yeah um yeah you can't talk about it you
[54:41.920 --> 54:47.120]  can't criticize it i can try to appreciate what's being said and what the concern is now yeah you
[54:47.120 --> 54:52.240]  can put it in a partisan context you know he's a democrat and i'm a republican he's black i'm white
[54:52.240 --> 54:57.920]  and all of that but it goes to what you were just saying about what's undergirding that and how does
[54:57.920 --> 55:04.960]  a community perceive um your respect or lack of respect for their leaders right yep uh and and that
[55:04.960 --> 55:10.320]  says a lot and i think if you're if you're looking to heal and bridge and and bring the people of
[55:10.320 --> 55:15.920]  america together well we're part of that yeah um as black folks we're part of that so our expectation
[55:15.920 --> 55:20.640]  okay let's hold that right there now you heard that clip from john louis and he said i believe in
[55:20.640 --> 55:24.400]  forgiveness but i can't forgive donald trump i can't work with donald trump he's not legitimate
[55:24.400 --> 55:30.000]  say there there's not any room there from people who are so hyperpartisan like john louis
[55:30.640 --> 55:35.600]  and chuck schumer there's no room to reach out to those people in spite of what michael steele says
[55:35.600 --> 55:40.080]  let's play the clip from ram paul because i think he got it precisely right here's what ram paul had
[55:40.080 --> 55:46.960]  to say about partisanism if you're that partisan you are not immune to criticism so i think we
[55:46.960 --> 55:51.920]  shouldn't when things involve race it gets very very sensitive all of us or none of us actually
[55:51.920 --> 55:58.160]  want to be considered to be the racially insensitive and so it's a very very important subject but i
[55:58.160 --> 56:02.960]  think we shouldn't we shouldn't ignore that people are partisan so john louis is a partisan
[56:02.960 --> 56:06.960]  i have a great deal of respect for him but he's a partisan and i disagree with him on issues
[56:06.960 --> 56:11.760]  i should be able to honestly disagree with him and not have it all come back to i have no appreciation
[56:11.760 --> 56:16.240]  for civil rights uh icon because of this and i think that's the part that i think sometimes
[56:16.240 --> 56:22.000]  unfair in this okay that's that's true and that's let's let's go back and look at how he was a civil
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  rights leader he got involved with the freedom riders what were the freedom riders they were
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.960]  people who said look there's been a supreme court decision there's a law saying that you cannot have
[56:30.960 --> 56:36.160]  segregated buses you can't put us in the back of the bus if it's going between states if it's an
[56:36.160 --> 56:41.280]  interstate bus ride because the federal government can have jurisdiction on that unlike when it's
[56:41.280 --> 56:45.760]  strictly within the state and so to make their point and to get the federal government to enforce
[56:45.760 --> 56:50.320]  that they set up a bunch of freedom rides where they had black people and white people get on
[56:50.320 --> 56:55.680]  buses and they were going to drive through the south and go up into washington dc as that happened
[56:55.680 --> 57:00.240]  as they were going through montgomery alabama in 1961 that bus was attacked the the bunches of
[57:00.240 --> 57:06.320]  buses were attacked and they were people were dragged out of that black and white were beaten
[57:06.320 --> 57:14.160]  the buses were burned and the kookluck's clan guy who did that was defended by morris d's the guy
[57:14.160 --> 57:20.640]  who is the president and founder of the southern poverty law center that was morris d's's only
[57:20.640 --> 57:26.880]  involvement in the civil rights movement was to defend the kookluck's clan leader who did that
[57:27.520 --> 57:35.040]  and he got paid what was then the uh the annual the the median family for income but he wanted to
[57:35.040 --> 57:38.880]  make a lot more money and he did and that's what the southern poverty law center is about and we're
[57:38.880 --> 57:44.800]  going to play a clip from that and a clip from a report that i did back in 2014 called profits of
[57:44.800 --> 57:50.400]  hate the splc is always prophesying about hate groups but no it's really about profit pr o f it

[1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:22.400]  this is the heart of 1776 you're a white male it's also what happens when you listen to the radio
[1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:35.680]  host alex jones we pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the american flag info wars
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:41.440]  helped fuel the rumor that president obama is an icis supporter it's been a cozy relationship
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:48.240]  from the beginning i will not let you down you'll be very very impressed i hope and i think we'll be
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:55.600]  speaking a lot donald trump and alex jones this means that donald trump will be the 45th president
[1:00:55.600 --> 1:01:03.120]  of the united states waging war on corruption it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:08.160]  show i'm david night on this sunday january the 15th 2017 we're getting very close to the
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:12.080]  inauguration of donald trump and of course the democrats are stepping up their opposition to
[1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:16.960]  him as we reported on friday and we had michael snider on the radio show he broke down the
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:23.280]  the plans that we have from people like bill ayer's and the leader of the communist party
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:30.160]  and others saying that they want to create disruption and this is a plan to create chaos if
[1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:34.080]  not martial law it's interesting that you see people on the left like roseo donnell
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:38.240]  using the term martial law she spelled it correctly but i don't think she understands
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:43.200]  the definition of martial law if she did she would not be calling for it i don't think but she's
[1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:50.480]  she's out there as a willing dupe for the left for george soros and others i want to get back to
[1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:55.840]  what john lewis is doing because he's part of the effort now to delegitimize donald trump again
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:02:02.800]  saying oh because of the russians no see the thing is he doesn't know who to blame in various
[1:02:02.800 --> 1:02:06.640]  situations if you go back and you look at the shooting that was in orlando what was his response
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:12.800]  to that his response was to hold a to lead a sit in on the house floor and say we're going to sit
[1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:16.640]  here and we're going to stop all business until you bring up some gun control measures to protect us
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:23.440]  from guns see that wasn't the issue the issue was that the government and the department of
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:28.000]  justice and the people local law enforcement they tried to hide the fact from us that he'd called
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:36.480]  into 9 11 and had read a muslim prayer in arabic using the terms a la and so forth or they translated
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:43.760]  as god and so forth it was clearly a situation where you've got a terrorism event but the way
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:50.000]  that they want to the people they want to blame is not the religion of peace no they want to
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  blame peaceful law-abiding american citizens so he doesn't know who to hold responsible for these
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:03.920]  events in the same way that now he's blaming russia for hillary and the dnc failing hillary
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:09.680]  is failing as a candidate the dnc is being exposed as political hacks see that's where the hacking of
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:14.160]  the election came in we found out that the dnc were political hacks who stole the election
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:18.800]  from bernie sanders you want to get upset about something like that then you know about somebody
[1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:24.240]  stealing the election get upset with a dnc what was exposed was the truth about these people
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:29.840]  that they are hacks there was no hacking of voting machines there was nothing that needs to change
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:34.240]  cyber security except to get rid of any voting machines that we have to make it a paper ballot
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:38.640]  situation but that's what they're doing and of course he's not upset about the fact that national
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:43.600]  security was hacked by russia and by every other government on earth because of hillary clinton's
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:48.880]  gross incompetence and criminal negligence and handling secure documents why aren't they upset
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:55.040]  about that well okay we know that they know better and so it isn't just that john lewis
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:59.920]  doesn't know who to blame in the shooting in orlando it isn't that he doesn't know who to blame
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:05.440]  about the documents he blames a whistleblower as always rather than the people who created the
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:10.800]  crimes and so that's the real issue and as i pointed out before if he really wanted to make his
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:14.640]  district better as donald trump pointed out you know he could do things to make his district better
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:18.800]  he's been there for 30 years what has he done for anybody in his district in america nothing
[1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:23.760]  he has opposed and after he opposed the 2000 trade agreement with china but he only opposes
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:28.320]  things like that and nsa surveillance when it's being done by republicans for the most part
[1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:34.560]  and that's what he needs to get beyond is that rabid partisanship and when we come back
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:41.680]  i'm gonna play you something that goes back to his position as a civil rights leader and i think
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:47.280]  this is all very pertinent as we look at the fact that donald trump has been told he can't come to the
[1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:52.960]  black history museum uh they don't want him there to celebrate martin luther king day he'll have to
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:57.360]  come some other time maybe after he's present they'll have to see that's the kind of inclusiveness
[1:04:57.360 --> 1:05:02.160]  we see now from civil rights leaders like john louis stay with us we'll be right back electrify

[1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:21.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david now your host
[1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:28.480]  and i want to continue with the story about john lewis because i think john lewis is deliberately
[1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:33.920]  provoking this attack to be timed with martin luther king day and the black history museum
[1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:39.520]  that's just recently opened in washington dc donald trump is going to go there to honor
[1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:44.320]  the contributions of people like john lewis who had been involved in the civil rights movement
[1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:49.360]  and as i pointed out in the last segment being involved as a freedom writer in that and yet
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:54.080]  he's now being told uh don't come don't come we don't want you here he's trying to reach out
[1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:57.360]  trying to do something trying to honor these people but they don't want it and they're saying
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:03.120]  if you criticize him for his partisan attacks against you if you criticize and push back
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:08.400]  against john lewis because he personally attacks you not even attacking your policies but attacking
[1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:13.040]  you uh then that is over the limit don't even go there said michael steele former rnc head
[1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:17.280]  and of course ben sass jumping in on that as well but most of the left but this is all
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:21.280]  being orchestrated and they're putting john lewis out in front because they want to tie all of this
[1:07:21.280 --> 1:07:29.360]  together along with martin luther king day and do that in the run up to the election again pushing
[1:07:29.360 --> 1:07:35.520]  everything russia did it to tie his hands and deescalating the cold war that obama did that
[1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:39.680]  hillary did their russian reset was a reset of the cold war donald trump wants to deescalate
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:46.240]  these tensions and everybody should support that but we don't want to have a war with russia
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:50.720]  obviously there are people in the american government in the deep state who do in the
[1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:56.640]  military industrial complex leaders the republican and democrat party people like john mccain lindsay
[1:07:56.640 --> 1:08:02.480]  graham they want it just like they wanted to set syria on fire and did set syria on fire we're not
[1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:08.000]  going to let them do it to america you can try to push people back and forth this this democrat
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:14.400]  party is nothing but a demagogue party that focuses on demographics they pick one group against another
[1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:20.080]  and they shift back and forth uh do a quick 180 whenever it suits them and the perfect example
[1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:26.560]  of this is the southern poverty law center and morris d's as i pointed out it's ironic isn't it
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:31.200]  that john lewis who became a civil rights leader mainly because of his freedom riders and those
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:37.280]  freedom riders were attacked their buses were burnt people were beaten and morris d's defended the
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:45.600]  kukluk's clan isn't that interesting can john lewis find it within him to forgive morris dees of
[1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:52.800]  course he can because they're on the same political team and what is the thing that motivates morris
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:58.000]  dees to become a white savior for the civil rights movement after the civil rights movement ended
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:05.680]  i did a report back in 2014 i called it profits of hate kind of a pun because the southern poverty
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:11.200]  law center is always prophesying about the dire consequences of all these hate groups about the
[1:09:11.200 --> 1:09:16.080]  dire consequences of people exercising their freedom of religion if it comes to christianity
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:21.920]  but it's really not about prophesying of the coming of hatred and violence no it's really
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:29.360]  about profits p-r-o-f-i-t-s dollar signs that's what motivates the southern poverty law center
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:34.720]  and profits and power are what motivate demagogues and the democrat party let's i want to play a
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:39.600]  little bit of a clip for you from this report that i did two years ago called profits i hate about
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:44.240]  the southern poverty law center it's an interesting comparison for the splc to make since it got
[1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:51.040]  its start in the violent racist confrontations of the 60s on may 20th 1961 when a busload of black
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:55.280]  and white freedom riders arrived in Montgomery alabama they were met with what time magazine
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:10:02.480]  described as an idiot club swinging mob of about a hundred and this picture we see splc founder
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:08.000]  morris dees's first client the man on the ground with the camera getting kicked by clansmen uh
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:14.960]  that's not morris dees client this is dees's client dees didn't defend the freedom riders who
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:21.680]  were viciously attacked bloodied and had their bus set on fire dees defended the kkk thug the ring
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:27.680]  leader and he got him off in spite of it being widely reported like this article in life magazine
[1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:33.120]  and morris dees got paid a lot of money five thousand dollars which at the time was the median
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:40.480]  family income for a year but this is what his bio on the splc website says after launching a law
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:46.160]  of practice in montgomery in 1960 he won a series of groundbreaking civil rights cases
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:52.880]  maybe he should amend that to say that he won for the clan a leg-breaking case against civil
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:57.760]  rights activists morris dees would have us believe that sometime after he got clansmen
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:03.040]  claud hindley off sometime after he cashed the check that he decided that he would start
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:08.560]  suing the clan for cash instead of defending the clan for cash maybe it wasn't a moral epiphany
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:13.760]  but a financial epiphany he could make much more money doing direct mail fundraising to the public
[1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:19.920]  than he could suing criticisms of the splc from the left focus on how little it does other than
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:26.160]  fundraising how much money it hoards for its endowment and how much money it pays multimillionaire morris
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:30.080]  dees okay let's hold it right there and if you want to see the rest of that report i'll put that
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:35.280]  out uh you can find it on the alex jones channel it's uh profits of hate that's a couple years old
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:38.480]  so i'll put it up on my twitter account liberty terry and if you want to take a look at that i'll
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:43.440]  do that after the show but you know here's the key in 1996 the usa today called the southern
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:48.160]  poverty law center the nation's richest civil rights organization with a 68 million dollar bank
[1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:54.080]  account at the time i wrote this two years ago their bank account had grown to over 224 million
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:59.920]  so yeah there's a lot of profits and selling hatred and selling division and that's precisely
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:04.160]  what is being orchestrated in this coming week you're going to see this escalating i'm telling you
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:10.480]  this is an orchestrated protest against donald trump it is a narrative that they are creating
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:16.880]  in the run-up to the inauguration one of racism to go along with russia as well but i want to
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:21.200]  take a look at some of the other things that are coming up the inauguration of course we have
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:28.080]  those tolerant people at the council on american islamic relations care now telling donald trump
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:34.480]  that he needs to get rid of franklin graham billy graham's son from the inaugural prayers now he's
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.440]  going to be one of six clergymen who are going to be speaking at the january 20th inauguration
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:44.720]  this is a report from uh wmd they say in a press release issued this week care referred to the
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:51.520]  son of evangelist billy graham as a quote notorious islamophobe and they say reverend graham's ill
[1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:56.720]  formed and extremist views are incompatible with the constitution and with american values of religious
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:04.240]  liberty and inclusion really really no i would say that islam is incompatible with the idea of
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:11.680]  religious liberty and inclusion i would say that islam is incompatible with the idea that we would
[1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:16.640]  have freedom of religion free expression of religion that is protected in the first amendment of the
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:26.000]  constitution do you know of any theological islamic country that is run by mullahs or by sharia law do
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:32.080]  you know of any of those islamic countries that tolerate religious plurality no they don't
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:38.640]  they don't there's not much they tolerate from women from homosexuals from christians they got a
[1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:44.400]  long list of things that they don't tolerate you see when you go into these countries that are run
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:50.160]  like saudi arabia are closest ally that gets so much uh that contributed so much money to
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:56.480]  helary clinton when you look at those countries like saudi arabia what they are doing is the
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:14:02.080]  antithesis of the first amendment they are theocracies sharia law and these countries that
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:08.800]  have mullahs running them are theocracies and that's what american foreign policy has been doing
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:15.920]  overthrowing secular governments secular islamic governments like in syria as in syria to establish
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:24.480]  sharia law to establish caliphates that's what isis is we have been fighting on the side of isis
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:31.760]  arming isis avoiding bombing isis dropping weapons to isis turning over weapons to isis
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.480]  not bombing the convoys of isis trucks whether they're soldiers or whether they're shipping
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:43.120]  oil no we are on the side of those people who are against tolerance the people who are against
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:49.280]  freedom of religion the people who don't want any separation of church and state which by the way
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:55.440]  is not in the constitution but uh the point out in this article of wnd awad was linked to the holy
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:15:00.800]  land foundation this is care now these are the people who say that franklin graham is extremist
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:08.000]  franklin graham should not be allowed to lead a prayer at the inauguration care the council on
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:15.200]  american islamic relations says that uh he should be taken out by donald trump now this guy in particular
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:20.800]  leader who issued this statement as pointed out by wnd was linked to the holy land foundation
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:26.000]  terror funding case by wiretaps it showed him present at a 1993 philadelphia meeting of hamas
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:32.320]  leaders and activists were participants hatched a plot to disguise payments to hamas terrorists
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:37.680]  as 12 million dollars in charitable giving five of the plotters were given substantial
[1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:44.160]  prison sentences and now they want barack obama to give these guys a pardon they so they don't want
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:50.880]  billy graham who spoke out against hatred like this they don't want him to even be able to lead a
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:56.560]  prayer that's the tolerance of the left and when we come back i'm going to tell you how the german

[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:25.200]  they took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened

[1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:15.280]  so
[1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:28.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show this sunday january 15th 2017 i'm david night
[1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:35.120]  i want to get to the story that i i tease at the end of the uh segment um we just had
[1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:41.760]  we've got a german court that says that synagogue torching is okay because it was meant to criticize
[1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:46.480]  israel you know free speech but then at the same time we've now had a coalition from angola merkel
[1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:51.520]  saying we're going to really come after with some heavy penalties anybody who uses hate speech
[1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:57.920]  on social media how's that for a head-wrenching contradiction we're going to talk about that
[1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:03.520]  story in just a moment before we do real quickly i remind you that we have revived the make our
[1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:07.760]  make our bodies great again initiative 2017 again this is the time of year that people
[1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:13.360]  start thinking about their health it's a great time for you to set up healthy habits and to
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:20.800]  help you do that we've put a lot of our supplements on sale from uh 10 for dna force to 30 off for
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:26.240]  brain force supermail vitality and survival shield x2 our nascent iodine but in this segment
[1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:32.640]  since we've been talking about the terrorist event that happened in orlando last year and the
[1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:39.440]  totally inappropriate reaction that john lewis had staging a sit-in demanding gun control
[1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:46.080]  i want to talk a little bit about things that you can do to protect yourself and let's start
[1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:52.880]  by talking about defense because you know we've had several democrat legislators even try to
[1:21:52.880 --> 1:22:00.080]  take away people's ability to passively protect themselves with bulletproof armor with bulletproof
[1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:06.800]  vest and that is something that is coming down the pike folks i don't understand how in the world
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:11.760]  they're going to justify that especially in places like chicago where their policies have
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:16.720]  created gun-free killing zones that place as we pointed out over and over again last week we had
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:23.840]  obama go back to chicago and do his farewell speech and if you look back at his legacy of eight years
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:29.520]  there's been about 4 000 people shot and killed in that place that has the tightest gun control
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:34.720]  of any place in the country why don't we see those kind of casualties in places where people are
[1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:40.000]  allowed to own guns all you and i know the reason the left will not admit it but we know the reason
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.600]  because people can defend themselves and so criminals are always going to have guns and
[1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:49.200]  they're going to go to places where the victims have been disarmed by the state so those are the
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:54.160]  policies that obama has been promoting so to push back against that we're selling body armor we're
[1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:58.080]  even selling 80 percent lowers you know i was just talking to the crew telling them how my
[1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:01.680]  daughter when she came back from china one of the first things we did she was about five years old
[1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:08.640]  when we adopted her we took her to build a bear and we let her build that and uh and and it really
[1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:13.200]  bothered me to see that slogan up there about it takes a village you know they paraphrase hillary
[1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:17.680]  clinton's it takes a village now it doesn't take a village it takes it takes devoted parents
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:22.560]  to raise children to give them the right values it's a very dangerous thing for the government
[1:23:22.560 --> 1:23:26.720]  to raise your children but that's what they always seek to do but in spite of that i looked at that
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:32.400]  and it kind of put me off on that activity but she loved it and now she's uh 15 years old just turn
[1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:40.080]  15 and i think it's time for her to build ar to build an ar that's right uh we've got 80 percent
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:45.200]  lowers that we're selling at info wars store right now this is new special operator tested
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:50.400]  80 percent lowers now available designed patented and produced in tennessee by the respected tennessee
[1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:55.920]  arms manufacturing group there's an unconditional lifetime warranty no questions asked return policy
[1:23:55.920 --> 1:24:01.120]  it uses only marine grade brass this is something that you may not realize it's perfectly legal for
[1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:07.200]  you to build your own gun now may be the time for my little girl to build her and start learning
[1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:13.040]  how to use an ar 15 because they are 15s in spite of what joe biden says that is what you should
[1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:18.560]  be shooting especially if you're a girl and you're having difficulty with strength issues or what
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:22.320]  did we show that picture where they he said no you need a shotgun it's like you know what
[1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:27.520]  you're not used to using shotguns if you don't have a lot of upper body strength an ar 15 allows
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:31.360]  you to shoot without the recoil to shoot more accurately and that's a really important thing
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:35.120]  to do when you're shooting you want to be able to shoot it accurately so now maybe i think is
[1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:39.600]  the time for her to learn how to do that also if you're not going to get a gun to protect yourself
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:44.000]  if you're not going to go that route at least protect yourself from bullets this is something
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:49.760]  that even people in chicago should be allowed to do and we now have a patented form of carbon
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:54.960]  nano tube technology the lightest strongest most flexible flexible body armor on the market
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:25:00.240]  it's only a quarter inch thick but it is field tested to stop the most powerful pistol rounds
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:07.440]  and production waterproof super lightweight made in the usa 20 year warranty you'll find it exclusively
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:12.560]  at info wars store dot com and you can get it anywhere from a vest all the way down to the
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:17.200]  cheapest form which you're seeing right now on the screen which is a rectangular with rounded edges
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:22.880]  rectangular insert you can put that in your backpack you can put that in your kid's backpack
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:28.480]  so they are protected if they have to go to a gunfree killing zone like an airport or school
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:33.200]  that we all have to frequent but that they've taken people's ability to protect themselves
[1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:37.920]  away so until we get that restored be able to protect yourself by having something that will
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:46.880]  stop a bullet reliably now i want to talk about this speech case just absolutely amazing this story
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:52.960]  the german court calls a synagogue torching an act that was designed to criticize israel
[1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:58.880]  so see it's okay you you can shout you you can't shout fire in a crowded theater that's the classic
[1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:05.040]  example right they tell us free speech does not mean that you can shout fire in a crowded theater
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:10.160]  and yet in this particular case this german court says but setting the place on fire is protected
[1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:17.440]  free speech if you want to protest somebody for being jewish okay it is nothing but anti-semitism
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:23.920]  let's call it what it is and actually uh volker beck who is a leading green party member of parliament
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:28.480]  in germany said the attack on the synagogue was motivated by anti-semitism he said what do jews
[1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:33.440]  in germany have to do with the middle east conflict everybody as much as christians
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:40.240]  non-religious people or muslims in germany namely nothing absolutely nothing so he says
[1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:48.480]  the german court here says that it was okay to set this synagogue on fire because it was protesting
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:56.240]  israeli policy against the palette with the vis-a-vis the palestinians uh no he said these
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:01.520]  german jews have nothing to do with that any more than muslims living in germany have to do
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:06.320]  with that policy he said the ignorance of the judiciary towards anti-semitism is for many
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:12.480]  jews in germany especially alarming see this is the problem with hate speech the court looks at
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:17.760]  this and says oh this is an issue of hate speech versus free speech no it's an issue of arson
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:23.200]  it's an issue of arson the court also noted that the men had consumed alcohol and that there were
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:27.760]  no injuries to members of the synagogue so that makes it okay see if you're drunk and you do it
[1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:33.280]  it makes it okay no it doesn't it doesn't make it okay if you're drunk it doesn't make it okay
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:37.920]  if israel did something a foreign government does something and then to say well because
[1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:42.000]  israel did something now we can punish jews in this country and it doesn't make it okay
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:48.480]  that nobody was hurt you see the issue with arson is that you are putting lives at risk
[1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:52.160]  not only the lives of people that might be in the building the lives of people who might be in
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:56.880]  adjacent buildings that might catch fire once you set a fire but you're also putting at risk
[1:27:56.880 --> 1:28:02.960]  the lives of the firemen who have to come and put it out that's why arson is taken so seriously
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:06.960]  and it should be taken seriously but we get back into this thing as to well is it hate speech or
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:11.760]  is it free speech whether no it's just simply arson we can't see the real essence the real crime
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:16.880]  that is at the root of all this and then the most amazing thing of it is that this was clearly
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:25.360]  anti-semitism and they give that a pass and yet what are we told by angela merkel we've got chancellor
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:32.240]  merkel's government this is a story from uh roiders i'm sorry bloomberg saying that of course facebook
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:36.640]  and twitter are going to get massive fines if they don't crack down on social media for hate
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:41.360]  speech now this was hate speech that's at the synagogue on fire the german court says that's
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:46.720]  okay but they're going to do draconian measures for people on the internet where nobody's going to
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:52.800]  get hurt absolutely amazing because that is going to be that was speech that favors the government
[1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:57.280]  policies if a government policy is favored it's not an issue they're going to let that go but if
[1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:01.120]  they don't like what you're saying because you're critical of refugees look out we're selling a product

[1:33:04.640 --> 1:33:07.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:12.240 --> 1:33:17.360]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:25.680]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we were just talking about the amazing
[1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:34.720]  positions taken in germany i'm just speechless here for a moment looking at what merkel is doing
[1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:38.320]  at the same time saying we're going to prosecute hate speech on social media but then you got a
[1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:42.640]  german court saying hey they set fire to a synagogue we're going to let these guys go
[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:48.480]  go because they were protesting Israeli policies and as the green member of parliament said
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:52.640]  these people here at the synagogue have absolutely nothing to do
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:34:00.080]  with Israeli foreign policy this is anti-semitism clear and simple it was hate speech and it was
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:05.760]  also dangerous arson arson is very dangerous but of course you can't yell fire in a crowded theater
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:10.160]  but you can burn the theater down as long as you're protesting israel i guess that's okay
[1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:15.440]  as long as you're doing something political so now we have and of course this is merkel
[1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:20.880]  moving to the next step we saw a couple of years ago actually it was about a year and a half ago
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:27.440]  september 2015 remember that hot mic situation between angla merkel and zuckerberg of facebook
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:30.800]  and she was saying you know what are you going to do to shut down criticism of refugees and
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:34.560]  says we're working on it well maybe they're not working on it fast enough or hard enough for
[1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:39.840]  angla merkel so now they're going to threaten fines that will give them at least justification
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:43.280]  so they'll they'll come out and facebook will say well we had to do this because they were
[1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:47.120]  going to give us fines so we're going to shut down your free speech we're going to shut down
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:52.960]  speech that the government thinks is dangerous because it criticizes their immigration policy
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:59.120]  their open border policy take a look at what this lady is saying this danish journalist
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:04.800]  it's a story on rt today he used new tool against political opponents is to link them to russia
[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:11.760]  you see what they want to do it's not about hate speech it's really about censoring people who
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:16.640]  oppose the government censoring people who oppose globalism and of course the open borders that
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:22.560]  are represented by bringing in massive numbers of muslims who then are allowed to set synagogues
[1:35:22.560 --> 1:35:26.880]  and churches on fire and it's okay because they're just protesters right they're just exercising
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:30.880]  their free speech when they cut the heads off of statues at christian churches they're just
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:34.320]  exercising their free speech when they attack people for being christians when they attack
[1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:39.840]  people for being jewish but of course the government and the eu is attacking people for
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:45.360]  being russian or having links to them if you criticize their policies and that's the point
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:51.600]  that this danish journalist i've been thrown home said it's a lady she's been branded as a
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:58.160]  russian propagandist see that's what our arbiters are our ministry of truth as we've now created
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:05.680]  it and made the state department with endowing it with 160 million dollars over two years it's
[1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:09.200]  going to be our new ministry of truth they're going to identify who the propagandists are
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:13.440]  and then come after them and this is what's happening already in the eu this lady danish
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:19.520]  journalist was branded as a russian propagandist she was included on an eu blacklist a blacklist
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:24.800]  for comments that she made on immigration policy and she tells rt that such character
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:30.320]  assassinations have become the new go-to tactic of western governments she explained her reservations
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:35.520]  about the eu's current migrant policy and an op ed piece that she penned and about its inability
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:41.280]  to properly integrate muslim migrants into european society she's also written a piece for rt
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:46.960]  earlier in which she explained how she said the quote unquote spiritual vacuum that has been
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:54.080]  created by western cultural nihilism western cultural nihilism see that's what we call in america
[1:36:54.080 --> 1:37:01.520]  hollywood that is western cultural nihilism at its core she says western cultural nihilism is a
[1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:07.360]  core factor behind growing muslim radicalization within the eu she says today it is me who is on
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:11.520]  the blacklist tomorrow it could be a different journalist who has similar views they claim
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:17.680]  that i'm damaging that i'm doing harm to the european union just for criticizing them i criticize
[1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:23.520]  them for their immigration policy she said that the way they deal with this is to link the person
[1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:29.280]  with russia see this is what's going to happen with the state department here with their 160 million
[1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:34.480]  dollar grant they're going to link us to russia if we criticize their policy just like they're
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:39.440]  linking donald trump to russia or they're going to claim that such close ties between this person
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:44.640]  in russia then this person is not just trustworthy anymore it's a kind of character assassination
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:51.520]  exactly and then she goes on with this uh meme of western cultural nihilism she says secularism
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:59.520]  relativism of values materialism and democracy as a new religion an ideology an idolatry that's
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:05.760]  devoid of a deity constantly prove that they are feeble and inadequate and adequate when facing
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:12.720]  islamicism this is why care doesn't want franklin graham delete a prayer at the trump inauguration
[1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:17.520]  see the only way that we're going to fight back against the hollywood people who thankfully
[1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:21.280]  are going to be boycotting this who needs them i don't care if they're there i don't care if these
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:27.200]  democrat politicians like john lewis are there who cares if they boycott it who cares if the
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:34.320]  hollywood people who are destroying our culture destroying us spiritually culturally and in every
[1:38:34.320 --> 1:38:38.320]  other way constitutionally who cares if these snowflakes show up you know they just put out
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:42.480]  another video where they say well we're going to survive this we we thought about this we went
[1:38:42.480 --> 1:38:47.040]  into our safe places and we're going to survive the donald trump presidency well let's hope that
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:51.920]  your careers don't because i'm not going to be giving you any money i could care less about
[1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:56.160]  that stuff anymore one of the things that's he's going to have to deal with of course is going to
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:01.520]  be the republican establishment as well as a democrat establishment npr has a an article today
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:07.360]  you know that vow to defund plan parenthood well it's easy to say and it's hard to do so it's easier
[1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:13.760]  to kill a baby than it is to kill the funding of killing a baby that's the bottom line here and of
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:17.600]  course the person who's going to be opposing donald trump on most of this stuff when he doesn't
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:22.960]  oppose him i don't think on um on the abortion issue although paul ryan really hasn't done anything
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:29.280]  has he in the wake of the scandals that we saw where they were getting body parts uh from plan
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:34.960]  parenthood what did paul ryan do nothing and of course paul ryan is somebody who has always been
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:41.840]  on the side of open borders open immigration and he told some people on friday he said gave
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:47.680]  assurances he said quote we are not going to pull the rug out from under undocumented immigrants
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:52.800]  let me translate that for you if you're a foreign citizen that's what they call undocumented
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:57.360]  immigrants if you're a foreign citizen who is here illegally undocumented immigrant in other
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:02.640]  words you're a foreign citizen here illegally and you're demanding benefits you're going to get
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:06.640]  him from paul ryan he's going to make sure that you can stay that you can get all those benefits
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:12.720]  and of course DACA for the dreamers the deferred action for childhood arrivals and that includes
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:18.800]  people up to the age of 31 glenn beck you know these i guess that before you didn't need to go down
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:22.960]  to the border and hand out teddy bears people at eight years old you did not have unaccompanied
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:28.640]  minors making their way across central america and mexico and in the united states border at eight
[1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:32.800]  years old that need if this people need a teddy bear they couldn't have made that journey unaccompanied
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:37.360]  okay so the whole thing is a lie and the fact that they include people up to the age of 31
[1:40:38.240 --> 1:40:43.600]  should tell you something about that and i'll just say that you know the only people that have a
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:47.840]  dream that is respected anymore the people who are americans who have an american dream of owning
[1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:51.840]  a home for example they're going to lose that american dream of owning their home because
[1:40:51.840 --> 1:40:56.640]  they're going to have to pay for the education of any foreign citizen who wants to come here
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:03.920]  and demand an education at our expense because most of our property taxes are most go to playing
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:08.160]  for education and we're going to have to educate these children in whatever language they choose
[1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:12.000]  to be educated at if they come here from china we've got to educate them in chinese if they come
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  here from uh berma then we've got to educate them in whatever dialect they speak so it's not enough
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.840]  that they uh just come here want to be educated in a foreign language we're going to have scores
[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:27.120]  of teachers in some of these districts that speak scores of languages to educate these children
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:33.280]  because heaven forbid that we would ever want to educate them in english because we don't want
[1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:37.200]  them to assimilate that would defeat the whole purpose of open borders if everybody were to
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:42.880]  come together with a common language no we want a tower of babble country we want to divide people
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:47.840]  we want to keep them divided and we want to bring in a replacement population to replace this culture
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:53.200]  now on other issues we also see ryan gearing up to oppose donald trump here's one donald trump says
[1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:58.320]  he wants a buy america form policy he says my administration will follow two simple rules we'll
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:03.280]  buy american and hire americans right we're going to do it said donald trump he said that with his
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:08.880]  thank you tour rallies in december but at the same time we've got people like paul ryan saying uh no
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:15.200]  we're not going to do that and the very first thing that they did was in an infrastructure bill
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:22.880]  that had a buy american uh clause in it they shut that down they shut that down and a democrat
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:26.880]  senator called him on it she said their position against buy america is at stark odds with the
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:31.360]  president elect who has repeatedly pledged two rules for rebuilding the nation's infrastructure
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:37.840]  buy american and hire american and they're not doing it that's paul ryan the same guy who says that
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:44.320]  a ban on lobbying would be bad we don't want to stop lobbyists okay that would be dangerous to the
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:51.040]  political establishment uh this is the guy that is going to be the chief opposition to donald trump
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:55.760]  paul ryan stay stay with us we're going to be right back with alex jones he has a special report
[1:42:55.760 --> 1:43:02.400]  right after the break yesterday the senate took the first step towards repealing the
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:06.960]  affordable care act with a 51 to 48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to
[1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:11.600]  gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is obama care without allowing democrats to filibuster
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:16.000]  liberal tears float heavy as the senate had to be called in order every time a democrat voted no
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  with a nice lecture to go with it forcing the providing officer senator quarry gardener to
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:24.560]  slam his gavel and scold the democrats repeating at nauseam debate is not allowed during a vote
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:28.320]  now today the vote moves on to the house where we have had similar results the debate has been
[1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:32.240]  heated with democrats speaking past their time bringing in large blown up photos of children
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:36.560]  to win sympathy points and try to argue that republicans are ending health care like before
[1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:40.640]  the affordable care act right senator hekeem jeffreys claims that voting against the affordable
[1:43:40.640 --> 1:43:45.200]  care act sets up americans to be screwed by big wigs and fat cats in the health care industry
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:49.520]  ignoring the fact that this is what the affordable care act did creating health care monopolies in
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:54.000]  some regions he also said that republicans had no plan to which republicans responded by showing
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:58.800]  the many plans they brought to the debate floor this is owens shroyer and i've got jugs of liberal

[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:53.360]  finally today i want to just talk about the climate we're all living in
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:59.040]  people ask me continually alex are you for real do you really get this excited
[1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:04.880]  how do you do it without drugs why do you have so much energy and the answer is
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:13.520]  i'm passionate now i do tend to sometimes let myself get impassioned because i genuinely feel
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:22.160]  that way but i as i've described it let the dog off the leash and blow up on air or engage in one
[1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:28.000]  of the rants that are that are so popular for what what reason i'm not sure sometimes but i
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:32.800]  guess in a nation of people that are unconscious and basically suffering from a form of zombie
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:39.280]  osis uh it's effective so we can't argue with it but lately i've been so excited that even though
[1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:43.440]  i'm sitting here at a desk with a list of notes in front of me and i've eloquently thought all
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:50.960]  this out in my mind i quite frankly cannot help but start hyperventilating when i try to talk
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:49:00.160]  about just how huge and positive these developments are it is such a big deal that after 50 years of
[1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:05.600]  the global government project being built in stealth and the elites denying it denying it denying it
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:12.560]  that patriots like red beckman you know 50 something years ago and ronald reagan for that
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:18.560]  matter and and and people like berry goldwater that fought so hard to expose what was going on
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:23.520]  and to speak out it got laughed at and got bullied and got demonized by the mainstream media back
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:29.200]  when there was basically no broadcast media radio or tv to challenge them only underground
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:34.880]  newsletters and books so imagine the nightly news back then had like 20 million viewers per channel
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:41.280]  so you're talking about 2050 60 a hundred million people watching mainstream news and lies every
[1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:48.800]  night versus berry goldwater writing a couple books i mean it was really really really hard
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:54.560]  to counter them but by the mid 1970s there were books out there like none there call a conspiracy
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.680]  by gary allen whose son now runs politico would have disgraced how he's turned his back on america
[1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:05.680]  but that's a sad issue that sold over 10 million copies some some say it's like 20 million now but
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:13.360]  it was confirmed 10 million back in the 70s and just the fact that sure they had five six seven
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:18.800]  times the viewers every night of what that one book did in a few years but because the truth was so
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:25.120]  strong and exposed the entire blueprint of the operation that book is what they call evergreen
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:30.400]  and it sent shockwaves ripples throughout the pond that are now devastating the new world order
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:36.960]  and now think about what the globalists have to face where we have tens of millions of visitors
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:42.320]  to info wars every day when we have tens of millions of people that tune in conservatively
[1:50:42.320 --> 1:50:48.880]  every week tens of millions that watch us on youtube every week alone again that's not bragging
[1:50:48.880 --> 1:50:56.320]  that's telling you the success we've all had together and now global government is collapsing
[1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:02.080]  they're having to admit its global government so it chills right now they're having to admit
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:06.240]  the communist chinese are at the heart of it and that a deal was made with them in the 70s to take
