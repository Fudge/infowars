[00:00.000 --> 00:09.920]  How long can you apologize for tyranny before the apologies are worthless?
[00:09.920 --> 00:10.920]  I failed.
[00:10.920 --> 00:15.720]  Denver Mayor Michael Hancock admits his decision to fly to Mississippi to be with his daughter
[00:15.720 --> 00:20.480]  for Thanksgiving, even as he urged everyone else to stay home, was hypocritical.
[00:20.480 --> 00:23.080]  It's a mistake that I deeply regret.
[00:23.080 --> 00:24.480]  It made a mistake.
[00:24.480 --> 00:25.480]  I apologize.
[00:25.480 --> 00:30.600]  California Governor Gavin Newsom apologized on Monday for flouting his own coronavirus
[00:30.600 --> 00:32.320]  guidelines.
[00:32.320 --> 00:34.320]  And I made a bad mistake.
[00:34.320 --> 00:39.400]  Instead of sitting down, I should have stood up.
[00:39.400 --> 00:45.440]  I made a mistake and I own it, and I certainly should have been more astute about the specifics
[00:45.440 --> 00:46.440]  of the regulations.
[00:46.440 --> 00:51.680]  I knew that there were advisories and I simply should have been more astute to it.
[00:51.680 --> 00:56.760]  And after the apology dissipates into the ether, jump right back on your totalitarian
[00:56.760 --> 01:00.120]  horse and keep gaslighting the American people.
[01:00.120 --> 01:01.880]  Good evening Los Angeles.
[01:01.880 --> 01:03.960]  My message couldn't be simpler.
[01:03.960 --> 01:05.960]  It's time to hunker down.
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.600]  It's time to cancel everything, and if it isn't essential, don't do it.
[01:11.600 --> 01:17.280]  Case in point, Austin Texas Mayor Steve Adler recently made an international fool out of
[01:17.280 --> 01:18.280]  himself.
[01:18.280 --> 01:21.200]  I'm sorry I took that trip.
[01:21.200 --> 01:27.840]  It was a lapse in judgment, and I want you to know that I apologize.
[01:27.840 --> 01:32.440]  Austin Mayor Steve Adler is apologizing tonight for traveling to Mexico with a group of family
[01:32.440 --> 01:36.840]  and friends last month, despite urging Austinites to stay home.
[01:36.840 --> 01:39.760]  I think it's a leader, right?
[01:39.760 --> 01:43.120]  You have to live what you're directing people to do.
[01:43.120 --> 01:47.480]  Night was in a webinar with Adler when news first broke of his trip to Mexico.
[01:47.480 --> 01:51.720]  He said he has supported family units dining out like when his daughter got married.
[01:51.720 --> 01:52.720]  And Joe?
[01:52.720 --> 01:55.520]  I'm about to spend the next 24 hours defending that.
[01:55.520 --> 02:01.080]  24 hours later, his lame excuse of an apology had been tossed in the liberal dustbin of
[02:01.080 --> 02:06.880]  hubris history as he went back to his far-left critique of reality, quickly responding to
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.640]  Texas Governor Abbott's growing move to place law enforcement under the control of the state
[02:12.640 --> 02:18.200]  after homicide rates have risen to the highest level in Austin, Texas in over two decades.
[02:18.200 --> 02:22.760]  Adler tweeted, this would be unprecedented, commandeering of local law enforcement.
[02:22.760 --> 02:28.600]  Our state has serious challenges with too many uninsured, inadequate funding for education
[02:28.600 --> 02:31.320]  and an insufficient pandemic response.
[02:31.320 --> 02:33.580]  They need to be our focus.
[02:33.580 --> 02:38.920]  Responding to Adler's lunacy, the Austin Police Association dropped the hammer on Adler's
[02:38.920 --> 02:45.520]  ignorance, stating, unprecedented was your action to eliminate 150 officer positions,
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.400]  cancel cadet classes, cut police funding, leave potential new hires stranded in Austin
[02:51.400 --> 02:57.440]  without medical insurance, adding to the uninsured roles, look in the mirror and take focus.
[02:57.440 --> 03:02.640]  Some Austinites who are out early today collecting signatures to recall Austin Mayor Steve Adler.
[03:02.640 --> 03:05.440]  It happened in early voting locations in town.
[03:05.440 --> 03:12.080]  Now that he went to Mexico, and has proven that maybe this virus isn't really serious
[03:12.080 --> 03:17.640]  as it's cracked up to be, because he put his family and the citizens here in Austin in
[03:17.640 --> 03:18.640]  danger by doing that.
[03:18.640 --> 03:26.640]  Well, if you go back running, hiding like chicken noodle, Big Tech's puppet, Mayor Adler laughs
[03:26.640 --> 03:27.640]  at you.
[03:27.640 --> 03:32.600]  Mayor Adler lies around on Big Tech paid for private jets.
[03:32.600 --> 03:39.040]  The local level petty tyrants are merely mirroring the greater tyranny occupying Congress.
[03:39.040 --> 03:44.280]  The House just agreed to have the shortest work year in U.S. history in 2021.
[03:44.280 --> 03:48.360]  It'll probably become the laziest Congress we have ever had.
[03:48.360 --> 03:54.200]  While Speaker Nancy Pelosi openly and arrogantly revealed that she led the House on a political
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.120]  goose chase when it came to the COVID relief stimulus that would have saved thousands of
[03:59.120 --> 04:05.280]  lives due to suicide and come to the aid of small businesses closing all over America.
[04:05.280 --> 04:12.800]  That is a total game changer, a new president and a vaccine.
[04:12.800 --> 04:19.520]  So there's nothing to, these are different, but what was then before was not more of this.
[04:19.520 --> 04:22.040]  This has simplicity.
[04:22.040 --> 04:24.560]  It's what we've had in our bills.
[04:24.560 --> 04:30.360]  It's for a shorter period of time, but that's okay now because we have a new president.
[04:30.360 --> 04:34.440]  They don't have to accept half a vote months ago when you said, I'm not going to accept
[04:34.440 --> 04:35.440]  half a vote.
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.440]  I'm going to take something.
[04:36.440 --> 04:42.040]  Don't characterize what we did before as a mistake, as a preface to your question if
[04:42.040 --> 04:43.400]  you want an answer.
[04:43.400 --> 04:49.600]  Our government is folding in on itself as absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[04:49.600 --> 04:59.000]  John Bowen reporting.
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.000]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the communist
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.320]  Chinese and the United Nations.
[05:06.320 --> 05:11.720]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models
[05:11.720 --> 05:15.800]  of complete lockdowns, you can't even leave your house for months and months are being
[05:15.800 --> 05:21.280]  announced and in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to
[05:21.280 --> 05:25.760]  blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put
[05:25.760 --> 05:26.760]  them under her control.
[05:26.760 --> 05:27.760]  That's right.
[05:27.760 --> 05:32.560]  She's been ringing elections for years and years and the same thing is coming here to
[05:32.560 --> 05:33.560]  the United States.
[05:33.560 --> 05:34.560]  This is world government.
[05:34.560 --> 05:39.640]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[05:39.640 --> 05:41.720]  They're announcing the Christmas is canceled.
[05:41.720 --> 05:46.120]  This is what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due
[05:46.120 --> 05:51.720]  process, and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[05:51.720 --> 05:54.920]  How long have we warned you about this, but you can fight back.
[05:54.920 --> 05:57.120]  America is the last bastion.
[05:57.120 --> 06:25.960]  Stop submitting a week from now, Mr. President, the electors will meet to cast their vote.
[06:25.960 --> 06:31.280]  There's not a lot of time between now and then to make your case to overturn the vote.
[06:31.280 --> 06:37.320]  At this point, are you looking to change the outcome of the election or try to make a case
[06:37.320 --> 06:39.280]  the American people that it wasn't fair?
[06:39.280 --> 06:41.320]  Well, I think the case has already been made.
[06:41.320 --> 06:44.560]  If you look at the polls, it was a rigged election.
[06:44.560 --> 06:48.240]  You look at the different states, the election was totally rigged.
[06:48.240 --> 06:49.520]  It's a disgrace to our country.
[06:49.520 --> 06:51.080]  It's like a third world country.
[06:51.080 --> 06:56.000]  These ballots pouring in from everywhere, using machinery that nobody knows ownership,
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.240]  nobody knows anything about.
[06:57.240 --> 07:01.760]  They have glitches as they call them glitches, the glitches who aren't glitches, they got
[07:01.760 --> 07:07.400]  caught sending out thousands of votes, all against me, by the way.
[07:07.400 --> 07:11.520]  This was like from a third world nation, and I think the case has been made, and now we
[07:11.520 --> 07:14.920]  find out what we can do about it, but you'll see a lot of big things happening over the
[07:14.920 --> 07:17.120]  next couple of days.
[07:17.120 --> 07:22.840]  You know, the Democrats in the globalist deep state, they tell us that, even Bill Nye,
[07:22.840 --> 07:27.880]  the science guy, says there are not chromosomes to make you male or female, he says that that's
[07:27.880 --> 07:28.880]  not true.
[07:28.880 --> 07:32.960]  They actually went back and edited old 1980s videos he did, and they now re-dubbed them
[07:32.960 --> 07:36.320]  saying that chromosomes do not affect whether you're male or female.
[07:36.320 --> 07:42.200]  Now, that's like saying that H2O isn't made up of two different types of molecules, two
[07:42.200 --> 07:46.800]  different types of atoms.
[07:46.800 --> 07:48.800]  This is insane.
[07:48.800 --> 07:56.320]  It's like saying the sun isn't hot or that green isn't green, but they just keep telling
[07:56.320 --> 08:06.000]  you Biden is the president-elect, Biden is the president-elect, Biden is, Biden is, Biden
[08:06.000 --> 08:12.920]  is, but Al Gore challenged it for 37 days.
[08:12.920 --> 08:18.480]  We're coming up on what happened at the Supreme Court with Al Gore at the same timing.
[08:18.480 --> 08:23.600]  Al Gore got caught with fraud.
[08:23.600 --> 08:25.760]  Al Gore got some of his votes thrown out.
[08:25.760 --> 08:26.760]  We all know what happened.
[08:26.760 --> 08:32.880]  Well, in this case, it's far bigger, it's far more out of control, and we have in places
[08:32.880 --> 08:44.000]  like Georgia from the beginning straight through everything laid out crystal clear, the Democratic
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.600]  Party operatives changing the law without having the legislature change the law, that
[08:49.600 --> 08:51.440]  throws it out.
[08:51.440 --> 08:56.760]  Just making agreements with governors and others to do it in those key states, then mailing
[08:56.760 --> 09:04.480]  out the tens of millions of fake ballots that under law are illegal to random names generated
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.840]  by big tech computer programs, that's illegal, that's unconstitutional.
[09:09.840 --> 09:15.880]  And then you've got the suitcases and the boxes being brought in at 1 a.m., 4 a.m. in
[09:15.880 --> 09:25.960]  Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania and kicking everybody out, throwing everyone out.
[09:25.960 --> 09:32.120]  And then you have the surveillance footage of them going into just mad energy, like they
[09:32.120 --> 09:33.120]  were robbing a bank.
[09:33.120 --> 09:41.480]  Suddenly, they just up their energy and they're cheering, new video, woo, as Biden goes ahead.
[09:41.480 --> 09:50.720]  Grabbing suitcases under tables with blankets covering it up and then sticking them in there
[09:50.720 --> 09:58.720]  and then they're all Democrat operatives and it goes on and on and on and then magically
[09:58.720 --> 10:06.040]  the biggest spike of the day over Biden, exactly as they're fed to the machines, doesn't get
[10:06.040 --> 10:07.440]  more disgusting than that, does it?
[10:07.440 --> 10:13.760]  Well, actually, more evidence has come out, more damning evidence, and guess who orchestrated
[10:13.760 --> 10:17.840]  these people and guess who they report to, Hillary Clinton's main lawyer, the one that
[10:17.840 --> 10:26.280]  met with the governor and met with the other state officials, turns out he was in direct
[10:26.280 --> 10:32.960]  contact, it's now coming out with these individuals.
[10:32.960 --> 10:36.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the same graph in Michigan, it's the same graph in Pennsylvania,
[10:36.920 --> 10:43.560]  it's the same graph in Georgia just different times, happened at one place at 1 a.m., another
[10:43.560 --> 10:55.280]  place at 2 a.m., another place at 4 a.m., happened at 2 a.m. out in Arizona, caught absolutely
[10:55.280 --> 11:00.840]  red-handed and the Cavalry's here, Texas, Seuss, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and
[11:00.840 --> 11:10.040]  Wisconsin at U.S. Supreme Court over election fraud and they lay it out crisp and clear that
[11:10.040 --> 11:14.800]  they changed the law in those states without the legislature, that's not a law at all.
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.600]  Just because you met with the Democrats and the state official has agreed to it, because
[11:18.600 --> 11:22.320]  they'd be protected and they'd win, they'd be passed over.
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.800]  And then number two, that they mailed out 80 million fake ballots, the violate law,
[11:26.800 --> 11:32.400]  they link all that in here and then all the fraud that was caught on video and in almost
[11:32.400 --> 11:38.520]  every case, every vote was flipped from Trump to Biden when they find the glitches, oh the
[11:38.520 --> 11:48.200]  glitches all over the country, we're against Trump, I mean, come on people.
[11:48.200 --> 11:57.200]  They are caught absolutely red-handed, this is an amazing, amazing time.
[11:57.200 --> 12:04.280]  I've been going on hikes again, I'm getting a little fat and there's so much pollen in
[12:04.280 --> 12:09.680]  the air when I go on a morning hike, it's a little scratchy and I forget my lung cleanse,
[12:09.680 --> 12:13.560]  they cleaned off my desk, well somebody get me a bottle of lung cleanse please, oh that's
[12:13.560 --> 12:18.760]  not an advertisement even though I do sell it, you can go to the store and get a spray
[12:18.760 --> 12:22.840]  that soothes your larynx and soothes your throat, it'll have maybe a little bit of this
[12:22.840 --> 12:28.280]  essential, a little bit of that, some menthol and some alcohol and it works pretty good.
[12:28.280 --> 12:34.280]  Nothing compared to lung cleanse because it's so thick though, sometimes you've got to wash
[12:34.280 --> 12:38.800]  out with hot water, the spray nozzle because we haven't used it in a couple days or a week,
[12:38.800 --> 12:45.120]  it hardens in there because it's like molasses in there, no fillers, more than 10 essential
[12:45.120 --> 12:51.480]  oils, I've got to buy my bedside and if I don't remember to do it, I wake up at like
[12:51.480 --> 12:56.480]  3 a.m. with a dry throat coughing, if I just take four or five shots then everything's
[12:56.480 --> 13:03.320]  happy time, well last night I just hit the bed, didn't do it and then I forgot to do
[13:03.320 --> 13:06.520]  it this morning to go ahead and bring it on over and or I'm going to have to go off
[13:06.520 --> 13:13.120]  here, thanks, oh we don't have any, alright, well that's just how it is then, so there's
[13:13.120 --> 13:26.320]  just so much craziness going on and unfolding in the world, thank you, oh so good, thank
[13:26.320 --> 13:33.680]  you for that, wow, feels like there's ants or something crawling around on my throat
[13:33.680 --> 13:40.200]  and my larynx until I get that essential oil on there, talk about an itch you can't scratch,
[13:40.200 --> 13:43.400]  so what's going to happen is I'm going to restart the transmission, already covered
[13:43.400 --> 13:47.720]  huge bombshell nose the last eight minutes, but we come back from break, going to break
[13:47.720 --> 13:55.280]  in a few minutes, I'm going to really try to be judicious and just hit the basics of
[13:55.280 --> 14:00.640]  these seven or eight big stacks here that are all just unbelievable, I mean the world
[14:00.640 --> 14:06.120]  is so riveting, things are so incredibly important and things are moving so fast that
[14:06.120 --> 14:13.520]  we're seeing more movement on the battlefield of ideas and culture and religion and spirituality
[14:13.520 --> 14:19.920]  and physicality than you would see in five years previous, I mean it's all happening
[14:19.920 --> 14:31.080]  now, this is the big battle and it's not even gotten close to its crescendo or its finale,
[14:31.080 --> 14:35.440]  I mean the news I've got, we already knew this, but now they admit they've been injecting
[14:35.440 --> 14:42.240]  Chinese troops with mRNA vaccines to make them super soldiers, of course that's just
[14:42.240 --> 14:47.080]  a cover for doing secret testing on their poor troops, but at least they get something
[14:47.080 --> 14:54.200]  to make them healthier, we get one to sterilize this and Dr. Francis Boyle is a major professor,
[14:54.200 --> 14:59.480]  he wrote the US biological weapons law, he helped write the UN World Treaty, he's represented
[14:59.480 --> 15:07.560]  world leaders in the Hague, he prosecuted Slovak Miložovic, I mean he's a heavy hitter, okay
[15:07.560 --> 15:11.360]  and he has been dead on before anybody about COVID-19 and where it came from and what really
[15:11.360 --> 15:14.960]  happened, well he wants to come on, we've been trying to get him on for weeks, he's
[15:14.960 --> 15:21.600]  been researching, he says I'm ready, we can show you the headline for today's show, but
[15:21.600 --> 15:35.960]  it is confirmed, author of US biological weapons law says Pfizer's mRNA vaccine is a bio weapon,
[15:35.960 --> 15:49.040]  is a bio weapon and a steroid, now I suggest you tune in and I suggest you listen to this
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.000]  because they're going to hide it in plain view what it does, wait till we lay out what
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.760]  it does, he's confirmed Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg's analysis, the great reset, where have I heard
[15:58.760 --> 16:05.160]  of that before, oh the great leap forward, a mouthful ton, ordering all the small towns
[16:05.160 --> 16:09.800]  and small farms to basically shut down and have the rural people and the small business
[16:09.800 --> 16:14.800]  people move into the big cities and go under communist, commune control and that's all
[16:14.800 --> 16:17.960]  this is, the big mega banks want to break us into the same ones that put Mao Zedang
[16:17.960 --> 16:21.840]  into power and they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy and the
[16:21.840 --> 16:26.880]  new economy where everything's free because when you're a president, well everything's
[16:26.880 --> 16:31.440]  free but you're also a slave, Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes
[16:31.440 --> 16:35.560]  now of subsistence level but of course you've got to take those vaccines, you can't have
[16:35.560 --> 16:41.160]  any kids and oh don't worry though, all of the tampons and stuff like that's free too
[16:41.160 --> 16:46.200]  as well, I'm not kidding, so give me some free paper, give me enough money to basically
[16:46.200 --> 16:50.520]  live in a tiny apartment but they own you, they control you, that's the great reset,
[16:50.520 --> 16:55.160]  that's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're biting it at infowars.com
[16:55.160 --> 17:04.120]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year, just wait until you see the year 2021.
[17:04.120 --> 17:08.680]  I'm Alex Jones, I started info wars but I couldn't have done any of this without you
[17:08.680 --> 17:13.320]  and now info wars is more important than ever because the general population of the planet
[17:13.320 --> 17:17.000]  is weighing up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on, that's why
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  it's so important for those of you out there that have supported the broadcast and the
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.280]  websites and the films and all the rest of the information we put out to realize how
[17:25.280 --> 17:28.640]  important your work has been and to redouble your efforts, so I salute you and I thank
[17:28.640 --> 17:29.640]  you.

[17:55.120 --> 17:59.680]  and God Bless.
[17:59.680 --> 18:13.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:13.840 --> 18:43.120]  All right, we are back live.
[18:43.120 --> 18:48.560]  You know, I tend to play classical Christian Christmas music, like a little drummer board,
[18:48.560 --> 18:54.360]  but the little drummer boy doesn't trigger the left as much as just good old fashioned
[18:54.360 --> 18:56.000]  Christmas fun with the family.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.200]  That's what they're trying to break up.
[18:58.200 --> 18:59.600]  That's what they're trying to block.
[18:59.600 --> 19:01.560]  They want to destroy the family.
[19:01.560 --> 19:04.400]  They want to destroy humans having fun together.
[19:04.400 --> 19:09.480]  They want you isolated in your home under their control, not having barbecues, not playing
[19:09.480 --> 19:14.840]  basketball, not playing football, not playing pool, not doing anything.
[19:14.840 --> 19:18.560]  They want you under their surveillance, under their control and they admit that in their
[19:18.560 --> 19:20.060]  own white papers.
[19:20.060 --> 19:22.040]  We've covered it in Osium.
[19:22.040 --> 19:24.840]  Again, I am your host Alex Jones.
[19:24.840 --> 19:39.120]  We have Dr. Francis Boyle joining us at the bottom of the next hour to confirm that the
[19:39.120 --> 19:45.480]  Pfizer mRNA vaccine is a bio weapon.
[19:45.480 --> 19:46.920]  It is not a vaccine.
[19:46.920 --> 19:54.760]  It doesn't have an attenuated flu or other virus, so your body learns how to beat it.
[19:54.760 --> 20:06.280]  No, it is a genetic recoding mutagen.
[20:06.280 --> 20:12.520]  Mutagen just means making your body's cells do something they're not supposed to do.
[20:12.520 --> 20:18.480]  And you know, radiation will do it, toxic waste will do it, you get out the sun long
[20:18.480 --> 20:21.920]  enough in your life, your cells will mutate, you'll get skin cancer.
[20:21.920 --> 20:26.960]  This is a mutagenic attack.
[20:26.960 --> 20:28.920]  It is not a vaccine.
[20:28.920 --> 20:35.520]  It is a reprogramming drug, nanotech.
[20:35.520 --> 20:39.280]  Boy, snopes and those criminals are going over time right now.
[20:39.280 --> 20:40.280]  Look at these headlines.
[20:40.280 --> 20:48.280]  Snopes, former Pfizer VP did not say COVID vaccine causes female sterilization, that
[20:48.280 --> 20:51.240]  it only is possible.
[20:51.240 --> 20:52.240]  So they call it false.
[20:52.240 --> 20:57.600]  They go, well, you know, the head advisor to the EU did say that it attacks the same
[20:57.600 --> 21:01.680]  protein as the placenta and would probably cause an autoimmune response, but that doesn't
[21:01.680 --> 21:04.000]  mean it'll sterilize you.
[21:04.000 --> 21:15.680]  It looks like saying, you know, if I put a 357 magnum round shell into a revolver and
[21:15.680 --> 21:19.760]  shoot you with it, well, if I shoot you in the leg, you might live.
[21:19.760 --> 21:23.120]  We don't hit the ephemeral artery, but if I shoot you right between the eyes, you probably
[21:23.120 --> 21:24.120]  will die.
[21:24.120 --> 21:28.720]  But you know, snopes is verdict is being shot in the head with 357 magnum at point-blank
[21:28.720 --> 21:29.720]  range.
[21:29.720 --> 21:30.880]  The claim is it'll kill you.
[21:30.880 --> 21:35.360]  Everybody find it false because 3% of the time you might live.
[21:35.360 --> 21:37.120]  It's all games, folks.
[21:37.120 --> 21:39.480]  It's all how they define it.
[21:39.480 --> 21:44.800]  And again, why did Wolfgang Wudarg and the Pfizer chief science officer and all these
[21:44.800 --> 21:48.400]  other medical doctors have come out and said, we've looked at this.
[21:48.400 --> 21:49.640]  This is crazy.
[21:49.640 --> 21:56.320]  This attacks a common protein in your body and will cause a cytokine storm that will
[21:56.320 --> 21:58.880]  kill you.
[21:58.880 --> 22:07.320]  And if you survive it, it will eat your placenta, which again is the uterus connecting with
[22:07.320 --> 22:13.240]  his eye goat, the mother and the baby unifying to create the new life form.
[22:13.240 --> 22:18.760]  It's created upon inception, but to nurture it and to bring it to term.
[22:18.760 --> 22:23.120]  I mean, man, I am having dreams like I've never had.
[22:23.120 --> 22:29.840]  I have dreams from the time I go to sleep, from the time I wake up, intense dreams, total
[22:29.840 --> 22:31.240]  data download.
[22:31.240 --> 22:33.920]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[22:33.920 --> 22:36.880]  It's like a lifetime every time I go to sleep.
[22:36.880 --> 22:42.840]  In fact, it's like this world is not even where I live.
[22:42.840 --> 22:54.800]  Last night was like a hundred years long, indescribable.
[22:54.800 --> 22:57.680]  And everybody else feels it.
[22:57.680 --> 23:00.680]  Everybody else sees it.
[23:00.680 --> 23:06.480]  It's a totally insane time to be alive.
[23:06.480 --> 23:08.520]  It's a quickening.
[23:08.520 --> 23:18.600]  People is making its move upon humanity with nanotech genetic engineered material that
[23:18.600 --> 23:24.240]  reprograms every active cell in your body.
[23:24.240 --> 23:29.360]  And by that, the eyes are the cells you get.
[23:29.360 --> 23:37.160]  And there's a few other things like ovaries in a woman when she's born after nine months
[23:37.160 --> 23:44.400]  and her mother, she has the same ovaries she'll have when she's 120.
[23:44.400 --> 23:57.400]  So there are eye tissue and ovaries, the eggs are what you got.
[23:57.400 --> 24:03.840]  All the other cells basically are replicating and replacing themselves.
[24:03.840 --> 24:09.440]  The brain to a lesser extent, but some of it doesn't replicate.
[24:09.440 --> 24:15.120]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:15.120 --> 24:23.720]  They are putting into almost every cell in your body a program and then they've done
[24:23.720 --> 24:28.880]  animal trials on mRNA for 20 years, folks, and it kills so many of the animals.
[24:28.880 --> 24:30.720]  And here's what happens.
[24:30.720 --> 24:38.000]  Look, this is a giant experiment and there's a bunch of attacks going on, but here's the
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.440]  best we know.
[24:42.440 --> 24:48.920]  This is going to give everyone that takes it a very good chance, depending on the literature,
[24:48.920 --> 24:55.760]  50 to 70% chance of developing an allergy to the coronavirus family, the most common
[24:55.760 --> 24:58.960]  virus on earth.
[24:58.960 --> 25:01.840]  Which our cells produce themselves, that's confirmed.
[25:01.840 --> 25:06.080]  They just argue that a virus made us replicate it, but a lot of scientists know we're actually
[25:06.080 --> 25:10.600]  disgorging toxins through this and that's another school of thought.
[25:10.600 --> 25:17.480]  But the point is, is that they are going to go into you and teach your body to attack
[25:17.480 --> 25:20.440]  coronaviruses.
[25:20.440 --> 25:29.960]  But most people in the studies, very limited, very accelerated, create a passive antibody,
[25:29.960 --> 25:32.960]  meaning it doesn't do anything.
[25:32.960 --> 25:40.800]  You're like, well, okay, it's a simple sebo, Bill Gates just makes money, oh no, no, no.
[25:40.800 --> 25:48.840]  Once you have passive antibodies attached to your cells, junk, when your body comes
[25:48.840 --> 25:53.640]  across something similar again, it has an autoimmune response.
[25:53.640 --> 25:55.400]  That's what happens with bees.
[25:55.400 --> 25:56.400]  This is from scientists.
[25:56.400 --> 25:59.840]  I'm not an allergist, I'm not a scientist, I read the literature.
[25:59.840 --> 26:05.480]  You get stung a few times by bees, your body hasn't developed, I mean, I used to get stung
[26:05.480 --> 26:09.840]  out playing football or we used to fight them with ping pong paddles and we'd go to a barn
[26:09.840 --> 26:13.680]  with yellow jackets and stir them up and then fight them with ping pong paddles.
[26:13.680 --> 26:20.120]  Those four video games were so exciting as they are now and again, I never had an allergic
[26:20.120 --> 26:27.960]  response until I was plowing my parents' yard for their garden at a new house they had
[26:27.960 --> 26:33.160]  and I got attacked by a bunch of bees, probably stung 15, 20 times, swole up, couldn't breathe,
[26:33.160 --> 26:40.000]  almost called 911, didn't, took Benadryl and that was when my body finally had gotten the
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.800]  passive antibodies and then the next time I got hit by a bunch of bees I was like, whoa,
[26:44.800 --> 26:46.920]  we don't like this, they're almost killed me.
[26:46.920 --> 26:47.920]  That's the same deal.
[26:47.920 --> 26:48.920]  They're going to do it to everybody.
[26:48.920 --> 26:50.640]  I mean, this is so cold-blooded and sterilizing.
[26:50.640 --> 26:55.800]  I mean, you know, this isn't here, folks, this is here, they're right back.
[26:55.800 --> 27:01.160]  The globalists and their minions want to play God, Chucky Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack
[27:01.160 --> 27:02.160]  Obama.
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.680]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[27:06.680 --> 27:15.240]  Why do they love death because they hate themselves, they project their own disgust with their soul
[27:15.240 --> 27:20.680]  onto us and once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is
[27:20.680 --> 27:21.680]  completely clear.
[27:21.680 --> 27:23.920]  That's why they hate info wars.
[27:23.920 --> 27:25.040]  We believe in humanity.
[27:25.040 --> 27:26.280]  We think you're beautiful.
[27:26.280 --> 27:28.080]  We think you're amazing.
[27:28.080 --> 27:33.160]  Info wars knows you're falling but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[27:33.160 --> 27:36.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here, it's now upon us.
[27:36.840 --> 27:40.080]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever when
[27:40.080 --> 27:43.120]  the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[27:43.120 --> 27:44.680]  We know you're going to override these globalists.
[27:44.680 --> 27:45.680]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[27:45.680 --> 27:49.760]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done because God's
[27:49.760 --> 27:55.560]  on our side and the globalists know it.
[27:55.560 --> 28:00.760]  Imagine a dystopic non-forward dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold,
[28:00.760 --> 28:06.040]  you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly annoculated
[28:06.040 --> 28:11.040]  with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[28:11.040 --> 28:14.880]  That's where you are in the year 2020, global government, the United Nations.
[28:14.880 --> 28:18.760]  All of the authoritarian groups admit they're doing it, they even admit that they're doing
[28:18.760 --> 28:24.480]  it for power and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19.
[28:24.480 --> 28:28.440]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said, thinking about how insane that is.
[28:28.440 --> 28:31.880]  Big tech's got to track you, they've got to trace you, they've got to control you.
[28:31.880 --> 28:35.680]  You've got to have absolutely your house wiped, you've got to have secret police come
[28:35.680 --> 28:40.360]  disappear you because, my God, this thing has one tenth of one percent chance of killing
[28:40.360 --> 28:44.520]  you, giving you your ability to have cancer or heart attack.
[28:44.520 --> 28:46.440]  This is their takeover.
[28:46.440 --> 28:50.440]  Imagine on America's dystopic, killed by the fear of the common cold.
[28:50.440 --> 29:05.600]  Yeah, that's fear mongering, that's mind control.
[29:05.600 --> 29:10.080]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.440]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[29:13.440 --> 29:16.720]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[29:16.720 --> 29:20.200]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[29:20.200 --> 29:22.280]  People then ask you to name the app.
[29:22.280 --> 29:24.560]  I suggest band.video.
[29:24.560 --> 29:29.160]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[29:29.160 --> 29:30.160]  to stop it.
[29:30.160 --> 29:34.280]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[29:34.280 --> 29:38.480]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[29:38.480 --> 29:42.520]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[29:42.520 --> 29:46.320]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[29:46.320 --> 29:57.760]  Be sure and share band.video.
[29:57.760 --> 30:17.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:17.200 --> 30:35.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[30:35.440 --> 30:41.400]  Very thankful to be here on air with you during the 79 days of hell that we predicted, that
[30:41.400 --> 30:47.160]  we told you was coming, and now here we are, and we're telling you what's coming next.
[30:47.160 --> 30:52.480]  Give, you get on the field, and if you take action, and I think you can tell what's coming
[30:52.480 --> 30:53.480]  next yourself.
[30:53.480 --> 30:57.400]  You don't need Alex Jones to tell you, but we're here to share this broadcast and these
[30:57.400 --> 31:04.680]  transmissions with others that are now seeking, but don't yet know what's happening.
[31:04.680 --> 31:09.920]  This enemy doesn't come with, again, army tanks and fighter bombers openly.
[31:09.920 --> 31:14.520]  It comes with spies and operatives and posing as medical companies to slowly poison and
[31:14.520 --> 31:19.400]  dumb us down and get us into a debilitated position for their takeover, and we've been
[31:19.400 --> 31:22.640]  the target the whole time.
[31:22.640 --> 31:28.360]  Of the military industrial complex that Eisenhower said was controlled by a scientific elite
[31:28.360 --> 31:30.760]  of technocrats, that's his speech.
[31:30.760 --> 31:39.160]  They never quote that, watch the 21-minute speech, because he discovered what they were
[31:39.160 --> 31:44.040]  planning and was very upset about it, and that's in the National Archives, and what
[31:44.040 --> 31:46.840]  he was upset about is what you're witnessing now.
[31:46.840 --> 31:51.400]  He did not believe in sterilizing the world population.
[31:51.400 --> 31:57.280]  He believed in industrializing it, and then people stopped having as many kids, but the
[31:57.280 --> 31:59.640]  world didn't go with what Eisenhower wanted.
[31:59.640 --> 32:06.560]  They went with the Royal Commission in 1949 out of the British Empire, and everything
[32:06.560 --> 32:09.160]  you see today is that plan.
[32:09.160 --> 32:16.040]  There's been two competing plans, the British Empire plan and the 1776 plan, and they're
[32:16.040 --> 32:18.040]  both intertwined and connected.
[32:18.040 --> 32:25.200]  I don't blame the British people, they were just a strong outpost of folks that this power
[32:25.200 --> 32:27.040]  used to dominate the planet.
[32:27.040 --> 32:30.440]  Now, of course, they're being betrayed.
[32:30.440 --> 32:39.320]  They're making up homeless on the planet, they're forbearers, conquer.
[32:39.320 --> 32:44.160]  And next segment, I shot a report about this last night because I've had a lot of phone
[32:44.160 --> 32:50.040]  calls, I've seen a lot of news, he's put a debate around the office here about martial
[32:50.040 --> 32:53.920]  law, should President Trump declare martial law?
[32:53.920 --> 32:56.800]  What does that really mean?
[32:56.800 --> 33:04.320]  And I shot this last night with Rob Do, he stayed up here late and put it together, and
[33:04.320 --> 33:09.920]  late last night, before I went to bed, I watched it and I thought, man, that's a really
[33:09.920 --> 33:15.800]  class A report, I think I knocked it out of the park.
[33:15.800 --> 33:19.240]  So if you really want to understand martial law, what it means, what it stands for, what
[33:19.240 --> 33:24.880]  we're facing, next segment, I'm going to give you the expert analysis.
[33:24.880 --> 33:28.720]  But I think you're going to already know the answer yourself.
[33:28.720 --> 33:32.680]  If someone's already brought you into a state of martial law, it is martial law of your
[33:32.680 --> 33:35.400]  own that reboots the system.
[33:35.400 --> 33:40.880]  So we need a U.S. military response to the globalist.
[33:40.880 --> 33:44.120]  As you can see, they're engaged in just a criminal takeover, so you can call that martial
[33:44.120 --> 33:49.960]  law, you can call a new Declaration of Independence, you can call it whatever the hell you want.
[33:49.960 --> 33:53.520]  And I'm certainly not one that's going to lead it because that's not my expertise.
[33:53.520 --> 34:01.400]  My expertise is in the parliamentary procedure that has been overturned, and now we're in
[34:01.400 --> 34:02.900]  a state of war.
[34:02.900 --> 34:07.880]  Here's from Wikipedia, martial law is the imposition of direct military control of normal
[34:07.880 --> 34:14.960]  civilian functions or suspension of civil law by a government, especially if in response
[34:14.960 --> 34:20.760]  to a temporary emergency where civil forces are overwhelmed or in an occupied territory.
[34:20.760 --> 34:25.680]  They're overwhelmed, they're occupied by globalists, the blue cities and states are cut off, announcing
[34:25.680 --> 34:28.400]  they want an end to the country, they don't want it to exist.
[34:28.400 --> 34:34.240]  That is the definition where martial law is brought in.
[34:34.240 --> 34:40.920]  We're already under CHICOM globalists left as blue state, blue city martial law.
[34:40.920 --> 34:45.360]  But I don't want to call it martial law because the public is ignorant about the different
[34:45.360 --> 34:51.520]  usages of it, offensive martial law, coup-based martial law, outside funded martial law that
[34:51.520 --> 34:56.640]  you're seeing with the medical tyranny, and now the paramilitary lockdown of small businesses,
[34:56.640 --> 34:57.880]  that's siege upon the people.
[34:57.880 --> 35:04.600]  And then there are those that engage in dalliances of their superiority and their moral fortitude
[35:04.600 --> 35:09.800]  who don't even understand the larger history of military action against martial powers
[35:09.800 --> 35:18.840]  against you, which is the realm we are already in.
[35:18.840 --> 35:23.840]  But we need an attitude of we're willing to go to that because this is an outside illegitimate
[35:23.840 --> 35:30.880]  martial law takeover, and we must have the states declare the emergencies and demand
[35:30.880 --> 35:36.080]  the president move against the foreign threat, not to overturn the constitution, but to defend
[35:36.080 --> 35:37.080]  it.
[35:37.080 --> 35:43.840]  Imagine if Hitler had invaded, or something like that, we go, oh, they declared an emergency
[35:43.840 --> 35:46.920]  to be Hitler, we can't do that, what does that even mean?
[35:46.920 --> 35:50.880]  You want the CHICOMs and the left-running things, or do you want Trump to know he's
[35:50.880 --> 35:53.840]  got a green light to take action and stop these people?
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.320]  If the FBI sits there and pisses on themselves all day, and all these are bureaucrats, if
[35:58.320 --> 36:06.440]  the military will follow the commander-in-chief like George Washington, we should do it again.
[36:06.440 --> 36:12.960]  That's where we've been taken, that's where we are, we're being conquered right now.
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.600]  And if you want to sit there and be conquered, play games and act like it's just another
[36:16.600 --> 36:21.320]  election, and oh, we'll have fun with Joe Biden, no we won't, they're coming after us,
[36:21.320 --> 36:24.120]  they're going to keep their foot on our neck forever.
[36:24.120 --> 36:30.600]  They're showing some footage out of Asia martial law, that's enough, just listen, guys, the
[36:30.600 --> 36:36.920]  whole point is, is that this is a new type of war that we're facing, but I'll break the
[36:36.920 --> 36:41.720]  report down next segment.
[36:41.720 --> 36:48.560]  I call it a new declaration of independence, and that was paramilitary forces saying we
[36:48.560 --> 36:54.440]  don't follow your law anymore, you're fraud, you've broken contracts with us, you're a
[36:54.440 --> 36:58.920]  scam artist, you're an oppressor, you're a tyrant, we are declaring that we are separate
[36:58.920 --> 37:09.920]  from you, and we're going to defend ourselves, and the king of England called it a mutiny.
[37:09.920 --> 37:15.200]  That's what this country is, well I declare mutiny against the illegitimate election in
[37:15.200 --> 37:19.960]  the chai comms in Joe Biden, he's not my president, I'll never submit to him, you can call it
[37:19.960 --> 37:26.080]  whatever the hell you want.
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.640]  All these other people can sell out, they can roll over, they can piss themselves yellow,
[37:30.640 --> 37:36.680]  I'm not doing it.
[37:36.680 --> 37:42.000]  The second American civil war is underway, only this time it's not north versus south,
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.120]  it's chai comm, globalist, allied forces that want to bring the country down and end its
[37:48.120 --> 37:53.440]  very existence, versus the people that have been under attack and demoralized and deindustrialized
[37:53.440 --> 37:57.920]  for decades, finally waking up and saying no, and Trump winning in a landslide, and the
[37:57.920 --> 38:03.200]  globalist thiefs with dominion and smartmatic and sorrows, and the communists Chinese coming
[38:03.200 --> 38:08.880]  in and stealing it in mass in everybody's face.
[38:08.880 --> 38:12.520]  I want your take on should Trump quote declare martial law, we're going to open the phones
[38:12.520 --> 38:16.200]  up for the first 30 minutes of the next hour, then we've got Dr. Francis Boyle joining us
[38:16.200 --> 38:22.880]  on how the Pfizer MRA in vaccine is a bio weapon, this is life saving and critical emergency
[38:22.880 --> 38:26.960]  information, tell everyone you know tune in now, it is in the game.
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.240]  Of course the mainstream media says we're the enemy, because they're the enemy, of course
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.040]  they say we're discredited, because they're discredited.
[38:34.040 --> 38:38.720]  They told you none of this was coming, no lockdowns, no checkpoints, no phantom viruses,
[38:38.720 --> 38:42.840]  we told you exactly what was coming, because they all wrote how they were planning it in
[38:42.840 --> 38:46.640]  their own battle plans.
[38:46.640 --> 38:50.560]  I'm going to air this special report when we come back, and I've got so much more, but
[38:50.560 --> 38:58.200]  please don't forget, we've launched the Christmas specials, if you order by the 18th, you will

[39:49.240 --> 39:54.000]  the martial law, he answered the question straight ahead.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.280]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left, it can be very stressful dealing
[39:59.280 --> 40:04.880]  with facts you refuse to accept, if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[40:04.880 --> 40:11.160]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com, studies have
[40:11.160 --> 40:17.120]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[40:17.120 --> 40:22.680]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[40:22.680 --> 40:29.160]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system, recent studies have suggested
[40:29.160 --> 40:36.240]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[40:36.240 --> 40:42.400]  and activity of immune cells, it worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and
[40:42.400 --> 40:48.760]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality, get your ultimate fish oil for
[40:48.760 --> 40:53.840]  a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[40:53.840 --> 40:58.000]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes, then
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.760]  picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major Robert Barons to plan it by the 1920s,
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.840]  is all about corporate global governance, and now you're seeing it, it's not just the
[41:06.840 --> 41:11.200]  blue states, the blue cities, the communists and socialists, nations all working in unison
[41:11.200 --> 41:17.000]  under UN control to establish a medical planetary dictatorship, at the core of it is the Fortune
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.600]  100 corporations, themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families, the Rothschilds,
[41:23.600 --> 41:27.840]  the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty, being at the very heart of that, then you
[41:27.840 --> 41:32.160]  learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time, but
[41:32.160 --> 41:39.320]  they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[41:39.320 --> 41:43.920]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it, they're involved imploding
[41:43.920 --> 41:48.160]  the world economy, that's what the social distancing, the master all about, it's about
[41:48.160 --> 41:52.360]  bankrupting local small businesses, and those that comply, are complying with your own destruction,
[41:52.360 --> 41:55.080]  wake up.
[41:55.080 --> 42:01.280]  PrepareWithAlex.com is a special website with my patriot, because they have agreements with

[42:54.320 --> 42:59.800]  Fox is betrayed, President Trump, as I predicted they would, they've always been part of the
[42:59.800 --> 43:04.200]  establishment and it's only going to get worse, if they're able to keep Trump from
[43:04.200 --> 43:09.280]  rightfully taking office for second term, Ontario 20th, the system is going to drop
[43:09.280 --> 43:13.960]  the hammer harder than ever on this republic, they are going to explode gas prices, they're
[43:13.960 --> 43:17.360]  going to shut down our coal power plants, they're going to cut off the energy source
[43:17.360 --> 43:22.320]  to the US, so it's impossible for factories to move back here, this is economic domination,
[43:22.320 --> 43:27.000]  this is economic war, we are being consolidated, we are being taken over, the democrats aren't
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.600]  mismanaging their blue cities and states, they're consolidating power and control to
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.560]  bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of
[43:36.560 --> 43:41.040]  all the infrastructure and property, this is a monopolistic takeover, that's what the
[43:41.040 --> 43:46.120]  great reset is, clout squab and these other criminals admit it, that's what social distancing
[43:46.120 --> 43:52.120]  is, so your business is only at 25% for several more years, no small businesses will be there,
[43:52.120 --> 44:12.240]  this is a master plan, say no, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, we are all run globalist,
[44:12.240 --> 44:17.320]  martial law, the takeover is already taking place, call it what you will, we must resist
[44:17.320 --> 44:24.280]  this takeover, it is illegitimate, here is my report, should Trump declare martial law,
[44:24.280 --> 44:29.160]  should President Trump declare martial law, we've seen Attorney Lynn Wood come out and
[44:29.160 --> 44:34.360]  say he's declaring limited form martial law, we've seen the former head of defense intelligence
[44:34.360 --> 44:39.160]  agency, General Flynn, recently pardoned by the president come out and say, Trump should
[44:39.160 --> 44:44.800]  declare a type of martial law, well what does martial law really mean, what is the definition
[44:44.800 --> 44:49.880]  of martial law and is that something that needs to be done at this point, we're about
[44:49.880 --> 44:56.000]  to answer that question definitively from history and jurisprudence and our constitution
[44:56.000 --> 45:04.120]  and bill of rights as well as our Declaration of Independence right now.
[45:04.120 --> 45:09.520]  My point about martial law is this simple fact, it's all academic, the average person
[45:09.520 --> 45:14.800]  calling for martial law is like some magical wand that President Trump can wave and President
[45:14.800 --> 45:19.480]  Trump's never called for martial law, President Trump has been working within the system,
[45:19.480 --> 45:23.800]  the constitution the entire time, it's the left that's been working outside the system
[45:23.800 --> 45:28.560]  calling for the UN to come in and run our elections in the New York Times, calling for
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.360]  electors not to be faithful, calling for denying the election of President Trump if it happened
[45:34.360 --> 45:40.400]  and setting up their own government and having secession, martial law is a break with the
[45:40.400 --> 45:46.640]  normal law and the regular system of a country and the imposition of military control during
[45:46.640 --> 45:52.120]  it and so if you look at corporate media, if you look at the globalists, the chikoms,
[45:52.120 --> 45:55.840]  they have ignored the president and the executive branch and they've set up their own form of
[45:55.840 --> 46:00.680]  government or their own form of martial law, here is the standard definition of martial
[46:00.680 --> 46:06.400]  law, is the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions or suspension
[46:06.400 --> 46:11.040]  of civil law by a government especially in response to a temporary emergency where civil
[46:11.040 --> 46:16.920]  forces are overwhelmed or in an occupied territory, so when General Flynn talks about martial
[46:16.920 --> 46:22.680]  law or when Linwood the constitutional lawyer does, they're actually correct that we have
[46:22.680 --> 46:28.440]  a globalist system that is suspended rule of law, that is taken over local governments
[46:28.440 --> 46:32.000]  and that has basically occupied our country.
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.640]  The mainstream media isn't just the enemy of America, it's the occupier, it's the brainwasher,
[46:38.640 --> 46:45.760]  it's the controller that says, oh Trump can't declare himself the victor until Congress has
[46:45.760 --> 46:53.160]  and until the electors are signed up December 15th, but then Biden back in early November
[46:53.160 --> 46:58.520]  declares himself the winner, remember all of that, so they have falsely come in and
[46:58.520 --> 47:04.160]  created their own hysteria, their own danger, their own breakdown of the normal constitutional
[47:04.160 --> 47:08.440]  system and by controlling the blue states and the blue cities and the corporate media
[47:08.440 --> 47:14.880]  in Hollywood as well as the chikoms of the EU, they have imposed this false template
[47:14.880 --> 47:20.400]  to override our due process and our regular system and so that's why General Flynn and
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.800]  that's why Attorney Linwood and that's why Powell and others have come out and said we
[47:25.800 --> 47:31.440]  need to have martial law, but martial law is too simple a term, it's too narrow.
[47:31.440 --> 47:35.400]  We need a new declaration of independence against the globalist, we need an announcement
[47:35.400 --> 47:40.680]  of the chikom threat and how corporate media worked with them and the fraud, we need a declaration
[47:40.680 --> 47:46.080]  laying out all the crimes they've openly committed as our forebearers have done before
[47:46.080 --> 47:47.080]  in the past.
[47:47.080 --> 47:52.840]  Technically you could say the Magna Carta in 1215 was martial law, now why do I raise
[47:52.840 --> 47:59.400]  that point, because so many patriots knew that Obama and knew that Clinton and George
[47:59.400 --> 48:05.640]  Bush Jr. and others before them were planning a UN-instituted martial law, they were canvassing
[48:05.640 --> 48:09.400]  the military, they were asking the military would they be part of martial law, so we
[48:09.400 --> 48:14.440]  all got ready to fight martial law, we all got ready to fight a foreign globalist takeover,
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.520]  so now when people on our side, when we're under globalist attack, when rule of law has
[48:18.520 --> 48:23.400]  been suspended, when the elections being stolen, hear about terms like suspension of the current
[48:23.400 --> 48:29.360]  system and Trump coming in with executive power to restore the republic just like the
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.800]  Declaration of Independence, they think whoa that's permanent martial law, no when George
[48:34.800 --> 48:42.880]  Washington and the founders on July 4th, 1776 declared independence against the crown, it
[48:42.880 --> 48:50.000]  was their own form of martial law overriding King George III and colonial rule.
[48:50.000 --> 48:56.880]  So let's look at the Magna Carta, whereby force of arms, our ancestors, my ancestors
[48:56.880 --> 49:02.480]  declared that we were militarily saying no to their tyranny to set up a system of due
[49:02.480 --> 49:09.440]  process and a system of justice against the tyranny, so you see a martial law can be used
[49:09.440 --> 49:16.280]  to set up a new system of freedom for the people, Magna Carta or the great charter of
[49:16.280 --> 49:21.120]  freedom commonly known as Magna Carta, also Magna Carta great charter is a royal charter
[49:21.120 --> 49:25.360]  of rights agreed to by King John of England at Runnymede near Windsor on the 15th of
[49:25.360 --> 49:31.040]  June 2015, first drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton to make peace
[49:31.040 --> 49:37.760]  between the unpopular standard of rebel barons, it promised the protection of the church rights,
[49:37.760 --> 49:42.800]  protected from the barons from illegal imprisonment, rights to swift justice and limitations on
[49:42.800 --> 49:49.840]  feudal payments to the crown, to be implemented through a council of 25 barons, neither side
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.200]  stood behind their commitments and other civil war broke out.
[49:54.200 --> 50:01.160]  But it was that idea of a people's Congress, first foot nobles evolving towards the people
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.880]  or devolving towards the people that led to our modern system.
[50:04.880 --> 50:11.600]  So it was martial law, military rule in 1215, saying no to the absolute military rule of
[50:11.600 --> 50:14.160]  a king that then led to freedom.
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.880]  I'm not endorsing the concept of martial law as the fount or the progenitor of freedom.
[50:19.880 --> 50:25.560]  I'm simply pointing out that it is a label and a name of any new revolutionary challenging
[50:25.560 --> 50:32.400]  system to a current form of dictatorial control, and that in most cases it has negative connotations
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.880]  that I oppose, but in some cases of the Magna Carta 1215 or George Washington 1776, it has
[50:38.880 --> 50:42.920]  very, very positive connotations that historians don't want you to look at.
[50:42.920 --> 50:49.280]  The United States Declaration of Independence is a declaration of war against centralized
[50:49.280 --> 50:55.680]  power, against King George III, against empire, a declaration of war about nobles and cliques
[50:55.680 --> 50:58.240]  and inside our groups controlling populations.
[50:58.240 --> 51:05.920]  It is a declaration of human individual freedom as of the model of the world around, but it's
[51:05.920 --> 51:12.240]  been the model of the entire world since 250 years ago it was signed.
[51:12.240 --> 51:17.360]  But some would tell you it was martial law, but here's the main body of what I'm saying.
[51:17.360 --> 51:19.600]  Here's the central point.
[51:19.600 --> 51:23.680]  The Communist Chinese, the globalists, the big Magna Banks that are conquering the United
[51:23.680 --> 51:30.640]  States right now through frauds, want corporate martial law to override our bill of rights,
[51:30.640 --> 51:34.080]  our Constitution, our private property, our independence.
[51:34.080 --> 51:39.240]  And I want the courts, and I want Congress, and I want the legislatures to legally and
[51:39.240 --> 51:46.080]  lawfully, through our Constitution, that is a strong bulwark to reject what they've done.
[51:46.080 --> 51:53.360]  And I don't believe that some nebulous, deep state martial law is the answer to that tyranny.
[51:53.360 --> 51:59.360]  But if the local governments, the state governments, and Congress and the courts will not stand
[51:59.360 --> 52:04.720]  up against the hostile foreign takeover, that it's up to the president to announce a new
[52:04.720 --> 52:10.160]  declaration of independence and a new constitutional federation to defend our bill of rights and
[52:10.160 --> 52:15.400]  Constitution against the outside corporate takeover that's taking place.
[52:15.400 --> 52:20.720]  We need that declaration that the system is broken and that the system is illegitimate,
[52:20.720 --> 52:22.460]  that the system has failed.
[52:22.460 --> 52:25.000]  We need the leadership of the president.
[52:25.000 --> 52:26.960]  And I don't call that martial law.
[52:26.960 --> 52:32.520]  I call that a declaration of independence of the year 2020 against the globalists and
[52:32.520 --> 52:38.040]  against the New World Order that will rally the people to a set defined system that we
[52:38.040 --> 52:40.440]  stand for that binds us together.
[52:40.440 --> 52:47.560]  And that is our bill of rights, our Constitution, July 4th, 1776, a re-upload of what has been
[52:47.560 --> 52:52.360]  under attack, a new declaration of what we stand for and who we are.
[52:52.360 --> 52:54.280]  That is not martial law.
[52:54.280 --> 53:00.080]  That is, we the people through our president declaring that the other institutions have
[53:00.080 --> 53:07.200]  been overrun by globalists and traitors and that it will be a military action by the president
[53:07.200 --> 53:12.720]  and by we the people just as happened with George Washington 250 years ago in that great
[53:12.720 --> 53:19.520]  six-year struggle to remove that threat that is seeking to dominate and control us.
[53:19.520 --> 53:23.360]  Now take the word martial, meaning military, in connection to martial law.
[53:23.360 --> 53:27.960]  This is so then again, there is the headline 115,000 views put up last night should Trump
[53:27.960 --> 53:30.920]  declare martial law a special report.
[53:30.920 --> 53:34.560]  And really that's a red herring.
[53:34.560 --> 53:38.000]  Trump must defend us from enemies foreign and domestic.
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.960]  We know it's a multinational, globalist, chai-com, EU, MSM takeover.
[53:42.960 --> 53:45.200]  They bought off the blue states, the blue cities.
[53:45.200 --> 53:46.680]  They are in insurrection.
[53:46.680 --> 53:48.080]  They are occupied.
[53:48.080 --> 53:50.000]  They are saying America shouldn't exist.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.720]  They want to keep their sectors closed to bankrupt them to make those populations dependent
[53:54.720 --> 53:56.800]  on them.
[53:56.800 --> 54:02.840]  And so enemy globalist forces are in control of over a third of the country and around half
[54:02.840 --> 54:06.400]  the population and are now putting them under siege.
[54:06.400 --> 54:12.200]  They have laid siege upon them to drive them into submission to bankrupt them in a great
[54:12.200 --> 54:16.280]  leap forward or a great reset to be put into the communes.
[54:16.280 --> 54:18.960]  This is an all admitted plan, Claes-Sawad admits it.
[54:18.960 --> 54:20.720]  So we're under military attack.
[54:20.720 --> 54:21.840]  We're under economic attack.
[54:21.840 --> 54:23.680]  We're under globalist attack.
[54:23.680 --> 54:28.000]  And we're sitting here going to the Supreme Court and rearranging deck chairs in the Titanic.
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.840]  Those states are run by criminals and are in rebellion.
[54:31.840 --> 54:36.080]  My God, Trump's got a thousand percent more rights than Abraham Lincoln did.
[54:36.080 --> 54:39.640]  And it's time for him to go after the globalists now.
[54:39.640 --> 54:41.840]  Go after them now.
[54:41.840 --> 54:49.440]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year, just wait until you see the
[54:49.440 --> 54:50.440]  year 2021.
[54:50.440 --> 54:51.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[54:51.440 --> 54:55.840]  I started in full wars, but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[54:55.840 --> 55:00.040]  And now in full wars is more important than ever because the general population of the
[55:00.040 --> 55:03.480]  planet is weighing up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on.
[55:03.480 --> 55:07.760]  That's why it's so important to those of you out there that have supported the broadcast
[55:07.760 --> 55:12.000]  and the websites and the films and all the rest of the information we put out to realize
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.640]  how important your work has been and to redouble your efforts.
[55:14.640 --> 55:15.640]  So I salute you.
[55:15.640 --> 55:16.640]  And I thank you.
[55:16.640 --> 55:19.240]  Also, as Christmas is almost here, don't wait.
[55:19.240 --> 55:24.040]  Do your shopping at infowarstore.com, get amazing food, suitable to boost your immune
[55:24.040 --> 55:28.920]  system and make your life so much better overall for adults and children.

[55:39.200 --> 55:45.760]  And again, thank you all for your support and Merry Christmas, God bless.
[55:45.760 --> 55:49.080]  The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[55:49.080 --> 55:52.320]  Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[55:52.320 --> 55:56.680]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they have humanity so much?
[55:56.680 --> 55:58.680]  Why do they love death?
[55:58.680 --> 56:01.280]  Because they hate themselves.
[56:01.280 --> 56:06.280]  They project their own disgust with their soul onto us.
[56:06.280 --> 56:12.280]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[56:12.280 --> 56:13.880]  That's why they hate info wars.
[56:13.880 --> 56:15.000]  We believe in humanity.
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.000]  We think you're beautiful.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  We think you're amazing.
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  Info wars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[56:25.680 --> 56:26.680]  It's now upon us.
[56:26.680 --> 56:29.760]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever.
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.960]  When the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth, we know you're going to override
[56:33.960 --> 56:34.960]  these globalists.
[56:34.960 --> 56:35.960]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[56:35.960 --> 56:39.760]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done, because God's
[56:39.760 --> 56:48.240]  on our side and the globalists know it.
[56:48.240 --> 56:51.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:51.240 --> 57:13.200]  I'm going to give the number out right now for two segments I'm going to take your calls
[57:13.200 --> 57:14.200]  on.
[57:14.200 --> 57:15.600]  You understand what I'm saying about martial law.
[57:15.600 --> 57:19.400]  You understand that we're already under globalist martial law and they're taking over the country
[57:19.400 --> 57:21.800]  militarily, economically, culturally.
[57:21.800 --> 57:25.800]  Trump needs to start calling them out as chai-com agents and saying they're attempting to destroy
[57:25.800 --> 57:30.280]  our country and they are foreign enemies because the evidence is pouring in, we'll cover it
[57:30.280 --> 57:36.760]  next segment, all confirm what we broke last week, that dominion 400 million secretly from
[57:36.760 --> 57:39.400]  the communist Chinese government.
[57:39.400 --> 57:44.200]  Trump gives a speech on that game over, game over.
[57:44.200 --> 57:45.200]  We have them.
[57:45.200 --> 57:56.360]  Here's a toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, first-time callers,
[57:56.360 --> 58:00.360]  long-time callers, I don't care, but I'm just taking seven or eight calls because then we're
[58:00.360 --> 58:01.360]  going to have guests on.
[58:01.360 --> 58:05.800]  But I want to hear from you on martial law on what should be done, because again, they've
[58:05.800 --> 58:08.800]  already taken over the states, they're already engaged in mass fraud.
[58:08.800 --> 58:10.920]  Here's a report on what we're dealing with.
[58:10.920 --> 58:14.040]  You go to the ocean, you say there's no fish in it.
[58:14.040 --> 58:15.880]  There are no fish in the ocean.
[58:15.880 --> 58:22.440]  What do you think of Attorney General Barr extending the Durham investigation into the
[58:22.440 --> 58:28.880]  Obama administration, the FBI, the intelligence community, extending that investigation well
[58:28.880 --> 58:31.400]  into 2021?
[58:31.400 --> 58:32.680]  I think that is fine.
[58:32.680 --> 58:34.040]  I have no problems with it.
[58:34.040 --> 58:41.880]  I do believe that John Durham is going to carry out his responsibilities ably and hopefully
[58:41.880 --> 58:43.920]  not with any type of political influence.
[58:43.920 --> 58:48.400]  I sat down for eight hours with John Durham and his team answering all his questions.
[58:48.400 --> 58:53.000]  And so looking back at 2016, were there some mistakes made in terms of the FISA applications,
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  other types of things?
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.280]  Yes, apparently there were.
[58:56.280 --> 59:00.280]  But that doesn't mean that there was criminal intent and there was no spying on Donald Trump's
[59:00.280 --> 59:01.280]  campaign.
[59:01.280 --> 59:06.240]  I don't know if it's true that La Cosa knows for a mafia had dead or whoever dressed up
[59:06.240 --> 59:07.240]  like a woman.
[59:07.240 --> 59:08.240]  I don't know if he was gay.
[59:08.240 --> 59:09.240]  I really don't care.
[59:09.240 --> 59:10.720]  We're federal officers.
[59:10.720 --> 59:11.720]  Everyone remains seated.
[59:11.720 --> 59:16.440]  The point is, is that he did say that the mafia did not exist.
[59:16.440 --> 59:17.440]  Okay?
[59:17.440 --> 59:24.640]  He gave testimony in the 40s and early 50s that the mafia did not exist.
[59:24.640 --> 59:25.640]  Okay?
[59:25.640 --> 59:35.080]  Now, that is a less ridiculous statement and it's totally ridiculous, totally ridiculous
[59:35.080 --> 59:37.520]  than saying there's no election or voter fraud.
[59:37.520 --> 59:42.520]  Now the Washington, where the Justice Department says there is no evidence of widespread fraud
[59:42.520 --> 59:47.720]  in the 2020 election, they're just, we don't see a widespread voter fraud, but we will
[59:47.720 --> 59:50.240]  investigate every case we hear.
[59:50.240 --> 59:56.120]  Baseless claims by the president and his supporters that there's been widespread voter fraud
[59:56.120 --> 1:00:00.640]  and that the election was somehow rigged or stolen from President Trump.
[1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:07.840]  Yeah, this is going to be, I mean, this is the appellate record.
[1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:10.160]  Hey, Jesse, what is all this stuff?
[1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:13.600]  This is evidence of voter fraud.
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:15.120]  Finders one through 20.
[1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:20.560]  Again, that's like saying cows don't go move or the sun didn't come up this morning or
[1:00:20.560 --> 1:00:21.560]  it is true.
[1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:22.560]  There's violence across the whole country.
[1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:25.120]  Do you disavow the violence from Antifa?
[1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:27.120]  That's happening in Portland right now.
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:30.840]  It's a myth that's being spread only in Washington, DC.
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:32.000]  About Antifa in Portland?
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Yes.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.480]  Sure, there's videos everywhere online.
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:40.760]  There's fires and riots, there's throwing fireworks at federal officers, DHS is there.
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:41.760]  Look online.
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:44.160]  It gets crazy, Mr. Nattler.
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:47.680]  And they just sit there and they do this and it's not going to work.
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:51.840]  There's a total loss of confidence in the system, a total loss of confidence in the
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:01:09.680]  mainstream media, a total loss of confidence and people are pissed.
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:14.040]  I go to the grocery store, I go to a doctor's appointment, and I mean, you know, used to
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:15.040]  some...
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:16.040]  Oh, I always say we like you.
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:20.480]  I have black people, brown people, Asian people, old people, gay people, straight people.
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:22.960]  You know, I go into the dental appointment and they're like, oh Alex, you're right about
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:23.960]  everything.
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:24.960]  Oh, I always think you're wrong.
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:25.960]  No, no, no.
[1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:26.960]  I mean, I'm just a bellwether.
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:27.960]  I'm a gage.
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:32.120]  The globalists have screwed the pooch and now they're coming with forced inoculations
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:35.560]  and ID cards and world government and saying, oh, there's no side effects.
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:39.680]  No one gets sick from it when the damn studies say 80% get super sick when you take the COVID
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:40.680]  vaccine.
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:42.840]  This is a crazy cold of lunatics.
[1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:44.840]  What the hell's going on here?
[1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:52.720]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:59.960]  Back in 1996, the head of the World Food Program said that they would use food and global lockdowns
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:04.160]  due to a virus scare to bring in world government.
[1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:08.320]  That also came out in the North American Union documents that judicial watch and Lou Dobbs
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:10.960]  got more than 15 years ago as well.
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:14.320]  So we know their plan and if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going to
[1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:19.080]  cause not just a worldwide depression, but mass starvation of hundreds of millions.
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:22.920]  Millions have already starved to death, not from COVID, but from the lockdown.
[1:02:22.920 --> 1:02:26.640]  That's why it's important for people in North America to get prepared for hell all over
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:27.640]  the world.
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:32.000]  But we have high quality, horrible food, ready to ship to you the last 25 years and prepare

[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:16.360]  We now take you live to the front lines of the resistance, protesting worldwide because
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:17.360]  of your support.
[1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:22.720]  This is the info war.
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:29.240]  We now take you live to the central Texas commence center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:32.600]  You're listening to alex Jones.
[1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:37.800]  We're going into corporate union, global government, permanent lockdown, martial law
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:39.720]  through corporate governance.
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:44.680]  As I was told by one of the heads of the major three banks 10 years ago, 13 years ago now,
[1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:46.440]  hard to believe it's been that long.
[1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:51.680]  My guys, that was 2006, 14 years ago, face to face.
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:56.000]  People say, well, tell us who said it was said in confidence.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:02.160]  Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger group at the time, did in front of John Harmon try
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:04.080]  to get me to sell out.
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:07.920]  And so I can tell you that story because he did it in front of somebody, but they've
[1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:11.480]  done it 20, 30 times, gotten very direct.
[1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:13.840]  Now it's just huge threats.
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:20.240]  But the public is waking up to how real the new world order is right now.
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:25.840]  I want to take your phone calls in this segment in the next, and Dr. Francis Boyle, author
[1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:29.600]  of the U.S. biological weapons law, they got adopted as world law.
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:31.000]  He prosecuted Slovak Milojevic.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.160]  I mean, he's as high level lawyer as you get.
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:44.160]  And he says the Pfizer mRNA virus vaccine is a bio weapon, it's not a vaccine.
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:47.120]  He'll be joining us coming up.
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:52.560]  Now let me just show you tomorrow's news today, just so you know, we don't make stuff up.
[1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:55.040]  You could have gone and looked this up yourself, a lot of you did.
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:05:07.200]  But notice that we broke this last week on December 1st, seven days ago.
[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:11.240]  Now, why am I telling you this story?
[1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:12.240]  Because I dropped the ball.
[1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:13.840]  I'm a pathetic worm.
[1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:22.440]  I got a call from one of the president's sons when I was in Arizona.
[1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:29.520]  I got a call and they just said, we need you to look in to the Communist Chinese and to
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:39.880]  their connections to Dominion and Smartmatic and Staples Creek.
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:45.920]  And of course, that's all you get told because if somebody knows something quote classified,
[1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:48.040]  they're not supposed to tell you.
[1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:52.360]  It's just like, hey, you might want to look into this, but I'm going to leave it at that.
[1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:59.280]  And so I get this call, I get put in touch with a major computer company who is my advisor
[1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:03.440]  on this and I put a private security firm investigating it and three weeks later they
[1:06:03.440 --> 1:06:08.240]  come to me and they go, yeah, we finally, they hit all the filings in Switzerland.
[1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:09.720]  We found them.
[1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:14.960]  And then it took six days until other publications picked it up.
[1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:19.600]  It's big news in Taiwan, it's big news in Japan, it's in local newspapers around the
[1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:20.600]  country.
[1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:27.160]  Now, there it is, Dominion Techie worked for CCP military proxy flagged by US government
[1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:30.360]  for malicious cyber activity and now it's all coming out.
[1:06:30.360 --> 1:06:37.200]  So here's our report December 1st, firm that owns Dominion voting systems received 400 million
[1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:43.640]  from Swiss bank account funded by Chinese Communist government officially and companies
[1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:49.720]  from China before the election, 70 plus percent of the funding, total payoff, 400 million.
[1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:51.680]  That's just what we found.
[1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:54.720]  Got all the names, all the signatures, it's all right there.
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:57.360]  Now look what's in the epic times.
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:02.640]  Look at what's in all these hundreds of publications now, 400 million SEC filing links Dominion,
[1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:05.480]  UBS and China.
[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:09.640]  Communist Chinese government link bank account a 400 million Dominion voting systems before
[1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:11.840]  US election.
[1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:17.080]  Dominion voting systems owners those 400 million securities to China link UBS October 8th, 2020,
[1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:22.200]  zero hedge, got in the game right when we did.
[1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:26.600]  Video deleted from Chinese social media, a professor saying China has people at the top
[1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:32.200]  of American core inner circle of power and influence.
[1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:37.000]  Exclusive Chinese spy targeted California politicians Axios, it's like saying a bear
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:42.040]  takes a dump in the woods, 400 million SEC filing links Dominion, UBS and China.
[1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:44.360]  It goes on and on.
[1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:48.640]  That company Dominion received 400 million from Chinese investment bank in Switzerland.
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:55.200]  Boom, SEC filing show 400 million Chinese link to Dominion made days before election.
[1:07:55.200 --> 1:07:57.680]  It's all breaking.
[1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:01.480]  Firm that owned Dominion voting systems, 400 million from Swiss bank account with connection
[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:06.440]  to Chinese government before election.
[1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:07.920]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:08.920]  So there you go.
[1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:11.840]  And what's scary is it took me three weeks and our crew did a great job and the people
[1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:14.440]  will be hard to investigate and a great job, but that's what I mean.
[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:16.600]  You can't count on Giuliani or Trump.
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:17.600]  They're overwhelmed.
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:20.160]  Giuliani's in the damn hospital.
[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:24.640]  You've got to go out, you've got to research, you've got to put skin in the game to expose
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:25.640]  all this.
[1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:31.720]  But the good news is it's starting to happen right now and it's beautiful and the evidence
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:32.720]  is incredible.
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:39.480]  But we need the president to come out with this from the resolute desk and it's game
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:40.480]  over.
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:44.560]  We need to act now ahead of the Supreme Court next week, ahead of our rallies on Saturday
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:46.080]  and Sunday in DC.
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:49.680]  This is 1776 stuff, boys and girls.
[1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:51.600]  This is total game time right now.
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:54.200]  This is the Super Bowl for the whole future.
[1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:58.400]  And if they get Biden in, they're never going to take their foot off our neck.
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:08:59.720]  We've got to resist this.
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:05.160]  We have total evidence in Georgia, total evidence in Michigan, total evidence in Pennsylvania,
[1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:07.600]  total evidence in Arizona, and it goes on from there.
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:11.360]  We have the moral authority and the states are coming in with their own suits and we
[1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:16.240]  are saying this is illegitimate, this is a fraud, we have the proof, we have it all,
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:19.320]  and this is everything right now.
[1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:23.200]  So that's why they got Chris Wallace desperately yelling at Trump officials going, he's the
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:28.520]  president, say he's the president, no, you are a piece of garbage that no one trusts,
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:29.520]  Mr. Wallace.
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:34.920]  He is not the president, he's not the president-elect, we all know what happened when those polls
[1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:39.680]  closed in Georgia and Pennsylvania and all those other states where Trump won by one
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:43.760]  or two points last time, he's winning by six points, five points, four points, double and
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:46.120]  triple his victory numbers last time.
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:48.880]  We know what you did, you little dirty bastards.
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:51.880]  Even three months of fraudulent ballots, 80 million of them won enough.
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:56.440]  You had to sit there and cram those damn things in there for hours and weeks to steal this
[1:09:56.440 --> 1:10:01.800]  and we won't let you little murderous criminals do it, do you hear me?
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:09.280]  You war-mongering degenerate pedophiles, a pandemic inauguration because no one's going
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:13.800]  to be there for his inauguration, so oh, it's going to be all BS, we'll be in DC, we don't
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:19.320]  care what your mayor says that we're not supposed to be there, burn in hell, this is all America,
[1:10:19.320 --> 1:10:24.360]  we're coming this weekend and we're coming on the inauguration one way or the other.
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:30.360]  We don't accept you, you're illegitimate, oh, you're pathetic, you must accept it.
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:35.240]  You didn't accept Trump with all your lies, you had not one stinking card in your dirty
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:37.800]  little globalist hands.
[1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:43.360]  All we had was victory, all we have is proof, all we have is he's a Chinese communist agent.
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:47.240]  My God, this is disgusting.
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:52.120]  But America was blind and thought we were invincible, America thought that we could never
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:57.200]  be defeated and we were living on our laurels, living on our ancestors and now we realize
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:00.000]  how much trouble we're in.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.720]  That dragon's got its teeth on our leg, well, that's okay, let's politically just stop
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:09.320]  whining about it and just start taking our thumbs and poking their eyes out and punching
[1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:13.240]  it right in the nose and just all of a sudden you might notice you have the political strength
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:18.920]  to grab it by its ears and just tear its skull right open, but you've got to decide
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:23.360]  you're going to break its head open lovingly, peacefully, politically and that means hitting
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:28.800]  the streets and spreading the word and just letting the globalists know you'll never surrender.
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:32.320]  They're all the sellouts, they're all the trash, they're all the garbage.
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:33.920]  You want to cancel Christmas?
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:41.400]  Never you little degenerate pedophiles, you'll burn in hell and I'll go further.
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:45.480]  We've got three, four times, five times depending on the site, the audience we've had the last
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:46.480]  four years.
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:50.200]  We've got the biggest audiences we've ever had except right before the last election
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:51.200]  we were still on all those platforms.
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:55.400]  You were showing what that means, you have made it for us a success in Band-Aid video
[1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:56.880]  while it was under attack.
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:11:59.080]  This team has kept us on air.
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:02.320]  The crew here and you out there supporting us, but I'll tell you we're bringing in the
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:07.000]  exact same amount of money right now to the account this morning we brought in last year
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.440]  and I've got money to spend and people to put in the field, I can't play games, it takes
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:15.280]  a lot of money to wage this war and I'm spending it throwing it right into that locomotive engine.
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:18.560]  So go to infowarsstore.com, why the hell would you shop at Amazon?
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:20.400]  Why the hell would you shop at Walmart?
[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:25.600]  Why would you shop with the establishment and not shop at mom and pops and not shop
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:26.960]  with patriots?

[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:41.320]  infowarsstore.com, but just know that we are hitting pay dirt when it comes to waking up
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:44.920]  hearts and minds, but all these new listeners aren't buying stuff, that's okay, it's you
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:48.360]  the hardcore listeners that funded this and you're the reason we got a fighting chance,
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:51.200]  a fighting chance, infowarsstore.com.
[1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:58.400]  The great reset, where have I heard of that before, oh, the great leap forward, Mao Zedong
[1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:03.000]  ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically shut down and have the rural
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.240]  people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist
[1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:11.760]  commune control and that's all this is, the big mega banks want to break us to the same
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:15.480]  ones that put Mao Zedong into power and they're creating the process of getting rid of our
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:19.840]  old economy and bringing in the new economy where everything's free because when you're
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:25.360]  a president, well everything's free but you're also a slave, Scotland is going to have universal
[1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:29.520]  guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level, but of course you've got to take those vaccines,
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:35.240]  you can't have any kids and oh, don't worry though, all of the tampons and stuff like
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:37.440]  that's free too as well, I'm not kidding.
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:42.000]  So give me some free paper, give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.040]  but they own you, they control you, that's the great reset, that's why it's got to be
[1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:51.040]  resisted to total takeover and we're biting it at infowars.com.

[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:17.920]  You know you'd think something like rocking around the Christmas tree would not upset
[1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:22.960]  the left, the globalists, but they are joyless scum that want to totally depress inner houses
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:26.880]  alone, they admit that in their own documents, Sean Parker, former head of Facebook came
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:31.920]  out and said our jobs make you depressed alone, these are real sick freaks, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:32.920]  so you have a good time.
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:37.200]  Well, they live in a shack or a mansion, you got a connection to God, God loves you, you're
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:40.440]  amazing and the globalist, well, just be glad you're not them.
[1:15:40.440 --> 1:15:43.920]  Okay, let's race through your calls, Rick in Connecticut.
[1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:47.760]  What do you think about all martial law being invoked?
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:51.520]  All I'm saying is we're already under leftist chai com COVID lockdown, martial law in the
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:53.080]  areas they control.
[1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:57.160]  So when you're occupied and there's an insurrection, if it's illegitimate, then the central government
[1:15:57.160 --> 1:15:58.880]  declares martial law to remove the threat.
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:01.600]  A lot of folks want to act like we're pushing fascism.
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:03.200]  No, this is the opposite.
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:07.160]  It's our due process and our rights being overthrown.
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:09.000]  I say Trump's derelict in duty.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.040]  I say it's time to arrest the globalist.
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:14.960]  I don't care the FBI sits there with their thumbs up their ass.
[1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:15.960]  Yes.
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:16.960]  Go ahead.
[1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:17.960]  Absolutely.
[1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:20.760]  They are, they are throwing it in our face.
[1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:26.780]  We have the Georgia governor on TV yesterday is behind the American flag in the Chinese
[1:16:26.780 --> 1:16:27.780]  Communist flag.
[1:16:27.780 --> 1:16:30.880]  And then this morning, my wife turns on the, it's worse.
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:33.880]  He asked them to come buy up the, the voting machine company.
[1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:35.120]  Turns out he was involved in that deal.
[1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:40.280]  I mean, that, that governor's crooked on top of it though, but on the local news station,
[1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:45.200]  I have the, the news anchor, uh, she's wearing a Chinese outfit.
[1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:47.320]  They are throwing it in our thing.
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:48.320]  Oh yeah.
[1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:51.800]  I remember Hillary, remember Hillary in the debates with him four years ago would wear
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:54.880]  mal outfits, the exact same dress as Mao's wife.
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:55.880]  Remember that?
[1:16:55.880 --> 1:16:56.880]  Stop it.
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:58.240]  Hillary wears Chinese, Chinese dress.
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:16:59.400]  Oh, oh yeah, brother.
[1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:01.760]  Oh, this is all sick, isn't it?
[1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:02.760]  It's disgusting.
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:06.760]  They, they are, I'm out there every day spreading the word out about this, talking about you
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:07.760]  guys.
[1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:12.280]  I got walking around in Connecticut, not wearing a mask, going to every place I go to, spreading
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:14.600]  the word, telling everybody about this.
[1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:19.200]  And it's, it's disgusting how much of a trance these people are, are in.
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:20.200]  Everybody around me.
[1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:24.640]  And it's like, I'm doing every, everything I can to fight and to fight for our freedom.
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:25.640]  This is all we've got.
[1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:27.360]  This is our last chance, man.
[1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:28.840]  We need Trump to do his job.
[1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:29.840]  No, I hear you.
[1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:30.840]  I hear you, brother.
[1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:33.520]  And, and, and the one photo they found is her similar to Mao.
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:38.200]  There are shots of her in actual Chinese silk outfits in China and here.
[1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:42.480]  And again, it's all just a signal of we're with the evil, we're with the globalist takeover
[1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:45.560]  because the globalist put economies in power in China.
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:47.240]  They're using them as their main host.
[1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:49.520]  Now they want us to be the main host as well.
[1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:52.480]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:54.000]  Let's talk to Jefferson in Virginia.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  You're on the air, sir.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:57.040]  You say we're 10 days from martial law.
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:59.560]  What do you think's happening?
[1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:00.560]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[1:18:00.560 --> 1:18:01.560]  Good to talk to you.
[1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:02.560]  To talk to you.
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:07.160]  Yeah, I think when his task force, the executive order task force that was set up two years
[1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:11.400]  ago to look into foreign interference in our elections comes back with its report after
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:13.560]  45 days after the election.
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:18.720]  It'll be so clear cut that he's going to have to declare martial law or something very,
[1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:19.720]  very close to it.
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:22.760]  I'm going to say, how do you respond to a foreign occupation with collaborators?
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:25.200]  The only thing is martial law.
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:26.200]  Right.
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:28.920]  And we all just have to get behind the notion of it.
[1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:32.320]  Nobody wants this to happen, but it's the only thing short of civil war that we can
[1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:34.000]  do to stop the civil war from happening.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:37.720]  I think we had the discussion months ago where they're clearly pushing us into a civil war
[1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:38.720]  scenario.
[1:18:38.720 --> 1:18:39.720]  That's right.
[1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:40.920]  You called it a month ago and you predicted this.
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:42.360]  Well, folks, what you said then.
[1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:45.680]  Well, they were going to push us into a civil war that they don't care whether they win
[1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:46.680]  or lose.
[1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:50.640]  They're just going to crash our economy and our currency and the dollars no longer going
[1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:53.400]  to be the reserve currency of the globe.
[1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:55.600]  And that will basically undo us forever.
[1:18:55.600 --> 1:18:56.600]  That's right.
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:18:59.400]  All these leftists are so arrogant thinking they're about to be in charge.
[1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:00.400]  No.
[1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:03.640]  Biden's being put in that even if he wins, he looks weak and America implodes.
[1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:05.960]  The only hope is getting Trump back in seriously.
[1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:09.880]  I mean, they have really set this up.
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:15.960]  And I think in Georgia, it's pretty obvious that they allowed 66,000 underage people to
[1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:19.160]  register to get the absentee ballot application sent to them.
[1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:23.320]  Now, where those votes went and who they went for, I don't think underage people would vote
[1:19:23.320 --> 1:19:24.320]  for Trump.
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:28.320]  They were probably designed to vote for Biden, but on the down ballot.
[1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:29.320]  That's right.
[1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:33.160]  Project Veritas caught them in a bunch of states, sending ballots into middle school and high
[1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:38.160]  school students, and then the teachers would then bundle those ballots, which again is
[1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:41.120]  a federal and state crime.
[1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:45.120]  So these runoffs in Georgia, these Senate seats in Georgia should not even be in a runoff
[1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:50.320]  situation because Purdue essentially had more than 50% of the vote in his favor.
[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:54.520]  I don't know why everybody's looking down ballot on the ballot and saying these senatorial
[1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:59.160]  votes are just as invalid as the presidential votes for Biden.
[1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:01.160]  I agree with the God bless you, sir.
[1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:06.320]  They have put us in the position of a globalist, corporate medical martial law.
[1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:07.320]  What does Trump do?
[1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:08.440]  He declares the enemy.
[1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:09.440]  He goes after it.
[1:20:09.440 --> 1:20:13.640]  He must use his presidential power, but I understand that.
[1:20:13.640 --> 1:20:14.640]  That sounds crazy.
[1:20:14.640 --> 1:20:15.640]  It doesn't sound normal.
[1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:19.320]  We're not in normal situations here, ladies and gentlemen, so it's easy to be an armchair
[1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:22.320]  quarterback and say the word martial law scary.
[1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:24.640]  Call it Declaration of Independence, call it whatever you want.
[1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:29.440]  We must resist this and it should be through the president and the states that understand
[1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:31.360]  what's happening and we will win quickly.
[1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:32.440]  The enemy will fold.
[1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:36.600]  They've never met opposition, which is why they're openly pissing on our face and declaring
[1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:38.520]  China is our master.
[1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:43.840]  No, I will not be part of that, especially when it's an endless lockdown to impoverish
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:44.840]  everybody.
[1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:45.840]  You jerks.
[1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:48.120]  Because we're supposed to get a great leap forward, too.
[1:20:48.120 --> 1:20:49.480]  That's what the great reset is.
[1:20:49.480 --> 1:20:50.640]  Look into it, folks.
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:53.120]  Remember, you were warned if they succeed.
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:54.240]  You're in desperate straits.
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:55.240]  We all are.
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:58.560]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:20:59.560]  Megan in Texas.
[1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:00.560]  You're on the air.
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:01.560]  Welcome.
[1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:02.560]  Thanks for holding.
[1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:03.560]  Hey, Jones.
[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:06.880]  Thanks for the privilege to march with you in DC and we look forward to doing it again
[1:21:06.880 --> 1:21:10.000]  this Saturday as President Trump.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.680]  He absolutely needs to declare martial law.
[1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:15.240]  We have governor officials, elected officials, look at Kent, look at our judiciary.
[1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:18.280]  The judge on General Flynn's case is ignoring a presidential pardon.
[1:21:18.280 --> 1:21:19.280]  I'm glad you resist.
[1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:20.280]  Totally illegal.
[1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:25.040]  Never before done, insurrection, saying I don't care if the Justice Department dropped
[1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:26.040]  the case.
[1:21:26.040 --> 1:21:27.040]  I don't care about her law.
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:28.040]  He's got to drop it.
[1:21:28.040 --> 1:21:29.240]  I don't care if there's a fricking pardon.
[1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:31.480]  He says we will put him in prison.
[1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:32.480]  This is a little.
[1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:35.240]  The martial law from this damn judge.
[1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:36.240]  Absolutely.
[1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:37.240]  The press is infiltrated.
[1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:38.240]  Our education is-
[1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:39.240]  Our education of normal law.
[1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:40.240]  Our medical is highly operated.
[1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:43.900]  And we're all, oh, what are we going to do about it?
[1:21:43.900 --> 1:21:44.880]  Arrest him.
[1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:46.740]  We need, yeah, exactly.
[1:21:46.740 --> 1:21:47.980]  They all need to be arrested.
[1:21:47.980 --> 1:21:49.960]  Lincoln put all the press in fricking prison.
[1:21:49.960 --> 1:21:50.960]  That's what Trump needs to do.
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:51.960]  I don't give a crap.
[1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:53.920]  We're being fed propaganda 24 seven.
[1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:55.640]  It is an insurrection.
[1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:59.320]  Trump needs to take control and we need to have the patience rise up in this country.
[1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:00.320]  Well, here's the good news.
[1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:02.060]  A lot of the people then thought they were on the right side.
[1:22:02.060 --> 1:22:07.580]  And what Lincoln did compared to what Trump's got to do is it was a hard choice with Trump. It's totally cutting Rob. You're right
[1:22:08.460 --> 1:22:13.100]  These are all bought and paid for political horse the minute we go after one globalist
[1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:14.380]  They'll all roll over
[1:22:14.380 --> 1:22:20.460]  Instantly you understand how easy it is to win if somebody had some wavos here. Sorry go ahead. Yes, you know
[1:22:20.460 --> 1:22:21.300]  No, absolutely
[1:22:21.300 --> 1:22:25.380]  I always thought that Lincoln was kind of a tyrant with how he with how he handled the situation
[1:22:25.380 --> 1:22:30.140]  But now living through it absolutely not absolutely not they all need to go to jail or worse be try for trees
[1:22:30.140 --> 1:22:33.420]  And then we all know what that's what the penalty penalty for treason is
[1:22:33.980 --> 1:22:39.420]  We have a giant rotting limb on the body of the United States of America called China it needs to be amputated
[1:22:39.420 --> 1:22:41.660]  That's it. Here's the deal the north and south both had beefs
[1:22:42.460 --> 1:22:46.220]  Jackson was able to stop it. The north was out of control. It doesn't matter
[1:22:46.620 --> 1:22:53.020]  That was like brothers and brothers fighting and still you can argue it was Lincoln right or wrong. He did it at such president
[1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:58.060]  This is a chai come globalist take over a pedophile. Yeah, I mean this is hot and dry, baby
[1:22:58.060 --> 1:23:04.300]  The north south east west tonight against the new world order and and we do we do not accept this one way or another
[1:23:04.300 --> 1:23:05.820]  What do you think?
[1:23:05.820 --> 1:23:07.180]  No, I don't accept it
[1:23:07.180 --> 1:23:11.500]  This is not the republic that I was given when I was born and it's not the republic
[1:23:11.500 --> 1:23:18.140]  I'm passing down to my four children. I will have my children inherit the United States of America. They will be free
[1:23:18.460 --> 1:23:19.020]  That's right
[1:23:19.020 --> 1:23:22.620]  And gc ping is a dictator and a rotting dead
[1:23:22.620 --> 1:23:29.020]  Dead corkis of the communist chinese who will be defeated will free the chinese people burn in hell gc ping
[1:23:29.180 --> 1:23:35.820]  You bloated murdering maggot that betrayed your own father and family and let your sister be murdered by the communist
[1:23:35.900 --> 1:23:39.100]  Which you helped murder your own sister you helped murder your own family
[1:23:39.100 --> 1:23:46.700]  So you're worshiped as a stinking traitorous pig burn in hell. I pray god strikes you down gc ping you maggot
[1:23:46.940 --> 1:23:48.940]  We'll be right back stay with us
[1:23:48.940 --> 1:23:55.660]  The project for world government developed by the british empire via Cecil road and picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major
[1:23:55.900 --> 1:23:57.900]  Robert barons the planet by the 1920s
[1:23:58.380 --> 1:24:00.380]  He's all about corporate global governance
[1:24:01.020 --> 1:24:08.060]  And now you're seeing hundreds of blue states the blue cities the communists and socialist nations all working in unison under un control
[1:24:08.380 --> 1:24:13.180]  Establishing medical planetary dictatorship at the core of it is the fortune 100
[1:24:13.180 --> 1:24:20.060]  Corporations themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families the Rothschilds the Rockefellers
[1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:22.780]  The dutch and british royalty being at the very heart of that
[1:24:23.260 --> 1:24:27.020]  Then you learn the dutch and british royalty aren't even dutch or british at the same time
[1:24:27.740 --> 1:24:33.980]  But they go back to the literal counteractula and the wars in between christendom and islam
[1:24:34.860 --> 1:24:36.860]  Those that don't know history really are
[1:24:36.860 --> 1:24:42.940]  Do them to repeat it. They're involved in voting the world economy. That's what the social distancing the master all about
[1:24:43.580 --> 1:24:48.460]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply or comply with your own destruction wake up
[1:24:49.340 --> 1:24:51.340]  Prepare with alex.com

[1:26:06.220 --> 1:26:07.580]  And intestines
[1:26:07.580 --> 1:26:13.420]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach
[1:26:13.420 --> 1:26:17.580]  So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different
[1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:22.940]  But both are concentrated and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing this out for several months

[1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:21.580]  I'm gonna steal me a silver stallion
[1:27:23.740 --> 1:27:27.500]  With not a mark upon in silky high
[1:27:30.620 --> 1:27:34.140]  See Jimmy can trust me like a brother
[1:27:34.140 --> 1:27:36.140]  And
[1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:40.460]  One day we'll settle up and ride
[1:27:41.260 --> 1:27:43.260]  I have studied history
[1:27:43.660 --> 1:27:45.660]  Welcome back. Thank you for joining us
[1:27:46.220 --> 1:27:48.220]  and
[1:27:49.100 --> 1:27:53.180]  There are times in history that happen every three generations or so
[1:27:53.980 --> 1:27:56.300]  But sometimes every five generations but on average
[1:27:56.940 --> 1:27:58.300]  About every three
[1:27:58.300 --> 1:28:01.500]  We're a great evil organizers and and attempts to take over
[1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:03.500]  And we saw that
[1:28:04.860 --> 1:28:08.700]  75 80 years ago with the nazis we saw it with the evil empire the communist
[1:28:09.420 --> 1:28:12.060]  In russia. We saw the offshoot of that in communist china
[1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:14.700]  They killed over 80 million of their own people
[1:28:19.260 --> 1:28:22.060]  And then I began to look at the great reset
[1:28:22.700 --> 1:28:29.180]  And claus schwaab and the announcements of the un and the debauch group and the operation lockstep of the Rockefellers
[1:28:29.180 --> 1:28:34.540]  And the bio weapon they developed at the wuhan laboratory that had been made illegal five years previous
[1:28:34.780 --> 1:28:39.980]  The chapel of hill, north, carolina and dr. Francis a boil who came on in
[1:28:42.300 --> 1:28:44.300]  Late february
[1:28:44.860 --> 1:28:48.460]  And and our interview got millions of views. He did other interviews tens of millions of views
[1:28:49.660 --> 1:28:53.340]  Laying out what was going to happen and it all basically happened like he said
[1:28:53.340 --> 1:29:00.460]  And he's the author of the u.s. Biological Weapons Law the main law that's on the books now
[1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:07.260]  That was adopted into the u.n. Law. He's prosecuted. He's the head prosecutor of slobby melangevic at the war crimes tribunal
[1:29:07.260 --> 1:29:09.260]  So he's just high level of lawyers you get
[1:29:09.900 --> 1:29:14.540]  He's a professor and we won't go over his whole bio. He's written a lot of books poems against the empire
[1:29:15.020 --> 1:29:20.540]  But he is a patriot. He went through the same harvard phd that kissinger and others go through about one year
[1:29:20.540 --> 1:29:26.540]  So he was given the green light the poppers class to get the special globalist education, but he used it against him
[1:29:27.580 --> 1:29:29.260]  Now folks
[1:29:29.260 --> 1:29:30.940]  I'm no scientist
[1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:36.940]  But you have the former chief science officer of fizer coming out saying this has the same protein in it
[1:29:37.900 --> 1:29:43.100]  That the balsenta has and this will probably cause autoimmune and and and stop pregnancies
[1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:45.980]  Isn't that just a coincidence when bill gates wants that?
[1:29:45.980 --> 1:29:51.340]  Bill Gates said oh, you know, we got to wait two years to have the vaccine because he wanted to keep the lockdowns going
[1:29:51.340 --> 1:29:55.500]  Trump did warp speed, which I think was a big mistake one of trump's biggest failures
[1:29:56.460 --> 1:29:58.460]  bypassing laws and things
[1:29:58.460 --> 1:30:00.460]  not tricked into it. He's not a scientist
[1:30:01.100 --> 1:30:07.980]  And notice suddenly bill gates has got his vaccine first even beat trump on trumps conventional vaccines that trump was funding
[1:30:08.780 --> 1:30:14.140]  Now why did ever have one for the cold virus? Why did because you can't have one for that now? I read
[1:30:14.140 --> 1:30:16.700]  The head of fizer former chief science officer
[1:30:17.260 --> 1:30:22.140]  And wolf king wood argues that they had of this major advisory e.u. Commission to share the
[1:30:22.700 --> 1:30:28.140]  Parliamentary Assembly the council of europe. I've interviewed wolf king wood argument 10 years ago another subject
[1:30:28.380 --> 1:30:31.740]  These are prestigious people. Okay, prestigious
[1:30:32.380 --> 1:30:40.380]  And they filed this report that I spent days reading because I went and I read all the sign of it reports linked in it till I had a headache
[1:30:41.340 --> 1:30:43.340]  Okay, I'm not going to go into that
[1:30:43.340 --> 1:30:47.180]  Okay, I mean I literally have not had anxiety attacks like this in my life. Okay
[1:30:47.660 --> 1:30:53.420]  I spent days reading every bit of this and I called scientists. I knew they said, you know, that's exactly I talked to chemist. I know
[1:30:55.260 --> 1:30:59.340]  I'm gonna leave it at that on people that are involved in the sterilization of animals at the industrial level
[1:30:59.500 --> 1:31:03.340]  It's a big science and they said that's what this is. Okay
[1:31:05.260 --> 1:31:09.020]  There's a big industry in sterilizing wild animals and stuff. I'll leave it at that but
[1:31:09.020 --> 1:31:14.700]  This is this is a a bio attack. I was thinking what do we call this? I'm trying to get dr. Boyle on for two weeks
[1:31:14.700 --> 1:31:16.700]  He's finally ready to come on
[1:31:16.940 --> 1:31:20.460]  And he says this is a bio weapon attack. This is just one of the mRNA
[1:31:20.460 --> 1:31:23.980]  There's I guess six companies coming out with it or he'll tell us more
[1:31:23.980 --> 1:31:27.580]  So I'm gonna try to shut up now and let him talk, but I want you to understand something
[1:31:27.740 --> 1:31:32.540]  This is hidden in plain view. Let me give you the nightmare headline at info wars.com. There's video
[1:31:33.100 --> 1:31:37.420]  CNN says don't be alarmed if people start dying
[1:31:37.420 --> 1:31:39.420]  after taking it
[1:31:39.420 --> 1:31:43.420]  So this is a whole jump in order of magnitude or maybe two magnitudes
[1:31:43.420 --> 1:31:48.300]  Where they're not even denying vaccines can hurt you or don't protect you. They're saying get ready to die
[1:31:48.300 --> 1:31:50.300]  He's with us for the next hour
[1:31:51.020 --> 1:31:53.020]  Dr. Francis Boyle joins us then
[1:31:53.580 --> 1:31:59.580]  Jason Jones is having a huge rally in DC on Thursday with the Uyghurs 3 million Muslims and death camps
[1:31:59.580 --> 1:32:04.860]  I'm trying to get there early to be part of that. That's big. He's coming up. But this is this is an incredible time with apple
[1:32:04.860 --> 1:32:07.980]  This is an incredible time with apple endorsing the death camps
[1:32:08.380 --> 1:32:12.220]  Lobbying against the law that would just criticize them for being the main recipients of
[1:32:12.780 --> 1:32:14.780]  Components made by the Uyghurs. I mean
[1:32:15.260 --> 1:32:17.100]  this is like
[1:32:17.100 --> 1:32:19.580]  I don't know what you call this period of time, but I'm going to go to dr. Boyle
[1:32:20.220 --> 1:32:25.740]  To give us the latest on this mRNA what it really is. I wouldn't call it a vaccine other side of the subject don't
[1:32:25.740 --> 1:32:26.620]  It's like a
[1:32:26.620 --> 1:32:28.620]  Emutinogenic reprogramming of the cells
[1:32:29.340 --> 1:32:31.660]  An autoimmune response to the placenta protein
[1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:37.980]  And why you're calling it a bio weapon and then we'll unpack all this in context to what you've previously broken here
[1:32:37.980 --> 1:32:41.580]  So thank you so much. Dr. Boyle. We salute you and we appreciate your tireless efforts
[1:32:43.020 --> 1:32:48.380]  Well, thanks. Thank you very much for having me on and happy holidays to all of your
[1:32:48.860 --> 1:32:55.020]  Viewers out there Hanukkah Christmas coming up. I think the most critical thing now
[1:32:56.060 --> 1:32:59.180]  For me to point out is this as we know on
[1:32:59.180 --> 1:33:01.180]  December 10
[1:33:02.220 --> 1:33:04.860]  The fda is meeting to give
[1:33:05.660 --> 1:33:07.660]  this emergency
[1:33:07.660 --> 1:33:09.420]  authorization
[1:33:09.420 --> 1:33:11.420]  To these two
[1:33:11.420 --> 1:33:14.540]  messenger RNA so-called vaccines
[1:33:15.500 --> 1:33:17.660]  Let me go back to you alex
[1:33:18.380 --> 1:33:22.700]  To the original article we discussed in february
[1:33:23.420 --> 1:33:25.420]  on the
[1:33:25.420 --> 1:33:27.420]  proof the smoking gun
[1:33:27.420 --> 1:33:29.420]  that the
[1:33:29.420 --> 1:33:31.420]  COVID-19 came out of that
[1:33:32.060 --> 1:33:33.740]  UNC
[1:33:33.740 --> 1:33:35.100]  BSL 3
[1:33:35.100 --> 1:33:38.300]  North North Carolina with the back Queen from
[1:33:38.940 --> 1:33:40.940]  Wuhan BSL 4
[1:33:41.660 --> 1:33:43.660]  If you have a look at it
[1:33:43.900 --> 1:33:45.900]  One of the principal
[1:33:46.860 --> 1:33:48.140]  investigators
[1:33:48.140 --> 1:33:55.420]  Was the food and drug administration the same people who are going to be giving this emergency
[1:33:55.420 --> 1:33:57.020]  approval
[1:33:57.020 --> 1:34:00.540]  to this I would call frankenshot on
[1:34:01.980 --> 1:34:05.180]  Thursday are the same people who
[1:34:05.980 --> 1:34:14.380]  Developed COVID-19. Let me read the principal authors here. There are eight of them in addition to the back Queen
[1:34:15.580 --> 1:34:18.780]  quote National Center for Toxicological Research
[1:34:19.740 --> 1:34:21.740]  Food and Drug Administration
[1:34:21.740 --> 1:34:24.860]  So the food and drug administration
[1:34:25.820 --> 1:34:27.820]  Were working in cahoots
[1:34:28.460 --> 1:34:32.300]  With the back Queen from the Wuhan BSL 4
[1:34:32.940 --> 1:34:36.620]  And these are the people who on Thursday
[1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:41.660]  Are going to be giving this emergency use authorization
[1:34:42.620 --> 1:34:45.260]  To these extremely dangerous
[1:34:45.260 --> 1:34:52.620]  This messenger RNAs now, you know, if you've taken a course in genetics, you know how powerful
[1:34:53.340 --> 1:35:01.740]  Messenger RNA is it goes into your body. It can do anything. It can just turn around the genetic
[1:35:02.860 --> 1:35:06.300]  Composition of your body. We have no idea
[1:35:07.260 --> 1:35:13.180]  What what these franken shots are the most prestigious scientist out there. We're talking chief, you know
[1:35:13.180 --> 1:35:18.300]  Uh, science officers, you know, if fizer are like this could turn your immune system off or kill you in a
[1:35:19.180 --> 1:35:20.460]  a
[1:35:20.460 --> 1:35:26.940]  Storm of antibodies or it could attack her placenta. I mean, this is like playing around with hydrogen bombs
[1:35:28.220 --> 1:35:34.380]  That's exactly right and uh, but again the critical point is the food and drug administration
[1:35:35.020 --> 1:35:36.540]  manufactured
[1:35:36.540 --> 1:35:43.740]  COVID-19 with the back Queen from the Wuhan BSL 4 and now on Thursday, apparently
[1:35:44.220 --> 1:35:47.100]  They're going to give this emergency approval
[1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:53.740]  for these uh, franken shots that they say are going to
[1:35:54.540 --> 1:36:00.460]  Protect us from the cold with 19 that the FDA helped develop
[1:36:00.780 --> 1:36:04.060]  I mean, this is truly evil as you were saying
[1:36:04.060 --> 1:36:08.780]  Uh in your uh, I know you don't like to speculate. You'll have the floor in the next long segment
[1:36:08.860 --> 1:36:14.620]  But you've got to what the power grab the people behind it using it. They're getting us ready for death
[1:36:15.100 --> 1:36:21.900]  Uh, gait says 700,000 might get sick or die. What is the end game of this when we come back with dr. Boyle?
[1:36:22.620 --> 1:36:27.020]  Francis a Boyle's here with us. My god. I just I mean, this is like
[1:36:27.900 --> 1:36:29.900]  It's all happening. It's totally insane
[1:36:29.900 --> 1:36:35.180]  And big vaccine makers were in trouble last year and now this is their big power grab or what is it?
[1:36:35.420 --> 1:36:39.900]  We'll get big picture with dr. Boyle and then he'll walk through all this and what the top scientists are saying
[1:36:40.140 --> 1:36:45.900]  They're they're filing an injunction saying don't do this. It's insane and seen him goes. It's going to kill some people big deal
[1:36:48.540 --> 1:36:51.740]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year
[1:36:52.380 --> 1:36:54.940]  Just wait until you see the year 2021
[1:36:54.940 --> 1:36:59.580]  I'm out of Jones. I started in full wars, but I couldn't have done any of this without you
[1:37:00.220 --> 1:37:02.780]  and now in full wars is more important than ever because
[1:37:03.420 --> 1:37:07.900]  The general population of the planet is waking up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on
[1:37:08.300 --> 1:37:14.700]  That's why it's so important to those of you out there that have supported the broadcast and the websites and the films and all the rest
[1:37:14.700 --> 1:37:20.300]  The information we put out to realize how important your work has been and to redouble your efforts. So I salute you and I thank you

[1:37:47.180 --> 1:37:53.180]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control
[1:37:53.420 --> 1:37:58.620]  There's a headline out from zero heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global airlines are set to lose
[1:37:59.580 --> 1:38:07.980]  157 billion dollars this year by the end of december. It's already over 130 billion dollars. They've lost. Why would they take part?
[1:38:08.940 --> 1:38:12.540]  In the hoax in the lockdown in the hysteria if it hurts them
[1:38:12.540 --> 1:38:17.980]  We'll see that'll knock out all the smaller lines and it's all they control and it's the same in every single industry
[1:38:18.140 --> 1:38:22.940]  And the big megabanks have unlimited capital. They want to bankrupt the world economy till to buy it up
[1:38:23.820 --> 1:38:29.260]  For pennies on the dollar. That's why the great stock market crash in 29 later turned out was engineered by some central banks
[1:38:29.500 --> 1:38:31.980]  This is how the globalists take control
[1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:35.740]  It stars the third world to death makes the first world poor
[1:38:35.740 --> 1:38:43.020]  It's economic warfare and it gives cover to the big megabanks to create a thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives
[1:38:43.420 --> 1:38:46.300]  Only the truth will set us free info wars.com
[1:38:49.580 --> 1:38:53.420]  The trick that social engineers use is very very simple
[1:38:53.900 --> 1:38:58.780]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization that the trajectory
[1:38:58.780 --> 1:39:04.780]  Of the species is designed by these ever-knowing loving liberal technocrats
[1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:08.540]  And then if we just sit back and enjoy the ride everything will be great
[1:39:08.540 --> 1:39:14.780]  But then they tell us that humans are obsolete not essential and we're bad for the earth that we need to be phased out so
[1:39:15.660 --> 1:39:18.860]  They're very open about what they're doing and they count on us
[1:39:19.580 --> 1:39:23.180]  Just being very passive living in the matrix like system
[1:39:23.180 --> 1:39:30.060]  That they're building but what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom
[1:39:30.700 --> 1:39:36.060]  Is that we control our environment? We build our own environments. We create our own systems
[1:39:36.060 --> 1:39:41.820]  We really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims
[1:39:42.460 --> 1:39:48.140]  But instead we're acting like animals to lay in the globalist by the part of humans and us as cattle and that's the trick
[1:39:48.140 --> 1:39:53.500]  Fox has betrayed president trump as I predicted that they would they've always been
[1:39:53.900 --> 1:39:56.460]  Part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse
[1:39:56.860 --> 1:40:02.220]  If they're able to keep trump from rightfully taking office for second term on jerry 20th
[1:40:02.620 --> 1:40:07.980]  The system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices
[1:40:08.380 --> 1:40:12.460]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to us
[1:40:12.460 --> 1:40:18.140]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic war
[1:40:18.460 --> 1:40:23.740]  We are being consolidated. We're being taken over the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states
[1:40:24.140 --> 1:40:28.220]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them
[1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:35.340]  Absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover
[1:40:35.340 --> 1:40:39.340]  That's what's a great reset is cloud swab and these other criminals admit it
[1:40:39.340 --> 1:40:44.460]  That's what social distancing is so your business is only 25 percent for several more years
[1:40:44.700 --> 1:40:48.540]  No small businesses will be there. This is a master plan. Say no
[1:40:52.140 --> 1:40:54.780]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:40:54.780 --> 1:41:10.780]  Okay, you're tuned in to the end of the second hour of the alex jones show dr. Francis Boyle lawyer researcher
[1:41:12.140 --> 1:41:14.140]  author of the us biological weapons law
[1:41:14.700 --> 1:41:17.980]  One of the top advisors the u.n. On this and absolutely on target
[1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:22.540]  Saying what the former chief science officer a Pfizer is saying
[1:41:22.540 --> 1:41:29.100]  And saying what wolf king would argue ends up a major e.u advisory board very respected saying medical doctors
[1:41:30.060 --> 1:41:35.740]  That this is insane. They're like, this is so dangerous. This is so bad. We don't even are you crazy
[1:41:36.300 --> 1:41:38.940]  You're going to give liability protection something. You don't even think works
[1:41:39.420 --> 1:41:44.780]  And can shut your immune system on or totally turn it up and kill you and doesn't even protect you but attacks the placenta
[1:41:45.100 --> 1:41:47.420]  So it's not what they say it is but we've never had a
[1:41:47.420 --> 1:41:53.020]  Vaccine for the common cold which is again similar to this virus. Look at these headlines see an end
[1:41:53.020 --> 1:41:56.220]  Don't be alarmed if people start dying after taking the vaccine
[1:41:58.140 --> 1:41:59.580]  And it goes on
[1:41:59.580 --> 1:42:05.260]  And on top to use scientists warns COVID-19 vaccine like a sterilization of women stubs comes out and says well
[1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:10.380]  He said it could sterilize women not that it does it. So that's their correction
[1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:13.420]  Wow
[1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:18.540]  So this is what's going on ladies and gentlemen dr. Michael yead on former
[1:42:19.420 --> 1:42:22.300]  Vice president of Pfizer head of science operations
[1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:26.060]  You know the guy that actually runs all the science head of Pfizer head of fire
[1:42:26.060 --> 1:42:31.100]  It's like we have william benning used to head technical at nsa. He was like the number two guy. He actually ran
[1:42:31.660 --> 1:42:35.260]  I mean, that's like you can this is the guy that ran Pfizer is saying don't do this
[1:42:35.420 --> 1:42:38.780]  This is a crime against humanity. Wolfgang Woodard heads up a major commission
[1:42:38.780 --> 1:42:43.260]  The chair of the plant a parliamentary assembly of the council of europe health committee
[1:42:45.100 --> 1:42:47.180]  Let's go back to dr. Ball. I'll just shut up for the nine minutes
[1:42:47.180 --> 1:42:51.420]  We have in this segment and and get into what this does how crazy it is just briefly
[1:42:51.740 --> 1:42:56.940]  What are they thinking? Why would you commit a crime this big and get people ready for a bunch of dead folks for a vaccine?
[1:42:57.260 --> 1:42:59.260]  What the hell is going on here?
[1:43:00.060 --> 1:43:03.020]  Well, that's one other point. I just wanted to elaborate
[1:43:03.660 --> 1:43:06.140]  On your comment of a crime against humanity
[1:43:06.140 --> 1:43:08.140]  Yes, these um
[1:43:08.620 --> 1:43:10.140]  franken shots
[1:43:10.140 --> 1:43:14.620]  Will violate the nuremberg code on medical experimentation
[1:43:15.180 --> 1:43:17.180]  That went back to the
[1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:19.580]  doctor's case at nuremberg
[1:43:20.060 --> 1:43:26.220]  Where we participated in the prosecution for war crimes of the nazi doctors
[1:43:26.700 --> 1:43:32.620]  And that was a manual of stuff and you're a world expert on this explain that you're like the top lawyer when it comes to deciphering
[1:43:33.020 --> 1:43:35.500]  The nuremberg code the geneva convention
[1:43:35.500 --> 1:43:37.500]  This is a blatant violation of that
[1:43:38.460 --> 1:43:44.140]  Yes, it's it's it it's clearly uh, this is uh an experimental
[1:43:45.100 --> 1:43:50.540]  vaccine subject to the uh nuremberg code on medical experimentation
[1:43:51.020 --> 1:43:59.420]  The fda thinks that they can opt out of it indeed the last and by the way under the nuremberg principles
[1:43:59.420 --> 1:44:05.020]  Uh, you cannot plead your domestic legal order to excuse
[1:44:05.740 --> 1:44:09.500]  Violations of nuremberg just following orders professor. Does it cut it?
[1:44:10.540 --> 1:44:18.780]  Right or well, I was just uh obeying the procedures of the fda, right? So, uh, this is uh, uh,
[1:44:19.020 --> 1:44:25.740]  These are nuremberg crimes and we've been through this before alex in the run up to go for one
[1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:31.500]  um, the fda gave emergency authorization to
[1:44:32.860 --> 1:44:34.860]  experimental vaccines for
[1:44:35.660 --> 1:44:42.220]  Biological warfare agents not as dangerous as covet 19, but anthrax and botulin
[1:44:42.460 --> 1:44:46.300]  That's a great point. You've been involved in a lot of those cases. They allowed experimentation on the trips
[1:44:46.540 --> 1:44:50.620]  Hundreds of thousands got sick tens of thousands died conservatively and you're saying this is part two
[1:44:50.700 --> 1:44:54.380]  So I know you only get into facts, but I want you to get into those we'll get into it next hour
[1:44:54.380 --> 1:44:58.060]  But what do you think the motive is you're a smart guy? We're just probably smarter
[1:44:59.020 --> 1:45:05.340]  I just wanted to follow up on that point. Yes. I was involved in the court marshals a doctor who refused to give those
[1:45:05.900 --> 1:45:08.140]  those shots, but those shots
[1:45:08.780 --> 1:45:13.980]  Uh, uh out of 500,000 us troops who were inoculated
[1:45:14.700 --> 1:45:22.700]  Uh, 11,000 died and 100,000 were disabled and those were healthy young men and women
[1:45:22.700 --> 1:45:27.500]  And in our armed forces say that again because people forget botulism anthrax
[1:45:28.620 --> 1:45:33.100]  So why is the medical system doing this? Is it about setting a precedent to murder people? Why?
[1:45:34.540 --> 1:45:39.900]  Well, I think that's what's going on now. We're talking about population reduction. We're going back to the
[1:45:40.620 --> 1:45:43.660]  Kissinger national security memorandum
[1:45:44.220 --> 1:45:47.340]  saying that uh population reduction and control
[1:45:47.340 --> 1:45:54.220]  Are in the national security interests of the united states, but let me go back. I'm gonna give you I gotta back you up
[1:45:54.220 --> 1:45:56.620]  I know a lot of former special operations people
[1:45:56.940 --> 1:46:01.100]  Without this your standard the highest levels they go. Yeah, my buddy died of a vaccine in afghanistan
[1:46:01.100 --> 1:46:06.140]  I'm a buddy died in Germany. They all know people that died from the shots. What you're saying is on record, too
[1:46:06.380 --> 1:46:08.380]  It's like this is crazy. Go ahead
[1:46:09.660 --> 1:46:11.660]  That's correct and in the uh
[1:46:12.700 --> 1:46:14.700]  In the anthrax and botulin
[1:46:14.700 --> 1:46:20.700]  Uh shots it's clear cut violation of the nuremberg code on medical experimentation
[1:46:21.740 --> 1:46:28.620]  We argued that point. Uh, I argued that point in the court marshal of captain dr. Yolanda. He would want
[1:46:29.100 --> 1:46:36.540]  Uh, who refused to give these shots because they violated the nuremberg code on medical experimentation
[1:46:36.540 --> 1:46:44.540]  Um and to uh make a long story short the last time I looked at these figures and and it's been a while
[1:46:44.940 --> 1:46:46.940]  Since I've tried to help
[1:46:47.420 --> 1:46:48.860]  us veterans
[1:46:48.860 --> 1:46:54.700]  Who were subject to these shots, but out of 500 000 who were inoculated?
[1:46:55.500 --> 1:46:57.500]  11 000 were killed
[1:46:57.900 --> 1:47:03.180]  And 100 000 were disabled and those are figures from uh several years ago
[1:47:03.180 --> 1:47:06.380]  The same thing happened in britain. You're seeing today
[1:47:06.940 --> 1:47:08.940]  uh britain gave even uh
[1:47:09.180 --> 1:47:14.940]  More emergency use they did the exact same thing to the uh british troops
[1:47:15.340 --> 1:47:20.620]  I was involved in the blowing the whistle over there in a tv4
[1:47:21.260 --> 1:47:25.980]  Documentary the dirty war the french did not give those shots
[1:47:25.980 --> 1:47:33.420]  Because they had been burned once before in their indochina war with experimental anthrax vaccines
[1:47:33.740 --> 1:47:36.940]  And the french troops did not come down with those shots here
[1:47:37.020 --> 1:47:41.580]  So same thing it's population reduction and a sinister group in the medical corps
[1:47:41.820 --> 1:47:46.540]  That wants to be able to commit crimes cover them up to compromise the medical corps of nations
[1:47:46.780 --> 1:47:51.100]  To then use that medical corps to take over the nation, which is what I think we see happening right now
[1:47:51.100 --> 1:47:58.220]  Well, I'm just going one step at a time here. Alex, you know, I'm a lawyer. I go uh one step at a time
[1:47:58.700 --> 1:47:59.820]  so um
[1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:01.820]  So we've been through this before
[1:48:02.300 --> 1:48:04.300]  And those figures I think
[1:48:04.300 --> 1:48:08.060]  Are just the floor for what we can expect to happen here
[1:48:08.540 --> 1:48:16.220]  Because these messenger RNA vaccines that the FDA is going to approve on uh december 10 are completely novel
[1:48:16.220 --> 1:48:23.820]  And extremely dangerous. So yes, I think we're going to see a mass killer now yesterday in the uh
[1:48:24.380 --> 1:48:28.460]  Wall Street Journal was an article by scott gotley
[1:48:29.420 --> 1:48:31.420]  Indicating what their agenda is
[1:48:32.060 --> 1:48:33.020]  Scott
[1:48:33.020 --> 1:48:38.940]  Scott lead was former head of the FDA again the same people who gave us
[1:48:39.580 --> 1:48:43.580]  Covid-19 and are now going to give us the emergency use
[1:48:43.580 --> 1:48:48.940]  For these two messenger RNA. He was head of FDA
[1:48:49.580 --> 1:48:51.580]  in 2017
[1:48:51.660 --> 1:48:56.060]  When the uh department of health and human services of which he's apart
[1:48:56.860 --> 1:49:00.860]  Ended the pause letters on the gain of function
[1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:03.340]  Work at the unc
[1:49:03.980 --> 1:49:05.740]  BSl3
[1:49:05.740 --> 1:49:10.540]  Where the wuhan uh back Queen was and the FDA were
[1:49:10.540 --> 1:49:13.980]  Uh developing the the Covid-19
[1:49:14.940 --> 1:49:16.940]  uh by a warfare weapon
[1:49:17.260 --> 1:49:20.540]  If you read yesterday's uh, uh, uh, so, you know
[1:49:21.420 --> 1:49:23.900]  Gottlieb's an insider he knows what's going on here
[1:49:24.300 --> 1:49:29.100]  And he's signaling to all the boovers and shakers and the plutocrats
[1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:34.940]  Who read the wall street journal exactly what's going on if you read Gottlieb's uh, um
[1:49:35.740 --> 1:49:37.660]  essay yesterday
[1:49:37.660 --> 1:49:43.980]  First they're going to go after all the old people and they can easily track them down
[1:49:44.540 --> 1:49:51.980]  Be by means of their uh medicare card. That's right right and that means then they can kill them off first
[1:49:52.540 --> 1:49:56.780]  And they will not have to pay any more of their medicare benefits
[1:49:57.500 --> 1:50:03.900]  Then they're going to go after uh blacks and latinos and uh indigenous people
[1:50:03.900 --> 1:50:09.980]  They are going it's all in there. I sent you my analysis. I sent it to your assistant there Doria
[1:50:10.380 --> 1:50:14.380]  You can look at it right there. I go through it with all the quotations
[1:50:14.780 --> 1:50:16.940]  Then they're going to go after poor people
[1:50:17.740 --> 1:50:24.540]  They are going to go after uh homeless people and it's clear if you read through what Gottlieb is saying
[1:50:25.180 --> 1:50:32.620]  This is the nopsy philosophy of useless eaters at work that was condemned at the
[1:50:32.620 --> 1:50:39.180]  Nuremberg Tribunal itself and the main judgment in 1946
[1:50:39.580 --> 1:50:45.180]  That hitler and the noxies had their philosophy of useless eaters. They also made it clear
[1:50:45.900 --> 1:50:51.740]  Elsewhere they're going to be targeting uh disabled people who are mentally and physically
[1:50:52.380 --> 1:50:57.900]  Uh disabled that's how they write it. They say oh entrance groups latinos poor blacks
[1:50:57.900 --> 1:51:02.380]  Poor whites old people and bill gates goes older going to need five shots
[1:51:02.700 --> 1:51:08.140]  And then they and then he goes and 700 000 will get sick or die and then scening goes some are going to die get ready
[1:51:08.460 --> 1:51:10.460]  I mean, they're just getting ready to normalize
[1:51:11.180 --> 1:51:16.140]  Sharing these operations out against us. These are the member bill gates said don't take care of old people
[1:51:16.540 --> 1:51:20.700]  Euthanize them. We'll be back with hour number three dr. Francis Boyle
[1:51:21.660 --> 1:51:25.180]  Was a prestigious lawyer that wrote the us biological weapons law
[1:51:25.180 --> 1:51:28.460]  We are so honored to have him and what he's saying is I've spent
[1:51:29.180 --> 1:51:36.300]  Year studying this and and and days looking at each of these things. I mean this what he's saying is all on record. This is him

[1:52:43.580 --> 1:52:48.220]  And then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major robber barons the planet by the 1920s
[1:52:48.620 --> 1:52:50.620]  He's all about corporate global governance
[1:52:51.260 --> 1:52:55.100]  And now you're seeing hundreds of blue states the blue cities the communists and socialists
[1:52:55.420 --> 1:53:00.700]  Nations all working in unison under un-controlled established a medical planetary dictatorship
[1:53:01.180 --> 1:53:08.620]  At the core of it is the fortune 100 corporations themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families
[1:53:08.620 --> 1:53:15.180]  The Rothschilds the Rockefellers the dutch and british royalty being at the very heart of that then you learn the dutch and british royalty
[1:53:15.180 --> 1:53:17.180]  Aren't even dutch or british at the same time
[1:53:17.900 --> 1:53:24.220]  But they go back to the literal count gractula and the wars in between christendom and islam
[1:53:25.100 --> 1:53:27.100]  Those that don't know history really are
[1:53:27.740 --> 1:53:33.180]  Doomed to repeat it. They're involved in ploting the world economy. That's what the social distancing the master all about
[1:53:33.180 --> 1:53:38.700]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply or comply with your own destruction wake up
[1:53:38.700 --> 1:54:00.700]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:54:08.700 --> 1:54:23.100]  All right, this is a short segment long step coming up dr. Francis Boyle is our guest
[1:54:23.900 --> 1:54:27.500]  He's laying out these lawsuits filed in the eu you name it saying
[1:54:28.140 --> 1:54:34.860]  They admit the studies that are even limited. This could sterilize women cause autoimmune disorders super dangerous
[1:54:34.860 --> 1:54:39.260]  But the still the system's doing this. They're moving forward dr. Boyle continue place
[1:54:41.100 --> 1:54:48.460]  Right. Well, um, I gave my uh analysis of the got leave article to your uh assistant there doria
[1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:53.260]  And you have my permission to uh post that analysis on your web page
[1:54:53.820 --> 1:54:57.340]  The other point about got leave you have to understand
[1:54:58.300 --> 1:55:00.300]  Uh, first this is in the wall street journal
[1:55:00.300 --> 1:55:08.700]  So all the movers and the shakers and the plutocrats understand exactly what what the agenda here
[1:55:09.100 --> 1:55:13.740]  It's the implementation of the nazi philosophy of useless eaters
[1:55:14.220 --> 1:55:22.060]  Uh by means of violating the nuremberg code on medical experimentation with these uh franken shots
[1:55:22.460 --> 1:55:28.620]  Now the other point to keep in mind about uh got leave. Uh, he said well, he's uh an associate there
[1:55:28.620 --> 1:55:36.220]  At the american enterprise institute, right a e i is a haven and a knife nest
[1:55:36.860 --> 1:55:38.540]  for the, um
[1:55:38.540 --> 1:55:47.340]  Straussian neocons from the university of chicago, which we discussed before where i was educated in their program
[1:55:47.900 --> 1:55:57.180]  Leo all the the straussian neocons are all at a e i along with got leave and strauss's uh sponsored
[1:55:57.180 --> 1:56:01.180]  Uh in and and mentor in germany
[1:56:01.820 --> 1:56:03.820]  was carol schmitt
[1:56:04.220 --> 1:56:12.540]  The leading nazi law professor of that benighted era who justified every hideous atrocity
[1:56:13.100 --> 1:56:19.340]  Hitler and the nazis inflicted on everyone including the jews disabled
[1:56:20.620 --> 1:56:26.380]  Gay people roma and of course all the slavic people there in eastern europe
[1:56:26.380 --> 1:56:31.820]  Uh, we're we're you know exterminate so it's a survival of the fittest cult
[1:56:32.460 --> 1:56:37.420]  That that can of the rockfeller of the british into the nazis back to us and now it's here again
[1:56:38.540 --> 1:56:45.180]  Well, alex you you started out your program here with me just saying uh the that you know, uh
[1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:49.500]  85 years ago. We were dealing with the nazis
[1:56:49.500 --> 1:56:56.380]  Well, we're dealing with them again, but they are now us as pogo said
[1:56:56.940 --> 1:57:04.700]  And we've met the enemy and he is us and so we are seeing a cabal of people with a nazi mentality
[1:57:05.260 --> 1:57:07.260]  pursuing nazi
[1:57:07.900 --> 1:57:14.620]  Uh programs not only in the development of the covet 19, but then uh also with these
[1:57:14.620 --> 1:57:20.780]  Uh, uh, franken shots. There's no other word for it and just read my analysis of the
[1:57:22.060 --> 1:57:27.020]  Gottlieb article in yesterday's wall street journal where he prioritizes
[1:57:27.500 --> 1:57:31.020]  Who is going to be killed off first with these?
[1:57:31.580 --> 1:57:33.580]  extremely dangerous
[1:57:33.660 --> 1:57:35.660]  messenger RNA
[1:57:36.700 --> 1:57:43.420]  Shots, uh, they're they're going to be the winter bench right the youthless eaters. That's exactly right and then
[1:57:43.420 --> 1:57:45.420]  All the plutocrats there
[1:57:45.660 --> 1:57:51.420]  Uh on wall street to read the wall street journal, uh the banks everyone else
[1:57:51.980 --> 1:57:53.980]  They won't have to pay for them anymore
[1:57:54.220 --> 1:58:00.460]  All those benefits that that these people have gotten the taxes they've paid the hard work they've done
[1:58:00.940 --> 1:58:03.660]  The greatest generation now sitting in
[1:58:04.220 --> 1:58:05.420]  Holder just died
[1:58:05.420 --> 1:58:09.900]  All of that they admit by saying all this medical stuff is not essential the millions of dead
[1:58:09.900 --> 1:58:15.660]  They admit the european u.s. From non-treatment the insurance companies are all getting the money with those service see how that works
[1:58:17.020 --> 1:58:19.020]  Sure, it you know it
[1:58:19.660 --> 1:58:26.060]  It's all about big big money and population reduction, right? That's the article and and i just sent my
[1:58:26.700 --> 1:58:33.340]  Uh analysis of that article to your assistant and you can agree. Let's recap it and go through how we stop it with
[1:58:33.340 --> 1:58:42.620]  Our guest dr. Francis aboyle author of the u.s. Biological weapons law straight ahead pointing out that the phyzer mRNA vaccine is a bio weapon
[1:58:43.740 --> 1:58:45.740]  Joining one of others by
[1:58:47.180 --> 1:58:52.700]  Back in 1996 the head of the world food program said that they would use food
[1:58:53.260 --> 1:59:01.740]  And global lockdowns due to a virus gear to bring in world government that also came out the north american union
[1:59:01.740 --> 1:59:07.340]  Dr. Optimus the judicial watch and Lou Dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well
[1:59:07.580 --> 1:59:09.340]  So we know
[1:59:09.340 --> 1:59:13.820]  They're playing and if they're able to keep this lockdown going it's going to cause not just a worldwide depression
[1:59:14.140 --> 1:59:20.300]  But mass starvation of hundreds of millions millions have already starved to death not from covid but from the lockdown
[1:59:20.620 --> 1:59:24.940]  That's why it's important for people in north america to get prepared hell all over the world
[1:59:24.940 --> 1:59:31.660]  But we have high-quality swirled food ready to ship for you the last 25 years and prepare with alex dot com
[1:59:31.900 --> 1:59:34.380]  There's an additional 10 off a very rare sale
[1:59:34.620 --> 1:59:39.260]  It's going right now prepare with alex dot com also at info wars dot com
[1:59:39.500 --> 1:59:43.900]  We have all the great supplements that boost your immune system and so much more with free shipping as well
[1:59:43.900 --> 1:59:55.900]  Of a 60 off the big advantage of that at info or store.com and prepare with alex dot com
[1:59:59.580 --> 2:00:01.580]  All right one more segment with
[2:00:01.740 --> 2:00:06.860]  Dr. Francis Boyle then your phone calls coming up next segment ladies and gentlemen
[2:00:07.740 --> 2:00:11.820]  But he's the author of the us biological weapons law contributed major to the un world law
[2:00:11.820 --> 2:00:19.020]  He's saying it goes further than what dr. Wolfgang woodard and the big EU advisory board and the former chief scientist of fizer
[2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:24.540]  Is saying that this can sterilize you this can give you autoimmune disorders. This is just kill you
[2:00:24.780 --> 2:00:30.060]  He's saying it's probably worse than that. I mean, this isn't even a vaccine. This is a system that reprograms yourselves
[2:00:30.140 --> 2:00:34.700]  It's just and they're saying hey, it may kill you. It may hurt you. They want us to all accept now this new
[2:00:35.500 --> 2:00:39.500]  System and they're trying to say it's going to be mandatory and airlines are going to make you
[2:00:39.500 --> 2:00:42.540]  Uh do it. So we've got nine minutes left of this segment
[2:00:43.100 --> 2:00:44.300]  Dr. Boyle
[2:00:44.300 --> 2:00:47.180]  Lay it all out for people because I was interrupting some of you the great job
[2:00:47.420 --> 2:00:50.140]  But just the whole spectrum of what this is and what you think
[2:00:50.700 --> 2:00:55.580]  America's response should be what what president should trump should do. I think it's been bamboozled by this so far
[2:00:57.660 --> 2:01:03.900]  Well, I think we're going to have to resist these uh franken shots sure by all means if you have
[2:01:03.900 --> 2:01:10.860]  Parents in nursing homes, you're going to have to go in there and save them and make sure they don't get these shots
[2:01:11.260 --> 2:01:12.780]  They're going to be killed off
[2:01:12.780 --> 2:01:15.100]  that you know the greatest generation and indeed
[2:01:15.660 --> 2:01:20.780]  Some of my generation now the wood stock generation are in nursing homes. I hate to say it
[2:01:21.260 --> 2:01:23.660]  But you know the the senior citizens
[2:01:24.460 --> 2:01:26.460]  Are most at risk here
[2:01:26.940 --> 2:01:32.220]  And again, you started here the second world war. It's it's december 8th. My dad
[2:01:32.220 --> 2:01:33.660]  Uh
[2:01:33.660 --> 2:01:39.180]  went down to marine corps to marine corps headquarters in chicago and signed up for
[2:01:40.140 --> 2:01:45.420]  uh becoming the uh marine corps officer candidate to fight japan
[2:01:45.900 --> 2:01:50.700]  That is what we are in here. Uh, you were corrected in your opening statement
[2:01:51.260 --> 2:01:55.900]  We are in uh, as I said before, uh, elix world war three here
[2:01:55.900 --> 2:02:03.900]  Uh against covet 19 and now against these, uh, nazi uh franken shots. Yeah, it's it's a full scale
[2:02:04.780 --> 2:02:06.300]  attack
[2:02:06.300 --> 2:02:09.420]  Not on the wealthy people not on the plutocrats
[2:02:10.220 --> 2:02:12.700]  Not on the you know the people calling the shots
[2:02:13.100 --> 2:02:16.940]  But all the rest of us right and that's why i'm here today. Sorry couldn't go on
[2:02:17.580 --> 2:02:22.220]  Last week. I was tied up and this is the first chance. I've had since you
[2:02:22.220 --> 2:02:28.540]  Uh asked me out. That's that's what is facing us. Um as human beings and
[2:02:28.940 --> 2:02:31.740]  Certainly as citizens of the united states of america
[2:02:32.300 --> 2:02:41.260]  Where this all came out of covet 19 the u.n.c. Uh, uh bsl three and now the uh fda giving this
[2:02:41.740 --> 2:02:43.740]  completely bogus of
[2:02:44.300 --> 2:02:45.580]  emergency
[2:02:45.580 --> 2:02:51.580]  Authorization in clear cut violations of nuremberg code on medical experimentation
[2:02:51.580 --> 2:02:53.580]  And which we've already litigated
[2:02:54.220 --> 2:03:01.260]  In the uh court marshal of captain dr. Yolanda huard vaughn for the experimental
[2:03:01.980 --> 2:03:04.620]  anti-bio warfare vaccines for
[2:03:05.820 --> 2:03:07.820]  Uh for anthrax and botanism
[2:03:07.900 --> 2:03:11.420]  There is no vaccine that is going to work on covet 19
[2:03:11.900 --> 2:03:14.140]  Indeed if if you study the matter
[2:03:14.780 --> 2:03:17.180]  After uh barric and the rest of them
[2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:22.540]  Um, uh developed uh covet 19 there at the u.n.c. BSL three
[2:03:23.100 --> 2:03:25.100]  They did not even bother
[2:03:25.580 --> 2:03:31.900]  To to deal with a vaccine because they knew it wasn't going to work. And so they immediately moved into
[2:03:32.780 --> 2:03:36.860]  Remdesivir, okay, and we can discuss remdesivir all you want
[2:03:37.420 --> 2:03:45.180]  But they knew the vaccine was not going to work. I don't see how any vaccine is going to work here with covet 19
[2:03:45.180 --> 2:03:50.540]  As you correctly pointed out, we've spent a generation trying to get a vaccine for cancer
[2:03:50.860 --> 2:03:55.900]  We still don't have one. We know covet 19 has uh hiv
[2:03:56.540 --> 2:04:03.180]  DNA genetically engineered in there. We don't have a vaccine to uh prevent hiv
[2:04:03.740 --> 2:04:07.100]  So, um, you know, this is a pie in the sky
[2:04:07.660 --> 2:04:09.660]  It it is genocidal
[2:04:09.660 --> 2:04:16.540]  Uh, and they're all making money out of it now to be fair barric apparently has just decided to get back into vaccines
[2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:18.940]  Because there's money to be made
[2:04:19.020 --> 2:04:22.940]  So, okay, but right after uh, uh, that was the case
[2:04:23.660 --> 2:04:31.820]  They moved immediately into remdesivir. They did not move into a vaccine because I knew that I think they they realized that it was hopeless
[2:04:32.300 --> 2:04:35.980]  And by the way, now we're seeing on tv got leave running around
[2:04:35.980 --> 2:04:41.580]  Uh, and trying to pawn off these vaccines. We are seeing a full court
[2:04:42.140 --> 2:04:43.180]  press
[2:04:43.180 --> 2:04:47.980]  across the board if you go back to that tabletop exercise
[2:04:48.540 --> 2:04:55.100]  Uh, uh, october 2019 paid for by gates. You will see that they've already planned
[2:04:55.740 --> 2:04:59.420]  Uh to roll out their propaganda campaign here
[2:04:59.980 --> 2:05:04.220]  uh, that tabletop exercise is really a
[2:05:04.220 --> 2:05:07.820]  Uh euphemism for a war plan and a war game
[2:05:08.220 --> 2:05:14.140]  Uh, they didn't want to call it that but that's really what it was and when the trump's biggest failure
[2:05:15.420 --> 2:05:20.620]  Uh is going along with event 201 and and buying into it thinking it would fix the economy and end the lockdown
[2:05:20.700 --> 2:05:26.460]  No, they now say oh the lockdown doesn't end and it doesn't even even even phyzer and modern have said
[2:05:26.860 --> 2:05:30.460]  This probably won't protect you from infection and won't stop you spreading it
[2:05:30.460 --> 2:05:36.220]  Well, what the hell kind of vaccine is that when they're telling us like you said on the show 10 months ago
[2:05:36.700 --> 2:05:41.660]  You were on here 10 months ago or nine and a half months ago. You said it will not work. How does you know that dr. Boyle?
[2:05:42.780 --> 2:05:50.220]  By studying it, uh, it's that simple and based on uh previous experience with the anthrax and uh, botulin
[2:05:51.180 --> 2:05:52.380]  uh
[2:05:52.380 --> 2:05:55.660]  vaccines and having dealt that with had a great length
[2:05:55.660 --> 2:06:01.980]  in our defense of captain dr. You had won and as a matter of fact, uh, the uh court marshall there
[2:06:02.460 --> 2:06:10.140]  Was so bad afterwards. I came out and had a press conference in front of satellite dishes and I accused president bush
[2:06:10.780 --> 2:06:13.980]  uh, cheney, uh, the he was secretary of defense
[2:06:14.460 --> 2:06:21.900]  Uh, uh, colon pal and schwarzkoff of committing a nirnberg crime on our own troops that went out nationwide
[2:06:21.900 --> 2:06:27.500]  It even went to the white house. I was told by a lawyer there. They're all shaken up
[2:06:27.820 --> 2:06:30.620]  Well, let's be clear. Yeah, it's not about credit. It's true
[2:06:31.100 --> 2:06:36.940]  You did that others did that you were the tip of the spear then that got those secret programs and programs cancelled for a while
[2:06:37.260 --> 2:06:38.540]  We need this again
[2:06:38.540 --> 2:06:42.860]  They're trying to get everyone to stampede and beg for the vaccine get everything waived by trump
[2:06:43.180 --> 2:06:46.860]  Trump's biggest failure was agreeing to this. I understand he was trying to counter biden
[2:06:46.860 --> 2:06:52.380]  But it's a horrible mistake. Trump made he's out right now pushing this damn warp speed and uh,
[2:06:52.780 --> 2:06:57.260]  Notice they try to hedge their bets they go. Oh if there is death is because trump sped it up
[2:06:57.580 --> 2:06:59.820]  I think trump's been set up by this dr. Boyle
[2:07:01.180 --> 2:07:07.180]  Well, let me go back. So after I had done this then senator j rockefellow held hearings
[2:07:07.740 --> 2:07:11.420]  uh on the uh vaccines and at the end of the hearings
[2:07:11.420 --> 2:07:18.460]  He also agreed with me and publicly stated bush and the rest of them had inflicted a nuremberg crime
[2:07:18.860 --> 2:07:23.260]  On our own troops by forcing and so we need that again. So how important is what?
[2:07:23.980 --> 2:07:25.980]  Obviously, you probably need to help professor
[2:07:26.540 --> 2:07:31.020]  Professor you probably need to help wolf came woodard and this other fizer scientist
[2:07:31.420 --> 2:07:37.020]  Because you know, they're trying to file stuff that with your expertise. They're doing the right thing filing emergency injunctions
[2:07:37.340 --> 2:07:39.340]  Is that accurate?
[2:07:39.340 --> 2:07:44.540]  Well, I I haven't read a lawsuit yet being filed in an american court
[2:07:44.940 --> 2:07:48.780]  But yes, I'm willing to offer my services free of charge
[2:07:49.420 --> 2:07:54.300]  As I did to captain huid vaughn for any uh lawyers out there
[2:07:55.180 --> 2:07:56.620]  willing to
[2:07:56.620 --> 2:08:02.620]  Enjoy the uh distribution of these vaccines and especially to stop uh, fda, right?
[2:08:03.100 --> 2:08:07.980]  They just have to contact me and uh, we can put something uh together
[2:08:07.980 --> 2:08:11.100]  Well, that's wonderful in closing. I want to thank you for your long service for humanity
[2:08:11.100 --> 2:08:16.700]  Don't just america dr. Boyle, but seriously every day. There's two or three top microbiologists heads of universities
[2:08:16.940 --> 2:08:23.260]  Head scientist government advisors. Look at this guy top microbiologist says cova vaccine downright dangerous will shin you to your doom
[2:08:23.740 --> 2:08:25.900]  This is this is on fox news. I mean
[2:08:27.020 --> 2:08:30.780]  Everybody's warning except the big pharma crazies. It's like
[2:08:31.900 --> 2:08:36.940]  Deep water horizon when they ordered them to dump water into the hole set a concrete the engineers said it's gonna blow up
[2:08:36.940 --> 2:08:42.700]  And the and the executive said I don't care. We'll say 45 million dollars. I mean, these are crazy people. What are they doing?
[2:08:43.660 --> 2:08:49.340]  This is a Nazi mentality. Alex. We've we've you've studied you you've studied history. I've studied history
[2:08:49.580 --> 2:08:55.900]  I told you I went through the exact same uh program at harvard that produced kissinger before me the
[2:08:56.220 --> 2:09:00.140]  Harvard graduate school of arts and sciences department of government
[2:09:00.140 --> 2:09:08.540]  Specializing international relations and they gave me kissinger's old office there at harvard center for international affairs
[2:09:09.020 --> 2:09:16.860]  That's what people like kissinger are trained to do at harvard. And by the way, harvard was involved

[2:10:54.220 --> 2:10:59.340]  That's their stated admitted plan. Justin Trudeau's on record claus swab all the different democrat mayors
[2:10:59.500 --> 2:11:03.740]  They admit it's clowered in heaven implode the economy to make us go into their control
[2:11:03.740 --> 2:11:07.100]  But if we expose they're the ones doing it they go to prison
[2:11:07.420 --> 2:11:12.380]  Instead of getting total power and total control and there are major uprisings happening across the world
[2:11:12.620 --> 2:11:17.340]  During the us thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns people are finally starting to fight back
[2:11:17.740 --> 2:11:19.740]  But regardless you need to get prepared

[2:12:15.580 --> 2:12:17.580]  Oh
[2:12:27.500 --> 2:12:29.500]  This is the takeover of the united states
[2:12:30.300 --> 2:12:32.300]  i'm just talking to one of my friends whose buddies
[2:12:33.420 --> 2:12:37.740]  In the army in the green berets and they're up in utah right now being brainwashed that all whites are racist
[2:12:38.140 --> 2:12:40.540]  And america's bad the guy's been in the military 20 years
[2:12:40.540 --> 2:12:45.980]  I mean trump ordered that stop they didn't stop it. They do what they want. That's why trump isn't so much trouble
[2:12:45.980 --> 2:12:48.620]  It's why we're in trouble is we have a mutiny going on
[2:12:48.620 --> 2:12:52.940]  But here's the good news people are waking up to a texas case break selection wide open
[2:12:53.340 --> 2:12:57.740]  Turns tide to trump's favor big article by kit daniels at info wars.com
[2:12:58.140 --> 2:13:02.460]  So say to texas saying you don't have a right to violate the constitution and violate our voters
[2:13:02.940 --> 2:13:05.340]  Because when you steal those states you steal texas voters
[2:13:05.900 --> 2:13:07.900]  damn right
[2:13:07.900 --> 2:13:13.260]  Folks we cannot let joe biden get in. He's a chinese communist asian even if he won
[2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:16.620]  I'd say he won, but he's illegitimate, but he didn't win. He stole it
[2:13:17.420 --> 2:13:23.340]  And you've all seen the evidence. You don't need me to swear up and down to you. That's the case. My god. I can't even cover it
[2:13:23.340 --> 2:13:25.340]  It's like a freaking fire hose
[2:13:25.900 --> 2:13:29.340]  Trying to drink out of a fire hose. I can get one cup of it two cups ten cups
[2:13:29.820 --> 2:13:31.820]  I'm just like
[2:13:31.820 --> 2:13:33.420]  They stole this
[2:13:33.420 --> 2:13:35.420]  Out in the open naked at high noon, man
[2:13:35.420 --> 2:13:37.420]  Let's go to your phone calls
[2:13:41.180 --> 2:13:43.580]  Let's go to george in chicago. You're on the air
[2:13:45.260 --> 2:13:48.060]  Love you. Alex. Thank you for having me on love you brother. Go ahead
[2:13:48.940 --> 2:13:51.660]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that the same way trump, uh
[2:13:52.540 --> 2:13:58.140]  Phone's a fraud a couple days back. He's got to do the same with this. You've got to he's got to say, hey, we're a separate
[2:13:58.700 --> 2:14:00.140]  republic
[2:14:00.140 --> 2:14:01.340]  and uh
[2:14:01.340 --> 2:14:03.340]  you know, we have to
[2:14:03.340 --> 2:14:08.220]  Actually, he stopped his goblins timing his takeover and the way we're going to do that is
[2:14:08.860 --> 2:14:13.020]  Insurrection act whatever presidential tool he has at his disposal. He's got to do it out
[2:14:13.740 --> 2:14:17.100]  The FBI is not going to arrest any chinese agents. They have all the evidence
[2:14:17.340 --> 2:14:20.300]  He's he's going to have to have the states do it bold moves
[2:14:20.300 --> 2:14:24.860]  He's going to have to just call out the american people and say I need 10 million of you to come to dc
[2:14:25.180 --> 2:14:30.620]  We're not accepting this fraud. We want the arrest of joe biden. It'll happen. They'll roll over the minute we show power
[2:14:30.620 --> 2:14:33.180]  The minute we show will it's over
[2:14:34.300 --> 2:14:36.620]  Exactly and at this point
[2:14:37.420 --> 2:14:42.860]  You know, the general public the good talk of the general public has already been convinced that all he's a dictator by the globalist
[2:14:43.500 --> 2:14:48.940]  And at this point it's not about reputation. If i'm trump, i'm starting to crack the balls here, you know, i'm going down swinging
[2:14:49.740 --> 2:14:51.740]  Well, here's the deal it's not even going
[2:14:51.820 --> 2:14:57.180]  All the cards are against them if we just finally go because all the libertarians are like well, we can't declare marshal law
[2:14:57.180 --> 2:15:03.340]  I mean that's illegal. We're already under globalist marshal law through the bureaucracy through the blue states
[2:15:03.740 --> 2:15:05.180]  And so the
[2:15:05.180 --> 2:15:11.900]  Common law says if you are under occupation and a foreign enemy's taking your cities and you only got a few cities left
[2:15:12.220 --> 2:15:16.700]  You don't follow the regular due law taking those cities back. It's a foreign damn enemy
[2:15:16.780 --> 2:15:20.780]  You remove them then you reinstate the law and of course it will do that
[2:15:21.340 --> 2:15:23.020]  Instead. Oh, no
[2:15:23.020 --> 2:15:29.580]  We're being overrun by the globalists instead and gonna lose everything because of people rearranging deck chairs on the titanic. Thank you
[2:15:30.220 --> 2:15:33.500]  Uh, who's up next here dabbing in new jersey. Go ahead
[2:15:34.940 --> 2:15:36.940]  Merry christmas all um
[2:15:37.100 --> 2:15:40.700]  Alex, I love president trump and I don't always agree with everything he does either
[2:15:41.500 --> 2:15:45.020]  But I would have the ultimate respect for him if he appeared daily on info wars
[2:15:45.740 --> 2:15:50.540]  And natural news and spoke about the current war we're in with china the election fraud
[2:15:50.540 --> 2:15:53.980]  The china virus fraud and big pharma fraud
[2:15:54.380 --> 2:15:57.260]  No, I agree. He's just trying to look confident keep the stock market up
[2:15:57.500 --> 2:16:03.900]  We're in a total crisis george washington would level with the people and he still got 43 days to do it
[2:16:05.180 --> 2:16:08.860]  Well, we need to expose the truth and when people
[2:16:10.380 --> 2:16:12.380]  Have nothing else to lose
[2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:17.500]  They're gonna stand up and fight
[2:16:17.500 --> 2:16:21.820]  I know and you're crying because you're not scared. Are you debbie? You're scared of what you're gonna do, aren't you?
[2:16:22.940 --> 2:16:24.540]  I'm not and
[2:16:24.540 --> 2:16:26.540]  I've lost some family
[2:16:27.020 --> 2:16:29.020]  during all this
[2:16:29.580 --> 2:16:31.580]  And I want to see people be strong
[2:16:34.060 --> 2:16:39.020]  I hear you sweetheart. We love you. We appreciate you and trump's trying as good as he can none of us are perfect
[2:16:39.340 --> 2:16:42.460]  But this is one hell of a war and you know if they're trying to take america down
[2:16:42.460 --> 2:16:48.460]  And it's just it's it's we're gonna generations are gonna look back on this moment and that's what we did. It's just such an incredible time
[2:16:48.460 --> 2:16:50.060]  Thank you so much for the call
[2:16:50.060 --> 2:16:51.740]  beautiful call
[2:16:51.740 --> 2:16:55.500]  This is a big deal folks. This isn't just another party getting power. I would care less it was
[2:16:56.140 --> 2:16:59.740]  Democrats from 40 years ago. It's it's not these are chinese communist agents
[2:17:01.100 --> 2:17:06.140]  They tend to gut our borders bringing all the islamic hordes. I mean they're gonna break us. You know that right?
[2:17:06.780 --> 2:17:10.140]  The foot's never coming off your neck folks. So give it in doesn't get you ahead
[2:17:10.140 --> 2:17:16.220]  We were living off what other people did for decades and now the gas is out of the tank folks
[2:17:21.260 --> 2:17:23.900]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here
[2:17:24.700 --> 2:17:26.700]  who's been holding the longest
[2:17:27.260 --> 2:17:29.260]  that would be
[2:17:30.220 --> 2:17:32.220]  Resistance in new york go ahead
[2:17:32.220 --> 2:17:38.940]  Hey, Alex, how you doing there man? I'm I'm pretty excited. It's gonna be edge of my seat. What about you?
[2:17:40.300 --> 2:17:45.260]  Ah, I'm hoping to get down. See I'm dealing with whatever I'm dealing with
[2:17:45.820 --> 2:17:48.860]  But you know, it's nothing compared to what we're all facing here
[2:17:50.620 --> 2:17:55.660]  That's right, brother. What's your view on trump and marshal law and where we are because we're under globalist marshal law
[2:17:55.660 --> 2:17:57.180]  What are we gonna do about it?
[2:17:57.180 --> 2:18:00.780]  Oh, I was thinking if it's within trump's purview
[2:18:00.780 --> 2:18:02.780]  To sanction a volunteer
[2:18:04.140 --> 2:18:06.140]  to the u.s. Marshals
[2:18:06.380 --> 2:18:13.820]  This way, you know, just recruit us and we could carry out arrests run protection for witnesses during hearings lawyers
[2:18:14.860 --> 2:18:19.100]  The problem is infiltrate that. I mean, yeah, he needs to that's why he's going back to the military
[2:18:19.340 --> 2:18:23.660]  I mean, we have Chinese agents globalist agents. They've undermined us and all we've got to do is
[2:18:23.660 --> 2:18:29.660]  Is is is arrest or go after a few top people they're gonna roll over but we never fight back is a problem
[2:18:30.940 --> 2:18:34.460]  Yeah, well, I mean who would carry it out. That's that's what I'm thinking
[2:18:35.900 --> 2:18:39.260]  I mean imagine we've had freedom and due process. We've had problems
[2:18:39.340 --> 2:18:42.460]  But for so long people don't know how to deal with foreign takeover
[2:18:42.940 --> 2:18:45.420]  I mean, this is marshal law shutdown
[2:18:45.980 --> 2:18:47.980]  bankrupting the country
[2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:53.020]  And our police are some of the best trained following orders out there. They're not gonna save us. They're not leaders
[2:18:53.020 --> 2:18:55.580]  It's up to us and it's up to president trump
[2:18:56.220 --> 2:18:58.220]  So I I mean, I don't know. What do you because look listen
[2:18:59.020 --> 2:19:01.820]  They know we're awake. They know they've lost the people
[2:19:02.300 --> 2:19:04.300]  so they're gonna come in with
[2:19:04.460 --> 2:19:11.580]  Gaslighting and oppression the lives in which we've never seen. I mean it's hell is waiting on the other side. That's all I could say
[2:19:12.620 --> 2:19:16.140]  Yeah, for sure. That's why I'm thinking of a way to really empower us
[2:19:17.180 --> 2:19:18.380]  to
[2:19:18.380 --> 2:19:20.380]  carry this stuff out
[2:19:20.380 --> 2:19:25.580]  You know on our own a certain point, you know, look at texas following the lawsuits and look at other states need to say
[2:19:26.620 --> 2:19:30.700]  We don't we're not agreeing with this and the states have a special legislative session
[2:19:31.180 --> 2:19:34.540]  And they have their own electors and we elect trump. It's an exercise of power
[2:19:34.860 --> 2:19:41.340]  We saw the fraud you did. We repudiated CNN and MSNBC. We're putting trump in it comes down to
[2:19:42.060 --> 2:19:44.300]  What does 20 Montana say? There's two things
[2:19:45.100 --> 2:19:47.900]  In this world, he won't break for anybody. It's his word and his balls
[2:19:47.900 --> 2:19:51.180]  And there's one thing gives orders and balls in about between your legs
[2:19:51.260 --> 2:19:55.500]  But what's in your heart? It means that at a certain point we've been getting pushed around forever
[2:19:55.740 --> 2:19:59.180]  And so now we're about to get pushed over the edge of the cliff. We don't finally say no
[2:19:59.660 --> 2:20:02.540]  So it's up to the states to do it trump is surrounded
[2:20:02.940 --> 2:20:10.060]  It's up to what texas just did and others just did all the states that you declared now for america against the chai comms
[2:20:10.060 --> 2:20:11.340]  What do you say?
[2:20:11.340 --> 2:20:13.340]  Reclamation of independence
[2:20:13.340 --> 2:20:19.660]  Damn, my brother you fixed it from declaration of reclamation. Let's do it. I agree with you. Yes, sir
[2:20:19.980 --> 2:20:22.620]  I bless you one make no mistake. Ladies and gentlemen
[2:20:23.100 --> 2:20:26.460]  And you know, I predicted all this it wasn't hard to do. I'm telling you
[2:20:27.580 --> 2:20:29.580]  If you don't take action now
[2:20:29.580 --> 2:20:31.900]  You're gonna beg later. You would have taken action
[2:20:31.900 --> 2:20:43.420]  But they get that piece of monster in there. They are gonna slice us up a thousand ways. Get ready for war. Stay with us
[2:20:45.020 --> 2:20:47.500]  The globalist and their minions want to play god
[2:20:48.460 --> 2:20:51.100]  Chucky Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama
[2:20:51.580 --> 2:20:56.860]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think why do they hate humanity so much? Why do they love death?
[2:20:57.660 --> 2:20:59.660]  Because they hate themselves
[2:20:59.660 --> 2:21:01.660]  They project their own
[2:21:02.300 --> 2:21:05.420]  Disgust with their soul on to us
[2:21:06.140 --> 2:21:10.860]  And once you understand that basic psychological point every other answer is completely clear
[2:21:11.420 --> 2:21:16.460]  That's why they hate info wars. We believe in humanity. We think you're beautiful. We think you're amazing
[2:21:17.180 --> 2:21:19.180]  Info wars knows you're fallen
[2:21:19.420 --> 2:21:22.060]  But that you have god's potential that god gave you
[2:21:22.540 --> 2:21:25.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here. It's now upon us
[2:21:25.820 --> 2:21:31.820]  I want to encourage you all spread the word about info wars down more than ever when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth
[2:21:32.380 --> 2:21:35.180]  We know you're gonna override these globalists. We know you're gonna defeat them
[2:21:35.260 --> 2:21:38.060]  I just want to salute you all for your action everything you've already done
[2:21:38.540 --> 2:21:41.580]  Because god's on our side and the globalists know it
[2:21:44.220 --> 2:21:47.100]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional
[2:21:47.500 --> 2:21:51.340]  criminal lockdowns directed by the communist chinese and the united nations
[2:21:51.340 --> 2:21:58.460]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient the worst australian models of complete lockdowns
[2:21:58.540 --> 2:22:01.900]  So you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced
[2:22:02.300 --> 2:22:08.300]  And in germany the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men women and children
[2:22:08.540 --> 2:22:12.220]  That protests the fact that merkle the dictator has put them under her control
[2:22:12.620 --> 2:22:18.860]  That's right. She's been ringing elections for years and years and the same thing is coming here to the united states
[2:22:18.860 --> 2:22:24.780]  This is world government in philadelphia. They've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested
[2:22:25.020 --> 2:22:27.020]  They're announcing the christmas is canceled
[2:22:27.100 --> 2:22:33.500]  This is what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you to take rid of all your due process and absolutely
[2:22:33.900 --> 2:22:40.220]  Transform the world into a prison planet. How long have we warned you about this? But you can fight back
[2:22:40.540 --> 2:22:43.340]  america is the last bastion stop submitting
[2:22:43.340 --> 2:22:49.180]  Fox has betrayed president trump as i predicted that they would they've always been
[2:22:49.580 --> 2:22:54.220]  Part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse if they're able to keep trump from
[2:22:54.540 --> 2:22:56.540]  Rightfully taking office for second term
[2:22:57.020 --> 2:23:03.660]  Ontario 20th the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices
[2:23:03.980 --> 2:23:08.140]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to us
[2:23:08.140 --> 2:23:13.820]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic war
[2:23:14.140 --> 2:23:19.340]  We're being consolidated. We're being taken over the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states
[2:23:19.820 --> 2:23:23.900]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them
[2:23:24.300 --> 2:23:31.020]  Absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property. This gives a monopolistic takeover
[2:23:31.020 --> 2:23:35.020]  That's what's a great reset is claus schwaab and these other criminals admit it
[2:23:35.020 --> 2:23:40.060]  That's what social distancing is so your business is only 25 percent for several more years
[2:23:40.380 --> 2:23:44.220]  No small businesses will be there. This is a master plan. Say no
[2:23:46.940 --> 2:23:49.660]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:49.660 --> 2:24:07.180]  Stop the communist party of china slaging war on corruption
[2:24:07.660 --> 2:24:12.860]  It's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:24:13.420 --> 2:24:15.420]  All right, jason jones a major author
[2:24:15.420 --> 2:24:20.620]  A major filmmaker with international awards the father of seven grandfather of two
[2:24:21.100 --> 2:24:25.900]  And he escaped the police state of aliyah to come to texas. We're glad to have him in central texas
[2:24:26.460 --> 2:24:32.620]  And there's a lot of big events coming up thursday friday saturday sunday everyone go to dc now i'm trying to get there thursday for his event
[2:24:33.420 --> 2:24:36.620]  Which i asked me a part of then i got a bunch of stuff going on we're leaving thursday to get there
[2:24:37.020 --> 2:24:39.180]  But stop the ccp slave camps
[2:24:39.180 --> 2:24:45.180]  Designate the ccp as a transnational criminal organization, which trumps trying to do with bills
[2:24:45.660 --> 2:24:50.060]  That apple is opposing when apple's on record running some of the worst slave camps in
[2:24:50.620 --> 2:24:52.620]  communist china now imagine if trump
[2:24:53.660 --> 2:24:55.660]  Had a thousand muslim men
[2:24:56.380 --> 2:25:01.420]  In a camp and was taking their organs. I would say remove trump because we can't become what we're fighting
[2:25:01.900 --> 2:25:07.180]  But the Uyghurs are not offensively attacking the Uyghurs are what i've called, you know, really tame muslims
[2:25:07.180 --> 2:25:12.540]  But i don't care if they're buddhist christians agnostics catholics, whatever you don't kill them
[2:25:13.180 --> 2:25:19.100]  And this is a great evil and a great lispus test for the left that you don't hear a damn word
[2:25:19.100 --> 2:25:21.660]  You've seen the video a lot of you went viral millions of years
[2:25:22.620 --> 2:25:27.260]  They snipped out of me just pulling a guy's mask off now. I was like the Uyghurs three million in slave camps
[2:25:27.260 --> 2:25:32.140]  It's wrong. He was like f you laughing go on come on come on down here when i was up in the armored truck
[2:25:32.380 --> 2:25:34.860]  By the w hotel where the mayor is it's ordered lockdowns
[2:25:34.860 --> 2:25:37.820]  But you know flies around with his family without a mask and has big parties
[2:25:38.220 --> 2:25:41.100]  So i went down to talk to the guy and he was big smart ass so i pulled his mask off
[2:25:41.180 --> 2:25:42.860]  I should have done it was adrenaline
[2:25:42.860 --> 2:25:45.340]  But i wanted to like let him know that he's not going to be anonymous
[2:25:45.580 --> 2:25:48.220]  But but but the point is he was making you know again
[2:25:49.020 --> 2:25:51.420]  I'm going to kick your ass type type motions and threats
[2:25:51.820 --> 2:25:53.900]  But but that this makes me really mad that
[2:25:54.380 --> 2:25:58.700]  That they claim they're so liberal and so loving all day, but this is a big deal
[2:25:58.940 --> 2:26:03.980]  And so it's it's bad what's happening to the Uyghurs over there, but what does it say about our elites over here?
[2:26:03.980 --> 2:26:08.140]  So jason jones movie to movement calm the great campaign dot org
[2:26:08.540 --> 2:26:13.260]  The jason jones show people can find it jason jones, but but tell us about the big event the updates
[2:26:13.500 --> 2:26:17.020]  What's happening the Uyghurs? Thank god we're starting to learn about this. It's a big deal
[2:26:18.300 --> 2:26:24.140]  Alex well you you and your audience have been the the loudest voice in the world for the Uyghur and other people in chinese
[2:26:24.380 --> 2:26:29.500]  Occupied East turkistan december 10th is international human rights day the left
[2:26:29.500 --> 2:26:35.260]  Uh proclaims to passionately care about human rights although they've supported all of the major
[2:26:35.740 --> 2:26:40.460]  Oh human rights abusers in the past century, but on december 10
[2:26:41.260 --> 2:26:45.420]  From 11 to 1 we're going to be in washington dc on constitution avenue
[2:26:45.900 --> 2:26:50.620]  We're going to be there with Uyghurs casics the Tibetans the free hong kong movement
[2:26:51.100 --> 2:26:55.100]  We're going to march together against the ccp, which is the real virus
[2:26:55.900 --> 2:26:57.500]  and
[2:26:57.500 --> 2:26:59.420]  you know
[2:26:59.420 --> 2:27:04.140]  It's not just that there's this horrible thing happening on the other side of the world
[2:27:04.380 --> 2:27:10.220]  We now know because congressional staffers have been calling the press saying why is apple
[2:27:10.780 --> 2:27:11.900]  Why is knighty?
[2:27:11.900 --> 2:27:20.380]  Why is casco sending lobbyists into our office to weaken and gut the Uyghur forced labor protection act
[2:27:20.860 --> 2:27:22.860]  and all this act says
[2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:24.940]  is if you
[2:27:24.940 --> 2:27:26.940]  have your products made
[2:27:26.940 --> 2:27:30.380]  And chinese occupied east turkistan
[2:27:30.780 --> 2:27:37.020]  They just have to be certified that they were not made by forced slave labor. Why?
[2:27:38.700 --> 2:27:42.860]  Can you believe knighty is spending money on high-priced lobbyists?
[2:27:43.340 --> 2:27:46.780]  But walk the corridors of power. Well, that's why they fund black lives matter
[2:27:46.940 --> 2:27:52.460]  Which calls for the end of the nuclear family destroy black families because it's all just their sick cover what they're really doing
[2:27:52.620 --> 2:27:54.620]  These people are the modern nazis
[2:27:54.620 --> 2:28:01.180]  No, they really are and that's alice you hit the nail on the head what really scares me while we're going to be there on december 10
[2:28:02.140 --> 2:28:04.540]  Those concentration camps in nazi germany
[2:28:05.020 --> 2:28:08.860]  They were a lot of death in those camps prior to 1943
[2:28:09.420 --> 2:28:17.100]  But in 1943 after the wincy conference the concentration camps with death in them became death camps
[2:28:17.740 --> 2:28:19.340]  satellite footage
[2:28:19.340 --> 2:28:24.620]  There is now satellite footage of crematoriums being built outside of these concentration camps
[2:28:24.860 --> 2:28:28.060]  Look at this if you're not going to cry. This is not going to break your heart
[2:28:28.700 --> 2:28:32.620]  And you know what? I have products right here probably I look at my phone
[2:28:32.860 --> 2:28:37.340]  Alex I look at my phone and I wonder who looked at this phone who assembled this phone
[2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:41.580]  Who put this phone in the box? At least you're thinking about it and you're calling for the root of it to stop exactly
[2:28:42.380 --> 2:28:47.020]  But I give those don't know it's thousands of men out of the millions that are there being taken to be executed
[2:28:47.020 --> 2:28:50.060]  This has all been confirmed by the australian government research
[2:28:50.940 --> 2:28:57.660]  And then whoever valiantly inside the chinese government leaked the footage of this of thousands of men every week organized
[2:28:58.060 --> 2:29:02.380]  Bandanas you know hoods over their heads before they're executed and their organs harvested
[2:29:04.140 --> 2:29:09.500]  Yeah, there are heroes within china fighting to get this information out han chinese
[2:29:10.140 --> 2:29:13.980]  Uh smuggling out this information of what's happening to the Uyghur, you know
[2:29:13.980 --> 2:29:22.140]  We're our enemy is the ccp the the the greatest victim of the ccp is of course the chinese people the greatest victims of isis were muslims
[2:29:22.700 --> 2:29:27.100]  And um, but we want to stand shoulder to shoulder with those heroes
[2:29:27.820 --> 2:29:29.820]  um living in china
[2:29:29.980 --> 2:29:33.100]  Those heroes living in those concentration camps
[2:29:33.340 --> 2:29:37.980]  We want to stand shoulder to shoulder with them if we can break those brands nike
[2:29:37.980 --> 2:29:44.860]  Costco if we can force apple to say we support the Uyghur slave labor protection act
[2:29:45.180 --> 2:29:49.420]  We are no longer and why would tim cook not do that? It's disgusting
[2:29:51.660 --> 2:29:56.620]  You know, you can't imagine it. I can't imagine it. You've been saying for now decades. This is a prison planet
[2:29:57.180 --> 2:29:59.180]  You know, we are all in the same boat
[2:29:59.420 --> 2:30:01.420]  and uh
[2:30:01.420 --> 2:30:03.980]  You know the the plague of they told us in the 90s
[2:30:03.980 --> 2:30:09.180]  When they were fighting to give china permanent most favorite nation status, which they eventually did in 2000
[2:30:09.420 --> 2:30:11.420]  The china would become more like us
[2:30:11.740 --> 2:30:16.220]  What we have seen is we are becoming more like china and as you know in carol quickley's book
[2:30:16.940 --> 2:30:22.060]  uh from the 60s um tragedy and hope he talked about how china is really the model and
[2:30:22.540 --> 2:30:25.980]  The enemy uh to their aspirations is the american middle class
[2:30:26.140 --> 2:30:28.140]  so
[2:30:28.140 --> 2:30:34.300]  Ping was in an article a few months ago in the la times. It was praising him about gz ping, you know, the chinese emperor
[2:30:34.700 --> 2:30:39.420]  And how he he's it was speeches of him saying i will defeat american democracy
[2:30:39.500 --> 2:30:43.420]  I will show them they are a failure and i mean this is ridiculous
[2:30:45.340 --> 2:30:51.660]  You know, but what they don't count on with the chinese uh intelligence apparatus cannot count on we just uh, we saw the leak
[2:30:52.300 --> 2:30:54.140]  Professor with his speech
[2:30:54.140 --> 2:30:58.700]  Uh, I I didn't believe it was real. I sent it to my friends who are fluent in mandarin including my mother-in-law who's chinese
[2:30:59.180 --> 2:31:05.100]  As she said it's perfect translation where they're bragging about how they have people highly placed in our political system
[2:31:05.340 --> 2:31:11.340]  And now we know it just was in the media today being reported of uh of a chinese another chinese agent exposed
[2:31:12.060 --> 2:31:15.580]  But what they they they may have their instruments inside the dnc
[2:31:15.740 --> 2:31:20.220]  Even maybe inside the rnc and cnn and fox news the la times new york times
[2:31:20.220 --> 2:31:27.260]  But what they the anti fragile the anti fragility the strength of america our robustness is
[2:31:27.580 --> 2:31:30.940]  Are those info warriors? It's all those independent journalists
[2:31:31.340 --> 2:31:34.860]  It's those of us who refuse to to comply that we will resist
[2:31:35.340 --> 2:31:39.900]  That's something that they can't really wrap their mind around so we will win but we have to be vigilant
[2:31:40.220 --> 2:31:43.020]  That uh, we will not be defeated by the ccp
[2:31:43.100 --> 2:31:46.220]  We will defeat the ccp as as ambassador
[2:31:46.220 --> 2:31:50.540]  Sam brownback said when he went to china last year first thing he said when he got off the plane
[2:31:50.780 --> 2:31:52.780]  He said you're waging a war on religion
[2:31:53.500 --> 2:31:55.500]  You will lose religion will win
[2:31:55.900 --> 2:32:00.380]  And uh, that's what we're going to see. We will defeat the ccp, but we have to look the dragon in the face
[2:32:00.940 --> 2:32:09.740]  Uh congressman scott parry has a new bill that he just introduced to label the ccp as a transnational criminal organization
[2:32:10.060 --> 2:32:14.620]  In fact, it is a transnational criminal organization if you it should be labeled as such and there
[2:32:14.620 --> 2:32:19.820]  There should be severe penalties for anyone who who works with the ccp in any capacity
[2:32:20.140 --> 2:32:22.700]  Yeah, i'm meant to start the show with us today. There's so much big news
[2:32:23.180 --> 2:32:29.100]  These are huge sports stadiums full of people saying we'll defeat america. We own them last week. We played with their top
[2:32:29.580 --> 2:32:34.620]  Uh sociologists at another chinese commerce meeting that was on national tv over there
[2:32:34.700 --> 2:32:40.780]  But so controlled you don't see it here saying we will destroy america. It won't exist soon. We'll use the covet lockdown
[2:32:40.780 --> 2:32:45.820]  They'll never rebuild, but we're wide open. Ha ha ha. I mean, it's disgusting
[2:32:47.420 --> 2:32:53.100]  Yeah, they're raping africa. They're raping iraq. I have friends in iraq. We're building a school in iraq right now
[2:32:53.580 --> 2:32:59.100]  Uh that tell an iraqi friend says that they watch how the chinese treat their own labor as disposable
[2:32:59.660 --> 2:33:03.740]  And we don't want to defeat china. We want to liberate china from the ccp
[2:33:04.300 --> 2:33:09.020]  That's our goal ccp wants to destroy us. They want to do to us what they're doing to africans
[2:33:09.020 --> 2:33:14.940]  The exploitation the destruction what they were all connected and anyone telling you what you do to somebody else
[2:33:14.940 --> 2:33:19.980]  Doesn't come back when he was a liar whether we're chinese whether we're we're anglo whether we're africanism
[2:33:20.060 --> 2:33:22.060]  We're all humans. This is evil
[2:33:22.540 --> 2:33:25.500]  And now they're coming with their deadly vaccines that they admit are killing people
[2:33:25.660 --> 2:33:32.060]  I've got all the news pouring in where the uk announces get ready for mass death. I mean, this is biblical folks
[2:33:32.060 --> 2:33:34.940]  This is pure human sacrifice being normalized
[2:33:34.940 --> 2:33:39.900]  They hope to stop calm the center on the public when the deaths from the vaccines are so huge the right back stay with us
[2:33:43.420 --> 2:33:46.540]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year
[2:33:47.180 --> 2:33:49.740]  Just wait until you see the year 2021

[2:34:47.100 --> 2:34:51.500]  Then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major robber barons the planet by the 1920s
[2:34:51.980 --> 2:34:54.060]  He's all about corporate global governance
[2:34:54.060 --> 2:34:58.460]  And now you're seeing it hundreds of blue states the blue cities the communists and socialists
[2:34:58.700 --> 2:35:01.580]  Nations all working in unison under un control
[2:35:01.980 --> 2:35:06.780]  Establish a medical planetary dictatorship at the core of it is the fortune 100
[2:35:07.180 --> 2:35:13.580]  Corporations themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families the Rothschilds the Rockefellers
[2:35:13.820 --> 2:35:16.380]  The dutch and british royalty being at the very heart of that
[2:35:16.860 --> 2:35:20.540]  Then you learn the dutch and british royalty aren't even dutch or british at the same time
[2:35:20.540 --> 2:35:27.580]  But they go back to the literal count gracula and the wars in between christendom and islam
[2:35:28.460 --> 2:35:30.460]  Those that don't know history really are
[2:35:31.100 --> 2:35:36.460]  Doom repeated they're involved in plotting the world economy. That's what the social distancing the master all about
[2:35:37.100 --> 2:35:42.060]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply are complying with your own destruction wake up
[2:35:42.060 --> 2:35:49.980]  Imagine a dystopian novel or a dystopian science fiction movie where if you've had a cold
[2:35:50.300 --> 2:35:53.500]  It can be locked up in your home. You can be taken away. You can be forcibly
[2:35:53.980 --> 2:35:59.260]  Inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA
[2:35:59.740 --> 2:36:03.420]  Well, that's what we are in the year 2020 global government of the united nations
[2:36:03.740 --> 2:36:08.780]  All the authoritarian groups admit they're doing it. They even admit that they're doing it for power
[2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:13.100]  And control and that they're not even worried about coven 19
[2:36:13.260 --> 2:36:15.260]  That's what claus Schwab and others have said
[2:36:15.740 --> 2:36:20.700]  Think about how it's saying that as oh and big techs got a track you they've got a trachea. They've got to control you
[2:36:21.180 --> 2:36:25.900]  You've got to have absolutely your house wife. You've got to have secret police come disappear you because
[2:36:26.620 --> 2:36:32.620]  My god, this thing has one tenth of one percent chance of killing you give your ability to have cancer or a heart attack
[2:36:33.420 --> 2:36:35.100]  This is their takeover
[2:36:35.100 --> 2:36:41.900]  Imagine on america's dystopia killed by the fear of the common goals. Yeah, that's fair wandering. That's my control
[2:36:44.540 --> 2:36:50.780]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands
[2:36:51.500 --> 2:36:55.180]  But if you were a person just 200 years ago, you saw that you think it was magic
[2:36:55.820 --> 2:36:58.700]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them
[2:36:59.500 --> 2:37:03.180]  So for that person it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit
[2:37:03.180 --> 2:37:08.300]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies of any other species of animal
[2:37:08.380 --> 2:37:13.820]  They'll have to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born. They're following magnetic lines
[2:37:14.220 --> 2:37:19.340]  They have magnetic cells in their brains. We don't know side of what's going on. There's even a lot more than that
[2:37:19.900 --> 2:37:21.900]  So we talk about the spirit
[2:37:22.060 --> 2:37:24.700]  We're talking about all the dark matter. We're talking about all the things you don't understand
[2:37:24.700 --> 2:37:29.420]  But we know it's there and just like you can have a bunch of robots working on the wireless system
[2:37:29.420 --> 2:37:32.860]  That's what's going on with this satanic transmission
[2:37:33.420 --> 2:37:39.020]  It's working through people and that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a
[2:37:39.580 --> 2:37:42.060]  consciousness manipulative of space-time continuum
[2:37:42.060 --> 2:37:55.100]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:38:13.020 --> 2:38:20.700]  We are back live jason jones filmmaker author patriot really citizen activist so much human rights around the country and around the world
[2:38:21.260 --> 2:38:25.500]  And man, I'm seriously trying to get out even earlier on thursday so I can be at this or maybe wednesday night
[2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:27.340]  That's tomorrow night gosh
[2:38:27.340 --> 2:38:29.340]  Stop the ccp slave camps
[2:38:29.900 --> 2:38:36.700]  That is 11 a.m. To 1 p.m. US capital washington dc constitution avenue first street the chai comms hate this
[2:38:37.260 --> 2:38:39.500]  They hate to betton activists. They hate
[2:38:39.500 --> 2:38:43.100]  I.E.T.A.R.E.T.A.I.I.T.A.F.A.HONG KONG.
[2:38:43.580 --> 2:38:49.340]  As you have that footage we were showing for tv viewers earlier of the busts with the political activists being taken away to re education camps
[2:38:49.740 --> 2:38:51.820]  Out of Hong Kong or families begging and screaming
[2:38:52.380 --> 2:38:54.380]  That's not coming. That's here
[2:38:55.100 --> 2:38:58.540]  And so jason jones what would you call this period in history?
[2:38:59.020 --> 2:39:00.940]  We're in right now the quickening because I mean
[2:39:01.740 --> 2:39:05.100]  I used to say once a year that's my biggest show ever
[2:39:05.660 --> 2:39:07.660]  Now it's like every day. It just gets crazier of the news
[2:39:07.660 --> 2:39:12.860]  My most important speech ever the next day said this is even more important. I mean it seems to be a quickening. What would you call this?
[2:39:13.740 --> 2:39:19.900]  You know, I say it's a new axial age because I'm hopeful. I think that we're victorious
[2:39:19.900 --> 2:39:24.280]  We're in a scramble right now. We're in the fight for our lives. We're in the fight for our posterity's lives
[2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:30.940]  We're really in a struggle to save three million people from decimation in Chinese occupied East Turkestan
[2:39:30.940 --> 2:39:36.580]  But I am hopeful I believe that we're going to win and that on the other side of this can be a culture of life
[2:39:36.580 --> 2:39:42.340]  Love and beauty not through some dystopian ideology, but just do the simple
[2:39:42.460 --> 2:39:50.340]  Respect for the incomparable dignity of the human person for basic human respect not grandiose ideas not big plans
[2:39:50.340 --> 2:39:54.260]  Not ideologies not neoliberal technocratic fantasies
[2:39:54.820 --> 2:39:56.340]  but a
[2:39:56.340 --> 2:40:02.580]  renewed respect for the human person and so I and and and why I call it an axial age
[2:40:02.580 --> 2:40:08.140]  You know, there was that one era we're in a century. We had Socrates and Plato and Aristotle and Confucius and Buddha
[2:40:08.900 --> 2:40:14.820]  There's there's just we're definitely there's a huge awakening happening. That's why tyranny trying to suppress it
[2:40:15.940 --> 2:40:18.400]  Yeah, it's it's maybe by the grace of God
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:23.980]  I pray the last gap that the great lies the big lies where I I
[2:40:24.540 --> 2:40:29.640]  Think out you probably lying bed say I wish I was the coupe. They said I was I wish that I was wrong
[2:40:29.640 --> 2:40:37.020]  I was like absolutely looted and I can't tell you how many people I hear say that Alex Jones was trying to tell us all
[2:40:37.020 --> 2:40:44.380]  The time he's been trying to tell us for decades and now it's here and look when you stare a dragon in the face
[2:40:44.380 --> 2:40:46.780]  It's not that scary, but you have to look it in the face
[2:40:46.780 --> 2:40:53.100]  We have to look it in the eyes the CCP the neoliberal elite. It's one dragon apple
[2:40:53.100 --> 2:40:58.460]  Uh, uh, well, uh, Google, um, Nike
[2:40:59.020 --> 2:41:06.240]  This is the same dragon. I mean, it is really tragic that we know that we are actually you and I have profited
[2:41:06.580 --> 2:41:10.920]  From this slavery not not unknowingly unwillingly
[2:41:11.340 --> 2:41:16.900]  But they lure us in and meanwhile, we're decimating Americans and decimating whole communities
[2:41:16.900 --> 2:41:22.580]  Uh, that have just been wiped off the plot wiped off the money like something. I want to say to conservatives and Christians
[2:41:22.700 --> 2:41:24.780]  Because I see it in the comments at Bandai video
[2:41:24.780 --> 2:41:28.500]  It's minority people are like the one good thing China is doing to get rid of the Muslims
[2:41:28.780 --> 2:41:32.580]  Just because Islam has radical groups throughout our control that attack us and kill us
[2:41:32.620 --> 2:41:35.660]  We don't become like them and the Uighurs weren't doing that
[2:41:35.660 --> 2:41:41.460]  They're doing to Christians and Buddhists as well by the hundreds of thousands and the millions and it's wrong for everybody
[2:41:41.460 --> 2:41:47.060]  And those are children and so we aren't who our enemy is we stand up and set the damn standard
[2:41:47.060 --> 2:41:49.060]  That's what America is supposed to do
[2:41:49.140 --> 2:41:54.140]  Pisses me off that people sit there. I oppose radicalism. I oppose them what they're doing
[2:41:54.140 --> 2:41:57.420]  I will fight them, but does it mean that I support the commonest Chinese?
[2:41:57.860 --> 2:42:04.340]  That that that our light years more evil than even some of the worst Islamists feeding on those damn people that aren't even
[2:42:04.580 --> 2:42:06.680]  Expansive we're coming after anybody. It's wrong
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:13.120]  You know what I would say to them Alex is do you and I want to be judged by John Brennan's drone war the decimated thousands of children's
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:19.360]  In Yemen and Pakistan. We don't want to go on the last week said yeah, I killed a bunch of innocent people. I'm proud of it
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:26.840]  Heartbreak and you know when I traveled to Middle East in Iraq and Syria and Sudan and I talked to Muslims
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:34.040]  Oh, I'm always amazed at how they differentiate between us and our government and and we need to be disciplined
[2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:39.080]  And and we need to be disciplined and do the same thing, you know as a Christian
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:42.620]  And I'm not a great Christian Alex you know you pull that guy's mask off
[2:42:42.620 --> 2:42:45.460]  You saw me getting a heated dispute on camera as well
[2:42:45.460 --> 2:42:50.360]  I say I know you're made in the image of God till you cut me off in traffic and then you know I forget but
[2:42:50.600 --> 2:42:56.920]  But we have to just be really disciplined our country was founded on the truth of the human person
[2:42:56.920 --> 2:42:58.920]  We're the only country in the history of the world
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:06.400]  Founded on anthropology that recognizes that we have an alienable right because we are creatures made in the image
[2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:10.040]  The likeness of God we can get an ear on must rock it find any direction
[2:43:10.880 --> 2:43:14.000]  For all eternity and never see anything as beautiful as our neighbor
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:19.320]  That's the truth of the human person these Uighurs are human beings with an incomparable
[2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:22.320]  That's for sure what we love happen will happen to us
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:29.600]  It's it this is a test what we do for them and the unborn and others is an absolute is what's gonna come back on us
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:34.320]  That's true. I mean that is the sorrowful truth because
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:40.640]  What Bishop Bolton sheen said after Roe versus Wade he was an Emmy award-winning
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:43.560]  He had a television show in the 50s that what he won Emmys
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:47.880]  He said that what Roe v Wade will do what Roe v Wade did is
[2:43:47.880 --> 2:43:52.120]  Is it taught us there was no limits to our desires and our wants and that?
[2:43:52.920 --> 2:43:54.920]  Anything and everything would be possible
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:43:59.120]  And and now we're suffering the consequences with euthanasia
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:01.600]  assisted to this Xavier character
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:03.720]  that
[2:44:03.720 --> 2:44:05.640]  that
[2:44:05.640 --> 2:44:14.080]  Biden is now tapped is an adamant supporter of euthanasia killing babies after they're born and that's the thing folks if we don't value
[2:44:14.080 --> 2:44:18.080]  Other people no one's gonna value us
[2:44:18.880 --> 2:44:23.520]  You know, and that's why I love the pro-life movement Alex Jones because you know when you stand with the
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:28.000]  Vulnerable that no one else will stand with you're reminding them the truth about who they are
[2:44:28.360 --> 2:44:33.400]  When you wrestle with that with whether it's a tough issue and I acknowledge abortion is a very tough issue
[2:44:33.760 --> 2:44:38.600]  When you wrestle with an issue like that you come to understand the incomparable beauty of the human person you change
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:42.480]  How you see yourself not just how you see the dignity of the child of the womb
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:47.480]  It changes how you see the Uighur how you see that I value my children. I value myself
[2:44:47.480 --> 2:44:53.440]  I value them we're all connected and the minute we start not valuing people. We've devalued ourselves
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:44:57.960]  Yeah, when I hear of a US drone strike
[2:44:58.240 --> 2:45:02.400]  It Obama ordered to kill 36 women in one village true story
[2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:07.080]  I think of all the women in my wife's community and our homeschool co-op
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:10.240]  I think of all of them. I when I hear of children dying in a drone strike
[2:45:10.240 --> 2:45:12.480]  I think of my love for my child and
[2:45:12.920 --> 2:45:18.120]  Of course, they love their children the same as we love our children. They their hearts break
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:24.800]  They're addled with sorrow and despair the same way that the victims of 9-11 or addled with sorrow and despair every day of their life
[2:45:25.360 --> 2:45:29.600]  I work with Christians fighting Muslim oppression in Nigeria
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:32.760]  I work with the Muslims standing up to the CCP in
[2:45:33.360 --> 2:45:37.880]  Chinese-occupied East Turkestan. I work with the Uighur. I'm sorry with the Yazidis who
[2:45:37.880 --> 2:45:39.880]  I feel oppression and discrimination
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:42.600]  Coming on them from every level in the United States
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:48.160]  We have to fight with their own family to acknowledge the dignity of our own children in the wombs of their mothers
[2:45:49.280 --> 2:45:52.720]  But that's what I think the gospel is the gospel of human life
[2:45:52.720 --> 2:45:58.640]  Well, that's really what America's credo is especially the armies is battling you in the army is battling for the oppressed
[2:45:58.640 --> 2:46:04.440]  And the minute we don't do that we lose all value we fall apart and then there's nothing left civilization
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:09.160]  There's a social contract on valuing each other and being strong and it produces prosperity
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:15.360]  Every time we have prosperity people get spoiled. They become decadent. We forget what made us great an amazing event coming up
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:21.440]  What's the best website for folks to visit Jason Jones to help coordinate even if they can't go to DC for this this Thursday morning
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:23.600]  How do folks promote this?
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  If you go to
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:32.240]  There's the event it's gonna be a constitution to happen on 1st Street if you go to the Jason Jones show our podcast
[2:46:32.240 --> 2:46:36.920]  I just interviewed the Prime Minister of Occupied East Turkestan and in the show notes
[2:46:36.920 --> 2:46:42.920]  We have all the information there. You can share that that's a beautiful meme that our friend Ali Alexander created this graphic and
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:46.680]  You know Alex when you wore the Dopa the hat of the
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:49.280]  Weaver when you wore that
[2:46:49.280 --> 2:46:50.760]  my friends
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:56.520]  From in Turkey that worked directly with those in China in occupied East Turkestan
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:46:59.320]  They said that image of Alex Jones with that Dopa
[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:02.640]  It reached into the camps and you cannot imagine
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:10.560]  What it means to people who are on the edge of despair to know that a man that can reach millions of folks that you broke the
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:14.200]  Internet last week that you've taken their cause on as your cause
[2:47:14.680 --> 2:47:22.200]  You are breathing hope into people that really live on the edge of despair and all those info warriors that are taking this cause as their cause
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:28.040]  You're rocking the world. You're changing the world and it's someone I've worked with the Uighur for years and years now
[2:47:28.040 --> 2:47:34.040]  It means the world to me just from this show out your show is probably double the amount of people who are aware of the plight of the
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:35.880]  Weaver. It's so horrible
[2:47:35.880 --> 2:47:39.640]  They're harvesting organs. No one believes that they're well excited about credit
[2:47:39.640 --> 2:47:45.920]  How scary is it that info wars is one of the only places in your work? This should be everywhere it out evil apple is
[2:47:45.920 --> 2:47:49.560]  That's why I almost punched that guy quite frankly, but he was just making fun of us
[2:47:49.560 --> 2:47:51.720]  I was like you care about he's like yeah, he was like laughing about it
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:53.920]  That's why I got out of the armored vehicle to go over there
[2:47:53.920 --> 2:47:59.120]  But listen Jason regardless. I'll see you in DC. We love you. We appreciate you Paul Watson's about to take over
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:01.120]  But it brings tears to my eyes
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:05.800]  Just think about my stupid face with a hat on making folks feel good
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:10.120]  but that shows you how desperate they are with no solidarity and no support in living hell and
[2:48:10.960 --> 2:48:15.080]  Just that we're aligned with the most evil country the world's ever seen makes me physically sick
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:17.960]  All right, look, I know I got loaded phone lines. I've tried to get them all
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:22.000]  I'll try to get to a couple of them here than Paul Watson takes over at about six seven minutes

[2:49:45.680 --> 2:49:47.280]  Why do they love death?
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:49.280]  because they hate themselves

[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:52.800]  China signed an agreement the early 1970s to sterilize over 100 million other people and they did it in spades and now
[2:50:53.040 --> 2:50:55.880]  It is time for Europe the United States to be sterilized
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:51:03.720]  And now the mRNA vaccine is coming to seal the agreement for global depopulation crank this song up
[2:51:17.240 --> 2:51:24.360]  Maria you're on the air from the great state of Texas. Thanks for holding you say you are a nurse want to talk about vaccine safety
[2:51:24.360 --> 2:51:26.360]  COVID martial law. Thank you
[2:51:26.880 --> 2:51:32.280]  Yes, thank you for all that you do Alex and we love your products. Thank you
[2:51:32.280 --> 2:51:39.920]  Um, I I'm a nurse. I'm also a veteran my husband's active duty and so we live here in Central Texas and
[2:51:40.880 --> 2:51:42.880]  I am
[2:51:42.920 --> 2:51:45.520]  I'm so freaking pissed off
[2:51:46.280 --> 2:51:50.840]  With what's happening as far as rolling out these vaccines
[2:51:50.840 --> 2:51:57.400]  I'm not right now. I know the military is supposed to not have to take it. It's supposed to be optional
[2:51:57.680 --> 2:51:59.680]  But I'm telling you I
[2:52:00.040 --> 2:52:04.600]  After serving in the military and get all the vaccines that I got I developed epilepsy
[2:52:04.600 --> 2:52:08.960]  I developed a neuromuscular disorder and this is no joke
[2:52:09.760 --> 2:52:14.280]  Ma'am you just heard the head of the US bio weapons law just settled. It's true
[2:52:14.280 --> 2:52:18.640]  I mean this is a sick eugenics cult and again our military are great
[2:52:18.640 --> 2:52:23.440]  It's a tiny criminal medical core that is carrying this out against you
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:29.360]  My husband's a doctor and so that's why he knows that right now. They're optional and believe me
[2:52:29.360 --> 2:52:34.200]  He does not believe in any of this COVID crap and he does not want the vaccine and
[2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:37.600]  I just we're worried that he may have to get it
[2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:40.480]  He had to get anthrax before the anthrax
[2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:43.960]  What you have for those that don't know there is no vaccine for anthrax. They just did it
[2:52:43.960 --> 2:52:48.840]  Totally. Yeah, I don't I don't know what they gave him. This was he's close to retirement
[2:52:48.840 --> 2:52:51.840]  This was a long time ago. I think it was the
[2:52:52.560 --> 2:52:54.560]  90 and yeah
[2:52:55.360 --> 2:52:57.360]  Yeah
[2:52:57.920 --> 2:53:03.480]  Here's the deal anthrax can live 10,000 years in the dirt you can radiate it you can cut it up
[2:53:03.560 --> 2:53:09.760]  It keeps coming back. So how do you give someone an immunity to spores that are basically a plant?
[2:53:09.760 --> 2:53:14.440]  He does it. It's the same thing with a common cold and the reason I know that is I've interviewed
[2:53:15.240 --> 2:53:21.760]  Tons of medical doctors the medical doctors that blew the whistle in Denver the first time and when other guys were dying
[2:53:21.760 --> 2:53:23.760]  I interviewed those guys. So that's why I know about it
[2:53:24.280 --> 2:53:28.960]  It's just so freaking disgusting as a healthcare provider as to the two people
[2:53:29.400 --> 2:53:35.360]  That believe in helping people that laugh that phone call with the woman that was upset that pissed me off
[2:53:35.360 --> 2:53:42.240]  What about the mental health of people? You know, this is just looking at your amazing and and you know, they did this to you
[2:53:42.240 --> 2:53:43.880]  Here's the deal
[2:53:43.880 --> 2:53:50.000]  They want to spike the cannons after the war. So they they know veterans are hard-working good people that join for the right reason
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:55.880]  They want to debilitate you to ruin the rest of your life if they've used you their scum. So I say
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:54:01.080]  Bill Gates needs to be taken all the vaccines. He's given he needs the epilepsy
[2:54:01.080 --> 2:54:08.040]  He needs the narcolepsy and everything you thought is on record happening. So the good news is did you see the UN's own top vaccine?
[2:54:08.040 --> 2:54:12.240]  People in December saying vaccines and stop. That's why they're doing this is they're scared
[2:54:13.280 --> 2:54:19.400]  Yeah, and I'm just I don't know why Trump is moving this operation warp speed forward because I love Trump
[2:54:19.400 --> 2:54:22.320]  But if he's gonna push something that's not great
[2:54:22.320 --> 2:54:24.800]  It's it's it's the final thing for Trump because there's the deal
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:28.240]  Trump gets back in we'll all take the shot least I won't but others will
[2:54:28.240 --> 2:54:34.200]  Biden gets in no one will take the shot. So in a way, you know, Trump again, once they get the economy going
[2:54:34.200 --> 2:54:38.320]  He doesn't know this is not a regular vaccine. He's not a scientist. I've talked to lots of Trump
[2:54:38.320 --> 2:54:43.320]  He's very smart about a lot of things when it comes to science. He's like, oh, it's science. It must be great
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:47.800]  No, dude, it doesn't just mean because it's science. It's great. We love you, Maria
[2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:53.520]  All right, Chris David Bob David Scott and Scott. We're getting your names. We're getting your numbers, and I promise

[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:54.920]  Transmitting worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom. You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:03.640]  Welcome back everybody and we are live is the summit news hour with me Paul Joseph Watson
[2:57:03.640 --> 2:57:09.920]  And of course today we had the first person injected with the new amazing astounding
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:15.760]  Coronavirus vaccine in the entire world and it happened in the United Kingdom
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:23.920]  And of course the nurse injecting the elderly person there in the hospital was of Filipino origin
[2:57:23.920 --> 2:57:32.920]  We've also learned today that a Turkish couple who lived in Germany a Turkish migrant couple had a role in developing the vaccine
[2:57:32.920 --> 2:57:41.920]  So obviously the sensible argument is that now we should just throw open the borders eliminate all border controls
[2:57:41.920 --> 2:57:47.920]  Let the entirety of Africa and the Middle East into the west and that makes perfect sense
[2:57:47.920 --> 2:58:00.920]  That's literally the argument they're now making because skilled labor migrants and nurses had a role in inoculating the first people in the United Kingdom with this COVID vaccine
[2:58:00.920 --> 2:58:05.920]  That means that mass untrammeled immigration must be a fantastic thing, right?
[2:58:05.920 --> 2:58:09.920]  Makes perfect sense doesn't it? We're going to get into that
[2:58:09.920 --> 2:58:16.920]  We're also going to get into the fact that the stench of COVID hypocrisy is hanging heavy in the air once again
[2:58:16.920 --> 2:58:21.920]  Of course we had Gavin and Newsom having a fancy French dinner
[2:58:21.920 --> 2:58:26.920]  Literally hours after he told everybody else to stay at home we had Nancy Pelosi
[2:58:26.920 --> 2:58:33.920]  Getting her hair dyed in a barbers not wearing a mask while she was telling everyone else to wear a mask
[2:58:33.920 --> 2:58:39.920]  We had Diane Feinstein not wearing a mask in Congress when she was telling everyone else to wear a mask
[2:58:39.920 --> 2:58:46.920]  We had reporters from ABC News and others lecturing people about not wearing masks in the Rose Garden
[2:58:46.920 --> 2:58:53.920]  Having been pictured out on Cinco de Mayo in the case of one of them not wearing masks when everyone else was wearing a mask
[2:58:53.920 --> 2:58:58.920]  Well now we have another case of that, headline out of RT
[2:58:58.920 --> 2:59:06.920]  Hypocrite Sky News broadcasters dragged over the coals for flouting COVID-19 rules after spending months scolding others
[2:59:06.920 --> 2:59:15.920]  Now bear in mind Sky News is without a doubt the most hysterical broadcaster in the United Kingdom when it comes to COVID-19
[2:59:15.920 --> 2:59:26.920]  Now you would expect the BBC to be the most hysterical but we know the BBC is a gender and they at least have to abide by their impartiality rules to some extent
[2:59:26.920 --> 2:59:35.920]  Sky News doesn't really have to do that, they started as a news organization as kind of the right wing hedge against the BBC
[2:59:35.920 --> 2:59:47.920]  Now they're farther left than the BBC has ever been basically and two, three in fact of their presenters have been caught violating these stupid COVID rules
[2:59:47.920 --> 3:00:01.920]  Having lectured the rest of the population for the past seven months about how their immoral bad people and how they're killing granny if they don't abide by every ridiculous coronavirus measure
[3:00:01.920 --> 3:00:15.920]  The article says Sky News presenter Kay Burley, by the way this is somebody who relentlessly takes the establishment side on every single issue imaginable, particularly Brexit over the past couple of years
[3:00:15.920 --> 3:00:28.920]  So she and a host of her colleagues have been branded hypocrites for flouting COVID-19 restrictions for the Ankerwoman's 60th birthday party after spending months chastising others about breaking the rules
[3:00:28.920 --> 3:00:39.920]  So basically she had 10 of her colleagues, including Beth Rigby, Inzamam Rashid and Sam Washington including those prominent Sky News presenters
[3:00:39.920 --> 3:00:53.920]  Have a birthday bash at the Century Club in Soho London on Saturday night in violation of the COVID rules because in the United Kingdom under these tier two restrictions which is basically lockdown
[3:00:53.920 --> 3:01:08.920]  De facto lockdown, you can only go out if you live with the same person in the same household inside, if it's outside you can meet up to six people but again you have to maintain social distancing and all this crap
[3:01:08.920 --> 3:01:26.920]  She decided to override that completely and hang out with 10 people in a club in London on Saturday night as while the glamorous gathering appeared to break the UK's rule of six, the group tried to get around the coronavirus restrictions by spanning across two separate tables at the Swanky restaurant
[3:01:26.920 --> 3:01:43.920]  The problem is they later moved on to Burley's home to continue the celebrations, so the very thing that they've been lecturing others about, you know, people out gathering on the streets after this 10pm curfew, people going back to each other's homes for house parties
[3:01:43.920 --> 3:01:57.920]  They all did the exact same thing and I don't really care about that because that's what I've been doing for the past six months anyway because I think people should defy these ridiculous clampdowns on their basic liberties and freedoms
[3:01:57.920 --> 3:02:15.920]  These people have been on national television saying you shouldn't do that, not only telling you not to but saying you're directly responsible for killing people if you do that and lo and behold what do they do with the first available opportunity and bearing in mind this is the one time when they were caught
[3:02:15.920 --> 3:02:31.920]  These same people have been probably doing this for the past six to eight months like everyone else. Meanwhile, as you see in the video here, people literally visiting their elderly parents in nursing homes through a glass-perspect window
[3:02:31.920 --> 3:02:51.920]  Trying to point out in this case, a 73-year-old who visited, I think it was something like a 93-year-old mother, that she looks very ill, she's having difficulty breathing. The woman tried to get in there and take her mother, she tried to literally take her mother out of the care home because she thought she was being mistreated
[3:02:51.920 --> 3:03:13.920]  She was subsequently arrested, she went back and these people just shouted at her and wheeled her mother away. Meanwhile, the people who lecture you about not being able to attend weddings, funerals or visit your own parents or hug your own parents at Christmas are out living it up on the tiles on a Saturday night and then going back home for a massive house party
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:29.920]  Burley was absent from her breakfast show Tuesday morning after the Guido Fox website published news of the rule breaching bash on Monday evening. Sky said it was disappointed by the incident and that all of the staff are facing a review of their conduct
[3:03:29.920 --> 3:03:49.920]  And there was a tweet from somebody pointing out the hypocrisy here Laura Perrin said, quote, Sky news has been one of the main pushes of COVID hysteria. Normally I wouldn't give a toss about what Kay Burley did on her birthday, but if she broke the rule of six, she is a raging hypocrite, but then we always knew the rules don't apply to the elite
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:04:08.920]  And it wasn't just her. Here's another headline out of Guido Fox blog. Sky presenters coming style 206 miles trip for Burley's birthday party, bearing in mind we had literally a news cycle which lasted for almost a month, where they were up in arms about this
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:22.920]  Government advisor Dominic Cummings, who I'm no fan of, because he was literally one of the main people in the Conservative Party, pushing for these lockdown measures, traveling hundreds of miles to visit his family for a family emergency.
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:39.920]  He was raked over the coals for weeks on end by people like Kay Burley, by people like this individual, but then they all go back for their own massive house party says a sky news internal investigation causes angst inside the Osterley campus.
[3:04:39.920 --> 3:04:54.920]  A sky mole gets in contact with Guido to add fuel to the fire, pointing out that not only did Kay's birthday bash break tier two laws, the broadcasters north of England correspondent Insamam Rashid had to travel down from his Manchester home to attend.
[3:04:54.920 --> 3:05:16.920]  That is a 206 mile journey and in the rules it states it has to be an essential trip. 60th birthday party, not really an essential trip, especially as you're traveling 206 miles says Guido's mole suggests management wants to get rid of Insamam as they feel his presence and breach was particularly egregious.
[3:05:16.920 --> 3:05:32.920]  And the update on this is that sky news host Kay Burley taken off air until next year after she admitted breaching coronavirus restrictions the presenter has been removed from the channel after breaching coronavirus guidelines in London.
[3:05:32.920 --> 3:05:52.920]  So she's gone for a few weeks everyone forgotten about it by then then she'll be back on the television lecturing you about what your behavior should be. Meanwhile, the same people, grandstanding trying to have the moral righteous high ground on COVID telling you that you're killing granny if you want to go out and see your friends or family.
[3:05:52.920 --> 3:06:11.920]  What do they do when somebody they don't like catches coronavirus. They celebrate it with glee because they're the good people. They really care about people dying from COVID, apart from if somebody they don't like politically gets it, in which case, it's fantastic.
[3:06:11.920 --> 3:06:25.920]  Headline sick lefty celebs celebrate Giuliani getting COVID. Just as they did when President Trump was diagnosed with the coronavirus two months ago, leftist celebrities are celebrating the announcement that Rudy Giuliani has the virus.
[3:06:25.920 --> 3:06:36.920]  So they're the good people. They have the moral high ground. They get to tell you what to do. They get to break all the same rules. And then if anyone they don't like gets COVID, suddenly it becomes a good thing.
[3:06:36.920 --> 3:06:40.920]  Don't go away. We'll be right back summit dot news. Stay right there.
[3:06:40.920 --> 3:06:49.920]  You know, something very sad is happening. It's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago and info wars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[3:06:49.920 --> 3:07:03.920]  I want everybody that was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives,
[3:07:03.920 --> 3:07:14.920]  nationals and populace. And now that's happened. And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate and protest using a second COVID 19 lockdown.
[3:07:14.920 --> 3:07:26.920]  And that Trump need to get out front and fully repudiate COVID 19 is basically an overblown hoax. He started to do that the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[3:07:26.920 --> 3:07:35.920]  They're going to use black lives matter and race for to start up the American people and divide us. And they're going to use economic warfare, shredding down the economy to try to control us.
[3:07:35.920 --> 3:08:00.920]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air. Tell me what's coming next.
[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:07.920]  Now, this is undoubtedly the biggest sales of the year. It's been a year full of sales because the country's in an emergency. The economy's breaking down.
[3:08:07.920 --> 3:08:14.920]  But I want you to get your ultimate control, your ultimate turmeric bodies formula, your DNA, plus your x2, your x3, your ultra 12.

[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:09.920]  So the same people who have been drilling the fear of God into especially elderly people of this coronavirus again, once again,
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:13.920]  caught violating the rules that they demand everyone else follow.
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:24.920]  Sky News broadcasters Kay Burley and others going to their non socially distanced dinner party, then going back home for another house party and complete violation of the rules,
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:31.920]  which again, they ran down everyone else's throat and expect everyone else to follow. And in fact, we got a clip of this.
[3:09:31.920 --> 3:09:46.920]  This is Kay Burley and Beth Rigby, a short compilation of them lecturing other people on what the rules should be and however everyone else should follow them while being caught completely flouting them themselves.
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:49.920]  Here is the clip.
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:51.920]  Why should we abide by the rules?
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:56.920]  Ordinary families have put up with all kinds of restrictions and hardships.
[3:09:56.920 --> 3:10:03.920]  People not even going into hospital when their kids have been having cancer treatment. Why are you so different?
[3:10:03.920 --> 3:10:05.920]  We don't need to go into all of that detail.
[3:10:05.920 --> 3:10:09.920]  How can you even countenance at the moment staying on and not resigning?
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:17.920]  Everybody at home is screaming at the telly saying it's one rule for us and it's one rule for them and you're falling into that trap.
[3:10:17.920 --> 3:10:20.920]  How could you not even check with your boss?
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:25.920]  If we break the law, does that make your position on ten ago?
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:29.920]  One rule for them, another rule for us and we know what bracket they're in.
[3:10:29.920 --> 3:10:38.920]  The rule breakers who lecture you endlessly, righteously about what you should do with your lives while completely ignoring their own advice.
[3:10:38.920 --> 3:10:49.920]  Do as they say, not as they do and on the subject of certain people within a certain privileged tier being able to avoid these rules that everyone else is subject to.
[3:10:49.920 --> 3:10:58.920]  We had this headline on Summit.News from a few days ago, rich people and journalists made exempt from having to enter COVID quarantine.
[3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:07.920]  So for the past three or four months anyone travelling to basically every major western country in the world, flying out of the UK,
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:12.920]  when they come back to the UK they have to self-isolate for 14 days.
[3:11:12.920 --> 3:11:20.920]  If they get caught not self-isolating by the NHS they get a fine and those fines compound over time.
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:29.920]  Those rules now don't apply to two privileged classes of people, namely journalists and rich people.
[3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:46.920]  The headline, rich people and journalists made exempt from having to enter COVID quarantine. Anyone defined as a high value business traveller will be made exempt from having to enter a two week COVID quarantine when they return to the UK under new rules announced by the government.
[3:11:46.920 --> 3:11:55.920]  This came in on Saturday at 4am so they had a certain category of people who don't have to abide by the rules.
[3:11:55.920 --> 3:12:01.920]  They include wealthy sports stars, journalists and high value business travellers.
[3:12:01.920 --> 3:12:08.920]  So basically if you're a journalist or if you're rich you don't have to abide by the same rules that everyone else has to abide by.
[3:12:08.920 --> 3:12:21.920]  Interesting given that of course we know the COVID lockdown has completely crushed small businesses across the west while giant transnational corporations like Amazon and Wal-Mart make record profits.
[3:12:21.920 --> 3:12:29.920]  The people who work for those kind of corporations are completely immune from the rules that the rest of us have to follow.
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:41.920]  Now in regard to this vaccine, the big question on many people's lips is how many people in each particular country will submit to this vaccine, will agree to take it.
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:53.920]  The polls have been varied across all these different countries as a headline here out of Euro news says will any countries in Europe make the COVID vaccine compulsory.
[3:12:53.920 --> 3:13:02.920]  Says only around a third of French people have said they would take a coronavirus vaccine according to a survey conducted in October.
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:10.920]  63% of Brits said they would take it followed by 57% of Germans and 55% of Italians.
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:17.920]  Meanwhile more than 40% of Spaniards would prefer not to be vaccinated at all with approved drugs.
[3:13:17.920 --> 3:13:27.920]  So you've got in many countries and in France even over half or almost half in other countries of people saying they will not take this vaccine.
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:38.920]  Now of course within those polls you have to factor in the fact that as we saw during the presidential election, many people who take part in these surveys tell the pollsters what they want to hear.
[3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:42.920]  They tell them what things make them a good person.
[3:13:42.920 --> 3:13:54.920]  So those numbers for people who say they're going to take the coronavirus vaccine are probably substantially lower than they're actually saying when they answer the question in the poll.
[3:13:54.920 --> 3:14:04.920]  So you've got this difficulty that governments now have of rolling out this vaccine and trying to convince us all that it's absolutely crucial that everybody gets it.
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:14.920]  That we get a vaccine to solve a virus which we have a 99.5% survival rate in terms of younger people below the age of 40.
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:20.920]  They have a big difficulty in convincing people to get this vaccine and they're just not going to do it.
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:26.920]  So in these numbers you will find collapse to an even greater degree.
[3:14:26.920 --> 3:14:34.920]  I would say they're going to struggle getting over 50% of people in all these major countries to take this vaccine which is interesting.
[3:14:34.920 --> 3:14:44.920]  When you look at this headline out of Breitbart, Fauci, if only 50% get vaccinated we lack umbrella of immunity over us.
[3:14:44.920 --> 3:14:53.920]  Anthony Fauci stressed that well over a majority of Americans will need to get vaccinated in order to create a proper umbrella of immunity over us.
[3:14:53.920 --> 3:15:01.920]  He said I'm frustrated that we see polls that suggest a high percent of Americans are not ready to take this vaccine, 49% nationwide.
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:09.920]  So almost half and I would suggest that that's more than half given this bias that people have with telling pollsters what they want to hear.
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:21.920]  Over half of Americans will not take this vaccine. He points out that this is a bigger problem in the black community where 57% say they're not ready to take the vaccine.
[3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:28.920]  Fauci says 75% to 80% need to be vaccinated to hit critical mass on the vaccination.
[3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:32.920]  That's a problem if you have 50% saying I'm not taking it.
[3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:44.920]  So Fauci is literally saying if 75% to 80% of Americans do not take this vaccine it's going to be pretty much pointless and the coronavirus is going to be here to stay.
[3:15:44.920 --> 3:15:56.920]  And basically that's what they want. I'm going to make a prediction way less people than these health authorities are expecting or saying publicly at least will take the vaccine.
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:02.920]  Then we'll have a third wave of coronavirus. You've seen all this propaganda over a second wave in Europe.
[3:16:02.920 --> 3:16:07.920]  Most of it was down to rapid over testing and false positive testing.
[3:16:07.920 --> 3:16:15.920]  What's going to happen is they're going to have a third wave of coronavirus and they're going to blame it on the people who didn't take the vaccine.
[3:16:15.920 --> 3:16:27.920]  Yes, it's going to be your fault once again. Just as the second wave was the fault of people not following the rules people out in the streets engaged in anti lockdown protests.
[3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:29.920]  It was their fault that we had the second wave.
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:44.920]  Of course, the far bigger Black Lives Matter protests apparently they were just magically immune from the coronavirus and they literally trotted out scientists to claim that those super spreader events had no impact on it whatsoever.
[3:16:44.920 --> 3:16:48.920]  But it's your fault for participating in the anti lockdown protest.
[3:16:48.920 --> 3:16:54.920]  It's your fault for not wearing the mask and it's going to be your fault for not taking the vaccine.
[3:16:54.920 --> 3:17:04.920]  And at that point, then they're going to start to move to make it mandatory not from a government level, but from the level of saying, you know, you can't get into a sports venue.
[3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:09.920]  You can't travel on an airline. You can't get into a restaurant if you haven't taken the shot.
[3:17:09.920 --> 3:17:15.920]  And the only way they're going to do that is by blaming people who don't take the shot for the third wave.
[3:17:15.920 --> 3:17:21.920]  So they're going to be less, way less people taking it than they expect, or at least they publicly pronounce.
[3:17:21.920 --> 3:17:30.920]  And then those people are going to be castigated, demonized to an even greater degree than they're already being in the mainstream media.
[3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:34.920]  And that's going to mandate this compulsory vaccination ethos.
[3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:37.920]  Don't go away. We'll be right back summit.news.
[3:17:37.920 --> 3:17:41.920]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes,
[3:17:41.920 --> 3:17:49.920]  then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major Robert Barons, the planet by the 1920s, is all about corporate global governance.
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:56.920]  And now you're seeing hundreds of blue states, blue cities, the communists and socialists, nations all working in unison under UN control,
[3:17:56.920 --> 3:18:07.920]  established a medical planetary dictatorship. At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations, themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families,
[3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:11.920]  the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that.
[3:18:11.920 --> 3:18:15.920]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time.
[3:18:15.920 --> 3:18:22.920]  But they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[3:18:22.920 --> 3:18:26.920]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:31.920]  They're involved in plotting the world economy. That's what the social distancing, the master all about.
[3:18:31.920 --> 3:18:37.920]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that comply are complying with your own destruction. Wake up.
[3:18:37.920 --> 3:18:40.920]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses.
[3:18:40.920 --> 3:18:46.920]  They want control. They want domesticated slaves. That's the process that is taking place right now.
[3:18:46.920 --> 3:18:53.920]  And when you shop at the big box stores and when you shop with Amazon, remember that they are creating monopolies
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:18:58.920]  and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns, gun control, abortion, world government, all of it.
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:00.920]  And if you want to do that, go ahead and shop there.
[3:19:00.920 --> 3:19:07.920]  But if you'll shop at InfoWars or we have thousands of products made right here in America with our warehouses and our crew,
[3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:09.920]  it's incredible and it changes the whole world.
[3:19:09.920 --> 3:19:12.920]  So do your shopping if you want to fund the InfoWars.
[3:19:12.920 --> 3:19:17.920]  If you want to stop the globalists at InfoWarsStore.com and tell others to do their shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:19:17.920 --> 3:19:23.920]  We have amazing products. We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas if you order by the 18th.
[3:19:23.920 --> 3:19:25.920]  So again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:19:25.920 --> 3:19:29.920]  I want to thank you for thinking through what you do and where you spend your money and do your shopping
[3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:31.920]  and get great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:19:31.920 --> 3:19:36.920]  InfoWars.com
[3:20:01.920 --> 3:20:04.920]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[3:20:04.920 --> 3:20:07.920]  This is economic domination. This is economic war.
[3:20:07.920 --> 3:20:09.920]  We are being consolidated. We are being taken over.
[3:20:09.920 --> 3:20:12.920]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[3:20:12.920 --> 3:20:18.920]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal
[3:20:18.920 --> 3:20:22.920]  and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[3:20:22.920 --> 3:20:25.920]  This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is.
[3:20:25.920 --> 3:20:28.920]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[3:20:28.920 --> 3:20:32.920]  That's what social distancing is, so your business is only at 25%.
[3:20:32.920 --> 3:20:35.920]  For several more years, no small businesses will be there.
[3:20:35.920 --> 3:20:37.920]  This is a master plan. Say no.
[3:20:41.920 --> 3:20:44.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:52.920 --> 3:20:57.920]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:20:57.920 --> 3:20:59.920]  with Summit.News.
[3:21:01.920 --> 3:21:07.920]  Now, finishing up on this vaccine conversation with the rollout of several new vaccines
[3:21:07.920 --> 3:21:12.920]  across the Western world, the first person vaccinated with the coronavirus vaccine.
[3:21:12.920 --> 3:21:18.920]  In the UK today, we have CNN putting out an article and we have this headline up on Summit.News.
[3:21:18.920 --> 3:21:25.920]  CNN, don't be alarmed if people start dying after taking the vaccine.
[3:21:25.920 --> 3:21:27.920]  Move along, nothing to see here.
[3:21:27.920 --> 3:21:32.920]  They're getting out in advance of people potentially dying from taking the vaccine and saying,
[3:21:32.920 --> 3:21:38.920]  it's completely normal in an article on the COVID vaccine rollout.
[3:21:38.920 --> 3:21:43.920]  CNN says that Americans shouldn't be alarmed if people start dying after taking the vaccine
[3:21:43.920 --> 3:21:49.920]  because deaths may occur that won't necessarily have anything to do with the vaccine.
[3:21:49.920 --> 3:21:56.920]  Now, this was put out in an article titled Why Vaccinate Our Most Frail in which Dr. Kelly Moore
[3:21:56.920 --> 3:22:01.920]  cautions that vaccines don't work as well on the frail and elderly compared to healthy people.
[3:22:01.920 --> 3:22:06.920]  She said, quote, or the report said, quote, when shots begin to go into the arms of residents,
[3:22:06.920 --> 3:22:12.920]  more said Americans need to understand that deaths may occur that won't necessarily have anything to do with the vaccine.
[3:22:12.920 --> 3:22:19.920]  Moore herself said, quote, we would not all be surprised to see coincidentally, just a coincidence,
[3:22:19.920 --> 3:22:24.920]  vaccination happening and then having someone pass away a short time after they receive a vaccine,
[3:22:24.920 --> 3:22:31.920]  not because it has anything to do with the vaccination, but just because that's the place where people at the end of their lives reside.
[3:22:31.920 --> 3:22:37.920]  She then said Americans shouldn't be alarmed to see people dying a day or two after receiving the COVID vaccination.
[3:22:37.920 --> 3:22:44.920]  One of the things we want to make sure people understand is that they should not be unnecessarily alarmed if there are reports.
[3:22:44.920 --> 3:22:51.920]  Once we start vaccinating, if someone or multiple people dying within a day or two of their vaccination,
[3:22:51.920 --> 3:22:56.920]  who are residents of a long-term care facility, that would be something we would expect as a normal occurrence
[3:22:56.920 --> 3:22:59.920]  because people die frequently in nursing homes.
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:06.920]  The problem with that is it's the same argument anti-lockdown advocates have been making all along.
[3:23:06.920 --> 3:23:16.920]  The fact that deaths in care homes are being ascribed to COVID and yet the victims have multiple comorbidities.
[3:23:16.920 --> 3:23:19.920]  So again, this is the argument that we've been making all along.
[3:23:19.920 --> 3:23:28.920]  Why would you ascribe it to COVID when in many cases it's obvious that COVID only brought their death maybe two or three weeks closer?
[3:23:28.920 --> 3:23:34.920]  You have to account for the comorbidities, but apparently that doesn't apply when they're taking a vaccine.
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:39.920]  So if they take the vaccine and then die a couple of days later, it was because they're all,
[3:23:39.920 --> 3:23:44.920]  it was because they're in a nursing home and it was because they had multiple comorbidities.
[3:23:44.920 --> 3:23:48.920]  That was the reason it had nothing to do with the vaccine.
[3:23:48.920 --> 3:23:54.920]  And again, lockdown skeptics have been making the argument for months and months and months,
[3:23:54.920 --> 3:23:58.920]  shouted down for doing so. Apparently COVID was the prime suspect.
[3:23:58.920 --> 3:24:03.920]  Forget about the comorbidities and yet now they're saying the exact same thing about the vaccine.
[3:24:03.920 --> 3:24:07.920]  If people start to die, don't question the vaccine.
[3:24:07.920 --> 3:24:09.920]  It's because they're old and ill.
[3:24:09.920 --> 3:24:13.920]  But just because they're old and ill, that also means that COVID killed them.
[3:24:13.920 --> 3:24:16.920]  Don't question any of the other comorbidities.
[3:24:16.920 --> 3:24:19.920]  Quite the logic flip going on there.
[3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:27.920]  Meanwhile, Zero Hedge reports, FDA says two participants in Pfizer COVID vaccine trial have died.
[3:24:27.920 --> 3:24:36.920]  The FDA expected to grant emergency use approval for the Pfizer COVID vaccine after releasing a preliminary assessment of the trial data.
[3:24:36.920 --> 3:24:42.920]  The agency admitted Tuesday that two participants in the phase three trials have died.
[3:24:42.920 --> 3:24:44.920]  One of them was immunocompromised.
[3:24:44.920 --> 3:24:49.920]  The FDA is expected to release two separate assessments of the trial data.
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:53.920]  This comes after they also warned of a severe adverse reaction,
[3:24:53.920 --> 3:24:57.920]  frequently seen in patients after taking the second dose.
[3:24:57.920 --> 3:25:03.920]  So people, some of them unhealthy, some of them healthy have already started to die in the trials alone.
[3:25:03.920 --> 3:25:07.920]  Then we have the question of the lockdown itself.
[3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:12.920]  Now, of course, we've just come out of the second national lockdown here in the UK.
[3:25:12.920 --> 3:25:15.920]  They're already talking about a third lockdown.
[3:25:15.920 --> 3:25:18.920]  They're going to give us a few days over Christmas.
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:24.920]  Well, thank you, government. Thank you a few days over Christmas to see our relatives.
[3:25:24.920 --> 3:25:29.920]  But the talk has already begun about a third lockdown after Christmas,
[3:25:29.920 --> 3:25:37.920]  basically punishing us for having a few days, a sliver of freedom over the festive period.
[3:25:37.920 --> 3:25:43.920]  Now headline says more coronacases in London at the end of lockdown than before it started.
[3:25:43.920 --> 3:25:49.920]  So we have more infections after the one month lockdown than before it was implemented.
[3:25:49.920 --> 3:25:51.920]  So what was the point?
[3:25:51.920 --> 3:25:56.920]  If it doesn't work, why do we keep doing it over and over again?
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:26:02.920]  Health experts tracking the effectiveness of the UK's latest lockdown say there were more COVID cases in London
[3:26:02.920 --> 3:26:05.920]  when the lockdown ended compared to when it started.
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:10.920]  Their solution, well, guess what it is? It's another lockdown.
[3:26:10.920 --> 3:26:13.920]  London entered a second national lockdown on November 5th.
[3:26:13.920 --> 3:26:16.920]  That was lifted, lifted.
[3:26:16.920 --> 3:26:20.920]  Most of the country is still in a de facto lockdown under tier three.
[3:26:20.920 --> 3:26:23.920]  London went back into tier two on December 2nd.
[3:26:23.920 --> 3:26:27.920]  However, it appears to have no impact whatsoever.
[3:26:27.920 --> 3:26:33.920]  Less than a week after coming out of lockdown, London may be about to enter another one because of a rise in coronavirus cases.
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:40.920]  The capital is now the second worst region in the country with more than 15,000 people testing positive in the past week.
[3:26:40.920 --> 3:26:46.920]  So this professor responded to this, the fact that the lockdown had no impact whatsoever.
[3:26:46.920 --> 3:26:54.920]  And in fact, the infections were worse after it ended by saying that we need another lockdown.
[3:26:54.920 --> 3:27:01.920]  Professor Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia said there were more cases at the end of lockdown than at the start.
[3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:04.920]  What's the solution? Another lockdown.
[3:27:04.920 --> 3:27:06.920]  And then there'll be more cases after that.
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:11.920]  And the solution to that will be a fourth lockdown, lockdowns forever and ever and ever.
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:16.920]  And then, of course, if enough people don't take the vaccine, well, then that's their fault.
[3:27:16.920 --> 3:27:22.920]  And then we need another lockdown or maybe just a de facto lockdown for the people who haven't taken the vaccine.
[3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:24.920]  And that's the entire point.
[3:27:24.920 --> 3:27:30.920]  If tier two, tier three lockdowns mean you can't go to the pub, you can't go to the restaurant,
[3:27:30.920 --> 3:27:35.920]  you can't go to the sports game, you can't go to the cinema, you can't see your loved ones.
[3:27:35.920 --> 3:27:40.920]  And those people who don't take the vaccine are going to be back under those restrictions anyway.
[3:27:40.920 --> 3:27:43.920]  Then what is that other than de facto house arrest?
[3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:45.920]  So then they'll probably trot that out.
[3:27:45.920 --> 3:27:50.920]  As I said earlier, they'll probably say, well, we're back in lockdown and it's your fault for not taking the vaccine.
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:54.920]  Or the people who took the vaccine, they'll be out of lockdown.
[3:27:54.920 --> 3:28:04.920]  Meanwhile, your social life, your right to mobility will be completely eviscerated forever until you take the vaccine.
[3:28:04.920 --> 3:28:09.920]  We had Wales, of course, they imposed the 17-day firebreak lockdown.
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:12.920]  They just named it something differently. It was still a lockdown.
[3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:15.920]  Now they're saying that Wales needs another lockdown.
[3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:17.920]  What was the point in the first one?
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:23.920]  Every single time it fails, every single time we have a new lockdown.
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:27.920]  Meanwhile, Sweden still has the lowest death rate in Scandinavia.
[3:28:27.920 --> 3:28:32.920]  They had no significant lockdown, but apparently Sweden doesn't exist.
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:38.920]  Rand Paul says, no scientific evidence, tyrannical lockdowns work.
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:40.920]  This was an appearance on Fox News.
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:44.920]  He said we ought to at least still use logic to try to figure out how we stop this.
[3:28:44.920 --> 3:28:49.920]  He said, I don't see any evidence that crowd control, hand washing, standing six feet apart.
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:51.920]  All of these things they tell you to do.
[3:28:51.920 --> 3:28:54.920]  Closing down the restaurants, closing down the schools.
[3:28:54.920 --> 3:28:59.920]  There's no real evidence that they are changing the trajectory of the disease.
[3:28:59.920 --> 3:29:03.920]  Continue to say, if you look at the incidence of COVID, it's going up exponentially,
[3:29:03.920 --> 3:29:11.920]  despite all the mandates of those who say there are signs behind the restrictions just on paying attention to it.
[3:29:11.920 --> 3:29:14.920]  Then we have the enforcement of the lockdown.
[3:29:14.920 --> 3:29:21.920]  In London over the past week, we had it lifted last week on Wednesday, we went back into tier two.
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:25.920]  So basically then the police were out patrolling the pubs,
[3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:31.920]  ordering people to leave pubs and restaurants immediately after they'd finished their meals,
[3:29:31.920 --> 3:29:36.920]  because they brought in this ridiculous measure which said that if you're drinking alcohol in pubs,
[3:29:36.920 --> 3:29:40.920]  pubs have to serve a, quote, substantial meal.
[3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:49.920]  They then had this farce of ministers basically admitting that a Scotch egg did constitute a substantial meal.
[3:29:49.920 --> 3:29:53.920]  So everybody was ordering a Scotch egg and 10 pints of lager.
[3:29:53.920 --> 3:29:58.920]  So that led to the police literally patrolling pubs and kicking people out of pubs
[3:29:58.920 --> 3:30:03.920]  as soon as they finished their meal to prevent them from ordering more drinks.
[3:30:03.920 --> 3:30:09.920]  Now we have UK police using number plate cameras to track down people visiting pubs in neighbouring areas.
[3:30:09.920 --> 3:30:16.920]  So those people are basically under full tier three lockdown if they live close to the border of another area,
[3:30:16.920 --> 3:30:20.920]  which is under tier two lockdown where they can go to the pub, to the restaurant,
[3:30:20.920 --> 3:30:23.920]  and enjoy their Scotch egg and 20 pints of lager.
[3:30:23.920 --> 3:30:28.920]  Those people are being tracked by number plate tracking cameras
[3:30:28.920 --> 3:30:33.920]  and then the police are turning up to go after them completely Orwellian police day and it's only getting worse.
[3:30:33.920 --> 3:30:36.920]  Don't go away. Summit.News will be right back.
[3:30:36.920 --> 3:30:40.920]  If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year,
[3:30:40.920 --> 3:30:43.920]  just wait until you see the year 2021.
[3:30:43.920 --> 3:30:48.920]  I'm Alex Jones. I started in full wars but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[3:30:48.920 --> 3:30:53.920]  And now in full wars is more important than ever because the general population of the planet
[3:30:53.920 --> 3:30:56.920]  is weighing up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on.
[3:30:56.920 --> 3:31:02.920]  That's why it's so important to those of you out there that have supported the broadcast and the websites and the films
[3:31:02.920 --> 3:31:06.920]  and all the rest of the information we put out to realize how important your work has been
[3:31:06.920 --> 3:31:09.920]  and to redouble your efforts. So I salute you and I thank you.
[3:31:09.920 --> 3:31:12.920]  Also, as Christmas is almost here, don't wait.

[3:31:36.920 --> 3:31:42.920]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control.
[3:31:42.920 --> 3:31:51.920]  There's a headline out from zero hedge that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year
[3:31:51.920 --> 3:31:55.920]  by the end of December. It's already over $130 billion they've lost.
[3:31:55.920 --> 3:32:01.920]  Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria if it hurts them?
[3:32:01.920 --> 3:32:04.920]  Well, see, that'll knock out all the small airlines that have solid air control
[3:32:04.920 --> 3:32:09.920]  and it's the same in every single industry. And the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[3:32:09.920 --> 3:32:13.920]  They want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[3:32:13.920 --> 3:32:18.920]  That's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some central banks.
[3:32:18.920 --> 3:32:21.920]  This is how the globalists take control.
[3:32:21.920 --> 3:32:26.920]  It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare
[3:32:26.920 --> 3:32:32.920]  and it gives cover to the big megabanks to create thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivation.
[3:32:32.920 --> 3:32:37.920]  Only the truth will set us free. infowars.com
[3:32:37.920 --> 3:32:41.920]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses.
[3:32:41.920 --> 3:32:47.920]  They want control. They want domesticated slaves. That's the process that is taking place right now.
[3:32:47.920 --> 3:32:53.920]  And when you shop at the big box stores and when you shop with Amazon, remember that they are creating monopolies
[3:32:53.920 --> 3:32:59.920]  and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns, gun control, abortion, world government, all of it.
[3:32:59.920 --> 3:33:01.920]  And if you want to do that, go ahead and shop there.
[3:33:01.920 --> 3:33:05.920]  But if you'll shop at infowars, where we have thousands of products made right here in America
[3:33:05.920 --> 3:33:10.920]  with our warehouses and our crew, it's incredible and it changes the whole world.
[3:33:10.920 --> 3:33:15.920]  So do your shopping if you want to fund the info board, if you want to stop the globalist at infowarstore.com
[3:33:15.920 --> 3:33:18.920]  and tell others to do their shopping at infowars.com.
[3:33:18.920 --> 3:33:23.920]  We have amazing products. We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas if you order by the 18th.
[3:33:23.920 --> 3:33:27.920]  So again, I want to thank you all for your support. I want to thank you for thinking through what you do
[3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:32.920]  and where you spend your money and do your shopping and get great products at infowars.com.
[3:33:37.920 --> 3:33:40.920]  The great reset. Where have I heard of that before?
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:47.920]  Oh, the great leap forward, Mao Zedong ordering all the small towns and small farms
[3:33:47.920 --> 3:33:52.920]  to basically shut down and have the rural people and the small business people move into the big cities
[3:33:52.920 --> 3:33:55.920]  and go under communist commune control.
[3:33:55.920 --> 3:34:00.920]  And that's all this is. The big mega banks want to break us into the same ones that put Mao Zedong into power
[3:34:00.920 --> 3:34:04.920]  and they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy and bringing in the new economy
[3:34:04.920 --> 3:34:09.920]  where everything's free because when you're a prisoner, well, everything's free but you're also a slave.
[3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:14.920]  Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level.
[3:34:14.920 --> 3:34:17.920]  But of course, you've got to take those vaccines. You can't have any kids.
[3:34:17.920 --> 3:34:24.920]  And oh, don't worry though, all of the tampons and stuff like that is free too as well. I'm not kidding.
[3:34:24.920 --> 3:34:29.920]  So give me some free paper. Give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment but they own you.
[3:34:29.920 --> 3:34:34.920]  They control you. That's the great reset. That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover.
[3:34:34.920 --> 3:34:40.920]  We're fighting it at infowars.com.
[3:34:40.920 --> 3:34:48.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:59.920]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:05.920]  We're back live and now we're going to switch to another topic which is basically PLM,
[3:35:05.920 --> 3:35:08.920]  another prediction that I made a few months ago.
[3:35:08.920 --> 3:35:10.920]  It came true over the weekend.
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:16.920]  Basically, we've had privileged overpaid premiership footballers and other footballers
[3:35:16.920 --> 3:35:23.920]  needing, taking a knee for Black Lives Matter before every soccer game for the past six months.
[3:35:23.920 --> 3:35:27.920]  They're still doing it. They're still doing it six months later.
[3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:33.920]  Nobody really knows why. The prediction I made was that as soon as they let fans back into the stadiums,
[3:35:33.920 --> 3:35:38.920]  they would boo the players when they took a knee for Black Lives Matter.
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:44.920]  And that's precisely what happened on Saturday at several football grounds around the United Kingdom,
[3:35:44.920 --> 3:35:50.920]  including West Ham Colchester and Millwall, where they took a knee and then in the aftermath,
[3:35:50.920 --> 3:35:55.920]  particularly Millwall supporters were completely demonized and harangued by the media,
[3:35:55.920 --> 3:36:00.920]  said, how dare you? How dare you disagree with Black Lives Matter?
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:07.920]  You must be racist against Black people because if you don't support the political organization Black Lives Matter,
[3:36:07.920 --> 3:36:10.920]  that must mean you hate Black people, right?
[3:36:10.920 --> 3:36:17.920]  I mean, it has nothing to do with the fact that Black Lives Matter demonstrators in London on numerous occasions
[3:36:17.920 --> 3:36:26.920]  were caught on camera desecrating war memorials, setting fire to Union Jack flags, viciously attacking police officers,
[3:36:26.920 --> 3:36:34.920]  and staring down statues with the complete advocacy and apologism of the mainstream media, of course.
[3:36:34.920 --> 3:36:38.920]  No, it's nothing to do with that. That's not why people don't like Black Lives Matter.
[3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:44.920]  They just hate Black people. I mean, it doesn't matter that literally half of football teams now,
[3:36:44.920 --> 3:36:48.920]  comprised of Black people, is basically the same as the NBA.
[3:36:48.920 --> 3:36:55.920]  Those supporters go to those games. They literally pay money that goes to pay the wages of those Black players.
[3:36:55.920 --> 3:37:02.920]  They sing their names in the stand. But no, if you don't support the players taking a knee for Black Lives Matter,
[3:37:02.920 --> 3:37:07.920]  that must mean you hate Black people. No, it doesn't. It means you hate Black Lives Matter,
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:15.920]  which every sane person, sane thinking person should at this point, headline of BBC Sport.
[3:37:15.920 --> 3:37:17.920]  And they were very furious about this.
[3:37:17.920 --> 3:37:23.920]  Millwall and QPR players to stand arm in arm to show solidarity before Tuesday's match.
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:28.920]  And this is tonight. This is literally just happened about 30 minutes ago.
[3:37:28.920 --> 3:37:33.920]  Millwall players will not take a knee before Tuesday's championship fixture against QPR,
[3:37:33.920 --> 3:37:39.920]  but will stand arm in arm in a show of solidarity for football's fight against discrimination.
[3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:47.920]  What discrimination? Literally half of the players on the teams now are Black. It's like the NBA.
[3:37:47.920 --> 3:37:54.920]  Black people are overrepresented in football, and that's perfectly fine if it's on the merits
[3:37:54.920 --> 3:38:00.920]  of being physically competent in terms of sports, like it is with the NBA or American football.
[3:38:00.920 --> 3:38:05.920]  That's perfectly fine. But there's no discrimination in football,
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:09.920]  preventing Black people from getting into it, from rising to the top,
[3:38:09.920 --> 3:38:13.920]  given that literally half of the teams are now made up of Black people,
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:19.920]  and the demographics of the United Kingdom are still something like 85% White.
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:24.920]  If the football teams are 50% Black and the demographics of the country are 85% White,
[3:38:24.920 --> 3:38:28.920]  that suggests that there's not a lot of discrimination,
[3:38:28.920 --> 3:38:35.920]  not a lot of racism going on if Black people are way overperforming when it comes to competitive sports.
[3:38:35.920 --> 3:38:41.920]  But no. According to the BBC, Gary Lineker and all these other woke, virtue signaling celebrities,
[3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:46.920]  apparently all these fans across the country were just booing them because they hate Black people.
[3:38:46.920 --> 3:38:52.920]  Not because they desecrate war memorials, punch police officers in the face, throw objects at them,
[3:38:52.920 --> 3:38:57.920]  tear down statues in the streets. No, it's because they hate Black people.
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:39:06.920]  The added irony to this, of course, is that Nike sponsors a lot of these footballers in terms of their boot sponsorship deals
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:12.920]  and other sponsorship deals. Nike literally still profits off third world modern slavery.
[3:39:12.920 --> 3:39:16.920]  They'll virtue signal all day long about how much they care about Black Lives Matter,
[3:39:16.920 --> 3:39:25.920]  while literally using slave labor from Uighur Muslims in China who are in reeducation detention camps.
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:32.920]  Oh, but that's a good woke corporation. We had this headline a few days ago.
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:39.920]  Woke corporations who supported BLM lobby against ban on Chinese slave labor.
[3:39:39.920 --> 3:39:46.920]  So the US government is basically trying to introduce a law called the Uighur Force Labor Prevention Act,
[3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:53.920]  which bans the import of goods produced in Xinjiang where companies cannot prove they were not made by slave labor.
[3:39:53.920 --> 3:39:56.920]  You think that everybody across the board would support that, right?
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:40:02.920]  You don't want your company connected to and profiting from modern slavery. No.
[3:40:02.920 --> 3:40:09.920]  Amazon, Apple and Nike, they hate it. They want that pipeline of slave labor to continue.
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:13.920]  Oh, but they'll support BLM in the United States.
[3:40:13.920 --> 3:40:24.920]  They'll put out a tweet, but when it comes to actually discriminating against brown people who were literally enslaved in brainwashing camps by the communist Chinese government,
[3:40:24.920 --> 3:40:33.920]  not so concerned, not so concerned and still sponsoring all these Premier League footballers who bow for BLM.
[3:40:33.920 --> 3:40:37.920]  Meanwhile, the company sponsoring them in the case of Nike,
[3:40:37.920 --> 3:40:44.920]  according to an Australian Strategic Policy Institute study, found that Apple and Nike were beneficiaries of, quote,
[3:40:44.920 --> 3:40:48.920]  abusive labor transfer programs involving Uighurs.
[3:40:48.920 --> 3:40:55.920]  So they're literally still profiting and refusing to eliminate modern slavery from their supply chains.
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:40:59.920]  But they're woke in the United States. They're woke in the United Kingdom.
[3:40:59.920 --> 3:41:07.920]  They'll put out a tweet in the case of Nike. They'll grandstand in terms of Colin Kaepernick. They'll support him.
[3:41:07.920 --> 3:41:09.920]  They'll give him tens of millions of dollars.
[3:41:09.920 --> 3:41:20.920]  That makes them a good, woke, wholesome corporation while they literally make money of slaves who are in detention camps undergoing forced labor in China.
[3:41:20.920 --> 3:41:23.920]  But what is everyone concerned about? Not concerned about that.
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:31.920]  Not concerned about literal slavery. Concerned about a handful of Millwall supporters booing players for taking a knee.
[3:41:31.920 --> 3:41:37.920]  Not because they hate black people because they hate black lives matter. The two are very different things.
[3:41:37.920 --> 3:41:40.920]  I mean, you've seen the makeup of it in the United Kingdom.
[3:41:40.920 --> 3:41:50.920]  You saw the London riots when they had these BLM demonstrations. 80% of them were white people anyway.
[3:41:50.920 --> 3:41:57.920]  Meanwhile, Twitter users label football a homophobic for destroying LGBT corner flag during celebration.
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:02.920]  This occurred again on the weekend and people were very furious about it.
[3:42:02.920 --> 3:42:09.920]  This is a Leicester City striker called Jamie Vardy, who scored a last minute winner in a football match.
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:15.920]  He's celebrated by going into the corner flag, sliding into it and breaking the corner flag.
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:23.920]  The problem is, atop this corner flag, there was a rainbow LGBT flag because apparently over the past week,
[3:42:23.920 --> 3:42:31.920]  all these sports broadcasters in the United Kingdom have made all their graphics packages or their little pin on badges.
[3:42:31.920 --> 3:42:35.920]  They've made all the corner flags. They've had the footballers.
[3:42:35.920 --> 3:42:42.920]  Their shoelaces are all colored in rainbow LGBT motifs because they really care about gay people.
[3:42:42.920 --> 3:42:48.920]  I mean, gay people are still being imprisoned and killed in numerous third world countries across the world,
[3:42:48.920 --> 3:42:54.920]  but we don't talk about that. We put little flags on the corner of football pitches and that makes us good people.
[3:42:54.920 --> 3:43:03.920]  And if you criticize this footballer for sliding into this flag, that also makes you a good person because he's apparently homophobic.
[3:43:03.920 --> 3:43:10.920]  Now, the truth is that this is a common celebration in football to slide into the corner flag.
[3:43:10.920 --> 3:43:15.920]  He just scored a last minute winner against a football team called Sheffield United.
[3:43:15.920 --> 3:43:19.920]  He's a Sheffield Wednesday fan. They're bitter rivals.
[3:43:19.920 --> 3:43:22.920]  So he was particularly excited at scoring the goal.
[3:43:22.920 --> 3:43:30.920]  This particular footballer has a history of either sliding into corner flags or boxing corner flags to celebrate a goal.
[3:43:30.920 --> 3:43:39.920]  But no, that's not what happened. He did it because he hates gay people and there were literally hundreds of tweets demanding he apologize.
[3:43:39.920 --> 3:43:44.920]  Meanwhile, Diversity Grove, Birmingham street names get woke.
[3:43:44.920 --> 3:43:53.920]  Birmingham City Council invited members of the public to come up with new street names for a regeneration scheme and guess what they came up with.
[3:43:53.920 --> 3:44:01.920]  Did they celebrate people in the local area, whether they be black people or brown people or white people for their achievements, for their success?
[3:44:01.920 --> 3:44:10.920]  No, they came out with glib statements and they're now literally renaming Rhodes Diversity Grove and Equality Road.
[3:44:10.920 --> 3:44:21.920]  Interesting, given that we featured a study out of the University of Copenhagen last year, which found that ethnic diversity is not a strength.
[3:44:21.920 --> 3:44:30.920]  Believe it or not, they asked whether continued mass immigration and corresponding growing ethnic diversity was having a positive impact on community cohesion.
[3:44:30.920 --> 3:44:34.920]  And they found the opposite to be the case.
[3:44:34.920 --> 3:44:36.920]  So it literally has the opposite effect.
[3:44:36.920 --> 3:44:46.920]  It's literally been proven by peer reviewed academic studies that no diversity is not a strength because it causes mistrust and it's related to high crime.
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:53.920]  Interesting, given that these streets were renamed in an area of Birmingham called Perry Bar.
[3:44:53.920 --> 3:45:03.920]  I looked up Perry Bar on Google News and it turns out that they've been having a lot of problems over the past few months with, yes, you guessed it, high crime rates,
[3:45:03.920 --> 3:45:13.920]  including over the past summer where robberies and firearms offences have increased, leading to police being handed section 60 powers to stop and search people without reasonable grounds.
[3:45:13.920 --> 3:45:21.920]  So in the very area where diversity has proven to not be a strength, they're naming the road Diversity Grove.
[3:45:21.920 --> 3:45:25.920]  It's been a wrap it up forum coming up next summit.news.
