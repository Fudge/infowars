[00:00.000 --> 00:16.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.800 --> 00:24.960]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:24.960 --> 00:33.280]  FBI Director Christopher Wray assumed the office in 2017 since then he has continuously failed and
[00:33.280 --> 00:40.000]  embarrassed the American people and I'm especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had
[00:40.000 --> 00:48.080]  their own chance to stop this monster back in 2015 and failed and that is inexcusable it never
[00:48.080 --> 00:52.240]  should have happened and we're doing everything in our power to make sure it never happens again
[00:52.240 --> 00:59.040]  Wray's predecessors include Andrew McCabe who lied under oath the solemnly swear the testimony
[00:59.040 --> 01:02.800]  about give this committee is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth sir have you
[01:02.800 --> 01:10.080]  gone I did James Comey who protected the Clinton crime family the organization was in disarray
[01:10.800 --> 01:16.640]  that it was poorly led that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader and Robert Mueller
[01:16.640 --> 01:22.240]  who fueled an impeachment scam of epic proportions in one of these meetings mr. Papadopoulos is
[01:22.240 --> 01:29.120]  talking to a foreign diplomat and he tells the diplomat russians have dirt on clinton that
[01:29.120 --> 01:35.280]  diplomat then contacts the FBI and the FBI opens an investigation based on that fact he
[01:35.280 --> 01:51.200]  point this out on page one of the report would you give me one minute the revelation surrounding
[01:51.200 --> 01:59.120]  the Larry Nasser abuse scandal where at least 265 girls were repeatedly sexually abused by
[01:59.120 --> 02:05.920]  nasser who was the team doctor over 18 years only add to the fact that the FBI is a broken
[02:05.920 --> 02:12.480]  bureaucracy in particular the inspector general discovered that Michael Langman the supervisory
[02:12.480 --> 02:18.720]  special agent in the indianapolis office lied to investigators to cover up errors made in the
[02:18.720 --> 02:28.080]  bureau's investigation these elite athletes people whose names average americans and people around
[02:28.080 --> 02:37.920]  the world know if their allegations of sexual assault are not taken seriously in an investigation
[02:37.920 --> 02:43.920]  of this nature how can they have confidence that if something like this were to happen to them or
[02:43.920 --> 02:50.400]  their family or their loved one that that those allegations would be taken seriously i understand
[02:50.400 --> 02:58.800]  all too well that the FBI depends on the trust of the american people as most of you are probably
[02:58.800 --> 03:05.360]  aware i was molested by the u.s. gymnastics national team an olympic team doctor Larry Nasser
[03:05.360 --> 03:10.800]  in an actuality he turned out to be more of a pedophile than he was a doctor what i'm trying
[03:10.800 --> 03:16.320]  to bring to your attention today is something incredibly disturbing and illegal after telling
[03:16.320 --> 03:24.720]  my entire story of abuse to the FBI in the summer of 2015 not only did the FBI not report my abuse
[03:24.720 --> 03:31.840]  but when they eventually documented my report 17 months later they made entirely false claims
[03:31.840 --> 03:38.000]  about what i said while local agents tracked down serial killers the top brass of the FBI
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.280]  wage a war on patriotism a war that recently failed miserably at the justice for j6 rally
[03:45.280 --> 03:52.080]  that only exposed the bureau's increasing organization of plots to undermine america
[03:52.080 --> 03:57.040]  i tell you what the american people are not stupid we can see it with our own eyes the
[03:57.040 --> 04:01.120]  difference in the treatment from our federal government because of someone's political beliefs
[04:02.080 --> 04:06.880]  and that's regardless it's regardless of how the news media tries to spin it or the what they tell
[04:06.880 --> 04:14.000]  you the political leadership in this country it's a dirty secret okay when you're upset about a
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.480]  political problem and you're angry they actually want you to do what happened on january 6 they
[04:20.480 --> 04:26.720]  want violence from us they want us to cross the line they want us to destroy property you want us
[04:26.720 --> 04:33.520]  angry because when you break the law they can deal with you very easily the only person arrested
[04:33.520 --> 05:00.800]  at the justice for j6 rally you guessed it an FBI agent we're already halfway through september
[05:00.800 --> 05:07.280]  2021 it's just incredible and now the world is waking up that info wars was the tip of the

[06:13.280 --> 06:18.800]  info wars the most banned network in the world
[06:18.800 --> 06:32.240]  mark your calendars as the day the world stood still this broke yesterday afternoon
[06:33.200 --> 06:38.480]  and i normally have my nose the grindstone on news and information but i took care of a lot of
[06:38.480 --> 06:43.120]  technical business and things around here and infrastructure to keep this operation afloat
[06:43.120 --> 06:49.120]  and so i did not know about it until late last night and then i couldn't sleep all night and i did
[06:49.120 --> 06:56.640]  approximately five hours of research on this and i can tell you unequivocally this story is
[06:57.760 --> 07:02.880]  ten times bigger than anything else you've ever reported this is bigger than us exposing the
[07:02.880 --> 07:08.080]  global authority radical islam on 9 11 this is bigger than them lying about wmds when i rack this
[07:08.080 --> 07:14.080]  is bigger than the german government working for the u.s government giving 30 000 children to convicted
[07:14.080 --> 07:19.760]  pedophiles for sex rings this is bigger than all the autistic children in them knowing that mercury
[07:19.760 --> 07:26.240]  was causing autism in boys passing the blood rain barrier this is bigger than dropping atomic bombs
[07:26.240 --> 07:35.200]  on harashima and nagasaki this is bigger than the cold war this is bigger than world war two
[07:35.200 --> 07:44.560]  this is the biggest thing in modern world history and you can argue if they succeed
[07:45.280 --> 07:50.400]  it is the biggest thing in history other than jesus christ
[07:55.680 --> 08:00.160]  when i saw this yesterday i was going to bed early i was tired i'd only gotten five hours
[08:00.160 --> 08:05.440]  sleep getting back from dc waking up you're going to bed at one in the morning getting up at six in
[08:05.440 --> 08:12.720]  the morning and i was energized like electricity shot into me the london telegraph and i didn't
[08:12.720 --> 08:17.520]  just believe the telegraph i already knew all the backstory but that darpa released documents
[08:20.720 --> 08:22.320]  darpa released documents
[08:22.320 --> 08:30.720]  that falchie and peter dazik approached them
[08:33.760 --> 08:40.800]  three years ago and said we want to release a chimeric coronavirus that's described as
[08:40.800 --> 08:53.120]  covid-19 purposely on to the people in china whoa and that's why when they started to get caught
[08:53.120 --> 08:57.920]  six months ago they shipped it from saying oh it wasn't a lab leak it happened in a grocery
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.560]  market a wet market a live animal market to oh no it was the chinese government was an accident
[09:02.560 --> 09:09.440]  because they were doing it to set china up i'm sure now and i don't like to try comms and
[09:09.440 --> 09:15.440]  can't stand them but but now it's all clear i've got the whole story how obama created it how they
[09:15.440 --> 09:22.720]  had it at chapel hill the scientists got upset even the pentagon said don't do this they shipped it
[09:22.720 --> 09:28.640]  to china they developed it there further and then they brought grants to darpa saying we want to
[09:28.640 --> 09:35.680]  create nanotech that delivers viruses through spike proteins that will go through human skin
[09:35.680 --> 09:42.880]  so we can spray it on people and they're talking about a bio weapon and darpa said this will endanger
[09:42.880 --> 09:53.200]  the humans of earth we will not do this do you understand this and what did general flin say
[09:54.160 --> 09:59.920]  well he hadn't said it publicly but he said it to quite a few folks and i agree with his sources
[09:59.920 --> 10:07.440]  and i've checked he said a month ago this is a synthetic nanovirus and i want him on the show
[10:07.440 --> 10:11.680]  or i want him out there who told him that because that's what this is a synthetic nanovirus that
[10:11.680 --> 10:15.520]  goes through the damn skin and that's what flin told medical doctors that have told me including
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.960]  one of my treating physicians who's very high level i'll leave it that and i'm not blowing
[10:20.960 --> 10:25.280]  sources here this is all known i was told this by other pentagon sources high level high level
[10:25.280 --> 10:31.120]  people in the sea i say no we know it's really a global consortium it's a synthetic nanovirus and
[10:31.120 --> 10:39.120]  now the pentagon and darpa released the smoking gun on fauci's ass that he had dazik come to them
[10:40.080 --> 10:44.560]  and say we want to create this and secretly release it in china and they said are you crazy the
[10:44.560 --> 10:52.320]  chinese onukas you maniacs remember the whole world's the target of this so no wonder they're
[10:52.320 --> 11:01.760]  covering up and no wonder because it's obama holy hell and there's the patents on mrna vaccine
[11:01.760 --> 11:09.040]  delivery using lipid nanoparticles so i i mean you have to understand something they can't
[11:09.040 --> 11:12.400]  even respond to this you know how the liberal media is responding mainstream news the late
[11:12.400 --> 11:18.000]  night comics all their minions that are paid off by big pharma on record uh that are on youtube
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.760]  they get force fed everybody i wouldn't check them on the play clips later they go you know you've
[11:21.760 --> 11:27.040]  heard the fake news about resigning fda scientist you've heard the news about them voting against
[11:27.040 --> 11:32.800]  the booster shots it's just not true it's fake and we're not going to debate those fake scientists
[11:32.800 --> 11:38.800]  that joe rogan interviews that's word for word i'll play it later next hour and of course they did
[11:38.800 --> 11:43.360]  resign the two head scientist and they did vote 16 to two against the booster shots and said this
[11:43.360 --> 11:47.600]  is a failing drug and it's going to discredit vaccines for generations i mean that that all happened
[11:47.600 --> 11:53.360]  okay but they sit there here's one of the groups you know who these people are to see them force
[11:53.360 --> 12:01.360]  fed the feeds uh this is uh sam harris crashes brett weinstein with alex jones comparisons

[18:10.000 --> 18:16.400]  here is is that he didn't act alone he felt that he was safe to talk on an overseas phone line
[18:16.400 --> 18:20.880]  system that he knew was being watched by not just our government the five eyes the russians
[18:21.440 --> 18:26.160]  and the chinese he wanted the world to know that he was proud of what he was doing because he was
[18:26.160 --> 18:31.600]  backed by the deep state this permanent bureaucracy sees america as its enemy it sees the american
[18:31.600 --> 18:37.280]  people as its enemy it sees prosperity as its entity and it conspired with the communist chinese
[18:37.280 --> 18:42.880]  to threaten them basically and say trump may nuke you but if he tries we'll call and say we're
[18:42.880 --> 18:48.720]  attacking you so you can respond first that's beyond treason but it shows the type of anti-american

[18:53.680 --> 19:00.800]  accomplices need to go to prison now for life we've all heard about the pastor and his famous
[19:00.800 --> 19:06.400]  statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that when they came for one group he
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.320]  wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another group he wasn't
[19:10.320 --> 19:15.440]  part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally when they came for him there was nobody
[19:15.440 --> 19:19.600]  else to stand up well the global social credit score the china splitting in it's banning people

[19:28.480 --> 19:33.440]  the vaccine passports they even admit it now they're saying it's going to be a carbon tax
[19:33.440 --> 19:37.440]  attached to it they're going to track where you go what you do and decide where you can go and what
[19:37.440 --> 19:43.360]  you can do that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again
[19:43.360 --> 19:47.280]  the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're
[19:47.280 --> 19:51.120]  part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well
[19:51.120 --> 19:55.200]  we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by
[19:55.200 --> 20:08.000]  this horrible technocracy run by the globalist you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:08.000 --> 20:22.800]  all right
[20:25.200 --> 20:31.120]  i'm asking every listener who's watching this live on september 22nd on this wednesday broadcast
[20:31.120 --> 20:38.160]  at 11 20 central time to call your friends your family your neighbor to hit your whole text message
[20:38.160 --> 20:44.160]  list to to take the live feed let's put it back on screen please and to share that link that they
[20:44.160 --> 20:50.480]  dread and they hate that the tyrants want to destroy biggest story of the 21st century biggest
[20:50.480 --> 20:56.160]  story of the 21st century i've never put five exclamation points up for a live show feed title
[20:56.160 --> 21:04.640]  never put two up i don't think DARPA pentagon have blown whistle on secret plan to release
[21:04.640 --> 21:13.360]  covid 19 foutsies right hand man dr peter dazik sought DARPA's approval to release a deadly
[21:13.360 --> 21:21.200]  covid virus into the wild the foutsie controlled project sought to target humans with quote skin
[21:21.200 --> 21:30.000]  piercing nano particles to deliver chimeric chimeric weapons tune in now and spread this link
[21:30.720 --> 21:38.000]  if you want to bring the criminals to justice or if you don't want to die and again i have been told
[21:39.200 --> 21:45.520]  by a lot of people that would have access to classified information and back when peter dazik
[21:45.520 --> 21:52.880]  approached the DARPA and the pentagon about releasing this bio weapon onto the chinese
[21:53.520 --> 21:56.160]  and they said no i'm going to read you all the mainstream news articles here in a moment that
[21:56.160 --> 21:59.440]  they're desperate you don't learn about this is hiding in plain view but it's like barely a big
[21:59.440 --> 22:06.400]  story it's just oh big deal i have talked to medical doctors i've talked to scientists i've
[22:06.400 --> 22:12.560]  talked to people currently in army special operations and currently who are good people most of them
[22:12.560 --> 22:17.680]  aren't uh in the cia and they said no it's it's real i've been i've been told this four months ago
[22:18.400 --> 22:24.400]  and i've been told it since that nano particles that are nano spike proteins artificially produced
[22:24.400 --> 22:30.400]  that do replicate but they only shed to three or four people and then they lose their effectiveness
[22:30.400 --> 22:36.240]  they've been designed to degrade a kind of like a neutron bomb you've detonated it only kills people
[22:36.240 --> 22:41.280]  with the radiation it only kills life but then the infrastructure is still there well it's like a
[22:41.280 --> 22:48.080]  bio weapon that has a half life that's nano tech and i kept getting told this and and and then i was
[22:48.080 --> 22:59.280]  told this by a doctor that runs a hospital who also happens to be my treating physician and he
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.920]  met with a bunch of intelligence heads in michigan a month ago i talked to him while he was there he
[23:03.920 --> 23:08.320]  called me and told me the same thing again i'm like okay i'm gonna tell everybody so i told you
[23:08.320 --> 23:13.280]  that the big brains i've said this 50 times probably are saying it's a nano spike protein
[23:14.240 --> 23:19.760]  the pentagon in darpa that's the group just released the documents that falchi and dazzic
[23:19.760 --> 23:25.120]  developed a synthetic spike protein delivery system for another virus contained within it
[23:26.160 --> 23:31.840]  that is a combination of five viruses exactly the same viruses that make covet 19 and they
[23:31.840 --> 23:37.680]  describe it as a covet coronavirus delivery system chimeric virus uh that has the special
[23:37.680 --> 23:46.960]  spike protein to infect humans wow wow and the reason i'm going back to that is you've heard
[23:46.960 --> 23:53.760]  me say over and over again but that none of that even matters now it's confirmed it's just hiding
[23:53.760 --> 23:59.600]  in the london telegraph and it's in a few new you newest newspapers that oh yeah that falchi's
[23:59.600 --> 24:04.400]  group wanted to release it and they wanted it made to infect humans and they wanted it released
[24:04.400 --> 24:10.960]  and the pentagon in darpa said are you crazy you'll kill people and then we'll have a war i'm
[24:10.960 --> 24:15.600]  going to read you the articles right now but i want everybody to tune in i want every you're
[24:15.600 --> 24:18.880]  the audience that's already awake you're the folks that tune in because you care there's people
[24:18.880 --> 24:22.880]  that can see the danger and feel the danger and understand i mean 60 minutes last night
[24:24.640 --> 24:27.680]  had a hour long program 45 minutes of air time
[24:27.680 --> 24:33.360]  saying war with china is imminent
[24:35.040 --> 24:39.440]  i mean you ought to see this i'll watch this this morning war with china are we closer
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  than we think then it goes on to say we're basically about to have war with china
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.080]  i mean ladies and gentlemen remember it's globalists that want to depopulate
[24:48.080 --> 24:52.240]  who are trying to start a war between china and the united states just like every other
[24:52.240 --> 24:55.840]  james bond movie you see which is based on real things that happened during the cold war
[24:55.840 --> 24:59.360]  by top mi6 former os s agent ian flaming
[25:02.320 --> 25:05.520]  and what is what is specter always trying to do trying to cause a big war
[25:06.080 --> 25:10.480]  and to have chaos and depopulate people they tell you in these movies what's really going on
[25:12.800 --> 25:16.960]  so it's getting crazy and i'm not defending ggping of the chai comms but they're saying
[25:16.960 --> 25:21.040]  we're having three children we're gonna arrest the homosexuals we're not running the american
[25:21.040 --> 25:27.600]  agenda to destroy the family the u.s is run by poison these are quotes we're against your
[25:27.600 --> 25:33.760]  new world order so they've broken with them and we're breaking with them and we had one side of
[25:33.760 --> 25:37.920]  trade deals so trump was trying to stop that and and i'm not saying arrest the homosexuals
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.720]  it's the left that loves ggping because you know he was supposed to defeat trump and defeat america
[25:42.720 --> 25:46.640]  what are they going to do now that their sugar daddy is not going along with them so
[25:46.640 --> 25:51.200]  it's like world war two we're different sides are joining other sides i mean we're really seeing
[25:51.200 --> 25:56.560]  historic dangerous stuff right now i'm going to cover it next segment i'm going to read the
[25:56.560 --> 26:00.560]  articles to you i'm going to read the documents to you in fact bringing the 900 pages is out
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.120]  there on the counter but i forgot i showed it a few weeks going there's just more documents just
[26:05.120 --> 26:12.560]  got released and yes i stand over 900 pages and it turns out fouchy wasn't running 10 programs or
[26:12.560 --> 26:17.920]  60 programs he was running hundreds of gain of function projects at labs all over china because
[26:17.920 --> 26:22.800]  it was illegal here in the u.s and i've got those articles i'm going to show you and then imagine
[26:22.800 --> 26:27.840]  being the football players the basketball players and imagine being those guys get hundreds of thousands
[26:27.840 --> 26:32.960]  of dollars to push the poison shots on people and football players and then to be people like the
[26:32.960 --> 26:40.240]  young turks and the majority report and folks like that who are out there pushing this agenda and we
[26:40.240 --> 26:46.480]  know that thousands of content creators on youtube leftists have been paid by big pharma and the
[26:46.480 --> 26:51.200]  federal government to tell you there's no side effects and it's safe and great imagine taking
[26:51.200 --> 26:58.400]  money to lie to people and to tell you that nobody resigned at the fda alex jones made that up that's
[26:58.400 --> 27:01.760]  what they say on the show i'm going to play you next hour they say oh that's just made up by alex
[27:01.760 --> 27:08.240]  jones of course it's not they hope you don't go look they're just reading a script they're given
[27:08.240 --> 27:20.000]  that they're paid to put out by their supporters by their sponsors see nobody pays me what to say
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  if somebody agrees with me they buy the products at info or store dot com it's funny once high
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.760]  quality products if somebody wants to be a sponsor they got a great product then they can be a
[27:27.760 --> 27:32.400]  sponsor we don't have many sponsors most people are scared to do it anything we sell is high quality
[27:32.400 --> 27:37.440]  whether it's the storeable food or whether it's the uh satellite phones or or whether it's our
[27:37.440 --> 27:43.920]  ionine or whether it's our d3 or whether it's our vitamin b12 all of that is what i use and my
[27:43.920 --> 27:49.680]  children use and my wife uses and my crew uses it's the very best we can find and get you even
[27:49.680 --> 27:53.680]  when supply chains are down we might have a product for six seven eight months or longer
[27:53.680 --> 27:57.200]  because we can't even get the highest quality ingredients anymore and then we have to just
[27:57.200 --> 28:04.640]  stop having the product that's quite pigheaded actually so i'm actually announced so sorry we
[28:04.640 --> 28:09.120]  don't have this formula anymore because you can't even get that wild crafted organic type you can
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.720]  only get this and i'll say this is still the best you can get now but we had to downgrade it
[28:12.720 --> 28:16.800]  because the supply chain's falling apart but i haven't had to do that yet but i believe in
[28:16.800 --> 28:21.440]  that mojo karma report you show what you get from me is how i want to be treated
[28:22.560 --> 28:28.240]  i believe what i do to you comes back on me and i know it does so i'm not screwing anybody over
[28:28.240 --> 28:32.640]  ever because of my soul because of who i am and believe me it isn't because i'm the greatest guy
[28:32.640 --> 28:37.600]  around that mean i don't think about doing bad things that mean i don't think about people i
[28:37.600 --> 28:44.800]  want to you know what but i don't do it because i know god's watching i'm god fearing infowarstore.com

[31:09.440 --> 31:14.320]  enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the population and america the entire

[33:40.960 --> 33:47.200]  they're spending about half the news time on fox cnn ms nbc not with the imploding border in tens
[33:47.200 --> 33:54.320]  of thousands more Haitians showing up not with biden not knowing what planet he's on not with the
[33:54.320 --> 33:59.200]  collapse of afghanistan or the really big story that's just a few news articles oh peter dadzikin
[33:59.840 --> 34:02.640]  pouchie told the pentagon and darpa they were developing
[34:04.000 --> 34:09.600]  nano viruses that were synthetic to purposely release covet nineteen in the wild
[34:11.680 --> 34:15.280]  oh that's not a big story that they lied about gana function and clearly released it
[34:15.280 --> 34:20.240]  to destabilize the world and then its operation lockstep in the un no no no no then releasing
[34:20.240 --> 34:26.400]  it to lock us down and have worldwide martial law and forced inoculations their whole globalist
[34:26.400 --> 34:32.640]  agenda here their whole un world government takeover their corporate fascism using communism and
[34:32.640 --> 34:38.400]  race war for control that's not important it's gabby potito and they're like well don't you care
[34:38.400 --> 34:42.400]  about gabby potito i don't know what about the tens of thousands of children they admit that have
[34:42.400 --> 34:46.960]  been kidnapped for child sex rings that are admitted in germany alone that's mainstream news
[34:46.960 --> 34:52.000]  with the government running or here in the u.s. oh well that's not gabby potito
[34:53.200 --> 34:57.280]  and yeah it's always a pretty young white woman missing here missing there and there's
[34:57.280 --> 35:01.600]  that's always happening millions of people come up missing you killed a year but you only hear
[35:01.600 --> 35:09.600]  about it when they want a big fat distraction and it's a who done it it's like the oj thing oh
[35:09.600 --> 35:15.200]  for like two years that's all we heard about was oj Simpson who really cut his life up
[35:15.200 --> 35:22.240]  and and again all the serious stuff got ignored while that went on and i'm not saying that it
[35:22.240 --> 35:27.200]  didn't matter what happened with oj Simpson's wife and ron goldman but why do we know ron goldman's
[35:27.200 --> 35:32.880]  name and not peter dazik's name and i'm going to read you all that now so understand if you want
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.800]  to stop them if you want to see justice because they're going to keep releasing new strains they're
[35:36.800 --> 35:41.520]  going to keep locking things down they're going to continue to to to to to fire you from your
[35:41.520 --> 35:46.720]  jobs so you take the deadly shots that actually make you produce the toxic nano spike protein in
[35:46.720 --> 35:51.200]  your body and then give it to others so they're spraying it on people that's now confirmed
[35:53.760 --> 35:57.680]  and they're having us produce it when they inject it in us that's all confirmed
[35:59.120 --> 36:04.160]  then they censor even members of the senate when they point out that natural immunity is better or
[36:04.160 --> 36:10.080]  that foutsies lying because big tech was invested at the wuhan land everybody wanted to get on this
[36:10.080 --> 36:16.320]  facebook and google and and and apple was involved in other labs because this is the big religion is
[36:16.320 --> 36:22.480]  depopulating us according to prince charles and prince phillip and ted turner and george soros
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.360]  and and bill gates and and oprah went free and all of them i was on timpool's show and i said type
[36:27.360 --> 36:32.240]  in billionaires meet in secret to stop over population and he saw the wall street journal
[36:32.240 --> 36:37.360]  and guardian them saying we want to get rid of 90 percent of the public and they're the ones running
[36:37.360 --> 36:46.640]  this program they did it they launched it foutsies 71st got in trump will face a deadly virus pandemic
[36:47.680 --> 36:54.560]  the first big global new pandemic is imminent we now know he'd already signed orders with the
[36:54.560 --> 37:02.080]  un for the takeover and i have those documents today i have those documents today before
[37:02.080 --> 37:08.320]  trump even got in january ninth 2017 weeks before fouchy made that speech i have the
[37:08.320 --> 37:13.200]  smoking guns because these bureaucrats all do it through their own bureaucracy so they're covered
[37:13.200 --> 37:18.400]  and say it was authorized well again uh the supreme court rule black people weren't human
[37:19.120 --> 37:25.280]  or two-thirds human we decided that wasn't true didn't we and i'm not calling for violence and i
[37:25.280 --> 37:29.200]  don't want violence but you're gonna get a john brown moment with these globalists that did all
[37:29.200 --> 37:33.280]  this and i don't want that because they'll turn them into victims but they are killing us they are
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.640]  assaulting us and so you mess with the bull you get the horns those that live by the sword die by
[37:38.640 --> 37:46.480]  the sword how about how about we are fousies legally arrested indicted and then how about we pass a
[37:46.480 --> 37:51.280]  law that he can be executed with his own spike spike protein and we'll put him in a big plexiglass
[37:51.280 --> 37:57.040]  cage in time square and then the federal government will administer a couple million of his own
[37:57.040 --> 38:02.240]  uh super viruses that were a thousand times stronger than he created for us and then he can he
[38:02.240 --> 38:06.720]  he can die a miserable death of suffocating from the stuff he created how about that how about
[38:06.720 --> 38:12.080]  after he's arrested indicted convicted he's executed not by the electric chair not by the
[38:12.080 --> 38:17.760]  firing squad not by lethal injection but by the super corona virus weapons he created how about
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.720]  that and how about we after bill gates is convicted how about he gets put in there too and by the way
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.360]  i know i make enemies of these men i don't care i'm not going to sit here and watch them kill
[38:27.360 --> 38:31.040]  everybody slowly with each new variant they release that are going to get stronger and
[38:31.040 --> 38:35.440]  stronger as they train us to stay in our houses and die i've got another idea
[38:38.080 --> 38:44.720]  but i'm not going to quote emperor palpatine to you i'll just say no no no so let's get into it
[38:44.720 --> 38:52.640]  right now wuhan scientist planned to release chimera covid spike proteins into bat populations
[38:52.640 --> 39:00.800]  using skin penetrating nanoparticles london telegraph zero hedge info wars dot com all
[39:00.800 --> 39:09.440]  confirmed from darpa that runs the pentagon and that's what i said a month ago to the pentagon
[39:09.440 --> 39:16.160]  and darpa and everybody i said if you don't release this then you're part of it and you
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.120]  really believe in this breakaway group that is going to try to carry out this depopulation plan
[39:21.120 --> 39:26.640]  i said i want to see the documents that you got on them i know it was being done under a pentagon
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.080]  plan and i know that that that under those parameters they believe they're authorized to do it if
[39:32.080 --> 39:36.880]  you the pentagon wasn't behind this because that's where all the news was moving you better come out
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.880]  now and they did so i'm going to ask everybody at the fbi and the cia and the pentagon you want
[39:42.880 --> 39:47.360]  your kids dead when faulty releases something worse are you going to stop him because he's behind it
[39:47.360 --> 39:51.280]  and shows bill gates he's going we're just going to sit here and let them kill us is that really
[39:51.280 --> 39:55.840]  what we're going to do are you really on board for this depopulation operation we'll see a lot of
[39:55.840 --> 39:59.600]  you lost family didn't you figured out you're not in on the club you didn't get the briefing you
[39:59.600 --> 40:05.040]  didn't get the real vaccine did you oh that's another thing they got real vaccines for this
[40:05.040 --> 40:10.720]  and i'd demand they'd be released and i'd demand the public have access to it oh i i believe in
[40:10.720 --> 40:14.960]  science i'm not against vaccines like the lying media says i'm against one that makes you create
[40:14.960 --> 40:20.720]  the spike protein and i guarantee all these leftists that got their $50,000 or whatever these talks show
[40:20.720 --> 40:25.040]  us to lie and say that all the science says the shots are good they're 100 effective there's no
[40:25.040 --> 40:29.360]  deaths happening all those lines i guarantee you they got family members dropping dead too because
[40:29.360 --> 40:35.040]  this is compartmentalized they're only giving a very small group of people the cure and believe
[40:35.040 --> 40:42.320]  me if they're releasing it they got it so let's let's let's get started here i mean folks i'm
[40:42.320 --> 40:45.440]  having i'm having trouble breathing i'm having an anxiety attack this never happens to me but like
[40:45.440 --> 40:49.600]  once a year when some story's so big or i get a call and some family members in a car recommend
[40:49.600 --> 40:55.440]  hurt you sure have that anxiety attack i mean this is total war i mean we we've got it he's
[40:55.440 --> 41:00.000]  got to be arrested they've all got to be arrested the whole house of cards has to come down this
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.400]  can't just continue on or we all have a responsibility to stop them and we have the total proof now
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.320]  i'm going to calm down i'm going to come back to this long segment it's the longest segment of
[41:10.320 --> 41:14.000]  the hour and i'm going to read all three of these articles i'm going to start i'm just going to read
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.520]  them on air and let you listen to it for yourself and then we'll have the background story to all
[41:17.520 --> 41:20.400]  of it and all the other stuff that goes with it because i've got that here for you in these stacks
[41:20.400 --> 41:25.840]  and it's even worse than i mean it's just crazy because again they're achilles heel is they always
[41:25.840 --> 41:32.000]  seek to do it under the cover of law or regulation so if it comes out they're protected but the
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.120]  pentagon and darpa did not take the bait and said no actually legal research don't do it
[41:37.120 --> 41:43.360]  but it endangers the human population that's the quote oh really you think creating a nanotech to
[41:43.360 --> 41:47.840]  get through the skin so it doesn't even have to get through the lungs little microscopic glass
[41:48.640 --> 41:53.440]  carrying the virus you think the same way gates has the patents on that you think
[41:54.800 --> 41:59.040]  spraying that into bats that then fly around with humans all over the place you think that might
[41:59.040 --> 42:05.840]  spread it you think put in the air might spread it when the chinese go in those caves and harvest
[42:05.840 --> 42:10.480]  the bats for their soup and that's just the cover they went and did that as a cover oh pentagon
[42:15.600 --> 42:21.840]  we want to release a bio weapon of course gates has partnered with darpa for new dna nanotech
[42:21.840 --> 42:27.520]  covet 19 vaccine what do you think this is so we come back i'll hit it we'll on scientists plan
[42:27.520 --> 42:32.480]  to release chimeric covid spike proteins in the bat population using skin penetrating nano
[42:32.480 --> 42:39.040]  particles darpa funded implantable biochip potentially be used to deploy moderna mRNA vaccine
[42:39.040 --> 42:45.280]  see what's going on telegraph who on scientists planned to release coronavirus covet 19 particles
[42:45.280 --> 42:50.000]  into cave bats leak papers real you look the virus up it's the exact same as covet 19 they just
[42:50.000 --> 42:59.280]  hadn't named the damn thing yet they hit you all with a bio weapon finally vitamin d3 and vitamin
[42:59.280 --> 43:03.920]  k that are both essential are getting the respect and the attention they deserve we've got a great
[43:03.920 --> 43:08.880]  product it's been out for six years winter sun long before the big crisis came along we were there
[43:08.880 --> 43:12.480]  saying this is high quality this will make you healthy this will be better for you and your
[43:12.480 --> 43:18.560]  family but what else doesn't get attention and needs to be looked at is vitamin b12 it is just as
[43:18.560 --> 43:23.920]  essential it is just as important and it is amazing and it's not just about your immune system it's
[43:23.920 --> 43:29.920]  about every part of your body it's it's really a hormone and it's what your building blocks of your
[43:29.920 --> 43:37.120]  entire body operate off of so these vitamins are essential vitamin d3 and of course vitamin b12
[43:37.120 --> 43:41.760]  go together like a horse and carriage do your own research we've got the highest grades you're
[43:41.760 --> 43:46.080]  going to find out there and they're taken under the tongue it's key to put it under the tongue for
[43:46.080 --> 43:51.920]  about a minute and let it sit so your blood vessels absorb it they're both available 50% off at
[43:51.920 --> 43:58.320]  info or store.com together or by themselves at 50% off at 25% off i've been fighting as hard as i
[43:58.320 --> 44:04.720]  can for almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop their agenda i wanted to wake up
[44:04.720 --> 44:10.400]  the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational but we failed
[44:10.400 --> 44:15.280]  yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flat-footed but they are going
[44:15.280 --> 44:21.280]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why it's more important
[44:21.280 --> 44:26.480]  than ever than all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people
[44:26.480 --> 44:30.880]  are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare the enemy and
[44:30.880 --> 44:35.040]  try to stop their agenda and we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one
[44:35.040 --> 44:39.040]  things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food ready to ship at very
[44:39.040 --> 44:44.560]  affordable prices at info or store.com so whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or

[44:58.080 --> 45:05.200]  we're already halfway through september 2021 it's just incredible and now the world is waking up
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.760]  that info wars was the tip of the spear and was dead on that's why it's more important than ever
[45:09.760 --> 45:13.920]  to keep us on air and i thank you all for your support your prayers and your word of mouth that

[45:56.560 --> 46:02.480]  products please take action you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very bittersweet everything
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.560]  we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility but
[46:06.560 --> 46:10.560]  i don't care about that i care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much
[46:10.560 --> 46:15.280]  credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and i don't have time to tell you
[46:15.280 --> 46:18.960]  all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going on
[46:18.960 --> 46:22.960]  but let's just say this we're going to see this through the end we're going to stay on air as
[46:22.960 --> 46:28.400]  long as we can so please pray for us and please buy the products and then infowarstore.com they're
[46:28.400 --> 46:33.120]  great products plus they fund the operation so you know unlike other products you can buy they're
[46:33.120 --> 46:38.080]  still great do they fund freedom no a lot of them don't these are great products that fund freedom
[46:38.080 --> 46:43.280]  and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth that's why the globalists
[46:43.280 --> 46:47.440]  are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air
[46:47.440 --> 46:51.600]  so while you're at it don't just financially support us and spread the word download everything
[46:51.600 --> 46:55.520]  we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[46:55.520 --> 47:14.400]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:25.520 --> 47:38.720]  all right ladies and gentlemen start your engines we are now into the final segment of the first
[47:38.720 --> 47:45.440]  hour and i'm going to prove all of it right now starting in the segment into the next hour
[47:45.440 --> 47:50.560]  with their own admissions their own documents that they premeditatedly created this weapon
[47:50.560 --> 47:56.320]  and they released this weapon and now they are releasing new variants upon the public through
[47:56.320 --> 48:01.280]  those that are injected and through systems they're spring on key populations they want to bring to
[48:01.280 --> 48:08.720]  their knees like the midwest and of course texas and florida and i was told that by a lot of people
[48:10.560 --> 48:17.840]  medical doctors us and former us intelligence heads and others and now here it is plus i could
[48:17.840 --> 48:22.400]  look at the evidence and see i was only hitting certain places and then petering out just like
[48:22.400 --> 48:30.160]  the first covet outbreaks of 1920 months ago so first overhead shot this is from the scientist
[48:30.800 --> 48:36.960]  2015 lab made coronaviruses trigger debate scientists said that they're splicing them
[48:36.960 --> 48:44.320]  together in chimeras so obama had them moved with peter dazik and of course fauci to china
[48:44.320 --> 48:49.680]  that's why it's so crazy when fauci gets up on tv and says no one ever did coronavirus research
[48:49.680 --> 48:55.920]  no one did gain a function he ran events called in favor of gain a function he wrote emails saying
[48:55.920 --> 49:03.280]  build me these five viruses together and release it he said make sure they can infect humans i mean
[49:03.280 --> 49:10.240]  that's in the damn emails we've shown them so continuing here are the new articles will on
[49:10.240 --> 49:16.880]  scientists plan to release chimeric covet spike proteins into bat populations using skin penetrating
[49:16.880 --> 49:21.120]  nano particles that zero hedge i'm going to get back to that in a moment that's in all the main
[49:21.120 --> 49:25.680]  line articles here's the one in telegraph i'm going to read it i'll give you the backstory
[49:26.400 --> 49:32.320]  wuhan scientists plan to release coronavirus particles into cave bats leaked papers reveal
[49:33.120 --> 49:38.800]  wuhan and us scientists were planning to release enhanced airborne coronavirus particles so it's
[49:38.800 --> 49:46.800]  not just an enhanced virus it's enhanced with particles to go through your skin unbelievable
[49:48.400 --> 49:54.880]  wuhan and us scientists were planning chinese communist chinese communist and us scientists
[49:54.880 --> 50:00.400]  were planning to release enhanced airborne coronavirus particles into chinese bat populations
[50:00.400 --> 50:06.240]  to inoculate them oh like they're doing us against diseases that could jump to humans
[50:06.240 --> 50:11.200]  then you read the grants it says they want it jumping into humans that's what the pentagon
[50:11.200 --> 50:16.240]  said no so they write to say to protect people we want to stop school shootings we want to go shoot
[50:16.240 --> 50:21.680]  up school they're like uh no new documents show that just 18 months before the first covet case
[50:21.680 --> 50:27.120]  appeared researchers had submitted plans to release skin penetrating nano particles
[50:27.120 --> 50:34.240]  hmm wonder what general flinn knows he says that's what's happening and aerosols containing quote
[50:34.240 --> 50:43.440]  novel chimeric spike proteins of bat coronaviruses into cave bats in unan china
[50:45.360 --> 50:51.840]  the reason i go back to flinn is flinn and others have quietly told medical doctors and others
[50:52.400 --> 50:55.280]  that said no we need to investigate the public he's talking about he said you need to get this out
[50:56.800 --> 51:01.600]  through those medical doctors that this is an aerosolized nanotech delivery system
[51:01.600 --> 51:05.440]  and then it's a synthetic virus i have other scientists on they agree with that and say it
[51:05.440 --> 51:09.280]  on their own and then we find all these patents by gates and others and then now the pentagon says
[51:09.280 --> 51:13.600]  they came to them through gates funded faulty controlled program and said actually do this
[51:15.120 --> 51:19.200]  i mean do you understand the magnitude of this that's why i called flinn this morning he has
[51:19.200 --> 51:22.400]  to call me back and i said you got to go public because i know they already you know went out
[51:22.400 --> 51:28.320]  where he wants tried to put him in prison falsely but with whistleblowers that know about this it's
[51:28.320 --> 51:31.920]  his right and duty to go public and tell everybody but it doesn't matter it's all out there now we
[51:31.920 --> 51:39.760]  have the documents they are says they also plan to create chimeric viruses genetically enhanced to
[51:39.760 --> 51:46.880]  infect humans more easily oh let me read that again they also plan to create chimeric viruses
[51:46.880 --> 51:52.800]  genetically enhanced can a function to infect humans more easily and a function and requested
[51:52.800 --> 51:58.720]  14 million from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa for the work that's the
[51:58.720 --> 52:04.800]  brain of the pentagon papers confirmed as genuine by former member of the trump administration
[52:04.800 --> 52:13.200]  wonder who that is show they were hoping to introduce human specific cleavage sites that's
[52:13.200 --> 52:18.880]  gain a function for humans to bat corona virus which would make it easier for the virus to enter
[52:18.880 --> 52:25.600]  human cells so they could put it in bats and say it came naturally from there and hide their
[52:25.600 --> 52:30.160]  little tracks so they were advertising a bio weapon and how to attack china and the pentagon
[52:30.160 --> 52:38.800]  said no thanks when cobit 19 was first genetically sequenced scientists were puzzled about how the
[52:38.800 --> 52:45.120]  virus had evolved such a human specific adaptation at the cleavage site of the spike protein which
[52:45.120 --> 52:49.840]  is the reason it is so infectious but the indians and others looked at it and said it has a p shuttle
[52:49.840 --> 52:54.960]  gene at several spots where it's clearly artificial it's been it's like frankenstein it's got literal
[52:55.680 --> 53:02.960]  cut points on it the documents were released by drastic the web-based investigations team who
[53:02.960 --> 53:09.120]  deserved the Nobel prize for literature and for journalism and 15 Pulitzer prizes but they won't
[53:09.120 --> 53:14.080]  the documents were released by drastic the web-based investigation team set up by scientists from
[53:14.080 --> 53:18.960]  across the world to look the origins of cobit 19 and it was DARPA that released it and didn't think
[53:18.960 --> 53:25.200]  it should be classified so that's why i say DARPA released it in a statement drastic said given that
[53:25.200 --> 53:32.400]  we find in this proposal a discussion of the plan introduction of human specific cleavage sites a
[53:32.400 --> 53:37.520]  review of the wider scientific community the plausibility of artificial insertion is warranted
[53:38.480 --> 53:42.560]  so they're just slowly plotting along a turtle saying oh it looks like it was made oh really
[53:42.560 --> 53:47.120]  they just call for making it fouching the document says combine these four viruses then add the spike
[53:47.120 --> 53:55.200]  protein from hiv which she helped build back in the 70s the proposal also included plans to mix
[53:55.200 --> 54:00.720]  high-risk natural coronavirus strains with more infectious but less dangerous varieties
[54:01.760 --> 54:07.680]  so it's spread easier the bid was submitted by british zoologist peter dadzig oh it works for
[54:07.680 --> 54:14.000]  fouching gates directly funded of eco science eco health alliance the us-based organization which
[54:14.000 --> 54:21.200]  has worked closely with the woolen institute of urology researching the coronavirus team members
[54:21.200 --> 54:28.160]  included dr she zen leave it's i'm saying it right the bat lady of wiv researcher dubbed that woman
[54:28.160 --> 54:32.560]  pictured below as well as u.s researchers from the university of north carolina and the united states
[54:32.560 --> 54:40.960]  geological survey national wildlife health center to get around uh fort detrick not wanting to do it
[54:40.960 --> 54:45.520]  which is why that article i showed you earlier out of north carolina is important here's obama
[54:45.520 --> 54:49.840]  the smoking gun that it was obama authorizing all this now seven years ago
[54:52.720 --> 54:58.480]  and of course he was creating things 10 000 times worse the article uh goes on i'm going to come back
[54:58.480 --> 55:04.080]  though and i'm going to get into wuhan scientists plan to release enhanced coronavirus into back
[55:04.080 --> 55:08.480]  caves for covid outbreak we've got the one in telegraph we've got more from the daily mail we've
[55:08.480 --> 55:15.360]  got more from other publications we're going to get to all of this for you they called it a souped
[55:15.360 --> 55:22.800]  up virus that can infect humans open air release they call that bio war they call that death penalty
[55:22.800 --> 55:29.600]  nobody should go kill bill gates uh or dazzic or any of these people that would turn them into
[55:29.600 --> 55:33.280]  victims in fact they'll probably stage a false flag on one of their facilities and say we caused it
[55:33.280 --> 55:37.360]  that's their next move oil release even bigger bio weapon to make us forget about all this but
[55:37.360 --> 55:42.160]  these are psychotics that are engaged in war they think they've corrupted so many politicians
[55:42.160 --> 55:46.000]  and got trump assigned on to this that he'll never double back in a minute happened they believe
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.400]  everybody's too self-serving and committed to the lie to ever stop them but they're going to release
[55:50.400 --> 55:55.200]  more stuff and always tighten the screws down for global martial law and force an oculation
[55:55.200 --> 55:58.640]  and they're going to release stuff so deadly in the future it'll kill billions of people that's
[55:58.640 --> 56:03.120]  their admitted plan this is all just a drill as gate said i told you that before he said it and
[56:03.120 --> 56:09.680]  so our only hope everybody is to get this out expose this and we need to take back our governors
[56:09.680 --> 56:13.760]  take back our grand juries take back congress and they've got to be prosecuted for me it's not
[56:13.760 --> 56:18.960]  vindictive bouts he's already a soulless creature bound for you know the center of a black hole
[56:18.960 --> 56:25.280]  he's already going with his own energy to his own place they have to be removed because they're
[56:25.280 --> 56:31.520]  assaulting us and attacking us and god doesn't like cowards we have a responsibility so pray for
[56:31.520 --> 56:35.760]  a global awakening and pray that you have the energy in the time to go crazy and i would go print
[56:35.760 --> 56:39.520]  off thousands of copies of these articles that hand them out around town i would i would send
[56:39.520 --> 56:44.160]  people the archive of this breakdown i've done i i would do your own announcement i don't care
[56:44.160 --> 56:48.480]  if you're 79 years old or 20 years old you should get on youtube start your own channel and talk
[56:48.480 --> 56:52.160]  about it i don't care if there's five viewers or a thousand you better talk about on your facebook
[56:52.160 --> 56:58.240]  you better get upset and do something or it's all over because believe me they wouldn't have
[56:58.240 --> 57:02.160]  committed to this unless they were going all the way which they told us oh it's wonderful it's
[57:02.160 --> 57:08.720]  cutting the carbon and there's too many people they did this with big corporate support u n support
[57:08.720 --> 57:13.840]  globalist support it's the globalist attacking america and attacking china i'd always said well
[57:13.840 --> 57:18.880]  looks like china might have done this because of the timing but china would get nuked for that no it's
[57:18.880 --> 57:22.960]  the globalist that's what they actually like they were for china and did set it up to make their
[57:22.960 --> 57:27.520]  companies that control china make more money but gg ping knows that now just kicking them all out
[57:27.520 --> 57:31.920]  and is announced he doesn't like trump being censored uh and that big tech's out of control so
[57:31.920 --> 57:36.240]  the globalists are losing control and they're so used to winning that unless they're exposed
[57:36.240 --> 57:41.280]  they're gonna launch new bigger bio attacks pretty soon so we're all in grave danger it's us or them
[57:41.280 --> 57:50.000]  we'll be right back hour number two stay with us i'll tell you what's life and death if you don't
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.720]  have freedom of speech if if you don't have the right to be able to communicate then you don't
[57:54.720 --> 57:59.760]  have a future always when governments take away speech they then enslave the population and then
[57:59.760 --> 58:04.400]  they finally start exterminating the population and america the entire world is going down the tubes

[1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:33.840]  that's why the vaccines are so effective this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated we've got to get
[1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:39.520]  them vaccinated and hopefully they will do it willingly i think we really need to make it clear

[1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:50.720]  okay if you just tuned in some stations only carry the second and third hour this is the
[1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:56.160]  biggest news we've ever reported and i've predicted as the quickening happens as the singularity
[1:06:56.160 --> 1:07:01.120]  approaches whatever you want to call it things are definitely speeding up getting more complex
[1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:05.440]  and more it's happening in a day that used to happen in a month that i'm sure i'll be here
[1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:10.160]  next week saying this is the biggest show ever because it's just getting that insane
[1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:15.520]  but on there 28 years i was probably on there 10 years before i said this is my biggest show ever
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:20.400]  then i probably would say it once every couple years but now i've been saying it almost every
[1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:25.200]  week because it just gets more out of control if we can the best way to do this just put the
[1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:30.160]  show headline back up from info wars dot com i'm going to read it to you and then i'm going to show
[1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:35.840]  you all the even mainstream news and the pentagon and darpa releasing when they got a four-year
[1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:42.960]  request they could have classified it the fact that fouchy and gates funded group peter does it
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:48.400]  came to them and said we want to move forward with gain of function chimera viruses to purposely
[1:07:48.400 --> 1:07:52.880]  in fact humans we want to release that on the general population so if you look at the show
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:56.800]  headline today for info wars dot com it says
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:06.800]  the biggest story of the 21st century darpa pentagon had blown whistle on secret plan
[1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:15.040]  to release covet 19 here it is here's the document obtained by the drastic research institute
[1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:29.520]  project defuse always called the opposite of what they do darpa pre mpt hr 001118
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:38.720]  s 0017 and here is the document now ladies and gentlemen i suggest you read it it's only 25 pages
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:46.240]  long because it says in here no fewer than 10 times we want gain of function we want to release
[1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:51.600]  nano tech to deliver it through the skin we want to purposely infect the open atmosphere with this
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:55.920]  show that it can infect humans it says specifically they want to be able to infect humans
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:05.040]  and the pentagon of course refused this this is from 2018
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:12.480]  and it shows how they're going to release and merge all these viruses together including one
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:19.440]  exactly the same as covet 19 and purposely infect animals in the general population
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:25.600]  and you have peter does it from that 2019 video saying oh we're merging five viruses but they
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:31.440]  told congress they weren't quote for a vaccine and now the vaccine makes you sick but the cover
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:38.080]  story that it's going to help you but it does the opposite and that's their cover here's page
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:46.480]  141 of the document they're sourcing and it says point 11 the proposal set a clear pathway for
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:53.760]  chimeric virus construction clear pathway and it goes into delivering it the synthesis of chimeric
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:10:02.080]  novel SARS-CoV-QS and then it's got all the different viruses named different numbers
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:09.760]  and then it goes on to talk about merging SARS and mirrors and all these other animals
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:19.200]  and diseases together and then it says point 12 EHA HSA 180 unpublished SARS-CoV strains oh more
[1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:26.800]  strains that they're telling us pop up this will be supplemented by characterization of isolated
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:38.880]  viruses under diffuse ATW IV approximately 15 to 20 bat SARS-CoV spike protein again a classified
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:49.600]  secret WIV and 180 bat SARS-CoV strains sequence to our prior work and not examined for spillover
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:56.080]  potential and it goes on all with the gain of function everything right here on the Pentagon
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:11:03.520]  saying no to it and developing it so that it would be able to go into humans here it is
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:12.080]  0.16 might be a little bit important for everybody the proposal includes the introduction of human
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:19.760]  specific cleavage into the sites human protein specific site insertion so they can you can get
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:27.760]  sick well it's proposed proposal does not specify exactly which but does discuss furrin in the
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:32.320]  preceding tweet and they going out they're going to merge it so they can get you sick with the
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:38.080]  COVID-19 and how they're going to get put it in bats and how it will then spread into all
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:44.960]  the other animals and humans for your safety of course they say because this might merge they
[1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:49.520]  made a camera requires whatever exists in nature so they said they were going to give weaker ones
[1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:54.720]  out so that we would get cured to it just like the vaccine cures us as it kills us so it's all
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:12:01.120]  cover story for how you produce a bio weapon and release it and then they had their spars event
[1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:07.760]  and they had their event 201 and they had their crimson contagion drills and did 201 during the
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:11.600]  actual release so if they got caught like oh i'm not talking on the phone or the email about how
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:16.880]  our weapon attacks happen that's just a drill that has the exact same tweets the exact same
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:24.160]  operations the exact same response and it's all there then you figure out wow they hit us no wonder
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:33.840]  when general flinn saw our spars 2023 2025 report that's really 2020 2022
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:40.240]  so it's supposed to be the future but it's it's set actually in our years he said no that's real
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:46.880]  that's a bio weapon attack plan these guys cooked up well it's because he was the head of the army
[1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:53.840]  intelligence defense intelligence agency at the time and of course they knew that stuff was going on
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:13:00.880]  and uh here it is and it's exactly what flinn said it is a nano particulate and now they just
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:04.960]  go with a pure nano particulate that actually can replicate the synthetic that is just the spike
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:08.880]  protein so you don't ever find a virus you just find the spike protein that's what they test for
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:13.280]  and it doesn't matter how many times you you you get antibodies or what you do
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:17.040]  it'll just keep coming back because they got thousands of them they're going to keep spraying
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:23.200]  them on you and they got lots of eco terrorists in their ranks uh dazik and all of them go to the
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:28.960]  big depopulation events and say we should depopulate the world and mark zuckerberg gave hundreds of
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:34.640]  millions of the project and so did google sundar pachai oh they're not just building the chinese
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:40.320]  ai they're over there in that no man's land so they could attack everybody in the world bringing
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:44.240]  global government and then china won't want to say it's them and ever tattle because they were
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:48.240]  involved the u.s government won't want to tattle because they were involved except they got out of
[1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:53.840]  it our scientists 2015 said stop it so obama moved it there and then they tried to come to the pentagon
[1:13:53.840 --> 1:14:00.720]  with a proposal to set them up man you can they want to get everybody compromised so you'll do
[1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:07.280]  what the project manager falci his main underling was peter dazik and that's what falci's in charge
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:12.720]  because they're the one blackmailing the cia and the pentagon and the defense intelligence agency
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:20.480]  everybody else oh you're such a smart british intelligence officer dazik oh we're so scared
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:25.600]  of you you really tricked us but then when he knew stuff was coming out he gave interviews
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:30.960]  admitting a lot of it so when it comes out he goes oh i wasn't hiding this oh no i'm the i'm
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:36.800]  the eco alliance i i just want to save the earth by helping with population but i just
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:43.200]  would be obsessed with bio weapons no big deal see if you're gonna release a bio weapon you need
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:47.280]  to do it against who's rebelling the western world has the history of saying no to the new
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:53.280]  world order no to communism no to corporate fascism so you hit canada the uk the united states
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:58.240]  western europe australia new zealand but australia new zealand said hey we don't need to be hit
[1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:03.520]  leave us as a zone that doesn't have this we'll just totally crack down and be a laboratory for
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:11.120]  control and that's what they did and now we know exactly what they did and you've got pieces of this
[1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:17.440]  the last 19 20 months here it's gosh it's 21 months 22 months now sorry time just flies i've
[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:26.960]  been supposed to this it's late january that's 20 21 months and so here we are and it's all happened
[1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:30.400]  our original instincts were right doing the background knowing that other stuff they were the
[1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:35.680]  experts we had on knowing this was previously happening and so you better ask yourself now
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:38.880]  what are they going to do as this comes out they're going to release a more deadly bio weapon
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:44.240]  probably four false flies themselves were both so prepare to die everyone prepare to die they're
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:47.840]  going to murder all of us we're just going to sit here and take it i know we are or we see the
[1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:52.720]  military starting to move that's good it's up to us whether we want to stop them or not or we're all
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:56.720]  dead this is their move they got strains a hundred times worse you heard them
[1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:05.600]  your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet or in person it changes
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:10.960]  the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular they know you're angry and now to get
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:16.320]  around big tech it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got well ladies and

[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:11.360]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that immune system health can literally be the
[1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:16.560]  difference between life and death you probably already believe that i certainly do so here's the
[1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:21.920]  thing i wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have

[1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:08.560]  that trump tried to overthrow the u.s government two days ago on january six and i just want you
[1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:12.400]  to know i've taken control of the nuclear weapons and if trump tries to launch an attack on you
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:18.480]  we'll let you know first the attack's coming that is from the transcript then he called up
[1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:24.240]  polosi schumer and others to say i'm loyal to you i'm going to protect trump from using nuclear
[1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:28.160]  weapons when trump was going for detente with china and north korea at the time and trumps
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:32.960]  responded saying it's a total lie polosi's come out admitted it happened helsey bragg back on
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:38.720]  january 8th that it took place then and is saying that she honors milley and that he's this courageous
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:43.760]  person so we're all these other democrats so this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in
[1:19:43.760 --> 1:19:48.640]  control for a long time now coming out of the shadows publicly remember these people literally
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:54.720]  hate you and your family now they're injecting you with poison soft kill injections wake up america
[1:19:54.720 --> 1:20:15.040]  rb destroyed you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:15.040 --> 1:20:22.320]  my eyes are blind but i can see my friends
[1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:36.320]  my eyes are blind but i can see the snowflake is on the tree
[1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:56.320]  the sun no longer sets me free i feel the snowflakes
[1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:05.040]  all right i want to explain this again i could talk about the woman found dead in the national
[1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:11.280]  park all day sad for her or i can talk about the globalist preparing a global lockdown for future
[1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:17.680]  more deadly bio releases for depopulation now this is all a drill to train us to be serve all slaves
[1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:20.080]  while we're quietly killed and world government's brought in
[1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:31.600]  so now i'm not going to talk about gabby patino and i'm not going to talk about the nfl
[1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:36.400]  and who won this weekend and i'm not going to talk about a lot of these other distractions
[1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:40.240]  and quite frankly the border collapsing is bad and of course they're raping a bunch of kids but
[1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:44.000]  the media doesn't care about that they care about more patrol doing their job trying to arrest people
[1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:50.880]  and the left's attacking their own agency right now because they are enemies of this country
[1:21:50.880 --> 1:21:55.840]  i've got all that right here i've got all these amazing clips and all these interesting things but
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:22:04.400]  at the end of the day what really matters here is that we're going under agenda 21 and as biden said
[1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:10.960]  yesterday at the un this is the transformational decade to bring us in to globalism to the new
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:14.720]  world order and at the end of this decade they're going to be a lot less people and you're going
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:21.600]  to be under a medical tyranny you see how fast it's moving now now what they're doing is very
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:25.680]  unpopular very criminal but they got all the big banks and all the big money and they've got most
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:29.920]  the bureaucrats behind them and most the countries but what they're doing again is unpopular and
[1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:34.960]  murderous and if people simply find out the vaccine doesn't protect you it's not a vaccine
[1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:38.720]  the more you take it now they say even if you have the shot you've got to be locked down
[1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:46.160]  people are waking up that it's a trap 15 days to slow the spread to cut the curve now you know it's
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:52.160]  15 trillion years it doesn't end it's an end of our free society by the big corporations and police
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:58.880]  from spain to australia from new york city of london beating up women with their children with
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:02.800]  them and even beating up little children even splitting people's heads because they dared
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:09.440]  try to come outside and not wear a mask absolute tyranny that's happened over and over again
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:15.840]  happening again and then the very scientists that ran the lab that released the virus and
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:20.960]  cooked it up and is on record wanting to release it and get the pentagon's approval who said no
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:26.240]  so they did anyways is in charge of our global health and tells the you and what to do and tells
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:31.040]  us to do because he's funded by bill gates and the psychotic group of people that control the
[1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:36.720]  ford rockefeller carnegie and ibm foundations you know them as the bill and the gates foundation
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:42.560]  i got news on bill gates that segment ahead of a very special doctor who's really good at
[1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:47.760]  connecting the dots he's a trauma doctor an emergency room doctor many years in studio with
[1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:56.080]  us coming up next hour but let me just show you from the darpa document from dr peter dazik and
[1:23:56.080 --> 1:24:04.400]  anthony foushee's organization let me show you what it says right here proposal volume one
[1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:09.680]  and this is actual document this isn't just the london telegraph with wuhan scientists plan to
[1:24:09.680 --> 1:24:16.160]  release coronavirus particles into bat caves covered in nanotech spike systems that burrow
[1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:21.280]  through your skin and get into your body or wuhan scientists plan to release enhanced coronaviruses
[1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:25.840]  in bat caves you know the daily mail or any of that or info wars dot com i'm gonna show you the
[1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:34.160]  document here this is what the pentagon released this is supposed to be restricted this is bio weapon
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:39.680]  research and bio weapon defense research what they hide it under you get into here and this is what's
[1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:45.200]  all the newspapers you can read it for yourself gain a function merging so it hits humans adding
[1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:51.760]  the hiv delivery system to it what the indian government said in january of last year 21 months
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:58.560]  ago everything the indian said they were the first they scanned it with their crisper system and
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:02.080]  said it's man made a hundred percent then they threatened to pull all their country's funding
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:07.920]  the imf world bank did so they withdrew the study but it turns out it's all true ladies and gentlemen
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:17.120]  look at 11 the proposal set a clear pathway for chimeric virus construction and that list
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:22.160]  the SARS COVID virus is being merged together with the spike protein part 11 this will be
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:27.200]  supplemented by characterization of isolated viruses it goes through the agreements with the
[1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:34.160]  SARS COVID family with the hiv delivery system part 16 proposal includes the introduction of human
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:40.400]  specific cleavage sites for delivery into humans that's the spike protein now let's get further
[1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:47.840]  oh let's look at page 1625
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:57.520]  or page 16 slash 25 then it links to these articles from other pages 18 to propose planned
[1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:04.960]  to research alternative receptors and when you look up the new receptor they're going to add to
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:13.280]  the new virus they've made that's four viruses it's dc sign to elevate this the spike protein
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:19.200]  that's again a function elevate to gain a function this to elevate this we will sequentially introduce
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:29.520]  clad to disrupting residues of SARS-CoV and shco 14 and evaluate virus growth in vitro cells
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:38.720]  non perm permissive cells ecto typically expressing dc sign and in human
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:43.840]  anticipated reduced virus growth efficiency
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:53.280]  and it goes on to say they're adding dc sign now what's that mean i looked up what dc sign is
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:59.760]  from our good little buddies over at wikipedia and it's on the NIH website in fact i guess this is
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:05.920]  from the NIH website this is from wikipedia this one right here let's look what dc sign is they're
[1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:13.840]  adding this but they already tell you oh roll in hiv of dc sign this molecule it's what the spikes
[1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:24.400]  made up of is involved in initial stages of human immunodeficiency virus infection as hiv gp 120
[1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:33.120]  molecule causes co internationalization or internalization of the dc sign molecule and hiv virus
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:39.680]  particle and it goes on from there the derelict cell that migrates to the cognitive lymph node organ
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:47.360]  whereupon recycling of the dc sign hiv viron complex to the cell
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:57.040]  facilitates hiv infection of dc4 t cells by insertion between dc sign and ic am3
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:02.880]  that's that's pretty friendly isn't it that's why the australians first said we'll do a whole virus
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:08.640]  vaccine that's the safest but then people were testing positive for hiv because it's the shell
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:13.520]  of the hiv virus people won't believe that just type into the search engine it'll be in
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:21.680]  web now it's old from last year type in australia pulls vaccine after false positive hiv
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:26.880]  dc kind of like all the false positive cancer they say oh don't worry you got lymph node cancer
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:31.040]  or cervical cancer uterine cancer or just stickular that'll probably go away and it
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:38.160]  doesn't then kills you don't worry it says you got hiv enjoy enjoy the enjoy oh what happened
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:43.920]  to roger stone's wife she got lymphoma cancer after the Pfizer shot a month after there it is bbc
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:48.960]  australia vaccine abandon over false hiv responses so there you go enjoy your vaccine by the way it
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:54.080]  creates this in your body enjoy yourself you're all the superstars that took the shot you're smarter
[1:28:54.080 --> 1:29:02.160]  than us so many people say to me alex please stop being so negative well for me admitting i've gotten
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:08.880]  a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative it hurts it stinks it's got pus coming
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:14.160]  out of it i go to the doctor they fix it that's not negative i'm not living in denial and so think
[1:29:14.160 --> 1:29:19.680]  of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet but now it's come to the surface
[1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:25.280]  that's actually a positive thing and so yeah trump did an overall great job they stole the election
[1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:32.480]  we can't get down about that we have forced them out in the open so now they're trying to suppress
[1:29:32.480 --> 1:29:36.960]  us because they know they've been exposed they're scared that's why instead of saying oh we're
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:41.120]  a bunch of losers look what happened no we're a bunch of winners they're trying to suppress us
[1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:46.880]  let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening your own website your own show
[1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:52.080]  my show other articles other videos just keep sharing however you can and realize we're an
[1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:58.400]  information war we're going to win this together in the fight starts at info wars dot com globalist
[1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:04.960]  general milley has revealed to the world that the united states is not a free republic but is run
[1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:11.120]  by a permanent state by network bureaucracy the big takeaway here is is that he didn't act alone
[1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:17.440]  he felt that he was safe to talk on an overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched
[1:30:17.440 --> 1:30:22.160]  but not just our government the five eyes the russians and the chinese he wanted the world to
[1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:27.280]  know that he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state this permanent
[1:30:27.280 --> 1:30:32.640]  bureaucracy sees america as its enemy it sees the american people as its enemy it sees prosperity
[1:30:32.640 --> 1:30:38.160]  as its enemy and it conspired with the communist chinese to threaten them basically and say
[1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:44.240]  trump may nuke you but if he tries we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first
[1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:49.200]  that's beyond treason but it shows the type of anti-american sycophants living in their own
[1:30:49.200 --> 1:30:54.400]  fetid bubble they try to get away with this milley and all of his accomplices need to go to prison
[1:30:54.400 --> 1:31:01.280]  now for life frank in north carolina thanks for holding so long go ahead yeah i just have to

[1:32:02.880 --> 1:32:08.560]  communicate then you don't have a future always when governments take away speech they then enslave
[1:32:08.560 --> 1:32:13.360]  the population and then they finally start exterminating the population and america the entire world
[1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:18.400]  is going down the tubes because the un global's directed great reset that's why it's more important

[1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:02.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:16.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny will so
[1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:22.080]  does he lie from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[1:33:25.520 --> 1:33:32.160]  so the headlines up on info wars.com that the pentagon slash DARPA has blown the whistle
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:35.920]  on a fouchy bill gates proposal to purposely release
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:43.040]  COVID-19 on the population of china biggest story of the 21st century DARPA pentagon had
[1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:49.120]  blown whistle on secret plan to release COVID-19 and it goes on fouchy's right-hand man peter
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:56.240]  dazik sought DARPA's approval to release a deadly COVID virus into the wild and it goes on from
[1:33:56.240 --> 1:34:00.640]  there and look how they get to be the saviors they were in control of the un they were in control
[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:04.480]  of almost all the major government's health departments they could pose as the saver they
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:10.480]  could propose lockdowns forced inoculations everything you see today and then make trillions
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:17.360]  of dollars and depopulate us while they're at it this this is 21st century war and they made
[1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:21.920]  their move not with tanks not with guns but with the virus they released create fear and other
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:27.360]  vaccine that actually makes your body create the very spiked nano protein and that's what it is it
[1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:34.000]  is nano and they proposed a nano tech delivery system of the artificially created gene splice
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:42.080]  systems so this is it and it's the hiv delivery system i just showed you that last segment
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:49.840]  and remember the big news fouchy here's the headline fouchy funded wuhan lab viruses i'm
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:55.840]  sorry i said a hundred times your mind dials things down if anything i i dial things down i don't
[1:34:55.840 --> 1:35:03.200]  exaggerate fouchy funded wuhan virus 10 000 times stronger than usual that was even in the london
[1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:08.960]  guardian but they said it's for our safety but he lied to congress none of these viruses from
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:14.560]  four different animals would ever merge but they created them they weaponized them they made them
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:19.920]  deliverable to humans and they released them and remember what's in their own document they've got
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:27.360]  a thousands of other variants including ones that are 10 000 times stronger all in this document
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:32.080]  guys i'm gonna link this document under the live show feed just say see the smoking
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:37.840]  un document for yourself and add it to the live show feed right under the video player please add
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:44.640]  this thank you i'm asking all the listeners everybody look the border collapsing is nothing
[1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:49.520]  compared to this and it's super important it's like having a a toe cutoff this is like someone
[1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:55.520]  dropping a nuclear bomb on compared to your toe being cut off i mean this is the end of the world
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:36:00.800]  stuff where they roll it out gate says oh much worse stuff's coming if you stayed locked down if
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:07.120]  you agree that didn't give you the vaccine injections but lower your immunity bare minimum
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:11.520]  so they release a more deadly weapon later you have no defense and they use the people that
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:16.880]  they've hit as factories to release the the mutation that they've already studied in animals
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:21.360]  and in prisoners in china and they know what's going to happen i mean this has all been frozen
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:26.000]  in liquid nitrogen and then released on us and again they also have nano tech that's able to
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  deliver it as well that's in the document and what did general flinn say what did that one of our
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.720]  experts always medical doctors they said what's hit texas in florida doesn't even show up as
[1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:42.000]  coveted most people tested it is nothing but a special protein that replicates a crystal
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:46.960]  and now the pentagon wants to put chips in everybody that is the globals that control it
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:50.880]  to quote measure for coveted and they say it's never going away it's your new way of life
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:55.360]  biden said new deadly variants will be coming will be hitting us this is just the beginning
[1:36:55.360 --> 1:37:02.000]  oh it's just the beginning 15 days to stop the curve two months just to wear a mask
[1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:08.640]  three months locked down here we are 19 months 20 months later and they're just getting started
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:11.360]  bill gates warns that the next pandemic can be 10 times worse
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:17.440]  well he's got viruses 10 000 times worse he created so i mean he's got that in his pocket
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:22.480]  the guy that wants to depopulate you the guy with the history of all this the guy that funds it
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.080]  and runs it all has all the robber burns behind him the guy that goes to quote secret meetings
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:30.880]  with other billionaires to discuss how to depopulate us with prince charles at the meetings
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:35.520]  talking about deadly viruses to depopulate us that's in the wall street journal what did they
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:40.640]  discuss well deadly viruses to contribute to getting rid of people go read it
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:46.800]  ten pools a really smart guy but he didn't believe me till he pulled up all the articles
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:52.000]  from 2009 when they tried to coming out though they're like maybe we should get rid of certain
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:57.600]  groups of people you know they're poor maybe race specific weapons are the answer dick cheney wrote
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:05.280]  that in april of 2000 april second 2000 rebuilding america's defenses peanut document they left it
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:11.280]  up on their site for 15 years took it down a few years ago he still find it online rebuilding
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:18.560]  america's defenses peanut says let's use race specific bio weapons you think i just made all this up
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:24.880]  by the way you people say oh that guy's a rock climber he's got a lot of courage or
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:28.960]  that guy you know is in the military fighting they got courage and they do
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  do you understand that i'm putting my life in my hands telling you this
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:40.240]  they're really pissed at me i'm not stupid and i'm pushing it i told my family they're probably
[1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:44.720]  gonna ban me off the internet soon a month before it happened because i could tell i was pushing them
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:48.400]  and i told my family i don't know how long i'll be here i won't commit suicide but they
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:52.400]  that they can't stand what's happening for me to be able to continue on you've got to wake up and
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:56.400]  warn others but here's the reason i'm willing to die here's the reason i don't have no fear
[1:38:57.200 --> 1:39:02.400]  and you know i don't walk up to the mailbox at 2 a.m and look around my you look around for somebody
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:06.560]  coming up to shoot me in the back of the head i'm not worried about it they're going to kill everybody
[1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:11.360]  and maybe the third or fourth next wave that's their plan to lock everything down incrementally
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:16.560]  i didn't just say this once this happened i said it 20 years ago 15 years ago it's in films i made
[1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:20.800]  how they're going to release incrementally more deadly viruses to make sure they maintain control
[1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:25.360]  while they kill you that's how they operate i've learned how they and it's in their documents now
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:30.320]  so i don't want to sit here and watch my kids die i don't want to watch all my neighbors die i don't
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:35.440]  want to see the robot vans pulling up and loading up all the dead bodies in five ten years i don't
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:39.920]  want to like run off the middle nowhere and hide in some little town and wait for it to come and
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:43.840]  then you know and they're just going to fly over the drone and spray me with a synthetic virus
[1:39:43.840 --> 1:39:49.840]  i mean that we got one shot to stop them and they're probably going to release a bio weapon anyways
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:53.360]  but then at least we'll know they did it and we're going to be able to beat them i'm not going to
[1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:58.320]  sit here and buy my time and watch them kill everybody so i'm not worried you understand
[1:39:58.320 --> 1:40:04.640]  we're dead already i'm dead already unless we stop this it's the cheesy star trek rathakon
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:09.600]  analogy a spock in the reactor and they go you know let's save him he goes he's dead already
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:16.720]  i'm dead already you're dead you're you and your family are dead you and your family are dead
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:23.040]  you're dead unless you stop them so i have no fear except just letting them kill everybody
[1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:26.960]  i care about my children a lot more than myself and i care about all of us more than them
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:31.040]  because they've tried that too threatened my children everything else you know what
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:37.440]  i'm all in baby 100 that's where i'm supposed to be and so this is not done out of courage people
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:43.440]  bless it's done out of survival the only move we've got is as adults to go into that reactor
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:48.000]  because the whole ship's going to get blown up anyways and maybe we live that's that's all
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:53.680]  that's all icing on the cake but it doesn't matter we've got to get in there and turn this
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:58.560]  around or everybody's gone and maybe you just go well there's too many of us anyways and maybe
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:03.600]  he's not right you know i'm right it's okay you join satan then we're just going to play golf for
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:07.760]  another five ten years until you you know you maybe kiss a system's ass and you're going to
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:12.960]  stock home syndrome to it maybe go along with it so it leaves you alone until last that's not going
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:18.800]  to work maybe a thousand people are getting a ticket out of this why they're all building big
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.520]  bunkers why the ones that aren't part of it are all dug in most of the elites are already moved
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:27.760]  in private islands with 50 foot walls and they don't even trust their security and they should
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:31.120]  because their security is going to take them out i can assure you when their families die back here
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:37.040]  or the security is going to end up running those compounds and so that's why they're going into
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:43.120]  robot guns and everything they've got robots robot guns super more advanced than you even know about
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:48.480]  at their facilities by themselves or their families that's the prison they've built in
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:55.040]  new zealand and australia and kawaii and that's why new zealand's are advertising and so is australia
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:42:01.040]  we're a police state we're totally locked down you'll be safe here you think you're going to be safe
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:04.720]  with your new zealand security people and your bunkers no you're not going to be safe unless
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:08.080]  you're alone and that's why the more advanced systems and i know people that have helped put
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:14.480]  them in have robots like literally like the entrances or else like a door pops open and
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:20.800]  there's like remote control robots ai gun ports uh tear gas systems everything else but that's not
[1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:25.040]  not going to stop people on a suicide mission from coming and dumping gasoline down your
[1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:30.160]  breathing snorkels and i'm not going to do that i'm just telling you man it's on into the world
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:35.840]  folks this is it unless we stop them into the world unless we stop them this is it they've
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:42.000]  made their move the design control collapse of planet earth is here so that's it a lot of
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:46.720]  the news will hit when we come back but the total smoking gun of the creating covet nineteen and
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:50.400]  trying to get the pentagon to sign on to releasing it is and obviously that was the blackmail the
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:53.760]  pentagon just like jeffrey ebsdie was blackmailing folks it's all about blackmail
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:04.640]  in uh uh 59 years old in good health i'm not working in the front line so my
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:12.400]  time is not recommended to get back to nation that was the current ceo of phyzer just a few
[1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:20.400]  months ago on a national tv interview saying oh he doesn't need to take the so-called m r and a
[1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:25.520]  vaccine that's really a gene therapy he said you know he's 57 years old he's healthy he doesn't
[1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:31.360]  need it it's at risk people but that's not what is b r firms that have bought off the politicians
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:35.600]  of over a hundred countries say they say you've got to take it to have a job or leave your house or
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:41.760]  get on a plane or a train or even get outside your home for one hour a day if you live in australia
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:47.200]  so remember the white house is exempt congress and their staff are exempt the postal service is
[1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:51.840]  exempt all these big corporate heads are exempt they're not taking their poison vaccine they're
[1:43:51.840 --> 1:44:00.240]  pushing it on you wake up folks wake up when bob woodward's new book came out alleging that
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:04.160]  general milley had called the head of the chinese military and said trump might nuke you
[1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:08.480]  he tried to overthrow the u.s government but basically i'm protecting you and i'll warn you
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:13.200]  if we launch an attack which was the greatest reason us history that has ever been committed
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:17.920]  people said oh alex it must not be true and i might wait bob woodward's former naval intelligence
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:22.480]  he's a big insider globalist he wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted to put it out
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:27.440]  to say that milley was a hero to set the precedent you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind
[1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:31.920]  network deep state basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over america that's what he put
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:36.480]  bite in he's so incredibly weak he's to undermine the idea of the presidency well people said i was
[1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:41.280]  making it up with bob woodward's line well now milley admits he did it you see i didn't need to
[1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:46.480]  trust bob woodward i remember polosi on january eight ragging that she got the call for milley
[1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:50.320]  that he'd take you control the news so this treason was hiding in plain view back then
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:54.880]  and we covered it see i have a memory folks i remember all this stuff that's why i know it's true
[1:44:54.880 --> 1:45:02.560]  and what's false humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet but the big corporations for 100
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:06.640]  years have told us that humans are bad and evil and a pest wants on the earth so that we begin to
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:11.600]  believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics base globalists
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:16.880]  take control of the planet do you know the claus schwaab of the evils group's own wikipedia page
[1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:22.720]  he brags on there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:28.880]  to set up a corporate dictatorship under the un they admit all of this they plan the lockdowns
[1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:35.040]  they release the viruses they think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources
[1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:40.480]  so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives that's how i was able to predict
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:47.520]  everything they did decades before they executed it word for word with total precision because they

[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:48.560]  every one of you that's been hit by covet 19 the so-called delta variant was hit by a corporate
[1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:57.680]  united nations third rail bio weapon synthetic system you are a veteran of a biological war
[1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:05.280]  but you're not a victim you're an overcomer and everybody that died was a casualty of that war
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:12.320]  and one way or another we are going to build monuments one day to those murdered by bill
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:17.360]  gates and fouchy and the united nations and claus schwaab and one way or another whether
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:23.200]  it's going to be a billion or five billion people that have to die first they will be
[1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:29.920]  brought to justice you can bet your soul on that and they don't even care because they want to
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:33.600]  murder people for their god and they're made their move they told you they wanted to depopulate you
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:40.160]  and they've done it but you're only got your toe in the water right now you're only easing into that
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:45.280]  destructive system it's time to wake up and admit the horror they think you're an idiot
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:54.640]  they think you're weak you know we don't just have event 201 and crimson contagion and the spars of
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:49:05.120]  drill and operation lockstep we also have this from federal register dot gov thought he was
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:11.280]  already in place then he'd been there since the 70s so when he came out just a few weeks after
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:18.640]  this and said trump will be faced with the new deadly pandemic well michael more said something
[1:49:18.640 --> 1:49:22.320]  big's coming something international you'll see trouble be challenged they were all sitting around
[1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:26.480]  laughing that's why google and all of them contribute all that money in facebook to the
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:29.520]  will on lab they're all part of the fun they want to be part of the 12 monkey scenario
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:39.680]  control of communicable diseases january 19th 2017 one day before trump got sworn in
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:46.960]  they put the marshal law plan in here to have the cdc under the united nations and basically
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:54.080]  have marshal law and lock everything down the exact way they did the division of global migration
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:59.680]  and quarantine and all the big plans and all the preparations that he was talking about they put
[1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:04.640]  that in right before trump 24 hours before he came in as their little plan and then it was
[1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:10.880]  faulty a few weeks later very excited to a group of his cohorts like the joker there meeting with
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:15.920]  his other criminal gang members and some some feted basement bragging about their plan for us
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:23.360]  here it is and if there's one message that i want to leave with you today based on my experience
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:29.680]  and you'll see that in a moment is that there is no question that there will be a challenge the
[1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:35.360]  coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases both chronic infectious diseases in
[1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:40.960]  the sense of already ongoing disease and we have certainly a large burden of that but also there
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:46.800]  will be a surprise outbreak and i hope by the end of my relatively short presentation you will
[1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:53.040]  understand why history and the history of the last 32 years that i've been the director of
[1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:59.600]  niaid will tell the next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be
[1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:08.080]  faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with all right let's go ahead and
[1:51:08.080 --> 1:51:14.160]  hear Fauci talking about his primary target is the young people to introduce into them
[1:51:14.160 --> 1:51:18.320]  basically cancer causing viruses that cause blood clots for life that'll bring down the
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:22.160]  united states because he knows we'll put more money into a child they'll probably get 10 times
[1:51:22.160 --> 1:51:26.560]  the money out of infecting a baby or a teenager or a five-year-old and they will just killing an
[1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:31.200]  old person they want to keep from getting your pension fund the primary target is the children
[1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:36.480]  here is the mass murdering criminal that launched hiv covered up the cures for it the treatments
[1:51:36.480 --> 1:51:41.440]  uh he was he was attacked then for it here is the true jesus mingla the nazi mingla was nothing
[1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:47.120]  compared to him here is the sickle it's what his name means here is the grim reaper the grim reaper
[1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:53.440]  garden gnome himself saying primary target your children here it is can you we keep hearing from
[1:51:53.440 --> 1:51:57.200]  officials in the administration yourself and others that that you're confident about a vaccine
[1:51:57.200 --> 1:52:02.240]  for kids kids ages five to eleven this fall can you say with some level of confidence that you
[1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:10.400]  think there will be that vaccine available before halloween you're trying to get me in trouble by
[1:52:10.400 --> 1:52:19.120]  pinning that day confidence before halloween so nice you know i think halloween's what i told
[1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:23.920]  it thirty first is that what it is yeah i think there's a really good chance it will be before
[1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:31.520]  halloween yeah okay and you're pretty confident so happy i i it depends on what you mean by
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:37.120]  pretty confident i i believe there's a reasonably good chance that it will all right primary target
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:41.600]  your children even though they have basically zero percent dying but they will now with the
[1:52:41.600 --> 1:52:45.280]  new strains he's going to release don't worry no one will go away more people die now than last
[1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:50.880]  year way more but we took the shots and all the graphs around the world i want to play a paul
[1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:54.560]  joseph watson report that's short and sweet but it really shows you how sick bill gates says that
[1:52:54.560 --> 1:52:59.680]  how much trouble he's in with jeffrey epstein the rest of it at the moment but first if we all
[1:52:59.680 --> 1:53:04.880]  stand up now if we expose this they're gonna back off or they're gonna release the new bio weapon
[1:53:04.880 --> 1:53:08.400]  but at least more people will know what hit them we'll have a chance then people will really wake up
[1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:11.360]  you know once a third of the population dies or whatever and then we'll actually get them
[1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:15.360]  because so many people in the power structure that are left will actually realize this has happened
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:20.160]  there's very few people are involved in this and that's why uh they're gonna be successful if we
[1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:24.800]  don't wake people up so it's the strength and weakness of their operation so tell everybody you
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:30.400]  know to tune in the broadcast right now i'm a very special whistleblower video that's exactly

[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:47.600]  information uh and then our special doctor friend in studio stay with us we've all heard about the
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:53.120]  pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that when
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:57.280]  they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they
[1:57:57.280 --> 1:58:02.560]  came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally and they came
[1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:06.560]  for him there was nobody else to stand up oh the global social credit score the china is putting
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:10.880]  in it's banning people the three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government
[1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:15.360]  you can never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought here and all over the world under
[1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:20.880]  the guise of covid vaccine passports they even admit it now there's a it's going to be a carbon
[1:58:20.880 --> 1:58:25.120]  tax attached to it they're going to track where you go what you do and decide where you can go and
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:29.600]  what you can do that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything
[1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:35.040]  so again the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:38.960]  they're part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well
[1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:43.040]  we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by
[1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:50.080]  this horrible technocracy run by the globalists the purpose of fear is to call us into action
[1:58:50.080 --> 1:58:55.680]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested
[1:58:55.680 --> 1:59:00.880]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible
[1:59:00.880 --> 1:59:06.800]  asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80%
[1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:12.640]  of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years
[1:59:12.640 --> 1:59:17.200]  for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's
[1:59:17.200 --> 1:59:23.600]  unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm
[1:59:23.600 --> 1:59:28.800]  because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win but even
[1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:34.560]  when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we
[1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:41.520]  must prepare get up to a years worth of storable foods water filtration survival gear seeds
[1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:46.400]  shortwave radios and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com
[1:59:46.400 --> 1:59:52.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:07.600]  all right we've got a very special doctor in studio with us with huge news coming up next segment
[2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:12.640]  please stay with us but here is a major whistleblower hospital physicians assistant
[2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:18.480]  Deborah Conrad laying it all out i can say for sure in 2021 this is the year of pneumonia
[2:00:19.200 --> 2:00:25.360]  independent of covid i've never seen people with so many pneumonia sepsis and even in the middle of
[2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:30.240]  summer you know all summer that's what we would get in the hospitals pneumonia pneumonia
[2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:36.240]  after the vaccine rollout i definitely noticed an uptick in heart attacks strokes blood clots
[2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:43.680]  gastrointestinal bleeds gastrointestinal complaints appendicitis uh we even saw pancreatitis
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:50.800]  recurrent cancers it was noticeably increased where it wasn't just me noticing it was
[2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:55.760]  everybody seemed to notice it it became clear to me that there was something wrong
[2:00:57.440 --> 2:01:02.160]  i knew nothing of theirs uh the vaccine adverse event reporting system i didn't know about our
[2:01:02.160 --> 2:01:08.080]  responsibility to report it was never even talked about when these vaccines were rolled out i mean
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:15.120]  you'd hear it in the news here and there but there was never this push to make sure providers were
[2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:20.320]  made aware that if you're getting patients in the hospital with issues these issues whatever
[2:01:20.320 --> 2:01:24.560]  that here here you got to go to this website and start reporting and start paying attention to
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:32.400]  stuff that was never educated to us at all and i went on the website i looked in the first thing i
[2:01:32.400 --> 2:01:39.120]  noticed was that it said healthcare providers are required by law to report certain adverse reactions
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:45.360]  to theirs and i i said what do you mean like what law so and then you look further and it had a whole
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:50.480]  section on it exactly what you're supposed to report specific things you're supposed to report
[2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:56.720]  to theirs after the covid vaccine rollout so that's when i started um reporting patients on my own
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:02:03.360]  well very quickly that became a full-time job in and of itself i would say within three weeks to
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:10.560]  a month i had already had 50 patients reported um and that was just of the providers that were
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:16.320]  willing to tell me about patients recognized that there may be a problem so i went back to my
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:22.480]  administration and i said i need help you know like i can't do this all myself it's overwhelming
[2:02:22.480 --> 2:02:26.880]  i'm on the phone with the cdc all the time i'm on the phone with these patients i need more people
[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:31.840]  to know about it so they can help me and we can do the right thing but that was met with then resistance
[2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:36.160]  because that's when the vaccines were really starting to get pushed everybody's got to get
[2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:42.320]  vaccinated this is how it's going to go and by me admitting that we need to report because there
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:47.120]  may be some issues they would create vaccine hesitancy amongst the health care workers amongst
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:53.680]  the staff amongst the other staff amongst the patients well that's when things changed because
[2:02:53.680 --> 2:03:01.280]  i i wouldn't be quiet about it and what i did was i put envelopes in our emergency room and told
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:05.680]  many of the providers hey if you get a patient that comes in and they just got their vaccine or
[2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:12.320]  you think something might be related in any way go ahead and put their demographics in the envelope
[2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:15.200]  and then i'll take care of it and call the patient and get the report done
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:21.920]  thinking it was only going to be a few reports a week no it turned into like i said a full time
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:34.400]  job very quickly why are we not wanting to report that i don't i don't know that the matter is not
[2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:40.960]  wanting to report it i think the the position that the system has taken is that each provider
[2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:44.560]  has a responsibility to report on their own patient but if the providers aren't provided
[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:49.200]  education on what we're supposed to be reporting the importance of such how do they only deal
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:53.040]  but i believe the providers should educate themselves when they're when they're dealing
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:58.320]  with uh patients related to COVID vaccination they don't even realize that these are specifically
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:03.680]  the conditions that we're supposed to be reporting to theirs so when we had a ton of them i mean we
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:10.720]  get thrombocytopenia blood clot just Tuesday i think it was we shipped out i think three party
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:16.080]  on my office the blood clot we got a guy on the floor and what he just died i just pronounced him
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:22.480]  a second ago who got his shot and literally two weeks later the guy ends up with full of such
[2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:26.960]  cancers blown out of nowhere a portal vein drawn this like
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:34.080]  it's stroked by the lady that they had a stroke within 48 hours of her vaccine fully
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:40.480]  on anticoagulation i had a lady have a bilateral t and she was on alipsoid after her vaccination
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:45.280]  i know these are things that are reportable that our hospital system talked to their risk
[2:04:45.280 --> 2:04:52.720]  management team and i was no longer allowed to report on any other patient but patients of my
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:57.680]  own that i saw where there was a warning that i was told i must support i'll tell you what's
[2:04:57.680 --> 2:05:02.960]  life and death if you don't have freedom of speech if if you don't have the right to be able to
[2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:08.560]  communicate then you don't have a future always when governments take away speech they then enslave
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:13.360]  the population and then they finally start exterminating the population and america the entire world
[2:05:13.360 --> 2:05:18.400]  is going down the tubes because the un globals directed great reset that's why it's more important

[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:39.680]  of people at my free doctor dot com benjamin marble md uh since uh completing his residency
[2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:46.640]  in the year 2000 after marble has worked for over 40 000 hours as an er physician he's also done
[2:06:46.640 --> 2:06:52.080]  part-time work in urgent care since 2014 he's been working full-time er physician at george regional
[2:06:52.080 --> 2:06:57.680]  hospital um and he's here with us right now my free doctor dot com and they're going after
[2:06:57.680 --> 2:07:01.680]  his medical license like they're doing thousands of others because he's actually prescribing
[2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:06.400]  things to people that is helping them they're now going after online pharmacies and mom and pops
[2:07:06.400 --> 2:07:12.400]  oh don't get people be decedent even though in a oxford study uh it it saves the vast
[2:07:12.400 --> 2:07:17.280]  majority of people that get it it's amazing so he's here to talk about all that also from when
[2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:22.400]  he was in college doing research on genetics and uh you know the dna and kind of the secret of this
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:27.440]  vaccine i agree with his analysis that's at the bottom of the hour that's secret my free doctor
[2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:33.600]  dot com he's here with us doc thanks for coming to town there's so much to cover i i i want to get
[2:07:33.600 --> 2:07:39.280]  into blocking treatments uh the vaccine's not working i mean anything you want to cover your
[2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:44.240]  most important info you want to impart but then i want to get into what do you make of it coming
[2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:47.840]  out that they didn't just do gain a function they wanted to release it into the population
[2:07:47.840 --> 2:07:53.040]  and quote habit spread to humans through skin penetrating nanoparticles close quote i mean
[2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:59.280]  this is everything we had evidence of now all confirmed the pentagon declassifying that
[2:07:59.280 --> 2:08:03.840]  he was approached by falchion peter dazik for bill gates and the pentagon said no this could kill
[2:08:03.840 --> 2:08:07.920]  humans uh and i think they were trying to blackmail the pentagon hoping they would have green lit this
[2:08:07.920 --> 2:08:13.200]  what do you think i think i call him dr death falsi and i think he's the greatest mass murder
[2:08:13.200 --> 2:08:19.360]  in human history he's responsible for all the 200 million deaths uh since covet began because he uh
[2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:26.080]  paid for it to be created and as you just uh have released the information today uh they released it
[2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:33.040]  on purpose that's you know you know funding it he obviously funded the wuhan lab the gain of function
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:37.200]  research that they did so it's all in the open we all know the truth now everybody knows what's
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:42.640]  going on at this point if you anybody that's been paying attention uh to to the news and following
[2:08:42.640 --> 2:08:47.920]  what's really happening is should be aware of this the man needs to be arrested i disagree a little
[2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:52.480]  bit i think we should offer him life in prison as a as an olive branch because i think we need a
[2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:56.560]  global ban on the death penalty and the reason why i think we need a global ban on death penalty
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:02.400]  is uh the government shouldn't be killing people with lethal injections uh electric chairs or anything
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:07.360]  i think i i was being tongue-in-cheek yes sir i understand i think that would be the the christian
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:12.160]  thing to do to let him live i mean he is kill i mean i mean look look look he lied to congress
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:15.920]  like seven times that i've never been involved in any function when he's on video saying i want
[2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:20.880]  gain a function he's he's in signed emails saying build me gain a function with these four viruses
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:25.360]  and add the hiv spike protein telling peter dazzic make this for me i mean it's like it's
[2:09:25.360 --> 2:09:30.640]  like if i went to a restaurant said uh you know make me a ham and eggs over easy i mean he freaking
[2:09:30.640 --> 2:09:37.280]  ordered it correct he sure did it's very obvious he's lying uh and uh you know all the proofs there
[2:09:37.280 --> 2:09:42.080]  for the people who do who can actually read and do their own research look it up up for yourself
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:48.080]  on duck duck go or google or whatever but um the evidence is there uh the man needs to be arrested
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:52.320]  he's a criminal he's a mass murderer and he's so far getting away with it the fact that he
[2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:59.520]  still has a job is is incredible let's get into that more but just it turns out i met you in 2006
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:03.120]  i guess in new york at an island memorial yes sir you do seem vaguely familiar your face but i've
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:07.360]  seen you online in videos talk about what you've seen in the last 20 months since this whole
[2:10:07.360 --> 2:10:12.240]  started or 21 months and and now where you think it's going and just as a physician what you've
[2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:18.560]  witnessed well i would say this you know there uh we've seen lots of death and misery and and bad
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:25.760]  side effects from the lethal injections uh the big picture problem is their in population goal the
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:31.920]  global elite bill cemetery gates and friends uh their in population goal is is half a billion
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:35.360]  people there's eight billion people right on the planet right now so that means they want
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:40.880]  7.5 billion people to die so far they delivered five billion lethal injections that means they're
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:45.120]  two-thirds of the weight of their goal so this is kind of why i think this information is coming
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:49.280]  out now they're almost their goal is almost complete so so they're getting ready to throw
[2:10:49.280 --> 2:10:54.800]  dr death falsely under the bus very astute because you know that's in the spars document that when
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:11:00.560]  we learn of it then they'll just burn the so-called frontmen yeah he's he's an 80-something-year-old
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:06.000]  man so throwing him under the bus will be very easy thing to do continue doctor telling us what
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:11.200]  you think it's about to happen so the big problem is is five billion doses of lethal injection
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:17.760]  have already been given so if we stop the lethal injections tomorrow uh uh uh the luke dr luke
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:22.640]  montag montanier he's a nobel prize winner he believes that everybody who's had the lethal
[2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:27.600]  injection will be dead in two to three years he did say that he's the he's the isolator of hiv
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:33.200]  nobel prize of virology yeah he does say that i agree with that position from the many thousands
[2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:37.600]  of articles i've read on this subject in the past year and a half i i agree that these are lethal
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:41.280]  injections if you design a lethal injection you know you can design a lethal injection to kill
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:45.840]  in minutes hours days weeks months or years but that'd be too obvious if it kills in minutes
[2:11:45.840 --> 2:11:49.520]  you know it's a lethal injection but if it kills in months or years then you're just a conspiracy
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:56.400]  theorist very well said sir so keep laying that out for people so if if you know five
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:00.720]  billion doses have already been given the problem is the greatest mass die-off in human history is
[2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:05.360]  coming the dark winter is coming we've never had that many people died all at one time this is
[2:12:05.360 --> 2:12:10.320]  going to cause the greatest depression in human history and uh it's going to overwhelm all hospital
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:16.880]  systems globally i saw where you said that over a year ago and then now it's in the east coast
[2:12:16.880 --> 2:12:20.880]  newspapers particularly like connecticut where the schools are having to close and shut down not of
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:26.240]  covid but because they're so sick from the shots correct you take a look at israel israel's the highest
[2:12:26.240 --> 2:12:30.560]  vaccinated country on the planet and they have the highest covid rate on the planet the people in
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:34.640]  israel that have been vaccinated have a five times higher death rate than the unvaccinated
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:39.840]  please continue doc you're laying a lot of knowledge on the people what people don't understand
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:46.160]  is when you get the vaccine the vaccine the back or the lethal the lethal injection uh it turns you
[2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:51.520]  into a covid carrier super spreader you said spike proteins everywhere you go so the the
[2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:56.240]  thing people need to be aware of like especially pregnant women they need to everybody should
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:13:01.600]  treat people who've been who've had the lethal injection as if they have active covid especially
[2:13:01.600 --> 2:13:06.320]  pregnant women we've had cases of pregnant women i had a 34 week pregnant woman that was around
[2:13:06.320 --> 2:13:11.440]  somebody who had just been recently vaccinated lost her baby we've got dozens you know probably
[2:13:11.440 --> 2:13:16.480]  hundreds and thousands of cases and examples of this i mean i and by the way that's it fizer got a
[2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:20.720]  law passed in the e u that they that the vaccine does shed and they're allowed to shed so they're
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:24.800]  not denying us correct and they've finally admitted that truth i mean we've known that for
[2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:28.080]  a while the physicians have known for quite a while about this did you notice lands it finally
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:30.880]  came out and said hey you shouldn't give it to pregnant women so they went ahead and gave it
[2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:35.760]  a bunch of pregnant women it caused what 83 miscarriages in the first two trimesters not in
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:39.520]  the third and then now they're like hey you might not do that i mean this has just been an exercise
[2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:45.760]  of evil pure evil at the core of what's going on right now i call it falsely science the billionaire
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:51.040]  elite class they put they pay for all the research so if they uh there's one study that gives them
[2:13:51.040 --> 2:13:55.280]  results that'll make them money that's the study they published but they bury the nine studies that
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:59.840]  that won't make them money so that's falsely science so we have dr death falsely promoting
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:05.600]  falsely science we have falsely doctors following the what i call euthanasia protocols that they
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:10.960]  they have in the hospitals and uh and they're killing basically the hospitals are like concentration
[2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:16.880]  camps right now where they're often the patients and again the average person i mean you work in
[2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:22.400]  a hospital uh they're compartmentalized from and we see the veritas whistleblowers they've got the
[2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:25.760]  nurses and doctors admitting no we know the vaccine is killing people but we can't say anything yeah
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:30.000]  the doctors are afraid to speak up doctors and you know that's the thing this is the that's the big
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:33.920]  question i should be asking you is what is it like in a hospital how many people are awake those
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:40.240]  are awake what do you do i i actually stopped working in the hospital in march you know why i
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:45.120]  quit because they kept trying to force me to get the lethal injection after i'd recovered from
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:49.520]  coveted with i have natural immunity i recovered from coveted three times in a row they came to me
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:53.680]  demanding that i take the shot after i'd already recovered and the third time they came to me with
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:14:57.840]  it i just said you know what i've already refused that twice i you know i had coveted and recovered
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:01.040]  and you're trying to force me to take something i don't want to take so that's nothing i've heard
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:04.400]  doctors now see the studies you're not supposed to take a vaccine even if it's a good vaccine
[2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:09.360]  yet you're safe if you've already had something explain why and they know that but Fauci the
[2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:13.200]  surgeon general says that it learned immunity is no good he says naturally that's like saying

[2:18:04.160 --> 2:18:09.440]  government two days ago on january 6 and i just want you to know i've taken control of the nuclear
[2:18:09.440 --> 2:18:13.840]  weapons and if trump tries to launch an attack on you we'll let you know first the attack's coming
[2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:21.120]  that is from the transcript then he called up polosi schumer and others to say i'm loyal to
[2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:25.520]  you i'm gonna protect trump from using nuclear weapons but trump was going for detente with
[2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:30.160]  china and north korea at the time and trumps responded saying it's a total lie polosi's come
[2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:35.600]  out admitted it happened hell she bragged back on january 8 that it took place then and is saying
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:40.320]  that she honors milley and that he's this courageous person so we're all these other democrats so
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:44.880]  this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming out of the
[2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:50.240]  shadows publicly remember these people literally hate you and your family now they're injecting you
[2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:59.440]  with poison soft kill injections wake up america or be destroyed it's only been in the last 60 years
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:05.360]  that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere but if you
[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:09.200]  look at all the different studies reports about my nasa and other governments and other agencies
[2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:14.800]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate the only constant the only great truth
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:22.240]  is change is the only constant so yes climate change is totally real but notice first they called
[2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:26.560]  it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:31.200]  really happen the way they wanted to okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man
[2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:37.920]  made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the united nations and the department of energy
[2:19:37.920 --> 2:19:43.840]  and bill gates and the un they have weather control trees for 1979 and bill gates has been
[2:19:43.840 --> 2:19:48.720]  manipulating the weather for a very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel
[2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:53.600]  prize for an idea of spring different particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes
[2:19:53.600 --> 2:20:03.120]  man made climate change is real you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:21.120]  boussy's name means the sickle the grim reaper comes from the 14th century in italy during the
[2:20:21.120 --> 2:20:27.520]  black plague from the very town the hell's from our little grim reaper and i don't care the reaper
[2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:32.320]  when god calls me but i'm not gonna let fouchy and mill gates take me without a fight i was talking
[2:20:32.320 --> 2:20:38.000]  to our special guest dr benjamin marble md of myfreedoctor.com and he was very excited about
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:41.840]  some of the good news we'll talk about the big picture and fouchy and the documents next segment
[2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:46.560]  and this mark they're putting on our dna very biblical in my view i agree with him
[2:20:46.560 --> 2:20:51.840]  is newly appointed florida surgeon general says state done with fear vaccine treated
[2:20:51.840 --> 2:20:56.160]  like a religion and we're going to talk about this doctor that turns out our doctor friend knows
[2:20:56.160 --> 2:20:59.200]  i don't want to say too much nice about him i'm getting trouble also american airline
[2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:04.480]  ceo says biden men shouldn't require vaccines for travel so people are starting to wake up major
[2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:09.520]  backlash we are vaccinated enough curation president blast covid hysteria media fear
[2:21:09.520 --> 2:21:15.280]  campaign so the world is pushing back same thing in australia same thing here uh so doctor let's
[2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:22.400]  let's talk about the good news here and things like this happening certainly the good news is that
[2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:26.880]  the multiple drug early treatment that we can deliver prescriptions for free to our patients
[2:21:27.680 --> 2:21:33.280]  works we've we've delivered you know i'm literally i'm the doctor who's helped treat more covid
[2:21:33.280 --> 2:21:38.480]  patients than any doctor on the planet we've treated 32 000 covid patients we have a 99.9
[2:21:38.480 --> 2:21:43.360]  percent survival rate using our multiple drug early protocol which happens to be the same protocol
[2:21:43.360 --> 2:21:48.720]  that jay rogan took absolutely and and you've got a bunch of doctors in your group you were
[2:21:48.720 --> 2:21:52.400]  telling me during the break that they're trying to take your license in another state because
[2:21:52.400 --> 2:21:56.080]  you've been prescribing ivermectin i mean my parents my dad was almost dead didn't tell me
[2:21:56.080 --> 2:22:01.440]  he was sick for a week and a half he got ivermectin and he physically was 90 better the next day as
[2:22:01.440 --> 2:22:06.160]  he had brain fog for a while still a little bit from it but i mean he was again not able to get
[2:22:06.160 --> 2:22:14.160]  up 82 oxygen 94 oxygen the next day after ivermectin i mean it was just bam yeah ivermectin is a
[2:22:14.160 --> 2:22:18.960]  great drug you know there's no one drug that's a miracle cure it's really the combination of the
[2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:24.720]  multiple drugs uh some of which are prescription we use low cost generic drugs ivermectin hydroxy
[2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:31.200]  chloroquine uh prednisone judesin he was doing all that as well but i mean it was that combination
[2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:37.680]  the dr bartlett prescribed just bam yep dr bartlett is awesome by the way uh he his research
[2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:44.880]  on buesonite has been groundbreaking and has helped save a lot of lives so so doc i interrupted you
[2:22:44.880 --> 2:22:51.840]  there continue getting into how we fight back how do people up front because these are all things
[2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:56.240]  that aren't like drugs that get you hire anything people should be able to stockpile this stuff uh
[2:22:56.240 --> 2:23:00.560]  or obviously once they start getting sick and need to quickly act people blow my phones off the
[2:23:00.560 --> 2:23:05.760]  hook here emails how do i get this my local doctor won't prescribe it i have covid they won't give it
[2:23:05.760 --> 2:23:11.280]  to me tell people how they do it go to my free doctor dot com and follow the we have a simple
[2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:16.240]  easy three step process and you the first step you download that the second step you put in your
[2:23:16.240 --> 2:23:20.160]  pharmacy the third step you answer a series of questions and after that our tech support team
[2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:24.880]  will add you to a doctor and then doctor can read your case and send your prescriptions the
[2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:29.680]  prescriptions are sent for free uh then we will send your discharge instructions and then we'll
[2:23:29.680 --> 2:23:33.520]  ask for a donation and if you can donate that's great if you can't that's fine because we're trying
[2:23:33.520 --> 2:23:38.880]  to save lives and meanwhile i know that regeneron's helping a lot of people so now biden's trying to
[2:23:38.880 --> 2:23:43.120]  block that i mean there's just no end to the evil here everything that works and is shown to be a
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:48.480]  benefit they try to block and isn't that of not just having the smoking documents from Fauci we'll
[2:23:48.480 --> 2:23:52.640]  cover next segment but them trying to block doctors that were doing intervening as vitamin c
[2:23:52.640 --> 2:23:59.200]  which the study shows great or vitamin d saying oh that's bad don't use it or uh you know ivermectin
[2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:04.320]  or hydroxychloroquine or now rindesivir is approved for it 500 million doses you only need one dose
[2:24:04.960 --> 2:24:08.880]  massively helps people i know that you took it more better like five hours later like
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:11.680]  you're one of the crew members here took it five better five hours later couldn't breathe
[2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:14.560]  i'm not saying it's gonna do that for everybody but most people it does within a day or less
[2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:20.080]  trying to block that now that's an approved thing they're blocking i mean this is evil yeah that's
[2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:24.640]  a regeneron and uh that's the monoclonal antibody the monoclonal antibody is part of the protocol and
[2:24:24.640 --> 2:24:30.400]  it's great uh the rindesivir however i call it rindesivir that's a horrible drug that causes
[2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:34.800]  renal failure and and liver problems and that's what Fauci recommends tell us about that they need
[2:24:34.800 --> 2:24:38.560]  to pull that one off the market do you know the fda's traditionally the problem is i call it that
[2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:42.560]  i say rindesivir instead of regeneron you did that's why i correctly jumped i know no correct me i
[2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:48.160]  know i know rindesivir is horrible no rindesivir regeneron regeneron regeneron regeneron regeneron
[2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:52.080]  totally separate the other makes your kidneys fail correct you gotta that's why i don't make
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:58.480]  mistakes on purpose talk sorry that's right regeneron regeneron regeneron is good rindesivir
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:04.400]  is bad i mean the whole show on that last week tell people about it rindesivir um is a is a bad
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:08.560]  drug it causes renal failure the majority of patients who get it you know if you go into a
[2:25:08.560 --> 2:25:13.440]  hospital right now i i tell people now at the point it's like if we would compare now to world
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:19.760]  war two 2021 versus 1941 it's like the hospitals are the concentration camps where they send people
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:24.880]  to get to get rid of them to dispose of them and then they isolate you they all let your family
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:29.680]  visit they give you a drug that causes renal failure makes you worse they intubate you no
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:37.760]  family is allowed in and you die alone it's horrible the compartmentalization you i'm sure
[2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:41.520]  you've seen these project varitas whistleblowers a new one just came out sure where they know the
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:45.200]  shots are killing them but they say we're not supposed to tell anybody they have audio and
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:50.800]  video of this i mean this is murder it is and the sad thing about it is so many healthcare
[2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:55.440]  workers nurses and doctors that are just afraid to speak up because they might lose their job
[2:25:55.440 --> 2:25:58.080]  we're just following orders well that's what the nazi soldiers said
[2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:06.160]  how would i mean we had a lady on yesterday who was a nurse working for health and human services
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:10.400]  and she said her friend died from COVID they wouldn't even give her steroids or things that
[2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:16.720]  they knew were helping they even their own friend they killed correct and they will not defy the cdc
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:21.520]  and the fda the protocols it's like these are the orders from on high and you must follow them you
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:27.200]  can't deviate and that's never happened before in medicine always doctors have been allowed to
[2:26:27.200 --> 2:26:33.280]  use their own judgment and will and to devise the best treatment for each individual patient but
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:37.920]  that's no longer allowed that's not tolerated and and the falsely doctors just follow follow
[2:26:37.920 --> 2:26:43.760]  in lockstep following dr death falsely's orders and i want to be clear because people always say
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:49.840]  you know jones is super accurate at other than messing names up and i'll switch things rendezavir's
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:55.680]  horrible turns off your kidneys and a bunch of organ failure on record mainstream news that's
[2:26:55.680 --> 2:27:01.600]  what fax recommended doesn't help you it kills you i mean devastates you it's regeneran i've also
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:07.120]  been told by medical doctors the elie lily um system doesn't work anymore because the virus
[2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:11.920]  is mutated or whatever they say regeneran's the one that's got a shot uh is that what you've heard
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:17.280]  doc uh yes sir that's another brings up another interesting point the the lethal injections
[2:27:17.280 --> 2:27:23.600]  do not even work against the delta variant variant so why would you take uh thank the lethal injection
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:27.760]  that doesn't even work for the current variant that's that's out and doctors elenco calls it the
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:33.120]  death shot but i like yours it's the lethal injection it is a lethal injection is by opinion
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:39.680]  ask the 20 20 000 plus people on open veirs dot com that died that from the cdc's own numbers
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:45.200]  and then if you look at veirs harvard did a study only they only report one percent of the desk get
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:51.760]  reported so the real number is probably closer to you know a quarter of a million at least i know
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:55.200]  everybody i know has had family members that died or had a heart attack or a blood clot
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:00.720]  from these shots and then we open the phones up it's just devastation hundreds of calls in a row
[2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:05.840]  about my mother my brother my daughter my son a whole bunch of children young people tenors
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:11.280]  have died in austin from the shots the heart attacks they tell me how the shot killed him yeah
[2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:17.200]  it's it's a medical i call it the medical marxist covid cult and it's a global mass psychosis
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:22.320]  that has happened to the whole world and all the people who have been drinking the kool-aid
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:27.600]  and again the the communists that run this thing are controlled by a bunch of big bankers but it is
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:31.520]  a communist system they kill people that don't follow communist takeover well you're being killed
[2:28:31.520 --> 2:28:35.120]  they just can't come out with a gun and do it because we're armed so they do it by a virus
[2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:38.480]  they cook up at willow and release on purpose i've been telling you that and now the documents
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:43.280]  have come out that fauci released it on purpose he asked the pentagon to go along with it they said no
[2:28:43.280 --> 2:28:48.560]  and we'll talk about that with dr marble on the other side i'm alex jones info wars dot com his
[2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:57.440]  side is my free doctor dot com my free doctor dot com if you're concerned about the power grid and

[2:29:02.480 --> 2:29:07.920]  message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar generators
[2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:14.160]  back in stock these emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most
[2:29:14.160 --> 2:29:20.320]  and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes and produce an
[2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:25.520]  endless supply of free electricity from the sun whether it's wildfires dangerous whether power
[2:29:25.520 --> 2:29:31.040]  grid issues or just getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages
[2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:37.360]  again even better all this week radio listeners get over 700 dollars in free off-the-grid bonuses

[2:29:57.280 --> 2:30:04.080]  globalist general milley has revealed to the world that the united states is not a free republic
[2:30:04.080 --> 2:30:09.440]  but is run by a permanent statewide network bureaucracy the big takeaway here is is that he
[2:30:09.440 --> 2:30:16.000]  didn't act alone he felt that he was safe to talk on an overseas phone line system that he knew was
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:21.280]  being watched by not just our government the five eyes the russians and the chinese he wanted the
[2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:26.160]  world to know that he was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state
[2:30:26.160 --> 2:30:30.960]  this permanent bureaucracy sees america as its enemy it sees the american people as its enemy
[2:30:30.960 --> 2:30:37.040]  it sees prosperity as its enemy and it conspired with the communist chinese to threaten them basically
[2:30:37.040 --> 2:30:43.120]  and say trump may nuke you but if he tries we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond
[2:30:43.120 --> 2:30:48.640]  first that's beyond treason but it shows the type of anti-american sycophants living in their own
[2:30:48.640 --> 2:30:54.640]  fetid bubble they try to get away with this milley and all of his accomplices to go to prison now for life
[2:30:56.880 --> 2:31:03.280]  it is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told
[2:31:03.280 --> 2:31:08.720]  and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated
[2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:14.000]  water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:19.120]  the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have been
[2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:24.640]  known for millennia the hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the
[2:31:24.640 --> 2:31:31.040]  pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what
[2:31:31.040 --> 2:31:37.120]  connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality
[2:31:37.120 --> 2:31:43.920]  fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems

[2:33:16.640 --> 2:33:25.040]  well i tell you i love the sanis new surgeon general saying people are treating the vaccine
[2:33:25.040 --> 2:33:29.920]  like a religion we're done with the fear that is exciting i want to play a club of the sanis
[2:33:29.920 --> 2:33:34.640]  introducing him in a moment but we have dr benjamin marble md with us he's going to be back
[2:33:34.640 --> 2:33:41.040]  on the mar is going to stay with us a few days he's from florida from my freedoctor.com and he
[2:33:41.040 --> 2:33:44.800]  is here exposing what's happening and they're trying to get take his license the democrats
[2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:50.160]  are attacking their web service telling them that they can't operate online or having to move
[2:33:50.160 --> 2:33:56.240]  their web service all because he's giving people things in major studies that help them remember
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:01.520]  the media is running fake stories about ivermectin they're engaged in all these incredible lies
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:07.120]  they're lying about eudesidine it's just insane and there's a well-known republican lady who i'm
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:14.480]  going to get on the show who was in dallas for a trip got deathly ill and was in couldn't get any
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:18.560]  doctors to prescribe anything to her we got a doctor to prescribe her the stuff but then the
[2:34:18.560 --> 2:34:23.360]  pharmacies wouldn't give it to her husband so we had some extra we drove it to her and one day later
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:27.600]  she was on the road and basically 90% better and she couldn't even get up or move by the time we
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:32.400]  got her to bedessa dying and the ivermectin the rest of it so if the government says oh legalize
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:38.480]  all these drugs the fda you know said oxy cotton for children and fentanyl but oh don't give somebody
[2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:44.400]  aerosolized anti-inflammatory steroids it's just insane it's a doctor you're making some great
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:49.760]  points during the break please elaborate on that well i would like to make one point and that's uh
[2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:55.040]  i brought some ivermectin with me ivermectin is a great very safe drug more deaths from Tylenol
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:59.840]  every year than all the years ivermectin has been in use so i'm going to go ahead and take my dose
[2:34:59.840 --> 2:35:04.960]  of ivermectin right now and and what does ivermectin do in the body because the democrats when i
[2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:10.720]  did that went oh it's fake he wouldn't dare take that himself it's like cyanide that's just so it
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:17.760]  is the way they try to vilify the drugs is just insane uh covid is a disease there's the problem
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:22.080]  with the viral load there's a problem with inflammation there's problem with clots so we
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:26.720]  we can use safe generic low-cost drugs to help with the inflammation and with the clots there are
[2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:31.280]  our drugs that are shown to help help reduce the viral load ivermectin has a secondary
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:36.080]  antiviral action it's well proven well documented that's the reason why it won the Nobel Prize
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:41.280]  well i mean we have the proof now now with Regeneron they're trying to block that it's
[2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:47.840]  approved for covid a new study shows that just washing your sinuses and gargling with a little
[2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:52.000]  betadine solution will help reduce oh yeah good old iodine they're trying to block that
[2:35:54.800 --> 2:35:58.960]  that's right my wife had a lot of family that was sick when she visited them in Omaha with covid
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:03.520]  and so their studies on silver folks or NIH that went out of Mexico City at their general hospital
[2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:07.600]  she went there and she'd always bought colloidal silver there for sword throats or whatever
[2:36:07.600 --> 2:36:12.240]  and they said oh we don't sell that now because people were taking it for covid yeah so basically
[2:36:12.240 --> 2:36:17.280]  when you reach the conclusion that all the decisions they make are designed to maximize
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:23.280]  death then all their decisions make a whole bunch of sense and then you learn that for people that
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:27.840]  just tuned in you're a medical doctor a well-known one what is the magnitude of wool on scientists
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:32.880]  plan to release chimeric covid spike proteins in a bat population skin penetrating nanoparticles
[2:36:32.880 --> 2:36:39.120]  close quote i mean and then it has the hiv delivery system in it this is from peter dazik and Fauci's
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:45.040]  own proposal to the pentagon in DARPA it's all here wool on scientists plan to release
[2:36:45.040 --> 2:36:49.440]  enhanced coronavirus and the bat caves for covid outbreak to then spread to humans they said they
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:54.560]  wanted it to be able to infect humans i mean it's all here this is open and shut that they were
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:37:00.720]  releasing on purpose absolutely there's no question that it is open and shut case uh all the evidence
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:06.960]  is there we've done you had you know hints of of and suspicions but there's so much amount of
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:10.960]  evidence now that you know only this you know people who've been drinking the kool-aid still
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:18.240]  believe dr. death falsely speaking of hope here a newly appointed florida surgeon general says state
[2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:23.680]  done with fear vaccine treated like a religion and i want to get into the biblical angles on this
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:32.240]  and here is uh him being introduced by the governor he is dr. joseph latipo the new florida
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:38.560]  surgeon general here it is florida's next top doc has a problem with mask and vaccine mandates
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:43.920]  this afternoon governor desantis announcing he is tapping dr. joe lapato to be surgeon general
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:49.360]  and health secretary so why is this such a controversial pick for some capital reporter
[2:37:49.360 --> 2:37:57.120]  for saunders in tallahassee dr. latipo is in and his first words to the press corps tuesday
[2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:02.560]  no more covet scare tactics we're done with fear we're not that's been something that's
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:08.240]  been unfortunately a centerpiece of health policy in the united states ever since the beginning
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:13.920]  of the pandemic latipo replaces dr. scott rivkes who departed monday but has largely been out of
[2:38:13.920 --> 2:38:18.560]  public views since last year rivkes was pulled from a press conference after recommending social
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:25.120]  distancing until a vaccine was ready dr. latipo is a former ucla physician and health policy
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:29.840]  researcher with an md from harvard the governor saying his credentials alone make him a top choice
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:36.880]  for any state a superb background bringing superb intellect but also i think will bring a great
[2:38:36.880 --> 2:38:42.560]  leadership but desantis and latipo also seemed lockstep on ideology both discouraging mandates
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:49.680]  and favoring individual choice how can the right answer be to limit physicians use of the medication
[2:38:49.680 --> 2:38:54.800]  latipo is also a proponent of the hyped now debunked covet treatment hydroxy chloroquine and
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:38:59.760]  he's penned several controversial pandemic op-eds entitled are covet vaccines riskier
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:05.680]  than advertised it is too late for shutdowns to save us and vaccine mandates can't stop covet
[2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:13.520]  spread the state should be promoting good health and vaccination isn't the only path to that it's
[2:39:13.520 --> 2:39:19.440]  been treated almost like a religion and it that's just senseless right the governor's office says
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:23.920]  latipo will hold the position until lawmakers vote on official approval though some have
[2:39:23.920 --> 2:39:29.280]  reservations given the doctor's rhetoric we need a surgeon general that believes in science
[2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:35.360]  that understands the nuances of public health and that means not questioning okay they put out a fake
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:39.680]  study on hydroxychloroquine last year that got withdrawn that bill gates funded and they admitted
[2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:44.320]  the study was fake later hydroxychloroquine pushes ink into the cells doc as you know as everybody
[2:39:44.320 --> 2:39:51.040]  knows they're damn liars okay so there you go again ladies and gentlemen there you go again
[2:39:51.040 --> 2:39:56.240]  and then again studies are out that social distancing even even the cdc says it's totally
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:01.600]  fake so this is i mean i like the sands even more now this guy's great the sands is the best
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:06.800]  governor in america he's doing an awesome job i'm really proud of him for selecting dr latipo
[2:40:06.800 --> 2:40:11.440]  to be our new surgeon general in florida what do you make of that news piece lying about the doctor
[2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:16.880]  saying oh well hydroxychloroquine's debunked that's falsely news for you spreading the falsely science
[2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:21.600]  also oh he's lying he says that the vaccine doesn't protect you they admit it doesn't protect you
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:28.880]  correct it's not it's you know the you know here's the thing it's not even a real vaccine uh they
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:34.000]  redefine the word vaccine to include this gene therapy they call it the software of life when
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  they first came out with it and then they decided well well let's just rename it vaccine that sounds
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:42.800]  better people like that well i'll tell you what the day that they uh said that it was okay for
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:48.800]  a poisonous lethal injection to be a vaccine that's the day i became anti-vax absolutely you know
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:53.440]  they say that oh this is just a vaccine as you said they admit this is a gene therapy i embraced
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:41:00.240]  the anti-vax label i'm not taking that lethal injection never nobody should i've talked about
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:03.920]  it some but i mean i've never recommended a single dose for a single patient i'm probably the only
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:08.560]  doctor you you meet that can say that because back in december i knew it was going to be unsafe
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:12.800]  rapid science is bad science and the fact that they made it super fast and oh trump was proud of
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:18.000]  that and all but uh he was listening to dr he got hoodwinked he got hoodwinked they misled him on
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:22.400]  the bad side what about this doc everybody i know that's gone and asked their doctor would you take
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:26.480]  this the doctor won't administer it they say go to walmart go to walgreens they don't want the
[2:41:26.480 --> 2:41:30.320]  liability they won't say which one's better or worse or if they're good because they know there's
[2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:35.440]  liability that that should tell you something correct the doctors can be sued the the the the
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:40.960]  cvs or walgreens uh the manufacturers they cannot be sued they're immune from from lawsuit so if
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:45.520]  your doctor won't administer something to you and tells you go to some immune megacorporation
[2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:51.760]  what's that tell you yeah it's not it's bad medicine and again folks challenge people that go oh why
[2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:56.000]  don't you go to your doctor and get it and ask for the insert oh that's right it's it's blank
[2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:01.440]  correct they have blank inserts uh you know it's still the fda approved they did uh they did a
[2:42:01.440 --> 2:42:06.640]  bait and switch on the on the media and the falsely news fell for it and they they um gave a
[2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:11.440]  they continued the emergency use authorization of the of the vaccine and they gave fda approval to
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:18.320]  the commonality vaccine which doesn't even exist yet doc uh you are gracious to stay in austin and
[2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:21.680]  we really appreciate you and i don't even you said you don't want to help and i'd like to pay for
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:26.080]  your hotel so you can uh stay and hopefully come on the uh american journal tomorrow with harris
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:29.920]  and smith and then the war room before you and then maybe fly tomorrow evening back to destin one
[2:42:29.920 --> 2:42:34.400]  of my favorite places in florida man going up in the panhandle at uh the actual fountain of youth
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:39.040]  and all that's amazing have you been there i have not been there uh no where where is that at well
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:43.680]  you know it's where the i forget how you pronounce the the condition or his name but he like found
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:47.680]  that beautiful fountain the land yeah yeah it's it's it's really there it's beautiful it's not the
[2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:51.520]  you don't live forever getting in it but damn feel like you are we'll have to be right back stay with
[2:42:51.520 --> 2:42:58.720]  us better in florida i'd move there in a minute i love it it's great biden and his corporate
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:06.000]  controllers are lying to you this is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated this is an engineered
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:13.600]  virus in a lab that they then injected into the public using their poison vaccine so the body then
[2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:19.920]  created mutations that actually spread even worse like the delta variant that is scientifically
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:26.480]  admitted that is mainline science and not even debated but the general public does not even
[2:43:26.480 --> 2:43:34.880]  know that so when that criminal with his pedophile crackhead son gets up there on television and tells
[2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:40.640]  you that you are to blame because you didn't take their poison shot that is a giant line
[2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:46.960]  countries like israel and singapore with the highest vaccine rate have the highest death
[2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:52.640]  and highest illness rates that is the facts get that information out to your friends family and
[2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:58.480]  strangers like your life depends on it because it does when bob woodward's new book came out
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:03.360]  alleging that general milley had called the head of the chinese military and said trump might
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:08.480]  nuke you you tried to overthrow the u.s. government but basically i'm protecting you and i'll warn you
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:13.200]  if we launch an attack which was the greatest reason us history that has ever been committed
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:17.920]  people said oh alex it must not be true and i might wait bob woodward's former naval intelligence
[2:44:17.920 --> 2:44:22.480]  he's a big insider globalist he wouldn't have flipped this out unless they wanted to put it out
[2:44:22.480 --> 2:44:27.440]  say that billy was a hero to set the precedent you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:31.920]  network deep state basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over america that's what he put
[2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:36.800]  by any so incredibly weak is to undermine the idea of the presidency well people said i was making
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:41.600]  it up with bob woodward's line well now milley admits he did it you see i didn't need to trust
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:46.480]  bob woodward i remember polosi on january 8th bragging that she'd gotten a call from milley
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:50.720]  that he'd take your control of the nukes so this treason was hiding in plain view back then and we
[2:44:50.720 --> 2:44:55.200]  covered it see i have a memory folks i remember all this stuff that's why i know it's true and what's
[2:44:55.200 --> 2:45:08.320]  false what our champions made of here's a man who can show you
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:59.560]  I'll tell you what's life and death.
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:04.560]  If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to communicate, then
[2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:09.880]  you don't have a future. Always when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population
[2:46:09.880 --> 2:46:13.680]  and then they finally start exterminating the population. And America, the entire world
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:18.400]  is going down the tubes because the UN Global's directed great reset. That's why it's more
[2:46:18.400 --> 2:46:22.320]  important than ever that InfoWars stay on the air and that all of us stay healthy. That's
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:27.560]  why I'm offering a bunch of our best-selling products at 50% off for a limited time only
[2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:33.160]  until the end of the month of September. That's only about 12, 13 days as of the time we're
[2:46:33.160 --> 2:46:38.040]  taping this. And that means all these amazing products. We have ultra 12, highest quality

[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  thank you.
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:12.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:12.360 --> 2:47:19.000]  And we are back live, final segment with our good friend here in studio, Dr. Marble, MD,
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:23.720]  myfreedoctor.com. We're going to be talking to him about this whole market of the B system
[2:47:23.720 --> 2:47:28.440]  and more. We'll put some of those images on the screen of what under electron microscope
[2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:32.880]  where our DNA actually looks at and what these globalists are talking about. That's
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:37.920]  in a moment. But first, please remember it is our sponsors that make it all possible.
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:41.200]  Any sponsor I promote is awesome. This is one of the best deals you're going to get
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:45.960]  on a satellite phone. You either pay for the minutes and get a phone at a reduced price
[2:47:45.960 --> 2:47:50.360]  or you pay a lot for the phone and then the minute still costs. The point is, everybody
[2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:54.480]  can call you for free on a satellite phone from cell phones, landlines. It just costs
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:48:00.760]  for you to call because it goes up to the satellite. So infowarsphone.com, when the cell towers
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:04.800]  go down or during any emergency you need it, or this is one that isn't trackable by the
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:09.200]  contact tracers and you can't basically be spied on very easily with one of these systems.
[2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:12.960]  So this isn't tracked like all the other cell phones. It was a great system to have in your
[2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:17.440]  home, in your car. Anywhere you're outside it works, you can also buy antennas for the
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:23.920]  car or for the home as well at infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020 and ask for the Alex Jones
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:28.960]  special, 941-955-1020 and you can call with their special. You just buy the minutes and
[2:48:28.960 --> 2:48:37.760]  you get a free $600 plus value phone, 941-955-1020, ask for the Alex special or infowarsphone.com
[2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:40.480]  and then please don't forget we have all the great vitamins and minerals and thanks for
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:46.080]  your immune system. Winter sun, back in stock, highest quality D3. It is back in stock and
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:51.640]  we also have ultra-12 high quality vitamin B12 and infowarsstore.com back in stock, both
[2:48:51.640 --> 2:48:58.760]  50% off those cells end on Monday. All right, Dr. Benjamin Marble, let's get into this image.
[2:48:58.760 --> 2:49:03.240]  You saved many years ago, I guess we're seeing in medical school. We have it on screen to show
[2:49:03.240 --> 2:49:07.240]  people that who has understanding reckon the number of the beast. It is a human number and
[2:49:07.240 --> 2:49:13.080]  this is what you're saying DNA actually looks like under a microscope and I know this is all
[2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:20.760]  very occultic. A bunch of the patents for these vaccines are like 666 or 6060 and Bill Gates has
[2:49:20.760 --> 2:49:26.760]  got all this nanotech stuff that he wants to track and control us with. What is your biblical as a
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:33.640]  Christian angle on this? Well, that image I saw in my biochemistry class in 1993 and it freaked
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:38.840]  me out so badly that I had my professor give me a copy of it and I saved it for all these years
[2:49:38.840 --> 2:49:44.440]  because I thought one day I might need this. There it is, there it is, tell us what that is.
[2:49:44.440 --> 2:49:50.840]  So that's a magnified image of human DNA at the molecular level showing it's a double-stranded
[2:49:50.840 --> 2:49:56.760]  triple helix two times three equals six and it happens to visually look just like a bunch of
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:50:02.920]  sixes. So that's why, you know, the quote from the Bible from revelations, let he who have
[2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:08.200]  understanding reckon the number and they say you'll have to have this to buy and sell and it's a
[2:50:08.200 --> 2:50:12.680]  mark in the forehead of the hand. I mean, the Claus Schwab says I want you to have a micro chip
[2:50:12.680 --> 2:50:17.560]  to buy and sell will tell you when you can leave your house when you can't for carbon taxes. Correct.
[2:50:17.560 --> 2:50:23.320]  And then it lists what we're made of is criminal and now they're saying cows are evil. So I'm not
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:28.280]  saying the lethal injection is the mark of the beast, but I'm saying if I was trying to make one
[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:35.720]  these mRNA lethal injections, they permanently mark your DNA forever. Your God-given DNA is altered.
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:39.640]  And they're saying you have to have it to leave your house or buy or sell. It is the mark of the
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:44.920]  beast. I mean, I mean, it is the mark of the beast. And where are the churches on this?
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:49.960]  Well, that's the scary thing about it. Most of the churches are all like, go, you know, do your
[2:50:49.960 --> 2:50:56.520]  part and go get the lethal injection. Well, I think those pastors probably should all resign and let
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:51:02.040]  somebody else take over their church. We've got about eight minutes left to keep laying the knowledge
[2:51:02.040 --> 2:51:11.080]  on a stock. Well, you know, I would say we really want to try give hope and the hope here's where
[2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:17.320]  the hope lies. The hope lies in God. The hope lies in early multiple drug treatment. Not taking do
[2:51:17.320 --> 2:51:22.920]  not take the lethal injections. Do take multiple drug early treatment. We can you can get in touch
[2:51:22.920 --> 2:51:28.360]  with myfreedoctor.com. We can, you know, evaluate your whatever you tell us your health problems
[2:51:28.360 --> 2:51:32.600]  are your medications, your allergies and all that. We can customize what drug we prescribe for you
[2:51:32.600 --> 2:51:37.720]  individually and send them to you for free so that you can have a better chance of description
[2:51:37.720 --> 2:51:44.760]  prescription prescriptions. Yes, sir. And so we have three things that we do. We deliver prescriptions
[2:51:44.760 --> 2:51:50.040]  that are low cost generic, primarily generic beds over the counter recommendations for the
[2:51:50.040 --> 2:51:55.240]  over the counters, which is vitamin C, vitamin D, quercetin, zinc, and a few others. And then the
[2:51:55.240 --> 2:52:00.920]  big thing we do is delivering the hope where we're giving people an easy, free way to communicate
[2:52:00.920 --> 2:52:05.800]  with health care professionals so that we, you know, it gives people help. What happens is across
[2:52:05.800 --> 2:52:09.640]  America, patients get sick with COVID. They call their faulty doctor. Their faulty doctor says,
[2:52:09.640 --> 2:52:14.520]  I'm a coward. Don't come to my office. There's no treatment at all. And if you're dying, go to the
[2:52:14.520 --> 2:52:20.360]  hospital. Well, that's why I call them faulty doctors. 99% of the doctors in America are
[2:52:20.360 --> 2:52:23.880]  sitting on the sidelines in the health care super. And you don't like to want about it,
[2:52:23.880 --> 2:52:27.080]  but they're trying to take your license and others and threatening people that prescribe
[2:52:27.080 --> 2:52:31.160]  too much ivermectin take it. And they're trying to take your website down. Tell me about that.
[2:52:31.160 --> 2:52:38.440]  Correct. Well, they've been battling our platform constantly from day one. Pretty early on,
[2:52:38.440 --> 2:52:42.920]  I had some video conferences with them. I realized they were members of the COVID cold.
[2:52:42.920 --> 2:52:48.280]  And so they, they canceled our malpractice. They've just been obstructing us. They basically
[2:52:48.280 --> 2:52:53.240]  disappearing our patients. And so we're switching platforms and getting off that platform. But
[2:52:53.240 --> 2:52:57.080]  eventually we're going to hope to build our own platform that can't be canceled. That's what
[2:52:57.080 --> 2:53:00.840]  everybody, because I'm imagine you're a medical doctor, accredited, you're saying things that
[2:53:00.840 --> 2:53:05.880]  have studies all behind it, give people completely safe stuff. And they are trying to stop you from
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:10.520]  that. I mean, it's just insane. Correct. And it's mind boggling. All the doctors on our team were
[2:53:10.520 --> 2:53:16.440]  just we're also like, what in the world is going on? How are they doing all these things? They're
[2:53:16.440 --> 2:53:21.480]  sir, we had to spend $5 million, at least just to build the infrastructure, everything,
[2:53:21.480 --> 2:53:25.080]  the backbones, the encoders. We're not allowed to have our own shopping cart. We had to make our
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:30.200]  own codes. We had to build everything. They all would scan our code and then put a news article.
[2:53:30.200 --> 2:53:34.440]  They've got code for this and then take that code away. And so everything we had to build everything.
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:39.560]  Yeah. I mean, I mean, literally that's what this is total attack. Well, I'll tell you,
[2:53:39.560 --> 2:53:43.880]  for the past six months, we've been working with a developer paid him many thousands of dollars
[2:53:43.880 --> 2:53:49.240]  to develop to develop our own servers and own app. And he was supposed to deliver that on August
[2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:53.640]  the 1st, then he backed it up to September 15th and then low and behold a few days before September
[2:53:53.640 --> 2:53:59.640]  15th, he says, I quit and just took our money and said he's not going. Well, that's the that's
[2:53:59.640 --> 2:54:03.000]  what the left does. We learned that the left won't tell you their leftist and they take all
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:06.200]  your money and never deliver anything on purpose. Then they laugh about it. They're criminals.
[2:54:06.200 --> 2:54:10.920]  That's why we finally got patriots and Christian developers and people I'm not the band with two
[2:54:10.920 --> 2:54:14.600]  millions and millions because oh, it's great. We have like five million visitors. People watching
[2:54:14.600 --> 2:54:19.720]  banned on video today. But folks, you know what it cost when when like five million people watch
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:24.040]  an hour long video, a lot of money, even though we've got some of the cheapest bandwidth you can
[2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:30.120]  get. So when you see glitches or problems, folks, we had to build everything. And so that's why
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:33.480]  you're so important in your prayers and everything else, because this is just one hell of a time to
[2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:38.040]  be alive. But we're fighting back. And thanks to God, we just keep making it and keep barely
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:45.400]  hanging on. So we have to keep fighting. And I want to thank you for telling the truth, being
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:49.240]  a true teller and keep keeping up the fight. We got to keep up the good fight. There's a lot of
[2:54:49.240 --> 2:54:54.360]  good patriotic people in America. There's a lot of people that believe in what we're doing. And I
[2:54:54.360 --> 2:54:59.880]  think the masses in general are behind us. It's the problem is the people in power positions
[2:54:59.880 --> 2:55:04.120]  are all members of the COVID cult. Well, absolutely. And before they were hyping it up last year,
[2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:08.120]  I mean, have you not seen a massive, you know, 10 times increase and really people being sick
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:12.360]  this year, the last year? Oh, so many more sick people surprised, surprised since the lethal
[2:55:12.360 --> 2:55:17.160]  injections started. I mean, one of our doctors, he's seen like a 20 fold increase in cancers.
[2:55:17.960 --> 2:55:22.280]  Oh, yeah, Nicki Minaj was actually on to something because the lethal injections do
[2:55:22.280 --> 2:55:26.440]  concentrate in your ovaries and testicles. The people, let's do that next segment,
[2:55:26.440 --> 2:55:29.640]  let's do five more minutes with you on that because I've seen those studies and I want
[2:55:29.640 --> 2:55:33.800]  medical doctor backs up. Nicki Minaj will do a five minute little video on that next segment.
[2:55:33.800 --> 2:55:37.080]  Then I'm gonna have a bunch of stuff after you leave. But this is the question I get if people
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:43.160]  have had the injections, you know, had these these mRNA injections, if it creates the same
[2:55:43.160 --> 2:55:48.200]  spike protein as the regular virus, wouldn't the protocols be the same thing to detox or
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:52.200]  try to mitigate if someone's taken the lethal injection? I would think the whole future is
[2:55:52.200 --> 2:55:57.880]  going to be about finding ways to block that or mitigate it. Well, we're certainly racing to find
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:03.640]  a cure for the lethal injections and I've I've I've thought of a hypothetical cure that we need to
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:10.920]  develop, which is basically the lethal injections go in the use mRNA to alter your your God given
[2:56:10.920 --> 2:56:16.120]  genetic code. So what we can do is if we have a tissue sample from somebody before they got the
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:23.320]  lethal injection, we could theoretically come up with an mRNA product that would restore your
[2:56:23.320 --> 2:56:27.800]  God given genetic code to its state before you got the previous injection, if that makes sense.
[2:56:27.800 --> 2:56:31.880]  Exactly. Use the very same technology to try to reverse reverse engineered. Correct.
[2:56:31.880 --> 2:56:36.360]  And we know from all the studies, it turns off your killer white blood cells. I mean,
[2:56:36.360 --> 2:56:40.440]  they're literally turning our immune system off of this. Correct. And each subsequent shot,
[2:56:40.440 --> 2:56:44.920]  the patients will have higher and higher viral loads. And the theory is that by the second to
[2:56:44.920 --> 2:56:51.080]  third year, after the winter, if you get exposed to Corona, you know, cold season is coronavirus
[2:56:51.080 --> 2:56:56.040]  season. That's what it is. A cold is just a coronavirus. So each time these people who've
[2:56:56.040 --> 2:57:00.840]  already taken the lethal injection, get an infection with it, they're it's almost like the
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:04.440]  lethal injections make you allergic to COVID in the middle of a pandemic. Is that sound like a good
[2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:07.800]  idea to be allergic to COVID in the middle of the COVID pandemic? No. And that's what they admit
[2:57:07.800 --> 2:57:11.720]  it does. And they've got all the different terms and names for it. All right. That was extremely
[2:57:11.720 --> 2:57:15.240]  powerful info. Some stations don't care the first five minutes, we're going to come back.
[2:57:15.240 --> 2:57:21.880]  And it will be archived by this evening at band on video. Doctor, you know, medical doctor says
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:26.520]  Nicki Minaj is cousin is right or something like that or backs up Nicki Minaj. So he's going to
[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:31.160]  do that for five minutes. And then he's going to leave us to be back on the shows tomorrow. And
[2:57:31.160 --> 2:57:34.680]  he's saying he'll come on for a couple hours with Harrison and others. So maybe I'll have you back
[2:57:34.680 --> 2:57:37.960]  just take calls. I got a bunch of guests will tomorrow because I want to be able to call in
[2:57:37.960 --> 2:57:41.560]  and talk to this great guy knows what he's talking about. I will be right back. I got a bunch of
[2:57:41.560 --> 2:57:48.840]  news and Tim pool to the fourth hour. This message is not for our regular listeners who are informed

[3:00:05.240 --> 3:00:11.880]  A few weeks ago, Nicki Minaj came out and she said, Hey, one of my family members friends was
[3:00:11.880 --> 3:00:15.880]  about to get married. He took the COVID shot and his testicles swole up and now he's impotent.
[3:00:15.880 --> 3:00:20.280]  Well, I remember seeing studies that the spike protein that's in it, others attack the heart,
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:25.480]  lungs or get into the brain. It also attacks ovaries, testicles, and then the lining when a
[3:00:25.480 --> 3:00:33.640]  woman is producing the lining that allows her to get pregnant in her uterus. And so I was talking
[3:00:33.640 --> 3:00:40.200]  to Dr. Benjamin Marble MD when he was saying that she's right. So so spend a few minutes talking
[3:00:40.200 --> 3:00:45.800]  about that and what's really going on from the research Dr. Marble. Well, the the lethal injections
[3:00:45.800 --> 3:00:50.040]  have lipid nanoparticles in them. And then when they first came out, they claimed that they would
[3:00:50.040 --> 3:00:54.360]  stay at the local site of injection in your shoulder. But since subsequently we have found that
[3:00:54.360 --> 3:00:59.240]  they're actually distributed to your entire body. And from multiple studies have shown that they
[3:00:59.240 --> 3:01:05.240]  tend to concentrate most in the ovaries and testicles. So that has a tremendous fear for the
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:11.640]  future as far as causing infertility in the people that have taken them. So, you know, if
[3:01:12.440 --> 3:01:18.200]  if the people don't die, like certainly using them in children is just insane, because the children
[3:01:18.200 --> 3:01:24.680]  wouldn't know that they're infertile for 10 15 years later. You know, so Nick, Nicky, it was
[3:01:24.680 --> 3:01:30.040]  interesting the way that transpired, though, because anybody that's a public figure who says
[3:01:30.040 --> 3:01:34.120]  anything against the COVID cold narrative, they're going to get the smackdown. And that's what
[3:01:34.120 --> 3:01:39.800]  happened to Nicki Minaj. They gave her the smackdown. And so it's going to impact her career
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:45.720]  going forward. But she was right. They they have already been proven to concentrate in the testicles.
[3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:50.760]  And I don't know that individual patient as far as you know what exactly happened with him. But
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:56.120]  it is a problem that they concentrate and will cause infertility. What about the general issue
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:01:59.880]  of all these cancer doctors and cancer labs? We played the clips where they go, look, we're seeing
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:05.320]  10 20 30 times increases in the number of people with cancer after they take the shot. I know a
[3:02:05.320 --> 3:02:10.920]  bunch of people took it and got cancer. Correct. We're just the cancer levels. The oncologists,
[3:02:10.920 --> 3:02:15.800]  I know that their cancer rates are just soaring. They're busier than they've ever been. The people
[3:02:15.800 --> 3:02:23.960]  having strokes, heart attacks, myocarditis. Just the list of complications seems endless from these
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:29.000]  from the people that don't die. They have these complications. Of course, a lot of people die.
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:33.720]  So the thing is, is if you design lethal injection to kill in a couple of years,
[3:02:33.720 --> 3:02:37.960]  we're only nine months out from the start of the use of these things. So we've already had 20,000
[3:02:37.960 --> 3:02:42.840]  people die in nine months. Well, what's going to happen going forward? That's the big question
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:47.400]  that remains. And the double prize winner for virology said two to three years. That's what
[3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:52.680]  others said. I guess because it hit mice and rats in three or four, six months, a lot of them died,
[3:02:52.680 --> 3:02:57.560]  most of them died within a year. So I guess they calculated out from rat studies and human studies
[3:02:57.560 --> 3:03:01.320]  that they've done comparisons before that that's the number. I mean, I wonder why they're saying
[3:03:01.320 --> 3:03:05.080]  two to three years. I'm just guessing. Well, it's basically because two to three cold seasons. So
[3:03:05.640 --> 3:03:09.800]  each it's like if you're allergic, like we said earlier, if you're allergic to say
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:14.280]  shrimp and you get exposed to shrimp, you may, you know, break out and a rash or a little bed.
[3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:17.640]  The second time you get exposed is going to be worse. The third, fourth time
[3:03:18.680 --> 3:03:22.520]  gets worse every time so that eventually it's just overwhelming and you die from it. I mean,
[3:03:22.520 --> 3:03:27.080]  I literally saw a patient one time died from eating shrimp. She knew she was allergic. She kept
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:33.560]  eating it. Just like peanuts once you know. So it's a repeat exposure phenomenon. So every cold
[3:03:33.560 --> 3:03:38.120]  season you get you unless you just live like bubble boy, you're going to get every and now
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:41.960]  they're going to make you allergic to the protein that's in all the coronaviruses. It's going to
[3:03:41.960 --> 3:03:46.360]  make everybody basically die like the Spanish flu 1918. Correct. And then when you get the
[3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:50.440]  lethal injection, it makes your body produce the bio weapon, which is the spike protein is the
[3:03:50.440 --> 3:03:54.280]  bio weapon. And then when you're dying, they're going to say, Oh, the unvaccinated killed you
[3:03:54.280 --> 3:03:57.640]  when it's the vaccine that did. And you know, if you get the if you get the lethal injection
[3:03:57.640 --> 3:04:02.680]  and you die within 14 days, they counted as a COVID death, not as a lethal injection death.
[3:04:02.680 --> 3:04:06.440]  Oh, okay. Well, then I wonder why it was killing the rats so much quicker. I guess they're just
[3:04:06.440 --> 3:04:10.200]  not as strong as us. Well, that's the crazy thing that they did the studies in rats. And then
[3:04:10.760 --> 3:04:15.640]  all the animals died. A couple other mammals, they did them in. And basically all the studies,
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:20.040]  the majority of the mammals died. Then a little time passed, they did no human trials. And then
[3:04:20.040 --> 3:04:25.960]  they just decided to start using them in humans. Wow, powerful. I'm going to see if we've got time
[3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:29.800]  to get you back on tomorrow. But I definitely you're going on the other shows. I don't normally
[3:04:29.800 --> 3:04:33.400]  program the other shows for them. But I want this guy, hell, if you want, you can host the whole
[3:04:33.400 --> 3:04:36.840]  three, three hours with Harrison Smith tomorrow. I'm sure he'll want you probably got some guests
[3:04:36.840 --> 3:04:42.120]  on. But Dr. Benjamin Marble, MD, myfreedoctor.com. Good to meet you in person, brother.
[3:04:42.120 --> 3:04:46.280]  There has no place here in the land of the free home of the brave. Don't be afraid.
[3:04:47.240 --> 3:04:51.320]  Absolutely get informed and warn others now that you know the truth. Thank you, doc. We'll be right

[3:06:07.320 --> 3:06:15.160]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:06:15.160 --> 3:06:28.120]  you are the resistance. I guess my feeling at this point in time is maybe we need to
[3:06:29.640 --> 3:06:34.600]  be completely a little bit more scary for the public, especially with the delta variant,
[3:06:34.600 --> 3:06:38.840]  which is the heartiest and most contagious variant we've seen to date. We need all the
[3:06:38.840 --> 3:06:44.200]  protection that we can get. That's why the vaccines are so effective. This is a pandemic of the
[3:06:44.200 --> 3:06:51.000]  unvaccinated. We've got to get them vaccinated and hopefully they will do it willingly. I think we
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:56.200]  really need to make it clear that there are privileges associated with being an American.
[3:06:58.920 --> 3:07:05.160]  If you do not want to get vaccinated, you can work from home. You can homeschool your children.
[3:07:05.160 --> 3:07:10.760]  You can shop online. So where is this coming from? People saying I'm now being forced to be
[3:07:10.760 --> 3:07:15.480]  vaccinated. If you want to travel, you better go get that vaccine. You should be wearing masks
[3:07:15.480 --> 3:07:21.160]  even when you are vaccinated if you are indoors. If you wish to have these privileges,
[3:07:21.160 --> 3:07:25.160]  you need to get vaccinated. We have to say something coming out. You know, you don't get
[3:07:25.160 --> 3:07:42.040]  vaccinated. You know, you can die. I mean, let's just be really blunt to these people. Get vaccinated.
[3:07:55.160 --> 3:08:14.040]  You've always thought you couldn't clear press on nails because of all the active things you do.
[3:08:14.040 --> 3:08:27.560]  We are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness
[3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:36.040]  that resembles sleep. These signals being sent through town. There is a war on for your mind.
[3:08:36.040 --> 3:08:42.120]  Our signal has reached more than two billion people. But the enemy is now aware of the fact
[3:08:42.120 --> 3:08:47.240]  that we've broken through and are moving to block us on every front. The only way you're going to
[3:08:47.240 --> 3:08:52.600]  be able to see our videos and articles is to visit info wars.com itself and hand share the
[3:08:52.600 --> 3:08:57.960]  videos and articles to everyone you know. The signal is getting through and is exposing and
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:09:02.760]  defeating the globalist when we're able to get it through. But they're admittedly expanding
[3:09:02.760 --> 3:09:09.400]  their operations to suppress us so only you can boost the signal. Only you can defeat the globalist.
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:14.440]  We're in this together. I salute you for your work and I ask all of you to redouble your efforts.
[3:09:23.160 --> 3:09:28.680]  A video just went live today on info wars.com and Bandai video. I would like to see it posted
[3:09:28.680 --> 3:09:35.240]  on Twitter, Facebook, everywhere. They live. We sleep. They live. We sleep 2021 COVID edition.
[3:09:35.240 --> 3:09:41.400]  Those are real statements they made. Rob do did a great job adding little. They live faces to it.
[3:09:42.840 --> 3:09:50.680]  My idea. I wanted to take some time out before we have Tim Poole on an in-depth interview coming up
[3:09:53.320 --> 3:09:59.240]  in a few minutes to just talk about sadness, to talk about betrayal, to talk about true evil. We
[3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:06.360]  know that tens of thousands of YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter influencers have been given
[3:10:06.360 --> 3:10:13.800]  on the low end because Biden admits this $2,000 up to $50,000 to say the vaccine is wonderful.
[3:10:13.800 --> 3:10:18.040]  Anybody that doesn't agree with it is insane. No one's gotten sick. Trust the science.
[3:10:18.040 --> 3:10:22.600]  We know some NBA players because some have gone public and exposed the emails have been paid
[3:10:22.600 --> 3:10:26.200]  hundreds of thousands of dollars to lie and say you should take the shots.
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:36.520]  Well, I noticed a video I was sent this morning. It's titled Sam Harris Trashes Brett Weinstein
[3:10:36.520 --> 3:10:42.200]  with Alex Jones comparisons. I'm not going to play the whole thing from the majority report
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:46.680]  commenting on it, but they all do their little NPR,
[3:10:48.200 --> 3:10:53.800]  call the snake voice to put you to sleep and they talk about science and how we don't debate people
[3:10:53.800 --> 3:10:58.840]  about the host of this show and the show they're playing, trying to talk as soft as they can
[3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:04.600]  because that's a trick to show you've got such a IQ. Oh, we don't interview any of these other
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:09.960]  scientists because they're just a husband and wife team and they're just cooks and, you know,
[3:11:09.960 --> 3:11:16.200]  they'll tell you that 14 scientists resigned and it's just a lie. It's made up. Why even respond?
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:21.160]  So they're lying to you talking about why they don't debate people because they lie.
[3:11:21.160 --> 3:11:26.600]  Meanwhile, overhead shot, please, before we play this, I'm just going to show you
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:32.280]  some of what's really going on from the even their own sources. So here's this majority
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:37.400]  report talking about it, their NPR voice. And then here's New York Post article two senior
[3:11:37.400 --> 3:11:43.240]  FDA officials resigned over by demonstration booster shot plan. That's the number one. Number two,
[3:11:43.240 --> 3:11:47.720]  top two vaccine officials resigned from FDA amid political pressure from by administration MSN
[3:11:47.720 --> 3:11:52.040]  to top FDA officials resigned over the Biden administration booster shot plan. And they said,
[3:11:52.040 --> 3:11:56.760]  don't give it to children. And they said that it's probably creating the deadly variants. And
[3:11:56.760 --> 3:12:01.880]  they went on and on and saying Biden's being political. And there's another article out of
[3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:05.480]  Newsmax two FDA officials resigned over Biden's booster plan. It was over more than that. Here's
[3:12:05.480 --> 3:12:11.400]  political FDA panel. So that's the two, then they voted Saturday 16 to two to say don't have boosters.
[3:12:11.400 --> 3:12:18.200]  But these guys don't care. They just say, Oh, it's probably a lie. This is just like the fake
[3:12:18.200 --> 3:12:23.960]  story that ivermectin overfilled the hospitals and that there was the poison control 70% of their
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:30.040]  calls AP had to retract. They all had to it was it wasn't true. Okay. The whole horsepace Oklahoma
[3:12:30.040 --> 3:12:37.320]  story. So that's what's going on. And now Biden says they're just going to override all that.
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:43.960]  Here is FDI advisory panel votes against recommend recommending COVID-19 booster shots for most
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:48.520]  Americans. So notice, they don't show you any facts. They just lie to you and say that's not
[3:12:48.520 --> 3:12:54.040]  going on. Or all the big news that they cooked it up at Wuhan to infect humans created a nanoparticle
[3:12:54.040 --> 3:13:00.200]  to do it. They sit there and talk about how dumb people are. They don't know the science. That's
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:05.640]  a talking point. I don't know. These guys got paid. And everybody else got paid that we know of
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:11.320]  to say these very things. A lot of the shows admit they got paid. So it's very, very evil. So here
[3:13:11.320 --> 3:13:17.720]  is one show using another show and just sitting there with the worst confidence act I've ever seen
[3:13:18.280 --> 3:13:23.720]  laughing at people. So here are these Benedict Arnold's against humanity. Very, very sad people.
[3:13:23.720 --> 3:13:30.120]  Here it is. And we would all learn from the two of you learning from each other. Thank you.
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:39.400]  Hey, Corey. Thanks for the question. Yeah, this is, this is a hard one for me, actually.
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:47.960]  You know, I get that it seems crazy not to just flip on the microphone and talk to the guy
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:55.080]  or talk to him and Heather, who's also been his partner in crime. It's hard to put this in a way
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:14:03.480]  that doesn't sound like a personal attack. But the reason why I don't want to do a podcast
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:11.320]  with Brett and Heather is the same as why I wouldn't do a podcast with a 9-11 Truth Conspiracy
[3:14:11.320 --> 3:14:20.040]  theorist or Alex Jones or anyone in that world. Charles Murray. There's a basic asymmetry
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:26.520]  which is very hard to overcome. It's so much easier to make a mess than to clean it up.
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:33.880]  It's so much easier to light several small fires than to put them out. It's like a 10-1
[3:14:34.440 --> 3:14:40.520]  advantage. To put it that way, it sounds like my concern is not losing a debate and that's
[3:14:40.520 --> 3:14:46.920]  absolutely not my concern. If you're going to view this as a debate, it's won almost immediately.
[3:14:46.920 --> 3:14:53.800]  But I worry about what people take from the encounter and I just don't want to do
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:15:01.400]  additional harm to our public conversation about what is in fact an important public health concern
[3:15:02.360 --> 3:15:08.600]  and a growing political one. First, the asymmetry. The reason why there's such an asymmetry here is
[3:15:08.600 --> 3:15:18.520]  that it is just impossible to debunk most things in real time. And even if the point being made
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:27.640]  is in fact spurious, it won't seem spurious to 99% of an audience. So the person on the conspiracy
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:34.200]  theory side of things can say, well, what about the 14 CDC officials who resigned last week
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:40.840]  and wouldn't give reasons when asked, what do you make of that? Right now, there's probably
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:44.920]  nothing to be made of that, right? I didn't even hear about it. And the truth is, I just made that
[3:15:44.920 --> 3:15:50.680]  up. But when you hear that, he makes it up and then says we're making it up and says he won't
[3:15:50.680 --> 3:15:54.440]  debate people because he's so high and mighty, but he's a liar. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:15:55.400 --> 3:15:59.800]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace

[3:17:56.120 --> 3:18:01.720]  I'll tell you what's life and death. If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right
[3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:07.000]  to be able to communicate, then you don't have a future. Always when governments take away speech,
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:11.000]  they then enslave the population, and then they finally start exterminating the population.
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:15.880]  And America, the entire world, is going down the tubes because the UN Global's directed great
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:20.200]  reset. That's why it's more important than ever that InfoWars stay on the air and that all of us

[3:18:55.000 --> 3:19:03.720]  thank you. The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the
[3:19:03.720 --> 3:19:09.480]  New World Order. And Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well. That means
[3:19:09.480 --> 3:19:15.000]  allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:19.800]  through the UN. And they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want, when they want,
[3:19:19.800 --> 3:19:26.680]  and to have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone
[3:19:26.680 --> 3:19:32.600]  of their new world ID. And now their puppet bite has announced the forced inoculation of 100
[3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:38.920]  million Americans to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code. This is criminal.
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:42.920]  And he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it. They said that's a
[3:19:42.920 --> 3:19:48.440]  20, 25, maybe they just expanded the emergency authorization. That's why the two top scientists
[3:19:48.440 --> 3:19:53.640]  quit a week and a half ago. Well, you live to see an absolute new world order world government.
[3:19:53.640 --> 3:19:55.800]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[3:19:55.800 --> 3:20:07.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:07.320 --> 3:20:28.520]  Well, we're here with Tim Poole is one of the most popular podcasts in the world. He's also had
[3:20:28.520 --> 3:20:34.040]  the courage the last few years to have me on. And he also had the courage to stand up to the heads
[3:20:34.040 --> 3:20:39.400]  of Twitter on Joe Rogan's podcast and ask them serious questions about censorship and their
[3:20:39.400 --> 3:20:42.600]  role in it. And so here we are talking to you for my show. Thanks for talking to us.
[3:20:42.600 --> 3:20:46.040]  Yeah, absolutely. We had you on the show with Michael Malis and I was super excited. It was
[3:20:46.040 --> 3:20:53.480]  a lot of fun. And you didn't do anything wrong. But YouTube took down the episode and it was
[3:20:53.480 --> 3:20:58.040]  actually my fault. I thought you said something you didn't really say. I think that's why they
[3:20:58.040 --> 3:21:00.680]  took it down because I was like, Whoa, Alex, you can't say that because it sounded like you were
[3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:06.680]  saying, you know, you want firing squads when you're actually making a metaphor and not you
[3:21:06.680 --> 3:21:10.280]  weren't calling for violence or anything like that. So I made the mistake. They take the video down.
[3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:19.640]  I got pissed. I immediately called the manager at Google and I was like, we want this up.
[3:21:19.640 --> 3:21:23.640]  I'm not good. You know, I just is not okay. You know, it's if it's a blip in one second,
[3:21:23.640 --> 3:21:28.840]  they were taken out of context. And they said, we can't do it because not only do we not know
[3:21:28.840 --> 3:21:35.480]  know why it was taken down, you know, we can't reinstate a video that, you know, that was in
[3:21:35.480 --> 3:21:41.000]  this way. And so I was like, what if we just snip out the one part, reable the whole thing?
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:44.280]  And they were like, no, because it could have been something else. And I was like, what if we
[3:21:44.280 --> 3:21:48.600]  put up clips individually like we normally do, we don't know which clip would get taken down.
[3:21:48.600 --> 3:21:51.400]  And then I said, I'm going to have Alex Jones back on my show with Michael Mouse. We're going to
[3:21:51.400 --> 3:21:55.480]  do the same thing all over again. And then I hit you guys up. I was like, so we had to wait a week.
[3:21:55.480 --> 3:21:59.720]  And then I was like, come back out. Because I'm not okay with that. You know what I mean?
[3:21:59.720 --> 3:22:02.600]  Well, it's very cough to ask to not tell you what you've done. Right.
[3:22:03.640 --> 3:22:09.160]  So I can only assume it was the firing squad statement when in reality, they wouldn't confirm
[3:22:09.160 --> 3:22:12.760]  to me what happened. And so I was like, you know what, we're going to do it again. If they get us
[3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:17.800]  a strike on this this time, then they shut us down for we can't stream anymore. But I am not
[3:22:17.800 --> 3:22:23.000]  going to sit back. And we did not have a bad conversation. It was totally within their rules.
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:27.080]  You know, we've had other people on the show who have said things 10 times worse than anything
[3:22:27.080 --> 3:22:30.600]  you've been accused of saying that are within the rules, obviously. And YouTube's like,
[3:22:30.600 --> 3:22:34.280]  I don't care about that. It's only because of you. They want to play these games with us. So I
[3:22:34.280 --> 3:22:39.480]  said no to that. You know, I think it's because I talk about the whole eugenics globalist in game.
[3:22:39.480 --> 3:22:44.280]  And now we see more and more and more of that being externalized by them. But simply from that,
[3:22:45.240 --> 3:22:50.360]  are you glad that you moved out of where you were into this beautiful area in the tri-state area?
[3:22:50.360 --> 3:22:56.760]  Yes. Amazing. We get wild wine berries or an apple atcha. So there's these little berries like
[3:22:56.760 --> 3:23:01.800]  raspberries, but they're not a little smaller. They're very sweet. Amazing. We made ice cream with
[3:23:01.800 --> 3:23:07.480]  them. And and so the little berry pods, whatever they're called, they break apart, mix into the
[3:23:07.480 --> 3:23:12.920]  ice cream, but not break open. So you're eating the sweet cream ice cream. And then as you're
[3:23:12.920 --> 3:23:17.480]  eating it, the little wine berries pop in your mouth. It's amazing. The last two times I drove
[3:23:17.480 --> 3:23:21.480]  over here, it was already dark because it was in the winter both times. This time I drove over
[3:23:21.480 --> 3:23:26.760]  here the day. And it's horrible. It's ugly. Don't move near this area. No. There's bears. We had a
[3:23:26.760 --> 3:23:31.080]  copperhead in the back. And so we're doing construction. They're like, they'll run the
[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:35.080]  copperhead. This place is gorgeous. I mean, I was being sarcastic. Because I've been in
[3:23:35.080 --> 3:23:38.440]  Virginia. I've been in Maryland. I've been in West Virginia. But this particular area,
[3:23:38.440 --> 3:23:46.040]  still a secret location, is amazing. Yeah. Secret location. We have Paw Paw. You know,
[3:23:46.040 --> 3:23:50.120]  Paw Paw? Yes. He'll believe bananas. They're everywhere. I thought we only had a couple
[3:23:50.120 --> 3:23:54.040]  trees because apparently they're hard to flower. We walk into the woods on the property and they're
[3:23:54.040 --> 3:23:59.480]  hitting you on the head. It's great. What made you pick this area? We were looking for somewhere
[3:23:59.480 --> 3:24:04.440]  in the middle of nowhere. I've been staying for a long time. So I lived in New York. And then I
[3:24:04.440 --> 3:24:09.400]  lived on Myrtle and Nostrand, about one block from where the black supremacist executed two cops in
[3:24:09.400 --> 3:24:13.800]  the car. And so one day I look out, you know, I look out my window and I see cops everywhere. And
[3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:18.840]  they're down the street, squad car, cops everywhere. Police wouldn't let me leave my own apartment.
[3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:22.680]  I went downstairs. The lights had been shut off. I opened the door and the cops go, you know,
[3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:26.280]  the cop says, get back inside. And I was like, I want to go to the store. And he was like,
[3:24:27.080 --> 3:24:31.320]  crime scene. So I closed the door. The cops walk, you know, they're walking by in patrol.
[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:35.560]  And then I opened the door and I go across the street. You can't lock me in my house.
[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:39.880]  And I walked over to where it was going on. And I'm just seeing the scene. The guy killed
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:44.200]  himself apparently. And then I was just like, you know, I've been watching this happen for the past
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:49.320]  at this, at this point that was, that was, I think 2016 or 2015. I've been watching the escalation
[3:24:49.320 --> 3:24:52.680]  with the protests and the, and the, and the insanity, the algorithmic psychosis, I call it
[3:24:52.680 --> 3:24:56.600]  building up in people. And so I was just, I don't want to be in this place, right? So I moved to
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:25:01.560]  the Jersey side, Jersey city, I moved to Union city in New Jersey, then bombs got planted in
[3:25:01.560 --> 3:25:06.360]  Manhattan on 25th street and in Jersey city. And then I was like, I don't want to be in the
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:12.520]  cities right now because I'm watching the escalation every single day. And so then I'd go to South,
[3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:17.240]  the Southern New York Metro in the Bayone area. And I'm there for a while. And then it's just,
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:21.720]  there was no cataclysm moment there other than the ongoing escalation where I said,
[3:25:22.520 --> 3:25:26.120]  let's, let's go to South Jersey. For one, I want to buy my own house. I want to have my own
[3:25:26.120 --> 3:25:31.080]  production city not rent and actually be able to expand and better property, better prices,
[3:25:31.080 --> 3:25:35.000]  and across the river on the other side of Philly. So it's not New York. It's,
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:38.680]  it's not going to be as crazy plus we're on the Jersey side when I've got to worry about it.
[3:25:38.680 --> 3:25:43.640]  And then the riots happened with George Floyd, right? And I thought we were safe until one day
[3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:48.040]  I heard the sirens and squad cars, the riders crossed the bridge into Jersey. And so then I'm
[3:25:48.040 --> 3:25:51.960]  thinking to myself, I don't believe they'll come to my house. I don't think they're going to come
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:57.240]  to my neighborhood. They're coming to some neighborhoods. But at a certain point, I don't
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:26:02.440]  want to support the areas that are letting this lawlessness persist that are bowing down to this.
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:07.480]  When you see the police get on the knee for the protesters and I'm thinking, you know what,
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:13.080]  I'll get more space for cheaper. We can do more fun stuff. We can fly zeppelins and drones and we
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:18.760]  can just watch your cars parked in the grass, fresh fruit, grow on crops, have chickens,
[3:26:19.560 --> 3:26:25.000]  start looking for a place in the middle of nowhere. And this is close enough to DC
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:29.640]  to where we can fly people in and have guests out of chosen Wyoming or Montana,
[3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:31.560]  if it was possible, but you can't get people to fly out there.
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:36.520]  No, but you're right. This is as close to living out in the middle of the forest in a beautiful
[3:26:36.520 --> 3:26:39.800]  area with mountains and everything else, but still being close to a big city. It's just amazing.
[3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:44.360]  It's a smart move. And it seems like I came here pretty early in lockdown to visit you.
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:48.200]  You'd already moved before that even happened or just doing it during it.
[3:26:48.200 --> 3:26:53.160]  We left here, I think, we started preparing our move in August. And it's like the lockdowns
[3:26:53.160 --> 3:26:56.600]  happened, 15 days still to spread all the stuff and things were getting progressively worse.
[3:26:56.600 --> 3:27:02.600]  And then eventually we were like, before it gets substantially worse, we should find a place,
[3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:03.800]  not to mention we want to expand.
[3:27:03.800 --> 3:27:06.920]  Well, you were smart to do that. Why do you think the establishment globally,
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:10.520]  because obviously globalism is about corporate rule over the planet,
[3:27:10.520 --> 3:27:15.960]  teaching us to live under martial law, to be non-essential, and all of the world,
[3:27:15.960 --> 3:27:18.440]  they're only tightening down, they're getting ready to tighten down here again.
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:21.800]  Why do you think the ruling class would want to create such a dystopic system?
[3:27:21.800 --> 3:27:27.880]  Oh, you know, I'm not entirely convinced that there's like a group of people sitting around
[3:27:27.880 --> 3:27:32.680]  towing their mustaches, believing like, this is our latest plan. I know this is the Davos group.
[3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:39.320]  I know they do have plans, but I think it's more of emerging systems and basically that
[3:27:40.600 --> 3:27:45.480]  pressures beget pressures beget pressures. So when something happens, it'll naturally give rise to
[3:27:45.480 --> 3:27:49.800]  a certain group, which will naturally give rise to certain groups. So you do have people intent
[3:27:49.800 --> 3:27:54.760]  on making dramatic changes. You do have people like Bill Gates who come out on TED Talk saying,
[3:27:54.760 --> 3:28:00.600]  we've got a population problem. And then what ends up happening is, independent of Bill Gates,
[3:28:00.600 --> 3:28:04.760]  you'll get some people in some group in Europe, they'll agree with each other,
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:07.080]  they'll both implement some kind of plan in a certain direction.
[3:28:08.120 --> 3:28:12.360]  I don't think they want a dystopia. I just don't think they actually know what they're doing,
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:16.040]  don't have nearly as much control as they think they do, or many people think they do.
[3:28:16.040 --> 3:28:20.040]  So what ends up happening is, they just start a fire, they can't control, and then...
[3:28:20.040 --> 3:28:24.040]  Well, sure. There's kind of like extinction rebellion, blocking blue-collar people going
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:28.920]  to work on trains or highways while a woman's having a baby and a man's having a heart attack.
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:33.880]  I mean, to them, they see humans destroying things. So it's a very simple solution. Let's just block
[3:28:33.880 --> 3:28:38.120]  humans and shut down industrial society. Will you do that with all these billions of people
[3:28:38.120 --> 3:28:42.120]  that will cause giant wars and death and basically the equivalent of a zombie apocalypse?
[3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:46.280]  And so they're pushing everything into a, quote, control collapse in their words.
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:50.200]  And that's what Klaus Schwab has said. They want a great reset and shutting things down was good
[3:28:50.200 --> 3:28:54.520]  for the earth, but really all it caused was mass starvation that'll then flood us with their world
[3:28:54.520 --> 3:28:59.880]  populace. You know, listeners call into the cell when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:29:00.600 --> 3:29:06.200]  because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:29:06.840 --> 3:29:11.800]  and for word of mouth, and we're all this together. And it gets old having to come to you and say,
[3:29:11.800 --> 3:29:15.960]  hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air. But it's true for the only
[3:29:15.960 --> 3:29:20.520]  media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden
[3:29:20.520 --> 3:29:24.680]  to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled
[3:29:24.680 --> 3:29:29.960]  all the other groups and we're still here. And as this whole new world order comes out and be open,
[3:29:29.960 --> 3:29:33.960]  our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America
[3:29:33.960 --> 3:29:38.040]  has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still
[3:29:38.040 --> 3:29:43.160]  quasi free. You can't have info wars has been proven right, be on air with all the craziness
[3:29:43.160 --> 3:29:47.800]  that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all
[3:29:47.800 --> 3:29:52.680]  and get an info wars store.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more.
[3:29:52.680 --> 3:29:54.760]  They're wonderful products and they support the info. We're thank you.
[3:29:57.400 --> 3:30:03.400]  General Lee, it's General Milley. I just want you to know that Trump tried to overthrow the U.S.
[3:30:03.400 --> 3:30:08.520]  government two days ago on January 6. And I just want you to know I've taken control of the nuclear
[3:30:08.520 --> 3:30:13.000]  weapons and if Trump tries to launch an attack on you, we'll let you know first the attacks coming.
[3:30:14.040 --> 3:30:20.280]  That is from the transcript. Then he called up Pelosi, Schumer and others to say, I'm loyal to
[3:30:20.280 --> 3:30:24.680]  you. I'm going to protect Trump from using nuclear weapons. But Trump was going for detente with
[3:30:24.680 --> 3:30:29.320]  China and North Korea at the time and Trump's responded saying it's a total lie. Pelosi's come
[3:30:29.320 --> 3:30:34.760]  out and admitted it happened. Pelosi bragged back on January 8 that it took place then and is saying
[3:30:34.760 --> 3:30:39.320]  that she honors Milley and that he's this courageous person. So are all these other Democrats.
[3:30:39.320 --> 3:30:43.880]  So this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming out
[3:30:43.880 --> 3:30:48.840]  of the shadows publicly. Remember, these people literally hate you and your family. Now they're
[3:30:48.840 --> 3:30:56.760]  injecting you with poison soft kill injections. Wake up America or be destroyed. Let's go back
[3:30:56.760 --> 3:31:02.360]  in time. Save the mid 1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020
[3:31:02.920 --> 3:31:07.800]  where a world government's being established where members of Congress and former presidents are
[3:31:07.800 --> 3:31:13.560]  censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood plots
[3:31:13.560 --> 3:31:20.360]  and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane. Think about that
[3:31:20.360 --> 3:31:26.200]  because that's where we are. Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody
[3:31:26.200 --> 3:31:32.200]  told you this would be happening, but it is happening now. And then they tell you, oh, sorry,
[3:31:32.200 --> 3:31:37.320]  it's not a vaccine as a gene therapy and it doesn't really work. She got to take it every few months.
[3:31:37.320 --> 3:31:42.040]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside
[3:31:42.040 --> 3:31:46.440]  and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID. And now there's record numbers
[3:31:46.440 --> 3:31:51.240]  of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus. And that's in mainline
[3:31:51.240 --> 3:31:57.080]  studies. Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now. We're already halfway
[3:31:57.080 --> 3:32:04.120]  through September 2021. It's just incredible. And now the world is waking up that info wars
[3:32:04.120 --> 3:32:08.120]  was the tip of the spear and was dead on. That's why it's more important than ever to keep us on
[3:32:08.120 --> 3:32:12.680]  air. And I thank you all for your support, your prayers and your word of mouth that is key to

[3:32:59.640 --> 3:33:02.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:02.280 --> 3:33:15.000]  It didn't flood us with third world populations and I see
[3:33:15.000 --> 3:33:19.720]  totally stabilization coming, but that's my view. Gut level, where do you think humanity is going
[3:33:19.720 --> 3:33:23.320]  the next year, the next two years, the next five years? If you had to make a prediction,
[3:33:23.960 --> 3:33:27.640]  would you say a much more destabilized English world? Where do you see the world getting better?
[3:33:27.640 --> 3:33:37.480]  Well, to find better, I suppose. Let's talk about the great reset and what they've been doing.
[3:33:37.480 --> 3:33:44.520]  You will own nothing and you will be happy. Not better in that regard, but I've often
[3:33:44.520 --> 3:33:48.600]  wondered a few questions for conservatives defending cops when they're accused of racism.
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:52.520]  I'm like, these leftist progressives are talking about New York City. You call the
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:56.280]  progressives racist and then are surprised and disagree with them when they say the city is
[3:33:56.280 --> 3:34:04.840]  racist. I shouldn't even say pro-abortion. The accusation from a lot of people on the right
[3:34:04.840 --> 3:34:09.960]  is that it's a depopulation movement. I don't know if I'll go that far. I just don't know enough
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:14.360]  about it. I certainly think there are people who are pro-terminating babies and not having kids and
[3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:17.000]  they say it's good for the environment. When you hear that, you're like, well, those people
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:20.680]  certainly don't want kids. Then you just ask yourself, who's not having the kids? I mean,
[3:34:20.680 --> 3:34:24.360]  conservatives are certainly having kids. The progressives and leftists are the ones advocating
[3:34:24.360 --> 3:34:29.560]  for you not to have kids. So what happens in 10, 20 years? If you go back to 20, I think it was the
[3:34:29.560 --> 3:34:33.960]  early 2000s. There was a study they did where they found that conservatives were having on average
[3:34:33.960 --> 3:34:40.600]  2.01 children and progressives were having 1.73 children below replacement levels. Now you take
[3:34:40.600 --> 3:34:46.440]  a look at the Pew research on the political views of the generations and you can see that Gen Z
[3:34:46.440 --> 3:34:52.360]  is slightly more conservative than millennials in some areas, but about as progressive relative
[3:34:52.360 --> 3:34:57.240]  to Gen X. Why is it that Gen Z is in some areas slightly more conservative? Well, a lot of people
[3:34:57.240 --> 3:35:01.400]  have said it's because the young generations on the internet, they're based, they're getting access
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:05.320]  to real information. I think the reality is that 20 years ago when we saw this study,
[3:35:05.320 --> 3:35:09.800]  conservatives had kids and liberals didn't. What happens in 20 years? You get more people
[3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:14.440]  voting conservative and less people voting for progressive policies. You do have the millennials
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:19.240]  driving a lot of the cancel culture, wrote Miss Psychosis, but I've got to wonder, if there was
[3:35:19.240 --> 3:35:23.400]  a, I can't remember who said this, it might have been Glenn Beck years and years ago, that if you've
[3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:30.840]  got people who are advocating for abortion, literally ending their own bloodlines, then the
[3:35:30.840 --> 3:35:35.080]  natural outcome is going to be a very conservative religious future where you can see religious
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:40.760]  families having seven kids and opposing abortion. So the future, I mean, is the population going
[3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:44.120]  to be smaller? Probably, it's going to cause economic problems in a lot of ways. We're going
[3:35:44.120 --> 3:35:47.880]  to see manipulation in the media so people don't realize what's happening, but then if that's the
[3:35:47.880 --> 3:35:51.880]  path, I think there's a simple equation, which may be wrong, that the future will be substantially
[3:35:51.880 --> 3:35:57.480]  more libertarian conservative and less. Well, I think that is where the future is naturally going,
[3:35:57.480 --> 3:36:02.680]  and that's where globalism and the Davos group is coming in their own words to block that. But
[3:36:02.680 --> 3:36:08.440]  if you pull back from it, that's why you see this move to get first world nations, whether it's
[3:36:08.440 --> 3:36:14.360]  Japan or the United States, to not have children, whereas you need about 2.1 replacement rate and
[3:36:14.360 --> 3:36:18.920]  all the studies to be able to even take care of the old people. And the idea of Klaus Schwabbo
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:23.880]  robots will do it. That's not really going to happen. And so that's why a lot of the actuaries
[3:36:23.880 --> 3:36:28.920]  show a dystopic future because you have all these giant third world populations who are coming in,
[3:36:28.920 --> 3:36:33.800]  right as we get rid of the middle class. And so instead of lifting them up, you're going to have
[3:36:33.800 --> 3:36:38.280]  just even larger groups of poor people who are having more children. And so it's almost like the
[3:36:38.280 --> 3:36:42.600]  globalist model is making that worse. Instead of industrializing those people and bringing them up,
[3:36:42.600 --> 3:36:48.680]  then they would have less than two children. It's tough. We had, who was it? I think it was
[3:36:48.680 --> 3:36:52.840]  Chris Martinson. Are you familiar with Dr. Chris Martinson? I've heard the name. He talked about
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:57.880]  the, what was it called, the windshield phenomenon? Have you ever heard that? I have. That's scary,
[3:36:58.440 --> 3:37:03.080]  right? Tell folks about the windshield phenomenon. People have noticed a decline in, when you're
[3:37:03.080 --> 3:37:07.480]  driving down the road, how many bugs splatter on your windshield. And so there was actually a study
[3:37:07.480 --> 3:37:12.440]  done in Denmark where they found, you know, they drove a car, calculated how many bugs hit the
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:17.240]  windshield over like a thousand cars or whatever. Then they did it progressively over time and found
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:22.760]  the amount of bugs was on the decline. They're plunging and bees as well. I mean, just one
[3:37:22.760 --> 3:37:28.840]  quarter of a second. So it sounds like something bad's happening, right? I mean, I agree because
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:33.000]  you have the birds and the bats that eat the bugs and then they're the ones that, you know, help
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:37.560]  pollinate everything, the bees. And I remember driving to our ranch, we had a family property
[3:37:37.560 --> 3:37:42.600]  in East Texas. And until about 20 years ago, it didn't matter if it was the fall, the summer,
[3:37:42.600 --> 3:37:47.320]  the spring, you would have covered bugs all over the front and covered bugs all over the windshield.
[3:37:47.320 --> 3:37:53.000]  Not anymore. And now, I mean, there might be five dead bugs when I drive 200 miles.
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:58.760]  Yep. And so yeah, there is. The same thing. So I have to wonder, is there really a population
[3:37:58.760 --> 3:38:03.960]  problem? Are humans, you know, look, you put yeast in a bottle, eventually it farts itself to death.
[3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:08.200]  And so is this something I actually asked you on? Well, that's the population bomb deal of Paul
[3:38:08.200 --> 3:38:13.480]  Erlich. And then that's where from that model of the voluntary extinction society and groups that
[3:38:13.480 --> 3:38:17.880]  say they've been sterilized, not going to have children. And I think it has to do with electromagnetics.
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:23.080]  I think it has to do with pesticides. I think it has to do with some over farming of soils. There's
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:27.800]  ways to transcend all that. I mean, I think just saying humans, I mean, obviously a lot of parts
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:31.640]  of the world are overpopulated, like India, areas of China go to the Caribbean, and then there's
[3:38:31.640 --> 3:38:35.160]  a million people on one island or whatever. Obviously, those people need to be educated,
[3:38:35.160 --> 3:38:40.680]  formed, and then become middle class, and then they have less than two children. I mean,
[3:38:40.680 --> 3:38:45.320]  so I think we can fix the population problem we have. Undoubtedly, the world is overpopulated,
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:49.880]  in my view. I just don't think that you sit there and then give this super class the total
[3:38:49.880 --> 3:38:54.520]  control of everybody, because when you say the super class, they are beyond the Nazis. I mean,
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:38:58.040]  if you look at the Rockefellers setting up the UN, they actually funded Hitler, the Kaiser
[3:38:58.040 --> 3:39:03.080]  Ville Institute. All that elitism is, they say, oh, we don't dislike people for what color scheme
[3:39:03.080 --> 3:39:07.880]  they are. Everybody with low test scores needs to die. They hate people. They hate people. And then,
[3:39:07.880 --> 3:39:12.920]  again, they're so stagnant and so unhappy, and they don't have a right to decide all that.
[3:39:12.920 --> 3:39:19.640]  And so they're a very, very great danger. You know, I can ponder difficult questions.
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:23.640]  You know, when you mention the Rothschilds, the UN stuff, I don't know anything about that.
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:27.080]  What I can say is something I've been thinking about since the beginning of the pandemic,
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:30.760]  when you get a lot of conspiracies about the Great Reset and stuff. Certainly, they've said the
[3:39:30.760 --> 3:39:34.920]  Great Reset is real. Certainly, the Davos group, the World Economic Forum, has said,
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:39.480]  which COVID restrictions would you like to be permanent? Or I think they said, which changes?
[3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:44.680]  They said restrictions, right? And they've said it's good for the earth to have periodic lockdowns.
[3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:48.680]  And it's like Obama going to Africans and you can't have cars or air conditioning. But he lives,
[3:39:48.680 --> 3:39:53.480]  and he bought a giant mansion on the ocean. But it's saying the water is going to go up. See,
[3:39:53.480 --> 3:39:58.120]  they're telling us the world ends in 2030, because under a June of 2030, the world as we know it
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:02.360]  ends. So they're preparing us for calamities, and they're saying, oh, it's the environment when
[3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:06.920]  they're going to introduce the things that a global lockdown makes us poor here. It stars
[3:40:06.920 --> 3:40:10.600]  people to death by the hundreds of millions that you know, in estimation. Right. Yeah, 225 million,
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:14.600]  I think they said last year. Yeah, it's correct. Well, on the edge of death, like 20 million extra
[3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:19.160]  died. Yeah. Let me ask you a question. So again, people might can take this out of con. I'm literally
[3:40:19.160 --> 3:40:25.000]  just trying to ponder these tough questions. If there really was this effort to wipe out the low
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:30.120]  IQs and all that stuff, I look at these people who I describe as being an occult, they believe
[3:40:30.120 --> 3:40:35.560]  whatever's on the TV, they don't do any independent research. CNN, actually, there's an article about
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:40.120]  not doing research saying don't do research. I'm not kidding. I tweeted it out. I'm even the new
[3:40:40.120 --> 3:40:44.760]  I read it from your tweet. Even the New York Times had an article about it's dangerous to do research.
[3:40:44.760 --> 3:40:51.880]  So if you were a desperate who wanted to cleanse humanity and only the intelligent
[3:40:51.880 --> 3:40:57.080]  people would would would would carry on, which group would that be? The people who believe
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:41:00.520]  whatever they're told and don't investigate or the critical thinkers challenging the system?
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:04.440]  And that's what they release a lot of that's very that's what we should have done on your
[3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:11.000]  show is that's huge. It's like a psychological test or an IQ test. You know, can you really
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:14.680]  research this in a vaccine? Can you really find out? It doesn't help you. Can you really find
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:19.000]  out you're being lied to in BS? And it's really a test to then let people who are dumbed down
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:23.080]  opt into it. And the people that are smart opt out it. And a lot of people go, oh, that's great.
[3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:27.480]  All the dumb people, the leftists aren't having children. They're taking all the dangerous shots.
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:30.600]  And then it's very sick because we're actually now becoming like the eugenicists that are doing
[3:41:30.600 --> 3:41:34.520]  this. And they're saying, see, we're so smart. We figured this out. You ought to join us.
[3:41:35.400 --> 3:41:39.560]  PhDs are the most vaccine hesitant. Absolutely not. We're highly educated.
[3:41:39.560 --> 3:41:43.640]  The head of Pfizer said he won't take it. He did take it. Oh, yeah, he did. Yeah. So in,
[3:41:43.640 --> 3:41:47.960]  in, I think in March, he said he's not going to jump the line. He got criticized two weeks later.
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:51.960]  He now see he got the vaccine. Yeah. So I don't see that, but I believe it. Right. Right. And we
[3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:56.280]  can fact check it. Hey, I love your new green room. That's great. Right. I mean, you've got an
[3:41:56.280 --> 3:42:00.920]  actual green room, but this is awesome out here. It's a green. It's the green outside. Hey, let's
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:05.000]  just, what are we talking about on your show tonight? People will watch this on my show in a
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:08.040]  few days. Most of my viewers are already fans that probably would have already watched it,
[3:42:08.040 --> 3:42:11.960]  but for those that haven't, what are we planning to cover tonight? Topical events, stuff that's
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:16.680]  been going on today. So obviously there's stuff going on with China. There's vaccine mandates.
[3:42:18.280 --> 3:42:21.960]  I have to pull up all the articles we have on, there's a, there's a, there's a lot of stories.
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:25.320]  But we should talk about, because this is something I'm, I'm not as hyper out of control
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:29.000]  today. I've stopped drinking and stuff and I've been, you know, exercising more and trying to
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:32.440]  get more focused because a lot of times I get tired. So I get lazy and I just kind of rant
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:35.880]  that fun because it's easy to do, but to be focused as free rules are, but I'm going to do it
[3:42:35.880 --> 3:42:39.640]  tonight. Uh, I mean, I'd like to get into all that stuff about the windshield phenomenon,
[3:42:39.640 --> 3:42:44.360]  uh, the, you know, the, the, the whole petri dish for the population bomb. We should do all that.
[3:42:44.360 --> 3:42:46.360]  What else are you going to cover?
[3:42:46.360 --> 3:43:01.560]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:09.800]  Yes.
[3:43:09.800 --> 3:43:22.520]  Info wars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[3:43:22.520 --> 3:43:33.080]  The great awakening is here. Go to band.video download the videos and share support the
[3:43:33.080 --> 3:43:41.480]  information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[3:43:41.480 --> 3:44:10.760]  The big takeaway here is that he didn't act alone. He felt that he was safe to talk.
[3:44:11.800 --> 3:44:16.280]  Overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched by not just our government,
[3:44:16.280 --> 3:44:21.320]  the five eyes, the Russians and the Chinese. He wanted the world to know that he was proud
[3:44:21.320 --> 3:44:26.120]  of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state. This permanent bureaucracy sees
[3:44:26.120 --> 3:44:31.960]  America as its enemy. It sees the American people as his enemy. It sees prosperity as its enemy.
[3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:36.600]  And it conspired with the communist Chinese to threaten them basically and say, Trump may
[3:44:36.600 --> 3:44:42.040]  nuke you, but if he tries, we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first.
[3:44:42.040 --> 3:44:47.000]  That's beyond treason. But it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their own
[3:44:47.000 --> 3:44:51.320]  fetid bubble. They try to get away with this. Millie and all of his accomplices need to go
[3:44:51.320 --> 3:44:59.960]  to prison now for life. Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water,
[3:44:59.960 --> 3:45:04.280]  soil and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions

[3:46:00.040 --> 3:46:05.240]  of speech, if you don't have the right to be able to communicate, then you don't have a future.
[3:46:05.240 --> 3:46:09.480]  Always when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population and then they finally
[3:46:09.480 --> 3:46:14.040]  start exterminating the population. And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because
[3:46:14.040 --> 3:46:18.920]  the UN Global's directed great reset. That's why it's more important than ever that info or stay

[3:46:55.480 --> 3:47:15.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:15.480 --> 3:47:22.920]  The United Republic is gone. And there's one metric. You can say it's hard to know where the
[3:47:22.920 --> 3:47:26.920]  line is when you can say the country doesn't exist anymore. I think we've seen it now. I can
[3:47:26.920 --> 3:47:34.840]  say a few things. Joe Biden has bypassed the separation of powers. I believe now what is this
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:39.880]  three times with the eviction moratorium bypassing Congress, the Supreme Court saying stop him saying
[3:47:39.880 --> 3:47:44.920]  no, I'll do it again. And then finally him coming out the vaccine mandates just saying I rule by
[3:47:44.920 --> 3:47:49.400]  decree. Now think about how the laws are supposed to be formed in this country. You've got the
[3:47:49.400 --> 3:47:55.000]  legislature, the House drafts a bill, goes to Senate, Senate approves, President signs it,
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:59.160]  executive branch can get back, it passes, the Supreme can be challenged in the courts.
[3:47:59.160 --> 3:48:03.880]  Now we are just in a system where the sovereign hereby decrees and already people are being
[3:48:03.880 --> 3:48:08.280]  fired for not getting their vaccine at big companies. And he's very good at turning groups
[3:48:08.280 --> 3:48:13.640]  against each other. But what can you do when the sovereign decrees? Well peasant, you can petition
[3:48:13.640 --> 3:48:18.040]  your wise elders and if they feel you've been wronged, they will hear what you have to say
[3:48:18.040 --> 3:48:22.680]  or dismiss you outright. There is no ridgess of grievances anymore. Democrats tried to create a
[3:48:22.680 --> 3:48:29.400]  path of citizenship through a spending bill which bypasses our quorum effectively. We're at a point
[3:48:29.400 --> 3:48:33.640]  in this country where no one cares about the system of government that was set up by the founding
[3:48:33.640 --> 3:48:40.040]  fathers to our traditions or our laws. But those right there, I can still argue, well Obama killed
[3:48:40.040 --> 3:48:44.840]  American citizens, you can argue, no, no, there's one simple thing. On the southern border of Texas,
[3:48:44.840 --> 3:48:49.560]  illegal immigrants are going back and forth. Now it's one thing when you have illegal immigrants
[3:48:49.560 --> 3:48:53.640]  cross into your country and you say, hey there mister, that's a violation of the law, we're
[3:48:53.640 --> 3:48:57.320]  going to take you, we're going to process you. And then if you're an asylum seeker, we'll consider
[3:48:57.320 --> 3:49:01.080]  it. We're actually really nice in that regard. We could do what Trump did, have him come to the
[3:49:01.080 --> 3:49:05.400]  border and request formally and wait in Mexico. But even in the U.S., we're like, we'll try to be
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:10.920]  nice. Now we have the migrants leaving, buying food and coming back. When you're at a point where
[3:49:10.920 --> 3:49:15.800]  you have, was it 15,000 people? It's more than that now. More than that. And they're crossing
[3:49:15.800 --> 3:49:19.480]  the border as if nothing is there at all. Don't revolve in door. Do you see the videos of them
[3:49:19.480 --> 3:49:25.720]  carrying takeout? Yes. They're illegally entering the country, then going back to Mexico for takeout
[3:49:25.720 --> 3:49:31.080]  and coming back. When your border is that, there's no border, there's no jurisdiction,
[3:49:31.080 --> 3:49:35.000]  you have no control over these people, and you combine that with everything else we've seen,
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:39.320]  the republic is, I totally agree. So we should talk about that tonight and talk about ways to
[3:49:39.320 --> 3:49:43.960]  reverse it. Because I will say, okay, letting me a dictator, Julius Caesar, but then all the other
[3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:47.160]  checks and balances go out the door, and that's what allowed us to have more wealth in the other
[3:49:47.160 --> 3:49:51.800]  country in the world, was the checks and balances that allowed a middle class to form. And unfortunately,
[3:49:51.800 --> 3:49:56.840]  the globals don't want that around. So, Tim Poole, tell the viewers of M4s that don't follow your
[3:49:56.840 --> 3:50:03.240]  show how people find it. Timcast.com. Timcast.com. Yes, see, we, I cut down my YouTube production
[3:50:03.240 --> 3:50:08.440]  in half at the beginning of the year because YouTube is bad, censoring. And we set up Timcast.com
[3:50:08.440 --> 3:50:12.360]  where we're hiring journalists where we're, you know, so we'll do the live show tonight on YouTube,
[3:50:12.360 --> 3:50:17.560]  right? And YouTube has rules about the things you can't do or say. Some of them, I think,
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:21.320]  absolutely cross the line. Some of them are stupid. And then we have our rules, like, we don't want
[3:50:21.320 --> 3:50:24.280]  to swear, you know, we try to be something that people can listen to with their families. Don't
[3:50:24.280 --> 3:50:29.080]  want to threaten people. Yeah, no violence, something like that. But some of their restrictions
[3:50:29.080 --> 3:50:33.960]  are absolutely ridiculous. So I'm not going to dedicate, it's a mistake to build a business on
[3:50:33.960 --> 3:50:39.320]  YouTube. But it's still good marketing. With Timcast.com, you, me, Phil, we can do a show
[3:50:40.040 --> 3:50:43.000]  where we can talk about whatever we want without being censored. I'll look forward to that. You
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:48.920]  have Bandod video. I love, you know what I really love when these journalists, I do air quotes,
[3:50:48.920 --> 3:50:53.000]  come out and said, aha, we banned Alex Jones and now he's gone. And I'm like, no, now you just
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:56.520]  don't see him. He made his own YouTube. His videos are getting hundreds of thousands of views.
[3:50:57.080 --> 3:51:02.200]  Certainly it affected your reach for sure by doing it. But it did make the fans more hard
[3:51:02.200 --> 3:51:07.320]  corn away. It was rough, you know, for a few years, but in a way it has made us bigger and
[3:51:07.320 --> 3:51:10.920]  stronger. And that's what everybody's doing now. It's great. Like Joe Rogan, you know,
[3:51:10.920 --> 3:51:14.440]  you Spotify, that's like his, you know, bigger private thing, but it's also giant. And boy,
[3:51:14.440 --> 3:51:19.880]  you know, Joe, you know, moved out of California. Last question, we got to go to your show.
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:26.120]  Where do you think this Exodus ends when the blue cities are all collapsing and all the brain
[3:51:26.120 --> 3:51:30.840]  trust is leaving either, you know, go to the woods or go to the mountains or go to the plains or,
[3:51:30.840 --> 3:51:35.320]  you know, go to Austin, Texas? I mean, what are they going to do as they drive out everybody?
[3:51:35.320 --> 3:51:40.520]  I don't know why they're doing it. It depends on how gradually then suddenly it all happens,
[3:51:40.520 --> 3:51:44.200]  right? If it's something that's slow and over time, people just slowly start moving out to the
[3:51:44.200 --> 3:51:48.200]  middle of nowhere and spreading out, which I actually think is a good thing. Healthy. If it
[3:51:48.200 --> 3:51:53.720]  happens really, really quickly, I mean, people can't just leave. You can't just, you live in New
[3:51:53.720 --> 3:51:57.560]  York, you can't just take your family, just walk somewhere else. They're going to be beating each
[3:51:57.560 --> 3:52:01.480]  other in the streets. Depending on how bad it gets, people will be eating each other.
[3:52:01.480 --> 3:52:06.360]  I agree. And when you bring in a third world population to replace the educated and former
[3:52:06.360 --> 3:52:10.120]  people of all races that were there, when that knowledge class leaves, it's going to collapse.
[3:52:10.120 --> 3:52:13.960]  How are they going to get the bubbles of the, of the houses so expensive? And I couldn't live
[3:52:13.960 --> 3:52:19.640]  in New York. We've got 27 employees, about maybe 30. And we're growing and we're expanding. And
[3:52:19.640 --> 3:52:23.880]  we're looking to invest in new businesses beyond just news and politics. We're doing culture stuff.
[3:52:23.880 --> 3:52:28.760]  We do the Castigasso vlog, which is very hokey and silly. That could have been in New Jersey.
[3:52:28.760 --> 3:52:33.160]  We were trying to buy a building in New Jersey and it was too difficult. The taxes were insane.
[3:52:33.160 --> 3:52:38.280]  And ultimately with the restrictions, I said, what's the point of being here? So I actually thought,
[3:52:39.560 --> 3:52:43.480]  you know, New Jersey's got a millennial brain drain. No millennial that's grown up in New
[3:52:43.480 --> 3:52:47.960]  Jersey wants to be there. And I said, I know it's got its problems. I know it's got bad taxes,
[3:52:47.960 --> 3:52:52.280]  but I think we can make something good and try and bring this back. We can stand here,
[3:52:52.280 --> 3:52:58.200]  stand our ground and breed a culture that votes better and improves. And it was so
[3:52:59.160 --> 3:53:02.920]  just over encumbering that I was just like, this is pointless. West Virginia.
[3:53:03.480 --> 3:53:09.880]  And what about your native Chicago? Oh, yeah, right. I don't like a shot. I've looked at,
[3:53:09.880 --> 3:53:15.320]  I've looked at properties in Chicago. Taxes are ridiculous. Economy is not, not great.
[3:53:15.320 --> 3:53:19.320]  Space is not there. Cities are bad for more, more than just the culture or stuff.
[3:53:19.320 --> 3:53:24.040]  I mean, I agree. And the cities are dying, not just here, but all over the world. People
[3:53:24.040 --> 3:53:28.520]  really want to decentralize. So who knows, maybe I'm going to become a neighbor because, look,
[3:53:28.520 --> 3:53:32.440]  Austin's great. And my family's been there for hundreds of years. But the whole point is,
[3:53:32.440 --> 3:53:37.880]  is this becomes a new LA. I'm definitely looking, I've just got a big crew and they live in Austin.
[3:53:37.880 --> 3:53:41.320]  And I love Joe's there and everybody else here. I'm probably still trying to keep a condo there
[3:53:41.320 --> 3:53:45.400]  or something or a shack outside town, but I just gut level want to move to the woods.
[3:53:45.400 --> 3:53:51.800]  It's amazing. We've got, we've got 20 acres of empty property. It was not, it was really cheap.
[3:53:51.800 --> 3:53:54.600]  You can go there and do whatever you want. You're about to say someone interrupts you. What was that?
[3:53:55.240 --> 3:53:59.960]  Yeah. Texas was a bad move for a lot of people. You know, they say Joe Rogan moves from California,
[3:53:59.960 --> 3:54:04.520]  Texas. He brings his policies with him. And then some people might argue, yeah, but Joe's not
[3:54:05.480 --> 3:54:10.520]  establishment. He's had the establishment. He'll be okay. Right? What about all of his staff?
[3:54:10.520 --> 3:54:14.040]  What about when Joe opens a comedy club and the people who are in California like
[3:54:14.040 --> 3:54:19.080]  opportunities in Texas? And that poll factor from Joe Rogan, from all these actors that are not
[3:54:19.080 --> 3:54:25.560]  moving in, polls all of these woke, lefty, NPC type individuals into Texas. I think there's a
[3:54:25.560 --> 3:54:29.640]  lot of good people moving in Texas, which could help it shift red. But if industry individuals
[3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:33.480]  like Elon Musk moves there, right? And he's going to bring all the California liberals. How many
[3:54:33.480 --> 3:54:37.640]  people does he employ? Tens of thousands? Oh, Apple's there. Austin is now like San Francisco
[3:54:37.640 --> 3:54:41.640]  or something. I mean, no, no, it's definitely the money. The leftist money is the big one.
[3:54:41.640 --> 3:54:45.880]  I mean, they are just there. So I thought about this and everyone said Texas,
[3:54:45.880 --> 3:54:50.200]  because you got the airports, you got the best airports, actually, you've got all the people
[3:54:50.200 --> 3:54:55.720]  are based, ignore Austin, whatever. And I'm like, how long, how long am I going to be there until
[3:54:55.720 --> 3:55:00.280]  the industry drags in more of these people who vote for garbage? West Virginia, you know why?
[3:55:00.280 --> 3:55:04.680]  Because people are leaving West Virginia. Blue voters, there's articles, AP wrote about this.
[3:55:04.680 --> 3:55:08.200]  Oh, it's beyond the Rust Belt, but it's nice people and it's beautiful. No, no, no, but look,
[3:55:08.200 --> 3:55:12.360]  look, there are people in West Virginia who are Democrat, urban and small towns who are like,
[3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:16.440]  I hate this. I hate this state. They love Trump. I'm leaving. And I'm like, hey, hey, hey,
[3:55:16.440 --> 3:55:20.920]  all right, I'll move in. There's an opportunity because West Virginia has been suffering for
[3:55:20.920 --> 3:55:25.960]  some time. And we'll find some, one of these smaller towns. Apparently, I've been saying on
[3:55:25.960 --> 3:55:30.520]  the show, we want to find one of these ghost towns, not a ghost town, but like it's falling
[3:55:30.520 --> 3:55:35.080]  into disrepair industries, leaving revitalize revitalize it instead of that's a smart move.
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:38.360]  That's what I'm thinking about. Well, check it out. Instead of buying a big corporate headquarters,
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:43.400]  we buy one building for now. And then when we need to expand, we buy the building next to it.
[3:55:43.400 --> 3:55:47.320]  And so it's actually cheaper because this is, it's an opportunity zone, right? That's what Gerald
[3:55:47.320 --> 3:55:52.280]  Salente did in Kingston, New York to a certain extent. And then we start telling other companies,
[3:55:52.280 --> 3:55:56.840]  you know, hey, and we're opening up a lot, headquarters, make your, your, your company
[3:55:56.840 --> 3:56:00.920]  can come. And then you're actually not bringing in industry people. And that's what America,
[3:56:00.920 --> 3:56:04.920]  the idea was all about is the exodus out of the big establishment, create the new. And I think
[3:56:04.920 --> 3:56:08.600]  so this is the American dream you're reestablishing here. So you've been here for a year and a half
[3:56:08.600 --> 3:56:15.080]  or so here a year. And so are you happy with it? You're amazing. Like the move. Yeah. West Virginia
[3:56:15.080 --> 3:56:22.440]  is key, you know, but I'll say this. If you're a city type, you will hate it. And I know this is
[3:56:22.440 --> 3:56:26.840]  a joke where a lot of people are like, Oh, don't come into West Virginia for a liberal. There's
[3:56:26.840 --> 3:56:32.680]  bears and there's guns. Let's be real. I'll tell you the reality. We've got four and a half acres.
[3:56:32.680 --> 3:56:37.080]  You got to mow the lawn. You want to mow that lawn? You don't want to mow that lawn. It takes you a
[3:56:37.080 --> 3:56:43.000]  long time. We got all of this. You got to go out bushwhacking. Look, there's a trail here. You,
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:47.960]  it is a lot to upkeep. And I realized something, especially with, I, I come, I wake up in the
[3:56:47.960 --> 3:56:52.440]  morning, I read the news, I record my first segment, and then I get out and tend to the chickens.
[3:56:52.440 --> 3:56:56.440]  I put on my muck boots, go step in the, in the, in the chicken crap. And then I got to make sure
[3:56:56.440 --> 3:57:01.720]  they got food and water. I got to check the eggs. It's nonstop work. It's not the sundown. You see,
[3:57:01.720 --> 3:57:05.160]  the city people don't like that. That's why they're always saying, give me, give me, give me.
[3:57:05.160 --> 3:57:09.320]  Thomas Sowell is a great quote. He said, I never understood why it's greed to want to keep what
[3:57:09.320 --> 3:57:13.720]  you've earned, but not greed when you try to take it from other people. You come out here, you can,
[3:57:13.720 --> 3:57:18.120]  you can make your own thing. We've grown our own plants. I had my own breakfast. Eggs, peppers,
[3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:23.000]  cherry tomatoes, all freshly grown by us here on our property. And you got a great house. And that's
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:27.160]  what Thomas Jefferson believed in, the power of the yeoman farmer, because they were close to land
[3:57:27.160 --> 3:57:30.520]  and they weren't easily counter manipulated because you can't con an honest man,
[3:57:30.520 --> 3:57:33.480]  can't pull. Let's go to your podcast. Thank you, buddy. That's great. Right.
