[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Yeah! Praise God America is Awakening! Humanity is Awakening! And Jesus Christ is King!
[00:25.000 --> 00:35.000]  Not David Rockefeller, not Bill Gates, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, but Jesus Christ is King!
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  And God gave us and rose up Donald Trump to stand against the enemy and draw out the enemy.
[00:41.000 --> 00:52.000]  So as dark as some of these days are, understand this is the beginning of the great revival before the Antichrist comes.
[00:52.000 --> 01:12.000]  World government, implantable microchips, Satanism is out of the open, the Bible is fulfilled, Revelation is fulfilled, Jesus Christ is fulfilled, God Almighty is in charge, and we follow that mighty God!
[01:12.000 --> 01:22.000]  You look at the miserable globalists, you look at people like Bill Gates, and you look at people like Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of them.
[01:22.000 --> 01:34.000]  They are miserable slaves of Satan, and we pray for them in hope that the Holy Spirit can still touch their soul.
[01:34.000 --> 01:46.000]  But more importantly, we pray for President Donald John Trump in this incredibly serious moment.
[01:46.000 --> 01:58.000]  And we pray for all the women in America who the system is trying to lie to to kill their babies, and we say, don't kill your babies!
[01:58.000 --> 02:18.000]  The enemy has been forced out in the open. World government is here, and the system is publicly stealing this election from the biggest landslide and the biggest political realignment since 1776.
[02:18.000 --> 02:34.000]  Our God is the God of the universe, our God is the God of strength and honor and will, and God is in control, and God is on our side!
[02:34.000 --> 02:46.000]  So we praise God, and we thank God, and we know that it's all in God's plan, and the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[02:46.000 --> 02:54.000]  Christ's crucifixion was not our defeat, it was our greatest victory.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  When he rose again on the third day, he broke the change of hell and death.
[03:02.000 --> 03:15.000]  We have the deed to this planet, we have the deed to eternal life, and we praise Jesus Christ and the Father.
[03:15.000 --> 03:30.000]  The enemy wants to keep the whorehouses open, and the liquor stores open, and the wallmarts open, and the targets, and the Amazons, while they tell you the churches are not essential.
[03:30.000 --> 03:38.000]  Congress shall make no law establishing the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.000]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or the free exercise thereof.
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.000]  Meaning, our forebears did not have separation of church and state as they spin it.
[03:51.000 --> 03:58.000]  It means the state has no jurisdiction over any of us.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  Our relationship with God is sacred and is eternal.
[04:03.000 --> 04:14.000]  So no, whatever happens, we will never give up, we will never surrender, we will never back down to the Satanic, pedophile, globalist, new-world order,
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  and their walking dead, reanimated corpse, Joe Biden.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  And we will never recognize him.
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  President Trump had zero connection to Russians, no proof, four years of investigation.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  With the Biden's hits open and shut.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  So I don't know who's going to the White House in 38 days, but I sure know this.
[04:41.000 --> 04:58.000]  Joe Biden is a globalist, and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  You can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced.
[05:16.000 --> 05:27.000]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her control.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.000]  This is world government.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  They're announcing the Christmas is canceled.
[05:41.000 --> 05:51.000]  This is what the Communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you, to take red of all your due process, and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  How long have we warned you about this?
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.000]  But you can fight back.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  America is the last bastion.
[05:56.000 --> 06:11.000]  Stop submitting.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  With the crisis, it's open and shut.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  So I don't know who's going to the White House in 38 days, but I sure know this.
[06:36.000 --> 06:47.000]  Joe Biden is a globalist and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  Our great first president, we literally are here on his farm.
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.000]  That's where we're at.
[06:53.000 --> 07:00.000]  George Washington didn't want to be king and had me serve two terms and set that precedent.
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  He left.
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.000]  He was a very quiet man.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  I didn't talk about his beliefs, but he was a Christian.
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  But those that knew him privately knew he knew God controlled battlefields.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  God controlled governments.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  God controls the games.
[07:13.000 --> 07:22.000]  And all his success was because of his love of God and being in line with God.
[07:22.000 --> 07:29.000]  So never forget, we worship the true God that created the universe and all of us.
[07:29.000 --> 07:36.000]  And the satanic globalists trying to take control of us and trying to play God are fallen and are failed.
[07:36.000 --> 07:43.000]  And we need to just keep our eyes on Christ and never back down and never surrender.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  At four o'clock today, we're going to march back to the Supreme Court.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  You got some other great folks at Freedom Plaza.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  If some of you aren't here later, go get them.
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  Leave them to Supreme Court at four at this great event.
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.000]  But pray for America.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  Pray for the world.
[07:57.000 --> 07:58.000]  Pray for Trump.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  And realize you're not going to get instant gratification.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  But with Trump, it's as close as it got.
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  Look how far we've come.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  Look at what we've been able to do.
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  And this is just the beginning.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  I'm going to turn this over to my buddy for two minutes.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  My great cohost at infoawards.com.
[08:13.000 --> 08:14.000]  Owen Schreuer.
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  And then the next great, the next great guest you're coming up at.
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  But remember this.
[08:20.000 --> 08:27.000]  God ordained this Republic to stand against the Satanic empires, the Nazis and the Communists and others.
[08:27.000 --> 08:36.000]  And so 1776 is God's number of victory over the Satanic 1984.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  God bless you all.
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.000]  And I salute you.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  Thank you, Jesus.
[08:41.000 --> 08:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday, December 14, 2020 transmission.
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.000]  And today is the day that the electors are supposed to vote.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  Whether they are going to be faithful or faithless.
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  But when the Democrats and the globalists steal an election, it is not just the right of the electors.
[09:09.000 --> 09:16.000]  It is the duty of those electors to do that.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  And so when the electors, I predict, will mainly go for Biden from the states that went for Biden.
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  Then you'll have some faithless that will say that there was enough fraud that they're going to go with Trump.
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  But I think they're going to try to claim that the electoral college has certified Biden today.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  Now that's not really true.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  There are more checks and balances.
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  And I've got some reports I'll be laying out.
[09:38.000 --> 09:49.000]  We've got Joe Hoff, he's a really smart statistician and big international auditor who has been the really the leading person out of a constellation of amazing researchers out there.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  There's been exposing the wide spectrum of fraud.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  He will be joining us, I believe, for the entire third hour.
[09:55.000 --> 10:07.000]  So we'll try to give him the floor to walk through just historically from the perspective of how big this theft is from the American people and if they're able to complete it, what we expect to come after that as well.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  We cannot give up yet.
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.000]  And I want to explain something.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  This is very complex, but it's also very, very simple at the same time.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  And so I'm going to try really my best to do this right now, because I want to tell you the truth.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  And I want to tell you what's really happening.
[10:25.000 --> 10:35.000]  And I want to give you my perspective and vision of how the globalist criminal continuum operates and where the central brain of it is taking us.
[10:35.000 --> 10:44.000]  And not even where the minion globalists think they're going or even their top generals and top wizards really don't get the full import of where they're going.
[10:44.000 --> 10:52.000]  That's why they want me off the air because they don't like their minions hearing what losers they are and how they're going to be destroyed.
[10:52.000 --> 11:17.000]  And that's why they're working very, very hard with over a thousand articles showing up on Google News alone over a thousand The New York Times, The Washington Post, RT, Daily Mail, Newsweek, calls for Alex Jones to be arrested after speech about removing Biden.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  Now, why do they want me arrested?
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  Well, they say I death-threaded him. That's not what I did. And that's actually the last thing I want.
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  This hit me talking on both sides of my mouth where I kind of make a veiled thread and then, and then, and then, oh, we don't want him to get hurt.
[11:32.000 --> 11:39.000]  The last thing we want is violence, especially towards that creature. They're planning to get rid of him and bring in Kamala.
[11:39.000 --> 11:50.000]  He's already said I might faint an illness and quit if the people running my operation don't agree with me. I mean, wow. Wow.
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  I'm not going to play the clip. You heard it last week.
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  So that's what this is turned into.
[11:59.000 --> 12:11.000]  And so it's not about Alex Jones. It's about they see me as the symbol of the populist movement that got Trump elected. They admit that. They've had CIA whole operations groups trying to get us off air.
[12:11.000 --> 12:22.000]  A bunch of leftists, a lot of patriots in the CIA and in the FBI and in the military have been supportive of us and they're good people, but they're not in the management positions.
[12:22.000 --> 12:35.000]  And they're just as disgusted as I am and very upset, but you've seen them striking back all the news of the Bidens being Communist Chinese agents and having all those files on top Americans that have been infiltrated by their Chai Comm operatives.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  I'm going to be talking about that coming up at the start of the next hour. Also tend to open the phones up.
[12:41.000 --> 12:52.000]  You know, I've met with former top folks.
[12:52.000 --> 13:02.000]  And I'll just leave it at that. And we had some interesting meetings and I separately ran into General Flynn and his security team ran up.
[13:02.000 --> 13:11.000]  They were behind the stage about to speak at the Jericho event that I was about to speak yet. You just saw some of and you saw me kind of jumped like you saw a ghost.
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  I said, are you scared? He said, no, no, thank you for working with my son. I really appreciate your work. And then he turned away from me.
[13:17.000 --> 13:25.000]  And I said, hey, don't be scared. Come here and shake my hand. Are you scared to be on camera with me? And he said, no, no, no, I'm just, but he seemed really scared.
[13:25.000 --> 13:32.000]  And I get it. Flynn's a great guy. But the judge had just re indicted him illegally. There's no such thing as he did it though.
[13:32.000 --> 13:40.000]  And so we don't care about your pardon. We're going to re indict you and send you to prison. So Flynn is just shell shocked and I get it.
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.000]  And people who scared of me. I mean, when you get seen on stage with me, they come after you. And I think Flynn's already been attacked so much.
[13:47.000 --> 13:57.000]  I met with some of the other military people and one fellow ran some of the current operations for Trump.
[13:57.000 --> 14:05.000]  And I'll just leave it at that. And that was a good meeting. And they told me about some of the things that we should relate to the listeners.
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  And so a lot happened in Washington, DC.
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.000]  I was right there in a hotel next to the White House. So we were able to have some meetings. They sent the secret service over to see us.
[14:18.000 --> 14:27.000]  And they sent some other people over to have little conversations with us. And they took our phones over our remote control and just to let us know they were in charge.
[14:27.000 --> 14:38.000]  And it was a very interesting time. But the army came by and one of Trump's he ran major operations for a while for Trump.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  And another individual dropped by. We had a nice little conversation.
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.000]  But let's just say we were both the feds told us we were under surveillance. So it was it was quite the trip.
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  It's like you're under surveillance. We're here to follow you. We know you're good. Just we're in order to be here because Biden's already taken over.
[14:56.000 --> 15:04.000]  Biden's already in charge. Basically, everybody's abandoned Trump. 99% of people positions of power. They're all wanting their next job.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  Well, Trump's own daughter won't even say he really won his son's will.
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  So everybody is just thinking about themselves right now them Don Jr.
[15:15.000 --> 15:27.000]  And so that's why we got to be honest with you about the stakes and you know where things are because this is not a game for the fate of heart.
[15:27.000 --> 15:37.000]  You know, you're tough. Well, they try to put your ass in prison and follow you around 24 seven. A lot of people get scared because they just can't believe America is like the Soviet Union.
[15:37.000 --> 15:45.000]  It's not that they're scared. They're startled. All right, we'll be right back in full wars.com and news wars.com tomorrow's news today.

[18:07.000 --> 18:26.000]  Here's the good news.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  And it's the bad news at the same time.
[18:29.000 --> 18:40.000]  I told you that I would tell you the truth about our situation. It's fantastically horrible. But on the end of it the enemies destroyed.
[18:40.000 --> 18:52.000]  So I'm going to really try to unpack that statement and I think you all know that's true. I think you all know we deserve what's about to happen to us.
[18:52.000 --> 19:02.000]  That are on the devil side really deserve it. So let's just go through this together and get closer to Christ.
[19:02.000 --> 19:21.000]  You already have to go to the other side of the planet to hear there's HIV in the vaccine. You have to go to the other side of the planet to even hear that a major leak of Chinese government documents how they took over the Democratic Party and how they took over the major fortune 100.
[19:21.000 --> 19:36.000]  But again that's part of the process. And this face sucking globalist system is going to be so hard to get off of us that it's going to kill us in the process.
[19:36.000 --> 19:51.000]  Metaphysically. But see countries and populations and ideas are transcendent. So you can have the death of something but then it rises again.
[19:51.000 --> 20:00.000]  So I'll try to unpack that and lay that out but this is the real world because I don't want you to get demoralized when they put Joe Biden in on January 20th.
[20:00.000 --> 20:11.000]  And right now on our current trajectory. That's what's going to happen. Remember I told you about the 79 days of hell. Told you about all the real stuff. This isn't fantasy land stuff.
[20:11.000 --> 20:20.000]  This isn't breadcrumbs on the Internet. This is the real stuff guys.
[20:20.000 --> 20:30.000]  It really comes down to a choice of what are we going to do because the New World Order is going to put us into a total depression. They're never going to take their boot off our neck. We're going to have to take the boot off our neck.
[20:30.000 --> 20:41.000]  And when we try to just defend ourselves they're going to call that violent. That's why they're saying I called for violence and called for the murder of Joe Biden though that's not true because they're putting that idea out.
[20:41.000 --> 20:52.000]  So I can be made an example of that when they just accuse you of that you get killed or you get arrested because that's the wheelhouse we're going into. And if you think you can hide from this.
[20:52.000 --> 21:01.000]  And if you think you can just grovel to them and you'll survive longer than others. That's how their whole algorithm works and it's how they get everybody.
[21:01.000 --> 21:08.000]  So I'm here to be first in line. Just like I was first in line to be totally banned and demonized. I'm first in line.
[21:08.000 --> 21:19.000]  Kill me. Put me in prison do whatever it is. I'm not backing down. I'm not signing on to your Satanism. And I pray to God to give me strength and I commit my soul into Jesus Christ hands.
[21:19.000 --> 21:34.000]  And that's it. Because it's you that serves Satan that will have vengeance delivered on you by God, not by me. I'm not going to harm a hair on your filthy head Joe Biden. God is going to use you to destroy the New World Order.
[21:34.000 --> 21:45.000]  As God uses all evil men in the end to bring down the system. But God's got to have good men that are willing to stand.
[21:45.000 --> 21:55.000]  Anyway, since I mentioned Australia, here's a clip of them talking about the big chai con thing. It's hardly on the news here or it's like, oh, big deal with Chinese run everything. Here it is.
[21:55.000 --> 22:10.000]  But tonight I start with some breaking news that will be front page of the Australian tomorrow and big news in the UK as well. Amid rising tensions in the Australia-China relationship, there has now been a major leak of official records from the Chinese Communist Party.
[22:10.000 --> 22:28.000]  It is believed to be the first leak of its kind in the world. A register with the details of nearly 2 million Communist Party members. It includes their name, party position, birth date, national ID number, ethnicity, and in some cases, even their phone number.
[22:28.000 --> 22:40.000]  What's amazing about this database is not just that it exposes people who are members of the Communist Party and who are now living and working all over the world from Australia to the US to the UK.
[22:40.000 --> 22:48.000]  But it's amazing because it lifts the lid on how the party operates under President and Chairman Xi Jinping.
[22:48.000 --> 22:58.000]  But this leak shows that party branches are embedded in some of the world's biggest companies and even inside government agencies. That's right.
[22:58.000 --> 23:14.000]  Communist Party branches have been set up inside Western companies, allowing the infiltration of those companies by CCP members who, if called on, are answerable directly to the Communist Party, to the Chairman, the President himself.
[23:14.000 --> 23:29.000]  Along with the personal identifying details of 1.95 million Communist Party members, mostly from Shanghai, there are also the details of 79,000 Communist Party branches, many of them inside companies.
[23:29.000 --> 23:53.000]  This leak, and it's going to be front page of the Australian Tomorrow and a big story in the UK as well, is a significant security breach that is likely to embarrass the Chinese President. But it's also going to embarrass some global companies who appear to have no plan in place to protect their intellectual property from theft, from economic espionage.
[23:53.000 --> 24:06.000]  Now, Australia is a very sophisticated question, and it's a very sophisticated government that has been put in charge by the British Crown from beginning to oppress their great people.
[24:06.000 --> 24:14.000]  But they have a great culture at the same time, and the Chai comms almost took Australia over completely.
[24:14.000 --> 24:26.000]  And they've got most of their major cities are run by Chai comm double agent operatives, so they're in the middle of trying to remove it. And the Chai comms are one dimensional, they thought just shut off all the Western economies and hurt people.
[24:26.000 --> 24:37.000]  The central government of Australia has been letting the Chai comms shut them down to then now blame them and fully get them out of there.
[24:37.000 --> 24:46.000]  So the Aussies really pulled something on the Chai comms, I can tell you. And that's what we need here. That's what we need Trump to do.
[24:46.000 --> 24:53.000]  And I'll talk about it next segment. He's just come out and completely level with everybody and just point blank, state it like it is.
[24:53.000 --> 25:00.000]  And by the way, Trump doesn't need me to tell him that. What do you think all this is you're about to see?
[25:00.000 --> 25:07.000]  I'm just telling you, the globalists are not intending to stop even when it comes out there Chinese agents. And it's totally illegal.
[25:07.000 --> 25:16.000]  Because then it comes down to the point where, well, the FBI is in charge of that. And they're not going to do a damn thing, because they're so compromised.
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.000]  And they're not just blackmailing people for money they took 20 years ago or whatever, they're threatening to kill them.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  And most people can't handle their wife having somebody come up to them at the grocery store and threaten to cut their head off.
[25:29.000 --> 25:41.000]  Most people can't handle, you know, really scary men messing with their kids at school and, you know, like calling up Jim Garrison and saying, hey, we saw your little girl playing in the backyard.
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.000]  They were in that Pugatot dress. We're going to cut her head off, son of a bitch. But first we're going to rape her to death.
[25:47.000 --> 25:55.000]  Well, Jim Garrison had guts. He didn't back down, but most people can't handle it.
[25:55.000 --> 26:04.000]  And, you know, that's why when I saw General Flynn, and he was basically like really shaken. See, it's in and like the leftist Q side thing.
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  Oh, look, the great Flynn, it doesn't like Jones. No, he said, thank you for working with my son. Thank you for what you've done.
[26:10.000 --> 26:17.000]  And then turned away looking for cameras because he doesn't want to get in more trouble and have more problems being associated with me.
[26:17.000 --> 26:29.000]  It doesn't matter. When General Flynn was off running Defense Intelligence Agency, I was in the trenches of America, waging war on the globalist and waking the entire planet up to build the platform of the resistance.
[26:29.000 --> 26:37.000]  And that's what we've done. And it's people power and ground power that's going to defeat the New World Order, not Alex Jones, not General Flynn, not Donald Trump.
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  It's going to be you not submitting and taking action in this whole thing.
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  Now, do you think Flynn's just scared of the M4 war and scared of the association with it?
[26:48.000 --> 26:54.000]  Imagine how the globalists feel about it. They fear you. That's why they hate me.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  LEMSTER's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[26:58.000 --> 27:08.000]  Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News. Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.000]  Okay? It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity. These are real numbers. These are real facts.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  Well, the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[27:47.000 --> 27:54.000]  You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  I've got some really exciting good news and I've also got some bad news.
[27:59.000 --> 28:06.000]  M4 Wars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[28:06.000 --> 28:13.000]  Despite all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us, you with your word of mouth have overridden that
[28:13.000 --> 28:19.000]  and they are so scared of M4Wars.com and Bandod video and they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  But we're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December right now.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  This is our most important month to be able to fund ourselves in the next year.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  And I understand the economy shut down. I understand there's not as much money as there used to be.
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery, but M4 Wars really needs your support.
[28:35.000 --> 28:41.000]  You just buy great items. Do your Christmas shopping at M4Wars.com with huge sales, amazing products.
[28:41.000 --> 28:48.000]  And then you know you're funding the M4 War and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses.
[28:48.000 --> 28:54.000]  Continue to fund the Second American Revolution while getting great products at the same time at M4Wars.com. Thank you.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  Three months ago we sold out of our privacy pouches.
[28:58.000 --> 29:06.000]  The reason we sold out is they are super high quality and it's all over the news that the UN and the Clintons and Microsoft and others
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  and contact tracers are tracking everywhere you go and everything you do.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  They admit it's a cover for bringing in their cashless society, AI system of total control.
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.000]  So to block the UN, to block the globalists, to get in the habit of realizing what a surveillance system phones are,
[29:19.000 --> 29:25.000]  everybody needs a privacy pocket. They fit almost all sizes of droids and iPhones from small to big.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  They also make a great gift to educate friends and family about what's going on.
[29:29.000 --> 29:34.000]  Now again, there's lots of privacy pocket type systems out there, most of them are about 90% effective.
[29:34.000 --> 29:40.000]  We found a model that's actually pretty inexpensive and has around 99% effectiveness.
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.000]  If you're right under a cell tower, it'll still blast through the fair day cage.
[29:43.000 --> 29:50.000]  They're at M4Wars.com at $19.95. This exact same system is sold everywhere else for $29. It's still a great deal.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  We sell a lot of these. We have the best price. It is a great Christmas gift.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  M4Wars.com
[30:23.000 --> 30:28.000]  I was riding on a folk coast and everything was fine.
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  So we took a shorter road to save some time.
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.000]  The bandits only fired once. They shot me in the chest.
[30:37.000 --> 30:44.000]  They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  The better men have got to stand.
[30:46.000 --> 30:52.000]  Better men have got to realize that this is part of the continuum.
[30:52.000 --> 30:55.000]  This is part of the fight.
[30:55.000 --> 31:00.000]  And it's got to be us that puts our weight and our will against the new order and never surrenders,
[31:00.000 --> 31:06.000]  and who become invigorated in the fight, not exhausted.
[31:06.000 --> 31:11.000]  You know, during the break, the great camera operator and boom operator, John,
[31:11.000 --> 31:14.000]  that does an amazing job as a smart guy, too, because we love the news tips.
[31:14.000 --> 31:18.000]  He goes, hey, are you going to hit the giant forensic audit confirmed by the state of Michigan
[31:18.000 --> 31:23.000]  of total systematic fraud, Dominion designed as an organized crime unit to carry out fraud
[31:23.000 --> 31:26.000]  at an industrial level?
[31:26.000 --> 31:33.000]  That's a big, respected auditing firm. The judge authorized its release.
[31:33.000 --> 31:36.000]  Of course, it's designed for fraud by dictators, for dictators.
[31:36.000 --> 31:41.000]  The Chai comms put 400 million into it on October 7th.
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  And yes, I am going to cover that.
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  Joe Hoft is a big statistician auditor, corporate auditor.
[31:48.000 --> 31:51.000]  He has been tipping the spear, exposing a lot of this.
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  He's going to be on in the third hour to go into all of it and great detail,
[31:54.000 --> 31:56.000]  but I want to explain something.
[31:56.000 --> 32:01.000]  I'm glad John raised that because this is the point I was about to already make before he said that to me.
[32:01.000 --> 32:06.000]  None of this matters if we don't expose that Joe Biden's a communist Chinese agent.
[32:06.000 --> 32:09.000]  And even if he won the election, which he didn't, he is illegitimate.
[32:09.000 --> 32:13.000]  We must start that attack now before he weasels his way in there,
[32:13.000 --> 32:18.000]  that he cannot be allowed to be the damn president.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  Imagine if you said, you know, I bet underneath that piece of plywood over there in the junkyard,
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.000]  there's a rattlesnake. You go lift it up, there's no rattlesnake.
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  Well, I bet over there there's a water moccasin underneath that barrel.
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  You know, there's no water moccasin.
[32:31.000 --> 32:34.000]  Well, I bet there's a copperhead in those plants over there.
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  I saw one. You go over there, there's no copperhead.
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.000]  Now that's the Democrats about Trump being a Russian agent.
[32:41.000 --> 32:46.000]  Joe Biden is a barrel of snakes, a snake farm.
[32:46.000 --> 32:51.000]  Just snakes? What snakes are like? It's like Indiana Jones Temple of Doom.
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  There's just snakes everywhere.
[32:54.000 --> 32:59.000]  When it comes to communist China and Russia, the guy is a slot machine.
[32:59.000 --> 33:02.000]  The guy is a vending machine.
[33:02.000 --> 33:11.000]  The guy literally sells out multi-billion dollar deals for like a million dollars apiece.
[33:11.000 --> 33:14.000]  He sells out 20 billion dollar deals for 20 million.
[33:14.000 --> 33:21.000]  I mean, the guy would sell his mother for a stick of bubble gum.
[33:21.000 --> 33:27.000]  He is the greatest lawyer, sack of garbage, no vision, no nothing.
[33:27.000 --> 33:31.000]  He'll do anything.
[33:31.000 --> 33:37.000]  And so that's what needs to be exposed is that, yeah, the media is covering up all the fraud.
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  Yeah, they're threatening the legislatures.
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  Yeah, they're threatening the Supreme Court.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  Yeah, we're being betrayed because the swamp is made out of weak people that comply.
[33:46.000 --> 33:53.000]  The system's been weakening us and getting rid of strong individuals for decades.
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  Here's an illustration.
[33:55.000 --> 34:04.000]  Major transgender activist group calls for all boys to be sterilized.
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  People are like, wow, what do you think the goal is?
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.000]  The newer lawyer wants to get rid of a group, Europeans, the West.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  You kill them in.
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  Well, you can't like Pharaoh, who ordered the firstborn of the Israelites killed.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  That's in Ramsey's writings.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  It's carved in stone.
[34:22.000 --> 34:31.000]  The Ten Commandments, as far as Ramsey's existing and the Israelites leaving, that all happened.
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.000]  And he said, his father said, I want every firstborn of the Israelites killed.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  There's too many men.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  Everybody knew it's firstborns that get the genetic compliment more than others.
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  Whatever reason, it's not just that they're around adults only.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  There are always kids in the village and they're always around other kids.
[34:47.000 --> 34:56.000]  It's something proven with firstborn males, especially that there's a transference of genetic memory and activation at the cellular level.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  It happens to some firstborn girls, but it's been mainly men.
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  And it's also another mammal species as well.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  They don't know why.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  Like in breeding, a lot of times the first, like two champion horses, you breed them.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  And the first, they'll try to select for male race horses.
[35:11.000 --> 35:12.000]  And they'll select.
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  And it's that first one they have that's the one.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  That horse can have 20.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  But it's that first one.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  There's just something happens.
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  And so why did every ancient culture, the Aztecs demanded firstborn males of whatever group they conquered.
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  They'd say, we got to do a sacrifice.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  Give us your firstborn men.
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.000]  I'd be five years old.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  I'd be 10 years old.
[35:32.000 --> 35:39.000]  You had to pony up sterilizing a child for a better life.
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  The Atlantic.
[35:40.000 --> 35:48.000]  Imagine a massive sick headline about chemically sterilizing, stunting their growth, all of it.
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  That's what all this is about.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  Of course they're stealing the election.
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  They have to.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  They can't have the repudiation of everything the new order stands for.
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  They can't have their whole globalist system fall apart.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  They have to say, no, we reject that.
[36:05.000 --> 36:15.000]  Give us the image, not of a strong man, not of a good man, not of someone of honor, but give us the image of a crypt keeper, a reanimated corpse.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  Now, obviously a 10 year old would know what that means.
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  A five year old would know what that means.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  Calling saying someone looks like a dead body isn't threatening to kill them.
[36:24.000 --> 36:33.000]  It's because if they look like a dead body, if they hobble around like a skeleton with a thin piece of skin over its face.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  Everyone gets that Joe Biden is a crypt keeper.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  Everybody gets Joe Biden is way past his expiration date.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  Everybody gets what that means.
[36:43.000 --> 36:58.000]  But because it's true by the alchemy of fraud, 1000 plus publications, CNN, you name it, Alex Jones is threatened to kill Joe Biden.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  And most articles don't even show you the video.
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.000]  They'll show you the video, but in the context, if they are that stupid, which they're not, let me decipher for him.
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  I said, I don't know what's going to happen in 38 days.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  I don't know who'll be in there, but one way or another, he'll be removed.
[37:12.000 --> 37:21.000]  And then I went into how he's a Chinese agent and how he's got all the dirt on him and how he's a globalist and how he will get removed, meaning by impeachment or he'll step down.
[37:21.000 --> 37:29.000]  Why the hell would I a want to go to prison saying kill some of the president elect as they call him.
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  And turning into a damn martyr.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  That's the last thing I'd ever wanted.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  They know that.
[37:36.000 --> 37:42.000]  They know that full well.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  But that's why they lie.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  Here's what I actually said.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  And again, it's bigger than Alex Jones.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  Their move now is, oh, everyone against them is anti-democracy.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  No, we're for our republic.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  All of us are violent.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  All of us want to hurt Joe Biden.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  What is that telegraph?
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  Well, it telegraphs their next move, which is if I was them, I wouldn't do this.
[38:02.000 --> 38:03.000]  I'm saying I understand their mindset.
[38:03.000 --> 38:11.000]  If I was evil like them, if I was a reprobate, if I was a Satanist like them, the next move will be a giant false flags to be blamed on Liberty Movement.
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  That way you can't criticize Obama or you're for the terrorism.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  They're going to quit free speech with terrorism.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.000]  They're already doing it.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  That's their next move.
[38:17.000 --> 38:18.000]  And that's where this is coming.
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  And that's why Trump can't let Biden get in and we can't let him either.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  Because once they get him in, all hell's coming.
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.000]  It's not going to go away.
[38:26.000 --> 38:27.000]  They don't want to just loot stuff.
[38:27.000 --> 38:28.000]  They've been doing that for 40 years.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  They're going to end the country as we know it.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  That's their game plan.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  So it's not just it.
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  Biden might have a shot at getting in.
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  They're stealing it all, but it's so outrageous and so big and so evil.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  It should backfire and should be repudiated.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  But if it's not, they're going to take that as a green light to go all the way.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  Here's what I actually said.
[38:49.000 --> 38:58.000]  With the Biden's hits open and shut, so I don't know who's going to the White House in 38 days, but I sure know this.
[38:58.000 --> 39:09.000]  Joe Biden is a globalist and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.000]  Our great first president, we literally are here on his farm.
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  Now again, you got to watch the whole eight-minute speech to get what really happened because the way the news did it is,
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  they took something from the first of speech, something from the middle, something from the end.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Like, he's a crepe keeper.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  He's walking dead saying the guy's a puppet.
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.000]  Then they cut that into, he'll be removed one way or another to again try to deceive in text.
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  That's all they are.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  It's frauds and you know that.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  So the good news is you repudiated them.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  Trump won.
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  You rejected them.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  But now they're going to try to convince you that this creature is your president.
[39:45.000 --> 40:14.000]  It's not going to work any way you slice it as long as we keep resisting.
[40:14.000 --> 40:21.000]  It's quite so important to those of you out there that have supported the broadcasts and the websites and the films and all the rest of the information we put out
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  to realize how important your work has been and to redouble your efforts.
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  Also, as Christmas, he's almost here.

[40:50.000 --> 41:13.000]  And again, thank you all for your support and Merry Christmas.
[41:13.000 --> 41:38.000]  Thank you.
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.000]  I'll start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[41:47.000 --> 41:54.000]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[41:58.000 --> 42:08.000]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalist, big tech and big farmer are all pushing the COVID's most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  That's why you see somebody dying into other nursing homes.
[42:14.000 --> 42:22.000]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine,
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  especially the mRNA ones, are basically bioweapons that are super deadly and now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  When they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  They have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  And that's on the record, it does that.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  Guillain-Barre's, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you,
[42:41.000 --> 42:47.000]  save and effective, no one's getting hurt, it's a conspiracy theory, and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly.
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.000]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe, they do it.
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.000]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  They are forcing mutations.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.000]  This is forced evolution or de-evolution.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out,
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.000]  they are not to produce people that are smarter or folks that live longer or are more oral.
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.000]  No, it's turning humanity into a commodity.
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  Now, we see some propaganda like communist China bragging,
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers Superman.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.000]  We'll send things with that into our troops and thousands and thousands of died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas's health department.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  They say, Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people.
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  That's for a greater good.
[43:41.000 --> 43:47.000]  But that's not even true, and it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal state law.
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  This is violence being carried out against us by that of the charity,
[43:50.000 --> 44:12.000]  and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  Nobody stood up for those 60-plus million babies we tortured to death,
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  or the tens of millions they've kept alive and harvest their organs now.
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  So God's going to let evil hurt us.
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.000]  So as much as I hate the globalists and their satanic activities,
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  God's not going to let innocence be targeted anymore without us all getting burned really bad.
[44:42.000 --> 44:48.000]  I was talking to a police officer, a couple of off-duty black cops that were driving us around,
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  taking care of us doing a great job in D.C.
[44:51.000 --> 44:57.000]  We usually hire about six or seven of those great fellows,
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  because that's the group of cops we're able to hire, they're great people.
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  They are all black people.
[45:01.000 --> 45:02.000]  So why are you hiring only black people?
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  That's who they are, they're great guys.
[45:04.000 --> 45:11.000]  And man, the stories they were telling me yesterday over dinner before we left D.C. or late lunch
[45:11.000 --> 45:18.000]  about finding a baby in a microwave.
[45:18.000 --> 45:19.000]  That's a real story.
[45:19.000 --> 45:26.000]  The guy's first day on work eight years ago was a young woman, 18 years old on PCP.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  People say, well, why don't you just ban PCP?
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  You can't, folks.
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.000]  I don't want to say what PCP is, because it'll get out there.
[45:37.000 --> 45:43.000]  But if people want to know, it's, I mean, it's embalming fluid,
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  and there's a bunch of other things that are similar,
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  and people soak a cigarette in it or a joint in it, and they smoke it,
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  and they don't know who they are.
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.000]  And they get to the house, the woman's mother's in a wheelchair,
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  she couldn't stop her, and the microwave's still going,
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  and he gets the baby out while it's all frying and still alive, and it dies in his hands.
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.000]  Now, see, that's the real evil, folks.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  And we all know that little three-month-old baby put that microwave.
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  That was a human.
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  That was horrible.
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  We have empathy, but we don't have the empathy for the baby that's nine months old,
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  the baby that just got born, that they passed laws in New York in places where,
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  if they say we keep it comfortable, we say it's not resuscitated.
[46:25.000 --> 46:26.000]  It's still alive.
[46:26.000 --> 46:27.000]  That's the legal term.
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.000]  The heart's beating.
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  It's healthy, but we're going to say it's not a human.
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.000]  So we can keep it alive a few weeks to get all the orders in for the organs,
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.000]  then have a procedure where they kill the baby.
[46:39.000 --> 46:44.000]  That's going on in 2019 in New York and four other states.
[46:44.000 --> 46:49.000]  Last time I checked in Virginia, even passed that law, they were trying to.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  They got a soft-spoken southern gentleman up there,
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  and, well, we keep the baby comfortable,
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.000]  and we don't want the police involved, not the courts, just the mother and the doctor,
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.000]  and maybe some other people from the board come.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  We decide what to do.
[47:05.000 --> 47:10.000]  We don't want to waste that seven pounds of meat.
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.000]  Oh, but when Governor Northam does it, it's liberal.
[47:14.000 --> 47:24.000]  But when a woman on PCP puts the baby in the microwave, she's a monster.
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.000]  But what she was was a human soul removed by that drug out of the way
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  so something else could come in.
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  Oh, she felt terrible after she learned she killed her baby.
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.000]  What made her do it?
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.000]  What was what did the drug do?
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  What door did it open?
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  And you realize that the same thing that wanted to microwave her baby
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  that thought it was just standing there in front of the microwave,
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  just watching it pop and its eyeballs come out and sizzling and these convulsing.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  It was like watching the most beautiful TV program it had ever seen.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  He walks into that dirty kitchen and there's that baby popping and sputtering.
[47:58.000 --> 47:59.000]  He's like, what is it?
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  And he opens the door and the smell of the baby rolls out in his face,
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  and he starts throwing up everywhere.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  Oh, now the cops are bad guys, though.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  Well, who are we going to have go deal with that?
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  Well, I hear you.
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  This is the breakup of society, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  And it's a spirit.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  And it's evil.
[48:22.000 --> 48:29.000]  And we all know it and we have to stop going along with it.
[48:29.000 --> 48:35.000]  Now, we're showing you an actual order form online for how old the baby is.
[48:35.000 --> 48:41.000]  And now the order form is for alive babies that they quote have not resuscitated.
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  Again, that's a legal term.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  Hearts beating, bloods going, babies happy.
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  They're even giving baby a bottle so that baby doesn't, you know,
[48:48.000 --> 48:57.000]  die before they get them goodies out of them.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  So, oh, oh, would they steal an election?
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  I don't know, though.
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.000]  Keep babies alive and take their organs.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  Get a poor mama in there.
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  Man, your baby was not too good.
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  You don't want to resuscitate babies right over here alive.
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  Just sign that form.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  You're on about five different types of drugs right now.
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  Thank you very much.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  Appreciate that.
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.000]  And the FBI is not going to do anything because that's how corruption works.
[49:24.000 --> 49:34.000]  Once they get something set in culture and get enough people to do it and enough crime committed.
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  And enough people have gone along with wearing the mask,
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.000]  taking the inoculations, getting sick, kids getting sick, neighbors dying.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  Humans will then tough it out and say, well, we did it for the greater good.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  And don't you bitch about it.
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.000]  You know, your young men need to roll up their sleeves and the military and take those experimental shots.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  Well, some died, but it's for a greater good.
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  And, well, we've got too many aggressive boys out there.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  Riddlin' hadn't worked too good frying their brains.
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  We got 90% of the college graduates going to be women and, you know, men of the new slaves.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  But that's not good enough.
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  Let's target every little boy and let's, let's put them all on hormone blockers.
[50:13.000 --> 50:19.000]  So they are stunted and don't grow and, and have, and have all sorts of weird tumors that grow.
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  And because it's beautiful and there's nothing more beautiful as black lives matter.
[50:23.000 --> 50:33.000]  What about Soros says that a black trans man, trans woman, because it's a black man that we've drugged and castrated.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  And that's the most beautiful thing in the world, isn't it?
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.000]  I would be walking around and shake 50 hands, just anywhere in DC, listeners everywhere.
[50:42.000 --> 50:52.000]  There's a lot of Trump folks were in town, but a weird old crazy looking old man, look like a child molester came by and he goes, black lives matter.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  And he's a white guy.
[50:53.000 --> 51:01.000]  He just says some Soros group thing that believes in ending the black family, ending the family period, castrating black men.
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  And then he says to me like it's a magic incantation.
[51:04.000 --> 51:09.000]  Black lives matter when their whole system is to kill black people first.
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  They want to get everybody.
[51:11.000 --> 51:20.000]  I mean, typed in Alex Jones HIV this morning, Alex Jones HIV COVID-19.
[51:20.000 --> 51:26.000]  And there were hundreds of debunking articles from March and April and saying Alex Jones is insane.
[51:26.000 --> 51:32.000]  There's no HIV insertions in COVID-19, even though it was in all the prestigious medical reports.
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  And now it's not just in Australia.
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  I got contacted last night by sources in Europe in the trials.
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  People heard about the positives for HIV from the vaccine.
[51:44.000 --> 51:50.000]  They went and they got tested because they've been in the trials and they have HIV.
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  And that's going to be breaking the next 48 hours.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  And then it's just kind of like, well, it's a false positive.
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  You got HIV.
[51:58.000 --> 52:05.000]  And then later when you get an autoimmune disease in five years, it takes that long to take you over cell by cell.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  And your body shuts off just like the top EU scientist says it will do.
[52:09.000 --> 52:17.000]  He followed an injunction December 1st on it with the former chief science officer of Pfizer.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  Wow.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  Wow.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  So I'll just tell you, I'll just level with you.
[52:24.000 --> 52:30.000]  I disagree with David Knight on some things where I think he's going on a one dimensional view of things,
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.000]  but that's okay because that's how the public understands things sometimes.
[52:36.000 --> 52:43.000]  But he's absolutely right that Trump is wrong to a push warp speed and Trump is wrong.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  I know why Trump did it.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  I know why he got manipulated to do it.
[52:45.000 --> 52:50.000]  I think Trump's a good person, but he needs to repudiate it and he's to come out against it.
[52:50.000 --> 52:55.000]  People ask me on the street like, well, David, I'm bashing Trump for warp speed and you're saying Trump's still good.
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  You know, why is your operation not saying the same thing?
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  I'm like, because we're not a cult.
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  Like in court hearings, they go, well, Paul Watson thought Sandy Hook happened just the way they said it.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  And then you, you questioned it.
[53:06.000 --> 53:07.000]  Well, who's talking points?
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  Who's making the time?
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  He has his opinion.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  I had mine.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  I'm allowed to question things.
[53:12.000 --> 53:18.000]  But see, everybody always thinks like I'm telling Owen Troyer what to do or David Knight's telling me what to do.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  Or I'm telling the likes of how this works.
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.000]  I think somebody's smart and upstanding and has a big grasp of things.
[53:23.000 --> 53:28.000]  Then we put them on air because we're fighting the new world order, but we're not a cult.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  But it's CNN or MSNBC.
[53:30.000 --> 53:40.000]  There is a talking point memo given out and that is what you say and that is what you follow and that is what you do.
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  So yes, if they remove Trump, it'll be bad.
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  They're going to come after us.
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  It's going to be absolutely a nightmare.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  But that's what statins do.
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  They can't help themselves.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  They don't think really six, seven, eight moves ahead.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  And I can tell you, without a shadow of a doubt, they are able to remove Trump.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  They're going to drop the hammer on everybody, including me.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  I'm not looking forward to it.
[53:58.000 --> 54:09.000]  But in the end, it's going to accelerate the unborn getting the relief they need and us and the born getting the relief and the old people and the medical patients and all the secret experimenting.
[54:09.000 --> 54:17.000]  Because we've stopped valuing each other and we've stopped being territorial and we stopped standing up for each other.
[54:17.000 --> 54:20.000]  And so when we act like that, we become slaves.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  I didn't plug this hour.
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  You don't do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  It's not in your interest to do it somewhere else.

[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  Stay with us.

[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  Thanks for your support.
[56:42.000 --> 57:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:10.000 --> 57:18.000]  In a major leak of official records from the Chinese Communist Party, it is believed to be the first leak of its kind in the world.
[57:18.000 --> 57:24.000]  A register with the details of nearly two million Communist Party members.
[57:24.000 --> 57:32.000]  It includes their name, party position, birthdate, national ID number, ethnicity, and in some cases, even their phone number.
[57:32.000 --> 57:41.000]  But this leak shows that party branches are embedded in some of the world's biggest companies and even inside government agencies.
[57:41.000 --> 58:06.000]  New emails obtained by the New York Post reveal that Hunter Biden pursued lucrative deals involving China's largest private energy company, including one that he said would be interesting for me and my family.
[58:06.000 --> 58:20.000]  In particular, an email obtained by the New York Post shows that on May 13, 2017, with the subject line, expectations included details for six people involved in an unspecified business venture.
[58:20.000 --> 58:33.000]  Biden was identified as chair slash vice chair, depending on agreement with the CEFC, an apparent reference to the former Shanghai based conglomerate CEFC China Energy Company.
[58:33.000 --> 58:52.000]  100 details is pay as 850. This email also introduced a provisional agreement where 80% of the equity would be doled out equally among four people whose initials reflect the sender and three recipients with H apparently referring to Biden.
[58:52.000 --> 59:06.000]  Jim Biden's referenced as 10%, doesn't say Biden, it says Jim, and then it has 10% for the big guy held by H. I 1,000% sit here and know that the big guy is referencing Joe Biden.
[59:06.000 --> 59:20.000]  That's crystal clear to me because I lived it. I met with the former vice president in person multiple times, and I had been meeting and talking with Hunter Biden and Jim Biden and Rob Walker and James Killier.
[59:20.000 --> 59:34.000]  Another incriminating email sent by Hunter details his deal that he created with the chairman of CEFC Yi Jingming for 50% of a holding company that was expected to provide Biden with $10 million a year.
[59:34.000 --> 59:40.000]  Yi apparently also threw in the gift of a 2.8 carat diamond after a Miami business meeting.
[59:40.000 --> 59:55.000]  Yi, who had ties to the Chinese military and intelligence service, hasn't been seen since being taken into custody by Chinese authorities in early 2018, and CEFC went bankrupt earlier this year according to reports.
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  Hunter was caught on tape crying in his cupcake about the ordeal solidifying its legitimacy.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I have another New York Times reporter calling about my representation of the, literally, Dr. Patrick Coe, the spy chief of China, who started the company that my partner, who was worth $323 billion, found it.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  It is now missing. The richest man in the world is missing. Who was my partner?
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  We now know that Hunter earned at least $6 million using his family name to leverage influence with the Chinese Communist Party in under nine months, and that attorney general Barr sat on the Hunter Biden tax investigation since last spring, now facing the music after the election is over.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  As attorneys for Hunter and James Biden are refusing to cooperate with a Senate committee, why should they? As Joe Biden clutches for the ring of Sauron, Breitbart also reported that a 2017 email published by NBC News revealed Hunter Biden reportedly did not disclose $400,000 in income from the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma in 2014 and had been advised to do so.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  Biden wrote that Yee had sweetened the terms of an earlier three-year consulting contract with CEFC. That was to pay him $10 million annually for introductions alone.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  America, Joe Biden, as frail and inept as he is, may go down in history as the greatest traitor this country has ever seen, or the last president and first dictator this country has ever seen.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  John Ballant reporting.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Another great product that's been selling out because people realize it's got so many great vitamins and minerals and saupon meadow is prostigar.

[1:02:51.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  All right, welcome back to our number two. I don't want to jump the gun here because the media will misrepresent what I've said and said that I said Julian Assange has been pardoned.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  I'm not saying that. Cassandra Fairbanks is one of the few people that is able to see him whenever he's allowed to see just a few visitors every three or four months.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  She's a wonderful lady that works at Gateway Pundit. I've known her for years, had dinner with her, hung out. She's an amazing person, has a lot of courage.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  She's been harassed and had a lot of threats because of her support of Assange. She's saying the word is Trump is set to announce his pardon imminently.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  So we're going to see what happens with that. That's what's coming out of a lot of sources.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Now, here's what happens. Trump will make a decision and then people hear about it and they all start leaking instantly.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  So he's made decisions before that have been reversed, but this is unfolding right now. Certainly it's the right thing to do.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Of the bad things Trump's done, he got snuckered into the vaccine stuff and I know why and I know the inside baseball and I've told you.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  I didn't mean I agreed with it. And not pardoning Assange earlier on, firing General Flynn who did nothing wrong.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  They were scared of Flynn because he was a patriot.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  He was going to go out of the deep state and understood the CHICOM takeover and was advising Trump of the Chinese, which is all confirmed now.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  General Flynn is a hero and a patriot and an amazing person.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  And you notice, though, he got a pardon and the federal judge said for the first time in US history, I don't care.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  The indictment continues on. We're going to have a panel of judges look at whether we continue to try you.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  That's not the Constitution.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  It's the Constitution that the president can pardon whoever he wants and that that is a check on out of control courts and the judiciary.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  But we're going to continue to watch this as it unfolds.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  But that's why Flynn and others are still having a lot of butterflies is because this is dangerous.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  And, you know, Flynn's saying Trump's going to win 100 percent. He's really pushing the resistance and fighting the globalist.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  And he knows that he's a major target and that they want to demonize him further.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  Speculations arrived. Donald Trump will pardon Winky Leeks, founder Julian Assange, activist, currently lodged at British prison, lodged in solitary confinement.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  Now, let's look at some of the other big news here that we're going to be covering next hour when Joe Hoft joins us.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  Feds issue emergency cybersecurity warning on company linked to Dominion.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Ex-intelligence operators say many machines intentionally and purposely flipped votes to Biden.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  In the John Bound report we just heard earlier, disqualify criminal Biden before it's too late. Very important to get that out.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  Ron Paul's made a good point. Congress, again, proves that the business of Washington is war.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  They had the Pentagon ignoring Trump, the Pentagon brass on getting troops out of the Middle East and other places.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  So we're going to do this white people are racist training, radical race theory training, which is ongoing.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  The Secretary of Defense said it continues and Trump fired him over it.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  But my good friend, who's a green beret and a patriot, I'm not going to say his name. He's been on the show before.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  He is in Utah right now and they are literally teaching him that heterosexuality is bad, that we're going to mention where red high heels put lipstick on.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  And this is just how you sabotage a country, folks. Period.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  And here it is in the news. Major transgender groups and major transgender activists say all children should be put on puberty blockers until they decide they're gender.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  And you're like, well, that's ridiculous. Well, no, that's the globalist plan. That's how you destroy people as you go after their sons.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  If you laugh at it, I laugh too. It's so absurd, but it's happening like keeping babies alive that you don't abort at nine months.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  So you go, well, we're going to keep it alive and extend it past because we're going to harvest its organs.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  But we're going to say under bioethics rules, we call it non resuscitation, not meaning resuscitating a heart or lungs that have stopped.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  But we legally say you are not a human. We wave a wand and you lose your rights at that point.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  That's where the bioethics is gone with PETA and Dr. Peter Singer and all these eugenics organizations.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  Simply amazing.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  And that ties into Michigan judge allows release of report from Dominion voting equipment forensic audit.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  Confirming that it's designed for fraud.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  The judge, the testimony, all of it, they say it's designed for fraud.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  That is coming up next hour.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  All right, let me do this.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  I got deeply into the big picture last hour, but I strewn it out over an hour because it's very complex.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  And so if you don't say things exactly right, and if you don't explain all the nuances to something, it can be turned against the truth.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  If you don't say it exactly right.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  So I'm somebody that's so truthful that it's hard to say certain things because I have trouble finding the words to explain it.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  Does that make sense?
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  But more important, you get discernment and a spiritual understanding and God has perfect knowledge.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  You should pray for discernment. You should pray for sight.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  You should pray for vision.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  I want to warn you, though, the Bible says that with knowledge comes great sorrow.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  We should put the quote, there's a lot of quotes, but the beginning of knowledge is great sorrow with great knowledge comes deep sorrow.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Because you won't have the Satanist enjoyment raping and killing children, but you will have to look into that.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  You will feel that.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  You will be in the ether.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  And everyone is already there, but God isn't going to do something to you that you don't ask for.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  And so if you ask to have pain, if you ask to feel what's happening in the psychic screen, it's there.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  God will test it out and give you a little bit at first to see if you can handle it.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  People ask, man, why have you aged so much?
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  I'd be dead if I hadn't taken all these supplements and everything.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  I have prayed, and I understood this more than 20 years ago, but it's been very intense, that I have be given discernment.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  And it's rough, folks. It's bad.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  And I have to make myself look into it.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  I have to make myself look at the enemy.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  I would describe it like Lord of the Rings, and he was a big Christian, a very deep guy.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  I was in World War I, J.R.R. Tolkien, and he wrote some books about that and the allegories for it.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  And that was his allegory of Satan versus God and the way it plays out here and angels and the rest of it.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  And he explained that, you know, it's like when you put the ring on, you can see all the bad stuff, but it sees you.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  So Frodo, or later Bilbo, Bilbo and then Frodo puts the ring on, it's like, I see you.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  Because that's what happens. You put on the spiritual understanding, or God gives it to you because you pray for it,
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  and then you give it to you in little doses here, learn to take this way, learn to take that way, learn to take this way.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  Then finally, it's like, okay, if I do much more of this, you can really hurt yourself. You sure you want this?
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  And if God thinks you're doing it for the right reason, I'll give you the discernment.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  But all I'm telling you is that people need to understand this is not a game.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  And this is good versus evil.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  And so that's one reason that I look so old and I look so exhausted is that everything becomes so much more intense
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  when you actually begin to seek truth and then don't lie to yourself and realize the truth.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Then it just opens up more and more and you see beauty, beauty is more beautiful.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  And goodness makes more sense and there's all these good things too.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  But then you are also aware of all the evil and you're not able to turn away from it or deny it.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  So it's the opposite of reveling in a sin. You become tortured by it and you experience it.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  The aloneness, the desperation, the people calling out for God to save them.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  And then you hear their voices.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  God's letting, oh, you want to hear this?
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  These children begging to be let out of dungeons.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  You want to hear what it's like people starving to death, being killed?
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Mothers dying because their kid was given a tainted vaccine?
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  Here, you want to be a superhero? You want to feel evil? I'll let you.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  And then you open yourself up and then what are you going to do about it?
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  And that's why evil knows to come in and you corrupt things.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Knowing we don't want to face it, we'll just turn things over to them.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  It's like taking a dump right in the middle of the Christmas dinner.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  Our entire modern system has been built to track and trace us.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  Not because we're doing anything wrong, but so we can be socially engineered and controlled.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  And now that's out of the open.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  One way to take back a lot of your power is to put your so-called smart phone in a privacy pocket
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  when you're not using it that way.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  Hackers, Illumina Gates, and the Clinton's contact tracers,
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  and all these big corporations that are setting up this tracking and control grid in the name of fighting COVID.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  They admit their internal documents are truly about a castle society control system.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  Don't have that power over you.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  They protect their locations. They protect where they're going and what they're doing.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  I can tell you, I was the first person 20 years ago said cover up the cameras on your computer.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And now, of course, Bill Gates and all of them admit they're doing that.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Mark Zuckerberg, show get your privacy pockets.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  They make great stocking stuffers and great gifts.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  They've been sold out for months at little Faraday cages in only $19.95.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  You're back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  Give the gift of privacy and security and safety with Privacy Pockets at infowarstore.com.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  It's been said that you should strike while the iron is hot.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Well, Info Wars is white hot right now.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  World government, globalist forces, trying to take over the United States is mainstream news.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  And Info Wars credibility has gone through the roof.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  That's why now is the time to contact local radio, TV, and cable stations.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  If you don't have an affiliate in your area already, and to send them to infowars.com forward slash affiliates.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  And say, pick up Alex Jones, pick up Omar Shroyer, pick up David Knight, pick up our other great programs.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  They're free to air.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  If you're on TV or you're on cable, you can cover up all the commercials for yourself.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  No contracts needed.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  This is your authorization stations.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Pick up the Info Wars feed right now.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  All the affiliates, the satellites, it's all linked at infowars.com forward slash affiliates.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  Go to the local stations, call them, email them, and send them the link to infowars.com forward slash affiliate.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  And tell them we're free to air, no contracts, just pick us up.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, we're here live.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  I said he's got his biggest announcement ever in the fourth hour today when he's hosting.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  So I'll definitely be tuned in for that.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  I went to Shroyer, described it like a basketball injury where his hamstring tore.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  And all of a sudden you're playing basketball and then bloop, you feel your hamstring tear and you can't walk very well.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  You had the same thing happen to me that first happened 25 years ago or so.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Screaming really loud in a rally.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  All of a sudden you feel something tear, it's your larynx.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  And it's like, you can't talk anymore.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  I actually tore my larynx again seven, eight years ago at that big Alamo speech that was so powerful.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  That was a great day down in San Antonio.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  I got up like, we'll never stop.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  And so that happened to Owen.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  And I guarantee you he'll be have a little bit deeper voice after this.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  It's like piano strings just tearing your larynx.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  And then you just get this big armored blob that sounds like you're 80 years old.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  Okay, let me, I'm not choking.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  It's the opposite.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  This news is so big and so out of control and so huge that I don't feel worthy to be covering.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  And I know you're the same way.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  And that's the problem.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  So many good men and women.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  They're black, they're Hispanic, they're white, they're Asian, they're male, they're female, they're straight, they're gay.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  There's everybody out there of all different types that want freedom and want life and want justice.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  And they just don't know how to say it.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  And they don't know how to describe all the ideas they have and everything that comes together with the knowledge they have.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  And so they don't say anything.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  And so I get that point of, if you can't say something absolutely perfectly accurate, you don't say anything.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Well, the problem is the globalist is going to lie all day and put out their disinfo and they love to lie on purpose.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  They're the opposite.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  You don't want to say anything wrong.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  You don't want to make a mistake.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  All they want to do is say stuff that's wrong because it's a spiritual thing.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  So I was so ready before the show and I was so zoned.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  And I think we said a lot of important things.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  I mean, I've got hundreds of articles here, hundreds of clips.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  It's all insane.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  Total proof of fraud, top forensic firms all over the US, Texas, Michigan, everywhere.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  There's fraud everywhere.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  The globalists are complete criminals.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  I mean, they're killing babies.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  They keep babies alive after they're born, folks.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  I mean, in harvest of damn organs.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  Yes, of course, we're in trouble.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  Of course, they've got human animal clones in China.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  People thought I made that up 20 years ago.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  It was in the fricking literature.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  The bottom has fallen out.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  Here, let me say it this way.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  It really doesn't matter if Trump gets reelected.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  Because we keep thinking, see, this is very complex.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  It's good that Trump's in there.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  We shouldn't want to steal the election.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  We need to get Trump in there.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  But if Trump gets in there, everybody goes back to sleep.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  And then he just battles a swamp and nothing gets done.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  But you put Joe Biden, the new world order in, which I do not want, by the way.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  But I can see where that leads.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  It's going to destroy them.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  There's no way they ever get out of this.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  I don't care how many wars they start.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  I don't care if they release bio weapons again.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  I don't care what they do, where the mask, all their little followers groveling.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  It's not going to work.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  Everything they do is going to blow up and explode.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  And it's disintegrating in front of our eyes like a vampire who's been drug out in the middle of the Sahara Desert at High Noon.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  I think that's really my message to you is it's in God's hands.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  But you can't then just say, well, it's in God's hands.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  I'm going to do nothing.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  No, no, God has to work through you.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  And this really just goes back to God because, I mean, here's an example, folks.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  They created COVID-19.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  It's got five viruses.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  I figured out what it is.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  And I know what's going to happen next.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  We have to understand.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  I know I'm right.
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  But I really don't want to tell you this.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  But I'm going to go ahead and tell you.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  COVID-19 is a binary weapon.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  It has five attacks it can launch.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  But what it does is unlock the five viruses they've already put into you.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  That when your hormone level hits a certain point, one of them activates.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  When it's hit by a certain electromagnetic field, another one activates.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  This is so sophisticated.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  When you take another vaccine, another one activates.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  And the taking of the vaccine itself, again, unlocks so many different levels to this.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  And this is so diabolically thought out.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  Because, again, I mean, you understand, you're getting the enemy operation right now.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  This is disgusting.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  If they hit you with one side effect from the vaccine, you'll catch them.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  If it's just sterilization or it's just cancer.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  That's what that Ben Garrison graph he made is just pure genius.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  Because you spin the wheel.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  But it's a little bit more than that.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  They've already tested five vaccines for sterilization, cancer, toxicity,
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  turning your immune system off, a cytokine storm, turning it up.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Those are the five things.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  Your kid, you spin the wheel.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  Your kid gets autism.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  You get cancer.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  Your kid dies.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Three free spins.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  You're tracked.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  Oh, you get death.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  Oh, you're sterilized.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  And you're like, why is this happening?
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  Because we didn't stand up for our children.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  And God said, OK, you didn't stand up for babies.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  You think God likes that?
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  And God goes, release the kraken when the gate opens and in comes Satan.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  That's it.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  Real simple.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  We deserve it.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  I deserve it.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  Now we're going to get it.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  And now the public and mass Stockholm syndrome, while the state is moon
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  chosen by proxy poisoning everybody, everyone will then commit to it and
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  cover it up because they all got in line with the great corruption.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  And then that begins the next chapters of what is going to unfold.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  So Bill Gates is sending five plagues upon the earth that will kill billions.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  This is the four horsemen, folks.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  You know the horse of plague, the green horse.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  The green movement, they told you this was a new green deal.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  This is the lower the carbon footprint.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  The green horse, whether you call it a precursor, a beta test or the big one,
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  the green horse of the antichrist has been released.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  This is it.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  So Merry Christmas.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  Kiss your ass goodbye.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major Robert Barons,
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  the planet by the 1920s, is all about corporate global governance.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  And now you're seeing it.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  Not just the blue states, the blue cities, the communists and socialist nations
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  all working in unison under UN control established a medical planetary dictatorship.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations themselves funded by
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  a handful of private central banking families.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  But they go back to the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  They're involved in plotting the world economy.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  That's what the social distancing the masks are all about.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  Those that comply are complying with your own destruction. Wake up.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  They want control. They want domesticated slaves.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  That's the process that is taking place right now.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  And when you shop at the big box stores and when you shop with Amazon,
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  remember that they are creating monopolies and they are the globalists
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  that are pushing the lockdowns, gun control, abortion, world government, all of it.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  If you want to do that, go ahead and shop there.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  We'll shop at InfoWars where we have thousands of products made right here in America
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  with our warehouses and our crew.

[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  If you want to stop the globalist at InfoWarsStore.com

[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  I want to thank you for thinking through what you do and where you spend your money
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  and do your shopping and get great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  Thank you.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men,
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  That's all the same in the end.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  Let me roll into the news here and the big picture and where the globalists are going
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  and how we stop them and what we're facing.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  But I just go back to the same message.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  We have given up on each other.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  We've given up on life.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  We've stopped standing up for ourselves.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  And that doesn't mean you or I specifically, but none of us are perfect.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  We've all fallen short. You know that.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  But imagine there are people that love reveling in evil.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  They love reveling in destruction.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  They're lazy. They have no cares.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  And with them death follows.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  The fourth seal, the pale green horse.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  When the lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, go.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  I looked and there was a pale green horse.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Its rider's name was Death and Hades followed him.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  They were given authority over one fourth of the earth, each horse,
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  to kill people using wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals of the earth.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  And that means humans that are no longer with God, zombies.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  Hear death and the world of death are personified.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  Go through the horses, pale horse.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Death rides the green horse.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  The world of death rides the fifth horse.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  Death.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  No doubt refers to great pestilence following the wars and famines of the first three seals.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  Tribulation.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  The sixth trumpet causes only a third of the men to be killed.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  The reference of the war is the first two seals.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  But you understand something.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  This is only the readying of the green horse.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  This is the beta test. They've got the gun out of the shooting range right now.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  And the vaccine is the implanting of the detonator switch in your DNA.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  That's why everybody's so upset. Everybody's so fighting mad.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  Everybody's fighting with each other. They know that something's wrong.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  Everyone's having incredible dreams. Everyone is so, so angry.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  Because you know at a metaphysical, spiritual level, you are being fitted for death.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  And then let me just do this. Let me just go ahead and just show you a bunch of mainstream news articles throwing this on your face right now.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  Ahead of Joe Hoff and all the big election news coming up next hour. Here, let's just look at this.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  And this all ties into what I'm about to cover, but here it is.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  Oh, Pierce Morgan slammed photographs out without a mask on in public at restaurants walking around the streets.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  Well, of course, that's for you, the slaves, not for him.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  NIH director begs Americans to swallow vaccine skepticism as Bill Gates eyes unofficial role.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  That's right. Boris Johnson announced a month ago.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  It almost got no coverage that Bill Gates will be the shadow leader.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  That's a British term.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  What is the bureaucracy that acts for the elected?
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  That's his words, though. Bill Gates will control the G8 for the rotating year that the UK has it right now, 2021.
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  And Bill Gates will decide for the G8, the medical policies.
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  And here is the National Institutes of Health director saying Bill Gates will direct it.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  He wants you to know he did it. He wants to take full ownership of it.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  Wow.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  And Bill Gates just told you, he said a year ago, or 10 months ago, he goes,
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  things won't open up until the end of 2021.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  Now he goes, I'm sorry, it's 2022 now.
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  And his wife came out and said, I, we didn't realize this would starve millions, but we're going to go ahead with it.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  See, that's the beauty of the four horsemen. The fear of the coming of the green horse, which you psychically know is coming.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  It'll kill the most of us billions. You're psychic. You're connected.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  You see in the future your own death. And so Gates trots out the green horse and says, hey, what do you think of this?
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  And then you take the green horse into you, you take his shots and you get implanted with a binary weapon.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  So he doesn't have it. You have it.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  He can activate one with electromagnetics. He can act another with chemicals. He will activate what he does to you.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  And to a Satanist like him, the sacrifice of billions, he is just, oh, this is ecstasy for him.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  It's all about his selfishness.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  And so they're telling you, Bill Gates is your doctor.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  Bill Gates says when your business can open, Bill Gates says we can go outside. Bill Gates is your pimp.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  He's your master, but it's okay. He funds black lives matter. He likes black people.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:33:03.000]  That's why he says black people need the shot first and then Melinda came out and she attacked Trump.
[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  She said, how dare him want to give it to Americans first?
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  Because Trump is only now figuring this out. Or it's a sick joke for Trump.
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  Oh, no, we're going to give it to the white people too. They're like, no, don't do that.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  But again, they've got the white people working for them. They're going to kill them. That's their main target.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  The globalists want to get everybody. Satan wants to get everybody. But they first go, oh, it's just these black people.
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  And then it's everybody. But let's continue. I'm giving you this, oh, this is the artworks, folks.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  They're hopping mad over this right now. I'm telling you exactly what they're doing.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  I told you eight months ago, 10 months ago, there's going to be HIV. There'll be false positive HIVs.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  I've got snopes. Jones claims they'll have trouble covering up the HIV positivity because it'll give it to people,
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  but they'll just claim it's a false positive. I mean, I've already foreseen their whole operation.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  Because I've got the big field marshal giving me the intel. The only question is, can you handle it?
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  The marshal will talk to you. But are you ready? Because you better do something or it doesn't talk to you anymore.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  God wants action now. Action now. No fear. God hates cowards. Stop caring about the enemy.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  Start caring about what God thinks. And then you'll start feeling God's power for real.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  Let's continue. More evidence shows total deaths in 2020 are no different than prior years.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  Open up the economy. Incredible article. That's right. Even our population's gone up by 3 million.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  People coming in. There's as many deaths this year, right online as last year.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  Because they're just calculating and calling it deaths with a fake PCR test, which is incentivized by the 52,000 shemolians
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  that you get when somebody has COVID in your hospital.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  Funny how $50,000 incentivizes people to do stuff like that. Isn't that funny? Isn't that funny?
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  Oh, here's another one. Melinda Gates last week. We hadn't really thought through the economic impacts.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  Go read her full speech. She's like, oh, we're sorry, but the lockdowns continue.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  Yeah, it's going to kill a lot more than COVID. But hey, we're liberal.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  And here's the guy at the WHO that runs it told you about this a long time ago.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  He ran the extermination of Christians in Ethiopia for the Muslim takeover.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  Look at that guy. Report WHO chief. Ted Rose could face genocide charges.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  That's the CHICOM operative. He killed over 2 million Christians.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  And he did it with a U.N. and the Chinese help. And guess what happened? It's real funny.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Only hit certain wells.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  Weaponized cholera.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  Killing those black people again. Aren't you, buddy boy? But he's liberal. So it's okay.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Here's Bill Gates. Like I told you, oh, first we wouldn't be back till 2021.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  Oh, sorry. 2022 now. Oh, you never go back to normal.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  Oh, and then here's all the articles about Alex Jones is wrong from 10 months ago, February.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Oh, Alex Jones is wrong. Oh, there's no HIV insertions.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  And what's the headline out of the city morning, Harold? HIV insertions.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  Insertions. Have they insert something in a wild virus?
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  Hmm. It's kind of like evolution. It's not true.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  They're right back. Stay with us.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  Well, Mr. Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News. Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  COVID more dumbest thing they could ever imagine.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  Okay. It's a quarter million.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  If you count all of the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had co-morbidity.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  These are real numbers. These are real facts.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  This is the chicken little event.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  We all run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  Well, the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  You could stand up against it. This is slavery.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer are all pushing.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  The cub is the most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically bioweapons and are super deadly.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  And now they're having to resuscitate people that die, basically.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  When they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  They have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  And that's on the record. It does that.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  Guillain-Barre, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you,
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  it's safe and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  And then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous,
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  because the media says it's safe. They do it.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  Fox has betrayed President Trump, as I predicted they would.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  They've always been part of the establishment, and it's only going to get worse.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for second term on January 20th,
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  They're going to cut off the energy source to the U.S.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  This is economic domination. This is economic war.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  We are being consolidated. We are being taken over.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  Cloud Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  That's what social distancing is.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  So your business is only at 25 percent for several more years.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  No small businesses will be there.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  This is a master plan. Say no.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  So we don't stand up for ourselves. We follow Satan.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  And we don't care about our own human lives and care about others.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  God will remove himself from the equation and let evil take over,
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  just as a natural report you sow equation.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  And so you can look at this as evil taking over and how horrible it is.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  Believe me, I'm not happy about it at all.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  Or you can look at it as justice.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  And believe me, the wicked are going to get a lot worse than we are.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  But who would blame God if God said,
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  look, you're sterilizing your boys, you're killing most your kids,
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  you're devil worshiping, you don't care, you're lazy, you're dumb.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  I'm just going to blow the whole planet up and redo something else.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  I mean, God made us. That's God's right.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  But God's not going to do that.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  The globalists say the earth's failed and fallen.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  They're going to destroy it and create something new.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  That's actually what Satan's doing.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Because Satan's not about free will.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  Satan's about inversion and total power and total control.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  God has blessings, Satan has curses.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  God has life, Satan has death.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  And you better know, Satan is 100% real as real as God is.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Because that's how the universe is.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  And free will demands there be a Satan.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  Because somebody's going to play the role of Satan.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  My gosh, don't we see that with humankind?
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  So let me just try to boil it down to this.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  Because I've gone through this myself and I know you're going through this right now.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  You know you're being robbed. You know the globalists are evil.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  You say, why aren't other Americans standing up?
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  They are. They're being silenced.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  They're not leaders though.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  So they need you to lead them.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  And you need to try to be a leader.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  You need to be a leader.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  Don't try. Do it.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  To quote Yoda. Don't try. Only do it.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  And it's absolutely true.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  And so that's why I'm calling on this audience of activists. You're amazing.
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  Don't just set it to make you feel good.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  You are the heart of the resistance. You're the people they hate.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  You're the people that know the truth.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  I've looked into your beautiful eyes.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  I tell you, man, I go all over the country and I see a family of white people,
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  a family of black people, a family of Asians, Hispanics, mixed up, whatever.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  Their children all are glowing.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  Their parents are glowing.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  Or they might be old people.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  With hunchbacks and bad knees with their eyes,
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  when they look at my eyes, I see the fire of God.
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  And I tell you, I don't see that in the eyes of Joe Biden and the enemy, do you?
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  So let's stop thinking we're losers.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  We're only losers when we stop dialing in to God's spirit.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  And so I don't try to be a preacher, folks,
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  but it's at times like these that I'll just level with you.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  And I'll tell you, we brought all this on ourselves.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  And I'm not happy about what's going to happen.
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  But they're launching the bio attack.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  And Trump got swindled, I know, thinking Gates said,
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  my vaccine won't be ready for two years.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  And so Trump, like, tried to rush regular ones,
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  but then they go, oh, our mRNAs are the really bad ones.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  They're already, and that's what we got hit with
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  because Trump's not in control of the bureaucracy.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  That's been proven.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  They don't do a damn thing he says.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  He says, don't make troops wear high heels.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  All troops wear high heels now.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  I mean, you know, it's, it's just, it's just, you know, that's, that sounds dumb.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  Well, when we're talking about high heels,
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  they're injecting the troops with all this crap.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  You think they just tested all these deadly vaccines on our military?
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  For no reason.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  They did it to have control over the enforcers
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  and to have them where they wanted them, and now they're moving on to us.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  You take the soldiers out, you take the men out first,
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  then you got everybody else.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  And so when I get up here and I bring up all this dire news
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  and I tell you how much trouble you're in,
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  I don't do that to scare you.
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  I do it like a Janice Joplin song,
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  that we should cue it up to that next segment or go out with it.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  The part where she says,
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  And if you don't have anything else to lose, you're not free.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  And that's what I'm here to tell you.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  We got to lose it all.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  We got to lose the entertainment.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  Hollywood's a curse anyways.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  The fancy crap, but not loving our own children,
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  not being all of us are decked up.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  We've all been raised in this evil and it's all going to get taken away.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  The Satanists think they're going to get more power and more money
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  and more control.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  No, this is the end of them.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  This is God pulling the plug,
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  flushing the commode.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  And we're sitting here in this commode floating around with Joe Biden
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  and Kamala Harris thinking, man, we're cursed.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  This is bad.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  God should have pulled the plug a long time ago.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  So embrace it.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  And get with your children and your neighbors and your family
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  and pray to God and get on your damn knees.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  Because you're not God, God's God.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  And repent and God will heal our land.
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  But not before he burns this son of a bitch down.
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  You better get that straight.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  God's going to burn this sucker down.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  God's going to tear everything up, throw it down.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  And he's going to let these Satanists have their way with us
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  until that last minute and God's going to grab those comodes by the neck
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  and grab those Joe Biden's by the neck
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  and grab those nuisance by the neck
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  and grab Merkel and all of them that are so scared of Satan,
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  they rolled over and did this for power because they're all scared.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  You know, these people don't do this because they even like it at the top.
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  They do it because they're scared.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  Why are you so scared, Merkel?
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Why are you so scared, Boris Johnson?
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  Why are you so scared?
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  Because, you know, you picked the wrong side.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  And you don't want to take the attacks now with a little,
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  a little abutian Satanist.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  And you're just hoping you figure out some immortality
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  or some computer or some thing like Faust that gets you out of this
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  and it's not going to do that for you.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  You're not going to get out of this.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  You're going to burn.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  And if I'm a little piece of kindling, that's the secret, isn't it?
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  I'm the match that lights your ass on fire.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  I say burn me first.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  But it's got to be done God's way, not our way.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  We're not offensively violent.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  We don't go out and start fights.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  We let God use us.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  And then you just turn it over to God.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  And then magically it all starts happening.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  And the more you turn it over to God, it's like, whoa, OK, well now.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  And everything you do has a totally different effect.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  And you think something's a defeat, you learn a year later.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  It was your greatest victory, like the Garth Brooks song.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  Some of God's greatest gifts run answered prayers.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  All right, I got to go to break.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  And we got Joe Hoff coming on with the big news.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  And I only had part of this.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  It's not about tootin' my horn.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  It's about how crazy it is if you type in.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  There's literally, I said 20.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  That's the ones I looked at.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  There's more than that.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  There's all this quote, fat checking.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  Every globalist outlet calls itself a fat checker now,
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  because they think it fools certain people.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  They're like, Jones is insane with no basis in reality.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  He says that there is HIV insertions in the COVID virus
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  and that people that protect the vaccine may get HIV or test
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  positive.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  Look at these articles.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  Look at this.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  It's in the articles, one in Guardian.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  And then now, 10 months later, it's happening.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  That's hilarious, folks.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  People go, how the hell do you know that?
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  If it's a damn HIV virus, and then they created a tenuated version,
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  because it's a live virus, it's going to say you got HIV.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  If you take a live HIV virus, you're probably going
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  to come up positive for it.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  People keep asking me, Jones, how the hell do you know that?
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  How do you know this?
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  How'd I know it?
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  I'm reading what it is.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  All right.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Listen, if you don't find this, we won't be there.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  And that's God's will.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  I barely plugged these days, whatever.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  Christmas is here.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  Could be the last Christmas.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  Could be the beginning of something new, whatever.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  The point is, is that there's a big study out that they're
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  really pissed about it.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  It's a global star.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  It's like 80% of the people that were hospitalized with COVID
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  didn't have D3.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Well, folks, if you don't have oxygen, you're going to die, too.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  It just takes four minutes.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  With D3, it takes six months.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  We've got great D3 in the prostate guard for men.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  Women can take it, too.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  And it's got all the other vitamins and minerals in it.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  So it's a really good product designed for your prostate,
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  but it works for women as well.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  It's kind of like that old ad they had for whatever kind of deodorant
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  was strong enough for a man, but made for a woman.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  I mean, just because it's good for your prostate
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  and a bunch of studies, sawpomato is good for everything.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  In fact, some studies show it's better for women
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  than it is for men.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  Amazing, miraculous, but it's got all the vitamins and minerals
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  on top of it, prostate guard, a great stocking stuffer,
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  and these little contact tracer pouches.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  You just put your phone in so you can actually go around
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  and not be tracked by them.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  Just pull the phone out when you want to and use it.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  Those are at infowarstore.com.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  And we've got Alpha Power back in, X2, X3, DNA Force Plus.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  And a bunch of stuff is getting ready to sell out.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  Thank you for funding us and thank you for your prayers and support.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  Get your orders in by the 18th.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  By the 18th, we'll get them before Christmas.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  All right.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  We got Joe Hoff coming up.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  I'm going to dig through our archives.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  We got a lot of footage, but sitting the best audio bow and speech.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  I thought it was powerful.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  And we haven't aired it.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  I've been asking us to air this last day, but for whatever reason we didn't.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  But here's a short speech Owen gave.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  The Jericho rally in D.C. on Saturday.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  I thought it was important.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  And here it is.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  It doesn't matter because God wins.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  And we have been betrayed by the Supreme Court.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  It was never the Republican Party's revolution.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  It was always our revolution.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.

[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[1:59:54.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.

[2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  It was never the Supreme Court's revolution.
